The days are getting warmer, but the nights are still cold. If I walk indoors, I'm doing 10 loops for heavy walks and 5 loops for light walks.Earlier, we had about 3-4 inches of snow, so I walked loops within my house the next morning. The weather for the last few days has been a mixture of light rain, light snow, and light sunshine.Judy found my long pants that I use for running, and I wore the long pants to keep my legs warm during my walk. I've gained weight so the pants are pretty tight on me. The pants are a medium and I need a large size or even an extra large size. This week has been a windy-week, and I am glad I had my wind-breakers on as a jacket and long pants.Back in Massachusetts, when I was younger, I wore the long pants when I ran at below freezing temperatures with a wind blowing. My record for cold-weather running is -18 (F) (with long pants but no wind). Because of my older age and my now living in a warmer climate, I don't expect to break that record."},

A heavy walk is approximately twice that of a light walk Because of snow and cold temperatures, I'm doing my walking inside my house. Also, the bad air we currently have is a factor in my decision to walk indoors. It is getting warmer with better air, so I am going outside again. The weather is cold again, and there is more snow.

My wife (Judy) was glad I aborted the walks andthat I didn't try to do the distance that I had planned. Towards the end of the month the temperature was below freezing and the wind was blowing. It was very cold! My legs got awfully tired, although I completed the distance in my goals. Later, my legs felt fine for abut 0.2 miles and then they started getting tired. During the following weeks, my legs were fine, because I drank more water the day before and after my walks. We had company towards the end of the third week of the month, I went running after the company left, and my legs were very tired. We had about 12 inches of snow after the company left, and I didn't walk during that time to give my legs a good rest. I felt weak, though, the whole week. Judy and two neighbors, Mr. Cox and Brother McDonald, they have snow blowers, removed the snow from our driveway and the sidewalk in front of our house. I didn't walk much during the days of snow and cold. Not walking  gave my legs extra rest. I have not been doing stretches after the walks and this omission finally caught up with me. My legs felt like I was walking for the first time. I didn't walk for a couple of days and the I started walking again, although at a shorter distance."},

For my Light walks, I was going the east loop one time. My legs got quite tired during my walks, so I went to to a different method of weekly walks that reduced the stress on my legs. I changed from alternating Heavy and Light walks (3 walks each) to one Long walk on Saturday, and one Medium walk on Wednesday, with rest walks on Monday, Tuesday and Thursday, and no walks on Friday, and Sunday. Since Sunday is my Sabbath, it is always a \"no run or walk\" day. This means, under the new system, that  I am walking 5 days per week instead of the 6 days per week that I was doing under the Heavy/Light method. This week has Thanksgiving, and I'm not sure what effect that holiday will have on this distance. Later: Judy did not go walking all of the days this month because she was busy getting the turkey and apple pies ready for Thanksgiving and a birthday dinner, a few days later for our grand daughter, Annie Grace. My daughter, Sara, and two of her four kids are down from Evanston,WY, and they are available to help my wife with the preparations for Thanksgiving dinner. I did my normal walk on Thanksgiving day, because our Thanksgiving dinner is in the late afternoon. The dinner for Annie Grace, on her day, is in the early afternoon, so I went walking in the morning.  With my age and health, I'm not of much help to Judy. I lose my balance while walking on elevation changes, and I try to walk on level ground or on ground that has a gradual change i.e. I try to avoid stairs. In addition, I don't bend over to pick up things. Also, I don't drive any more so Judy does all of the shopping.We had Good or Moderate air this month, but the sky was cloudy during much of the month, and rain was forecast towards the end of the month. I was usually out and back before the rains came, and the rains, when they did come, were mostly sprinkles. There was some snow in the mountains and a bit of snow here, but the snow here was melted by the time I went out walking. We had a strong frost on a few nights, and the temperature was still below freezing when I went walking after those nights.My weeks (starting with a Monday) now look like the following: Rest, Rest, Medium, Rest, None, Long, None. This method gives fewer miles per week but puts my focus on the Long and Medium walks"},

Later I had surgery for skin cancers that were on my head.I went off my cancer medicine of three pills each night because the medicine wasn't keeping my PSA low any more. I then began taking a different medicine of 3 pills per night. I did feel tired after taking the new medicine, and I had a difficult time walking in my house. I'm still taking the new medicine for my prostate cancer, but I have gotten used to the new medicine, and I do OK getting around my house. With a new week starting, I want to increase my distance, so I walked around the east loop for my heavy walk.I've also been taking a different prescription of one pill twice a day, in addition to taking the 3 pills at night. Recently the doctor decided to ween me from the daytime prescription, and he cut my dose down to 2 pills one day, and one pill the next day day. Starting with yesterday, the doctor cut me down to one pill per day. I'm looking forward to taking no pills at all for that prescription, and thus doing away with the prescription. I still will take 3 pills at night of the new medicine. When I have my blood tested in a couple of weeks, I'll find out if my PSA has gone down or not due to the new medicine. I'm looking forward to the resurrection. Until then, I'm learning more about patience and obedience.The doctor is trying to keep me off a chemotherapy/radiation treatment like people usually have,  because he feels I wouldn't be able to withstand the stress from that treatment and soon would die from it. He hopes the pills will cause less stress on my body and still control my cancer.The air has been Good or Moderate so far this month. The smoke from California fires seems to be going some place else."},

I still alternate heavy and light walks, but the distance of each walk has slowly increased as I gained my strength back. I felt very weak after drinking a lot of of radioactive water prior to having scans made of my skeleton and body. In addition, part of the month was spent gaining strength from the mho surgery for skin cancers on my face and forehead. I haven't gone walking or running while I've recovered from the surgery, although I did walk today and in the future. I've taken 2 or 3 tablets of Tylenol daily, for two or three days, to reduce the pain of the surgery. The bottle of Tylenol states I shouldn't take more than 8 tablets per day to avoid damage to my liver.I go walking or running only if I can see the mountains east of SLC or I can see their outlines. This translates to Good or Moderate air. If I can't see the mountains or their outlines, I don't walk or run, because in that case the smoke is pretty thick, and the air is bad. The smoke comes from big fires in California.The past few days haven't been bad. The mountains were in sight, and some of the details were visible. There was some smoke in the mountains, but not an awfully lot. Today had an increase in smoke, but the mountains were still visible. I guess the fires in California are still raging."},

The air is still dirty, but it is not as bad as it was two weeks ago. At least I now can see the mountains east of SLC and make out some details in the mountains. For the first time in several days, I can see the Oquirrh mountains west of SLC and the details of the open-pit copper mine that is taking over the mountains.. The current temperature in the shade of our deck is 84 (F).I walked in the evening on Thursday, because I had a doctor's appointment at 9 am. I wore three layers, in the evening, but two layers would have been sufficient. On Saturday I wore two layers, and that was about right.On Saturday, I planned to walk one lap, but I didn't quite make it. I completed about 0.6 miles, and then I was too tired to do more. The radioactive water I drank just before my body scans on Thursday made me tired for several days. Thanks to four ward members who saw me and took me home.On Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, I plan on doing Heavy runs or walks, and on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday I plan on doing Light runs or walks. This schedule alternates Heavy and Light runs or walks, for 6 days of activity per week. Sunday is always a rest day, because it is my Sabbath day. Because of my age I am walking instead of running."},

In order to further reduce the time required for updating this blog, I am now making monthly additions to this blog, using data from the last week of that month. All of the distances will be in miles.These additions will include the NUMBER OF DAYS that I have walked during that week, plus the length of my HEAVY walks and LIGHT walks plus the TOTAL miles for that week, The Heavy and Light walks are alternated. This will allow me to keep track of my physical exercise with significantly less time in adding to the blog. The first \"monthly\" entry to this blog is actually for two weeks and then it goes to monthly additions.The format for each addition to this blog will be similar to the following, for the last week of the month. Due to my age and health, I am walking instead of running:DAYS WALKED:HEAVY WALK:LIGHT WALK:TOTAL MILES for WEEK: Comments:The numbers apply to the last week of the month.

I've received similar comments on previous days about my walking.The air is still bad but not as bad as it was a couple of weeks ago.Friday. I walked three loops in the following order: west, east, east. In addition, I walked 0.2 miles to get extra distance. I was out about 7:15 am (F) and back about 9:50 am. There was a mild south breeze blowing, with gusts of the breeze about 10 mph. The air is still bad but not as bad as it was a couple of weeks ago. Now, I not only can see the outline of the mountains, I am starting to see some of the details in the mountains. Two weeks ago I couldn't see the mountains at all.In addition to going a specific distance, I push my stroller  for that distance. I push my stroller, because it helps me keep my balance, and I go faster than I would go with help from a cane or just walking with no help from a stroller or a cane.Saturday. The air is not as bad today as it has been in past days and weeks. I can see across the SL valley and see the mountains east of the city. I can see details in the mountains, such as snow in the tops of the mountains. There is still smoke in the air over the valley, but things are improving!I was out about 8:10 and the temperature was in the 60s (F), and I was back at 10:00 and the temperature was in the low 70s. I walked two loops (east, west) and walked 0.2 miles further for extra distance. Each loop is 0.625 in length. I jogged a few steps in the middle of my walking. There was a mild but gusty south breeze blowing, with each gust about 5 mph. Judy was busy mowing the lawns and didn't walk with me.Sunday. The air is still bad because of a large fire in Parley's canyon, I hope the air will allow walking and running this coming week!"},

I walked around the east loop, going faster than I've been doing. I was out at about 9:00 am. The sky was full of clouds, but the temperature was nice, probably in the 80s (F). Judy didn't go with me.Thursday. I walked around the east loop and the west loop. Judy didn't go with me, because she was getting ready for a \"doll party\" that she is having for our younger granddaughters and younger granddaughters of her sister, Heidi Marchant. Judy expected about 21 people to attend the party.I was out about 11:00 am. It was hot in spaces that were not shaded. I went slow because the party was in session; I was basically waiting for the party to be over. All 21 people attended the party. The kids seem to be having fun at the party.There was a nice south wind blowing of about 10-15 mph, that helped to cool me off. Friday. Judy and I walked the east loop.

I walked three loops and was pretty tired when I finished, both from the heat and from the distance. One lady from our ward told my wife that I was walking faster, but to me it seamed like I was walking slower. At any rate, regardless of how fast or slow I was going, it was hot during the last lap.If I was walking faster, that fact could account for my being tired when I completed my walk.Tuesday.  I walked two loops plus I went 0.4 miles further for additional distance. I walked faster than I usually go and took fewer rest stops. I usually take 3 rest stops during the east loop and 2 rest stops during the west loop. Today I took 1 rest stop each loop. I did, though, take a longer rest stop at home between the two loops.My goal this week is to walk  0.2 miles extra per day. I did 0.4 miles extra today because I didn't do the extra yesterday.  The temperature during my walk was in the 70s (F). The sky was cloudy for both loops and about half of the extra distance.

I walked around two loops (the east an the west loops). I was out at 8 am, so it wasn't particularly hot. I finished the loops at 9:15, and I felt pretty good when I finished. My body was tired from the heat but not from the walking. After my walk, Judy drove me to the hospital to get a blood test, prior to my Internet visit with my cancer doctor on Tuesday afternoon."},

I walked the west loop and then walked the east loop. While doing the west loop I stopped at Craig Young's house and gave him a copy of the Let's Laugh book. He recently had an artificial knee, and I figured a few jokes would help him deal with being in the house all day. Judy had planned on walking with me during the 2nd lap, but I couldn't find her when the time came to do the east loop, so I did it alone. I was out at 7:45 am and back at 9:30 am. I didn't check the temperature, but it felt like it was in the 60s (F) or 70s. Lots of sun!I was pretty tired when I finished the two laps, and I'm glad this is a rest week. I did a  \"heavy\" walk of two laps, instead of the normal three laps.Tuesday. Today is a continuation of the rest week, and I did a \"light\" walk of one lap instead of the normal two laps. I walked the east loop and was very tired at the end of the loop. It was all I could do to get my stroller up the four stairs to my front door and get the stroller parked inside my house.There was a gusty south breeze of about 5-10 mph. I was out at about 8:35 am and back about 9:30 am.Wednesday. I walked the east loop and Judy and I walked the west loop. I felt stronger today than I did two days ago. I'm glad this is a rest week, because I don't know if I could do more laps of the loops. Today, I did two laps of the loops instead of three laps. I was out about 8:30 am, and the sky was cloudy and mostly the sun was behind clouds. We may have thunder showers today, but so far we haven't had any storms. The temperature when I left home was in the 60s (F). There was a south wind blowing of about 15-20 mph.Thursday. Judy and I walked around the east block. We left about 8:30 am when the temperature was is the 60s (F). There was a south wind blowing of about 15 mph. I felt pretty good when our walk was finished. Our walk was enough for a rest week of reduced distance.Friday.  I walked around the east loop and then Judy and I walked around the west loop. I was out about 7:25 am and back about 9:20 am. The sky was mostly cloudy during most of the east loop, but the sky changed during the latter part of the east loop and all of the west loop, such that the sun caused the temperature to rise. The temperature was about 66 (F) when I went out and was about 75 when I finished my walks. A slight south breeze was blowing. During most of my walk, I couldn't detect any breeze at all.Much later. Judy and I walked 0.4 miles to attend a going-away party for a neighbor. The temperature was in the 90s (F).Saturday. Today is the last day of this rest week of reduced distance. I was out at 7:50 am and back at 8:30 am. I walked around the east loop. The temperature during my walk was in the  60s (F) to 70s.  The was a south wind blowing, about 10-15 mph. I felt pretty good when I finished my walk."},

I was back about 11:30 am and the temperature was about 83. I walked the east loop, and Judy and I walked the west loop, and I walked to the corner and back, then I had a breakfast of french toast. There was no wind or breeze to speak of.At 1:30 pm Judy said the temperature was up to 101. Even though I was late getting out, I'm glad I didn't wait until mid afternoon to go out.Tuesday. I went out about 9:30 am, when the temperature was in the 60s (F) and returned about 11:00 when the temperature was in the 80s. My wife and I walked the east loop, and I walked the east loop again. There was a gusty south wind blowing of about 20 mph during the gusts.Wednesday. I was out about 8:30 when the temperature was in the 70s (F).  I walked the east loop twice twice and the west loop once. Judy walked the east loop once.Thursday. I walked twice around the east loop, and Judy walked with me on my second pass around the loop. It rained a bit, and it was raining during my first pass around the loop. Actually, it was just a light sprinkle during my first pass around the loop. The temperature during my first pass was in the mid 60s (F). During my second pass, the rain stopped and the sun came out. There was no detectable wind blowing.Later: In the afternoon, we had a heavy rain for a while. I don't have any stats for the rain, but it was a heavy rain. We really need the rain!Friday. I walked around the east loop twice, and Judy and I walked around the west loop once. The temperature during our walk walk was in the 60s (F), with a south wind of about 5-10 mph. Today I took my GPS with me and measured the actual mileage around the west loop. The numbers that I have been using for that loop have been my estimates, and the actual distance is a bit longer. Starting with today, I'm using the actual mileage instead of my estimates. The error in the west loop distance has been slight, and I am not going back to previous walks to correct the distance.Saturday. I walked the east loop and Judy and I walked the west loop. I was out at 8:30 and back about 10:15. The temperature was 60 (F) when I left home. I didn't feel any breeze at first, but I felt a slight south breeze during the middle of our walks. My body felt strong during my walks, but my legs got awfully tired at the end of my walks. I didn't eat anything before I went to bed, and I thus was very tired this morning. The sun was hot!!"},

Going around the west block is the same distance that I have been doing. I wore long sleeves to protect against skin cancers on my arms. I was out about 8:15 and back about 9:45, but it was hot! There was a gusty south wind blowing of about 5-15 mph. I felt pretty good when I finished my walk. Tired but not fatigued.Tuesday. Today was a light day. While Judy watered her garden I walked the east loop and went most of the way around the loop again; I went south to the corner, turned left and went east to the next corner. Then  I returned to my home. The extra distance was about 0.6 miles instead of the 0.625 miles around the loop. The next time I add distance to the light walk, I will go all the way around the east loop again. I left about 8:15 am and returned about 9:30 or 10:00 am. The temperature was 71 (F) when I left and 80 when I returned. There was a south wind blowing of about 10-15 mph. I felt pretty good when my walk was finished. I think I am going a bit faster on my walks. I don't control my speed. If I'm tired, I slow down. If I feel good I speed up.Later, in the afternoon: My wife just notified me that our thermometer outside says 106 (F), a new record for this area; the temperature reading outside is a shade-temperature. I'm glad I went walking this morning. The temperature outside went to 107 before it started to go down.Wednesday. I walked the east loop. Then Judy and I walked the west loop, and I walked south to the corner and back for extra distance. Judy was already outside in her garden when I left to go walking. I left about 7:45 and the temperature was in the 60s (F) am. I came in the house about 9:15, and the temperature was in the 80s. There was no noticeable breeze blowing. I felt pretty good about my walking today.Thursday. I walked the east loop and then walked to the southeast corner of Congressional street for extra distance. I was out about 6:30 am and back about 7:45 am. The temperature during my walk was in the 60s (F). It is kinda hard to get up early, but it is very nice to be out before the sun comes up, and there was lots of shade from the houses and trees. There was no breeze blowing.Friday. I walked the East loop, and Judy and I walked the West loop. Then I walked south to the corner and back. I was out at 7:30 and back by 9:10 am. The temperature was in the 80s (F) and 90s. There was no breeze or wind blowing, and the sky was cloudy with shade for most of the way.Saturday. I walked around the east loop and, for extra distance, I walked most of the second pass over the east loop. The temperature when I left home was 73 (F). I didn't check the temperature when I returned, but the temperature was probably in the 80s. There was no wind while I walked. Judy walked most of the extra distance."},

I walked the east loop and then walked to the power box on 100th South for extra distance. I didn't check the temperature before I left or came back, but I was out about 9 am and back at 10:30 am. There was a slight south breeze blowing.I didn't eat much last night, but I ate a big breakfast before I left. I was tired during the east loop, but I felt better during the extra distance; I was still tired though. I need to eat more for supper and less for breakfast.I had been home for a few hours when we left for Springville and a birthday and anniversary dinner. The dinner was with Tova, our 4th child, and her family. Judy and I were married on her birthday on June 7, 1963. Today is Judy's 80th birthday and the start of our 58th year of marriageTuesday. I walked the east loop, taking only one short break of less than one minute at the end of Congressional street. I reached home but didn't stop for a break. I felt fine so I kept on walking up to the corner and back for a total distance of 1.025 miles. I felt pretty good when I got back home, so I guess that burger I had at about 6 pm last night served its purpose by giving me strength this morning. The burger was my way of participating in a family gathering, and it was my way of eating more for supper and less for breakfast.There was a brisk south wind blowing during my walk. I didn't check the temperature when I left and returned, but it was probably in the 60s (F) or perhaps in the 70s. The temperature in the hallway of my home went up several degrees, indicating it was pretty warm outside. The AC and heater were off during this increase in hallway temperature.Wednesday. I walked around the east loop, and I then went to the corner then turned right and went to the power box on 100th South for extra distance.  I was out at 8:45 am. I didn't check the temperature when I left or when I got back, but it was probably in the 70s (F) or 80s. There was a 10-15 mph wind blowing with gusts at 25 mph. The forecast is for triple digits in the afternoon, and then a cold front  for a day or two will come through with cooler temperatures.I had a good supper last night, but I had no breakfast before my walk. I felt pretty good during my walk, but I was a bit more tired than yesterday. I will do this same route and distance on Friday. Tomorrow and Saturday will be a shorter walk.Thursday. I was out at 8:45 am and back at 10:00 am. The temperature was in the 60s (F) while I walked. There was a brisk north wind blowing, from 5 mph to about 25 mph. I had a good supper last night, but I didn't eat anything before I walked this morning. I didn't take any rest breaks during my walk around the east loop, but I rested a few minutes at home before I walked to the corner and back for extra distance. I took no rest breaks during the extra distance, and I felt pretty good when my walk was finished.Friday. I was out walking about 8:40 I walked the east loop with no rest breaks. After a small break at home, I walked the additional distance to the power box on 100th South and back (0.6 miles). I enjoy the 0.1 mile stretch on 100th South, because it is almost all shade and nice to walk. Tomorrow is a short walk of 1.025 miles, and I think that next week I'll add a bit to my walking, both long and short walks.I had a pretty good supper last night, including two cheese sandwiches, including chips, and a can of Chicken Noodle Soup. This food was consumed late at night, about an hour before I went to sleep.Saturday. I walked around the east loop and walked to the corner and back for extra distance. Judy walked with me around the east loop but didn't do the extra distance with me.My watch ran out of battery power. I thought I was getting up at 6 am, but in reality I got up at 9 am. I was pretty tired when I finished my walk. There was a slight south breeze blowing. I didn't keep track of times or temperatures, but it is getting warm again. I'm glad that tomorrow is a no-walk day; I need the rest of a no-walk day. Because tomorrow is the Sabbath day, I can forget about walking and devote my self to the church and to family. So far this week, I have averaged a little over 1 mile per walk. I am ending this week in the 6+ range of miles, and the following week I should be in the 7+ range of miles, although I haven't calculated the distance I should do each day to reach 7 miles per week."},

That is 0.2 miles more than past walks. Judy didn't walk with me because she is getting ready for our company that is coming today. There was no breeze and the temperature was in the mid 50s (F) while I walked.Tuesday. I added 0.2 miles to my distance, and I walked the new distance and was back before 10 am. I was very tired, but I got the stroller up the stairs to my front porch, so I wasn't so tired that I needed help with the stroller. The temperature was in the mid 60s (F) while I walked. There was a slight south breeze of about 4 mph.Wednesday.  I walked around the east loop, and I went to the corner and west to the power box for extra distance. This the same walk I had on Monday. I didn't check the temperature at the beginning and end of my walk, but it was hot. Thank goodness for the shade during my walk. I was pretty tired during the last 0.6 miles, but I made it home. I got my stroller up the steps to the front porch, but I had to retry my effort to get the stroller up to the front porch. There was a slight gusty south breeze of about 5-10 mph on the gusts. Judy didn't go for the walk, because she and Kirsten, our granddaughter who is staying with us for the week, were busy doing yard work. Thursday. I walked around the east loop. We then drove to Brighton and walked around Silver Lake. The path was easy to traverse, except for about 200 feet that was downhill and had snow on the path. I put on the breaks of the stroller and let the stroller slide downhill on the snow and dirt. My feet slipped on the snow, and I was glad for the stroller to help me keep my balance. I took small steps while walking on the snow. The snow was packed into ice.We ate our lunch on a table that was next to the lake. The table was in the shade of large pine trees. We didn't go up to Lake Mary. Lake Mary was only about 1.5 miles away, but the trail to Lake Mary was steep and not compatible with the stroller. On the way out of the loop around the buildings, Judy showed us where she worked before we were married. On the way back we had tire problems, and we stopped at the tire shop at a Walmart. While we were waiting for the car, I sat in the stroller while Judy and Kirsten, our granddaughter, wandered around the store.Friday.  I walked the east loop and then took a long break (several minutes) at home. Then I did the extra distance for a total of 0.6 miles more. Thanks to the extra distance walking around Silver Lake yesterday, I almost broke into 6+ miles today. I was pretty tired during the extra-distance today, but I got the stroller on the porch and in the house by myself. There was a south breeze blowing of about 10-15 mph, which helped cool me off. I didn't check the temperature, but it was hot!Later: It got over 100 (F) today, and I'm glad I went walking this morning.Saturday. I left home about 8:15 am, when the temperature was in the mid 70s (F). I walked around the east loop and went to the corner and back. I felt fine during the east loop but got pretty tired during the extra distance, especially on the way back. I did, though, get the stroller on my front porch without help from others. I need to eat more for supper.The temperature should reach close to 100 (F) today. I just made it to 7+ miles for the week, thanks to the walk around Silver Lake."},

We left home about 1:30 pm for our walk, when the temperature was in the mid 50s (F). There was a gusty south breeze of about 10 mph during the gusts. The sun was out most of the time during my walk, and it felt really good when the sun wasn't behind the clouds. I had no jacket on, just a light shirt and my shorts. I also had compression socks on, up to my knees.I felt pretty good after my walk, but I need to do the the long walk several more times to get really used to the distance. My legs and body felt fine, but my arms got tired, and I stopped a couple of times for a few seconds to rest my arms. I put the break on my walker and stood while I rested my arms. I push the walker while I walk to help me keep my balance while I walk as fast as I can. My plans are to do the long walk two more times this week.Tuesday. Judy and I walked around the west loop, and then we walked to the Christensen's driveway for extra distance. We walked the whole thing without taking a break. The temperature while we walked was in the high 50s (F), but a strong south wind of about 20 mph was blowing. It is forecast to get colder as the day progresses. I felt pretty good at the end of our walk. My arms got a bit tired but not as tired as they did yesterday.Wednesday. Judy and I walked around the east block. Judy stopped walking and began working in her garden, and I continued walking to the corner and back. The sky was partly sunny, and the temperature during our walk was in the 50s (F) when we left home and probably in the 60s when I returned home. This was the same route and distances that we used on Monday, and I will walk the same route on Friday. I felt pretty good after completing my walk. The temperature didn't get colder as the day progressed, even though the forecast was different. My arms got a little tired, but they felt OK at the end of the walk.Thursday.  I walked the east loop and then went to the Christensen's driveway and back, while Judy was running errands. I didn't check the temperature, but it was hot!I went walking about 12:30 pm. There was no breeze blowing that I could detect. I felt fine after my walk, tired but not fatigued.  I took only one break (standing for 30 seconds) while doing the east loop, and a sitting break for 2-3 minutes before going to the Christensen's driveway and back.Friday. I walked the east loop and  then went to the corner and back for extra distance. The temperature during my walk was in the mid to high 70s (F). There was a slight north breeze blowing, but the breeze was stronger during my walk to the corner and back. I felt pretty good while walking the east loop, but I got very tired on the extra distance part, especially in my arms. Part of my tiredness came from the hot temperature that was in effect as I was walking. I left home about 10:50 am and walked in the heat of the day (from the skin-cancer viewpoint I should walk earlier in the day or later in the evening when it isn't so hot). I was glad for shade left by trees that covered part of my routeI spent several hours yesterday relearning how to use the timer for the sprinkling system. We now, with the longer garden hose that Judy bought, can water the whole yard without having to use the sprinkling heads. It takes Judy some time to move the hose and sprinkler around, but that is what Judy wanted to do. She uses secondary water instead of culinary water. I set it up so Judy has secondary water for eight hours each day, starting at 8:00 am. I can easily change the system to be for nine hours or more if Judy wants that much time (Judy later said she wanted secondary water for 12 hours). We are getting secondary water from one of the flower boxes on the south side of the house. I used one of the boxes for secondary water, because that box already had a connection for a garden hose. This saved me from having to buy a new sprinkler head that also allowed a garden hose to be connected.Saturday. I walked around the east loop and went extra distance by going up to the Christensen's driveway and back. I didn't check the temperature at the beginning and ending of my walk, but the sky was cloudy for the full walk. Judy worked in her garden and didn't walk with me. There was a gusty north breeze blowing with gusts of about 10 mph, but the gusts weren't very often.I felt pretty good during my walk, but I think I will do the same route and distances next week to get better adjusted to them. I broke into 5+ miles again this week."},

We left about 10:10 am and the temperature during our walk was in the mid to high 60s (F). There was a slight north breeze of 5 - 10 mph.I think I was tired this morning, because I didn't have much for supper last night. Quite a few years ago, we were told by a Park ranger in California that the energy for hiking during the morning came from the meal we had for supper last night. Little food for supper last night means little energy for walking this morning, and that is exactly what happened.Tuesday. I had a good supper and slept well last night. While Judy worked in her garden, I walked around the east loop and went to the Christensen's driveway for extra distance. I was a bit tired when I finished, but not as tired as I felt yesterday.

During the extra distance, I started to get tired, but I still felt pretty good, not nearly as tired as I felt a few days ago.There was a south wind of about 10-15 mph, so a cold front is moving in.

Probably not a heavy rain, but the kind that soaks in and doesn't damage plants, a good rain for us.I judge my age and health, and that of Judy, by the number of miles per week that we walk. We are currently doing heavy/light in our walking, and I try to keep our increases in distance to 10% or less. We're walking six days per weekThursday. Judy and I walked around the east loop, and I walked to the Christensen's driveway for extra distance. Judy walked about half of the extra distance, because she stopped to talk to a neighbor.

Judy did not go with me, because she is busy planting in her garden. She does a lot of back and forth walking, and bending over and standing upright. I did not check the temperature before or after I walked, but it is hot! I was glad for patches of shade caused by trees. No rain today, maybe tomorrow.I felt tired after my walk, but I am excited about tomorrow's walk, because I should break into 5+ miles for the week. Now 5 miles and then on to 6 miles in the future.Saturday.  I left for my rest walk about 9:30 am and went around the east loop plus up to the Christensen's driveway and back for extra distance. There was no breeze blowing and no rain. Yea! I made it to 5 miles per week. Before I go for 6 miles, I need to get used to the 5 mile distances. I was starting to get tired when I completed the east loop, and I wasn't sure I should go for the extra distance, but I made it OK. So, for a couple of weeks I'll keep the distance at 5 miles. Maybe for three weeks since I need a rest week during that time. I did not check the temperature, but was probably in the 60s (F).Judy didn't go with me, because she was working in her garden."},

I stopped to adjust my hat and a gust of wind caught me without a hold on my stroller. I fell forward into the stroller and regained my balance without going down. If the wind had been a south wind, I would have been blown backwards and gone to the ground, and probably to the hospital with broken bones (I had nothing behind me to break my fall). Fortunately, the wind blew me into the stroller, and I grabbed the stroller handles to regain my balance.I push the stroller as I walk to help me keep my balance. The number of miles shown in the titles to my posts is the number of miles that I have pushed the stroller in a given week.Thursday. Today I left for walking about 11pm. Judy did not go with me because she is getting an oil/filter change in our car. I walked around the east loop with a nice rest stop at the power box on Congressional. There was a slight north breeze. The temperature was very warm, probably in the 60s (F). I wore my winter coat, but I took the coat off after about 0.2 miles.Friday.  Judy and I walked the east loop and then walked to the corner and back, for a total distance of 1.025 for the day. We were outside about 11 am. The temperature was in the low 50s (F), and I wore my winter coat for the first part; I took the coat off after about 0.25 miles, and it was warm enough that I was comfortable in shirt-sleeves. There was a slight south breeze blowing of about 5-10 mph.Saturday. I walked around the east loop as a rest day. Judy did not go with me. The temperature was in the 60s (F), and it was nice to be out. There was a gusty south breeze of 10 or so mph blowing.I'm alternating heavy/light instead of the schedule I have previously discussed. Heavy is the east loop and then the corner and back. Light is just the east loop."},

Instead, I am thinking of going back to the Arctic Circle for more fish and chips. I really enjoyed the fish and chips we got yesterday. Judy, though, doesn't care for the fish. She likes chicken breasts and salads. I was raised on Halibut fish, along with mutton (my dad was a sheep man and killed old ewes for mutton which we ate at home and traded for food and other things at Dees, the neighborhood store). I like the flavor of Halibut. I like the flavor of mutton, too. Lamb is OK, but mutton has more flavor than lamb and is more delicious than lamb.My son, Chad, likes Steelhead fish. It is pink like Salmon but costs less. Ocean going Salmon is very expensive. Halibut is less expensive than salmon or steelhead fish but still good with french fries (chips)."},

So far this week we have accumulated 2.900 miles of walking.The temperature was about 30 (F) when we left home. There was no wind, and a few snow flakes fell on us while we walked. Those few flakes comprised the snow storm we were predicted to have.This afternoon. after making my last visit to the Wound Clinic at the Riverton Hospital, I went with Judy to the Costco store in South Jordan. Since there are no steps at Costco, I felt comfortable walking around the store. I used the shopping cart as a stabilizer for my balance. Judy parked a relatively short distance from the entrance to the store. and I walked from our car to the store and back to our car. It was nice to not be stuck in our car while Judy did the shopping at Costco.After leaving Costco, we got fish and chips at the drive-in window of the Arctic Circle on 27th West in South Jordan, and came home. I really enjoyed the fish and chips, although the chips are just french frys. I was raised on halibut and enjoy the flavor of the fish.Tomorrow is a rest day with no walking or running.

We had rain during the night and about two inches of snow fell this morning. However, the temperature was in the mid 30s, and the snow melted. The sidewalks were wet but free of snow, except for two places where there was slush on the sidewalk for about 10 feet.There was a north breeze blowing of about 3-5 mph.

{"title": " Today is a rest day", "date": "Friday, January 29, 2021", "text": "Today is a rest day. This means that today Judy or I do no walking or running at all (of course Judy and I do a certain amount of walking while doing daily activities to keep our house and yard in good shape). Judy and I have walked this week on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, and we will walk on Saturday (Sunday is also a rest day). This activity will have put a lot of stress on our bodies. Since this stress can lead to injuries, the purpose of a rest day is to allow our bodies to better adapt to our walking or running by giving our bodies an extra day without walking or running. The end result of all of this is that our bodies are subjected to less stress during the week and hence less likely to have injuries during the week.One problem to be addressed is the possibility of injuries occurring during the days we have walked or run. It is true that our bodies have been subjected to stress during the five days we will walk or run, so it is important that other procedures be performed during those days such that no injuries occur. Experience has shown that the walking or running will not cause injuries if the distance and severity of those walks or runs are kept low enough that injuries do not occur. The length of a walk or run on Wednesday is longer than the length of a walk or run on the other days. So, injuries might occur due to the walk or run on Wednesday. However, the walk or run on Wednesday is such that injuries do not occur.A walk or run on Saturday is longer than the walk or run on other days, and this increase in walking or running increases the stress on our bodies. Again, the increase in Saturday's walk or run is kept under control such that injuries do not occur due to the longer distance or faster walk or run on Saturday.If we look at ourselves for the whole week, we realize that the stress on a weekly basis will not cause injuries. It is true that the walk or run on Wednesday and Saturday causes greater stress than the other days, but the walk or run of the other days gives our bodies the days to reduce the over-all stress such that we are able to walk or run free of injuries at any time during the week. Rest days are also included to reduce the stress on our bodies.The running literature suggests that during one week per month less distance or speed be reduced such that our bodies are given the chance to walk or run with less stress on our bodies. The literature also suggests that every third or fourth month the monthly distance or speed be decreased to reduce the stress on our bodies.Another factor in walking or running is that increases in distance or speed are made with small increases rather than with large increases. This leads to the so-called 10% rule. It is easier on our bodies if we take several small steps rather than one large step. The literature also suggests that days of heavy (that is, normal) walking or running be followed by days of light (about half the distance or a heavy walk or run) walking or running. This due to the fact that it takes approximately 48 hours to recover from a heavy walk or run. This is known as \"heavy/light\" running or walking. I don't follow heavy/light running, because I follow the procedure of walking or running a medium and a long walk or run each week. When I did smaller distance or speed I did do heavy/light running. The important thing is that one does procedures to reduce stress."},

After spending the rest of 2019 and much of 2020 for my recovery via the Riverton Care Center and then home nursing, I am now going outside my house and walking several times per week. My speed has been reduced, because I don't have normal strength in my right leg and right shoulder, and because I am walking instead of running.  I don't have good balance,  and I use my walker when I am outside the house; the walker helps me keep my balance so I don't have more falls.My goal now is to reach the age of 100 and still be walking or running.  The distance and speed that I walk or run is not part of my goal.The titanium rods plus the pacemaker I had added to my body several years ago makes me a cyborg, as my son, Seth, would say. The titanium rods enable me to move around, while the pace maker keeps my heart pumping at a predetermined rate. The year 2020 is gone, it is past, history. We have begun a new year, the year 2021. I hope this year will bring the happiness that was missing last year.Today is Friday, and Fridays are my rest days. I won't go outside to walk, but I will move around the house.

He said to keep on doing what I have been doing. Dr. Allen runs marathons, and he said that as soon as I get single walks up to 5 miles, I should let him know  so he can go out with us. I'm wondering if he and I are distant relatives. I was named after my great grandmother, Martha Allen, and that is why I have a sir-name spelling of my name instead of the given-name spelling. Dr. Allen and I probably are not related, because \"Allen\" is a common sir-name. Since I have no more doctor's appointments this week, Judy and I decided to walk when it is warmer. We went walking about 2:15 pm, and the temperature was about 35 (F). We had about an inch of snow during the night, but the snow had mostly melted, and the sidewalks were wet but free of snow. The wind has changed from a south wind to a north wind, but the wind speed was about 2 MPH. Thus, the wind-chill was ignored. We had a tail wind going out and a head wind going home. We did the 0.6 miles that we have done during previous days this week. So far, we have done 2.4 miles this week.My appointment this week was with Dr. Eric Allen, my personal physician. He said I was in good shape. No liver, bladder, or blood problems, and that I should continue what I have been doing.

The total distance today was about 0.5 miles.I'm making a slight adjustment to the plan of walking given earlier. My week now consists of the following:Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday: a rest walk of about 0.4 miles, to the corner and back.Wednesday: a medium walk of about 0.62 miles, around my block one time.Saturday: a long walk of about 1.2 miles, around the block one time and around a different block one time.Friday and Sunday: rest days of no walking.The difference is that Thursday (today) was changed from a no-walking day to a rest walk.This plan gives a total of about 3.02 miles.  This distance will be increased once or twice a month. The basic idea of all of this is to make increases in distance small such that ones body can adjust without being injured. In the meantime, walking is done with lots of rest, such that the body is not injured.The two blocks that I go around are the blocks east and west and adjacent to the street I live on. The corner I go to during a medium or long walk is part of both the east and west blocks. On my long walk, after I reach the corner, I go left to do the block east and then go right to do the block west. The east and west blocks are  my long walk performed on Saturdays. On the medium walk, I do the east block but not the west block. On the rest walks, I reach the corner and then turn around and return home.I am still using my cane around my house or elsewhere, such as to church or to the temple. There is a certain rhythm to the proper use of a cane, and I'm getting used to the rhythm such that it is becoming a habit when I walk. The rhythm is proper when my walking is as if I wasn't using the cane.  Since it is my right leg that had the broken bone, I hold the cane with my left hand, and when I move the cane forward, I also move my right leg forward. That is, the cane holds me steady while I move my right leg forward. Then, I move my left leg forward and in front of the right leg. In this way, I move my two legs in normal walking, each leg going in front of the other leg. The cane hits the ground at the same time as my right leg (the one that had been damaged) hits the ground. Thus, I walk with my two legs and with the cane being used simultaneously with the damaged leg to give me stability while I move my damaged leg."},

{"title": "Weekly update: 175 minutes", "date": "Saturday, July 27, 2019", "text": "As I mentioned in an earlier post, this was a busy week and a week bad for jogging and walking. On Saturday, my wife and I went out about 9:30 am, but the heat was high. I carried three bottles of water and used it all (each bottle is 1 cup). I was sweating quite a lot, and the sweating was heavy, that is, more than normal. I also got a touch of dizziness during the latter part of my walks and jogs. That, plus my sweating, indicates I was starting to suffer from heat exhaustion. Fortunately, my exercise ended before heat stroke occurred. I've learned that I don't adapt to hot weather as much as I did when I was younger. When I was in my 60s and 70s, I could run in midday and extra water was enough to keep me going.  Now, I get heat exhaustion from the same temperature and humidity range.The heavy sweating and moments of dizziness, indicates that heat exhaustion was beginning to occur. My conclusion is that I need to continue to carry water, such that I have water left at the end of my walk/jog, and that I need to go out earlier in the morning or later in the evening to avoid the heat of midday. Doing a shorter distance during midday temperatures is also a good idea. So far, at least, this applies to my longer runs on Wednesday and Saturday, but not to my shorter runs on Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday. Time will tell if I get heat exhaustion on my shorter runs.After I arrived back home (Saturday), it was an hour before I felt normal. During that hour, I drank water and stayed indoors away from the heat.The images shown below are taken from without approval from the Internet. Heat exhaustion occurs first and leads to heat stroke. Heat stroke leads to death!"},

We were also out in the late-evening on the slow Friday walk (6th day),I carried 3 bottles of water on Wednesday, but I carried no water on Friday and Saturday. I got extra water from the fountain at the 100th South parking lot (at the beginning and end of each outing) on Wednesday and Saturday.The shorter walks on Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday are done near my home by going twice around the block each walk. The medium jog/walk is on Wednesday, and the long jog/walk is on Saturday, and both jog/walks are on the Jordan River Parkway; especially while coming back, I take short rest-stops on some of the benches along the path of the Parkway.All in all, it was a nice week!"},

I went out five times this week, and on my two longer jog/walks, I tried to go out earlier to catch the morning shade, because it is pretty hot during the day. I was glad for the water I carried on my two longer outings (Wednesday and Friday), but I only carried two bottles (1 cup each bottle) of water. The water fountain at the beginning and end of my outings gave me additional water (the fountain is in the 100th South parking lot).It is dangerous to run or walk in hot weather. The main problem is heat exhaustion, and that can lead to heat stroke, and that can lead to death! As long as one is sweating, he/she is probably OK, although the sweating should be normal for that exercise. Heavy sweating, which is sweating greater than normal, is one of the signs of heat exhaustion. But, if the sweating stops, stop your training and head for the nearest shade. Stop the exercise and get some water inside your body so sweating can begin again; otherwise, your body temperature will rise and rise and rise, until death occurs.In hot weather, run early in the morning while it is cooler. Be careful though, because heat exhaustion can occur early in the morning, too. The main thing is if you are sweating or not when you should be sweating. However, heavy sweating which is sweating greater than normal, is one of the signs of heat exhaustion, and that exhaustion may lead to heat stroke. Normal sweating is the body's way of cooling itself. Normal sweating is good. It may save your life!"},

I think that if I feel pretty good before I leave home, I will turn around at half of my goal for the day. However, if I feel tired as I did this morning, I will turn around at half of my goal minus 3 or 4 minutes or even 5 minutes. If I had done that this morning I would have come close to my goal for the day. Part of the reason I was tired this morning was that I mowed all of my lawns yesterday. I think I will mow my lawns on Wednesday instead of Friday so I will be more rested on Saturday for my long run.One woman, who was about 40 years of age, passed me (she was riding her bicycle) and then she turned around to check on me; she could tell I was pretty tired. I also look like an old guy, which of course is true; it is unusual for an old guy to be out walking and jogging in the middle of nowhere. I thanked the woman for checking on me. I was on my way back when the woman stopped me.

I did my long run by going to the Jordan River Parkway. I left the 100 South parking lot and went one mile south to the next \"tunnel\", at 106 South, and then returned to the 100 South parking lot.Years ago, when I finished my first marathon, there was a man who finished in the same time as me (a  few seconds faster than four hours). The only difference was that he was 83 years old and I was a middle aged man of 47. I am now 83 years old and I'm doing 5-7 miles per week instead of the 45-50 miles per week I did in my younger years. It all amounts to getting your body used to the longer distances, hence 45-50 miles per week, including at least one long run of 17-20 miles per week.If I were to train for a marathon, it would take me about two or three years to get up to 15 miles per week and another two or three years to get up to 30 miles per week, plus another year or two to get really used to the long distance. That is, it would take me about five or six years to get ready for a marathon. I would have to dedicate myself to this training, and I would probably have to curtail my church and family activities to have time for this training. Younger people may run a marathon with less training, but they may suffer afterwards for their relatively quick training.

I feel fine, and there was no pain during or after my walk.Pain is not an injury. It is a sign from ones body that he/she is doing too much, too long of a distance or too fast of a walk/jog. We humans in the USA speak English with nouns and verbs, and so forth. Our body, though doesn't speak English. It speaks another language with huffing/puffing, tiredness, pain, and injury as the primary indications of improper functioning. Huffing and puffing means more oxygen is needed for proper blood circulation. In response, we should take bigger breaths to get more oxygen in our bodies, or we should do less (in terms of distance or speed) to allow our bodies to perform well with the available oxygen. Tiredness means we are going too fast or too far for our body-condition. Pain is a sign from our body that injury is on its way, unless we slow down (in distance or speed) in our activity. Injury means our bodies aren't performing well. Our bodies have lost abilities to perform, and we are \"forced\" to slow down, usually by not running or walking at all. Learn to understand the language of our bodies, and listen to our bodies speak that language! Be injury free!!"},

When I was younger, I ran three times per week and changed the distance of all runs. After my runs reached 5 miles, I changed to the philosophy of rest runs, medium runs, and long runs. I've never run more that five times per week since I like to have rest days before and after my long run.I will use the distances given above for a while while my body adjusts to going out more often and to a longer weekly distance, Then, I will start increasing the distance of the medium and long walks.

My right ankle felt weak -- no pain just weakness.This weakness is similar to that felt when I first started running 42 years ago and was the reason I started running.  The weakness I felt then and now indicates weak muscles in my feet. The weakness is felt when I first start walking and goes away as I continue walking. This is known as the \"rusty gate\" syndrome. The gate is hard to push to start the opening, but after the gate starts moving, it moves more freely. In other words, the symptom of this weakness is that movement improves things. I am thus taking Rhus Tox to strengthen my muscles. This remedy was very helpful 42 years ago."},

From this viewpoint, it will take about six weeks for me to get used to the longer distance. I've completed one week, so five more weeks to go.My ear started bleeding this morning, shortly before I got out of bed. The nurse involved with my surgery had warned me that my ear might start bleeding, and that I was to put pressure on the ear to stop the bleeding. After about an hour the bleeding stopped, and I quit putting pressure on the ear. I had continued my use of the Eliquis blood thinner during and after the surgery, and that probably contributed to the bleeding.The ear has dried blood in it, but the big bandage absorbed most of the blood."},

I've had significant pain in my left foot, and it has taken this long to find out the cause and to reduce the pain. I went to the emergency room of the IHC hospital in Murray and found out that the blood circulation in my feet was OK. I then went to a podiatrist who wrapped my foot and leg with foam and an elastic tape. This wrapping was left on for a week and reduced the swelling in my foot and leg. The pain subsided and now I'm basically pain-free in my left foot. Apparently the pain was created by swelling in my foot and leg. Swelling is one of the side effects for the treatment for Prostate and bone cancer that I have. The pain in my left foot began at about the same time I was treated for cancer.Tonight, I went a relatively short distance, but the distance was enough for my current condition. I will do this distance two more times, and then I will increase the distance by about 10%. Even though I've been running for over 40 years and have completed four marathons, I've been away from exercise for such a long time that I'm basically starting over and will follow the Beginning Plan as outlined in my training blog at http://www.runninginjuryfree.org. Thus, my first goal is to walk for 30 minutes and then to do a bit of jogging in the middle of my walk. I will increase this jogging, while alternating jogging and walking until I'm doing 3 miles for my long run, 2 miles for my medium run, and 1 mile for my rest run. Rather than continuously running, I will alternate running (jogging) and walking with 50 seconds of running and 50 seconds of walking (a ratio of 50-seconds:50-seconds.

It is quite painful when I walk, although the pain seems to be subsiding. I don't know why the skin has been removed on the ulcer. It might be due to the compression stockings I've been wearing, and I've temporarily removed them for a few days."},

I like to go by distance when the distance is small and by time when the distance gets longer. The advantage of going by time rather than distance is if I feel fine I might go faster and get more distance in the time allocated. If I feel tired, I might go slower and get less distance in the time allocated, but I do my allotted time in either case.My goals now are as follows.Monday/Tuesday: Rest run of 1 hourWednesday/Thursday: Medium run of 1.5 hoursFriday/Saturday: Long run of 2.0 hoursThat will give me 4.5 hours of running weekly, corresponding to 6 or 7 miles of running. Instead of cycling between heavy and light runs, I am choosing and limiting the length of the runs on a weekly basis. I am still running 3 times per week.The times listed above are are pretty close to the times I've been running, although in the past I've gone by distance and used the heavy/light rotation of runs.I did my 1.5 hours, but I felt tired during the run. Not quite as tired as I was on Monday but still tired. I reached the bench which is 0.3 miles south of 106th South. There was a gusty headwind of 20-25 mph blowing from the south, and this wind made it difficult to go very fast on the way out. It was nice, though, to have the wind as a tailwind on the way back. Quite a few people were on the path today, especially cyclists. The temperature was in the mid 50s (F). I wore my nylon wind breaker (jacket) which protected me from the wind, although I took it off for the last quarter mile because I was getting too warm. After I got back home, I dozed in my car for half an hour before I went in the house.Tomorrow and Friday I will be in the hospital in Riverton getting scanned for Prostate cancer.

I think today was a great day for being outside. I wore enough layers to be warm during my run, and I protected myself from the rain by wearing a windbreaker and a hat. The secret of success is wearing what is needed for the conditions that exist."},

I wore my light running gloves, but my fingers still were cold. The rest of my body was fine, though. I saw several runners and walkers on the path and one skater. I was back at my car just before it became dark. When I was younger, my fingers would warm up after 1 1/2 miles, but they stayed cold during the last half of this run. I guess my blood circulation is not as good in my old body as it was when I was younger.One runner, whom I have never met, called me by my first name when he passed me, and I think he has been reading this blog.South Jordan City has a glass recycling bin at the parking lot, and my wife put several empty bottles in the bin, bottles that had held Martinelli non-alcoholic fruit juice.

{"title": "Another 2.4 mile heavy run", "date": "Wednesday, December 20, 2017", "text": "I just returned from my Wednesday heavy run and did another 2.4 miles. I didn't take any rest stops on the way out, but I took three brief stops on the way back. The temperature during my run was in the mid 50s (F), but the temperature should go down when snow arrives later this afternoon and this evening.I mentioned in my previous post that a new bench had been installed in place of the wooden bench that had been next to the path, about 0.18 miles north of 106th South. I discovered today that all of the benches have been replaced with the new metal ones. I'm concerned that the metal benches will be hot in the summer and cold in the winter. The old wooden benches, that had been constructed as part of Eagle Scout projects, probably required more maintenance than the new metal benches, due to water being absorbed by the wood, and maintenance costs may have been the motivating factor in the replacement of the benches. Also, the new benches have a back to them, which the wooden benches didn't have, and that is probably a plus, but the backs force people to face in a certain direction instead of giving people the choice of direction they face, and that is a minus in my view. Runners, walkers, and probably cyclists sit on the bench to get a brief rest and probably aren't interested in getting a view of the river. I am interested in facing the path, rather than the river, since that is where I run and walk, and I expect other runners, walkers, and cyclists have a similar attitude about facing the path. But, I don't make decisions about the benches, and I'm just glad the benches are there so I can take brief rest stops when I need such a rest.The following photos, taken from the web, show the Parkway path with an old bench next to the path (1st photo) and a new bench next to the path (2nd photo) , although the new benches that I saw have a South Jordan logo in the center of the back. The new bench shown in the 2nd photo doesn't have this logo; also, the new bench shown in the photo doesn't have arm-rests. For those interested, the following text was taken from Wikipedia.\"The Jordan River Parkway is an approximately 40-mile (64 km) urban park that runs along the Jordan River within the U.S. state of Utah. The parkway follows along the river from Utah Lake in Utah County, through Salt Lake County and onto the Great Salt Lake in Davis County. The majority of a mixed-use trail has been completed with a shared-use path for cyclists, skaters, and joggers. A separate equestrian path runs on the southern portion of the trail. Many trail-heads, city and county parks and golf courses are also located along the parkway.\""},

The snow flurries melted and there was little accumulation of snow on the ground. I used my jog:walk ratio of 80 seconds:60 seconds, as I've been doing on the Jordan River Parkway in recent weeks.While I was doing my 22 laps, a woman who was running quite a bit faster than I was going, slowed down for a few seconds and said it was wonderful to see me going around the track.

The sun was still higher than the Oquirrh  mountains, but there were long stretches of shade due to trees along the path. I wore a long-sleeved t-shirt (thick cotton) over my underwear, and I was cold for most of the run, but as I neared the parking lot on my way back, I felt warm since my body was generating enough heat that it overcame the cold temperatures. I had 3 layers over my torso and 2 layers on my arms and legs. My hands, though, were cold, because I didn't wear gloves or mittens. When I was younger, I didn't wear gloves or mittens until the temperature was about 15 degrees, but as I've gotten older, I've discovered that I need hand-warmers at higher temperatures. I guess I will wear gloves when the temperature during my run is in the 40s or below.The path was mostly bare of people, but I did see a couple of walkers/runners and several cyclists.In general, I don't wear cotton t-shirts, because cotton stops absorbing sweat after it gets damp, but in the winter time I do wear them. Cotton is a good insulator, if it is kept dry, and I don't sweat enough in cold weather such that sweat gets my t-shirts damp. Damp i-shirts and freezing weather don't mix, because the damp shirts freeze, and one ends up running with a big ice cube on his or her body. If I were running longer distances, I might not wear cotton t-shirts, because I would sweat more.Click the following image, which was taken from the Internet, for a larger view (look at the pictures and large text and don't try to read the small text). Be sure the last layer is a wind breaker to stop the wind. I use an uninsulated layer of nylon (in a jacket) for my last layer. The jacket stops any wind but provides no warmth. I depend on other layers to provide heat-control. I dress light such that I'm cold in the beginning but feel fine after about 2 miles of distance. Other runners have chosen to dress with more layers such they feel fine at first but are too warm later on. As I get older, I may switch to the other method of wearing layers."},

I also get tired cutting the limbs because the limbs are several inches in diameter and the cutting require a lot of arm movement.I cut one big limb and several small limbs before I left to go running, and that may have contributed to my dizziness.

{"title": "Sleep", "date": "Wednesday, August 09, 2017", "text": "Not getting enough sleep is a quick path to injury. Running and walking, as well as other forms of physical activity, increase the stress on ones body, and sleep helps our bodies adjust to and remove the stress.For various reasons, during the past month I've been getting 4-5 hours sleep at night. This is a reduction from the 7 hours of sleep that is my normal. I thought I'd explain my \"system\" for getting back to my normal of 7 hours of sleep. If I get my normal amount of sleep, I do fine, but I get tired and fall asleep during the evening when I get less than my normal. So, here is how I get back to my normal amount of sleep.1. I try and remove the factors that caused me to get less than my normal sleep.2. Even though I may wake up after 4 or 5 hours of sleep, I force myself to stay in bed until I've been in bed for 7 hours; I frequently add 1/2 hour to cover brief interruptions to my sleep, the result being that I'm in bed for 7 1/2 hours. During this time in bed, my bedroom light is off, and I keep my eyes closed and allow my body to go back to sleep. I also don't read or do other activities in my bedroom, so my body associates the bedroom with sleep.3. It usually takes about a week or two of forcing myself to stay in bed until I'm sleeping the whole time.We all have different bodies, and it is likely that you may need a different amount of sleep to get your normal sleep. It is also likely that your body may react differently to being in bed.The good news is that I'm almost back to my 7 hours of sleep. If you have suggestions that I (and others) might try, please leave your suggestions in comments to this post."},

Fresh snow is not slippery, but ice may be under the snow. A few years ago I was running on the Parkway path through a few inches of snow, and all of a sudden I found myself lying in the path. Ice had formed during the night and then snow covered the ice. I didn't break any bones, but I was sore for a few hours."},

I went to the South Jordan rec center and ran and walked 22 laps on the indoor track. Hopefully, the air inside the rec center is filtered and thus better than the outside air. An Orange day is mandatory regulation of smog-producing activities for those who are sensitive to bad air. As far as I know, I'm not sensitive to bad air, but since the rec center is available, and my health insurance reimburses the full cost of the center, I go there when the air is bad. 2.2 miles isn't quite far enough to get the 10,000 steps that are recommended by doctors, but I'm slowly increasing my distance. By the time I get to 3 miles, I will be getting my 10,000 steps.Here is a picture, taken from the web, that shows the bad air in Salt Lake City due to an inversion. I'm not in Salt Lake, but the bad air extends the full length of the Salt Lake valley. Inversions are caused when a layer of cold air is on top of warmer air, keeping the air in the warmer layer from going into space. The trapped air thus gets worse and worse. Snow is predicted for Thursday and Friday, and that should cause the inversion to disappear, although it will be back in a few days. Later in the Spring, the temperature will be warmer, and the inversions that caused the bad air will stay away until next winter."},

When I first saw them, they were going north, but when I saw them the second time, they had turned around and were going south.There were a lot of ducks on or near the path, but it looked like South Jordan had cleaned most of the duck poop from the path. Or, perhaps a heavy rain during the night washed the poop from the path. At any rate, it was nice to use a relatively clean path.I also saw a South Jordan maintenance truck on the side of the path.

However, they both were going much faster than I was going, and their speed probably helped to keep them warm. My nylon wind breaker (uninsulated jacket) did a great job of increasing the chill factor of the wind.The ducks, who use the path in the winter, don't have very good bathroom habits, and it was almost impossible to avoid their poop on the path.

The Salt Lake valley is a bowl with mountains on all sides of the valley, and we usually have poor air during the winter months. I haven't heard the official rating for the day, but I'm guessing the day was a yellow day, meaning there is smog, but it isn't life-threatening, i.e. use your judgment about going out.The following photo was taken from the web and shows the Salt Lake valley with serious smog.

I have a device that fits over my finger and measures the level of SPO2. I usually have about 91-92%, although I can get the number up to 95% or so when I take deep breaths. One reason I like running is that it automatically puts me into heavy-breathing that gives me more oxygen. During my cruise, I was at sea level, and the device gave readings of about 94-95% while breathing regularly, indicating I was getting about 2-4% more oxygen at the lower level of the cruise. The graph drawn by my TemnID device looks better (more regular) due to my pacemaker. I do though, once in a while, skip beats. I've known about this skipping of beats for over 30 years, and the heart-doctors don't seem concerned about it.I'm using the pointer finger of my left hand for these measurements.

We flew to Florida and then sailed through the old locks in the Panama canal to San Diego, CA, and then flew home. While in Florida, we visited the Epcot Center at Disney world and the Kennedy Space Center. We saw a rocket take off carrying a weather satellite. I walked around the ship a lot while were at sea, and I walked a lot during the land tours in five countries in Mexico, Central America, and one country in South America. I think I walked about 10 miles during the two weeks. The following picture shows the cruise ship (MS Veendam) docked at a Mexican port.The walking path on the ship is 1/13 of a mile, and I tried to walk 1/2 mile in the morning and 1/2 mile in the afternoon. On one of my walks, I was in a rain storm with 30 mph winds. I had sprayed my nylon jacket and pants with Silicone before I left, but the wind pushed the rain through the nylon and onto my clothes. But, the weather was warm and I wasn't in much danger of hypothermia. I pushed myself into a cold, because I violated the heavy/light principle of running by doing the mile every day. I didn't walk much for several days while I got rid of the cold, and then I walked the mile every other day and walked shorter days for the light portion of my walking. The following picture show the walking path around the ship. The next picture shows a view of the Panama canal from the ship. The lock gates are about 80 feet high. Water from a higher lock fills the next lock and is fed into the second lock via gravity. Several \"mules\" travel the tracks that go along the sides of the locks and are attached to each ship and guide the ship through the locks. The ships, however, use their own motors to move the ships; the \"mules\" do not pull the ships. There are two paths though the canal, and a container ship is in the lock behind us in the other path. We went through the older locks rather than the newer locks.Newer ships that are wider use the new locks."},

I felt pretty good at the end of the run. Going from 0.62 miles to 1.0 miles is a big jump, bigger than I usually make.

The temperature during my run (in the morning) was in the mid 60s (F), and it was a great day to be out!It was nice to be on the Parkway again. One advantage of not running around my neighborhood is that if I go out and back, I have no choice but to return all the way back. For today, for example, I turned around at 0.5 miles and had no choice but to go 0.5 miles back to my car. If I'd gotten tired on the way back, I would have walked the remaining distance, but I still had to go 0.5 miles back. If I run around my neighborhood doing shorter loops, if I get tired, I can abort the run and go home, thus doing less distance on the way back. Of course, if I get really tired, I may be happy to abort the run. One \"problem\" that I'm encountering is that I feel fine when I reach the turnaround point but get tired on the way back, and I have no choice but to walk back to my car.

I do remember, though, tripping on the sidewalk when I was younger, so accidents can happen at any age. One time in Massachusetts I started a run, and my feet got tangled in a bunch of coat hangers that were on the road, and I went down and skinned my knee.

I get up to 2 miles or so, and then something happens to cause me to cut my distance to 1/2 mile or so. Oh well, I'm jogging and walking for enjoyment, and I do what I can in my old age."},

The dizziness wasn't the dizziness I felt when my heart stopped beating; it was the dizziness I've felt for a couple of years when I'm in the dark or my eyes are shut. After we finished talking, we continued our walk. I felt off-balance and turned around and went home. We were out in the evening after dark, and I lose my balance when it is dark or when I close my eyes during the day. I think I'll use my cane when we go out in the evening after the sun is down."},

For younger runners, rest-weeks are usually about half of a normal week. For us older runners, rest-weeks are what ever is needed to recharge ones body.While I was resting on a bench on the way back, a walker in her mid 60s stopped and talked with me. She has seen me several times on the Parkway path, and she wondered how old I am. She was amazed that I'm still running. Her mother, who is about my age, walks the path, but she uses a walker.

Assuming one left-leg step is one second is pretty close for walking, but I need about 97 left-leg steps when jogging for 80 seconds. The result of this is that what I've called 80 seconds in the past is actually less than 80 seconds, and I need to add about 17 left-leg steps to get to 80 seconds.Today, I jogged for 80 seconds (using the timer) or about 97 left-leg steps for my jogging. That is a big increase. I also added to my distance so I could reach the bench that is south of 106th South. I did all of this without carrying water, and the shade temperature when I returned home was 91 (F). I got pretty tired on the way back and walked most of the last 3/4 mile. I walked, because I got dizzy if I jogged. I should have refrained from adding to my distance such that my body could adjust to the larger number of left-leg steps in my jogging phase. And, I should have carried water. Oh, well, I made it back to my car. When I go out running on Wednesday, I'll carry water.

One side effect of Warfarin is the discoloring of ones calves and feet. I was told by a doctor that the discoloring would be permanent, and I think she is right. I've been off Warfarin for several years, but my calves are still discolored, and the discoloring has not changed. I was taken off Warfarin when I had no new clots, but the clots returned and I'm currently on Eliquis as a blood thinner. Actually, these meds don't affect the density of the blood and hence aren't a blood thinner, even though they are called that. These meds affect the ability of the blood to coagulate."},

I told them it was a natural thing for people using Warfarin for blood clots but that I had stopped Warfarin and was on Eliquis which doesn't discolor ones legs. They were surprised when I told them, in answer to a question, that I was 81 (well, I'm really 80, but I'm closer to 81 than I am to 80). They thought I was in my mid 70s.

Last week I talked with a man who was feeding the two cats that I've seen in the past. He said the cats are both female and were born near the path. The cats aren't feral (wild) and they weren't turned loose by someone. They are just outdoor cats."},

The sun was shining during my run and afterwards. However, I fell asleep, and when I awoke the sky was overcast and there was thunder. I knew that rain was coming, so I did the lawn as fast as I could. I finished the last half of the back yard in the rain. I was soaked when I finished, but I did finish the lawn. I put the mower away and came inside to dry out.Yesterday I was taking care of a grandchild for a couple of hours. We walked about a mile round trip to look at a nearby canal to see if the canal had water. It did, and we saw several ducks in the canal. The canals usually get water during the 1st or 2nd week in May and keep the water until the middle of October. One of the ducks was a mother with 7 ducklings following her.

I did an additional 60 seconds of walking, and the knee then felt fine. I continued alternating jogging and walking. Later my right ankle felt weak, and I did an additional 60 seconds of walking. Both the tightening of my left knee and the weak feeling in my right ankle were, I believe, indications that my body wasn't fully warmed up. It takes about 2 miles to warm up, and I had gone only about a mile. The extra time for walking gave my body additional time to warm up.When I reached the bench at the turn-around point I had used last week, my body and legs felt fine, so I continued down the path to a new turn-around point that I had selected. However, after I had turned around and was approaching the bench that was my turn-around point last week, I started to feel tired.

I also saw two feral or stray cats, one a black cat and one a Persian cat. They were on the path going down and coming back. The same cats (or two of the same colors) were loose last fall, and I'm wondering if they spent the winter outside.

Burglars may get in the house, but once inside they will quickly wish they were some where else.My daughter has been doing some walking, but she recently complained of pain in the front part of her lower leg. That area is known as the \"shin\" and pain there, known as shin splints, is a common problem with walkers and runners. Shin splints are an \"over use\" injury, meaning that the shin muscles aren't used to the amount of stress they are given. I told my daughter to do \"furniture lifts\" to help strengthen the shin muscles. I hope she will do those or similar stretches to strengthen her muscles. If she doesn't, the pain might get worse and lead to a more serious injury. Furniture lift stretches are described in my training blog at http://runninginjuryfree.org Walkers tend to not do stretches, because they believe their walking won't cause problems with their muscles. However, they are wrong in thinking this, because any activity causes stress, and stress leads to pain, and pain leads to injury. Stretch exercises reduce the tension and strengthen the muscles.My knee felt fine when I started my jog and walk, but it felt stiff during the run. I reduced my jogging to 30 seconds at a time, and the knee felt fine. I had been doing 40 seconds. There was a light, very light, sprinkle during my run, but as soon as I started my drive home, the rain came down in a big pour.

Being older, I don't have as much energy, and I'm letting my body focus on getting rid of the cold instead of moving me another mile or two.

I don't consider this stress a serious injury, because the knee improved in three or four days. However, I've been thinking about my future running, and here is my plan for that.1. I'm going to be more diligent in stretching before or after I run/walk. I ran for 40 years with no injuries, because I stretched regularly and my body adjusted to the running. In recent months, I haven't stretched much, although I was stretching (but not enough) when my left knee reacted to the stress.2. I'm going to start with a distance of half a mile and increase my distance every week or so by about 10%. This will, I hope, allow my body to adjust to the running and become stronger. When I was younger, my body adjusted more quickly, but now that I'm older, my body needs more  time for adjustment.3. I've been using a run/walk ratio of 60 seconds walking and 40 seconds running (actually more of a jog). That ratio seems good for my body, and I plan on keeping it.4. I've been running/walking 2 to 3 times per week, and I plan on keeping that. Time will tell if this plan works for me. The key to running without injuries is to keep the stress level below that which can be handled by ones body. Keeping the stress level low implies keeping the distance and pace below that which would cause injuries, and keeping increases in distance or pace to 10% or less. Also involved is recognition that ones body needs at least 48 hours of reduced stress between bouts of increased stress, thus the limit of running and walking to 2 to 3 times per week."},

When I was younger and was in marathon training, I could take a week off from running and not notice much difference in my body condition. However, now that I'm older I do notice a difference.

The temperature was in the high 20s (F), and a slight north wind was blowing. I wore 3 layers, and my body felt fine, but my fingers were cold. When I was in marathon training, it would take about a mile and a half for my body to warm up. Now that I'm older and am walking as well as jogging, it takes longer for my body to warm up. The pain in my fingers was just beginning to subside when I got back to my car, even though I had cotton gloves that provided protection against the cold.This picture, taken from the web, shows fingers that have frostbite and are thus white due to poor blood circulation. My fingers were cold today but did not have frostbite. However, I have a pair of heavy mittens that would keep my hands warm, but I haven't been using them during my running due to their weight. I'm going slow enough that the weight of gloves shouldn't be a concern, and I think I will use those mittens on my next run if the temperature is in the 20s or below. The mittens have about 1/4 inch of wool with a nylon shell.I used to do a lot of winter camping as Scoutmaster, and I only remember one time when two or three of my scouts had problems with frostbite. I taught them to check their faces and hands often for frostbite and to check their toes when they first got up, the symptom being small white spots on their hands and feet that indicated frostbite was beginning to occur. One morning after we got up, a couple of the scouts had small white spots on their toes. My car was nearby, and I took the affected scouts to the car and used the car heater to warm them up. I had taught the scouts to use hand warmers in their sleeping bags to keep their feet safe while they were sleeping, and most of the boys were OK."},

Using time instead of distance is easier than actual distance since I just have to look at my watch when I began and exercise for an hour. The last time I used the rec center, I had to count laps, and I frequently forgot how many laps I had done. The outside temperature was in the low 30s, but it felt cold. The rec center was cool but felt fine after my body warmed up.I would have liked to go to the Jordan River Parkway, but it was quite cold outside and I wasn't sure the Parkway path would free from ice. When I was younger, I would have gone to the Parkway, but I'm older now and less interested in \"braving the elements\", and I have my wife's feelings about this matter to consider.

I added 5 seconds to my walking and running, giving me 40 seconds running and 60 seconds walking. While I'm getting used to the total time, as mentioned above, I will also be getting used to the longer phases of running and walking. It's good for runners, especially older runners like me, to make small changes in distance and/or pace so our bodies can get used to the higher levels of activity.I've been careless in not stretching very much before and after I run.

She walked 2.9 miles and I ran/walked 2.8 miles. The temperature was in the mid 30s (F), not much sun, and there were south-wind gusts of 15-25 mph. It was nice having the gusts push me on the way back. I made the distance with no rest stops.My distance is long enough that I need to change from distance to time. My weekly goals for time are 1 hour, 1.33 hours, and 1.66 hours, representing a rest run, a medium run, and a long run. It takes me about an hour to do the 2.8 miles, so I think I'm ready to start using time instead of distance. The advantage of time is that for the same time, the distance covered varies according to how the runner feels, and this change is automatic. I'll start using time and then increase the mid and long runs a bit as I get stronger, until I reach my goal for the three times. I'll keep the rest run the same time as today. I run 3 times per week, and that allows me to do all three times each week.I've been running 30 seconds and walking 50 seconds, but I changed to 35 seconds and 55 seconds earlier this week. These changes are small, especially for younger runners, but they work fine for older runners like me. I like Jeff Galloway's run/walk method. It allows me to go further than I would go if I did no walking. When I was younger, though, I would do only running. I later learned about the run/walk method and changed to it."},

I'm using a broad-leaf spray.  I would prefer to not spray, but I haven't found a good way to control weeks without using chemicals.

The temperature was in the low 60s (F), but it felt colder due to high humidity and a wind of about 5 mph. I didn't notice the wind on my way out, because it was a tail wind, but as soon as I turned around, I felt the wind, which was now a head wind. I was glad to get back to my car since I was mostly walking, and walking doesn't do much to generate heat. During the hot summer, I will be glad for all the walking I'm doing, but on cold days, like today, I kinda wish I was running more so I would keep warm. Today I dressed like I was running most of the time when in reality I was walking most of the time.The following picture was taken from the web."},

One the way back, I stopped and added 2 seconds to my running, giving a run/walk ratio of 17 seconds/40 seconds. Two seconds doesn't seem like much of an increase, but it helps compensate for the time lost in the transition from running to walking and walking to running. The temperature during my run was in the high 60s (F), and on the way back there was a head wind of 5-10 mph. All in all, it was a nice day today. Sunny but large clouds in the sky."},

The temperature was in the low 60s (F), and it was a nice day for running. I wore my running shorts for the first time since last Fall. I changed my run/walk ratio to 15 seconds running or jogging and 40 seconds walking. This means I'm changing my run/walk ratio to do less running. It seems to work fine. I completed the distance with no rest breaks, and I felt fine at the end. As I get older, I'm doing more walking and less running and will probably do all walking at some point in the future.I'm glad its OK to be a slow poke, because I certainly am one. It's OK, though, because I enjoy myself and that is what counts."},

I took no rest breaks. After I finished, I stopped at a grocery store for a few minutes, and it was dark when I left the store. There weren't many people on the path, probably because of the late hour. Even though I wore long pants and three layers, I was cold during the run and had just begun to get warm when the run was over. Coming back, I had a slight head-wind of about 2 mph. Not much of a wind but enough to reduce the wind-chill a degree or two. When I was younger I would have run in running shorts and two layers on my upper body. Now, I run in long pants and three layers. It's different running as an old man, but listening to ones body is the key to success at any age."},

When paced correctly, running delivers the best attitude boost you can get. Sustain this by pacing yourself gently during the first mile or three.A well-paced run enhances vitality for the rest of the day.  Start each run at least 30 seconds a mile slower than you will run at the end.If you  have a Run Walk Run strategy that is right for you on that day, it's  possible to feel good after every run-even the marathon.Running is  the best stress reliever I've found. Research shows that running tends  to activate the conscious brain which over-rides the emotional  subconscious brain and manages the negative and anxiety hormones during  and after the run.Research shows that as runners get faster, their stride length shortens.  A quicker cadence is the mechanical key to faster running.The  finishing of a run that is longer than you've run in the last 3 weeks  can bestow a sense of achievement that is unique and empowering-due to  positive brain circuits that are turned on.You can't run a long run too slowly or take too many walk breaks.  You'll get the same endurance based upon the distance covered."},

There were quite a few folks on the trail. Three guys flew by me on their bikes, and the lead one yelled back at me \"You motivate me, you motivate me, you motivate me\". I replied, \"But I'm not as fast as you\", although he likely didn't hear me because he was going much faster than I was. I took two rest stops of about a minute each on the way down and three stops on the way back. On my last stop, I heard a man talking loud. He was off the trail in some trees, and I couldn't tell what he was saying. After I completed my run, I was sitting in my car eating a protein bar, and two police cars came into the parking lot. One policeman came to my car and asked if I had heard somebody yelling. I told him about the loud voice I heard from the trees.

Of course, since today was a work-day for many people, most of the people we saw were stay-at-home moms, young kids, and older persons. I forgot to bring my run/walk timer, so I estimated each phase."},

The closest parking to the tunnel is the driving range on 90th South. We continued running and walking through the tunnel and went north on the Jordan River Parkway until we reached the one-mile mark, and then we returned to our car at the golf course. I didn't start my GPS until we had gone about 1/4 mile, and that accounts for the extra 1/2 mile that I show in the title to this post.

The apples are small this year, so we each took 3 of them. When we reached the Sandy golf course, we went north instead of east.  West Jordan has built a new tunnel under 90th South, but we turned around before we reached it. In order to reach the tunnel, we need to get our distance up to 3-4 miles.I felt stronger today and did better in my running and walking. When I returned (2.6 miles), I felt about the same as I did last week after 1.8 or 1.9 miles. I'm doing well in getting 7 hours of sleep each night, and that extra sleep helps me increase my distance.The following map of the trail, showing the routes I usually run, is from the web. The map is old and shows the detour at the Sandy  (River Oaks) golf course to the light at 7th West and 90th South and then along 7th West until it goes back to the Jordan River. The trailhead, where I usually park, at 100th South, is slightly above the head of the bird and about 1.3 inches to the right of the head of the bird. It is marked Shields Lane Trailhead, although that is hard to read because of the small size of the map. Click the image for a larger and more readable view. If I go south, I'll reach the tunnel under 106th South (shown on the map as the South Jordan Parkway).

{"title": "Ran two miles but was tired", "date": "Wednesday, September 10, 2014", "text": "I woke up Wednesday morning and felt pretty good. I dressed for running and hoped my body was recovered from mowing my lawns yesterday. Last week I changed my running/walking ratio from 20 seconds each to 15 seconds each. The reason for the change was to prevent my body from getting quite so tired while I mowed my lawn.My wife and I drove to the 100th South trail head of the Jordan River Parkway and went north. I felt pretty good when I started, but by the time I reached my turnaround point (1 mile) I was starting to get tired. I walked the last half mile and visited with my wife as we talked. I guess my body wasn't as recovered as I thought. But, running or walking, When I mowed my lawn on Tuesday, my body got really tired, and I had to take several rest stops to finish the mowing, But, when I ran on Wednesday, it was my feet that got tired rather than my body. Sometimes when I run, it's my feet that limit my distance. Other times it's my body, and sometimes it's both. I'm just glad I went out Wednesday and moved my body. Walking is actually safer than running, because the jolts to ones body are smaller, and the resulting injury rate for walking is less than for running. There is a tendency for runners to look down on walkers, when it really should be the other way around. I view walkers as my brothers and sisters in exercise, and I recommend that people do what they really enjoy, whether it's running, walking, cycling, skating, swimming, hiking, chasing grand kids, dancing, or what ever. Keep that body moving and enjoy it!The following cartoon of a guy mowing his lawn was taken from the web."},

The sun was still above the Oquirrh Mountains when we began, but it was below the mountains when we finished. Even though the sun was down, we had plenty of light to see the trail.

I noticed, in the parking lot, a SUV that was pulling a large trailer.  There was a four-wheel hand wagon parked next to the trailer. As soon as I got on the Parkway path, I saw a film crew shooting film of a runner. The runner would run about 100 feet and then the shooting would stop. I heard the director's voice say something, and the runner repeated his run for another shot. This happened several times before I continued my run. When I returned from my 2 miles, the file crew and their SUV and its trailer were gone.I felt pretty good during my run, although I did take three brief rest stops (one on the way out and two on the way back). It's amazing how one feels after a 45-second rest stop. I've been using a run/walk ratio of 40 seconds each. I thought I'd try a shorter ratio and changed my timer for 15 seconds each. I'll use that ratio for several runs to get a good idea of the effect on my body of shorter runs and walks. My initial impression, though, is positive. After 15 seconds of running, my body still feels fine, and I take a 15 second walk to help my body recover. Thus, I never felt tired during my run. There were quite a few cyclists, walkers, and runners using the trail. Before my run, I started my stretches, and the sun hadn't come over the Wasatch Mountains, but by the time I finished my stretches and backed my car out of my garage, the sun was up. I love the Fall time of year. Cooler temperatures, dry air, and very pleasant being outside.On my way back, I saw two deer go across the path and disappear into the trees. Neither deer had antlers. One deer was larger than the other deer, so they may have been a doe and her faun. The Jordan River is shallow, and the deer had crossed the river to see if the \"grass\" is greener on the other side of the river. It's been a couple of years since I last saw deer in this vicinity. The last time I saw a deer in the river, he was just standing there looking at me. The river looked to be about 2 feet deep at that point.  During the winter, a lot of deer come down from the mountains looking for foodMy wife didn't come with me this morning, because she wanted to be home when our granddaughter came to spend the day with us. My granddaughter was there when I returned, so it was good that my wife was there to greet her.The following picture was taken from the web."},

With a headwind of about 5-7 mph and a cloudy sky, it was a great day for running. The temperature was in the mid 70s (F), and the headwind  kept my body relatively cool. However, when I reached the one-mile marker and turned around, the wind had died down, and I began to heat up. I decided it wasn't quite so nice, after all. My body felt fine, but my legs got a bit tired. I felt, however, much better than I did the last time I ran 2 miles. The big test will be on Monday. It's common for my first run to be good after I've been off for a while, but the second or third run usually isn't so good.I found three golf balls along the path. One ball belonged to the golf course, and I threw it back onto the nearby green (golf course balls have a particular marking that privately owned balls don't have). The other two balls were privately owned, and I kept them, washing the dirt from them in the water fountain when I returned to the parking lot. I don't know why I'm collecting the balls. Originally, I thought my grandson would be interested in selling the balls, but he didn't show any interest in them. I continued collecting them and am still doing it, although I'm not putting in much effort to getting them. If I see one as I run, I'll pick it up. Other wise, I leave the balls that are away from the path for others to get.I saw a few quail along the path. These were individual birds and not in a flock with their mother. I couldn't tell if they were a parent of a spring-flock or a member of the flock. The babies in the spring are now almost fully grown and are as big as their parents."},
{"title": "Review of the past 10 days", "date": "Friday, August 29, 2014", "text": "Last week, my wife and I were in Provo attending a non-credit Education Week at Brigham Young University. We left home about 7 am and returned around 10:30 pm. I did no running during the week, but I did walk about 3 miles. It was a stressful week, but the classes were nice. My favorite classes were on archeology and the life of Christ. Archeologists are learning about the architecture of the Temple Block in Jerusalem and the lives of typical Jewish people in Galilee and Judah that likely applies to Christ. For example, the Jewish temple was built on Mt. Moriah, and the wall around the temple was built with a taper to compensate for the decline of the hill, giving level ground around the temple. This area was known as the Temple Mount. Many of the activities of Christ, such as the cleansing of the temple were in the Temple Mount not in the Temple itself. Money changers were at the Temple Mount to exchange the coins used by common folk into the special gold coins used in the Temple Mount. The Temple priests, who were wealthy, were involved with the money changers, and Christ was upset with them, because they charged extra for the exchange of coins and used that money to pay for their expensive homes in the \"upper\" part of Jerusalem. Another class that I enjoyed was on the writing of personal histories, making the stories seem real-life to the readers so they want to keep reading, so the readers react as if they were there. I'm currently writing my personal history, and I need to review what I've written and see if I can fine-tune the stories.Two of our grandchildren attended Education Week with us.This week has been mostly a no-running week. My daughter and her family are in Germany and France for a year doing research for two books, and my wife and I spent significant time at her house doing a few things that weren't done to make the house ready for new renters who will move in at the end of this month. We didn't do any running, but we walked around the block (0.67 mile) on Tuesday. I'm hoping to go running on Saturday (tomorrow).We've had rain almost every day with lightning strikes. More of that forecast for tomorrow. Not great weather for running. Life is stressful sometimes, and one does whatever is necessary.

Spring and Fall are times to improve performance.The first sign of heat exhaustion that I usually get is a headache. I didn't have that symptom today. Another sign of heat exhaustion that can lead to heat stroke is a lack of sweating. Sweating is the way our bodies regulate temperature, and if we stop sweating our internal temperature starts to climb. I wasn't aware I was sweating less during my run, but at the end of the run I got a good drink of water, and sweat started pouring down my face.Because of the shortness of my run, I didn't carry water, but I should carry water when ever the temperature goes above 90. I need about 1 cup of water per mile, so I should have carried two bottles of water (1 cup each) in my Fuel Belt. Hopefully, I'll get used to the heat (to a degree at least), but in the meantime it would be good for me to run earlier in the morning."},

The geese were under the bridge over 104th South where it is shady. Maybe the geese were seeking shade to avoid the heat of the day.On the way home, I was thinking about my history of running. Five miles used to be a rest run; now it is a long run. 1.5 miles used to be my warmup distance; now it is my total distance. Such is life and getting old.

The path isn't hard to follow in the dark, because the asphalt is a lighter shade of gray than the surrounding vegetation.  Also, there are lights from near-by buildings that help to lighten the night.I didn't run last Saturday, because on Friday we played miniature golf with several grandchildren. I didn't do a lot of distance (maybe a quarter mile), but I was on my feet for two hours.

I changed, because 20 seconds seemed a bit short for my current condition. Running 30 seconds and then walking 30 seconds seemed \"about right\" for my current condition. Each person has to find out for himself or herself the ratio to be used. When I first started using walk-breaks, I walked for 1 minute each mile. Later, I changed to 30 seconds each half mile. As I got older, I found that I needed to walk more and run less, and I've experimented with various ratios. One ratio that I like a lot is 1 minute:1 minute.The temperature during my workout was in the mid 70s. I was out in the early evening, and the temperature was going down as the sun went behind the Oquirrh mountains. During the past week, the temperature has been in the 90s (F).

However, by the time my wife and I went out, the sky was only partly cloudy and the temperature was nice and comfortable. I think I will do 1.5 miles again next week; I'm not ready for an increase.I've been thinking about my abilities as a runner as I've gotten older. When I was in my mid 40s, I ran four marathons, the times ranging from 3:59 to about 4:12. I ran weekly long runs of 15 miles, at a 7 minutes/mile pace. I could work in my yard all day and then run 15 miles in the evening. After I stopped running marathons, I began a slow downward slide in my distance, but I maintained a long run of about 10 miles. In May 2004 (age 69) my wife and I were in a serious automobile accident. I was in intensive care for three weeks, much of the time in an induced coma. Twice my family was called in, because the doctors didn't think I would make it through the night. I did make it, though. The night before I left that hospital to go another hospital for physical therapy, the technicians got me on my feet, and I was able to support my body weight for about three seconds, and then I had to sit down. During 10 days of therapy, I learned to walk again, first using a wheel chair, then a walker, then a cane, and finally without any support, although I had to use a banister and pull myself upwards when going up stairs. During the first year after my accident, I had my gall bladder removed, surgery for a double hernia, and surgery for 10 skin cancers (one skin cancer required surgery 1/4 inch deep and about 1.5 inches in diameter.I had good running for four years. In 2006 and 2007, I ran half marathons and had hopes of working up to a full marathon. However, in January, 2009, my running came to an abrupt end, literally. I finished a 22-mile week with a 7-mile run on Saturday. On Monday, I could only walk about 100 feet. I was in the hospital for 5 days, while doctors tried to find out what was wrong with me. It took several months for the doctors to discover that the problem was a vein-filter that had  been placed in me during the three weeks I was in intensive care but was not removed when I went into 10 days of therapy. The filter had quit working and blocked most of the blood returning from my two legs to my heart. I had blood clots during this time, but none of the clots reached my lungs, thankfully. During the months following my hospital stay, I ran short distances, and my strength and distance slowly came back as my body created new veins around the filter.By this time, I was in my mid 70s, and I was beginning to suffer the effects of getting older. Now, I'm almost 79. My balance and coordination are going down. My mind and memory are still good, though. I'm running short distances at a slow pace, and I'm using Galloway's run-walk-run method of alternating running and walking. Am I sad that I'm running slow and short distances rather than the half and full marathons I would like to be running? No, I'm still alive and am enjoying my running. I take life as it comes and try to make the best of each day. I'm currently serving a service mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, giving 10 hours or more each week to my missionary calling, answering feedbacks from users of an app called Gospel Library (the app runs on iPod, iPhone, iPad, and Android, although I'm not involved with the Android version). I still have hopes of running and walking until I reach age 100, and if that happens, I'll keep running and walking as long as I can. My heart is strong, and my upper body is relatively strong. If I reach the point where I can't run or walk, I'll let a wheel chair be my legs and keep on going. Life has been good to me, and I'm trying to be good to it."},

As I've explained in past posts, my swelling came right after I started taking a new OTC remedy for joint stiffness. I'm not completely sure if the OTC remedy was causal or not, but I don't think running was causal. What ever the reason, I'm glad to see the swelling go down.The following picture (taken shows what my legs looked like, although my left leg wasn't swollen quite as much as the leg in the picture.

{"title": "Ran 1 mile on Jordan River Parkway", "date": "Saturday, May 03, 2014", "text": "About two months ago, my left leg swelled. My right leg was fine. It happened concurrently with my taking a new OTC remedy for joint-stiffness. I stopped the remedy, but the swelling didn't go away.  I don't think the swelling was due to a running injury because there was no soreness or pain of any kind. My activities weren't limited. I decided to not run for a while to see if the swelling would go down. During this time while I wasn't running, I had a lot of activity walking around the yard and with my grand kids around the block, so I was getting aerobic activity of some kind. The swelling finally went down, although it isn't quite gone away, and I'm back to running. I'm limiting my distance today to give my body a chance to adjust to the running.I'm glad I only went 1 mile today, because I was tired when I finished. When I was younger and stronger, it would take me about as long to come back from a layoff as I was off (a one-week layoff followed by a one-week recovery, for example). Now that I'm much older, and not nearly as strong, it is likely taking longer for a recovery than I was off. Being off a month probably means that I'll need two months for recovery. This means that May and June will be recovery months, and I can look forward to July as a continuation of my 3-mile long runs. This means that I can add 2 miles to my long run during the two-month recovery. This translates to about 1/4 mile per week. After one month of recovery, I'll freeze my Monday run at two miles, and this will be my rest-run. After two more weeks, I'll be up to 2.5 miles, and I'll freeze my medium run at that point. After another two weeks, my long run will be at 3 miles, my medium run at 2.5 miles, and my rest run at 2 miles. This looks good on paper; time will tell if it is good in real life. I make goals and form a plan, but often my body thinks differently than my brain, and my body always wins out.I've been doing Galloway's run-walk-run method of alternating running and walking. I've been doing 1 minute of running and 1 minute of walking. I read via tweeter that Galloway and his wife had completed a marathon using a ratio of 15 seconds running and 15 seconds walking, and I thought I would try that ratio. I will need to use the new ratio for several workouts before I make a decision about it. It seemed OK today. I think I'll try 20 second cycles next week. Experienced runners won't need to use run-walk-run, because they are likely used to running long distances, but the method is good for beginner runners and older runners, like me, who have bodies not as strong as the experienced runners."},

Going out early was nice, because there were rain showers later in the day, although the showers were intermittent and light.This week is a good example of what I want to do for the next month: 2 miles as a rest run. 2.5 miles as a medium run, and 3 miles as a long run. Doing those distances will help my body get used to the longer distance of 3 miles. When I feel like my body has adjusted to those distances, I will increase by 5-10% the distances of all three runs. After each increase, I will run the new distance for at least a week or two. When my rest run gets up to 3 miles, I'll switch to using time instead of distance to report each workout.

Lots of people were out enjoying themselves.Today was my last run in my PI iZUMI shoes. They've served me well for 500 miles, and I'm retiring them to be my walking shoes, and for the next 400 miles I'll be running in my LOCO Carumba shoes. I have one more pair of Carumbas to use after my current ones reach 500 miles (they're currently at 112 miles). So, 900 miles from now, I'll be shopping for new shoes, since LOCO shoes aren't sold anymore. I used to run 900 miles in less than a year, but now, with my age, I'll probably take 3 years for that many miles."},

{"title": "Back into running with 2 miles today", "date": "Thursday, March 06, 2014", "text": "I mentioned in my February 26 post that I was experimenting with a new supplement that is supposed to give me greater energy. The supplement contains two enzymes that are used by our bodies in the generation of energy. I began with the recommended dose of two capsules per day and discovered that my left leg swelled and I had some minor pain just above the knee. I discontinued the supplement for a few days while the swelling  subsided. Then, I tried one capsule per day and found that my left leg swelled again and was sore again. I discontinued the supplement and haven't run during the past week. This morning, the swelling and soreness were gone, and my wife and I went to the Jordan River Parkway and went south from the 100th South parking lot. We each did 2 miles.There are showers forecast for this afternoon, after 3 pm, with a 40+% chance of rain. We left home about 1 pm so we would be back home before the showers. We just got back and had no rain during our workout. The temperature was in the low 50s (F), the sky was cloudy, and there was no wind. All in all, it was a nice day for running.Yesterday I had some soreness in my left leg, and I put Arnica Gel on my leg, and the soreness was gone in about 30 seconds. However, the soreness came back about an hour later, and I put the Gel on again. Same results. Prior to going to bed, I put Arnica on again, and when I woke up this morning, I had no soreness or stiffness in my left leg. I've used Arnica for over 40 years, and it does wonders. It's the best thing I've found for muscle soreness or injury. Arnica is a flower, and the Gel is made from that. My leg feels fine after my 2-mile run today."},
{"title": "Should you do stressful workouts?", "date": "Tuesday, March 04, 2014", "text": "When I grew up in running in the 1970s and 1980s, the emphasis was on Long Slow Distance plus occasional intervals and hills. Today, however, there is more emphasis on shorter but intense workouts, as often as twice a week. This leads us to the question, should I do intense workouts more often?I think the answer to that question depends on your goals for running or walking. If you are primarily interested in racing, then you should follow modern recommends for relatively short but intense workouts a couple of times per week. These workouts should continue through ones taper to a race. At least, the intensity should exist although the distance or time of the workouts might be tapered.However, if your primary interest in running or walking is because you enjoy it, or because you're concerned about your health, forget about intense workouts; such workouts increase the risk of injury.  Run LSD and enjoy it. When I first started running in 1973, medical and sports doctors recommended 1/2 hour three times per week for physical health. I don't know what they recommend today, but doing more than 1/2 hour three times per week is fine, as long as you enjoy it.So, going back to the question asked in the subject of this post, should you do stressful workouts? The answer is ... it depends on your goals. Do what is appropriate for your goals. Do what is appropriate for your body makeup and condition. Do what is appropriate for your age. But, what ever you do, do it because you enjoy it and because you really want to do it."},

Today was a beautiful day, and a lot of people were on the Parkway path, enjoying being outside. The temperature was in the low 50s (F), and there were beautiful clouds in the sky but lots of sun. The Midwest up through Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York, and New England are continuing to have freezing rain and snow. Those folks are really suffering this winter! Unless we get more snow in our mountains, Utah will suffer next summer with a scarcity of water. Northern Utah has a series of reservoirs that store rain and snow-melt water, and, so far, the reservoirs are below normal levels.I run along the Jordan River that connects Utah Lake and the Great Salt Lake, and I can see the water flowing in the river; that level has been low for over a year.Last week my left leg swelled up and became sore when I bent the leg. The swelling was in the upper part of the leg, below the knee. I had started taking a new supplement that provides two enzymes that are used by my body to create energy, and I wondered if that supplement was causing the swelling. I stopped taking the supplement and also stopped running for the week. The swelling went down within a couple of days, and most of the soreness was gone. I don't know for sure if the supplement caused the swelling, because I also had been careless about stretching before and after my run. The recommended dose of the supplement is 2 capsules per day. I restarted the supplement today and will take only one capsule per day. It will take a week or two to see how my body reacts to the capsules. Earlier, I took the supplement for about 10 days before the swelling occurred."},

The temperature outside was in the high 40s (F), so it wouldn't have been bad to go outside today. However, the conditions outside were ideal for hypothermia, and with the forecast of rain, we decided to stay inside and keep dry.I had cooked oatmeal for breakfast about an hour before we left for the rec center. My body needs more time than an hour to handle heavy food like oatmeal, and my stomach didn't feel very good for most of my workout. I felt fine, though, towards the end of the workout and afterwards while we were shopping at Costco.I cringe when I read the weather reports for the NE and southern portions of the US. Those people, especially in the south, are really suffering from storms. I used to live in Massachusetts, and I know what it is like to be without electricity for days at a time; we did burn wood, though, so we had heat in our house. Electrical outages occurred every year. After coming to Utah, I worked part time for three years doing outdoor telephone work, and I know what it is like to be working outside during cold, stormy weather. I ran outdoors year around during my 17 years in Massachusetts, and I enjoyed running in the winter time. I was in my 40s and had a lot of energy. It was common to have sweatcycles hanging down the back of my hair during my runs. My PB for running in the cold was -18 (F). That temperature was measured at my house before I left to go running. It was early in the morning before daylight, and there was no wind blowing. I camped every month with my scout troop, and my coldest campout with measured temperature was -10 (F). However, there was one campout where the temperature was below zero (F), and the wind was blowing 40 or 50 mph. The ground was so hard that the scouts couldn't use stakes to keep their tents from blowing away, and they used granite rocks for that purpose. It was so cold that we packed our things the next morning and went to a place where trees provided protection from the wind. I slept in my hammock, and it was kinda fun to sway in the wind while I was sleeping. I'm in my late 70s now and don't go outside as much in the winter."},

This is the first cold I've had in 2 or 3 years. I had been running for a few years when I realized one day that I didn't get colds anymore. Before I started running, I would get several colds during the year. There are two conditions that cause me to get colds -- over training and insufficient sleep. I haven't been over training, but I have been getting insufficient sleep for several months. In fact, I've been wondering why I didn't have a cold, since I was only getting 5-6 hours of sleep per night. Apparently my immune system was strong enough that the insufficient sleep didn't lower my immunity enough for me to get a cold. Well, my staying up late finally caught up with me. I've been trying to get to bed earlier, and this cold will help me have more motivation toward that end. Last night, for example, I did get to bed earlier last night, but I woke up earlier this morning and didn't go back to sleep. I did, however, take a one-hour nap in the afternoon. But, even with the nap, I only had 6 1/2 hours of sleep.The running literature usually says that it is OK to run through colds. However, due to my age, I go by my body's energy-level, and I had a low level this afternoon, hence the reduction in my running. In fact, my energy-level is my primary metric for determining how hard to push during my training.Our air is still bad. We're expecting a major storm in a couple of days, and that may help clear out our air.

I used those times today. After I finished my workout, I changed my running time to 50 seconds and kept my walking time at 60 seconds. I'll try those times on Monday.I prefer to do workouts on the Jordan River Parkway, because it is easier to do longer distances.

In the rec gym, I'm doing short loops of about 0.1 miles on the indoor track, and it is easy to stop my workout if I get tired. To complete my workout in the rec gym, I must stick with my plan to run or walk xxx minutes, even though I may be getting tired. Of course, if I get really, really tired, I'll abort the workout.

The city of South Jordan plowed the snow from the path, leaving patches of ice on the path, but the city of Sandy did not plow their portion of the path.

The shade temperatures have been below freezing for several days. The high today was in the mid 20s (F), and the low last night was 9.I thought I'd pass on a few suggestions about running on ice. The suggestions are listed in the order I think of the suggestions, not by importance.1.  Don't do it. Perhaps run in the late afternoon after the sun has had a chance to melt some of the ice. If the weather is really bad, consider going to a gym if one is available.2. Don't heel strike. The edge of your heel gives little friction on the ice, and using a heel strike is a path to falling down and possibly being injured. Instead, take smaller steps and run flat-footed. Maximize the contact between your shoe and the ice.3. If the path or road is slick, run along the edges that haven't been packed by vehicles or humans. Loose snow isn't slippery.4. Wear ice shoes that have been equipped with studs. Commercial studs are available, and you can make your own ice shoes using screws put into the sole such that the heads of the screws make contact with the ice.5. Slow down. Consider walking or jogging through patches of ice."},

During the first half, there was a 20 mph (or so) head wind that made running a bit difficult. I wore three layers. As soon as I turned around and headed north, I could tell it was warmer, and I took off my nylon windbreaker, leaving me with two layers. I could have worn running shorts and been comfortable, but I decided at the last minute to wear long running pants."},

The afternoon max temperature is expected to be about 60. I've recognized that I do better in the mornings than in the afternoons. When I was younger, I could run at any time of day or night, but as I get older, I'm finding out that my energy-level goes down as the day progresses, and that morning runs are better because my energy level is higher.We parked at 100th South and went south. There was a strong headwind (10-20 mph) that made running harder, and I looked forward to having that wind as a tail wind on the way back. However, as often happens, the wind died down shortly after I turned around, and the tail wind was about 5 mph. Oh well, running against wind is a good experience, as long as it isn't every run.Not many people were on the path today. A few walkers and one guy on roller blades. He skated like he was skiing, and he used ski poles to push him on his skates. I assume he is a cross-country skier who is keeping in shape during off-skiing times. He was going fast when he passed me; it seemed like he was going as fast as the cyclists go."},

During the early afternoon, I put my two vegetable gardens to bed by rototilling the corn stalks, tomato vines, and other plants so they would decompose during the winter. When I finished, I was too tired to go running, and I stayed home and rested.  My rototiller weights about 70-80 pounds, and it is a struggle to control it when the ground is soft. Doing the rows themselves aren't a problem, but I struggle to turn the machine at the end of each row. When I was younger, I could handle the machine pretty good, but as I get older, I'm finding that my physical ability to turn the machine is limited. As I tilled today, I began to wonder what it would be like in about five years from now, and I realized that in just a few years, I may have to hire someone to do the tilling for me.The following picture of a troybilt tiller is from the web."},

Each rest break was 1-2 minutes.During my last quarter-mile, I passed a group of men and women who were going south. At first I thought they were from Bingham High School, because they had new running shorts and t-shirts, but I realized they were older than high school students, and I decided they were from the Police Academy. When I finished my run, I asked a man who was timing if they were from the Police Academy, and he said \"yes\". While we were talking, the first runner finished the 1.5 miles, and the timer gave the time of 9 minutes and about 15 or 20 seconds. The runner was really pushing to finish the run. A second runner came in about 30 seconds later.The temperature was in the mid to high 50s (F) during my run, and I wore long pants, because I knew the sun would be down before I finished, and in the desert, the temperature plummets as soon as the sun goes down.

The swelling started at the same time that my right quad felt tight. I've been taking a natural remedy for joint-stiffness and soreness, and I've temporarily stopped that to see if it is the cause of my right leg being swollen. So far, I haven't notice any change.I've mentioned in previous posts, there is an old apple tree about at the 0.7 mile mark on the path. I stopped at the tree to get an apple and found that all of the apples I can reach are gone (apparently someone got there before I did). There are some nice looking apples up high, but I can't reach them. I did get a small one to eat, and my wife, who can reach higher than me, got another one for me. The apples taste good.

I'm still using a run/walk ratio of 90 seconds running and 60 seconds walking. I measured my stride rate at 136 steps per minute. I used to do 175 steps per minute, so I'm getting slower as I age. All runners should aim for a stride rate of 170-180 steps per minute. Doing this will help avoid shin splints and will help runners use a midfoot strike instead of a heel strike.The sky was cloudy when I began my run, and it rained for about 10 minutes.

My wife came with me to the Jordan River Parkway, and she walked approximately 1.8 miles. I didn't carry any water with me and used the fountain at the parking lot at the beginning and end of my run. When I do carry water, I use a fuel belt that holds six 8-ounce bottles.On the way back, I saw two flocks of quail. I was closer to them than I was on Monday, and I confirmed in my mind that they were quail. There were about a dozen in the first flock and about 6 or 7 quail in the second flock. The younguns are getting pretty big, so they are finding sufficient food to allow them to grow. I don't remember seeing quail during the winter, so they must migrate south or somewhere. They can fly, but I usually see them when they are walking on the path.On my way back, I was passed by a younger runner ( probably in his later 30s), and he asked how I was feeling. I replied, \"tired\". And, then I added, \"I'm getting old\". He replied with, \"You're doing good\".I was tired during my run. Not from running but from mowing my lawns this afternoon. I cut some of the lawn on Tuesday evening. Then I cut some more last evening, and I finished it this afternoon. Mowing my lawn takes more time than I spend on running, and it takes more energy than running. I'm glad that tomorrow is a rest day. I water my lawns via a sprinkling system that turns on during the night, every other day. So, I don't have to spend time or energy watering my lawn. When I lived in Massachusetts, I never watered my lawn or garden -- I let mother nature do it for me. Here in the Utah desert, I have to water everything three or four times per week."},

{"title": "A week of hiking", "date": "Saturday, August 10, 2013", "text": "I didn't do any running this week, but I did a lot of hiking. My wife and I joined our daughter and her family and drove on Monday to Southern Utah to see Shakespeare plays and visit national parks. I hiked about 10 miles during the week. We met our daughter at Cove Fort, and we toured the pioneer fort.On Tuesday, we visited several places in Cedar City where I had lived and played as a child. We planned to go to \"boys cave\" next to the red hill, but the access to the hill containing the cave is now private property, and I decided to not try and get permission to pass through their back yard. We thus aborted our hike to \"boys cave\". Boy's cave is not really a cave. It is just a wind-swept indention in the side of a rock. To us boys, though, it was a real cave and was large enough to allow several boys to sit in the cave  and look to the red hill east of us.On Wednesday, we hiked Kolob Canyon, and I covered 4 of the 5 miles of that hike. The trail, if I may call it that, followed a creek and went up and down and up and down and... I can handle hikes on relatively level ground, but I'm not in condition for hiking up and down hills and climbing over rocks. The hardest part was at the end of the hike when I had to go about 100 feet up a cliff by climbing a million stairs. At the beginning of the climb, I could go about 10 steps before I took a rest. In the middle, I was going about 5 steps before a rest, and at the end I was going three steps before a rest. The afternoon was hot, and I had used up all my water and was thirsty. I was glad to finish that hike. During the hike, I wished I had brought my walking stick with me. I've never had good balance. As I get older, my balance is worse, and I have a hard time climbing over rocks and jumping from rock to rock to cross creeks. Having the walking stick to provide a third \"leg\" would have helped a lot. During my 11-years as Scoutmaster in Massachusetts, I found that the walking stick was helpful in giving me better balance as I hiked rough trails. After I finished the hike, I sat in my car and waited for the rest of our group. After they arrived, I got out of the car and was immediately attacked by cramps in my left leg. Usually, cramps only last a few seconds, but this cramp didn't go away. I couldn't move my leg, so I massaged the leg. The cramp shifted to the other leg but didn't decrease in intensity. Finally, after about 5 minutes the cramp dissipated, and I was able to drive back to our home for the week in Cedar CityOn Thursday, we drove an hour to Zion National Park and completed a 2-mile hike along the Virgin River (Riverside Trail) to the beginning of the Narrows. The trail was mostly flat and the path was paved and easy to walk. The rest of the afternoon was spent lollygagging around the Lodge. We happened to see Gary, my brother-in-law, and part of his family who had just completed a 17-mile hike through the Narrows. The following picture was taken from the web (click picture for a larger image).On Friday we returned to Zion and hiked a dirt, rocky trail to a swimming place in Zion. It was only a mile each way, but I never made it. I did fine during the first half-mile, because the ground was relatively level and there weren't a lot of rocks in the path. But, during the second half-mile the trail went up-hill more, and I realized I was getting tired, and I turned back. My wife said it was good I turned back, because there was a 10-foot climb up several rocks, and she said I never would have made it. I didn't bring my fanny pack that holds two bottles of water, so I was carrying one bottle in my hand. On the way back, I had to climb over a big rock to get from the creek to the bank, and I tossed my water bottle into the sand on the bank so I could use both hands to climb the rock. When the bottle hit the sand, the top came off, and all of my water and ice cubes spilled onto the sand. I still had about 1/3 mile left, and I had no water. The temperature was in the low 90s (F), and I got pretty thirsty before I finished the hike. After I reached my car, I drove to the visitor's center to get water, but the parking lots were full, and I returned with no water. However, when I returned I found that my wife was in my daughter's car -- she had turned back, too. She shared her water with me.After leaving Zion, we stopped at Kolob Reservoir, and we saw a California Condor flying above the water. There are only about 150 of these birds in existence. We later looked at the photo my son-in-law took of the bird, and we could see the tag put on the bird to track its flights. The tag was #75. The condors have a wing-span averaging 9 feet. The following pictures of a California Condor (#4) and Kolob Reservoir were taken from the web (click the pictures for a larger views).This morning, on our way back to the Salt Lake valley, we stopped at Bryce National Park, and my daughter's family and I hiked a short way into the canyon and back. I went about 1/4 mile each way. I could have gone farther, but the descent was all switchbacks, and each step downhill was 3-5 steps (in effort) uphill. During that descent, I changed elevation by about 200 feet.  The elevation at the top is about 9000 feet, and hiking at that elevation is more difficult than hiking at lower elevations.The following pictures of Kolob Canyon and Bryce were taken from the web. The picture of Bryce shows the switchbacks I hiked (click the pictures for larger views)."},

I could have had my daughter mover her car so I could get mine out of the garage, but I chose to leave the cars as they were, and I thus ran the maintenance road next to a canal, because the road wasn't far from my home. I walked about 0.1 mile and then started running. I was out early (7:30 am) and the cool temperature felt great. Lots of shade. Our afternoon high hit 95 (F), so getting out early was nice.I saw lots of ducks and geese on the maintenance road. Usually, the geese are browsing the fields, but this morning they were on the road. On my way back, I approached a flock of geese that were on the road, maybe 30-40 geese. As I approached them during a walk-phase, they didn't fly away. They just stayed on the path. There was about 10 feet separating us when they started to walk towards the field. I started a run-phase while I was surrounded by geese, and that startled them, and many of them flew away while the others continued walking to the field. After I had passed them and had gone about 50 yards, I turned around and looked at them, and they were back on the road.On my way out, I passed a field full of birds that were browsing the field. The birds were black and were smaller than a Mallard duck. They had long necks, small heads, and relatively long beaks. They looked like water-birds. I couldn't get close enough to see if their feet were webbed.It's been over 5 years since I last ran this maintenance road, and it was nice to be back on the road. The road is dirt with some gravel on it, but it is relatively level and easy to run. I saw lots of ducks that were born in May or June, and they were now almost as big as their mother and were independent of her. They were, however, still sticking together as a \"clan\".I took a nap when I got home, and the nap and my sleep last night meant I got 7 1/2 hours of sleep."},

In addition, I had a good drink of water at home before I left, at the start and end of my run, and at the turn-around point. I used my normal ratio of 60 seconds running and 60 seconds walking.I felt pretty good during the first half of my run,  but I got a bit dizzy during the return phase back to my car. The dizzy feeling was slight and occurred during the last half mile or so. It was, I assume, due to the heat, because I've felt fine since then. After I got home, I took a half-hour nap. There was a south breeze of 5 mph or so, and that felt good. I didn't take any rest breaks on the way out, but I did take 3 breaks on shady benches on the way back. During these hot summers, I run for survival and give no thought to trying to increase my distance much or my pace. I save performance improvements for the Spring and Fall and just try to survive during the summer and winter."},

I went south from 100th South for half a mile and then returned to the parking lot. After a good drink, I ran 1 mile north to the Sandy golf course and then returned to the parking lot. I did 2.9 miles in 63 minutes plus about 1/8 mile walking after I stopped my GPS timer.Last week we had a lot of rain (for a desert area, at least) and the resulting cooler temperatures, but this week will be all hot sun. I only had 5 1/2 hours sleep last night, and I took a long nap after my run to bring me up to my desired 7 hours of sleep.I've been using a run/walk ratio of 60 seconds each, but last week I ran 80 seconds with 60 seconds walking. Today, due to the hot weather, I went back to the ratio of 60 seconds each.After I reached the Sandy golf course and my 1-mile point, I took a several mention on a bench next to the path. I saw two women walking and pushing two-wheeled golf carts. After I started running, I passed the ladies and mentioned to them that I was glad they were walking and not riding golf carts. One lady remarked \"we do anything to keep moving\". I replied that the guys who ride the carts are heading for heart attacks as they get older. After I had passed the ladies and was about 20 feet in front of them, I heard one of them say, \"When I grow up I want to be like you\". I thought to my self, \"good luck\".

However, it was down yesterday even though I only had the 4.5 hours of sleep the night before plus an hour in two naps later in the day (after my running). It is common to have a delay between a night of insufficient sleep and a rise in my HR. Last night I had a good 7 hours sleep, and that probably accounts for the drop in my HR this morning.

I felt great today and did the situps pretty fast.The sky was cloudy (showers forecast for tonight and tomorrow), and the temperature was in the mid 70s (F) during my run/walk. I didn't carry water but had good drinks before and after my run. I kept the length of my walk phase to 60 seconds but increased the length of my run phase to 80 seconds.

A few rain drops fell during the first part of my run, but they didn't amount to anything, and the \"shower\" only lasted for a few minutes.I didn't see other runners on the Parkway, but I did see cyclists and walkers and dogs.For several years I thought quail couldn't fly, because I only saw them walking on the asphalt path. However, in recent weeks, I've seen quail fly. I saw one this morning perched on a tall (7 feet) wooden pole. It flew to the ground as I passed the pole.The Jordan River is very low. Sand banks that usually are covered with water are growing nice crops of grass and small bushes. I hope we get rain tonight and tomorrow -- we need the water, and the relief from the summer heat is nice.Notice, in the following photo of Italy taken from the web, that you can see rain coming down.

I didn't run on the right side of the path as most people do. I didn't run tangents as if I were in a race. Instead, I ran \"shadows\", cris-crossing the path to run in the few patches of shade that were on the path.

They were swimming against the stream and were paddling their feet just enough to overcome to river, causing them to remain in the same spot. Every few seconds they would poke their head into the water to catch something that was floating by. About 5 or 6 black birds (ducks?) were doing the same thing. These birds were all black, including their heads, except for a large white spot on their breasts. I took the following picture a few years ago, and it shows the type of duck I saw today."},

My energy level stayed relatively high during the run. All in all, I think I handled the heat OK. I went slow and enjoyed being outside.I had the path mostly to myself. I didn't see any other runners until I was half a mile from the end and I saw several members of the police academy out for a training run. I could tell they were from the academy, because they all had blue shorts and white t-shirts with the academy logo. When they passed, I was sitting on a bench, and they all called me \"sir\" as they passed me. While I ran, I did see 4 walkers, a couple of cyclists (one a boy about 11 or 12 who was sitting in the shade with his bike on the ground next to him) and a girl on skates. She gave me a thumbs up as she flew past me. I frequently get thumbs up from others on the path. I guess they aren't used to seeing an old geezer out running.When I got home, I changed into dry clothes and took an hour nap. In another hour and a half, the temperature will be below 90, and I'll just have time to mow my lawns before it gets dark.

My wife and I walked to and from church the past two Sundays (about 2.5 miles for the two days). Some of my grandkids walked with my wife and me to the nearby canal and fed the ducks and looked at the new ducklings (about a mile for the loop). Mowing my lawns each week takes me about an hour -- all walking and pushing my old mower. So, I haven't been sitting on a couch all day...."},

I need more than one day of rest after I do my lawns, and I was tired during my run. I'm going to try to mow my lawns on Thursday so I will have two days of rest before my Saturday run.

In fact, the parking lot at 100th South had about 15 cars, significantly more than the 5 or 6 cars that are usually there. At first, I thought the police academy was having a qualification run, but I didn't see any police cars in the parking lot, and I realized the cars were all civilian cars.I ran the same 3-mile route that I used on Wednesday. I didn't keep track of my time, but the run probably took about 55 minutes. I used my Fuel Belt for the first time this year, and I followed the same schedule I've used in the past -- one swallow of water each time I started walking, that's a swallow every two minutes. Each bottle in my Fuel Belt holds one cup, and I empty the bottle every mile. I also got a drink from the water fountain at 100th South at the beginning and end of my run/walk. The temperature wasn't particularly high today, but I was glad I carried water with me. After about 1.5 miles I started sweating, and the water helped replace that lost via sweating.Now, after I eat brunch and take a short nap, I'll mow my lawns.

It isn't very visible in the picture, but the belt has a nice pouch that I use for my cell phone.My wakeup heart rate was 58 this morning, after a good 7 hours sleep. It was 63 or 64 last week. If I continue getting good sleep, my heart rate should continue going down. I'm leaving in about an hour to go running so I get my running in early.

I didn't record my wakeup heart rate this morning, because of the lack of sleep, but I felt relatively fine during my run. I've been using run/walk times of 60 seconds/35 seconds, but I read that Galloway recommends having the two times the same, so in the middle of the run, I changed the timer to give 60seconds/60 seconds. I'm not concerned with overall speed, and the extra 25 seconds of walking helps me recover for the next 60 seconds of running.My basic problem with lack of sleep is that I really enjoy doing things at night. I've always  been a \"night owl\" in this regard. In the summers during high school, I was a bellhop at a resort hotel, and I worked 18 hours out of 24 (two 9-hour shifts) and then had the next 24 hours off while the other guy worked his two shifts. During my 24 hours off, I stayed up late at night making ham radio contacts all over North America and the Pacific islands. I would sleep in late until 10 or 11, and then I would get ready for my two shifts. But, as I've gotten older, I'm finding it harder to sleep in late but still easy to stay up late. I'm having to go to bed earlier to get my seven hours of sleep before I wake up. Mornings are for sleeping and nights are for doing things...too bad society doesn't realize that :)"},

One guy asked me, as he ran past, if I were OK. I said, \"Yes, just taking a rest break\". The temperature was 84 (F) when I left home and 81 when I returned. I think Spring is gone and summer is here.... This warm weather is not good. It may melt the snow in the mountains and cause flooding in the valleys and then a drought in the summer.I ran in the late afternoon as the sun was going down. Due to the late hour, there was a lot of shade on the trail, and that felt good. There was a slight south breeze blowing, which helped cool me and didn't offer much opposition to my running.

Then, during the summer I raise the mower to yield about 2 1/2 inches of length to the blades of grass. Today, I had the mower set so low, that I had to push the mower to get the machine to move through the grass, even though the motor on the mower was trying to move the machine. It took me over an hour of such work to finish my lawns, and I was really tired when I finished. My grass is Kentucky Blue grass, and it won't go green for another month.

Over and over, Iwas told how two thirds of all patients experience fatigue some time after thehalfway point. I was waiting for the shoe to fall but now halfway through my 31therapies, I had great energy. “How’s your energy?” She asked, though she looked at my chart, not me.“Good.

I only do 45 minutes of that.” I was a littleworried that telling her this would somehow cause me to be benched.“That’sa lot of working out.” She looked at me, eyebrows raised.

Thephysician’s assistant, who had followed my story, smirked. “How often do you dothat, Francie?”I hesitated with a crooked smile. “Six days.” “Exceptional.

There were quite a few people out enjoying the day.The Jordan River is very low, compared to this time last year. This means that the powers-that-be aren't releasing any extra water from Utah Lake into the river. A weather report on the radio said our snow pack is 80% of normal, so we'll likely have a water shortage in the summer, unless we get a lot of snow up there before summer. Another factor is the temperature. If it gets warm too early, the snow in the mountain melts too fast and creates flood-like conditions in the rivers, and we still have a water shortage in the summer. The ideal conditions are a lot of snow in the mountains and a cool Spring."},

I didn’thave one moment when I regretted being out there. I praised God for the opportunityand asked Him to keep helping me through my journey. The sidewalk quickly movedpast me. So much for worrying about how hard it would be to get moving again.The doubt demons were at it again, telling me I wouldn’t be able to keeprunning, but my legs put a stop to them. Running felt so natural and easy. Mybody craved the warm sun, the breeze in my face. I wanted to be out there fortwo hours. I settled for 42 glorious minutes. Later, I texted my runningpartner, Ben. My words are a great summary of that run: Me: Went runningtoday. I’m not sayin’ it didn’t hurt. I’m not sayin’ it was a mistake.Thrilled.Ben: AWESOME! Grinning, I saved Ben’s text for a verylong time. His encouragement came in handy many days.

Running just one day gave me the graceto unlock new hope. It was always in me but there was so much fear in the way,I couldn’t see it. In the days that followed, I felt so renewed and refreshedas I pushed through recovery. How down I had been! It’s true that I had no ideajust how bad I felt until I began feeling good.

However, I only had 4 hours sleep Saturday night, and that lack of sleep got to me after 40 minutes.I have an anxiety problem that causes me to not sleep very well when I have something important scheduled for early in the morning. My son-in-law came down from Evanston, WY, on Saturday evening, and I drove him to the Salt Lake airport Sunday morning; we left home at 7 am. I slept well the night before until about 4:30, and then I woke up and didn't go back to sleep.

I like the Fruitdale tour, because it is 4.5 miles of flat riding (no gear changing, and long straightaways before a turn).I think my legs are still tired from my horrendous ride on Tuesday. I normally would have run/walked yesterday, but I postponed it a day to give my body extra rest. When I was younger, 48 hours between heavy runs was sufficient.

During warmer weather I do a lot of yard work, including mowing lawns weekly and rototilling during the Spring and Fall, and that serves as my cross training. During the Winter I'm not in my yard, and I need to do something for cross training. Cycling, if I take it easy, is good cross training, as is walking. When I was younger, I ran about half the distance that I did for my stressful runs, but as I've gotten older, I reduced my running to 2-3 times per week.

I wasn't registered as a rider, so I was a Guest while I rode. Expresso bikes are interesting. A monitor screen shows the route I have chosen. I have to steer the bike and shift gears according to the terrain. The Alpine road has a lot of up and down hills, causing me to shift gears a lot, and it was a hard route to take on my first time on the bike. After I returned home, I went to Expresso.com and signed up as a rider so the computer will keep track of my times and routes for me. Riding the Expresso bike was an interesting experience. I haven't ridden a bike for about 30 years, and I'm not in great shape. I used to ride a bike to work when I lived in Phoenix, and I rode it in Massachusetts to a friend's house and then took a Van Pool to work.

I ran for 2 minutes and walked for 1 minute. There were quite a few people using the rec center: swimming, basketball, soccer, weights, various aerobic machines, and runners and walkers on the indoor track. I don't use the rec center very often, but it is nice when the streets are icy and snowy."},
{"title": "Ran/walked for 3 miles", "date": "Tuesday, December 11, 2012", "text": "I didn't run much last week because my wakeup heart rate was 64-65. Today, however, it was down to 60, and I went running. The temperature was 40 (F) when I left home about 4:30 pm. The sun was still up when I started running, but by the time I had completed the first mile, the sun was behind the Oquirrh Mountains. The run took me about 55 minutes. Due to the height of the mountains we have an early sunset but a longer dusk before darkness. I completed my workout before darkness. During the first half I had a head-wind of about 10 mph, and the chill factor made it colder than I had expected. I had my usual three layers, but I felt cold. However, my body warmed up as I continued my workout, and I felt fine on the way back. The wind was now a tail-wind, and that helped me to be warmer, too. The path was free of snow, but there were wet spots due to melting snow. I waited until late afternoon to go out so the sun could melt the snow and dry the path, and the wet spots weren't frozen and presented no problems.I forgot my GPS and timer again, so I ran for 1/4 mile and then walked about 45-60 seconds. I've been running this part of the Parkway for several years, and I know where the quarter-mile points are, so it was easy to change my pace every quarter mile. I felt fine during my workout, but I was glad to go home after I had completed three miles. This is the second time I've run longer before I walked, and I'm going to have to set my timer for a longer run-phase."},

Because I ran for more seconds than I've been doing, and because my heart rate was relatively high, I stopped after two miles. I felt good during the two miles, but I was starting to get tired, and I'm glad I didn't go farther.We had rain during the night and early morning, and it was sprinkling during my run.

I felt fine during the runs and took no rest breaks. I completed 3.2 miles during the hour. I wore my running shorts and a T-shirt and enjoyed the warm day, although I hope we get lots of snow in the mountains this winter. I wore my wind breaker during the first half-hour, and then after my body was warmed up, I took the jacket off and tied it around my waist.Running and walking for 60 seconds is working fine for me. In a couple of weeks, if I still feel fine, I'll add another 5 seconds to the times. I saw lots of geese in the field that had them on Saturday.  The field also had 2 horses, and the geese and horses seemed to not be bothered by the other animals in the field."},
{"title": "A great 65-minute run/walk", "date": "Saturday, November 17, 2012", "text": "I didn't measure my wakeup heart rate this morning, but I felt pretty good, thanks to several nights of good sleep. I added 5 seconds to both my running and walking (60 seconds each phase) and covered 3.33 miles in 65 minutes. I went north from 100th South. When I got to the golf course, instead of following the yellow line through the golf course to the temporary end of the trail at Riverside Drive, I went north past the west side of the golf pro shop on a straight line to 90th South. Then I followed the path in a loop through the golf course and back to the pro shop and a mile back to my car. The temperature was in the high 40s (F) when I started and in the low 50s when I finished. The sky was mostly cloudy, and it was a great day for running.Google maps gives a good view of the path I followed this morning. Find the intersection of 100th South in South Jordan City and the Jordan River and zoom in until you see the Parkway trail going through a tunnel under 100th South (I do my stretches in that tunnel at the end of my runs). The picture to the right shows the tunnel. The small white car that is at the bottom-center of the picture is my car (The picture was taken a few years ago). Since my car is in the picture, I thought I might be seen on the path. I searched the path from the new bridge across 11400 South, which was just being built, to the temporary end of the path about 3/4 mile north of the parking lot, but I didn't see me. I did see several walkers or runners, but I wasn't one of them because their shorts were the wrong color.Click a picture for a larger view.Follow the path north until it crosses a bridge across the river to the golf course. You'll see the golf course pro shop, which is a large building on the other side of the river, and the trail is marked going past the south side of the building to Riverside Drive in Sandy City. Instead of taking that path in my run this morning, I took a path that goes past the west side of the building north to just before 90th South. The picture to the left shows the pro shop and the paths going past the pro shop.I approached 90th South on an asphalt path that is shown in the picture to the right. I crossed a bridge back across the river and followed the path as it wound through the golf course back to the pro shop, crossing the river on a narrow bridge that isn't shown in any of the pictures.As a side note, the only safe way to cross 90th South is to take the Parkway path past the pro shop to Riverside Drive and follow that street to the intersection of 700 West and 90th South. About 3/4 mile north of 90th South on 700 West, an entrance to the Parkway trail is marked, and the trail goes north past Salt Lake City to Davis County. So far, I've gone on the trail to 3900 South, which is about 5 miles south of Salt Lake City.I've noticed that Canadian geese like fields instead of the river. Ducks are always in the river, and the geese are always in fields. Today, I saw a huge flock of geese in a field. I guess  geese forage in the field for food, while ducks forage in the river for food, although with winter coming, the ducks are spending more time on the asphalt path and nearby dirt looking for food. The following picture of geese in a field is from the web. That picture shows approximately 30 geese. The flock I saw had 100-200 geese."},

However, while waiting for the temperature to get above freezing, I ate a heavy breakfast. I knew it would take a while for my stomach to adjust to the breakfast, so I planned on going out in early afternoon. I felt fine when I left for my run, but as soon as I started running, my stomach acted like it had the flu or something. After about 20 feet, I decreased my pace to a fast walk. I felt fine while walking, but I couldn't run very far. So, I walked most of the first mile. I could tell, though, that my spurts of running were getting longer. After about a mile and a half, my stomach felt fine, and I resumed my normal alternating of 55 seconds running and 55 seconds walking. The temperature during my run was in the low 40s (F), and it was a beautiful, sunny day. The snow on the ground is melting, and in a couple of days it will be gone. Today was another lesson that my breakfasts must be lighter and more easily digested. I thought 4 hours would be enough time between breakfast and my run, but it wasn't."},

Except for a few shady spots, the path was free of snow, but it was wet from melting snow. Because I ran in late afternoon, there was a danger of the water freezing, making the path slick, and I reduced my run to be sure I would be finished before the sun set behind the Oquirrh Mountains. In addition, I hadn't eaten much since last night, and my body wasn't developing much heat -- I barely had enough energy to do the short run. I felt the cold more than I had expected, likely due to my lack of food during the day and to this being my first experience this winter with cold (it takes a few runs for my body to adapt to the colder temperatures). The shade temperature during my run was slightly above freezing, and I wore my usual three layers. There was no wind during my run."},

Yesterday, I spent a good part of the day doing yard work, including mowing my lawns, and that caused my body to be tired today. Not only was there grass to be cut but lots of leaves to  be sucked up by the mower. The leaves meant that I had to empty the bag more often, and a full bag weighed more. I have to do the Fall rototilling of my vegetable gardens tomorrow and/or Friday, so I'll probably be tired on Saturday.Today was another great Fall day with temperatures in the mod 60s during my run.

I read emails and made some comments in blogs, and then I took a nap for about half an hour. After my nap, my pulse rate was 56, so I went running and completed 3.1 miles in my allotment of 60 minutes. I didn't have a lot of energy and knew from the beginning that the run wouldn't be very good. I felt OK and went slower during the first half of the run, but I was tired during the second half and took two two or three short rest breaks. I was glad to get back to my car. I saw a couple of runners on the path, several walkers, and several cyclists. It's nice to have a few great days before the dreary winter sets in.Unlike the East coast that is bracing for hurricane Sandy to hit the New Jersey coast in a few hours, the weather in Utah was a beautiful day for running. The temperature was in the low 60s (F), partially cloudy sky, and wind gusts of 10-15 mph. I lived in Massachusetts for 17 years and know what it is like to be in the path of a hurricane: stores shelves empty, tree limbs falling on power lines, schools and businesses closed, and fear. Power outages happened every year in New England. The longest time we were without power was a week. We had a wood stove and had heat, but we had no water for culinary and sanitary use. We were able to melt snow and get small amounts of water for drinking and cooking. The back roads in Massachusetts are narrow, and tree limbs arch over the road. When we had a heavy snow or high winds, the limbs came down and took the power lines with them. I remember one snow storm in late May. The trees had new leaves, and a heavy-snow storm brought down many limbs. I remember walking outside and hearing pops all throughout the forest. Each pop was a limb breaking and crashing to the ground.The following pictures, taken from the web, show New England winter storms."},

I completed 4.5 miles. The sky was cloudy, although there were patches of blue sky here and there. There was a scattering of snow falling when I started my run, but the rest of the run was without snow and with times of sun and times of shade. The sun was setting behind the Oquirrh Mountains when I reached my turn-around, and I finished the run a few minutes before it became dark. After I completed the run, I spent a few minutes stretching and then walked a short distance to my car. It was just starting to snow as I approached the car, and by the time I reached home, it was a heavy snow. It apparently didn't snow for very long, because the sidewalks outside have just a very light covering of snow.I wore long pants and my normal 3 layers during the run, but I had no gloves and no hat. Except for my hands, I felt fine while I was outside. When I first start to run, my body diverts blood from my limbs to my body-core to keep my internal organs warm. When I was younger (my 40s and 50s), my hands would warm up after about a mile of running, but I've noticed during recent years, that my hands remain cold during the run, one of the trials of getting older, I suppose.I've been running in the iZUMI shoes that I received for testing a couple of years ago. Today, though, I wore my LOCO shoes, because I wanted to try a pair of OrothoLite insoles. I put one in the right shoe and left the original insole in the left shoe. See my runninginjuryfree.org blog for my report on the OrthoLite insoles. I didn't use the iZUMI shoes because they already have OrthoLite insoles in them."},

I went to bed at a reasonable time, but I woke up earlier and couldn't go back to sleep. We had company staying with us that night, and I may have been suffering from anxiety. Also, I knew the next few days would be busy, and that may have increased my anxiety. Last night was a good 7 hours of sleep. Hopefully, I'll continue getting 7 hours this week.Today was a cloudy day (rain showers are predicted), and the temperature was in the mid 60s (F). A 5 mph wind was blowing from the south, with gusts up to 10 mph or so. All in all, it was a nice day for running and walking.

People walked from the cars to the path, and I realized that cadets from the Police Academy were coming to take their qualifying run. They have to run 1.5 miles in 15 minutes. The officials at the Academy have marked 0.75 miles with a green line across the path and the word POST next to the line. That is the turn-around point for the qualifying test. I started my run before the cadets, and I was about 1/8 mile from the green line when the first two cadets passed me. I was past the green line before other cadets arrived, and I never saw them. I went to the tunnel under 106th South and saw that the path was flooded by rain water, so I turned around. By the time I reached the green line, the three officials (wearing red T-shirts) were gone, and when I reached the parking lot, all of the cars that brought the cadets were gone, too. I finished my run by going north about 0.5 miles and back.South Jordan City has turned off the water fountains, so during the winter if I need water during my workouts, I'll have to carry it.

It's past 7 pm, and I haven't had much to eat all day, so I'm off to cook some oatmeal."},

Even after 2 days of no running, I'm still not recovered from the 200 minutes I did on Friday.There was a light sprinkle during my first mile, and then the rain stopped and the sun came out. It got warmer due to the sun, but it was still cooler than last week.I didn't accurately check my wakeup heart rate, but it was close to 57."},
{"title": "Completed a 200 minute long run", "date": "Friday, September 07, 2012", "text": "My wakeup heart rate was 58, lower than the 62 in the middle of the week but still much higher than I would like. I'm focusing on getting to bed earlier, because that is the only way my wakeup heart rate will come down.My 140 minute run/walk turned into a 200 minute run/walk (8.3 miles). I started at my stopping point two weeks ago (about 5800 North) on my trek to the Great Salt Lake. I had planned to go north for 70 minutes and then return to my car. However, when the 70 minute time arrived, I was in the middle of nowhere. Trees everywhere. No buildings in sight.I was concerned about finding a parking lot for my next segment leading to the GSL. I knew I could either go back about a mile to a parking lot, or I could continue going north until I came to a parking lot. During my trek through Murray City, I became spoiled because Murray has parking lots every mile. After I left Murray City, I went through Taylorsville City and was now in West Valley City. I decided to continue going north, and I finally came to a city park with a nice parking lot (it was about 2 miles from this parking lot to the last one I had passed through on my way north). I asked a lady what city I was in, and she said West Valley City, although the South Salt Lake police service the area. There was a four-lane busy street which the lady said was 3900 South. So, I went out (and back) about 19 blocks as the crow flies for a distance of about 4.15 miles as the path went. Nineteen blocks translates to 3.12 miles, so the meandering of the path amounted to about an extra 1 mile.I had plenty of water, because I passed several water fountains and filled my water bottles, both going out and coming back. Even though the temperature was in the mid 80s (F) and there was a lot of shade from tall trees lining the west side of the path, I was glad for the water. I did extra walking during the last mile going out, and even more walking on the way back. I felt great during the first hour, began getting tired during the second hour, and I was pretty tired during the third hour and 20 minutes. I took a couple of rest stops for several minutes each on the way back.I only saw a few runners and walkers, but I saw a lot of cyclists. The phases I do on my next several run/walks north will be in an area with a relatively high crime rate. I'm thinking I will carry with me a spray can of Pepper spray. I will be out in the middle of the day, and that may discourage muggers. Much of the path is in remote areas, and there aren't many people to help me if I should be attacked. As long as I pass cyclists, I'll probably be OK since the cyclists know the area and would (I hope) stay away from the path if it were really dangerous."},

The temperature was 80 (F) when I left home, but the sun felt hot. I did 3.0 miles during my run. I took a two-minute rest-break, on the way back with a mile left to go. That bench is the only one on my route. It is in the sun, but that's OK. I went a little faster on the way out and got a bit closer to the light at 700 West and 9000 South. I drank my customary one bottle (1 cup) of water per mile, taking a swallow every walking phase.My wakeup heart rate was 57 this morning. Slightly lower than last week. I haven't been doing very well on getting to sleep earlier. I love night-time (up to about 3 am), and I have a hard time stopping things and going to bed. But, sleep deprivation means a higher wakeup heart rate and less endurance during my run."},

My wife did flowers for two weddings, and I did a video of the first wedding. On the day of the second wedding, I spent much of the day mowing and edging my lawns so my yard would look nice to visitors to the wedding reception (across the street from my house). I bought a new Troy edger because my old electric edger didn't have enough power to cut through the grass and dirt. The new edger made edging a quick and enjoyable thing. The new edger has a wheel that moves up and down to account for differences in height at a curb, but I couldn't get the wheel to move. There are two bolts that hold the wheel in place, and I couldn't turn the nuts on the bolts. So, I just ran the edger on the grass instead of on the street.On Monday, August 20, I visited with the blood-clot specialist at Intermountain Health Clinic, and he agreed that I could go off of Warfarin (genetic Coumadin). I had swelling in both legs, and he told me to go to the Lymphedema Clinic (in the building next door). On the following Friday, I went to the clinic and came home with a compression stocking on one foot and a big bandage (foam rubber covered with Ace-type bandages) on the other foot. I wasn't able to do my Saturday run because of the big bandage on my foot and leg. I returned to the clinic on Monday and Tuesday of this week. The swelling is mostly gone, my right leg has stopped \"weeping\", and I'll be wearing compression stockings for the rest of my life. I don't have to return to the clinic.I ran for about 45 minutes today and did about two slow miles. I was pretty tired and aborted the run instead of going the full 60 minutes. I had plenty of water during the run, but I didn't get enough sleep during the past two weeks, and my wakeup heart rate is high.The daytime temperature is still hot (maximum is about 95 (F)), and the night lows are in the 60s. September will be here very soon, and that means the temperatures will drop and running will be more fun. I've always maintained that I run for improvement in the Spring and Fall, and I run to survive in the Winter and Summer."},

The temperature was in the high 80s, but the sky became cloudy and the wind picked up while I was out. Thunderstorms are expected this evening. My wakeup pulse was 59 this morning, two points higher than last week. I've had two days rest since my long run on Saturday, but they weren't really rest days. Well, Sunday was a rest day, but yesterday was a busy day, and I was on my feet a lot and didn't get an afternoon nap. As I get older, I need more time for recovery."},

I requested through my PCP that I be revaluated to see if I could stop taking the Warfarin. Yesterday morning I met with the Intermountain Health Care specialist for blood clots, and he agreed that I could stop taking Warfarin. He had both of my legs scanned for blood clots (none seen). He did ask me to wear compression socks to reduce some swelling in my legs, and I have an appointment for that this Friday. It was a happy experience last night to go to bed without taking a pill. Now, I'm not taking any prescribed drugs!"},
{"title": "Ran/walked 140 minutes again", "date": "Saturday, August 18, 2012", "text": "For my long run this week, I repeated the time (140 minutes) done last week but on a different route. I only did 6.2 miles because I did more walking on the way back. Last week I ended at a parking lot on 78th South. Today I started at that parking lot and went north for 3.5 miles, about 1/4 mile north (about 57th South) of a parking lot and entrance to the Jordan River Parkway in Murray City at Bullion Street. Next week, if I feel up to it, I'll start at the parking lot at Bullion Street and go north for 3.5 miles; that distance should put me in South Salt Lake City. My wakeup heart rate was 57.Last week, I only had one bottle (1 cup) of water for the 3.5 miles back, and I had to ration the water during the return distance. This week, I started rationing the water at the beginning of my run, taking a swallow every other walking phase instead of every walking phase. I was pleasantly surprised when I got into Murray City to find an entrance to the Parkway Path that was a nice Park. There was a water fountain, rest rooms, large Pavilion, and a playground for kids. I didn't think about replenishing my water on my way out, and I continued to ration my water. On the way back, however, I filled three water bottles and had plenty of water for that last 2.5 miles. It was hot today, and I was glad for the extra water, especially since I had lost one of my bottles of water and was expecting to only have four bottles for the round trip. Murray didn't have many benches along the trail, and those that were there were in the afternoon sun, and I didn't take a rest-break. I did find a bench in Murray that was in the shade, and I took a long (5 minutes) break. West Jordan City had quite a few benches along the trail, but most of them were in the sun. I took a two-minute break at one of the benches, only to find that a short distance later there was a bench in shade.There were a lot of cyclists on the trail and a few runners and walkers.  I still had about a quarter mile back to my car when the 140 minutes ended, and I turned off my GPS and walked to the car. Just before I got to my car, I found my water bottle in the middle of the trail. Earlier, a cyclist had told me he had seen my water bottle on the trail back at 78th South, so I was looking for the bottle as I neared the car, and I was glad to get the bottle. I dumped out the water in the bottle, because it was hot, as in a hot shower, from being in the sun for two hours 20 minutes. All in all, it was a nice run/walk on a beautiful but hot day.This was a bad week for running. On Tuesday, my wife and I attended a wedding reception at the south end of the valley, almost in the Oquirrh Mountains. On Wednesday my wife and several friends were busy all day doing flowers for a wedding on Thursday morning. We were busy on Thursday from 6 am until midnight with the wedding. My wife did all of the flowers for the wedding, and I shot video of the events. There was a morning wedding, a noon-time luncheon, and the wedding reception that evening. On top of all of this, we had four grandchildren staying with us for the week, and they expected me to play games with them. I got my old Atari 800 out of a closet and set it up so they could play Atari games. On Friday I was too tired to do anything but mope around. I had 7 hours sleep each night during the week, and I felt fine this morning before I left for my run/walk. In addition to my 7 hours sleep last night, I took a one-hour nap before the run and a one-hour nap after I returned home from my run/walk. I feel fine now and am ready to go outside and finish mowing my lawn."},
{"title": "Names of Utah Streets", "date": "Friday, August 17, 2012", "text": "I've been giving the names of streets in my blog, and I thought I'd explain the names. Utah has a unique way of naming streets, and the names are confusing to people who don't know the \"system\" of naming streets.Consider the address of 1986 South 2700 East in Salt Lake City. The address tells how far the house or business is from the Mormon temple in downtown Salt Lake City. Specifically, the address is relative to the intersection of South Temple street and Main Street, which corresponds to the southeast corner of the temple. The house or business having the address given above is 19.88 blocks south and 27.00 blocks east of the temple. Each block is divided into 100 sections, so the building number of 1988 represents 19.88 blocks. The first number and the first direction (1988 South) give the position of the building within the block. The direction could be North, South, East, or West. This use of a direction number/name is common to probably all addresses throughout the US. However, the second direction number/name (2700 East) is also relative to the distance from the temple but is also the NAME of the street. Thus, 1986 South 2700 East means the building is located 19.86 blocks south of the temple on a street named 2700 East, and that street is 27 blocks east of the temple.To help people avoid confusion about street addresses, I usually write an address with the first direction abbreviated and the second direction spelled out (1986 S. 2700 East in this example). This converts the address to the more common \"style\" of a location on a street. Newer addresses, though, usually have a name of the street that is not a number and direction, such as 2305 North Valley View Way. The first number still tells the distance from the temple (23.05 blocks north of the temple) and the second part of the address is the street containing the building. In order to use the address, one needs to know the location of the street (Valley View Way). I prefer the traditional system of addresses (2305 North 5600 West) because I understand the system and know the building is 23.05 blocks north and 36.00 blocks west of the temple).In my blog posts, I'm referring to streets name that don't look like street names: 100th South (10000 South), 11400 South, 123rd South (12300 South). These streets are named after the traditional Utah system. 100th South is 100 blocks south of the temple. With the advent of GPS, one can just enter the address, what ever it might be, and the GPS gives exact directions to reach the building. I used my automobile GPS last evening to find a wedding reception of a relative.If this post isn't clear, please leave a comment, and I'll try to explain it more clearly."},
{"title": "Another great run/walk - 140 minutes", "date": "Saturday, August 11, 2012", "text": "I started at 100th South in South Jordan City and ran to 78th South in Midvale City. My wakeup heart rate was 57, higher than the 54 I had yesterday. The difference was likely due to my mowing my lawns yesterday. When I finished with the lawns, my heart was pumping fast, and I was tired. Apparently, my body hadn't fully recovered by this morning when I measured my pulse rate. I wasn't sure if I should run today or not, because when I woke up I didn't have a lot of energy. However, when I left home, I felt pretty good. I hoped to do at least 5 miles like I did on Wednesday, and maybe 6 miles. But, once I started, I just kept on going and did 7 miles! As I neared 78th South, I knew I should turn around, but the temptation to get to 78th South was great, and I kept on going.The Midvale City section of the Jordan River Parkway path ends at 78th South. However, I stood in the parking lot next to the road for a few minutes and watched walkers and cyclists come and go, and I realized there is a path under the road that continued north. I discovered that that there is a foot bridge across the river about 100 yards south of 78th, and a path from that bridge goes down and to the right, and then it goes under the street and continues northward. This is the way people are getting across 78th. I think that for my next long run, I'll drive to 78th South and park my car in the parking lot where I was standing, and then I'll backtrack to the bridge and go under the street. This will allow me to run 1.5 to 3.5 miles north on the path before I turn around. That distance will put me close to the border of Kearns City. If I can find additional parking lots along the path, I might be able to run clear to Davis County, which is north of Salt Lake City, and maybe get to the point where the Jordan River empties into the Great Salt Lake.I ran today in the mid-day heat (the high in Salt Lake City was expected to be 89 (F), but it was much hotter than that in the direct sun. There wasn't much shade on the path, and I got really hot. In addition, I was very low on water and had to ration my water on the way back. I used four bottles (cups) of water on the 3.5 miles out, and 1 bottle on the way back.  To ration my water, I took smaller sips and took them every other walking phase. I ran out of water about 1/4 mile from my car, and I walked that last quarter mile and got a big drink at a fountain before I drove home.Again, if there are people reading this who aren't sure how to get from Sandy to Midvale, take the Parkway path through the golf course. When the path ends, ignore the sign that says end of the path, and go left up to 7th West. Cross 90th at the light and go north on 7th West to about 8300 South. There are several industrial buildings along the west side of 7th West. There are two big silos immediately north of the last building, and the Parkway path begins at that point. There is a locked gate that blocks the path, but there is a narrow opening in the fence to let people go to-from the parkway path to 7th West. The opening is wide enough for bicycles to get through, but I doubt that baby strollers (at least wide ones) could get through. Narrow strollers might make it."},

It has been close to 60, so 54 is a big drop. This illustrates the effect of good sleep at night and the use of wakeup heart rate as a check on ones physical condition."},
{"title": "Today had a great run/walk for 100 minutes", "date": "Thursday, August 09, 2012", "text": "I started my workout a few minutes before 9 am. Yesterday, the temperature in Salt Lake City was 103 (F), and today was expected to be almost that hot. So, I made sure I started my workout early in the morning. During most of the workout, the sky was cloudy, and I didn't have direct sun. Although, during the last mile, the sky cleared and I had the heat from direct sun. I did 4.8 miles during my workout, with no rest stops. I felt good, had a good energy level, and really enjoyed myself. I think the big difference between this run and previous runs is sleep. I've been getting a good 7 hours sleep each night during the past week, and my body is starting to respond to the sleep. Our bodies don't respond quickly to sleep or the lack of sleep. It takes a few days for the effect of sleep or the lack of sleep to hit me. I carried 5 bottles (cups) of water in my Fuel Belt, and took a swallow each time I walked. I sweated a lot and was glad I had the water.I didn't check the temperature when I left home and when I returned, but the news broadcast said the max temperature in Salt Lake was 95. I run along the Jordan River, about 15 or so miles from Salt Lake, and the temperature is usually a few degrees cooler than the city.I took a half hour nap when I got home and then sat around for two or three hours resting. When the sun was getting low in the sky, I went outside and replaced three sprinkler popups. The popups being replaced are old ones with the filter in the bottom. The replacements are new popups with the filter in the top. I'm replacing the old ones because the filter is much easier to replace in the new ones. I have to dig a hole about 5 inches in diameter and as deep as the popup so I can replace the popup without getting dirt in the pipe while I make the change."},

I went north from 100th South to the golf course and then back to the parking lot at 100th South. Then I finished my workout with a south-bound run/walk 3/8 mile and back. During my workout today I took two breaks for a few minutes each. The first break was at 2 miles, and the second break was probably at 2.8 miles or so. It really felt nice to sit on a bench for a few minutes and rest. I weighed myself before and after the workout, and I was the same weight both times. Apparently, I drank just enough water to replace the water I lost through sweating. Each cup of water weighs about 0.5 pound.In the past I was able to get 1 mile per 8 ounces (1 cup) of water during my workout. I would take a sip each time I walked. This year, however, I'm running for shorter segments, and my walking segments come up more often. If I took a sip each walking segment, I would get less than 1 mile per cup of water. So, to reach my mile per cup, I skipped a couple of sips and took smaller sips. I did get 1 mile per cup of water.When I got home, I took a half-hour nap and then cooked oatmeal for breakfast. Now, I'm ready to go out in the yard and work on my sprinkler system some more.Later: I didn't get a lot of work done on the sprinklers. I adjusted six of them and was soaked when I finished. I went into the house and changed into dry clothes and stayed inside. In the past, up into my early 60s, I could run and do yard work in the same day. I can't do that anymore. I don't know if it's because I'm not used to the distance, or perhaps because I'm getting old. Now, on days that I run, I'm pretty tired for the rest of the day."},

I also have replaced 64 filters in newer popups. I used to be able to do a full days work in my yard and still run a 15-mile long run, but I can't do that anymore. I think that probably the biggest factor in my getting older is that I don't have the energy level that I used to have. Now, I can do a lot of yard work OR I can go running. I would like to forget the yard work and go running, but life isn't that way. I can ignore yard work for a time, but eventually the work has to be done, and procrastination usually makes the work harder on me than it would have been if I did the work sooner."},

I've been running and walking 1 minute each, but I decided last week to reduce it to 50 seconds running and walking, and that is the sequence I used today.I forgot to mention that about 10 days ago I saw a small garter snake on the path. It was about 8:30 in the morning, and the snake seemed to be sleeping in the sun. I stepped over the snake and it didn't move. I then tapped the snake lightly on its tail, and it slithered off into the bushes. Being cold blooded, the snake needed exposure to the sun to get warm, and I hated to disturb its sleep. I was worried that a cyclist would run over the snake, and I woke it up so it would \"escape\" to the safety of the bushes."},

I started running about 9 am, but it was hot during the run. There is almost no shade when I go south from the South Jordan East Pavilion, and the temperature in the direct sun was probably over 100 (F). The shade temperature as I write this is 89.I'm using my Fuel Belt with 5 bottles of water. Each bottle holds 8 oz and lasts about a mile. I'm alternating running and walking, and I take a swallow of water each time I walk.There were quite a few walkers, runners, cyclists, and skaters on the path. There was a 5-7 mph head breeze when I went out, and that helped keep me a little cooler. However, on the way back, the breeze was a tail wind and did nothing to cool me.

Google maps showed the connection to be about 8300 South. The person I talked with a few days ago said the connection wasn't far from 90th South and that I should look for a break in the fence. He said there were commercial buildings, and that the connector was immediately after the buildings. When I got to the connector, a mailbox exactly across the street said 8310. There is a locked gate that blocks the connection, but there is an opening next to the gate so people and bikes can get on or off of the connector. There is a big sign about 100 yards from the street welcoming people to the Midvale portion of the Jordan River Parkway. I went toward the river until I reached 50 minutes, and then I turned around and headed back. My goal was a medium run of 100 minutes. This was my first time to run in Midvale. I started in South Jordan City, ran through sections of West Jordan and Sandy and then into Midvale.I had noticed that after I'd gone about 30 minutes, my head started to hurt, especially around my mouth. As I continued towards the connector near 8300 South, the stiffness in my jaw got worse; it felt like my whole head was swollen and that my jaw and cheeks were in the center of the problem. After I turned around, I got back to 700 West, but I walked most of the mile back to 9000 South, because my head/jaw hurt too much for me to run. I felt weak and hungry, and I began to wonder if I would have to call my wife and have her pick me up and take me to the emergency room at a local hospital. I thought to myself that in 40 years of running, nothing like this had ever happened to me. Today was the first time this summer that I used my Fuel Belt, and I wondered if there were bacteria of some kind in the bottles. As I walked towards 9000 South, I passed a commercial building that had big rocks in front for landscaping, and I stopped for a couple of minutes and sat on one of the rocks to rest.I continued walking, and a little jogging, to 9000 South and then down 700 West to the Sandy golf course. I sat on a bench for several minutes, realizing I still had a mile to go, and I wondered how I would make it. My jaw was stiff, and I couldn't hold my head up and look ahead of me. I hung my head and looked at my feet. I left the bench and continued walking south. I don't know why, but for some reason I took my sun glasses off, and presto, the pain in my head started decreasing. Within a couple of minutes, the pain was gone, and I felt fine.  I looked at the glasses and noticed they weren't my regular glasses. They were sun glasses I got at a running Expo several years ago when I ran the Salt Lake City Half-marathon. I realized the glasses were too small for me and were putting pressure on my head. The glasses fit me when I got them and wore them during the half marathon, but they either had shrunk or my head had gotten larger, because they didn't fit me this morning. I held the glasses in my hand and ran/walked the last 3/4 mile to my car. It was a big relief to know that I wasn't getting lock jaw or something, and I enjoyed that last 3/4 mile.Note: I took 12 minutes longer than I had planned to complete the 5 miles because of the walking I did."},

When I turned around 30 minutes later, Riverside had become 7th West, and I could see the light at 90th South. On my way back, I talked with a guy and a woman who have ridden their bicycles in this area, and they said the connection back to the Jordan River Parkway isn't far from 90th South. They said to look for a break in the wire fence and a paved path going west. I didn't ask if \"not far\"  could be 7/8 mile, which is about where Google maps showed a connection. Thus, I'm not sure if the connection described by the two people this evening is the same as the connection shown on Google maps.I forgot to mention last week that I saw a Crane on a sand bank in the Jordan River. The bird was about 3/4 mile south of the tunnel under 100th South while the one I've seen in the past was about 1/4 mile north of the tunnel. In either case, it was nice to see the bird."},

The shade temperature during my run was in the low 90s (F). The direct-sun temperature was probably about 105. I did fine for the first half, but after I turned around and headed north to my car at 100th South, I suffered from the heat and thus took several two-minute sitting breaks on benches that were in shade. The path south of 100th South doesn't have much mid-day shade.Just before I started running, I talked with a man who wanted to canoe the river, and he was using his bicycle to scout for places to launch his canoe. He was using his phone to look at a map of the area, and I answered several questions about the area. He went south (same direction as me), and I didn't see him again until I was at the South Jordan East Pavilion, still going south, and he passed going north. As he passed, I asked him how it went, and he yelled back that he found some good places.I passed a man on a bicycle who was pulling a small trailer that carried his water and other things he thought he would need. Most cyclists only carry one bottle of water, but he had several bottles on his trailer. I passed him again as I was going north to my car and he was going south. He must have gone a long way north before he turned around.There are water fountains at 100th South and at the East Pavilion, and I had good drinks at both places, thus not having to carry water. However, if I continue to run at mid-day I will do better if I carry water in addition to using the fountains. After I got home, I ate some food (I run on an empty stomach, eating before I leave only a couple of handfuls of dry Cheerios and an energy bar) and took a half-hour nap. I was really tired when I got home, and I felt better after the nap."},

I waited until evening to go running, and the temperature was 65 when I left home about 8 pm. The sun was low in the sky but was still visible. By the time I finished, it was almost dark, and by the time I got home, it was dark. My wife worries when I'm running after dark, and I promised her I would be finished before it got dark.I made a mistake and ate supper about 1 1/2 hours before I ran. I thought that would be enough time for my stomach to get used to the food, but it wasn't. For the first mile, I felt weak and nauseated, but then I started to feel better, and when I turned around after 30 minutes of running, I felt fine. I had meatloaf and a cheese sandwich, and those things take more time to be digested.  I would have been better off eating a bowl of dry cereal. I think I'll take some digestive enzymes tonight to help my digestion tomorrow."},
{"title": "Ran for 90 minutes and did 4.2 miles for my long run", "date": "Saturday, July 14, 2012", "text": "I've been studying the online maps about the Jordan River in West Jordan City. The city has a trails map that shows two trails following close to the river. I decided to follow the river and see how it went under 90th South (a major street going west from I15). The river went under the street but the trail didn't. I waited until there was no traffic coming either way and then ran across 90th. I found a dirt trail following the river, so I followed that trail for not quite a mile. I was hoping the trail would take me to 83rd West or so, where there is a connector between the Jordan River Parkway and 7th West. I think the trail might have gone that far, but I turned back because the trail was getting pretty rough. I followed a sidewalk along 90th South to the golf driving range that I've seen while driving on 90th. I found the canal maintenance road that goes north, but that road stopped at 90th South and didn't follow the canal under 90th. So, my conclusion is as follows: follow the dashed yellow lines, like I did on Monday, to Riverside Drive. Go north on Riverside until it becomes 7th West. Follow 7th West north to the light at 90th. Cross 90th and continue north on 7th West. According to Google Maps, there is a connector from 7th West back to the Jordan River Parkway at about 8300 South. This is the only safe way to cross 90th South and continue North on the Parkway. Today was cooler than previous days last week. The temperature was 69 (F) when I left home and 77 when I returned. I was out earlier in the morning that I've done in previous days, and that made running a more enjoyable activity. I was back home before 11 am, and the trail had quite a lot of shade."},
{"title": "Ran/Walked for 60 minutes again", "date": "Wednesday, July 11, 2012", "text": "I ran/walked the same route I used on Monday and got to the north end of the golf course, although I was east of the course. Instead of turning back, as I did on Monday, I continued following the cement path around the golf course. The path went south until I came to an intersection. The right-path goes, I think, to the driving range that is visible from 90th South. I took the left-path to take me back to the path that goes just west of the Sandy City Pro Shop, using a narrow bridge that is just north of the Pro Shop. I then followed the Parkway path back to my car at 100th South. On my Saturday run I will take the narrow bridge and the path that goes to the driving range to see if there is a connection to the Parkway path going north towards Salt Lake City.This evening I checked Google maps to see if it showed the Parkway path going past 90th South. The Google map is several years old and doesn't show recent changes. Based on the map, I would have to follow the dashed yellow line, as I did last week, to Riverside Drive which becomes 700 West. I would follow 7000 West north to about 8300 South where the maps show a connection with the Parkway. That is a detour of almost a mile, and I'm hoping a more recent connection to the Parkway occurs in the vicinity of 90th South.I also checked the Trails map provided online by West Jordan City. That map, that is likely more recent than Google maps, shows two paths that are close to the river when they go under 90th South and continue northward. One path is an urban path, and the other path is a equestrian path. Another possibility shown by the trails map is the maintenance road that follows a canal. At about 7800 South, it is just a short distance from the maintenance road to the Jordan River Parkway.The temperature was 89 (F) when I left home and in the 70s when I returned. I started running about 8:30 PM to avoid the daytime heat. By the time I finished, the sun was down but it was still dusk. A wind came up during my last half-mile, but the wind died down about an hour after I got home. It was a head wind, which made running more difficult, but the wind helped cool me off.We had a touch of rain this morning, and the clouds kept the temperature in the mid 70s (F). However, after the storm was over and the clouds thinned out, the temperature went up to 95 at my house (probably 100 or more at the Salt Lake Airport)."},
{"title": "Did another 3 miles this evening", "date": "Tuesday, July 10, 2012", "text": "The temperature at the Salt Lake Airport peaked at 101 (F) today. The highest temperature I saw at my house was 98. My wife and I left for her walk and my run/walk about 6:30 pm. The temperature when we left was 89, and it was 81 when we returned home. This was cooler than the peak but still hot. The temperature is projected to peak in triple digits on Wednesday, and I need to get out early in the morning or wait until 7:30 to 8:00 pm to go running. Leaving at 6:30 like we did this evening meant the temperature was still high. When we got home, I noticed my hat and my t-shirt were soaked with sweat.I followed the Jordan River Parkway north to 90th South, but I couldn't find the parking lot for the trail head. I'm guessing the path goes west to the parking lot for the golf driving range that borders 90th. I'm going to check Google Maps today to see if I can find the parkway at 90th. There is a short (about 100 feet) dirt path to 90th from the point where we stopped, but that isn't the official path. While we were stopped near the dirt path, we saw three cyclists who were going east on 90th take the dirt path to the Parkway and then go south. I need to find the parking lot, so I find the point where the Parkway path crosses under 90th South and continues north.On our way back, we saw two big brown horses grazing in the pasture that borders the Parkway. Both were all brown with a white spot on their forehead, and I couldn't tell if one of them was the horse that I \"rescued\" yesterday. It's likely that one was.I got pretty tired on the way back to our car. I had about 1/4 mile left to go, and we stopped at a bench while I took a brief rest. I didn't eat much yesterday, and that likely contributed to my being tired. Also, even though I had a good drink before we left home and another drink in the parking lot at 100th South, I got pretty thirsty. I need to carry water on these hot days. I did a lot of walking during the last half-mile. Rather than run ahead of my wife, I walked with her during that last part. Usually, she walks as fast as I  run/walk, but she had decided before we left home to go slower and enjoy being outside. I'm a slow walker, and her going slower allowed me to walk with her. Her fast walk is faster than my pace for running and walking. This is true for most of the walkers - faster than me.The Sandy City golf course goes about half a mile north and south of the Pro Shop. On Saturday, when I ended up in a residential area, I noticed the golf course behind the Townhouses that were near the Pro Shop. Tonight, we were on the other side of the golf course, on the Parkway path, and the path went next to the golf course up to 90th."},

It was 82 when I left home, and about 72 when I returned. I didn't have my GPS with me, but I would guess that I went about 3.5 miles or so.I went north and found the new gate open, so I ran/walked the new path hoping to get to the parkway-head at 90th South. The asphalt in the new part of the trail had (ugly) a dashed yellow line down the middle of the path. The dashed line took me into the Sandy City Golf Course, where the line became a solid line. I followed the solid line through the golf course to a city street. The yellow line stopped at the street, and I couldn't see a continuation of the line. So, I followed the city street north until it came to a dead end at about 9100 South. A block wall separated me from the vehicles driving on 90th South. I had made a wrong turn somewhere and was not on the Parkway path. I backtracked to the golf course and decided to take a road that went west of the Pro shop instead of east of the shop, as I had done going out. This road went past the Pro shop to the path I had followed going out. I did see, though, a sign about the Parkway trail, and I realized where I had made the wrong turn. When I came across the bridge over the Jordan River, I should have made an immediate turn and gone west of the Pro Shop instead of following the solid line that went south of the Pro Shop to the city street.On the way back, I heard a clop clop and saw a big brown horse walking down the Parkway path. The horse went about 100 feet past me, and then it turned around and followed me south. There is a lot of construction going on just west of the path, but due to the late hour all of the workmen were gone. I decided to call the police and report the horse. There were several horses in a field just north of the construction, and somehow this horse had found a way to get out of the pasture and take a stroll on the Parkway path. About a minute after I finished my conversation with the police dispatcher, a white SUV drove up, and a man and a woman got out with halters to put on the horse. I decided they were the owners of the horse, and I left the horse in the care of those people and continued my run/walk back to the parking lot at 100th South. Hopefully, the horse is back in the pasture with its friends and the owners are glad to get the horse back."},

When we finished the walk, we had a picnic lunch and then drove back home. Before the walk, we watched the town of Brighton's parade. The parade consisted of two police SUV, three fire trucks, a red square MG, a three-wheeled motorcycle, several pickup trucks full of kids, an original Mini Cooper, quite a few kids and adults on bicycles, and a lot of kids and adults walking. All of the motor vehicles in the parade were full of adults and kids who threw candy to the crowds along the street. It was fun to see an old fashioned parade in a small town. No gigantic floats that took hours and hours of time to build. Just kids with crape paper in their bike wheels, loud police and firetruck sirens, trucks and cars honking, and spectators along the road yelling and cheering the folks in the parade. The people in the parade had fun being there and throwing candy to the kids, and we had fun watching them celebrate the 4th of July.Brighton is a small town of a couple hundred residents. It originally  was a mining town in the late 1800s, but now it is home of the Brighton and Solitude ski resorts. Our elevation at Silver Lake was 8700 feet, and the mountains and trees were refreshingly beautiful. The air was cooler than it was in the Salt Lake valley, and that felt great!Even though there were probably several hundred visitors to Brighton, we saw and spoke with two families we know in the valley: my wife's cousin who lives in a suburb that is next to Sale Lake City (we live further away from Salt Lake City in the south end of the valley)  and a neighbor who is a member of the same LDS congregation we attend. The cliché, its a small world, was certainly true today.My feet were sore when I got home. Not only did I walk almost three  miles, I was on my feet for a couple of hours waiting for the parade and  then watching the parade. I just woke up from a long nap, and my feet  feel fine now."},

I left home about 7:20 am so I would have lower temperatures for my running. The temperature was 74 (F) when I left home and 94 when I returned. The heat wave is expected to continue this week. Many of the folks back east have been without power for a couple of days, and I really feel for them. No power means no air conditioning, and for many folks no cooking. For some, as was the case when I lived in Massachusetts, no power means no water (I had my own well with an electric pump to bring the water into the house.There was quite a lot of shade this morning on my route, due to the low angle of the morning sun, and that was nice. I ran a comfortable LSD and completed 3.27 miles in the 60 minutes.I've been thinking that I will run 60 minutes on Wednesday and 60 minutes on Saturday. Then next week I will begin bringing the Wednesday and Saturday runs up to 100 minutes by adding 5 minutes to each run each week. When the Wednesday run reaches 100 minutes, I'll stop it at that time and continue adding 5 minutes to the Saturday run until it reaches 140 minutes. Five minute increases are slightly less than 10%. This will give me a rest run, a medium run, and a long run.The gate on the path is still locked (I expected it to be locked since it was locked Saturday evening, and workmen haven't had much time this morning to work on the path). When they closed the path, officials of West Jordan City estimated the path would open approximately on June 30. Today is July 2, so the path should be open any day now. While I was at the closed gate, a lady came up the path on her bike. She said her husband had gone to 90th South and followed the path south. I don't know how far south he came, but he told his wife the path went past the Pro shop at the golf course, which isn't far from the locked gate. So, it does look like the path is almost completed. I had guessed that the path would follow the maintenance road up to 90th South, but it looks like I'm wrong and that the path goes through the golf course."},

I wasn't in the best of shape for the race.It was a beautiful morning for a race. The race started at 6:30 am, before the sun was up. I was cold while walking around, but as soon as the race started I warmed up and was fine. I alternated running and walking, running for 1:30 and walking for 0:20. After about half a mile I reduced my running to 1:10 and increased my walking to 0:50, and I kept that ratio for most of the race. There were a few times that I took more time for walking to give myself extra rest.There were about 130 runners in the race. I started towards the end of the pack and quickly found myself last. There were two girls in front of me who were alternating running and walking, and I kept up with them for about half a mile, and then they were gone. I doubt that they went faster; it's likely that I went slower. There was a woman in front of me who was also alternating running and walking, and I kept up with her for another mile, and then she was gone, too. I finished the race in 52:46. My PB made 6 months ago was 47:28, and I missed that by 5:18. The good news is that I only missed my age grading score by 2:57.

No participation medals were given out.I've been focusing on distance rather than speed, so I'm not surprised or sad that I was slower today than I was a year ago. As I get older, I'm finding it harder to be faster. Also, my problem with the in-vein filter that quit working in 2009 and caused blood clots has caused me to be slower. I'm just glad to be alive and able to run at my own speed. I will continue focusing on distance rather than speed, because distance is more important to me than speed."},

I did 2.5 miles today.I forgot both my timer and my GPS, so I counted steps in the running and walking phases of my workout: 50 or so steps running and 30 or so steps walking. Those numbers are the times my left foot hit the ground not the actual steps from both feet. I used my wrist watch to measure the total time spent in the workout. I'm really grateful for the new water fountain at 100th South. I'm using that source instead of carrying my own water. However, due to the heat, I'll probably start carrying my own water in addition to using that fountain and the fountain at the East Pavilion."},

When ever he slowed a bit and I passed him, I would say, \"Ha ha, I passed you\", or something similar. With a burst of speed he would reply, \"Not for long\". We went a total of about 2.8 miles. In the meantime, my wife and our two-year-old grandson did about a mile, and then the grandson played in the playground at the East Pavilion until the other grandson and I returned.It was a great day to be outside.

We had planned to hike to Lake Mary, but the snow from last night was still on the ground and the trail was muddy. We went back to the Salt Lake valley and hiked a trail that rings the valley. We only went about 1.25 miles, but the trail went up and down hills; we had a good aerobic workout during our hike. As I'm getting older, I'm not as limber as I was in my younger years, and I had a problem going up and down the hills on the rocky and steep path. Everybody went ahead of me, and I caught up with them on the level parts. It was really a nice day -- pleasant temperature and not much wind. After our hike, the kids played on slides in the recreational area that is at the trail head."},

The temperature was in the low 60s (F), and there was a pretty strong wind that made running against the wind kinda hard.  I ran today instead of tomorrow because my daughter and her children are coming for a Memorial Day visit, and I wanted to get my running in before they arrived."},

I ran the new path on Monday, and it joins a maintenance road for a canal, and I think (hope) the maintenance road will go to 90th South and connect with the Parkway path going north. I was disappointed this morning when I reached the 0.75 mile mark on the path and found that the new path that I ran on Monday is blocked off by a wire fence. There are horses that graze in a field on the other side of the wire fence. A new fence is being installed to separate the Parkway path from that field, and the Parkway path is blocked to keep the horses from \"getting away\" while the new fence is being built. Steel poles for the new fence were installed yesterday. Hopefully, the wire fencing will be installed in the next day or so. As I mentioned in my post on Monday, the new path is still dirt and needs asphalt. I'm guessing that everything will be completed and the new path opened to the public during the next two weeks.Today was a great day for being outside. A cold front is passing through northern Utah, and the shade temperature was 59 (F) when I left home and 65 when I returned. There was a slight breeze that did not present a problem to my running.

However, when I got to the \"normal\" turn-around point 3/4 mile from the parking lot, I discovered that the barrier across the path had been removed and that the path was being extended northward. The path has been graded and roadbase placed and compressed on the path. All that remains is to lay asphalt on the path.The dirt path extends for about 100 yards north and dead ends at a path that connects tee #3 with the rest of the golf course that is on the Sandy City side of the river. I think that tee #3 is the only tee on the West Jordan side of the river. There are two bridges to be traversed before reaching the main golf course. The first bridge is across an irrigation canal that takes water from the river at a point that was about 50 yards from the place where the path used to dead end. The second bridge is across the Jordan River and the path goes into the golf course.I went across the first bridge and started to go north on the maintenance road that follows the canal. I went about 100 yards and then turned around because I didn't have time to continue northward and still be back at the parking lot after a total of 46 minutes running. I went across the second bridge and looked at the golf course, and then I went south back to the parking lot."},

Actually, the change that I need to make is getting to bed an hour earlier. I'm averaging about 6-61/2 hours with a nap in the afternoon.I ran/walked from the South Jordan East Pavilion to the Draper pavilion at 12300 South. I had a good drink of water before I left the East Pavilion, and another good drink at the Draper pavilion which was my turn-around point. I felt fine on the way down but got tired on the way back and took a couple of brief rest stops. The good news is that I wasn't tired from the running and walking. Alternating the two means that I had brief rest walks after brief spurts of running. I was tired from the time on my feet which equates to distance. A few weeks ago I was doing 6 -7 miles for my long run, and I reduced my distance to see if that made a difference in the swelling in my feet. It didn't, so I'm working myself back to the longer distance. In about a month I'll be back to the 6-7 miles for my long workouts.I think getting too much Sodium in my diet is the biggest factor in the swelling. I didn't realize how much salt I was eating. I'm reducing the salt in my diet, and my weight has gone down about 10 pounds (water weight)."},

After the break I felt fine from there back to my car (about 1.33 miles). I drank water at home and again at the East Pavilion before I started running, but I could have used water on the way back.

My running pace was about the same as in past weeks, but my walking pace was a bit faster than in past weeks. I think my going to shorter running and walking phases has helped me increase my total time during the workouts this week, but I still got tired as I neared the end of the workout today. I will need to increase my total times in small increments to get back to the total times I had a month ago.I've been thinking about my getting old and wondering if I really will make it to 100. If I do, I hope to still be running. I didn't notice much change up through age 72 in my ability to run and to recover, but since then I've noticed that I get tired sooner and have a more difficult time doing longer distances. I still run for enjoyment, and I do enjoy my runs.The Jordan River is still low. I see a lot of sand banks that usually would be under water this time of year, and I'm wondering if the Spring runoff is smaller than they expected.

That is a good sign, because I mowed my lawns yesterday and was pretty tired when I finished. I read yesterday a comment from Jeff Galloway (inventor of the run/walk method that I'm using) that the optimum amount of running and walking is 30 seconds each. I tried that today. I did 0:30/0:30 for the whole run. Because I was running shorter segments, I intentionally ran faster than I've been running. My time going out was a bit faster than I've been doing, and my time coming back was a bit slower.  I think I'll use that ratio again on Saturday but go a bit slower. The purpose of walk breaks is to get rested from the running, thus being able to run a longer distance for the run, but I went too fast today and the walking wasn't long enough to provide the rest I needed.

They were past the end of the golf course and were over a fence and in a field. That field has been separated from the Parkway by a wire fence, but one of the fence posts is broken and the wire fence is on the ground, making it easy for me to go into the field. If the golf balls belong to the driving range, I throw them back onto the course. Otherwise, I keep them. I have almost two dozen golf balls that I've found in past runs.

Not a lot of walkers, runners, cyclists, skate boarders, etc.My grandson and I saw a garter snake. It was on the path, and then it slithered off the path and through some grass and dirt. The snake was about the diameter of my little finger and maybe 2-3 feet long. Watching the snake gave me the opportunity to explain to my grandson that some snakes are dangerous and some are harmless. My grandson asked what garter snakes ate, and I said, \"insects\". However, Wikipedia says, \"Their diet consists of almost any creature that they are capable of overpowering: slugs, earthworms, leeches, lizards, amphibians, birds, fish, toads and rodents\". I forgot that snakes can open their mouths very wide and eat animals larger in diameter than they are. The following picture is from the web.We had great Spring weather today. A 5 mph or so wind, sunny skies, clear air, and temperatures in the mid to high 60s (F)."},

I was slower in returning, because I still had about half a mile when my time expired, and I just walked that last half-a mile.

I massaged them several times during the night and the left leg was noticeably smaller when I finished. The swelling had returned, though, during the morning before I went running. My weight, when I first woke up, was down about two pounds. My wakeup heart rate was way down to 52.

Rather than run in the morning like I should be doing, I waited until late afternoon. I only ran 1.5 miles before I gave up and went home. My problem was that I ate lunch about an hour before I went running, and I had a hard time breathing while I was out. Eating that close to my run was a dumb thing to do. I've made that mistake many times in the past, and one would think I would have learned my lesson about eating and running. I need at least two hours between a good meal and my running. I can eat a small amount of easy digestible food before I run, such as a handful of Cheerios or a piece of dry toast shortly before I run, but not much more than that. Another mistake that I made yesterday, which actually led to my eating too much for lunch, was that I skipped breakfast.The sky during my run was overcast, but there was no noticeable wind. The temperature was in the mid 40s (F).Both of my legs are swelling during the day, and I've decided to cut my distance down a bit to see if that helps reduce the swelling. Most of my runs this Spring and probably Summer and Fall will be 2-3 miles, with occasional jaunts of 5 miles. I'm not too worried about the swelling, because it does significantly decrease during the night. This swelling is a new thing that started about a month ago. One nice thing that my reduced distance will allow me to do is to run longer before I walk. I'm currently running 3 minutes, and I'll slowly increase that up to 5 or 6 minutes."},

For several years I saw a duck that was completely white and was larger than a Mallard, but I haven't seen that duck for a year or so.

I slowly gained on her, and I caught up with her just before our turn-around point at 1 mile. On the way back, I slowed my running just a bit so we would be together during the mile back to our car. It was late afternoon when we went out, and the sun was low enough in the sky that it was behind clouds. The temperature was in the high 40s (F) during the workout, and once we were warmed up, we felt fine.I only had 4 1/2 hours of sleep Saturday night (7 hours last night), so my energy level was low during our workout today. I taught a class in church yesterday morning, and when I teach I often wake up early and don't get a full night's sleep due to anxiety about the class. My wake up heart rate was 58 this morning, but it will take me at least a week of good sleep to get my energy level back to normal levels. I'll be teaching this class (marriage and family relations) every other week for another month, so my running will be probably be reduced during the coming month. By mid March we'll be through with the sequence of 8 classes, and my wife and I won't teach again until new people are invited to attend the class.While driving to the Parkway, my wife looked in her bird-book and identified the black birds with white beaks as American Coots.

This meant that I went under the new bridge at 11400 South, and that gave me a better view of the Jordan River. The river has increased its level since December. In fact, the water level today was only about 8-10 inches below the peak level last summer. The water level in the river is controlled by pumps at the north end of Utah Lake, and for some reason they are releasing more water into the river than they have in the past (extra water was released last year, too, in February. My guess is that the powers-that-be are lowering the level in the lake to make room for extra water that will flow into the lake during our Spring floods."},

I do better when I run in the mornings before I eat breakfast or in the late afternoon with an earlier lunch. Our bodies need extra oxygen after we've eaten, and they also need extra oxygen when we run. Younger folks can likely provide enough oxygen for both activities, but we older runners need to space the two activities out such that we have enough oxygen for both activities.The water in the Jordan River is higher than it has been. The same thing happened last year. Usually water is released from Utah Lake in April or May. Last year it was in February, and this year it was in January. This is a good sign, though. It means that Utah Lake has normal or above amounts of water, and that may imply that the reservoirs in the mountains have normal or above amounts of water."},

Today I felt fine after 60 minutes of faster walking.I had quite a few stitches after my skin cancer surgery last week. Most of the stitches have dissolved, and the sutures are healing. During the day I've been putting vitamin E oil on the sutures to help them heal. When I go to bed, I put Calendula ointment on the sutures to keep the sutures moist and to help them heal."},

We parked by the fishing ponds in South Jordan and walked south for half an hour and then returned. This took us across a foot-bridge next to the new bridge at 11400 South and down the Parkway path on the Draper City side of the Jordan River. My wife had never walked that part of the path, and this gave her a new experience.I'll begin running again on Monday. I'll continue with my 3 minutes of running and 40 seconds of jogging. To help me regain my distance, on Monday I'll only do one mile. On Wednesday I'll do two miles, and on Saturday I'll do three miles. During the next week, I'll work up to five miles, and on the week after that I'll see if I can do my normal 3, 5, 7 (15) miles for the week. Younger folks would go right back to the 15-mile weeks their first week of running, but at my age I'm taking it slower so I don't abuse my body."},

I ran south from 100th South for 1 hour 10 minutes and then returned. There was a brisk 10-15 mph head during my run out, and I looked forward to having the wind as a tail wind during my return. However, as often happens, the wind decreased in amplitude, and by the time I turned around, the wind was almost gone. During my return I had a few gusts pushing me, but not the steady wind that I experienced going out. The wind did pick up after I finished my run, and I was glad I had gotten out earlier than I usually do for my run.For most of the run I ran for three minutes and walked for 40 seconds. For a couple of miles in the middle of my run, I ran for about 2 minutes 45 seconds and walked for about 55 seconds. My only rest stop was a couple of minutes at the 6 mile marker. I started my run at 10:55 am, and I was glad I was out early, because during my run I could see dark storm clouds gathering over the Wasatch Mountains.

During the morning before my run there were a few snow flakes falling, but during the afternoon when I ran, the sky was partly cloudy. The temperature was in the low 30s (F) when I started and about 29 when I finished. There was a north wind of about 5-10 mph. This wind was a tailwind  during the first half of my run and a headwind during the last half. The wind felt cold. The 10 mph gusts made the equivalent temperature be about 21. During the run, the sun was behind dark clouds as well as in open sky, and I felt the welcome heat when the sun was in the open. During the last two miles, my legs started getting tired, and I ran for shorter segments and walked for longer segments. It took me 50 minutes to run 3 miles going south and 58 minutes to run the same distance coming back. The time coming back was longer due to my doing more walking. I wore my usual 3 layers and felt fine after I warmed up, although I didn't have gloves and my fingers were cold during the run. On the way back I put my hands in the pockets of my wind breaker while I ran and walked, and that helped my fingers a bit. I didn't have a hat, though, and that probably contributed to more heat-loss from my head.All things considered, it was a nice run.

{"title": "Had a great medium run of 87 minutes", "date": "Thursday, December 15, 2011", "text": "My wakeup heart rate was 57. I had almost 8 hours sleep last night, and I felt fine today. The sky was cloudy, and when I left home the temperature was in the low 30s (F) and was in the mid 20s when I returned just as it was getting dark.I forgot both my GPS and my two-phase timer, so I used my watch to measure the overall time of the run, and I counted steps to alternate running with walking. My pace was approximately 130 steps per minute, so by counting the number of times my left foot hit the ground, I had a good estimate of the time to complete 110 seconds. When I got to 110, I kept on running. When I got to 180, I kept on running, and when I got to 240 I stopped for about 45-50 left-foot steps of walking. I was surprised I ran for about 4 minutes without walking. That's double what I've been doing. I thought that this amount of running wouldn't last long, but it lasted for the whole run of 87 minutes (about 5.1 miles). I was also running a bit faster than I've been doing, but I kept my speed down so my legs and body would last the four minutes.I wore 3 layers, and when I first started running, I felt cold, but after half a mile I started to warm up, and by 1 mile I felt fine. Well, I felt fine except for my fingers. I was wearing light cotton gloves, and my fingers were cold for most of the run.  I kept moving my fingers to try to generate some heat in them due to movement. I think that I'll have to wear my camping mittens that consist of about 1/4 inch of tightly woven wool and a nylon shell. I used them when I was camping in below 0 temperatures in Massachusetts with my scouts, and my fingers never got cold even though I was just walking around. When a person runs, their body diverts blood from hands and feet to the body-core, resulting in cold fingers. However, my experience when I was younger was that after about 2 miles, my fingers got warm. However, as I gotten older, I've discovered that my fingers don't get warmer as I run. Apparently, my blood circulation isn't as good now as it was 30 years ago. Another factor is that 30 years ago, I was running about twice as fast as I'm now running, and I didn't do any walking like I'm doing now. By going faster my body generated more heat. It was common for me, back then, to have sweatcicles hanging the back of my hair when I ran even though the temperature was around 0.In past posts, I've mentioned that the Jordan River is washing away dirt, resulting in the Jordan River path being unsafe for about 100 feet. During my run this afternoon, I noticed that Draper City is repairing the eroded path. Quite a few truck loads of dirt have been used to fill in several years of erosion. In addition, the city is lining a few hundred feet of the river bank with large rocks. I hope the large rocks are sufficient to stop erosion; otherwise, the new dirt will wash away next summer when the height of the river rises."},

I did slow down, and I felt better. I had hoped to run for 140 minutes (my long run), but after I had gone 2.6 miles, I recognized I was tired, and I turned around and headed back. On the way back, I jogged less and walked more to give my body more rest. I also took one brief rest stop on the way back.

I didn't check the temperature when I got home, but it was likely about 28.I enjoy running at dusk, because the river is full of ducks bedding down for the night, and flocks of geese are flying low looking for a pond to spend the night. I don't know why, but the geese don't bed down on the river; they seem to like ponds and/or lakes. The lights of nearby houses and businesses glow in the darkness. Just before it gets dark, the Oquirrh Mountains glow as if there was a bright light behind them. I saw 6 quail running down the path in front of me. They were all about the same size and were probably born in the Spring.For the past month, I've felt stronger and have run faster than in the past. I'm still running 100 seconds and walking 40 seconds. After I finished the run tonight, I set my timer for 110 seconds running and 40 seconds walking. It has been almost three years since the filter in my vein quit working and I had blood clots in my legs. I've slowly been getting stronger and have run longer before I walk, and the improvement during the past month has been wonderful. I'm feeling like a \"real\" runner instead of a \"plodder\". I was so slow it was common for walkers to pass me. Now, maybe I can keep up with the walkers :) Before the blood clot attack, I would run half a mile and take a 30 second walking break. My typical LSD pace was 10:30 - 11:00. Now, the pace during my running segment is about 14-16 minutes. Patience is a great virtue, and I'm slowly getting stronger.When I ran on Monday, the Jordan River was still at its summer high, and the tunnel under 106th South was still flooded. But when I ran today, the river was down to its winter level, and the tunnel was clear of water and the moss and algae that had collected had been removed. The water level in the river is controlled by a gate in the north end of the Utah Lake and by pumps. The water level has been high for about 9 months, implying the gate keepers were trying to remove a lot of water from the lake. Apparently, the level of the lake is now below flood stage, and the gate was mostly closed, causing the level in the river to go down. It will be interesting to see if the gate will be opened in February as it was last Spring, or in May as it has been historically."},

{"title": "Draper City (Utah) Trying to Combat Erosion From the Jordan River", "date": "Saturday, November 19, 2011", "text": "Several years ago, erosion from the Jordan River washed out the dirt under a short section of the Parkway trail on the Draper City side of the river. The river had actually washed out dirt under the asphalt of the trail. The trail was closed to traffic and a temporary path was made around the damaged area. That path was eventually paved and became a permanent part of the Parkway.A couple of weeks ago, I walked to the edge of the river and looked at the area that had been washed out. Additional erosion had taken place, and I thought the trail would need repair.During my Wednesday run of last week, I found out that the section of the trail had been blocked to traffic for a distance of about 20-30 feet. The Parks department of Draper City had finally become aware of the damage to the ground under the Parkway. I assume repairs of some kind will be made. Similar erosion in South Jordan City has taken place in past years, and South Jordan elected to line the river bank in appropriate places with large rocks. It's too bad that Draper City didn't do that several years ago. It will be interesting to see what solution the engineers at Draper City come up with.While I was at the edge of the river last week, I noticed three long PVC pipes going from the river bank into the river. The tips of the pipes have something black on the ends of the pipes, but the black objects were under water and I couldn't get a good look at them. The pipes were being bent by the swift current of the river, and I'm guessing the black objects are sensors of some kind to measure the velocity of the water. Once the engineers know how fast the river is flowing and how much water is flowing past the river bank, they can come up with a scheme to protect the bank from further erosion. The pipes were were spaced about 20 feet apart in the river bank immediately before the eroded part.I also noticed that Draper has closed the trail just before it goes under the bridge at 12300 South. That section of the trail is flooded by the river. In the past there was a sign that said \"Swift Water\", and I assume they closed the trail to protect the city from liability if someone goes into the river and is caught by the swift current."},

It was a good run. I completed 3.3 miles in the 60 minutes for my rest run. As I always do, I let my body decide how fast to go. I ran 80 seconds and walked 40 seconds, and I could tell I was going faster than I usually do. However, at the end of a mile I could tell I was getting tired, so I walked for 160 seconds instead of 40 seconds and then continued my normal sequence of running and walking. I did the same thing at the end of two miles, and I finished feeling pretty good.It takes me a couple of miles to warm up, and I felt cold for the first two miles, especially when I was going north for the first half-mile. If I had gone a little slower, I probably could have done 120 seconds (about 5.5 miles), but running a bit faster for a shorter distance was OK. If I feel fine on Wednesday, I'll do the 5+ miles.Today is supposed to be a sunny day, but a storm is coming from the east, and the Wasatch mountains east of the Salt Lake valley are almost completely covered with clouds. There were times during my run when the sun came out from the clouds, and the extra warmth felt good. The air-temperature was about 40 (F), but the windchill made it seem colder. We may have snow showers tonight."},

We had about 3 inches of light snow last night, so I waited until early afternoon to go running, thus giving the sun time to melt the snow on the Parkway path. When I went running the path was clear of snow and dry. There was, though, a cold north breeze of 5 mph blowing. I didn't notice the wind on my way out, because it was a tail-wind, but on the way back it was a head-wind and my face felt cold. The air temperature was in the high 30s. My body felt warm due to the 3 layers I wore, but my face, as I just said, felt cold.I only passed one runner, but I did pass half-a-dozen or so walkers. No cyclists, which is unusual, because cyclists seem to always be on the path. There was about an inch of snow on the grass and bushes, and the snow gave a nice \"winter\" look to things. I always like the first few snow storms of the year, because the snow is beautiful to see, but come January I'm ready for Spring.My three layers were about right for an old man who runs slow. I felt a bit cold during the first two miles, while my body warmed up, and I felt comfortable for the rest of the run -- except for my hands. I didn't wear gloves, and I kept my hands tucked in the sleeves of my nylon windbreaker. In deciding how many layers to wear, you can put more layers on such that you feel comfortable in the beginning but too warm later on, or you can put fewer layers on such that you feel a bit cold in the beginning and comfortable later on. This is an individual choice -- there is no right or wrong about it. I prefer wearing fewer layers."},

There was a 5-10 mph head wind during the first half of my run, and that might have contributed to my being tired. I think, though, that the main reason for my being tired is the lack of sleep I had for a couple of weeks.

The sky was overcast with a few sprinkles. Rain showers were forecast, but they didn't materialize. Utah County, south of Salt Lake County, did have rain.

So, I'll continue getting to bed earlier and give mother nature more time to give rest to my body. After my body is rested, the wake up heart rate will come down. Apparently, a tired body needs more oxygen, hence a faster wakeup heart rate.With the advent of cold weather, the ducks in the Jordan River are returning to the parking area at 10oth South, hoping people will take pity on them and feed them.

I found myself in the middle of the runners. There were runners everywhere. I noticed that most of those running the race were younger, thinner persons, but I did see a few older runners. I saw two or three really heavy persons. They were walking, and I hoped they walked the whole marathon (or half marathon), because they didn't look like they were in shape for either 26.2 or 13.1 miles. I saw one guy who looked like he was really in pain. He was a younger guy and was thin, but the look on his face indicated he was suffering. When I passed him, he was trying to stretch his legs, and when he looked at me, his face said \"help, I'm in pain\". I'll never know, but it would be interesting to know what type of training he has been doing. Most of the runners looked like they were doing OK. Quite a few of them smiled as they passed me, and some of them recognized me as an old person and said, \"Keep it up\". There was also a kids race, and I passed quite a few families doing that race. One girl, about 5 or 6 was running as fast as she could, and she kept looking back at her family. She had a big grin on her face that indicated she was proud to be running faster than her parents.I'm glad to see a marathon and a half-marathon come to South Jordan.

{"title": "The best run/walk I've had in 3 years", "date": "Wednesday, October 05, 2011", "text": "I had a great 100 minute medium run this morning. I completed 6 miles in the 100 minutes. Typically, I've done about 5.2 miles in that time, and a few times when I was tired I only did 4.8 miles. This illustrates why I like running or walking for time rather than for distance. When I'm tired, I do less distance and when I feel great, I do more distance -- all for the same time.My wakeup heart rate was 51, the lowest it's been since I had blood clots three years ago. I started from 100th South and planned to run back and forth for 100 minutes, but when I got to the bridge at 106th South, the water was almost gone, and I kept on going south until I reached 50 minutes. I then turned around and returned to 100th South. When I reached the parking lot, I still had four minutes left in my run, and I kept on going north until I reached 100 minutes. I then stopped and walked back to my car, the walk being my cool-down.After I had gone about 0.75 mile, it started to sprinkle. I could tell from the dark sky that rain was coming. The rain did come, although it was a light rain, and it lasted for most of my run. There was a lot of wind, with gusts about 20-25 mph. The wind was from the south and was a head-wind until I turned around. Even with that head-wind, I was able to keep a relatively good pace using my 1:20 running and 0:40 walking segments. When I turned around, the wind was a good tail-wind, and I had to slow down my efforts a bit to keep from going faster than I wanted to. With about a mile and a half left, the wind and the rain stopped. However, half a mile later, the light rain started again, but the wind didn't come back. I kinda missed having that tail-wind.When I left home, the sky was completely overcast, and the clouds covered the tops of the mountains east of the valley. The temperature when I left was 61 (F). I knew it would be colder than it has been, and I wore my long-sleeved Pearl iZUMi technical shirt. I only had that one layer, but I was glad it had long sleeves. While I ran south I was facing the wind. I could feel the rain drops on my chest (they felt like cool spots), but my back felt warm and nice, even though it was wet. When I turned around and was running with the wind, my chest felt warm and nice, and I felt the cool spots on my back. I was glad I wasn't wearing a cotton shirt; it would have been soaked, heavy, and clinging to my body. The technical shirt felt light, even though it was wet, and it was blowing in the wind. Temperatures in the 50s and 60s with a wet T-shirt and a brisk wind  blowing are ideal conditions for hypothermia, but I felt warm and nice  during the run.I will be doing my long run (140 minutes) on Friday instead of on Saturday, due to a Halloween party we are having for our grandkids. If I feel as good on Friday as I felt this morning, I'll probably do 8 miles instead of the 7.1 or 7.2 miles that I've been doing.The Jordan River still has a relatively lot of water, but the level is down from its peak in the summer. As I passed under 114th South, I noticed there was still water next to the pillars that support the bridge. At its peak during the summer, the river overflowed the path under the bridge, and I estimated as I passed the pillars that the level has dropped about 3 feet from its peak. The level will continue dropping as we go into winter, but next spring the level will start to rise. Water from Utah Lake enters the Jordan River via a large \"gate\" at the start of the river. The gate keepers increase the flow in the Jordan River during the spring in an attempt to lower the level in Utah Lake and thus give the lake more capacity to absorb the spring runoff of water from the winter snow without flooding homes near the lake."},

The tree is loaded with apples, and I'll eat a couple each time I pass the tree. The tree, I assume, belonged to the farmer who owned the land. However, when South Jordan City got the strip of land that now contains the Parkway path, the tree ended up on the Parkway side of the fence.I used a run/walk ratio of 1:20 running and 0:40 walking.

{"title": "Set a new PB for 5K this morning", "date": "Saturday, September 24, 2011", "text": "I ran the 5K this morning. The race was sponsored by the Pirates  Swim Club, the group that is giving swimming lessons to my grandson. I  ran the 5K as my way of supporting my grandson in his swimming, and  maybe as he gets older in his running.A year ago I ran it in 48:02, and I considered that time a new PB since I'm running much slower due to blood clots I had two years ago.  This time I finished the race in 47:28, just barely a new PB.The course had a gradual downhill part followed by a gradual  uphill part, and then down hill again. After a flat part, the course  went uphill again to the finish. The change in elevation was only about  90 feet, but it seemed like a lot more due to the length of the climb. During the first part of the race, I didn't take any walking breaks, and  my pace was 13+. During the middle part, my speed slowed down because  of the uphill grade and my taking more walking breaks. During the  rest of the middle part, I didn't take any walking breaks, but my speed  went down to 15+ because I was getting tired, and my running speed stayed in that range until I reached the last part, which was uphill; I took more walking breaks during that part.My  mile splits are 14:28, 15:51, and 16:37. You can see the effects of the  hills in slowing me down. The good news is that I didn't take very many walking  breaks, indicating that my body is getting stronger. My legs, though, got  awfully tired. I had hoped to pick up my pace during the last 100 yards  and finish in a \"blaze of glory\". Instead, I walked and slowly jogged to  the finish.While waiting for the race to begin, I talked with a  lady who was there with her daughter and her dog. I commented that they  should pin a number on the dog. They laughed, but the dog didn't get  her number.... During the race there were two girls walking in front of me, and I  followed them for about half the course. As we started downhill again, I  caught up with them and commented to them that they were walking almost  as fast as I was running. One said, \"Not anymore, you just passed us\". I  replied, \"Yes, but it's downhill\".The top three runners (male  and female) received ribbons and some prizes. The rest of us just got a  big thank you from the organizers.  After the ribbons were given out,  prizes were given via tags drawn from a box. There were enough prizes that almost every runner got something. I received a backpack that  will make a nice gift to a grandchild. When I walked up to get the  backpack, the lady giving out the prizes told the group that I was the  first to register this morning. After receiving the backpack, I said to  her \"First here and the last to finish\" (there were some walkers behind  me, though).It was a fun race. I like small, local races because  they are fun and I usually know people there. In this case, I didn't  know anyone since the race was in a different town, but my grandson  knows the race organizers, and my son knows some of the runners and  walkers.Oh yes, I'm so slow that even that dog beat me :)This picture was taken by my wife as I crossed the finish line.I calculated my age grading for this race. Age grading removes age  from the \"picture\" so we can get a better idea of our performance for  our actual age. Here are my age grades for two years, the second being  after my blood clots that occurred two years ago.My age 46, 17:44, 72.73% Year 1982My age 75, 32:19, 39.92% Year 2011The  first number (after my age) is the time a runner would finish who was  25 but in the same condition for his age that I was for my age. The next  number (a percentage) shows how close I was to reaching the world  record for my age.Now, we can see the help that age grading  gives us. I calculated my age grading for an assumed age of 76 and an assumed  time of 26:31. Guess what, my runner-friend at age 25 would have a time  of 17:44 for both ages. That is, a 5K time of 26:31 at age 76 is the  same as a time of 19:48 at age 46, even though 26:31 is no way near a PB  of 19:47. Age grading allows me to compare times over a large time-span,  in this case 29 years. Concerning my performance this morning, I'm  about 21 minutes away from an all-time PB, taking my age into  consideration. Rather than thinking I have to reach a time of 19:47 to  set an all-time PB, I only have to reach a time of 26:31. Now, my  performance this morning doesn't seem so bad, after all :)As a side note: I've  spoken of having blood clots two years ago. Actually, the blood clots  were a side-effect. The real problem was a filter the doctors put in my  vein after an auto accident in 2004. For about 4 years I had a great  time running. Then in January 2009, the filter quit working, and it  blocked the blood circulation in that vein. I went from a 7-mile run on  Saturday to a 100-foot walk on Monday. New veins have grown around the  filter, but my performance is still way below what it was a few years  ago.  But, that's OK. I'm still alive and still running, and it's a  great life!"},

I'll be sure and have my GPS with me so I can monitor my pace. One mistake is to go out too fast during the first mile, and I hope my GPS will help me keep to a lower speed during that mile.Today was another beautiful day with shade temps in the mid 80s. I started running about 4 pm, and there was quite a lot of shade due to the time of the day that I was out.The path under the 10600 South bridge is still flooded, and the pump isn't removing much water from the path."},
{"title": "Time to rest for the 5K on Saturday", "date": "Monday, September 19, 2011", "text": "I decided to run the 5K on Saturday. The race is sponsored by the swimming club at Magna High School. My 10-year old grandson is taking swimming lessons from the club. Today I ran two miles, going from 10000 South to 10600 South and back. The shade temperature was in the mid 80s (F), and it was a pleasant day. I didn't go particularly fast and just enjoyed myself. My purpose in the run was to loosen up. If I ran fast and hard this week, my performance wouldn't improve, because our bodies take more time than a week to adjust to stress. Running fast and hard would tire me and likely hurt my performance in the race."},

I only had 6 hours of sleep last night, and I felt tired when I got up. However, I felt OK during the morning, and I started my long run about noon. I reached 7 miles after 2 hours and about 15 minutes. Rather than run the last 5 minutes to reach my time-goal of 140 minutes, I hopped in the car having met my distance goal for my long run. The shade temperature during the run/walk was in the low 70s (F). Considering the lack of  sleep I've had during the past few days, I did pretty good this morning. Last night I was reading a book about the Mormon pioneers who came to Utah in the Martin Handcart Company. My great grandfather, Francis Webster, was with that group. The book was so interesting that I kept reading and reading, and all of a sudden I realized it was 1 am, and I put the book down and went to bed.I didn't carry any water with me this morning, because the temperature is cooler and I'm doing less sweating. I took a big drink of water at home before I left and another big drink at the East Pavilion before I started my run. I took a small drink at the playground in Draper (small stream coming out of the faucet), and I took another big drink when I finished my run. There was a 10K this morning, and my run overlapped with the race runners for about half a mile. As they passed me, I told all of the runners, \"You're looking good!\" The race didn't start or end in the East Pavilion in South Jordan (where I parked), so I don't know what group sponsored the race.The path under the bridge for 10600 South is still flooded (In the past, I've referred to the path under a bridge as a tunnel, because the one for 10000 South is an actual tunnel. The the other ones, though, are paths under the bridge at such and such a street.This was another good week for running. I'm considering running a 5K next Saturday. The race is sponsored by my grandson's swimming team. If I do run the race, I'll take it easy during the week. I ran the race a year ago and completed in in 48 minutes. I'll be happy with anything faster than that."},

I've been getting more sleep the past few days, and that has helped lower my wakeup heart rate and raise my energy level. I was late getting out this morning (about noon), but the air was still cool when I started. But, by the time I was in the last mile, the air was hot, the direct sun was hot, and I started to feel the effects of the heat. I felt weak like I wanted to pass out, and I started to wobble as I moved. I found a bench in the shade, and I took a 5-minute rest. I drank extra water as I rested. When I started running, I felt great, like I had at the beginning of the run, and I felt that way for the rest of the run. The shade temperature was in the mid 80s (F), not as hot as it was in July but hot enough.... I wear a wide brimmed hat when I run to shade my head and neck and hopefully reduce the number of skin cancers that I get. I've noticed that the city of South Jordan is using a big shovel to did big holes not far from the parking lot at 100th South. After I finished my run, I walked to a group of workmen and asked what was going on. One of them said the city was preparing a wetlands that will have a walking path around it. South Jordan is doing a lot to beautify the Parkway. When the walking path is finished, I'll be able to run the path and get a different view of things.On Monday of this week I changed the ratio of my running and walking. I'm now running for 1 minute 10 seconds and walking for 50 seconds. So far, my body is handling the extra running and reduced walking. I'm keeping the sum of the two times to be 2 minutes. However, when the walking gets down to 30 seconds, I'll freeze it at that point for a while as I continue to increase my running. Each change is only a few seconds, small changes so my body can more easily adjust to the changes.For the past couple of weeks, the tunnel under 106th South has been dry, but the path through the tunnel was covered with water today when I reached it. I had planned to go south for 50 minutes and then return to my car, and I had to change my plans and just run north of 106th. Younger runners get around the water by walking or running on a concrete wall that borders the river. I don't do that, because I don't have good balance and would probably fall off the wall and break my bones on the rocks between the wall and the river."},

I haven't been getting enough sleep during the past week (5 hours last night), and it finally caught up with me. The shade temperature was in the low 80s (F), beautiful clouds in the sky, and a nice head wind when going south of about 7-10 mph. I should have enjoyed the beautiful day, but I didn't -- too tired.There is an old apple tree on the north-bound section of the Parkway path (north of 100th South). The tree has a lot of small apples on it. They aren't quite ripe, but they are OK for eating. I ate four of them during my run this morning. Two years ago, the tree had a lot of apples, and I enjoyed them for two or three weeks. Last year, there wern't any apples. This year, there are a lot. The tree is on the Parkway side of the fence, and technically speaking the apples belong to the city of South Jordan. However, the city doesn't prune the tree or harvest the apples, and I do the harvesting by eating the apples. I'll wait a week and then eat a few more to see if they are ripe.The Jordan River is continuing to go down. I noticed during my Saturday run that the water is almost down enough that the supports to the new bridge at 114th South are not in the water. After two more weeks, the supports will probably be completely out of the water. The path under the tunnel at 123rd South is still under water, but the rocks going from the path up hill to the edge of the tunnel is free of water but is too rocky for enjoyable walking or running. In two or three weeks, the path should be free of water, and I'll be able to go south of the tunnel."},

Because I run for time, I wasn't concerned about the distance. I was going faster today, because I reached the 5-mile mark and still had 10 minutes left to run. I forgot to mention that a couple of weeks ago, I changed my ratio of  running and walking to be 1 minute 6 seconds running and 54 seconds  walking.There were two races in progress on the Parkway this morning. One race was a marathon relay, and the other was a 5K. It was fun to see all of the runners with their numbers. I commented to the runners, as they passed, that they were looking good. The runners were all shapes and sizes, and some were running and some were walking. Some looked like they were ready to throw in the towel, and others looked peppy and full of energy.On the Draper City side of the river, south of 10600 South, there is a field that has a border of new trees. I was running past the field this morning when a man and a woman came out of the field. I asked them if they owned the field. They said \"yes\". I commented that the new trees looked nice and that new trees have been planted north of 10600 South, but those trees aren't doing very well. They commented that they've had problems with young buck deer rubbing their antlers on the new trees and damaging the trees."},

My great grandfather, Francis Webster, immigrated to Utah from England as a member of the Martin Handcart Company. The pioneers left Iowa City late in the summer, pulling handcarts, and were caught in an early blizzard. They were out of food, cold, sick, and they went into a cove to get some protection from the blizzard. Relief wagons sent by Brigham Young were on the way, and they hoped the cove would provide provide protection from the storm until the wagons arrived with blankets and food.Our first stop on Wednesday afternoon was the Sun Ranch, the central point for visitors to Martin's  Cove. We rode in a small Kawasaki truck to Martin's Cove (about 2 1/2 miles) and saw the actual place where my great grandfather, his wife, and my grandmother (a newborn baby) spent several days waiting out the blizzard. The cove is a small valley  surrounded by  hills. I've read a lot about the journey of the handcart pioneers and Martin's  Cove, and it was nice to actually be there and to see it myself. After we returned to the Ranch, we were invited by the missionaries at the Ranch to a potluck dinner and an evening of entertainment. We had a great time and laughed and laughed at the jokes and skits given by the missionaries.On Thursday morning I got a mile of jogging in the morning while waiting for the rest of our  group to get ready for the day. We drove from our Motel at Muddy Gap back to  the Sun Ranch. We walked to Devils' Gate (a narrow canyon that was caused by  ancient volcanic action and cuts through a big granite hill) and back,  about a mile of walking, and then we walked around the Ranch looking  at the museum and other things of interest.After leaving Martin's Cove, we drove about 30 miles to Willie's Landing and learned about the Willie Handcart Company that also suffered in the blizzard. That Company was about three weeks ahead of the Martin Company. After our visit at Willie's Landing, we drove back to Utah."},

I have been busy with marathon training for 2 marathons in October and trying to keep up with my family. Oct. 9th I will be running the Hi-Seoul Marathon as a training run following the Jeff Galloway method. Jeff says your wall is where your longest run was 2 weeks prior to your marathon so he takes people to 26.2 with a run walk, and only uses a 2 week taper. I plan to run this first marathon at a full minute per mile slower than my long run training pace, (so 11 minutes per mile) with walking breaks to keep me to that pace. My main marathon will then be on Oct. 23rd in Chuncheon, South Korea. It is a hilly race and my goal is to not hit The Wall and not hurt for days after so although I'm training for a 9 mpm pace, I will run to be comfortable, and not worry about my pace.In the mean time, I was interviewed by Caity from Run Barefoot Girl. We had a great time talking and she did an even better editing job on our chat. We talked about running with rheumatoid arthritis and running in Korea in addition to barefoot running. I hope you will enjoy it!"},

I'm just glad to be alive. Since my days of running 5 miles in 55 minutes, I've had my only injury (a minor knee pain that didn't keep me from running) and blood clots that were a side-effect of an auto accident 5 years before. On Saturday, two days before the blood clots, I ran 7 miles to end a 22-mile week. On Monday, I could only walk 100 feet. Recovery from those clots has been very slow. The problem was that a filter that was put in my vein after the accident, ceased working after 5 years and blocked my blood flow. My body has had to create new veins around the filter, and that has taken time. However, I really can't complain. There are many people much worse off than me. I'm alive at age 76 (almost). I have good health. I have low blood pressure. I sleep well (when I get to bed earlier). My only prescription med is Warfarin. I'm running and walking 10-15 miles per week.

I'm seeing sand bars in the river that were covered water during July. Of course, our potential flooding from the Jordan River is nothing compared to the flooding of the Mississippi River.

Many of the people who use the path do so during their noon lunch break (they work in nearby businesses), and I was finished by the time they would have left their offices.I saw one quail on the path and swarms of English sparrows. I began to wonder how the quail survive the winter. Do they migrate? Hibernate like bears? Or, just find nesting sites in thick bushes in which the cold wind won't penetrate.  Their bodies are covered with feathers, of course, and that gives them some protection. The quail might be active in the winter, I don't know. I've never seen quail in the winter.English sparrows are considered \"junk\" birds because they have no color in the bodies.

I wore rubber gloves to keep any spills from getting on my skin, but I could smell the spray, indicating I was breathing chemical fumes. However, I had a good run on Monday, and that implies the three hours I spent on Saturday didn't affect me.On Saturday I got soaked from a rain storm, and that could weaken my immune system. Maybe that was the problem. I was home about half an hour before I changed out of my wet clothes. Again, the good run on Monday sorta negates my being soaked on Saturday.Another factor was that my diet hasn't been great. Also, I was dehydrated on Wednesday.Rest seems to have helped with the problem, what ever it was.During the past 4 weeks (not counting this week) I ran 15, 10, 15, 10 miles, so maybe I was just tired and needed a rest week.

Thus, we may see swarms of mosquitoes during the next 10 days. We have about 2 1/2 months before our first frost, which will kill the mosquitoes, and that is enough time to get quite a few generations of mosquitoes.  Because Utah is a desert area, we normally don't have much of a problem with mosquitoes. So, it will be interesting to see what happens.When I moved from Phoenix to Massachusetts, I had problems with the large populations of mosquitoes in New England. Then, one day I realized I wasn't bothered by mosquitoes any more. The females would poke me and suck my blood, but I had no reaction to them.My two sons and I had heard that if one flexed his arm muscles, the mosquitoes wouldn't be able to remove their needle-nose (proboscis) and would keep sucking blood and pop. So, one day my son and I decided to test that theory. We offered our bare arms to the mosquitoes, and when they started sucking blood, we tightened the muscles in our arms. The mosquitoes (female) got their fill of blood and flew away. We thus concluded that the story we had heard was false. This experiment was held after I had stopped having reactions to mosquitoes, and I went into my house with no problems occurring from the many mosquito bites I had experienced."},
{"title": "Another HOT long run of 2 hours 20 minutes", "date": "Thursday, July 28, 2011", "text": "My wakeup heart rate was 56, and I felt pretty good. I decided to run my long run instead of my medium run of 1 hour 40 minutes. I was late getting out, and I suffered through the hottest part of the day. I drank 6 cups of water, but my urine was quite dark when I returned home. Because of the heat, I ran slower than I did on Saturday of last week, resulting in my running about 1/2 mile less in distance for the same amount of time than I did on Saturday. That is the beauty of running for time instead of for distance. In the same amount of time, I may run more distance or less distance, depending on how I feel. This helps me avoid pushing myself to meet a goal even though I'm tired of a certain distance. I still have a temptation to push myself to do a certain number of minutes, but that is easier on my body than pushing to meet a distance-goal. I took a good rest at the Draper City recreation area about a quarter mile after my turn-around point, and I took a shorter rest when I reached the picnic tables near the East Pavilion.I met a man named Harry who was painting a picture while enjoying the shade of one of the small picnic tables near the East Pavilion. He is two years younger than me and was raised in Southern Utah about 100 miles from the town I was raised in. We enjoyed talking with each other for a few minutes. He was still painting when I finished my run and returned to the East Pavilion, and I visited with him for a few minutes. The picture is of his son standing next to his motorcycle. It is a beautiful picture, and I think his son will enjoy getting it (he hasn't seen it yet). Harry said that several men who have motorcycles have asked him to paint their pictures with their motorcycles. Harry doesn't run, but he and his wife do mall-walking, and they do cycling together. His wife also does cycling without Harry, because she likes to go longer distances."},

I was out earlier to miss the mid-day heat, and Mother Nature helped in that regard. The sky was cloudy and the temp was 80 (F). Not a great temperature for running but better than the mid 90s that I've been experiencing. As I ran I focused on bending my knees more, and I noticed that I ran faster than I've been running. My goal of 1 hour for my rest run, which has allowed me to run 3 miles in the past, allowed me this morning to run 3.3 miles, a 10% increase. As with my previous runs, I didn't intentionally run faster; my body just did that on its own. I'm glad I was out earlier, because the clouds broke up, and the mid-day temperature right now is 92.And to top it all off, I found another golf ball. The path goes by a golf course, and all of the balls I've found were from drives that went way off the fairway and over the fence onto the Parkway. I found a golf ball last week on the Draper City side of the Jordan River. I was surprised to see the ball in the grass next to the path, because there are no golf courses nearby."},

I left home planning to run my medium run, but as I ran, I decided to do the long run.I ran/walked for 2 hours 20 minutes on the Jordan River Parkway, using the same route that I used last Saturday. The air temperature was in the high 90s (F), but the direct-sun temperature was probably about 110. Unfortunately, almost all of my route was in the direct sun. I drank about 9 cups of water. In fact, on the way back I drank so much water that I felt bloated. I sweat a lot and need to drink a lot to replace the sweat. I felt fine for most of the time, but the heat really got to me in the middle of the run; I didn't know if I would make the half-mile to the recreational area in Draper City. Obviously, I did make it since I'm at home writing this post and am not in a hospital suffering from heat exhaustion. I took a long (several minutes) rest in the shade at a picnic table after I refilled my water bottles. I felt fine after that.  In fact on the way back, it felt like there was a slight head-wind, but I didn't see any tall grass moving in nearby fields. The cooling from the head-wind or what ever it was felt great and helped with the heat.I didn't see many walkers, and I saw no other runners. I did see a lot of cyclists, though. As I was stretching at the end of my run in the shade of a picnic place, not far from my car at the East Pavilion, I saw a young girl who was about 3 or 4 years old riding her tricycle and carrying her younger brother. I didn't see a parent nearby, and I was worried about her safety. However, her father came out of the East Pavilion and escorted her back to a party that was going on at the pavilion. Had the father not appeared, I would have walked to the girl to ask where her parent was. I'm glad the father came before I approached the girl -- he might have thought I was stranger-danger.The water level in the river is significantly lower than it was a week ago. I guess that most of the snow in the high mountains has melted. In about another month, the water level will be down to its normal Fall level. When that happens, the tunnels under 10600 South and 12300 South won't be flooded, and I'll be able to start all my runs at the parking lot at 10000 South. I'm currently doing my rest run from that parking lot, but I'm doing my two other runs from the East Pavilion at about 10800 South in South Jordan City. During the Fall, Winter, and Spring I will, though, start some of my longer runs from the East Pavilion or the Draper recreational area to allow me to run further south than I usually do, thus bringing some variety into my routes."},

I started the run at 11:05 am and ran north of the 10000 South parking lot. Because I felt good, my body naturally ran a bit faster, and I finished the \"normal\" route in 55 minutes. I ran an additional 5 minutes to complete the 1-hour time. I didn't push my body to run faster; it just did that because it was rested and full of energy.The run was hot. There was no breeze, and there wasn't much shade on the path. However, I did enjoy the brief amounts of shade that were still there. I should have been out running earlier in the morning (there would have been a lot more shade) but I yielded to temptation and looked at my email and other things on the computer and started running about an hour later than I should have started.When I end my run at the parking lot at 10000 South, I do my stretching after the run in a corrugated steel tunnel under 10000 South. The path through the tunnel is in the shade and there is almost always a breeze blowing through the tunnel. It's a nice place to stretch and finish my cool-down from my run.The water level in the Jordan River is down a few inches. As I've mentioned before, there is a certain dead branch in the river that I use to gauge the height of the water. For the past 5-6 weeks, that stick has been covered with water, but this morning the branch was sticking an inch or so out of the water. The river is a couple hundred feet wide at that point, so that the 5 inches or so decrease in the level of the water represents a lot of water."},

Not many runners but quite a few walkers and cyclists.The Jordan River has really gone down during the past two days. The path under the 11400 South tunnel is partly dry such that people can stay on the path as they go through the tunnel. The place in Draper that I mentioned in a previous post as being completely covered with water is almost all dry. On Wednesday of this week it was about half dry.On the way back I saw a white-tailed deer (a doe). It was grazing in a field and was about 200 feet from me. As I got close to it, it hopped across the field to a grove of Russian Olive trees. It's unusual to see deer this close to civilization at this time of the year -- they are usually in the higher mountains during the summer.I felt pretty good during my run. My wakeup heart rate was 54, an indication I was well rested. Today was the third time this year that I've reached 7 miles. Previously, I quickly discovered that I couldn't maintain the 7 miles, and I dropped back to 5 miles. Hopefully, I will be able to keep the 7 miles this time.

{"title": "Had a great medium run of 100 minutes", "date": "Wednesday, July 13, 2011", "text": "Today was my first day to run by time instead of by distance. I ran for 100 minutes, going south from the East Pavilion in South Jordan (about 10800 South). My estimate of 50 minutes going south was right on, and I arrived at the turnaround point I've been using for my 5-mile route. However, I ran slightly faster going back and got a little more distance in my time-allotment.I ran faster going back because it started to rain, and I was in a heavy rain for about 15 minutes.  The cloudy sky and rain drops cooled the air and made for nice running. On the way down, I drank three bottles (1 cup each) of water, but on the way back I only drank one bottle, and that water was before and after the rain. I heard some thunder during the storm, but it was up high in the clouds and south of me, and I wasn't worried about lightning. When I hear thunder and see lightning flashes that are close to me, I count seconds (5 seconds per mile), and if the thunder is less than 5 seconds behind the flash, I look for some place to take shelter.  If I were running in a residential neighborhood, I would go to a house and ask for permission to sit on their front porch until the storm passed. However, the Jordan River Parkway is away from houses and mostly in open fields, and I'm not sure where I would go if I had to take cover. I might end up laying flat on the ground so I wouldn't attract the lightning. During the rain storm, the wind, which was a tail wind, increased to 20-30 mph, and that helped me run faster. Before the story, the wind was about 10 mph. The rain drops were cold from being high in the sky, and I felt like I was in a cold shower during the storm. As soon as the rain stopped, the sky cleared, and the heat came back. When I got home, I took a hot shower and dressed in dry clothes. I've felt fine during the day.On the way down, I passed two women who were walking. On the way back, I passed them again. One of them asked me what I was training for. I answered, \"to stay alive\". They laughed and apparently thought that was a good answer. The Jordan River is lower than it has been for several weeks. There is one place in Draper City where, during the Spring, about half the path was covered with water. Then during June, the river increased its height, and all of the path at that place was covered with water -- about 2 inches deep. Today, however, only half of the path was covered. It looks like the river has peaked in its water content, and it should slowly decrease during the summer and early Fall."},

My wakeup heart rate was 54 and I felt good during the run. There was a slight head wind when going south that didn't hinder my speed but did help to keep me cool. Because the run was short and earlier in the morning, I didn't take any water with me. I did fine without the water and without any rest stops.I've been running a particular number of miles for each run. When I'm tired I run for more minutes because my pace is slower, and when I feel good my run takes less time due to a faster pace. That is just the opposite of what I should be doing to protect my body from injury. When I'm tired, I should be running fewer miles, and when I feel good I should be running more miles. I've decided to return to running for a certain number of minutes, referred to as running time,  instead of a certain number of miles. In doing this, I'll give my body more protection against injury. If I'm tired, I'll run slower and do fewer miles, and if I feel good I'll run faster and do more miles. This is discussed in more detail in my training site.Reverting to a time-base means that I'll have to change my goals. Instead of having goals for certain number of miles, I'll have goals for certain number of minutes, as follows. The specified minutes are minutes moving not total minutes. The total minutes is longer if I take rest breaks.Rest run: 1 hour (60 minutes)Medium run: 1 hour 40 minutes (100 minutes)Long run: 2 hours 20 minutes (140 minutes)These new goals correspond approximately to my previous goals in miles."},

I had a good energy level, and I enjoyed the run.Due to a storm front that was moving through north Salt Lake City, the sky was overcast, and I appreciated not having the direct sun and not drinking quite as much water. I did have a head wind of about 20 mph, but I slowed down and didn't have much problem with the wind. I was looking forward to the return phase so the wind would be a tail wind. However, as often happens, the wind mostly died down during my return. There was a tail wind of about 3 mph for most of the return. There were a couple of rain showers of about a minute each. Not heavy rains, just sprinkles.I am continuing to practice bending my knees more. I'm a natural shuffler, and I often hear my shoes scrape the ground as I run. I'm using that sound to tell me that I'm not bending my knees enough. During today's run, I only heard the sound a couple of times of 2 or 3 seconds each. There is a particular rock at the north edge of the bridge at 12300 South that I use to gauge the height of the water in the river, and the river was about an half an inch lower than it was last Saturday. The river is supposed to peak sometime this week, The Snowbird ski resort is planning on having skiing through July 4, so there is still snow in the high Wasatch mountains that hasn't melted.I saw 7 of the black birds, and several were standing on rocks. A white duck was with the black birds, an I was able to compare the feet of the ducks with the feet of the birds. The birds do not have webbed feet. They are larger than male Mallards. Their bodies aren't coal-black, because there are areas of dark gray mixed with areas of black. There is a thin white strip near the ends of the wings."},

However, they realized the water was deeper than they had thought, and they turned back. However, the dogs had something different in mind.One lady had a big dog, and that dog sat down in the water and wouldn't move. The lady stood there trying to get the dog to move, but the dog stayed put. The other lady had two small dogs, and she stopped to wait until her friend got the big dog to get up and walk out of the water. The two small dogs were happy with the water, and they started to drink from the river. When I got around the water and continued my run/walk, the dogs were still in the water. However, when I returned to the 11400 South bridge on my way back, the dogs were gone.On my return visit to the 11400 South bridge, I saw a lady and two children on bicycles. The kids (ages about 7 and 10 years old) rode their bikes through the water, giggling as the water splashed on their feet. After they exited the water, they stopped and rode back though the water. I watched them while they made four or five trips through the water. I told the mother about the two dogs I had seen on my first visit to the bridge, and I remarked that both dogs and children know what is best on a hot day!

During my training I've been running 1 minute and then walking 1 minute, but I knew if I was to beat my time of 48 minutes set last fall, I would have to do more running and less walking. I thus set my timer for 1 minute 30 seconds running and 30 seconds walking. I kept that up for the first mile but realized I couldn't continue that amount of running. I thus cut my running time and lengthened my walking time. I finished in 49 minutes plus some seconds that I don't remember. In retrospect I should have run for 1 minute and walked for 45 seconds. I did get a 2nd place medal for my age division of 65-99. I didn't earn the medal, though, since there were only two of us oldies in the race.It was a nice day for running. The temperature was probably in the 50s due to the early start of the race. Since I did  lot of walking, I could have worn long pants and not suffered from heat buildup.Unless the group sponsoring my grandson's swimming classes sponsors another 5K next fall, this is the only race I'll run until next summer. I just run for enjoyment rather than for racing. I do like this particular race, however. The course is on the Jordan River Parkway where I run each week.

{"title": "Running Obsession", "date": "Thursday, June 16, 2011", "text": "By Wendy Runners have a propensity for being obsessive. Maybe one needs an obsessive streak to be a runner, or maybe the payoffs of running create obsessiveness. I don't know which it is, but I've see many runners let the obsession take over and drive them to injury or burn out.One thing I have been working on lately is running for the fun of it and not letting running run my life. Being on the verge of marathon training, I’m looking at my 18 week plan and realizing this will be a focal point of my life for the next 4 ½ months. Often, after a course of marathon training, people are burnt out and swear they will never do it again. Many eventually forget their negative feelings and start up the next year, but my goal is not to get to that place. I want to enjoy my training and finish my marathon thinking about the next one. I want to work my training around my life so that I don’t feel like I am giving up living to run. Part of the way I am doing this is by picking a less aggressive training plan than I had originally intended and rearranging the days so that my long run is on Friday, I can cross train by doing an extremely easy run/hike with a fun group on Saturdays, and take Sunday totally off to be ready to start again on Monday. I’m also learning not to be a slave to a schedule. I love to count things, nearly to the point of being obsessive so it thrills me to see my miles adding up, calculate my averages, and fill in the pages of my log. Unfortunately, I often get lost in the numbers and fail to listen to my body because I don’t want to fall behind on my mileage goals, but this is a recipe for disaster. I will track my training miles, but if I miss a run, oh well, I’m not going to let it make me a worried wreck about race day. I know I can finish a marathon, training is just about how fast and how I’ll feel the next day. Yes, I’d love to set a personal record, but more importantly I want to ENJOY the process and race. Running is good and promotes health. Obsessions, not so much!"},

I had 7 hours of sleep, and that always makes me feel good when I wake up. I went running (9:30) soon after I got up, because I wanted to miss the hottest part of the day (afternoon). I ran 3.2 miles, and I practiced squatting more and bending my knees more.The stick that I've used to gauge the level of the river is completely covered with water. Last week the stick was about an inch above the water, so the river height is probably 2-3 inches higher than it was last week. The newspaper said the ski resorts nearby still have at least 10 feet of snow, so there is a lot of melting to take place, and the river will continue to rise. There is a law that prohibits the Jordan River from rising more than a specified amount, and eventually the gates that control the amount of water that leaves Utah Lake and enters the Jordan River will be closed. This means Utah Lake will start to rise, and that may cause flooding of nearby homes. The increase in water that I'm seeing in the Jordan River is small compared to the increases in the Mississippi River, but is is large for Utah, especially in the south end of the Salt Lake Valley. As the Jordan River passes through Salt Lake City, It is significantly higher than it is where I run, because several creeks dump water into the river, and those creeks are at flood-stage due to the melting of the snow.I saw a lot of red, pink, and yellow blossoms that I haven't seen before. The red and pink blossoms are big (4-5 inches in diameter), and the plants having the blossoms looked like poppy plants. The yellow blossoms are small and look like they come from a weed. The blossoms lasted for about 1/4 mile, and they made a pretty sight.During the last half-mile of my run, I saw a white bird in the sky. At first I thought it was a Seagull, but as the bird approached me, I recognized it as a Pelican. The bird was about 100 yards away when it disappeared behind some bushes and landed on the Jordan River. I could tell the bird had something in its mouth, but I couldn't see what it was. When I reached the spot where the Pelican had landed, I saw it in the river with a fish in its mouth. The bird ducked its large beak into the water and held it there for about three seconds. Then, the bird raised its head, and the fish was gone. Apparently the bird needed water to help it swallow the fish."},

Unfortunately, most of the route I was using is in direct sun. There was no breeze on the way out, but on the way back there was a breeze of 5-7 mph.

My Fuel Belt carries 5 cups, and I filled the cups at the Draper City playground on my way back.

A few years ago, I tried to run with a lighter touch and less noise, I referred to it as stealth running. However, I noticed then that when I was tired, my shoes made more noise, especially from the toes of my shoes hitting the ground. I noticed today that when I had good form, I ran with almost no noise, not even the scraping noise I've frequently had due to my shuffling, and no noise from my toes slapping the ground. Keeping my knees bent means my mid-foot and fore-foot of the shoes are already on the ground, and there is no tendency for my toes to slap the ground. Bent knees also make it difficult to do a heel-strike. I'm glad I read about keeping my knees bent, and that is turning out to be a significant improvement in my form and in my running.I signed up yesterday for the South Jordan City Summer Fest 5K. It's a small race, about 50 runners, and runs along the Jordan River Parkway where I do much of my running. I've run the race twice, and I like the small-town atmosphere of the race. I set my current PR of 30:43 four years ago during this race. However, the blood clots I had in January 2009 have really slowed me down. I ran a 5K 6 months ago and finished in 48:02. I'll be happy if I run the 5K in on Saturday in 48:00 or better."},

{"title": "A great 5-mile Medium run", "date": "Wednesday, June 08, 2011", "text": "My wakeup heart rate was 56 again. I started my run about noon. The sky was sunny with clouds, but by the time I reached the turn-around point at the 12300 South bridge, the sky was getting black with lots of wind. A few drops of rain fell during my return to my car, but nothing to cause worry. No thunder.When I reached the Draper City playground (with 1/4 mile to go to reach the 12300 South bridge), I stopped to get a drink of water. I then proceeded to the bridge and returned to the playground. While walking to the water fountain, I saw a few pieces of trash on the ground and picked it up. One lady was embarrassed by the trash her kids had left on the ground, and she wanted me to give her the trash I had picked up so she could deposit it in the trash bin. I said the trash bin was close to the water fountain and that I would deposit the trash before I got a drink. I'm glad she was embarrassed; maybe she will teach her children to use the trash bin instead of dropping the trash on the ground. While I was filling my water bottles at the water fountain, a young girl about 5 years old asked me why the bottles were so small. I explained that each bottle held one cup of water, and the bottles were spaced around my body to keep me balanced while I ran. After I left the playground and proceeded north towards my car, I thought it would have been nice to have let the girl try on my Fuel Belt to see how it felt. Oh, well, maybe there will be another girl wondering about the small bottles.I've been reading a book by Barefoot Ken Bob in which he emphasizes the importance of one bending his or her knees to insure a heel-strike is not used and to insure the foot hits the ground behind the knee. During this run, I tried bending my knee more instead of trying to raise my knee. Doing that really works! I ran faster and didn't get as tired during my run. I will continue trying to have more bend in my knees.The Jordan River is a couple of inches higher that it was last week. There is significantly more water under the new 11400 South bridge. I noticed on my way back that the swallows are busy getting mud from the river bank and building mud houses on the north side of the bridge."},

I ran twice the north-bound segment of the Jordan River Parkway. I was out about 10:30, but the temperature was in the mid 80s (F). Ironically, due to a cold front passing through, during the afternoon the sky clouded up, the wind increased to 40 or more mph, and the temperature dropped to the middle 70s (F). I got out \"early\" for my run, because two workmen were here during the day to repair a concrete wall that is in front of my house, and I wanted to get my run in before they got into the difficult part of the repair.According to the tree-limb I use to judge the level of the water, the river has gone done about an inch at the point where the limb is sticking out of the water. The cooler temperature we had in the afternoon and evening will help slow the melting of the mountain snow."},

Being tired that way is normal and nothing that would cause concern.The tunnel under 11400 South had more water on the path than it has had in the past, indicating the river has risen a couple of inches. As I've mentioned before, that part of the river is very wide, and a two-inch increase in the water level implies a big increase in the flow of water.I saw a group of about 20 young girls on bicycles and three women as chaperones. They were probably a church group or maybe girl scouts, although none of them were wearing scout uniforms."},

I moved about 700 pounds of sand and Soil Pep off the shelves and onto a cart. I then pushed the cart around Home Depot and then to my car, and I moved the bags to my car and then from my car to our garden. The 700 pounds included two bags at 80# each and 6 bags at 50# each. We have a \"recipe\" that uses sand, Soil Pep, and gypsum that converts clay into loam. After unloading the car, I rototilled one of our gardens while my wife spread the \"recipe\" on a second garden. I then rototilled that garden. After finishing the rototilling, I mowed my lawns. When I was finished with the lawns, I was really tired. I felt much worse than I felt after completing a marathon (of course I'm 29 years older than I was when I ran marathons).I had wanted to go running after finishing the yard work, but I was too tired for that. However, I felt better this morning, and I went running. After 1.5 miles, I could tell I was too tired to do more, and I went to my car and drove home.We had beautiful weather today. No rain and lots of sun. The air temperature was in the high 70s (F). My next run will be on Saturday."},

I did 15 miles for the week.My wakeup heart rate was 57, and I felt pretty good during the run. I ran from the East Pavilion in South Jordan to the tunnel under 12300 South in draper and back. The tunnel is still flooded. The path under the new 11400 South bridge is still flooded with about the same amount of water on that path as there was on Wednesday. I got around the water by going on the dirt under the bridge. I didn't take any rest stops during the run. I forgot my 2-phase timer again, and I just ran until I started getting tired, and then I walked for a minute or so. I had a good drink of water at the East Pavilion before I started and again after I completed the run. I do wish that Draper City would turn on the water at the large playground that is 1/4 mile north of the tunnel under 12300 South. The sky was cloudy with patches of sun during my run. However, it started to sprinkle a bit just as I was finishing, and by the time I drove home the sky was completely overcast. The forecast was for rain Saturday evening, and I wasn't surprised at the change in the weather. I'm just glad that I got home before it rained, because I didn't take my rain gear with me on the run.I'm still running pretty slow. My running phases are 14-16 minutes per mile, and my walking phases are 20-22 minutes per mile. It took me an hour and a half to complete the 5 miles. That's OK, though.

So I've decided to  change my short-time goals to be a rest run of 4 miles, a medium run of 5 miles  and a long run of 7 miles.

The air temperature was in the low 70s, and except for a headwind of about 10 mph when going south, it was a nice day. I tried not to push myself when going south. I didn't want to tire myself by fighting the wind.I forgot my GPS, but that is OK, because I know the route to get 6.3 miles. I also forgot my 2-cycle timer that I use to tell me when I should switch from running to walking and vice versa. Instead of counting steps, I just let my body tell me when it needed a change in pace. In the beginning, I ran longer and walked shorter than I've been doing, but as the run progressed and I became tired, I reduced my running and increased my walking. I walked the last 1/8 mile and was glad when I climbed into my car.While I was on the Draper City side of the river and was going south, I saw three Pelicans flying over my head. They were low, and I could see their big beaks and the black on their wing tips. A woman walker who passed me while I was stopped and was watching the Pelicans said a fourth Pelican was following the three, but I never saw it. They are a beautiful bird.Due to the high water in the river, the bushes, trees, and grass on the edge of the river are surrounded by water, and I was thinking that if I were a female duck, that is where I would want to raise my ducklings. Lots of water that isn't moving very fast. Lots of plants. A great neighborhood for families of new ducklings. In fact, on my run last Saturday, I saw two families of ducklings in that area."},

It was a nice day for running, though.At around the 0.5 mile marker, there are some dead limbs in the river, and I'm using one of the limbs as my marker to guage the water-level of the river. During the winter, when the river is at its lowest point, the stick projected about 18 inches out of the water. This spring, when the river was much higher, the stick projected about 4 inches. When I did my run this afternoon, the stick projected about an inch. The river is quite wide at that point, and several inches of height means there is a lot more water in the river than there was during the winter."},
{"title": "Ran 6 miles but legs tired", "date": "Friday, May 20, 2011", "text": "Today was a pretty good run, because my body felt strong. My legs, however, were tired. I took several brief rest stops, but I was able to maintain my alternation of 1 minute running and 1 minute of walking. The air temperature was in the 50s (F), and the sky was cloudy with patches of sunshine here and there. The forecast is for sunshine and no rain for several days.For the first time this Spring, I encountered water under the new tunnel at 11400 South. This means the river has risen several inches since Monday. The water on the path wasn't very deep, and I walked through the water. I didn't feel water on my toes, so the depth was probably about an inch.I saw two Pelicans on the lower fishing pond in South Jordan when I passed the pond on my way south. I also saw two Pelicans flying over the upper fishing pond. I've also seen quite a few red-winged black birds along the river, both north of 10000 South and south of 10600 South. On Monday I saw several Quail running along the path, but I didn't see any babies. This is the time of year that the Quail should have younguns following them. Today I saw several families of ducks. One family only had four ducklings, but the other families each had 8 or 9 ducklings. The high river means a lot of the land next to the river is flooded, and that makes nice places for the ducklings. I stopped to watch one family of ducks. The mother and the ducklings started to swim towards the fast current in the middle of the river. I wondered if the ducklings would be able to swim against the fast current. However, the mother and her ducklings swerved away from the center of the river and went to an \"island\" of grass sticking out of the water. That grass was about 20 feet from the shore, but the water wasn't moving very fast through the grass."},

I had a good running-week last week, and my old body needs more rest than one day (Sunday). I wore my wind breaker as an additional layer for warmth. I took it off for a few minutes when the sun came out, but I put it back on when the sun disappeared behind clouds. Since I'm walking half the time and am running relatively slow, I need more layers than I have used in the past."},
{"title": "A good 6.25 mile run, with rain at the end", "date": "Saturday, May 14, 2011", "text": "I ran 6.25 miles on the same route that I used on Thursday. In fact, my run followed the same pattern that it did on Thursday: good in the beginning, tired in the middle, and good at the end. The difference in the two runs is that I took fewer rest stops today (only one near the turn-around point) and the change from being tired to having a good run at the end happened sooner than on Thursday.When I first started the run, the sky was mostly clear with fluffy clouds, and the temperature was in the low 70s (F). However, as my run progressed, the sky darkened, and I could tell it was either raining over the mountains or soon would be raining there. A north wind of about 5-10 mph was blowing, and that was good, because the storm clouds were gathering in the south, and a north wind would help keep the storm from advancing so much. However, after I had gone about half a mile on my return trip, the wind changed from a north wind to a south wind, and that meant the storm would advance at an even faster rate. Sure enough, the storm did just that. It soon started to sprinkle and then it settled into a gentle but steady rain. I hadn't expected the rain, and I had left my rain gear at home. That was OK, because the air temperature was warm, and the rain didn't feel cold. I enjoy running in warm summer rain. This rain wasn't quite a warm rain, but it wasn't a cold rain either.There was a lot of thunder in the mountains. When I see lightning flashes, I count seconds until I hear the corresponding thunder to get an approximation of the distance to the lightning strikes (I assume 5 seconds per mile).  The lightning strikes were about 1 1/2 miles away, and I wasn't worried about them. However, when I was about two miles from my car, I realized the lightning strikes were only a mile away. This worried me since there aren't a lot of trees near that part of the path, and I was one of the higher objects in the area. I did, though, realize the lightning strikes were in the clouds, and I decided I would be OK. The sky was pretty black, and I could hardly see the mountains due to the storm clouds that covered the mountains, down almost to the valley floor.My car was parked at the South Jordan East Pavilion, which is at about 108th South. When I reached the new bridge at 114th South, I stopped for a few minutes to tweet about the rain. My telephone is an inexpensive model and doesn't have a full keyboard. Tweeting via texting is thus a slow process. The light on my phone turned off, and I couldn't see the keyboard. In addition, I couldn't read the screen very well due to not having my glasses, and I made a couple of spelling errors. After sending the tweet, I continued my run. As I approached my car, I noticed the rain was stopping, and by the time I arrived home, the rain had stopped. Utah storms don't last very long, in contrast to some of the storms I experienced in Massachusetts (heavy rain that didn't stop for two or three days).The hardest part of the run was taking off my wet t-shirt due to the cloth sticking to my back. After a couple minutes struggling with the t-shirt, I finally got it off, and I dressed in dry clothes. All in all, it was a great run! I'm still doing 1 minute of running and 1 minute of walking, although I ran the last half mile without stopping so I would get to my car sooner."},

My legs became tired during the middle of the run but felt fine during the last mile or so. On Tuesday I was on my feet for over 8 hours. I wasn't moving around, just standing and watching a new furnace and water heater being installed. My feet were stiff and sore when I went to bed Tuesday night, and they were still stiff when I began my run today. I did some extra walking during the middle of my run but got back to my alternating of running and walking for 1 minute each during the last part of my run.The Jordan River is still high and is expected to go higher as the snow melts in the high mountains. I run in the southern part of the Salt Lake valley, and the water in the river is mostly from Utah Lake. This means that the level in the river where I run isn't affected by snow-melt as much as it is further north. There are several major creeks that drain into the river, but those creeks are north of me. As the river approaches the Great Salt Lake, there is serious concern that the river will overflow its banks and flood the surrounding area. In fact, consideration is being given to create holes in the dikes bordering the river so the excess water will flood wetlands instead of industrial and residential areas.The temperature during my run was in the low to mid 60s (F) and the sky was mostly clear with some clouds -- lots of sunshine. A lot of people were on the Parkway, runners, walkers, dog-walkers, cyclists, skaters. The water was turned on at the East Pavilion in South Jordan where I began my run, and I had a big drink before I started running, but I was disappointed to find that the water was still turned off in the Draper recreational area near the turn-around point of my run (I ran north from the East Pavilion to the tunnel under 106th South (still flooded) and then ran south to the tunnel under 123rd South (still flooded) and then north to the East Pavilion. I needed water and had to stay dehydrated until I got back to the South Jordan area. I guess I'll have to get my Fuel Belt out and carry water.As two cyclists passed me just before I reached the tunnel under 123rd South, one of them said, \"I like your shirt\" (I was wearing my blue LOCO shirt that said on the back, \"I've gone LOCO\". I replied that I was loco for getting into running. I wanted to explain that LOCO is a brand of running shoes, but being on bicycles, the cyclists were gone before I could say anything about shoes.When I was about a mile and a half south of the bridge across 114th South, I passed a pasture with quite a few horses. I stopped to look at them, and one of the horses came to the fence. I picked some grass and fed it to him. On my way back, that same horse saw me and came to the fence. I didn't stop, though, because the fence was about 20 feet from the path. I ran for a couple hundred feet and reached a point where the fence was next to the path. I stopped to feed the horse, but he had given up on me and was grazing with other horses."},

I only had 6 hours sleep last night, but later today, after my run, I had a good 1-hour nap. There was a slight rain during my run. After I got home, I changed into dry clothes, and I hope I won't have a cold like I did last week when I didn't change into dry clothes.On the way home I bought a spray can of Silicone, and tomorrow I will spray my rain jacket, pants, hat, and shoes. The rain is predicted to remain until Wednesday afternoon, so I will have a good opportunity to test the Silicone spray in a rain storm. I've used the spray in the past, and it does a good job of keeping moisture from leaking through my clothes.The river is a few inches higher than it was a month ago. According to the forecasters, the water in the creeks and river is just from the low-level snow melting and from rain storms. The snow in the high mountains is still to melt, so our danger of floods will continue for another month. When I run the north-bound segment of the Parkway, I measure the height of the water in the Jordan River by how much a particular stick is out of the water. The stick is almost buried, and there is only an inch or two of the stick showing. The river at that point is quite wide, and the extra width of the river helps keep the height of the water down. This morning I was watching a news report of the flooding in Memphis, and I feel really sorry for those folks. Our flooding will be nothing compared to the floods on the Mississippi River.During my run I saw several red-winged black birds and a couple of quail. The air temperature was in the low 40s (F), and I guess the feathers keep the birds warm. I also saw two whitish birds, with a long wing span, fly over making a strange squawk. I didn't get a good look at them, and I don't know what they are. I've never heard a squawk like that before.There is more water in the tunnel under 106th South. There have been two pumps trying to keep the water out of the tunnel, but one of the pumps isn't working. I used the South Jordan City website to report the problem. Some of the water has been in the tunnel for about two months, and there is green algae growing in the water."},

I still catch myself counting steps once in a while, but for the most part, I rely on the counter and enjoy watching the people and wildlife. I can stop and pickup litter and not worry about keeping track of my steps as I continue my run.There were a lot of people on the Parkway, enjoying the beautiful day. The cyclists were especially numerous. I saw several couples walking hand in hand. And, of course, a few dogs walking their masters.The Jordan River is several inches lower than it has been. This nice weather that we're having will increase the melting of the snow in the mountains and the likelihood of floods. I heard on the news today that a flood alert has been announced for Emigration Creek (the creek runs through the center of Salt Lake City.  Salt Lake County has hundreds of thousands of bags and tons of sand and rock.

I then ran South into Draper City and then ran back to the East Pavilion.Quite a few trees have been planted along some pastures in Draper. With the warmer weather we've been having, these trees have taken off, and the trees have a lot of new leaves. The trees are in the open and get a lot of sun. The trees that were planted north of 10000 South have new leaves but not nearly as many leaves as the trees further south in Draper. These trees have more shade during the afternoon.I saw two large, white Pelicans in the lower fishing pond in South Jordan. A year ago there were two Pelicans that hung around for a couple of weeks in the Spring. It's nice to see them back again (of course, these might not be the same ones that were here a year ago). The following picture is from the web.My running friend, Bruce, who comments frequently in this blog has been  diagnosed with cancer. Tomorrow is his first treatment of chemotherapy. For the next several weeks, he isn't able to run, and a bunch of us in the forum at running.about.com decided to let Bruce know he has our love and support during this difficult time in his life.

I had to prune the sticks down to almost ground level before I found green wood and leaf-buds.After we finished the roses, I was busy all day helping my wife get ready for an Easter party for our grand kids. I spent a good part of the day on my computer printing Easter pictures for my wife. Last night when I started printing pictures, I could tell the blue color wasn't printing. I spent a couple of hours this morning trying to get my ink cartridge filled and then finally going to a different store and buying a new cartridge. My wife had glossy card stock that I used for the pictures, and the pictures looked like they had been printed on photo paper. The glossy card stock is less expensive than photo paper. The pictures are old fashioned pictures of kids, rabbits, and similar things and look really cute. The pictures are on a CD that my wife bought a few years ago.During the day we had a terrific storm pass through the area. Southern Salt Lake County, where I live, only had rain, hail, thunder, and lightning, but northern Salt Lake County and the mountainous areas east of Salt Lake City had stronger winds that blew over trees, knocked out windows, and shut down the power-system. I waited until the storm was over and I had most of the pictures printed for my wife, and then I went running. The sun was just going down when I started, and it was dark when I finished. The tunnel under 10600 South was still flooded, and I ran back and forth from 9400 South to 10600 South, as I've been doing for the past few runs. Actually, the water in the tunnel was down to about 2 inches, even though the water in the Jordan River is about four inches higher than it was last week.I had a pretty good energy level for 3.25 miles, and then I started getting tired. I stopped to rest twice during the last mile, and the rests of about a minute each really rejuvenated me such that I felt fine. My wakeup heart rate was 62 this morning, higher because I only had about 5 hours sleep for two nights this week. I went to bed at the same time I usually go to bed, but I woke up after 5 hours sleep and couldn't go back to sleep. I did have 7 hours sleep (my normal amount) last night."},

It rained (sometimes a drizzle and sometimes a light rain) during the whole run. The temperature was around 50 (F).As I've mentioned in past posts, my nylon jacket needs to be sprayed with Silicone because it doesn't repel water very well, and when I finished, my Pearl iZUMi shirt was damp. I'm glad I didn't run longer, because I was starting to get cold due to a stronger breeze that came in during the last part of the run. As soon as I got home, I jumped into a hot shower and enjoyed the heat. However, I drained the water tank, and when the water started to get cooler, I got out. I ate a bowl of hot oatmeal for breakfast, and I've been comfortable during the day. I wore running shorts during the run, but my legs didn't feel cold. I've never had problems with my legs getting cold. In Massachusetts, I would wear shorts until the temperature got down to freezing. I remember one run in shorts while the temperature was down to 27. Now that I'm older, I switch to long pants when the temperature is in the low 40s.There is still water in the tunnel under 106th South but not as much as in the past few days. I guess the two pumps that are running 24/7 are slowly draining the tunnel. A lot of water, though, is coming into the tunnel through several pipes along the west wall of the tunnel that catch water draining from the ground around the tunnel."},

The first 1.5 miles was walking in my neighborhood while two of my grandkids drove our electric jeep around. Later in the day, after half an hour nap, I ran 5 miles on the Jordan River Parkway. I'm really enjoying the two-phase timer that I bought. I have each phase set for 1 minute, and it beeps at the end of each minute, telling me I need to change pace. The tunnel under 106th South is still flooded, and I ran the 5 miles back and forth between 94th South and 106th South. I had planned on stopping at 4 miles (so my total for the day would be 5.5 miles), but I felt fine (although a little bit tired) and I continued another mile.Spring is one of my favorite times of the year. It means the bitter cold of winter is gone. Leaves are budding on the trees, and blossoms are appearing. The ducks are leaving the river and going off somewhere to have babies. Today was that way. Temperature in the low 60s (F), lots of people and dogs on the Parkway. Lots of sun and almost no breeze. Another great day!"},

Three grandchildren are staying with us for 10 days, and they wanted to drive a battery-operated plastic jeep that we have, so I postponed my run and went with the kids. We made two loops around the neighborhood where I live, a total of about 1.5 miles. My grandkids took turns driving the jeep, and I walked behind them. I felt pretty good during that walk -- high energy and a peppy feeling. About three hours later, I drove to the Jordan River Parkway for my mid-week run. Instead of feeling peppy, I felt tired, and when I reached the Parkway, I sat in my car for a couple of minutes wondering if I really wanted to run. I finally got out of the car and went south. I'd gone about half a mile when I decided the two miles from 100th South to 106th South and back would be all I could do. On the way back, I did mostly walking. It was a nice day to be out, pleasant temperature and sunshine, but not a nice day for me to be out. I also walked the 1.5 miles yesterday while the kids drove the jeep, so yesterday wasn't a full rest-day. Maybe that caused me to be tired today. What ever the reason, I'm glad I didn't push myself to go further today."},

The temperature was in the high 50s, the sun was shinning, and I enjoyed being outside. I planned to do some shopping after my run, and I wore my long running pants and my wind breaker. I walked for a few minutes and chatted with a walker. He said I looked like I was thin. I thought that was interesting, because I'm about 10 pounds heaver than I was before my blood clots two years ago. I guess I looked thin to him.Even though we're still having rain and some snow, we're past the really cold temperatures, and I'm enjoying my running more than I did in the winter. Spring and Fall are the times I try to improve my running. Summer and Winter are the times I reduce my attempts at improvements and just run to survive. I used to really enjoy the extremes of weather, but I'm finding as I get older that I don't enjoy the extremes as much as I used to.I've been using my Saucony shoes, and I now have 100 miles on those shoes. I've updated my review of the Saucony shoes to reflect my opinion of them after 100 miles. Starting with my next run, I'll be using my Pearl iSUMi shoes for a few months.I saw two quail running across the path. In a month from now, the quail will have babies following them.I found 4 golf balls and added them to the 2 that I have at home. I'm hoping to give them to my grandson, Erik, although I haven't offered them to him yet. If he wants to, he can sell them to his neighbors who golf."},

In fact, it was snowing when I left home, and the snow continued for about half a mile. Then the snow changed to snow/rain flurries for the rest of my run. The temperature was in the mid 30s (F), so there was no danger of ice on the path. There was a slight breeze blowing from the north, but it didn't amount to much.I ran 5.5 miles, and this run was another nice ending to a nice week. I felt fine during the run, and reducing my running segments by 10 seconds seems to be keeping my energy level higher as I run (not so tired at the end of a running segment). Because the tunnel under 106th South is now mostly free of water, I ran south for 2 3/4 mile and then returned. The second pump that was installed in the tunnel is really putting a lot of water back into the river. In fact, the older pump is putting more water back into the river than it had been doing (maybe the workmen cleaned a filter on the pump, or something). I saw a couple of walkers and a few other runners on the path, but the \"running\" traffic on the Parkway was significantly lower than it normally would be on a Saturday.I saw two large birds take off from the Jordan River. They were larger than a Canadian goose, and they had a smaller head and a thinner and longer neck than a goose. They were a light brown color and made a strange noise (compared to ducks or geese) when they flew past me. In fact, it was that noise that brought them to my attention."},

That happened today during my run, although the rain didn't last very long -- I guess the devil was just chuckling.When I started my run by going north from 100th South, there was a nice tailwind of 10-15 mph. It was nice having that wind push me. However, as soon as I turned around and headed south, the wind was a headwind, and I slowed down a bit to conserve my energy. Rain and later snow were forecast, and I wore my long pants. I felt comfortable with the headwind, but I was a bit too warm with the tailwind.On the way back, the sky got darker and a few sprinkles came down. I finished my run (5.25 miles), got in my car and headed home. I had driven about 1/4 mile when it started hailing pea-size pellets. The ground was white when I got home. A couple of minutes after I got into the house, the hail turned to rain. I'm glad I wasn't caught in the storm. The temperature wasn't particularly cold, and the hail would have been mostly just a mess for running.My wakeup heart rate was 57. It has been 57 for the past several days. I felt pretty good during the run, and to cap it all off, I found a golf ball. I'm saving the balls to give to my grandson, Erik, so he can sell them. The Parkway path goes past two golf courses, and I usually find 6 or 7 balls during the golfing season.The tunnel under 106th South has been flooded for several  weeks, due to the high water in the Jordan River. When I reached the  tunnel this afternoon, I saw three South Jordan City employees working  on the pump that is supposed to remove water from the tunnel. They were  apparently having success, because most of the water in the tunnel was  gone. Instead of turning around as I had planned, I continued going  south for another 0.75 miles. On the way back, I stopped to talk with  one of the workmen. He said the pump that was trying to keep the tunnel  dry was too small, and they had temporarily installed another pump to  assist the original pump. He said the two pumps were able to keep the  water out of the tunnel, and they will, if they can find a pump of the  right size, replace the existing pump with a larger pump that will be  able to handle the water in the tunnel. I hope they are successful."},

I wore my long pants and three layers, and I felt fine going out due to the headwind taking heat away from my body. Coming back, though, I was too warm, and I took off my windbreaker during the last half-mile. There was a lot of sunshine, and the temperature was in the high 40s (F). The ground is covered with the snow we had a couple of days ago, but the path was clear and dry.I've noticed that after about 2 miles, my legs start getting tired, and I've changed to walking about 10 seconds or so before the timer beeped. I decided to change the timer to reduce the time I run, and I now have the timer set for 1 minute running and 1 minute walking. By running a bit less, I hope I won't get as tired. I passed a herd of cows grazing in a field.

My wife has a couple of nieces who live in the south end of the Salt Lake valley, and the girl who said hello was probably one of those nieces.I enjoyed the run. I completed 5 miles and felt pretty good during most of the run but did get tired during the last mile and a half. I'm still catching myself mentally counting steps, although the counting is mostly during the first part of a phase. I noticed that the beeping of my timer sounds like birds chirping in the nearby trees. I'm glad the timer beeps twice, and the second beep helps me recognize that the beeping is not from birds.In order to set the record straight, I thought I'd mention that all of my April Fools post is true except for the last paragraph. What really happened during my checkup on March 31 was that no skin cancers that need to be biopsied were found, and about 4 or 5 pre-cancers were frozen.

My dad was of the older generation who always wore a hat everywhere he went. Even with the shading from his hat, he still had skin cancers on his head. I was of the new generation who took pride that we didn't wear hats at all. So, for 41 years, I baked my head in bright Utah and Arizona sunshine, happy to be a member of the \"liberated\" generation. But, eventually, mother nature caught up with me.I had my first skin cancer removed in 1976, a few months after I moved from Arizona to Massachusetts. Each year I got a few more skin cancers. Not only was mother nature catching up with me, she was getting her revenge on me.For the past several years, I've had quarterly checks for skin cancers. I usually have a few pre-cancers that are frozen by liquid nitrogen, and I sometimes have a skin cancer or two removed by surgery and the resulting skin grafts. A few years ago, I had a skin cancer removed that was bigger in diameter than a golf ball and 1/4 inch deep. The skin graft, using skin from my shoulder didn't work, and the doctor used pig-skin for another graft, and that one did work. I think that may be the reason why I have warm, fuzzy feelings whenever I walk near pigs.Anyway, back to my checkup yesterday. The doctor did find one skin cancer, a Basal Cell that was so big the doctor wasn't sure he could safely remove it and have a skin-graft cover the hole. In fact, he decided the only way to remove it would be to cut off my head and sew on a pigs head. I agreed to it, and I'm scheduled for surgery next week. I'll be the worlds first running chimera. Maybe they will create a new category for me, the Chimera Category. I'm hoping I get big skin cancers on my legs so I can get a set of race-horse legs...."},

The trail to the house is hidden and not part of the trail system used by hikers. Cell phone and satellite Internet access are the only contact the house has with society. I daydream of that house a lot, especially on beautiful days such as this in which the mountains of the Wasatch Range stand out in all their splendor.The temperature was in the high 60s (F), and there was lots of sun and  beautiful clouds. A 3-mph or so tail wind blew me the 2.5 miles from the  East Pavilion in South Jordan to the tunnel (flooded) under 12300 South.  I went a bit slower than normal, and I enjoyed the run and walk. Having  the timer beep me when it was time to change pace was nice, although I  did notice that sometimes I was still counting in my mind. On the way back, I began to get too warm, and there wasn't much I could do but plod on to the end of the run. What had been a tail wind while I was going out was now a head wind, and I was grateful for the cooling effect of the breeze. There is only one bench along the Draper City side of the trail, and I stopped there for a couple of minutes and gazed at Lone Peak.I saw a lot of walkers, runners, cyclists, and skaters on the path. One guy, who was being pulled by two large dogs passed me as fast as he would if he were on a bicycle. Those dogs weren't stopping for anybody. One small dog, as I passed him, came over to me and licked my hand a few times -- a very friendly and happy dog.The level in the River was down a small amount today. My wife heard on the news that the snow pack in the mountains for the whole state of Utah is 130 - 200% of normal and that the mountain lands are saturated with water. I really hope we have a cool spring so the snow pack melts slowly. If we don't, we'll have major floods all over the state. The Virgin River down by St. George is of special concern since it flows through residential areas, and the land adjacent to the river is pretty flat. At least in Utah and Salt Lake counties, the land near the Jordan River is raised due to hills near the river or to simple dikes that the pioneers built when they settled this area."},

However, continually counting left-foot-steps is tedious and distracting, and I've been hoping there would be a better way to measure the time spent in each phase. My hope has come true. I just bought an interval timer from Jeff Galloway that measures in minutes and seconds the lengths of two laps. One lap is used for running and the other lap is used for walking. I've posted a review of the timer in my runninginjuryfree site.by WendyI've had a lot of ups and downs already for 2011. It seems like every time I get the ball rolling, something knocks me back and my RA flares up. Following a vacation at the beginning of March, I discovered I had picked up a Giardia infection and needed antibiotics. Rheumatoid Arthritis flares up with the immune system ramps up so in addition to the stomach upset and the strong antibiotics, I had RA slam dunking me too. I was in the throws of a real pity party, and had to cut my mileage down, but I refused to stop. It took a couple of weeks of determined fighting, but I got over the illness and medication and beat back the flare through slow steady runs.The hardest aspect of this strategy is convincing yourself to exercise when it seems like it is the last thing you want to do, but it is SO important to get out there. Fitness is like a knights shining armor. Without being in good shape, you are like one of the peasants on the front line of a medieval battle with just a cotton tunic and a pitch fork. Sure, you might get lucky and survive the fight, you might even get a couple of good licks in, but chances are better that you are going to get squashed like a bug.On the other hand, a person that has taken good care of themselves, exercised regularly, maintained a healthy weight, and feed their body with a healthy nutritious diet, is like the knight up on his horse in full body armor with a spear in his hand. Is he invincible? No, of course not, but he has a much better chance of putting up a good fight and going home whole at the end of the day.There are many things in our lives over which we have no control. Illness, accidents, and bad genes may be our unavoidable lot, but there are many things we CAN control including how we take care of ourselves.

{"title": "A very tired 6.5 miles", "date": "Wednesday, March 23, 2011", "text": "My wakeup heart rate was 55, and I felt pretty good. However, as soon as I started running, I could tell I was tired. There was a 10 mph headwind, and I thought that might be causing me to be tired. I slowed down and ran for shorter distances before I walked. I was looking forward to having a tailwind after I turned around, but after I had gone about half a mile, the tailwind stopped. Oh well, I thought, at least it isn't a headwind. On the way back I took several rest breaks of about a minute each.During my return, my nose started to drip, and I realized I was coming down with a cold. I've been thinking about possible reasons why I might be coming down with a cold. I haven't been exposed to someone with a cold, and I've been sleeping very good. Colds are one of the symptoms of over doing it, and my guess is that is the cause of my cold. Two days ago I ran against the strongest headwind I've experienced in 38 years of running, and that effort likely put a lot of stress on my body.In addition, I've been adding stress to my body in two ways: increasing my total distance and increasing the amount of running before I walk. I've been adding 0.5 miles to my total distance every couple of weeks, and I'm going to just increase my distance once a month. This will allow my body to adapt more to the increases in distance. I've been adding 1 left-foot-step to my running before I walk. I had gotten up to 90 seconds of running, and I'm going to drop back to 75 seconds and hold that value constant until I stop adding to my total distance. In other words, I'm going to allow more time for my body to adapt to increases in stress. When I was younger, I could handle stress better, but I'm older and have to treat my body accordingly.The weather today was almost perfect for running: temperature in the low 60s (F) and lots of sun.

I've never run with such a strong headwind! I fought the wind for a mile, and then I slowed down and took longer walks. I was glad to reach the turn-around point and to have the gusts pushing me forward instead of backward. On the way back, some of the gusts were so strong that I was almost sprinting due to the wind pushing me. I tried to slow down, but the wind just kept pushing me to greater speeds.When I started the run, I could see the bottom of the Wasatch mountains (the tops were covered by clouds), but by the time I had turned around, the storm was entering the Salt Lake valley, and the Wasatch mountains were completely covered by clouds. It rained most of the way back -- not a heavy rain but the wind blew the rain drops and made it seem like a heavy rain. The air temperature was in the low 50s (F), and I had no problem keeping warm. I wore long pants and three layers on my core. My nylon jacket does a great job stopping the wind, but as I've commented before, the jacket needs to be sprayed with silicone so it will keep the rain out.I saw a few runners, several walkers with dogs, and two cyclists. One walker stopped me and said I was brave to be out in a storm. I commented that it was easier having a tailwind rather than a headwind. I was glad he didn't have far to go to get to his car, because he had no jacket and a short sleeved shirt. I think he was the brave one. Or was he the foolish one? Were we all foolish? Nah!

However, after about two miles, my body warmed up and I felt fine during the rest of the run (not warm, just fine, meaning just a little bit cold). When a person starts running, his or her body diverts warm blood into the core of the body where the critical internal organs are, and the person's arms and legs get cold. However, after the core is warm, blood is sent to the arms and legs and they get warmer. For me, this process takes about two miles."},
{"title": "Saw a strange black bird", "date": "Saturday, March 19, 2011", "text": "During my run I saw a big black bird walking by some bushes. It was about the size of a small chicken, but it didn't look like a chicken. The body and legs were pure black. It had a small red comb, and there was a large white spot on its neck. And, it had a fan-tail. Not a fan tale like turkeys have that span 180 degrees, but a fan-tail that spanned about 45 degrees. It had a small head, and I could hardly see its beak. At first I thought it was a pet chicken that had gotten lose, but when I saw its tail, I decided it wasn't a chicken.A method of running called Chi is becoming popular. Two attributes of running-form procribed by Chi are mid-foot strike and leaning forward a bit from the ankles. I'm automatically changing from a heel striker to a mid-foot striker because I run a fast stride rate of about 180 steps per minute. A faster stride rate means I take smaller steps, and (for me at least) smaller steps mean I hit the ground with my mid-foot instead of with my heel.A few days ago I was reading about Chi, and I read that I should lean slightly forward (from the ankles not the waist) so that gravity will pull me forward. I've been trying that, and it really works. I run faster and with less effort due to the effect of gravity on my body. By leaning forward slightly, my center of gravity is slightly in front of my feet, and that causes gravity to pull me forward instead of just pulling me down. It doesn't take much of a lean to get the benefit of gravity. In fact, if I lean forward too much, I'll fall down. The risk of falling down is even greater when I'm going down a hill. By taking smaller steps, due to a fast stride rate, my foot hits the ground when the leg is moving backward, and this means my leg isn't doing all of the work to propel me. It is just lightly touches the ground to keep me moving."},

A lack of sleep is a common reason for my wakeup heart rate to be high, but I've been getting good sleep most of the recent nights. My normal wakeup heart rate is 50-53.During the second mile, I picked up several pieces of litter, probably consuming a minute for that \"duty\" of a good citizen. If you zoom in on the graph of my run (as explained in the next paragraph), you'll see several blips to the left or right of the path when I left the path to get litter.Here is a graph of my run today. The data for the map was collected by my new Garmin Forerunner 110 GPS and was uploaded to my free account at the Garmin Connect web site. If your mouse has a wheel, you can use the wheel to zoom in for a closer view of the map; if no wheel, use the +- in the upper left part of the graphic. If you zoom in and look at 106th South (Jordan River Parkway), you'll see the detour I had to make due to the tunnel under the street being flooded. If you stay zoomed in and look at 114th South, you'll see where I crossed the river on a new Parkway-path bridge and continued my run in the city of Draper. In the lower right corner of the graph, you'll see a View Details button that you can click to get of gory details about my run."},

No wind, and it was a great day for running (and walking and cycling).I was curious to see how far I could run without walking, and I made it to the 0.25 mile mark. At that point my legs were just starting to feel tired. I then ran 132 left-foot-steps and walked 66 lfs for the next two miles. By then I was definitely getting tired, and I dropped to 66 lfs running and 45 lfs walking.The Jordan River is still high, and the tunnel under 106th South is still flooded. Rain is forecast for Wednesday through Friday, so the river will continue to be high and the tunnel will continue to be flooded."},

However, after 0.25 miles I knew I had to walk a bit. There was a 10-15 mph head wind, and that helped sap my energy. I walked for about a minute and then ran for about 0.15 miles and had to walk again. I switched to running 230 left-foot-steps and walking 66 lfs and did that for about three miles. I then switched to running 66 lfs and walking 50 lfs and completed the six miles. I did take several short sitting breaks on the way back.I'm not surprised that I couldn't repeat my running of 1.5 miles. Running 1.5 miles with no walking is a big increase in stress from the alternating of running and walking that I have been doing. Our bodies don't handle big increases in stress very well.I think that I would like to increase the amount of running that I'm doing, but I don't want to do it in one big jump like I did on Monday. I've been adding 1 lfs each time I run, but I think I'll try adding 2 lfs each time I run and keep the walking the same (66 lfs).The temperature today was in the mid 60s (F). Just three days ago the daytime temperature was in the mid 30s and we had 5 inches of snow at night. Today, all of the snow on the ground is melted. I just hope the snow pack in the mountains doesn't melt fast. If it does, we'll likely have floods."},

I didn't stop for a rest and I didn't walk. I started my run, planning on doing a 5-mile rest run/walk, like I've been doing, alternating about a minute and a half of running and a minute of walking. However, I felt pretty good and thought I'd see how far I could run before I had to walk. When I got to the small hill at 0.6 miles, I thought I'd see if I could make it to the turn around point at 0.75 miles. I reached that point and decided to see if I could make it back to the parking lot -- I did, and I felt pretty good.It was raining during my run. Not a heavy rain but a steady run. On the way back I noticed a few snow flakes mixed in with the rain, and by the time I got back to the parking lot it was all snow and was coming down pretty good. I decided I had pushed my body enough with a no-walk run, and I aborted the 5-miles and went home. Also, the temperature during my run was 35 (F), and I wanted to get home before the Parkway path and roads started to freeze. It snowed for a couple of hours after I got home. I haven't checked outside, but we probably have an inch or two of wet snow. I really need to get a can of Silicone spray and do my nylon pants and jacket. The rain and snow went right through the pants and jacket, and I was wet when I got in the house.11:33 PM: I just checked outside, and it's still snowing. There is about 5 inches of snow. I'm glad I ran today and won't be running tomorrow. My next running day will be on Thursday."},

Today I'm rid of the bandages, rid of the compression stockings, I've lost 28 pounds of weight, and I'm running not quite a minute and a half and walking a minute for a total distance of 6 miles twice a week and 5 miles once a week. Yes, a lot has happened during the past two years.We all have our trials that we go through. During the trials we think they will never end, but once they're over we realize they weren't so bad after all. Trials in life are part of being human and are actually good for us, because, if we endure them, they help us gain strength and be better people. Of course, if we don't endure and give up, our trials can sink us (actually we sink ourselves).You do 16 runs  and what do you getAnother day older and stronger, you betSaint Peter don't you call me 'cause I can't goI'm doing my next run even tho I'm slow.Speaking of being slow, during my run today I passed a lady and her two dogs (she was going north and I was going south). About a quarter mile later I turned around and headed north. I passed the lady while she was stopped so she could talk on her cell phone. I completed that running-segment and started walking. Guess what? She passed me. As soon as I started running again, I passed her. I am a slow walker because I'm resting during my walks, and it's common for walkers to pass me while I'm walking.I ran for 129 left-foot-steps and walked for 16 lfs. I stopped twice to  rest for a minute, after 3 1/4 miles and again after 5 1/4 miles. The temperature during my late-afternoon run was in the low 50s, (F) and it was a great running day. I started with 2 layers of clothing but took my nylon jacket off during the middle of the run and then put it back on towards the end of the run. I wore a long sleeved cotton T-shirt under the jacket, and just the T was about right for the middle of the run.  Today I ran back and forth north of 106th South instead of south of 106th South like I did earlier in the week.Even though I've been sleeping well, my wakeup heart rate is around 60-62. I don't know why it's high, but it does indicate my body is tired. I guess increasing my distance, even though it's less than 5% average increase per week, is having more impact on my body than I realized.The tunnel under 106th South is still flooded, although the sump pump in that tunnel is working 24/7. We're scheduled to have some rain this evening, and that may help keep the tunnel flooded for a while. The water in the tunnel looks like it is 6 inches deep or so, and it will likely be several weeks before the water in the tunnel is gone."},

A great day for running! I ran 128 left-foot-steps and walked 66 lfs for the whole 6 miles with no rest stops. I used my running shorts, a long-sleeved cotton T-shirt, and my nylon wind breaker (2 layers).When I got into the Draper section of the path, next to the bridge at 123rd South, there was a lot of trash that had blown in. I found an empty lawn plastic bag that had blown against a bush, and I used that to hold the trash I picked up. I focused on the west side of the path, between the bridge and a playground about 1/4 mile north, and picked up most of the trash. When I finished, the lawn bag was pretty full, thanks to several large pieces of trash. On another day I'll get the trash on the east side of the path.The Jordan River is still high; in fact, it looked slightly higher than it was last week. The water is almost up to the Parkway path when the path goes under the new bridge at 114th South. The path under the bridge at 123rd South is still flooded and may remain flooded for most of the summer. That's too bad, because that will make it harder to get really long distances on the Parkway."},

I ran a mile to the tunnel under 106th South, and it was flooded due to drainage from the grass area next to the tunnel and to high water in the Jordan River. I knew the tunnel under 123rd South would be flooded due to the high water, so I wasn't surprised that the 106th South tunnel was flooded.I turned around and went north until the path ends at the West Jordan City boundary, and then I went south again to finish my 5-mile run.The temperature was in the mid 40s (F), and it was a pleasant day to be outside. The sky was mostly overcast with very high clouds, but there were moments when the sun peeped out for a few minutes.The Salt Lake valley is in a bowl with the Wasatch mountains on the east, smaller hills on the north and south, and the Oquirrh mountains on the west. Because of this bowl, the Salt Lake valley frequently has winter temperature inversions that make the valley seem like it is in London fog. Today, though, the air was clean and crisp, and as I ran along the Jordan Valley Parkway, I had a beautiful view of the Wasatch mountains, all covered with snow. Going from south to north and from highest to lowest, there is Mt. Timpanogos (11,500 feet), Lone Peak, Twin Peaks, and Mt. Olympus that is in the center of the valley. The hills around Salt Lake City are lower and not particularly attractive. The four peaks I mentioned are a  spectacular site, and today's view was especially nice due to the fresh snow on the mountains. I'm sure the skiers at Utah's world-famous ski resorts are having fun in the snow.There is a joke about a visitor to Utah who saw the snow-covered mountains and asked if the mountains were covered with salt from the Great Salt Lake."},

I finally got the door open and started the car, using my hands not my fingers to turn the key and start the motor. While the car was warming up, I nibbled on an energy bar.

A slight breeze that was a head wind going out and a tail wind coming back.I drove to the East Pavilion in South Jordan and then ran south and back. There was a lot of trash along the path in the Draper section, and I picked up a big bag full. The Jordan River was high, and the path going under 123rd South was flooded and I had to turn around before my planned turn-around point (I made up the 1/3 mile at the end of my run). My legs did start to feel tired on the way back, and I switched from running 125 left-foot-steps and walking 66 lfs to running 66 lfs and walking 40-50 lfs.I wore my new Saucony shoes for this run, and they performed well. They felt comfortable, and I have no blisters. I also wore my new Pearl iZUMi T-shirt for the first time. Being a turtle neck with a zipper, it felt warm, and I actually had to unzip the shirt to allow for air to flow under the shirt and cool me off a bit.The water-level in the Jordan River was high today. The water in the river comes from Utah Lake, and there is a pumping station at the north end of the lake. The level of the river is controlled by the pumping station. My guess is that they are trying to lower the water-level in Utah Lake to make room for the Spring runoff. Normally, the water level wouldn't rise until April or May. The same thing happened last year at this time, and that scheme seemed to work, because there was no flooding of the river during late spring and early summer last year. Today, the water was flowing faster than I was going, because sticks in the river were passing me.I saw a man sitting on a bench who had two big dogs of a breed that I'd never seen before. I asked him what breed of doges they were, and he said they were long-haired German Shepherd dogs. He said the dogs were being trained to be rescue dogs. His wife is a certified dog trainer, and she is training them. He is a \"walker\" and takes the dogs for walks. They were beautiful dogs."},

However, that part of the Jordan River Parkway has enough secondary light from a golf course, nearby buildings, the moon, etc. that I had no problems seeing the path.

I asked about his fishing, and he said, \"It's terrible!\" I replied, \"Well, you're having fun anyway.\" He didn't respond to my comment.During my run, I must have seen several hundred geese walking around a large grassy area. Most of the geese were within 25 feet from the path and, maybe, 50 feet from the Jordan River. The large grassy area is about a quarter mile long and contains quite a few picnic tables. It's part of the South Jordan park system. I always see geese there and at similar places. I don't see geese picking at things on the ground; they are just standing still or walking around. I don't know if the geese just like open spaces or if they find more food there than in other places. I don't know if the geese eat insects, worms, etc. or grass.

I could tell I was getting tired trying to maintain my pace against the wind, so I slowed down and did more walking.

Sometimes I feel like I am always 2 steps forward 1 1/2 steps back. Which is okay since it still means moving forward! We all have things that interrupt even the best laid training plans, slipping on ice, travel plans, etc. so it is important to be able to let those times when you can't exercise go so you don't stress over the missed workout, but you also have to see them only as a pause and not let it spiral into a new routine of making excuses.After a 3 day break from running, I was feeling pretty low. I woke up with a serious RA flare that had even my jaw so inflamed I couldn't open my mouth to eat breakfast. RA also saps your energy so the last thing in the world I wanted to do was run, but I hauled myself into the gym anyway.On the other hand, I know full well that a good run will knock the rust off and get things moving again. I stepped onto the treadmill and long story short, I managed a light 10 mile run.The best part of the story? My RA flare subsided as effectively as if I had gone to the doctor for a Kenalog shot! Endorphins are very powerful drugs, we just have to reach out and grab them with both hands. It has taken me over 3 years to get to the point where I can run for over an hour and a half and still be productive, but every step has been worth it. This is why I run.Wendy Nail (a.k.a.

I lived in Massachusetts for 17 years and experienced a lot of Chicago-like weather, especially during the mini-ice-age of the 1970s and 1980s. I think we're having it pretty good right now in Utah. Yes, it is cold, but we have no snow in the valley where people live. Those who ski, though, are having a great time 20 miles from here in the ski resorts. During the hot summer I think it would be great to live in Park City. But, right now, I'm glad to be lower down in the Salt Lake valley (our elevation is 4400 feet compared to 7500 feet in Park City)."},

During the morning we had some snow, but the air temperature was in the high 30s (F), and the snow melted almost as fast as it came down. When I left for my run about 3 pm, the shade temperature was 37 (F). When I returned from my run, the temperature was 32 (F). There was a wind of about 5 mph, and the wind-chill made it seem colder. I wore my usual three layers and long pants, and those layers were sufficient.For the first two miles, I used a ratio of 115 left-foot-steps running and 66 lfs walking. I felt great during the two miles, but I started to get tired, and I switched to 66 lfs running and 45-50 lfs walking. During the last mile, I walked most of the distance. I felt fine while walking. It was only during the running that I felt the stress of the run. During the past couple of weeks, I only did one good 5 mile run and a second run of 1.5-2 miles or so during each week. I think my performance has declined during that time, and it will take a couple of weeks to get back to doing 5 miles and feeling fine. After I reach the point of feeling fine during the 5 miles, I'll slowly increase my mid-week run and my weekend long run back to the 7 miles I had achieved about a month ago. My Monday/Tuesday run is frozen at 5 miles.Tomorrow is going to be very cold compared to today, with tomorrow evening going down to single digits. I'm thus glad I ran today."},

Maybe not back to my usual mileage or speed, but definitely back in the game.  Starting with test runs that lasted only a minute or two and working my way up from there, I ran 16 miles last week including, a 5K (race report here), a road run of 4 miles, and treadmill runs of 5 miles.  The only bummer in the mix is that it is really cold here in South Korea, it is all of 5F as I type this morning!About a week ago I had a bit of a nasty turn.  I slipped on some ice and, although I did not fall all the way down, the process of catching myself strained my hip and RA quickly attacked.  Fortunately, it bears weight fine, but it is tender when I start my runs and like breaking loose a rusty hinge if I have been seated for more than a few minutes.Injuries and RA can feel very much the same at times, but what really makes it possible to differentiate them is that arthritis (RA or OA) improves the more you move.  This is a great incentive!  When you know that pusing through the pain and discomfort will bring relief, it makes it possible to get out of the chair.  You have a light at the end of the tunnel and the more you move, the faster you will get there.Strength and flexibility are incredibly important with arthritis.  In order to deal with not being able to run, I have spent a lot of time in the gym for the last few months and recently highered a personal trainer.  Normally, and expense like that is out of reach for me, but I used my birthday money because I knew it woudl be a worth while investment.  So far we have met for the initial consultation (which was free) and she gave me a few exercises to get started improving hip strength.  This week we will do our first full workout session together, I can't wait!!!"},
{"title": "Went for a short run/walk", "date": "Saturday, January 08, 2011", "text": "Even though my wakeup pulse rate was high, I felt pretty good, and I did a short run/walk of 2 miles during the late afternoon. The sky was overcast, and the temperature was in the mid 20s (F). The first 1/4 mile of the Parkway path was covered with ice and snow covered ice, but the rest of the path was about half covered, and I was able to go on the part that was bare. I did 109 left-foot-steps running and 66 lfs walking. When I finished, I was cold but felt OK. I finished during dusk.I've noticed that during this first week of 2011, I'm feeling the cold more than I did in 2010. A month ago I would have run with a temperature of mid 20s and felt fine. Now, at that temperature, I feel like I need another layer. Three layers will likely be fine down to 32 degrees, but four layers will be needed for temps in the 20s and probably five layers for temps in the teens and below. Maybe in another couple of weeks I'll be recovered more and won't need more than three layers, but for now I do need more. I'm running slower than I did a few years ago, and my body generates less heat now than it did then.I didn't run this past week, because I rested from running and gave my body a chance to recover from a serious cough and drippy nose. My wakeup heart rate was in the high 60s and low 70s during the week, even though I slept well during the week. It is still high (61 this morning), indicating my body is still tired.After my last run, which was on Thursday, December 30, I slept most of the next day and a good part of the first day of 2011. I didn't eat much during that time. I had a serious dry cough that sounded bad, happened frequently, but didn't bring up much phlegm. After a couple days of that, the cough changed to a wet cough, still occurring frequently, that brought up thick gobs of dark, greenish mucus. I started to get my energy level back, and I ate more food. After 2-3 days of the wet cough, it changed back to a dry cough that, infrequently, brought up small gobs of yellowish mucus. My energy level and my appetite continued to improve.As a user of homeopathic remedies, I've learned to interpret changes in the symptoms of my illness as good news. The changes show my body is adapting to the illness and is starting to overcome the illness. As each change in my cough occurred, I took appropriate homeopathic remedies. Homeopathic remedies don't suppress or mask symptoms. The remedies do trigger my body to take action against the illness, and the symptoms change as the nature of the illness changes.Three nights ago, a strange thing happened. I woke up, after about 3 hours of sleep, with a dry cough that wouldn't stop. It was like a continuous cough. The cough tried hard to bring up mucus, but nothing came up. I took a couple of remedies that didn't have any effect. I thought I was doomed to be awake the whole night. This was the first time I'd been kept awake by my cough. Then I tried Lachesis, and within 2 seconds the cough stopped, and I slept well the rest of the night. During the next night, I again woke up with a frequent, dry cough that wasn't quite as frequent or as intense as it was the night before. I immediately took Lachesis, but that remedy had no effect. After reviewing my homeopathic book for coughs, I took Rhus Tox, and within a few seconds, the coughing stopped, and I returned to bed and slept well. Last night the cough returned, not as deep or intense as it has been, and I took Rhus Tox, but that remedy had no effect. I took Phosphorus, and the cough went away and I slept well. I'm curious to see what happens tonight :)There is a lot of contention about the use of homeopathic remedies. I've used them for over 30 years, and I know they work for me. However, as an electrical/computer engineer, I understand the physics involved, and I understand that the remedies are so diluted that there should be no molecules of the remedy left in the tablet. So, I use homeopathy and get the benefits of that approach to medicine, but I don't understand why the remedies work as well as they do."},

I set the house thermostat to the daytime value, and I got warm and slept OK for the rest of the night. The computer room is the warmest room in the house, because it has a heat register just for that small room, and the computer and LAN equipment put extra heat into the room. I nibbled at some crackers for breakfast on Friday, but I didn't eat much during the day. I slept most of that day as well as my normal seven hours last night. I've had a cough for the past week, indicating my body-condition isn't good. That, and the stress of being hungry and running during the coldest night we've had this winter, apparently gave more stress to my body than it could handle.I think I made some mistakes on Thursday before and during the run. I hadn't eaten much during the day, so when I went running/walking my body energy was low. During the run, the temperature was about 15 (F), and a 10 mph wind was blowing. I wore the same three layers that I've been wearing for temperatures in the 20s. I think I should have added another layer, and I definitely should have eaten more during the day before the run.I feel better this morning, and I just finished a normal breakfast. My wakeup pulse rate (WPR) this morning was 67, indicating my body is awfully tired. I feel like my body is tired, too.

My nylon wind breaker is red, and my running pants are red. My white long-sleeved T-shirt wasn't tucked in and hung a couple of inches below the jacket; at a distance it probably looked like a white wool bottom to Santa coat.

We've had about a foot of snow during the past week, but it is almost all gone due to above-freezing temperatures yesterday and during the night.

{"title": "Walked 6 miles today", "date": "Saturday, December 11, 2010", "text": "In my post last Wednesday, I mentioned I would have surgery for a Basal Cell skin cancer. I had the surgery on Thursday. The surgery uses the Mohs technique of removing the cancer in layers and inspecting each layer with a microscope. My surgery required three layers and a skin graft using skin from my chest. This was the third time that surgeon has removed skin cancers. A few years ago, I had 10 skin cancers removed by a different doctor.I was told to not run for a week to decrease the risk of bleeding but that I could walk. I thus walked today. I decided to walk for the same time I ran last Wednesday, and I walked 6 miles. I felt fine during and after the walk. My walking pace was 21-22 minutes per mile. Normal walking is 20 mpm, so I was walking a bit slower than \"normal\". My walking seemed pretty fast to me, but my wife says I am a slower walker than she is.The temperature during my walk was in the low 50s (F) and the sky was overcast.

I had planned to run 6.5 miles again, but I decided that with the lower heart rate I might be able to do 7 miles. I did run 7 miles and had a great run. At around 3 miles I started getting tired, and I took a rest break for a couple of minutes at the 3-mile marker. On the way back, I took another break at that same bench. I took a third rest break with 1.5 miles left to go.I'm not pushing for speed, but I did run about a minute per mile faster during the first two miles and last two miles. I did about 3/4 of the run at 102 left-foot steps running and 66 steps walking. During the last part of the run I changed to 66 lfs running and 45-50 lfs walking. I was getting tired by that time, and reducing the length of my running and walking segments helped a lot. I finished the run OK, in fact my last two miles were faster than the two miles that preceded them.Today was a great day for running. During my run, the temperature was in the high 30s  (F). The sky was cloudy. Most of the snow had melted, and for several miles it was like I was running in the early Spring. The path was clear of ice and was mostly dry.In looking back on my run, I'm not quite ready for the faster pace that I ran during the first two miles. However, that is the pace my body set, and I went with it. The fact that I was able to maintain that pace for the first two miles and the last two miles was a good sign. However, I was pretty tired when I finished and climbed into my car. I ate an energy bar before I drove away; the energy bar (hopefully) helps my body begin its recovery.Tomorrow I go in at 8 am for surgery for a Basal Cell skin cancer, and that might set my body back a bit.I drove to the South Jordan East Pavilion to begin my run, and I was able to get into the territory that I ran when I was in half-marathon training three years ago. It was nice to revisit the area of the path than I ran back then. There is a large, empty concrete silo that is at the bottom of a large hill. Today, I didn't quite make it to that silo. I stopped in the middle of an area that will become at some future time a wetlands for wild birds.I forgot to mention that during my run on Monday, on the 1.5 mile segment (round trip) that goes north from the 9900 entrance to the Parkway, I saw about 20 or so new trees that had been planted along the path. I'm guessing they are Cottonwood trees since Cottonwoods are native to the area. Right now there are a lot of Russian Olive trees along the path, but those trees aren't native. In about 15 years the Cottonwoods will be big enough that the caretakers of the Parkway can start to thin out the olive trees.I also saw during my run today quite a few trees that had been planted along the path. However, these trees are on the other side of the fence, and the trees left the path and followed the fence away from the path. That is an open area that gets a lot of wind, and the land-owner might have planted them as a wind-break."},

I consider 53 my \"normal\" rate. This means that my body recovered from my long run on Thursday. I've been getting 7-7 1/2 hours of sleep each night, and that helps a lot.I mentioned in my last post that I was considering making small weekly changes in the number of left-foot-steps before I walk. I was considering adding 2-3 steps each week. After thinking about it, I decided to do it differently, and I tried out my new scheme on my run this morning. My new scheme is to add 1 lfs on my Wednesday/Thursday run and another lfs on my Friday/Saturday run. The total for the week is the same both ways, but my new way smooths out the change during the week. I tried the new way this morning and ran 101 lfs and walked 66 lfs.The weather during my run was cloudy with temperatures in the mid to high 30s (F). Most of the ice on the Parkway path has melted, and I only encountered three patches of black ice. When I first started the run, I carefully looked at each wet spot to see if it was water or ice, and they were all water. I thus gave up looking for ice and just ran and enjoyed being outside. Then, all of a sudden my two feet slid. I immediately stopped running and recovered my balance. I didn't go down. I started examining the wet spots again and found two more spots that were ice. I stopped and walked across the ice (these spots were pure ice with no snow on them).As I did on Thursday, I ran the full 6 miles with no rest stops."},

The temperature was 27 (F) when I left home and in the mid 30s when I returned. My wakeup heart rate was 58. I thought it would be lower since I've been getting about 7 1/2 hours of good sleep night. Apparently, my body is still recovering from my snow shoveling a few days ago. I left home just before the sun came over the Wasatch mountains, and most of my run was in the sunshine. I only saw one walker (saw him at the beginning of my run) and one runner (saw her about 3/4 through my run).Most of the Parkway path was clear, and it was a pleasant day for running. I wore my usual three layers, but I didn't wear gloves. Instead of gloves, I kept my hands inside the sleeves of my windbreaker. My fingers did get cold, as expected, but after I had gone 3 miles, they felt fine. It usually takes about 2 miles for my fingers to begin feeling better and 3 miles for them to feel fine. I wore my wide-brimmed hat instead of a knit cap, and my face and ears felt fine. In my previous run, I started running for 100 left-foot steps (I had been using 96) and walking my usual 66 lfs. During this run I continued the new number of lfs while running. I've been thinking that instead of increasing my lfs by 5 or so every 3-4 weeks, I would make a smaller increase each week. I may try 102 lfs next week and see how it goes.Looking into the future, I should be running 6 1/2 miles by the end of the year, and I might be running 7 miles if things go well. My Monday/Tuesday run is capped at 5 miles as a rest run, and my Wednesday/Thursday run will be capped at 7 miles as a mid run. My Friday/Saturday run will be capped at 10 miles as a long run. Eventually, I'll move the mid run up to 90-10 miles and the long run up to 13+ miles.During my run, I saw something in the Jordan River that I hadn't seen before. Over a mile of the river was full of Canadian geese! Usually the river has a lot of ducks. The sun was just coming over the Wasatch mountains when I saw the geese. On my way back, the geese were all gone from the river, but I saw a hundred or so of them on the lawn near the East Pavilion. Apparently the geese spent the night on the river and then left for the day. I think of Utah having cold winters, but apparently our winters are warmer that Canadian winters, warmer enough that the geese go south to Utah for the winter.The following picture is from the web, but it shows what the geese looked like this morning as they left the river as I ran past them.The Salt Lake valley has had over two feet of snow during the past three weeks (significantly more than we usually get in November). The first storm dumped about 15 inches of wet, heavy, snow on a Sunday morning. I spent almost four hours shoveling my walks and driveway. I took it slow and paced myself while shoveling, but I was really tired when I finished. The second storm dumped about 15 inches of light, fluffy, dry snow, and I was able to finish my shoveling in about two hours. I was tired, but not like I was the week before. I had enough energy left that I was able to help my neighbor shovel her driveway.During the past two weeks, the low temperature during the night was about 0 (F), and the daytime high was in the mid 20s (F).I don't like to run on ice, and I was glad that the cities quickly removed most of the snow from the Jordan River Parkway.

Most of the path is clear, but there are still places where the path is covered with ice. I could tell that some of the ice has melted since my last run on Thursday. I didn't see any other runners on the path, but I did see several walkers.  One guy was stopping often to look at birds through his binoculars, and he had a paperback bird guide in his pocket.I had a breakfast of French Toast and orange juice about an hour before I left, and I could tell I wasn't ready to run. I need at least two hours after eating before I run. However, my run went OK. I didn't feel nauseous, just sorta bloated. However, I felt fine towards the end of my run.My wakeup heart rate was 61. That is almost 20% higher than my \"normal\" of 53, and I decided before I left I would only do 2 miles instead of my planned 4 miles. However, after I had done 1 mile, I felt fine and decided to add another 1/2 mile (giving me 3 miles for the run). I felt fine during and (so far) after the run, but I'm glad I didn't go for 4 miles. My goal is to feel fine at the end of my run, and I reached that goal today. If I had run 4 miles, it is likely that I would have been tired at the end.Before my blood clots in January 2009, I could run three or four miles and not even think about the distance. Then, after my blood clots, it was a struggle to do anything. I've been slowly increasing my distance by alternating running and walking, and I've noticed recently that I'm able to run 2-3 miles without even thinking about it. This indicates that my endurance is getting back to my pre-blood clot levels. I have my distance up to 5.5 miles, half running and half walking, and I hope to be up to 6 miles or maybe 6.5 miles by the end of the year."},

There was ice on the path, mostly in shady spots, and most of the ice was covered with a thin layer of snow that was blown onto the path. I ran on the dry spots, jogged on the snow covered ice, and walked on the bare ice.I ran my planned 2 miles and enjoyed the cold crisp air and wonderful sunny sky. I wore my normal three layers for winter running, and I used a dry pair of stockings for my hands. I wore my wool ski cap, and I pulled it over my face when I started to run. It was a nice way to begin this Thanksgiving Day. During my run I saw two pairs of runners and two walkers, plus two runners on the street as I drove to the Parkway. My wife was concerned about me being alone on the path if I should slip on ice and fall. I assured her there would be other runners there, and I was glad to see them.

We are keeping on eye on the turkey and one on the news, but so far all is well.I was excited to be at the end of my prescribed rest from running, but my foot didn’t feel completely healed so I went in to see the orthopedic surgeon to be on the safe side. Unfortunately, he told me exactly what I DID NOT want to hear. 6-8 more weeks and then another doctor visit before running again. Oh yes, and walking is okay, but NO HIKING! I nearly burst into tears on the exam table. The doc was very sympathetic and concerned, and understood how I felt. He has seen me at the gym enough times to know how committed I am. I had warned him at the start that I would probably heal slowly due to the rheumatoid arthritis and medications that go with it, but he was still surprised and how true it turned out to be.It can be hard to be at the low end of the bell curve, taking longer than your peers to heal, longer to make gains in strength or speed, having to work harder to control weight or reach physical goals, but it doesn’t mean we have a free ride to give-up-city. Yes, this will likely be a 6 months break from running instead of 2 or 3, but that is what it is, a break. Not a permanent end and not a reason to quit working out. I still have the gym, spin class, and belly dancing (awesome for core work and hip flexibility). It is up to me to stay motivated and moving forward to try to minimize the losses. 6 weeks puts me on top of New Year’s Day so now I’m probably the only person I know that is anxious for the holidays to be behind me. I hope everyone has a joyous end to the year and a bright new beginning for 2011.PS For those of you who don’t feel up to the task of holiday cooking, here is proof that I’m a worse cook than any of you."},

I thought, \"This isn't bad; maybe I'll keep on going.\" Then I would reach an open space, and the full force of the wind, especially the gusts, would hit me. I decided that 2 miles was enough; time to give my body more rest.My high wakeup heart rate indicates this week should be a \"rest\" week of about 8-10 miles (maybe less).

There were a couple of times that a large gust tried to push me faster than I wanted to go, and I had to put on the breaks, so to speak. Even though I had my hat pulled down on my head as much as possible and had the chin strap tight, a large gust blew off my hat. I was worried that the wind might blow the hat down to the Jordan River, but the hat stopped at the edge of the path, and I was able to retrieve it.

After I reduced the number of my running-steps, I stopped counting my walking steps, and I just walked until I felt like running again. I probably walked for about 60 or 70 steps (sometimes more). Instead of following the route I used on Saturday, I ran north for 1.5 miles (round trip) and then south for 3.5 miles (round trip). Changing my routes gives more variety to my runs.The weather was typical Fall weather -- cloudy sky, a 5-8 mph wind, and temperatures in the mid 40s (F). I wore my nylon wind breaker during most of the run. During a mile in the middle of the run, I took the jacket off, but on the way back I put the jacket back on because the headwind felt colder than it had during the first half when it was a tail wind.

He was dragging a 5-foot lease. I thought to myself that the owner of the dog was probably coming down the path, and I forgot about the dog. However, a mile later as I was nearing the Mulligan Golf Course, I saw the dog, still running and still dragging the lease. Later after I got back to the parking lot and was finishing my stretches, I saw the dog come up the path. I whistled to it, and it came over to me. I held the dog by its collar, and I phoned a number that was on his dog tag. The owner, who lived not far away, came over and got the dog. The owner said the dog loves to run. The dog has a wire \"run\" that allows the dog to run back and forth across the back yard, and somehow the dog had gotten loose.

Every day I see older Koreans out power walking in track suits with big sun visors and running or hiking shoes. On the street to our house I frequently see a tiny little old lady on her daily walk, scooting alone with her walker. She is smiling and waving to friends, but determined in her march up the hill. I am a terrible judge of Korean age, but I dare say that they age very well and that little old lady is likely a centenarian or close to it.               Korean culture and everyday life contribute to this awareness of fitness with endless opportunities to exercise. Every block has a small park with pieces of exercise equipment we normally only see in a gym. However, Koreans do not need a special place to work out, I’ve seen cab drivers doing push-ups against their cars while waiting on fares and people doing push-ups on low walls or fences waiting for busses. They never seem to stop moving.All of this has been reinforced by my outings to Buraksan Mountain.It is a small peak in the middle of a bustling city with a surprisingly technical trail that has a huge open air fitness center in the middle of it.     You can bench press, crunch, pull up, elliptical, or do a variety of other exercises, some of which I haven’t quite figured out, (like hanging from a wheel and twisting back and forth).With places like this, there is truly no excuse for anyone not being in shape.Buraksan Mountain also encompasses several burial areas. It makes me wonder: Were they put there so family members could get in a healthy hike while visiting their ancestors, or to remind us what happens if we don’t take care of ourselves?(In all honesty, the burial mounds are likely one of the reasons this hill has not been turned into apartment complexes.)A few weeks ago, I was on the military base and samples of Ginseng were being given out in hopes of selling very expensive boxes and vials of the stuff. I found myself talking to an older American man who was raving about how Ginseng was the secret to Koreans being so healthy, fit, and aging so well. I was looking at him and thinking that the enormous beer gut he was sporting suggested that Ginseng could not cure gluttony or sloth! I have no doubt that Ginseng is healthy or at least won’t hurt you, but I’m pretty sure the secret to health and youth in Korea can be found on Buraksan Mountain.Live, love, stay fit, and be happy!

Because of the many small town I visit and the rather short distances between them, I spend a great deal of time in my car.Recently, my business has required me to travel the eastern seaboard. As an avid runner and fitness enthusiast, I've found a great way to exercise and stay fit while on the road. I regularly research running trails either online or through local parks and recreation departments and find trails that are right off the highway! Not only am I able to explore new places on foot, but it is a welcome break during my long road trips.I've spent a good amount of time on I-95 in the past year. Being cramped in a rental car for long periods of time is certainly hard on the body. Seeing the sign for the Palmetto Trail when I pulled over for gas one day gave me an idea.  Why couldn't I plan ahead and fit in a run on these trips? I decided to start leaving a little extra time so I could stop and check out some of these opportunities. There is simply nothing better for refocusing your energies and priorities than jogging outside, taking in the fresh air and sounds of nature.  This interstate has a lot to offer as it meanders from Florida, through the Carolina lowcountry, the Virginia countryside and continues north passing within easy reach of many quaint New England towns. Whether Palm Trees and Live Oaks in South Carolina or golden cornfields in Virginia, there is certain to be scenery that will take your breath away. Though I have visited many, here's a short list of some great \"run spots\" I've explored on my treks on I-95:Virginia: James River Park This park area is built into the city/urban area as a nature area for the residents to enjoy. While not exactly the raw nature that I crave and usually go for, it does have its charm in being a very pleasant piece of manicured nature inside of the city. The trail runs along the James River Waterway where you can observe fishing and small recreational boats.  There are great views of the city skyline and a run at sunset allows you to watch the city light up in preparation for the night to come.Virginia: Powhatan Trails (Wildlife Management Area) Virginia is interesting because instead of numerous national parks, they have an array of wildlife management areas. This trail is approximately 12 miles long with a variety of scenery. It begins in the forest and then opens up to wetlands and fields filled with large hedges. I was fortunate to not only see a woodpecker but I was lucky enough to also spot a Buck in the distance during my run.Florida: Retro River Run (Jacksonville Area) An old friend and fellow runner took me on this route while visiting Florida. It's a city trail, which I usually don't prefer, but this route crossed over three bridges to two different sections of Jacksonville so I was able to see a lot of the Historic City. The trail starts appropriately at the statue of “the Runner”  and goes down the Acosta Bridge.  After two miles it loops back around Main Street Bridge. In total, this is a four mile city loop which allows you to observe the interesting and intricate architecture the city has to offer.South Carolina: Palmetto Trail (Capitol City Area) South Carolina is home to the Palmetto Trail, a combination of trails in the state that run across its entire length. This section was by Capitol City; a good 7 mile trail that's a lot easier than its nearby cousin, the heavily wooded Fort Jackson Trail. This is a paved trail which uses the sidewalks of downtown Columbia. There are trail heads laid out that will guide you through different neighborhoods of Columbia as well as historical sites such as University of South Carolina and the State Capital Building grounds. And of course, if you are really ambitious you can follow this trail east to the sea or west to the mountains!Helpful Tip: Purchase a small portable GPS with a “create a marker” function, so you can mark where your car is and also mark the path you took. That way you can find your way back if the trail ends up being a little to rough or underdeveloped. Though I don't rely on other electronics, such as heart monitors, timers, or even watches, if you're exploring a new area you should be prepared. Besides being a great way to squeeze in a workout, jogging in new areas is also an excellent way to kill time when the inevitable traffic jam hits!I took the fitness route a little late in life; although I did play basketball and just about every other sport all through school and college, it was more on a casual basis and not in an effort to increase my stamina or get healthy. The last thing on your mind as a teenager is the drive to play a sport as a form of exercise or to get fit. It’s when you reach your late 20s and begin to see the gradual changes around your hips and thighs, when friends teasingly comment on how round and chubby your face looks these days, when you see a stranger looking at you from the mirror, when the button on your jeans refuses to shake hands with the fastener on the other side, and when the bathroom scales groan even as you walk past them, that you realize you must do something drastic to regain the figure you carried all those years ago.And so I looked around for the best ways to lose weight; I tried dieting, but that didn’t seem to last long – it’s extremely hard to gulp down bread and soup when those around you are gorging on delicious food with nary a care in the world. For a while you tell yourself that it’s ok if you’re a little plump, and forget your resolution to lose weight. But when you huff and puff to climb the stairs to bed every night, the nightmares of looking like an elephant wake you up at 5 am and you hit the roads for a jog. Things were on track for a day or two, after which the toll of waking up before it’s daylight and the aches and pains in your legs lull you to shut off the alarm and turn over to go back into the land of slumber.I realized I needed a plan, one that would enable me to stick to my resolution to lose weight, come hell or high water. I looked around for a sport I could play and found a squash club on my way to work. Not satisfied with my daily hour of the game, I cajoled a friend into joining me during my morning jog. The power of two was definitely greater than one, as each of us motivated the other and had bets going on who was going to register the first 5 lbs loss. I also invested in an exercise bike and combined my TV times with at least 10 miles of cycling.The biggest motivator of course was the reading on the scales – when I saw that I had lost a couple of pounds more than my target, I cut down on my calorie intake in an effort to expedite the reduction process. I started eating just fruits and salads for dinner. I did reap the rewards of my labor a year later when I found that I lost around 40 lbs. Changes in my life did not allow me the freedom of devoting more than an hour to exercise every day, but the new me balked at going back to the pudgy person I had been a year ago. I had to decide which of my activities I wanted to keep and which I had to sacrifice. It was a tough choice, but I went with squash and gave up the rest.When someone asks me how I stayed motivated all year long, I have only this to say:Choose something you love – I enjoyed squash the most, which is why I chose to retain it as a part of my life.Vary your routine so that it does not get monotonous – I had more than  one activity going simultaneously, so if I got bored with one, I would just spend more time at the other.Don’t give up until you start to see a change in the way you look and feel  – once you reach this stage, you’ll never look back.Get someone to exercise with you – it’s harder to stop when you know someone else is dependent on you.Go ahead then and exercise; it’s never too late to start, and always too soon to quit before you’ve seen results.Today's run was a duplicate of Monday's run. Almost the same wakeup heart rate. Same route. Same distance. Same performance, getting tired after 2 miles. Same weather, sunny, temperature in the low 60s (F), and a nice day. More people on the path, though. I didn't carry water with me, but I had a bottle of water in my car and took drinks at the beginning and ending of my run.I saw a garter snake in the rocks at the South end of the tunnel under 106th South (probably one of the snakes I saw a few days ago). It disappeared in the rocks and then stuck its head out of another hole and looked at me. The snake is about the diameter of my little finger and about 2 feet long.I saw a cross-country skier. We have no snow, of course, and he had wheels on his skis. He was pushing himself with his poles, the same as he would do with snow. He should have strong arms by the time snow arrives and he does it for real.I've noticed during the past few runs, that a particular muscle in my left leg became tight at around 4.7 miles. In previous days, the tightness only lasted a couple of minutes. Today, the tightness came at about 4.8 miles and didn't go away until I was home. As soon as the tightness occurred today, I stopped running and tried to stretch it out. It remained, and I walked slowly the last 1/4 mile to my car. Before getting in the car, I did my usual post-run stretches, but the muscle was still tight. After I had been home for an hour, I noticed the tightness was gone. The muscle is on the back of my leg, right where the ham strings join my buttocks. I don't think it is an injury; probably a muscle that needs more time to adjust to the 5-mile distance."},
{"title": "To run or not to run, that is the question!", "date": "Wednesday, November 03, 2010", "text": "While running today, I was thinking about my training. My wakeup heart rate has been high for the past couple of weeks, usually 60-63. Monday for example, it was 63. Today it was 62. My base wakeup heart rate is 53. A 20% increase would be 63.4, and my basic philosophy is not to run when my wakeup heart rate has a 20% increase or higher. Based on that philosophy, I should not have run on Monday and today.I did run, however, on both days. I thus had an important decision to make.a. I could not run and thus give my body extra rest.b. I could ignore my wakeup heart rate and push on with my normal training.c. I could run but give my body extra rest during my run.On both days, I chose option c. I did keep my normal running of 96 left-foot steps, but as my body got tired, I increased my normal walking of 66 left-foot steps.  Sometimes I took 70 or so left-foot steps, and other times I took 96 left foot steps. Also, sometimes I didn't count steps and just walked until I felt ready to run. I also took rest stops, sometimes standing and sometimes sitting on a bench. By giving my body extra rest, I was able to complete my planned distance of 5 miles with about half of that distance while I was running and half while I was walking.In terms of injury, the safest option is option a, not running at all and giving my body extra rest. The next best option is option c, running but giving my body extra rest by increasing the amount of walking, or (which I didn't do this week), aborting the run when I started getting tired and walking/jogging back to my car.The worst option (one which many runners choose) is to ignore my body telling me it's getting tired and pushing on with my normal training. That option puts runners on the path to injury. It's better to lose a little running and avoid injuries rather than to lose a lot of running after an injury occurs."},

The visible peaks in the Wasatch mountains are snow covered (about 1/3 of each mountain). I ran 5 miles again, going south from 100th South.I felt fine during the first half but was tired coming back. I kept my ratio of running and walking of 96 steps running and 66 steps walking for most of the run, but during the last half mile I switched to 46/33. Running the shorter distance before I walk helps, because I walk before getting really tired from running.I haven't been carrying water with me, because I've been getting drinks from the fountain at the East pavilion. However, I found out today the fountain has been shut off for the winter. I knew that would happen, but I hoped it wouldn't happen for a couple more weeks. I had eaten a banana, two energy bars, and two small packages of gummy fruit just before I left, and I needed some water. Oh well, I'll start carrying water again."},

The weatherman said it was lake effect from the Great Salt Lake. When I left to go running  in the early afternoon, the shade temperature was 41 (F), but the sun temperature was probably in the low 70s, and the snow was almost all gone. The Parkway path had no snow.I really enjoyed the run, even with a high wakeup heart rate of 62 and only 6 hours of sleep. It's been a week since my last run, and I think the week of rest was good for me. I purposefully didn't run on Saturday because I wanted to give my body more rest, and I missed Monday's run due to schedule conflicts. The cool weather probably helped, too. I was sweating around my hat, but I wore my nylon jacket, and I felt comfortable.During my run I passed a guy who was sitting on a bench enjoying the afternoon sun and reading a book. As I passed him, I thought, \"A nice way to spend an afternoon\". On my way back I passed him again, only this time he wasn't on the bench. He was walking slowly on the Parkway path reading as he walked. Seeing him brought back memories of my childhood, when I would walk 3/4 mile to the library, check out a book, and then read it while I walked home. As I passed the guy, I commented that he must have an interesting book. He stopped and showed me his book -- a book on Greek philosophy. He said the book helped him keep his sanity."},

{"title": "I've run 10 miles this week, 5 more to go", "date": "Wednesday, October 20, 2010", "text": "On Monday when I first ran 5 miles, I started at 100th South and ran across the new narrow bridge across the Jordan River to the point where the new path joins the old path (about a hundred yards past the bridge. I ran 5 miles today, but I drove to the East Pavilion and ran to the tunnel under 123th South (I went to the East Pavilion so my 5 miles would take me further south). I started getting tired on the way back, and I took one rest stop about a mile before I reached the narrow bridge. The path from the narrow bridge along the east side of the river to the playground in the city of Draper is a mixture of old path and new path. I found one spot where there is a bench made of railroad ties that is on one of the segments of old path, and I used that bench for my rest stop. There are drinking fountains at both the East Pavilion and the Draper playground.Today was another beautiful day. The next two days will be great, and then a storm front will move through Utah, bringing snow in the Wasatch mountains, rain here in the valley, and temperatures in the 50s (F). We've been having temperatures in the high 60s and low 70s, but the 50s are even better for running. As long as we don't have lightning, I'll run through the rain if it comes while I out. However, Utah summer rains usually don't last more than a few minutes at a time. So far, this has been a warm Fall -- no serious frosts yet. We're still harvesting tomatoes, string beans, squash, and pumpkins. Also lettuce. Our fruit trees, though, didn't have any fruit at all. We had a wet spring with changing temperatures, and I guess the fruit trees didn't like that.Today, my run to the tunnel under 123rd South was the first time in over two years that I've been to that tunnel. I noticed two changes to the Parkway.About three years ago, the Jordan River had a lot of water during the summer, and that water eroded the dirt under the Parkway path at a spot about 100 yards north of the 123rd South tunnel. By the time the damage was noticed, the dirt had been washed away for a distance of 5 feet or so under the path, such that the path was on a dirt bridge over the washout. The path was in danger of a cave-in that would dump whom ever was on the path into the river. The river isn't more that a couple of feet deep, and an adult would likely be OK, but a small child could easily drown. The city of Riverton blocked off the path and graded a temporary path around the spot. I noticed that the temporary path has been paved with asphalt and is now the \"official\" path. The area where the erosion took place has grown over with grass, and people not familiar with the history of that section of path wouldn't never know the path had been modified.The path inside the tunnel has been improved. It is a little higher and a little wider. In addition, large rocks line the east edge of the path (inside the tunnel) to keep water from reaching the foundation of the bridge. Now, it would take a pretty high river to overflow onto the path and to continue up towards the foundation of the bridge.Draper has fixed up the playground area such that it is a nice picnic area with a playground for the kids. There are several tables around the playground (with wooden tops for shade) and grass growing around the area. Not far away is a larger playground that is maintained by the city of Riverton. This playground is on the west side of the river, and a narrow bridge connects the two playgrounds. The old Parkway path used that bridge to cross the river and continue on the west side of the river. Now, the Parkway stays on the east side of the river until it uses the new narrow bridge just south of the 114th South bridge. On one of my runs when I reach the Draper playground, I'll have to cross the river and see what improvements have been made to the Riverton playground.On Monday, as I left the tunnel under 106th South, I saw two garter snakes next to the path. I look at them and they looked at me. Then I continued my run."},
{"title": "Finally made it to 5 miles in my run", "date": "Monday, October 18, 2010", "text": "Today was a special day in my running. I increased my run to 5 miles. This is special, because now a 10% addition will be 1/2 mile or more, and that is a significant increase. Also, I'm capping my Monday/Tuesday run at 5 miles, and that distance will become a rest distance. My Wednesday/Thursday run will continue to increase until it reaches 7 miles, and then it will be capped at that distance. My Saturday run will increase to 10 miles and then be capped. That will give me a 22-mile week, the distance I was running before my blood clots in January 2009. My wakeup heart rate was 55, and I felt pretty good when I left home. I started from the 100th South entrance and ran south for 2.5 miles. I turned around about 100 feet after the narrow bridge across the Jordan River. I ran/walked 95/66 left-foot steps the whole distance. I took two sitting rest breaks, with 1.3 miles to go and with 0.5 miles to go. It was another beautiful day -- slightly warmer than last week, but fine. The shade temperature was in the low 70s (F) when I left home about 10:45 am.

I followed the new part of the Jordan River Parkway across the river and south to a non-vehicle bridge that connects playgrounds in the cities of Draper and Riverton. I didn't carry water with me and didn't have a drink until I was finished with the run. I also didn't do any sit-down rests because there weren't any benches on the new path. I used a ratio of 95/66 left-foot steps for running and walking for most of the run, but I got tired during the last mile and changed to a ratio of 45/60-70.It was nice to have a new path to explore. Eventually, I'll be able to start at 9800 South (my usual starting point), and go further south than I did today, but for now I'll have to park at the East Pavilion in South Jordan or the large playground in Riverton and go south.It was another beautiful day for running. Eventually the snow will come, so I'm really enjoying my running in these beautiful days.There is a new non-vehicle bridge across the Jordan River just south of the new bridge for vehicles. The Parkway goes under the new vehicle bridge and turns left onto the new non-vehicle bridge. The path then goes south through the city of Draper and finally joins the old path at a non-vehicle bridge that connects Draper and the city of Riverton. There are large playgrounds on both sides of the river at that point. So, now the Jordan River Parkway is continuous and finished from 14600 South north to 9400 South at the boundary of the cities of West Jordan and South Jordan.I'm glad the Parkway doesn't use the new vehicle bridge, because it would be dangerous for all if runners, walkers, cyclists, roller bladers, etc. were mixed in with automobiles, trucks, and buses on the bridge."},

Today was a wonderful day for running! I continued raising my knees a little higher, and I tried to lean slightly forward (from my ankles not my waist). I also started increasing each segment of running by going from 90 to 95 left foot steps (lfs) and taking the 66 lfs walking that I've been doing. This worked fine until I got into my last mile. I began getting tired, and I switched to 45 lfs running and 40-50 lfs walking. I didn't take any rest stops, but I did get a drink from the fountain on my way back.I found out this morning from a friend, who uses a motorized wheel chair to travel the Jordan River Parkway, that the new bridge across the Jordan River at 114th South is finished and is open to walkers, runners, etc. but not to vehicular traffic. My friend said the path I've been running goes under the bridge and then up to the bridge. On the other side (east) of the river, the path continues south and connects to the old path. In the past I've mentioned a big hill that is part of a detour around some private land. The new path on the east side of the river bypasses that detour. I'll miss the big hill though. It was a great training hill. I need to go check out the bridge and the new path, because I'm concerned about running across the new bridge once vehicular traffic is allowed."},

I added 10% to make my run 4.4 miles, my longest in 1 3/4 years.During the first several running segments, I measured my pace at a bit under 13, significantly lower than the 17 or 18 that I ran a year ago (my normal pace is 14-15).  I only kept that pace for about 3/4 mile, because I knew I wouldn't have the energy to keep it up for the full distance. It's like running a race. One has to avoid going out too fast and then running \"out of gas\" during the last half of the race. I didn't push myself to run the faster pace. It was the beginning of the run, and I felt energetic. For most of the run, I did practice lifting my knees higher.I'm still using the  90/66 ratio of left-foot steps running/walking.

I thought to myself, \"Strange. Must be something in the river.\" A  few minutes later two men came up from the river carrying a Kayak. As I  walked past them to the Parkway path, I was tempted to ask them how far  they had come on the river, but I didn't ask.A couple of years ago, I saw a Kayak floating down the river with nobody in it.

My turn-around point is at 2 miles, and I start feeling tired just before that point. I did take one rest stop during the run today, this time at about 2.7 miles into the run. It appears that my body does great for 1.75 miles, and then it starts to feel the stress of the run. 1.75 miles doesn't seem like much, but I remember a year ago that I was running/walking about 1.5 miles. And I remember January 2009 when I was attacked by blood clots and could only walk 10 feet (couldn't run at all). So, I've made a lot of progress during the past year, and I'm grateful for that progress and grateful to be alive today. I have a friend that I see on the Jordan River Parkway often. He can't walk very far, and he drives an electric cart on the Parkway. He breathes oxygen through a tube. He likes to be outside, and he notices the plants and wildlife along the river. He is doing the best that he can. That's all any of us can expect: do our best and take each day, one day at a time.I found another golf ball near the Parkway. The golf course is separated from the Parkway by a barbed wire fence, and the golfers aren't able to get their balls that go out of the course."},

The students came in three school buses. It looked like a combination of sports and nature study.I'm reminded of the time my wife and I helped chaperone a school outing to Sturbridge Village in Massachusetts not far from the Connecticut border. At the conclusion of our visit, we boarded our buses and headed back to the middle school. The other bus never appeared at the school. When that bus reached I90, it turned the wrong way and headed toward western Massachusetts. We went to our homes hoping the driver realized his mistake.

I did eat breakfast this morning because I knew I wouldn't be going out very early, and I'm sure energy from breakfast was helpful during the run.All in all, it was a nice run. I need to run the 4-mile route several times before I increase the distance. As soon as I reach 5-miles, I will cap my Monday run at that distance and let the other two runs head for 7 miles.My wakeup heart rate was 59, a little higher than it was Friday and Saturday.

{"title": "Wendy: Keep Your Groove On: Stay Fit During Recovery After an Injury", "date": "Saturday, October 02, 2010", "text": "Before I can go too much into my recovery plan, I should probably explain what I did to my foot. As I said in my last post, I over did it by adding hills to every run. Of course, at first I thought whatever had popped in my foot would heal on its own so I just rested for a few days and tried a short run once it no longer hurt to walk or jog around my living room. That short run was great at first, but ended in excruciating pain. I realized this was a serious injury and called for a visit with my doc. He made a tentative diagnosis of ligament tear, which was wrong, but he sent me on to an orthopedic surgeon who knew what to look for and diagnosed the stress fracture. Unfortunately, the time from the initial injury, to diagnosis and being placed in a boot took over a month. Yep, for a whole month I walked around on a broken foot. Once I had the boot in place, my 6 to 8 weeks in it started.Nearly everyone ends up injured at some point. Even if you are smart and do not injure yourself running, you still have the potential to step wrong off a curb, get in a car accident by no fault of your own, or be clobbered by a shopping cart on Black Friday, these things just happen. So, what to do when your usual workout routine is off the schedule? Find something, anything, to keep moving! Anyone can do it and it is tons of fun.) I also have good results using a foam roller on sore muscles and tight joints, particularly my ITBand.Rheumatoid arthritis has taught me a lot about the importance of movement even when we feel it is impossible. Are you sore all over from a marathon? Go for a walk. Stress fracture in your foot? Lift some weights. Chronic illness? Don't give up, do what you can for now and when things are on the upswing, you will improve even more.  If you are injured, do something so that once you are healed and ready to get back to training, you haven’t taken a huge step backwards. Taking advantage of an excuse to be lazy will only set you up for another injury. A forum friend said that if she had a cast on, she would just spend 6 weeks on the couch. I can only think about how much hard work it would take to get over 6 weeks of lethargy! My doc told me I can do pretty much anything I want at the gym provided I can do it painlessly and in my boot. So far that includes the upright stationary bike, elliptical trainer, stair mill (like walking up the down escalator), and almost all of the weight machines (obviously working calves is out.) I am working out 6 days a week with 5 hours a week of cardio, plus weights, and stretching, in whatevercombination meets my needs, (generally the cardio is done in 1 hour blocks.) I now have 3 weeks in the boot done, hopefully only 3 to go, and feel good about my new workout routine. I am also taking supplements of calcium, magnesium, and Vit. D, along with watching the rest of my diet (also so I don’t gain weight on my running hiatus) while staying as active as possible. With limited mobility, it is important to stay flexible too. I love doing something fun like Yoga or belly dancing (which is amazing for core muscles and hip flexibility, I highly recommend this video, anyone can do it and it is tons of fun.)  I also have had good results using a foam roller for sore muscles, tight joints, and ITBand problems.I hope no one reading this ever has an injury to contend with, but if they do, I hope they will remember this and do everything in their power to keep moving, keep fit, and stay strong!"},

I felt fine up through the 2 miles to the turn-around point. Going out, I took fewer rest stops than I did yesterday, and I used the 90/66 ratio of running and walking. However, on the way back my body gave out, and I took as many rest stops as I could find benches in the shade. During the last 0.8 miles, I gave up and walked back to the parking lot.During the past two days, I've only gotten 6 1/2 hours sleep. Today I forgot to eat breakfast or lunch, and I was running with my tank almost empty, so to speak. I ate a few handfuls of Cheerios, and a granola bar before I left, but that didn't give me many calories to run on. It seems like I never learn about eating. I get up thinking I will go run first thing, but I get busy on the computer and end up going out in the afternoon (2 pm today). I keep telling myself I need to get up and go running before I touch the computer, but the urge to read email is too strong. Today I was running tests on FeedBurner, and that kept me busy until I finally left to run. I sound like a teenager who is addicted to email, only now the teens are addicted to texting.The shade temperature when I left was 79 (F), about the same as during the past few days. It was a beautiful day to be out."},

I've been getting good sleep for the past week or so, and it looks like that sleep is finally having its effect on my body.I left home not knowing how far I would run. The rule of thumb for time needed for recovery from a race is one day per mile. Based on that I would need 3 days. Today was day 2, and I expected I would get tired and abort the run. The shade temperature when I left was 82 (F), and I used the 90/66 ratio of left-foot steps running and walking. I ran at a relatively slow pace, and I took rest breaks every time I saw a bench that was in the shade. My body felt fine, and my legs felt fine, too, although they did get a bit tired during the 3rd mile.On my way back I was thinking about a comment I made yesterday on running.about.com One guy, who is going into the Marine Corps, has shin splints and came to the forum for suggestions. Wendy, our guest blogger in this blog, said he should be sure his feet hit the ground under his center of gravity. I clarified that by saying that he should be sure his feet hit the ground behind his knees rather than in front of his knees.As I thought about that comment, I wondered how I was doing in that regard, and I glanced down at my legs and noticed my feet were hitting the ground almost under my knees. I thought that maybe I could move my knees forward a little bit, so I sorta bent my knees a bit more, and lo and behold, I started running faster. In fact I went enough faster that I was out of breath after 90 lf steps. And, not only was I going faster, it seemed easier for me to go that way instead of the low shuffle that I usually use.I thought about it and decided that I must have lifted my knees more. I know that people who sprint have to lift their knees higher to get more energy into their running, but I hadn't thought about lifting my knees higher during my slow running pace. I ran this way during the last mile of the run and felt fine at the end. I'm going to experiment with lifting my knees to see how it goes for 4 miles instead of just 1 mile."},

The sun was just coming up, and the temperature was probably in the high 40s (F), almost perfect conditions for a race. There were fewer than 100 runners and walkers.On Thursday, my last training run before the race, I took 1 hour and 6 minutes to run 3.1 miles (that time included several rest stops). Because of that, I felt that anything below 1 hour would be a good achievement. I finished in 48 minutes 3 seconds. My son and grandson, who did the 2K walk, accompanied me during the last couple of hundred yards.I didn't walk during the first half mile, and then I started alternating running and walking. I didn't count steps to control my running and walking. When my body started to feel tired, I began walking. When my body felt better, I resumed running. The course went through the city streets, and about 1/3 was slightly downhill, 1/3 was slightly uphill, and 1/3 was level. I did fine on the downhill and level parts, but the uphill part was more tiring to me, and I took extra walking breaks. The good news is that I didn't stop running to take a rest break. I think the low temperature was a significant part of my doing better on this run.I like small races, especially if I know the people participating. In this case, I didn't know anyone except my son and grandson, but I enjoyed the small-town atmosphere.Here is  a video of me finishing the race and of some of the prizes that were given out afterward. My number (657) was drawn, and I received a nice shoulder bag."},

You are an inspiration!      Allow me to introduce myself, my name is Wendy, I have been running since spring of 2007, am 41 years old, mother of 2, Air Force wife, live in South Korea, and have Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). The last detail is the biggest challenge to my running, but I haven’t let it slow me down. I believe everyone has a challenge that they must overcome to be able to run and what it takes to overcome it is largely the same whether the challenge is working your running around a busy life, or a medical condition. We all have the potential to succeed or allow ourselves to stack up excuses and walk away.       Currently, my biggest impediment to running is pretty concrete, albeit temporary. I had been running for 3 years in a coastal town where it was flat as the proverbial pancake, so when we arrived in Korea in late July, I was thrilled to have the opportunity to conquer hills! I was so excited that I did not stop to think how much intensity hills were adding to my runs and the result was two stress fractures in my right foot less than 2 weeks after our arrival.       Over the next few months, I will be blogging about my training plan, progress, goals, and setbacks. Once the injury is behind me, I will continue with stories of my experiences here in Korea as a runner with RA, and how I run barefoot every chance I get.       If you are interested, the back story about my life with RA and how I got started running it is all in my blog, starting with my earliest posts from 2008. My journey as a barefoot runner, starts in May 2009.Even though I had 7 hours sleep last night, my body is still tired. My wakeup heart rate was 60 this morning."},

I mentioned in my previous post that during the last mile of that run I went to a 45/33 ratio of running and walking. I used that ratio during most of the run today. I didn't have a lot of energy during the run, but I felt OK. On Monday my legs were the limiting factor in my running. Today it was mostly my body that was tired. I had a good 7 hours sleep last night, but I need more nights of good sleep to help my body recover.The temperature during my run was in the mid 70s (F), there was a slight breeze blowing, and there were lots of clouds in the sky but lots of sun, too.

I crawled under the railing lining the path and got the ball. Then I saw another ball a few feet away and further into the trees. I got that and saw another one a few more feet away, still in the trees. I ended up getting 6 balls in those trees. I tossed them onto the golf course. I had one ball left to toss when a dad and two 5-6 year old sons came into view. I tossed the last ball close by them and yelled that there were more balls over about 20 feet away.

I carried water (1 cup per mile) and used it, but it was still hot. When I reached the last mile, I could tell I had no energy, and I walked most of that mile, doing a bit of jogging at the first of the mile. I have a slight cold, and that probably has reduced my energy-level. There are two reasons I get colds -- pushing myself too hard in my running, and not getting enough sleep. My problem has been the sleep. I've been getting 5-5 1/2 hours each night, and I need 7 hours. My sleep deprivation finally caught up with me, and my nose started dripping yesterday afternoon.

I walked for a couple of minutes to recover, and then I went into my 70 left-foot steps running and 45 left-foot steps walking that I had used a couple of weeks ago. During my last half-mile, I went into the 90 lfs/66 lfs that I used last week. I rested several times going out and coming back.I didn't take water with me, and I was thirsty during the run. At about the 1.7 mile point, I drank from the fountain that I've spoken of during the past few days, both going out and coming back. My turn-around point is at the 1.87 mile point. The shade temperature was 85 (F) when I left home, and I should have taken water with me. I knew the fountain was there, and I looked forward to drinking from it.  Because of the extra distance to the fountain and back, I actually went 3.85 miles total.During the evening, my wife and I walked around the block, about 0.6 miles.

For quite a while I've been doing 30 seconds running and 30 seconds walking (45 left-foot-steps running and 33-left-foot-steps walking). Last week I increased the segments to 70 lf-steps running and 45 lf-steps walking. Today I went to 90 lf-steps running and 66 lf-steps walking. That is double what I've been doing for quite a while. This shows my endurance is getting better.I felt fine during the run. I didn't carry water because the shade temperature was in the mid 60s (F) and most of the path was in the shade due to a lot of clouds in the sky. I made no rest stops and only made one water stop (on the way out) to drink from the fountain that I've mentioned in recent posts (no water stops on the way back). All in all, today was one of the best runs I've had in quite a while. I had a good 7 hours sleep last night. My wakeup heart rate was 60, high due to sleep deprivation the past few days. It was a great day for being outside, too!On the way out I saw 8 or 9 quail on the path in front of me. As I approached, they went into the bushes. The quail were large, and I assume they were from a litter that was born early in the spring. On the way back, I saw a mother quail and a smaller youngster. That youngster was born later in the spring since it is smaller than its mother. Actually, I can't tell the difference between male and female quail, and I'm assuming the adult quail were females."},
{"title": "Ran 3.75 miles & continued running farther", "date": "Monday, September 06, 2010", "text": "I added a quarter mile to my run, and I continued the longer running that I did on Saturday. A cold front is going through Utah, and the temperatures are significantly cooler than they were on Saturday. The shade temperature during my run was in the low 60s (F). Also, I was out earlier (10 am), and there was a lot of shade on the Parkway path. I felt fine going out but started to get tired on the way back. It wasn't a good idea to increase both my distance and longer runs. Doing that meant that my body had an increase in stress from two sources (greater distance and longer running of each segment) rather than from one source.Thanks to the Labor Day holiday, there were a lot of people,  mostly cyclists, on the Parkway. It was a beautiful Fall day -- lots of sun and lots of clouds.I've been noticing that some people swing their arms across their body while they run. As your arms move across your body, your whole upper body tends to twist. People swing their arms this way, because they keep their arms folded across their body. This type of arm-movement isn't considered good running form, because it takes extra muscle-movement and extra energy to move your arms across your body. The solution is to tuck your elbows in toward your waist such that your arms move in and out in a motion parallel to the direction you're going. By doing this, you can keep your upper body stationary and only move your hips and legs."},
{"title": "Ran 3.5 miles again but ran longer before walking", "date": "Saturday, September 04, 2010", "text": "I didn't get out until 12:30 pm (ran the Jordan River Parkway), and the shade temperature was 89 (F) when I left home. I only took two bottles of water with me, and I had to spread each bottle over 1.5 miles. Just before I reached the turn-around point, I finished the first bottle and made a slight detour to a water fountain. I filled the first bottle with water and had plenty of water on my way back.Due to the heat and the lack of shade on the Parkway path at mid-day, I stopped to rest four or five  times going out. On the way back, though, I felt pretty good and decided to run longer before I walked. For the first two segments, I ran twice as long as I've been doing (100% increase). Then I settled down for a 50% increase in my running and about a 40% increase in my walking. I continued that to the end of the run, and I felt fine, especially good since I was running mostly in direct sun at the hottest time of the day. On the way back, I took two short rest breaks.I was glad that I was able to run longer segments today. A week ago I started taking a supplement called \"L-arginine Plus\" that is supposed to increase the Nitric Oxide (NO) in our bodies. The L-arginine and L-citruline amino acids in the supplement help our bodies increase the NO in our bodies. NO is supposed to help cleanse our blood arteries and veins. I need that because an artery in my left leg is plugged up (Atherosclerotic calcification of the lower extremity arteries). In past posts, I've talked about my auto accident, the filter put in my groin area to catch blood clots, and the blood clots I had a year and a half ago. This post is the first time I've discussed the artery in my left leg being plugged up. I learned about that problem about 10 months ago when I had a CT scan of my legs, but I didn't understand the significance of it. As I've learned more about my body, I'm starting to understand that decreased blood circulation is probably the cause of my lack of endurance and my not being able to run very far before I have to walk. I've known that the broken-down filter was inhibiting my blood flow, but I knew that auxiliary blood veins around the filter were being created, and I thought those veins would restore my blood-flow. I now realize that the plugged artery in my left leg is also reducing the blood-flow. I thus started taking the supplement last week in the hope that it would help increase the blood flow. My success today indicates that that may be happening, but I need more time to see if the success continues or if it was just an isolated anomaly. For those interested, this supplement is based on the research of Dr. Louis Ignarro, who received the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1998 for his research on Nitric Oxide. His book is called NO More Heart Disease. Dr. Ignarro determined that the two amino acids were needed as a supplement to help our bodies produce NO. The supplement also includes a number of vitamins and 72 trace minerals. I got the supplement and the book from a local health food store, but the supplement is also available via the web."},

{"title": "Ran the canal road again", "date": "Wednesday, September 01, 2010", "text": "I repeated my run from Monday by running 3.5 miles on the canal maintenance road. The shade temperature was about 85 (F) during the run. My wakeup heart rate was high, about 60. I got more sleep last night, about 7 hours, but I've been in a sleep-deficit during the past week; that deficit and my mowing my lawns probably made my heart rate increase. Mowing my lawns is more tiring than my running 3.5 miles. I felt tired during the run today and did extra walking, especial in shady spots. I was out about 11 am and missed breakfast again, but I did eat a few handfuls of Cheerios before I left. I didn't take water with me, and I started getting a mile headache. Since I had no water to drink, I rested a minute or two in shady spots to help my body dissipate some heat.I saw more ducks in the canal than I did on Monday. As I walked through one shady spot about 200 feet long, I saw 22 ducklings sitting on the canal road. As I approached, the ducklings went into the water, and as soon as they entered the water, they split into two groups. I'm guessing they were from two families of ducks.A couple of weeks ago, I was walking with a grandson along the canal, and we saw two families of ducklings swimming in the canal. The ducklings were much smaller than those I saw today. As the two families approached each other, the mother of one family began hissing at the ducklings of the other family,  and she chased them away. I guess she didn't want her children mixing with those of the other family. Today, though, the two groups were mixed together while the ducklings were on the maintenance road. The ducklings were about the same size, quite large, and I didn't see larger ducks that would be the mothers. These ducklings are big enough to take care of themselves, and the mother ducks may have flown away for good.One thing I've noticed in the past is that I never see Drakes swimming in the canal with the mothers and the ducklings. I guess the Drakes are out scrounging for food or something. Before the ducklings are born, I did see pairs of ducks, one male and one female, swimming together.I saw a large crane next to the canal. It was about 200 feet away, and I didn't get a good look at it. It looked to be all gray. As I approached, the crane flew away. I haven't seen many birds other than ducks in the canal, and seeing this crane was nice.On my way out, as I passed the large Cottonwood tree that is on the bank of the canal, I put two large sticks in the water. I then continued another quarter mile to my turnaround point. On my way back I passed the sticks as they neared the tunnel under a busy city street. The sticks had traveled about half a mile from the time I put them in the water until I passed them on my way back. When I was a kid I used to float sticks in irrigation ditches, and I'm still a kid at heart."},

I solved my being tired by doing longer walks than my normal 30 steps.Some of the maintenance road that I ran today has been covered with gravel. A few years ago, the County put gravel on part of the  road, but the individual rocks were so large they were hard to run on. This time, the individual rocks were small (marble size or smaller), and they made a nice surface for running."},

I felt just over all better. My work got done faster, and I felt not as over whelmed. Don't get me wrong, some days I felt like hitting the snooze and sleeping in, but I realized that in the end that extra hour of sleep wasn't worth my health or the fact that my body was looking amazing. If you push it, it's worth it. It feels good. I ran 2 miles today, and I remembered barely being able to run to the corner. It's exciting. I want to keep building myself to one day run a marathon or something like it. I really feel like running has changed my life for the better.For me that's my ultimate goal, and I won't stop until I reach it.

I purposefully, didn't run during the week, because I figured my walking would be enough exercise. I slept well during the week, but I was really tired on Friday morning and stayed home while my wife went with our daughter and her family out to see more sights. On Thursday afternoon I had a mild headache, which I interpreted as not handling the sun very well. I tapered off on my walking during the late afternoon and, as I mentioned above, took Friday off from sightseeing.I think my favorite attraction was the Wild Animal Kingdom. Sea World and the Zoo were nice, but the animals were cooped up in relatively small areas. I liked the openness of the Wild Animal Kingdom, 1700 acres of open space and lots of exotic animals.While going down, we encountered slow traffic out of Las Vegas, and the trip took about two extra hours because of that. Nothing like driving 15 mph in the HOT California desert to make one tired and sleepy. In have two running friends in the Las Vegas/Central-California desert area, and I now have more appreciation for their having to run in the hot summer sun -- not the humid heat I had in New England, but heat like an oven! Both going and coming back, we stopped at a rest stop in the desert, and, boy, was it hot! During the short walk from my car to the building, all I could think of was getting inside.The drive back, though, was without any slowdowns, and we were glad to get home."},

I had a good 7 hours of sleep, and I felt great when I began the day. I didn't go out running until about 1 pm, and by then the shade temperature was 92 (F). I drank 3 cups of water during the run, and on the way back, I stopped several times in shady spots and rested for a couple of minutes. As I've said before, in the Summer and Winter I run to survive, and in the Fall and Spring I run for performance. In all four seasons, I run for enjoyment. I went south 1.75 miles and then came back. I think that for my next run, I'll drive to the pavilion at 108th South and run to the construction at 114 South and check it out.I really can't say for sure, but I'm hoping my enjoyment of the run today means I'm adjusting to the heat."},
{"title": "Extended my run to 3.5 miles", "date": "Monday, August 09, 2010", "text": "My wakeup heart rate this morning was 55 and I had a good 7 hours sleep. I felt pretty good, and I added a quarter mile to my distance, giving me 3.5 miles. The temperature was in the 80s (F) during my run. There were large clouds in the sky that gave a minute or so of shade whenever the sun went behind a cloud. The result of all of this is that today was a pretty good day for running. Because of the lower temperature, I used less water than I've been using. Three cups were sufficient for the 3.5 miles. Last week I used four cups for 3.25 miles.To give some variety to my running, instead of running south for half the run, I went north/south for 1.5 miles (round trip) and then south/north for 2 miles (round trip). I like the north-bound segment, because it has more trees and rushes along the river bank.I'm still doing Galloway's alternating of running and walking. I'm doing 46 left-foot-steps of running and 33 left-foot-steps of walking. However, during the last half mile of my run I was getting tired, and I changed to 20-left-foot-steps of running and 20 of walking, and that worked fine.The level of the water in the river is lower than it has been, and the  sand bars in the middle of the river have reappeared; I saw about a  dozen ducks sleeping on one sand bar.I found another golf ball next to the path and threw it back onto the  golf course. That ball wasn't on the ground when I passed that point  going south. It was there as I passed the point going north, so it  hadn't been there very long. That is the sixth golf ball that I've found  in the last couple of years. The first ball that I found almost hit me. It came across the Jordan River and landed on the path about 10 feet in front of me.A year ago there were lots of sun flowers growing near the path. This   year, though, there are almost no sun flowers. I don't know if the  lack  of sun flowers is due to the cool spring we had, or to some other   reason. There should be a lot of seeds on the ground from last   year. Maybe those seeds will sprout next year."},

I ran the 3 1/4 route again and enjoyed the run. The shade temperature was in the 80s (F) when I left and 94 when I returned. I had most of my 4th bottle of water left when I finished, and I poured it over my head when I entered the tunnel under 98/100th South to do my stretches at the end of my run.There were quite a few youngsters on bikes doing a race of some kind. I gave them a thumbs up as they passed me going north (I was going south) but they just ignored me as they went past. However, on my way back, they passed me again as they headed south, and many of them waved at me or smiled as they went past. I gave them all thumbs up. I talked with an adult who was bringing up the rear looking for stragglers, and he said the kids were doing a triathlon. Earlier they had swam 50 yards at a local gym. Then they ran, about half a mile, and now they were doing the bike part for a mile and a half. They are about 6-8 years old.I saw some quail this morning. In fact, I see quail almost every time I run. Today, they quickly went into the bushes, but most of the time they run along the path for a hundred feet or so and then go into the bushes. I've seen more this year than past years due to normal increases in their population.I also see quite a few dove. Sometimes I see swallows by the 106 South overpass; they've built mud houses on the supports for the overpass."},

The temperature had been in the 70s (F) earlier in the morning due to clouds, but the clouds were gone and the temperature was in the 80s when I ran. I took several rest stops on shady benches and almost aborted my run at the 1 1/3 mile marker. But, I decided to continue to the turnaround point.The reason I was tired was that I didn't get much sleep Tuesday night. I woke up after 2 hours sleep and couldn't go back to sleep. During Wednesday afternoon I did take a 3-hour nap, and that helped me finish the day. I did feel weak during Wednesday, though, and my stomach felt unsettled.I'm not sure why I didn't sleep well Tuesday night. I'm worried that it might have been the extra distance that I've been running. I slept well during the days I ran 3 miles, and the 1/4 mile I added was less than 10%, but maybe my body wasn't ready for it. I slept fine last night, but one night's sleep isn't enough to recover from a sleep deficit. My wakeup heart rate was 58 this morning, indicating my body was tired. My run confirmed that my body was quite tired."},

My wife and I try to live a healthy life style. Thanks to our religion, we don't smoke or drink alcohol or tea or coffee. We have two gardens during the summer and try to eat organic foods, including eggs and milk. I don't do very well in eating a large variety of veggies, so I take supplements.I'm really just an average runner, but running in my 70s  seems to be a novelty, and I'm getting into quite a few lists of blogs  -- all due to my age. Each person needs to find some way in which he/she is unique, and my way is to run into and (hopefully) through my old age.My wife went with me to the Jordan River Parkway, and she walked the north-bound segment (1.5 miles round trip) while I ran 3.25 miles round trip on the south-bound segment. We were out earlier, and the temperature was relatively cool (mid 70s (F) when we left home and 82 when we returned). The sun was behind a cloud for the first half mile, and it seemed like I was in heaven. The sun came out for the rest of the run, but there was quite a lot of shade due to the early time that we were out (I started running at 8:20).I got pretty tired during the last half mile. Night before last I didn't sleep very well and only had about 5 hours sleep, including two naps during the day. I did better last night and got about 6 1/2 hours sleep, but it takes several days for my body to respond to having more sleep. Seven hours is my \"normal\", so 6 1/2 isn't bad.I did take an extra bottle of water, and it was nice to have the water. On about half the walks, I took a swallow every walk instead of every other walk. Four bottles should be good up to 4 miles, and then I'll add a fifth bottle that will take me up to 5 miles. By then it will be Fall and I won't need as much water.I thought I'd comment on my running schedule. I'm currently running 3 times per week. My goal is to run Monday, Wednesday, and Saturday. If I don't run on Monday, I aim for Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday. If I don't run Monday or Tuesday, I drop to two days per week and run Wednesday and Saturday or Thursday and Saturday.When I was younger and running marathons, I ran five days per week. Four years ago when I ran the Great Salt Lake Half Marathon, I ran four days per week. I may eventually bring in another day, but it all depends on my health and how I feel."},

When I finished, the shade temperature was in the high 90s. The high today in shade temperature was 101. Along with this heat, we're having higher humidity. It rained during the night, and evaporation from that raised the humidity level.  I drank my 24 oz (3 cups) of water and was glad that I had it. I really need to get out earlier while it is still cool. Our low last night was 66.There wern't many others on the Parkway today. I saw a couple of runners and two or three groups of walkers.

When I left about 4 pm to go running, the shade temperature was 72 and a light rain, more of a mist than a rain, was falling.Because of the lower temperature, I didn't take any water with me. However, I became thirsty during the last mile of the run. I had drunk two glasses of water before I left, but I sweated a lot during the run and could have used some water. 72 (F) seems cool compared to mid 90s, but 72 is still pretty warm for running. The good news is that I didn't take or need any rest stops. I'm still doing 45 steps running and 33 steps walking (well, not really steps; the number of times my left foot hits the ground).I saw a rock check in a field (same place I've seen them in the past), and I saw a lot of Starlings (maybe Doves) on the path. At first I thought the birds were quail, but when I got close to them, I could tell they wern't quail. They were too big to be sparrows.I didn't measure my wakeup heart rate this morning, but I assume it was high. I did get a good 7 hours of sleep last night, but I need at least a week of good sleeping to bring my heart rate down to \"normal\". I'll be going to bed soon after I post this report, and I should be asleep by 11:30."},

I took small steps and made sure I used a mid-sole strike.A couple of hours later, I went for my regular run and did the 2.66 miles again. I felt fine, had a good energy level, and enjoyed the run/walk. My wakeup HR was 54. I'm still doing the 30:30 (seconds) ratio of running to walking. On the way back, I decided that since my morning excursion to the mailbox went well, I'd try it barefoot to get back to my car. I took off my shoes and socks and stood on the asphalt path. The asphalt wasn't smooth, and I realized my feet weren't used to the roughness of the path. I walked around for a minute and then decided I'd walk to the next bench. So, I carried my shoes and socks and headed down the path. After I'd walked a couple hundred yards, I realized my feet felt better, and I had high hopes of making it to the bench, a distance of about 0.4 miles. However, as I continued walking barefooted, my feet started feeling tender, and I put my shoes on and finished the distance using my normal 30:30 running and walking.When I first started the run, a few sprinkles were falling, but by the time I'd gone half a mile, the sprinkles had stopped and the sun was coming out from behind the clouds.

She told me her son hadn't run farther than a mile, but his friends were ahead of him, and he was trying to catch up with him. He apparently had asthma or something, because he uses an inhaler.

The bottom line is that I need to manage my schedule better....The temperature was in the 70s (F). The sky was partly cloudy, and it was hot. I drank one bottle of water and would have drunk the other bottle if I had continued my run. We should get rain later today or tonight.I looked for the wader at the sand bars but only saw a few ducks.Last week a friend who drives a motorized chair on the Parkway told me he had seen baby Rock Chucks in the rocks near the end of the north-bound leg of the Parkway. I saw adult Rock Chucks there last summer, but I haven't seen them this Spring. During the past week I've been looking for the babies but haven't seen them. I make more noise while running (due to the pounding of my feet) than the motorized chair, and the noise might be scaring the Rock Chucks such that they stay in their holes.I saw another red winged blackbird today. I've seen quite a few of them in past months. They are a beautiful bird -- pure black with a splotch of red and a bit of yellow on their wing. The following picture was taken from the web.

The camera only has a 2:1 zoom, and I couldn't get closeups of the birds. After I left the pond and continued my run, I saw two Canadian geese and two goslings.

A fisherman said he saw one of the black birds get a fish. As soon as the Pelicans saw the fish, they made a bee-line for the fish and tried to take it away from the bird.

As a runner, I've learned to pace myself), and I probably walked at least a mile, maybe a mile and a half, back and forth to our gardens.

I wonder what baby quail are called.Another sure sign of Spring that I've seen a lot lately is the Robins. Robins are one the first signs of Spring.The canals have water in them, about 2 weeks earlier than normal. Another sign that the water-management-people are trying to reduce the level in Utah Lake to make room for a lot of runoff water from melting snow in the mountains. As I drove past one canal,  I saw a duck in the water. The duck was a couple hundred feet away, and I couldn't tell if it was male or female.The level in the Jordan River is a couple of inches higher than it was on Monday.

Also, when I switched to Galloway's 30:30 ratio of running and walking, I felt like I was going faster that I had been going. I've been saying for years that, since we're not competitive runners, we should run at a comfortable LSD pace such that we feel fine during and after the run. I haven't been doing that; I've felt tired during and after my runs, lately.Currently, I feel fine up to about 7/8 of a mile, and then I start feeling tired. By two miles, I'm definitely tired. So, I think I will reduce my distance to two miles and continue to run a 30:30 ratio. When I reach the point where I feel fine at two miles, I'll start to increase my distance, but I'll use smaller increases than I've been doing. My increases have varied from a 25% increase to 17%, and those increases are all significantly larger than the 10% or less increases that historically I've been making.So, back to two miles and smaller and less often increases, and I'll see how things go.Just a short note to mention that I feel about the same with a 15:15 ratio as I do with a 30:30 ratio of running to walking."},

The thought then occurred to me that a 15:15 ratio might be better since I would do less running before I walked. I tried that ratio during the next two miles, although I sometimes used longer ratios and even the 30:30 ratio due to my forgetting to start running at the end of the walking cycle. I'm actually counting steps not measuring time. I do 45 steps running and 33 steps walking for the 30:30 cycle and 22 steps running and 16 steps walking for the 15:15 cycle. I'm used to walking for 33 steps, and due to that habit I would reach 16 steps and keep on walking until I remembered I hadn't stopped at 16.

The air temperature, though, was in the high 30s, and the snow hasn't collected on the sidewalks and roads. It has collected on the lawns. A light snow was falling during my run, but I was warm and felt good.I didn't check my wakeup pulse rate this morning, but I felt good before, during, and after my run. I followed Jeff Galloway's 30:30 (seconds) ratio again by counting steps. I counted steps, not to control the time of walking and running, but to check the accuracy of my guesstimates of how far I should run or walk. I would choose a tree, a big rock, a clump of grass, or a water puddle and then count steps until I got to that point. In the beginning my guesstimates were too long, but by the end of my run, my guesstimates were within a couple of steps of being the correct distance. My goal is to not measure time or count steps but to go by \"feel\" as to how far to run or to walk. I don't think it is necessary to run exactly 30 seconds or to walk 60 seconds. I just want to run a short distance and walk a shorter distance. In his blog entry about frequent but short spurts of running and walking, Galloway said that some runners are actually completing a route in less time than they did following the more traditional pattern. I checked that today by using my GPS to measure my mile splits. On February 24, for example, my mile splits were 16:42 and 18:29. I measured my splits on several days, and they were always within 20 or 30 seconds of those times. Today, however, my splits were 15:21 and 15:50. That is, my total time for 2 miles when running until my legs started feeling tired and then walking for a minute or so and then running again was 35 minutes and 11 seconds. Today, using shorter spurts for running and walking, my total time was 31 minutes and 11 seconds, and I felt much better at the end. My pace today during the first mile was a little bit faster, but the pace was significantly faster during the second mile because I started walking before my legs felt tired. If my splits were to be extrapolated to 3 miles for a 5K race, it would reduce my time for the race by about 6 minutes. That would be a significant decrease for a short race. I will continue measuring my mile splits while I experiment with Galloway's method.My legs felt fine at the end of my run, and this is the first run since January 2009 that my legs felt fine during 2.5 miles."},

During the first mile, I followed Galloway's suggested ratio of running:walking of 30:30 (seconds). However, I could tell I was getting tired, and I changed to a 30:60 ratio. That helped. I should have made that change as soon as I realized I was tired.Aside from being tired, it was a nice run on a beautiful day. The temperature was in the low 70s (F), but there was a 15 mph wind. During the first mile, I had to overcome the wind, and that probably helped me be tired. The main reason, I think, that I was tired was that I only got 5 hours sleep Saturday night. The lack of sleep was due to getting home late at night and having to get up early Sunday morning. I wore my wind breaker during the first mile, and I tied it around my waist for the remainder of the run."},
{"title": "I tried Jeff Galloway's suggestion of a new ratio in my run", "date": "Saturday, March 27, 2010", "text": "I tried today running 2.5 miles following Jeff  Galloway's suggestion of using a 30:30 (seconds) cycle of running and  walking. I ran for 45 steps with my left foot and walked for 33 steps.  Later, as I started to get tired, I still ran for 45 steps and walked  slower for 30 steps. To make it easier to monitor the time, I started  when the \"second\" digits were 0 and changed to walking when the digits  were 30. Sometimes I would run or walk a little bit more than I had  planned, and I would compensate by decreasing the number of steps  walking. Although, towards the end I was getting tired, and I  compensated by decreasing the number of steps running.  I'm hoping that after doing this a number of times, it will become  automatic and I'll be able to \"feel\" that it is time to change. The  number 30 likely isn't a magic number, and if one does short spurts of  running and walking, the benefits will probably accrue.Did I go  faster? I don't know since I didn't have my Garmin with me, but it did  feel like I was going faster. My body-energy was spread over the whole  run, and that contributes to a faster speed. I noticed that the limiting  factor was my body rather than my legs. It's been a number of months  since my body limited my running. Due to a busy schedule today, I only  had a dish of Corn Checks and a banana for breakfast at 8:30 am and no lunch or  snacks. I grabbed a handful of Corn Checks before I left for running  about 3 pm, and I ate an energy bar while driving to the Jordan River.  So, my lack of good food may have been why my body was the limiting  factor. My legs felt pretty good, thanks to the short spurts of running  instead of running until my legs got tired.All of this reminds  me of my time as a Boy Scout. On of the requirements was to run the  \"scout mile\" in 12 minutes. The scout mile consisted of alternating 100  steps of running and 100 steps of walking. The scout mile was not far  off from what I did today."},
{"title": "Going to change my walking breaks during my runs", "date": "Thursday, March 25, 2010", "text": "I read something yesterday in Jeff Galloway's blog that caught my attention. He advocates taking more frequent but short walking breaks. Specifically, doing 30 seconds of running and 30 seconds of walking for the whole run. The purpose, I think, is to take frequent but short walking breaks to prevent fatigue, thus keeping ones energy level high. I've been running for about 1/4 mile at the beginning of my run, and then, as my run progresses, running shorter segments with walks in between. My signal that I should stop running and walk for a couple hundred feet is that my legs feel tired. As my run progresses, my spurts of running get shorter, until at the end I'm only running about 50 feet before I stop to walk.I'm going to try Jeff's suggestion during my run on Saturday. By taking walking breaks more often, my spurts of running will be shorter, and (hopefully) my legs won't get as tired."},

A beautiful, sunny day. I wore my wind breaker over my short sleeved T-shirt, but I took it off and tied it around my waist during my return to my car.The Jordan River is over 2 feet lower than it was on Monday. In fact, it looks like it is returning to its low level in the winter. This means the pumping station at the beginning of the river at the north end of Utah Lake has stopped pumping large quantities of water into the river. I've been speculating that the persons who manage the pumping station were trying to lower the level in the lake to prepare for the spring runoff of snow melt. Apparently the level is now low enough that the lake can handle the snow melt. The level in the river should go up again in April and May."},

Last week we had the same temperature range, and the afternoons were pleasant, and I thought today would be the same. I parked my car and got out to run, and I realized there was a 15 mph cold wind blowing (another storm front has reached the Salt Lake valley). I was cold during my whole run. I ran about half the time, and my body and legs felt fine but my arms were cold. A long sleeved, heaver T-shirt would have been about right, or my wind breaker as a second layer). My splits during the first mile were 16+ minutes and 17+ minutes during the second mile. Those times include both running and walking.The Jordan River is several inches higher. There is a certain flat rock that I use to gauge the height of the water. In the past, the water level has been even with the top of that rock, but today I couldn't see the rock because it was covered with water. We had rain last night, and the pumping station is putting more water into the river to keep Utah Lake from flooding."},

Well, I did stop once on the way our for 15 seconds to look at the river to see if it was higher (I didn't need the rest and could have kept on running), and a second time at the turn around point; the path is too narrow to conveniently turn around without stopping. I stopped and walked 180 degrees (about 5 seconds) and then started running again, not stopping until I was finished.Fourteen months ago, January 2009, I finished a 20 mile week with a 7-mile run on Saturday. On Monday I could only walk 100 feet. After 5 days in the hospital (blood clots) I was up to 400 feet in my walking. After I left the hospital, my wife and I walked every other day or so, and I got up to a mile and a half. At that point I started mixing in some running. I could tell during the late spring and summer that my body seemed stronger, but I couldn't run more that two or three hundred feet before I had to walk. I increased my mixture of walking and running to a distance of 4 miles. The amount of running compared to walking continued to increase, but I still had to stop and walk after running a bit.When I left home this morning, I never dreamed I would make it the whole distance without walking. I am a firm believer in walking breaks in my longer runs but not in my shorter runs. In the past I wouldn't take walking breaks in runs up to five miles, but I would take them for runs longer than 5 miles. I expect that as I get older, I will take walking breaks in shorter runs.My wakeup heart rate was 61, higher than I had expected (I have only been getting about 6-6 1/2 hours sleep each night during the past week). The temperature was 36 (F) when I left and 35 when I returned. Snow flurries were falling during my run. During the late morning we had heavy snow for half an hour, and I left for my run after the snow returned to just flurries.The Jordan River looks to be two or three inches higher (5-7 cm) than it has been. It must have close to 10 times the water than it had during the winter. We haven't had our spring thaw yet, and when that happens a lot of water from the snow-melt in the mountains will come down into Utah Lake and the river. I won't be surprised if we have flooding in low places."},

Now, I wear long pants until the temperature gets into 40s and during the late fall, winter, and early spring into the 50s. I'm also running slower than I used to, and my body doesn't generate as much heat at that slow speed."},

During most of that time I was waiting for the lab to inspect the layers that were removed (I read an entire issue of a Farm and Country magazine). Only two layers were removed. After the first layer was removed, they could see the roots of the cancer entwined around a nerve. The second layer removed the roots of the cancer and the nerve. The stitches used to close the incision will be absorbed by my body, and I don't have to do any maintenance to keep the incision clean. So far, I haven't felt any pain because of the local used during the surgery, but I may feel some pain in a few hours. The bad news is that I can't run for a week, but I can walk. No heavy lifting for a week, no running, nothing that would increase my blood pressure and thus the chances for bleeding."},

I wore two layers, a regular technical T-shirt and my wind breaker, and my running shorts. I was actually sweating on my face when I finished the run.During my first mile, I ran about 2/3 of the mile and walked 1/3. The great thing was that instead of doing less running during the second mile and even less during the third and even less during the fourth miles, I continued to run about 2/3 of each mile. That means I ran about 2 2/3 miles of the 4 miles. That is the most running I've done in one run during the past year. For breakfast I had two glasses of a fruit drink that my wife made. She had one glass. All together, the drink had an apple, a banana, fresh grapes, frozen blueberries, and orange juice. It tasted great. For lunch, about 2:30 pm, I had a slice of a Costco Pepperoni pizza and an ice cream bar with nuts. I knew I couldn't run on that much food, so I waited three hours and then went running. My stomach was fine during the run, and I felt good. The pizza had a lot of calories, but that was my main meal for the day. For supper I had a few nuts.Tomorrow at 11 am I will have surgery for a Basel Cell skin cancer on my forhead. The surgery is the Mhos surgery, in which the skin cancer is removed in layers and each layer is inspected under a microscope. Layers are taken until the inspection shows no trace of the cancer. Depending on how many layers are needed tomorrow, the surgery could last from 1-4 or more hours. Most of the time is waiting while the inspection is performed, and the surgery isn't very stressful. About four years ago, I had 10 skin cancers removed this way, over a six-month period.I may not run for a few days, depending on how my energy level holds up."},

It's not a problem when I'm standing or sitting upright, but it is a problem if I lie down within 2-3 hours after I eat. I take a bunch of pills in the morning and at night. Except for Warfarin, taken to reduce my risk of blood clots, the pills are natural stuff for nutrition, cholesterol control, and vein health. I usually take the pills after I eat, so the 2-3 hours that I mentioned above is the period after taking the pills. I often forget to take the pills soon after I eat supper and end up taking them around 9 or 10 pm. That means that I'm up until midnight or 1 or 2 am.

In recent weeks my weight has been 10-15 pounds above my weight 13 months ago before blood clots attacked me. I peaked at 38 pounds of extra weight 12 months ago. Today my weight came in at 8 pounds above my pre-clot weight, and I think much if not most of that weight is probably due to fat gain. I say this because my leg-measurements indicate my legs are currently close to the normal size, indicating most of the swelling has gone. I've thought of two reasons I've gained fat weight. First, I've been eating as though I was running 20-30 miles per week, when in reality I've been running about 6-12 miles per week. Second, I've had a habit of eating later in the evening. So, I'm not eating as much, and I'm trying to eat my supper around 6-7 pm. Hopefully, my weight will continue to drop."},

My body felt OK (three layers), but my face was cold when I was running into the wind.My mile splits for the first two miles were 16:42 and 18:29, about the same as yesterday. To give a context to those numbers, I checked my running and walking paces, and they were about 15 and 22, respectfully. This means that during the first mile, I did more running than walking, and during the second mile, I did about the same. That is what I had guessed, based on rough estimates of how far I went during each cycle of running and walking.My walking pace shows I'm not walking very fast. This is, I think, due to my fast cadence pace of about 180 steps per minute. That fast cadence pace means that I'm taking relatively small steps when I run (good idea to avoid overstriding), and I think my walking has also adopted smaller steps. When I run and when I walk I'm using a mid-strike due to the smaller steps. I'm naturally a heel striker and have evolved into midfoot strikes.I had minor surgery Monday afternoon to obtain tissue for a biopsy for skin cancer.

The water is about one foot below the tops of the rocks, and I think the water will soon cover the rocks. The big shovel that I thought would be picked up yesterday was still there, but a semi tractor pulling a flat-bed trailer pulled up to get the shovel. The semi had 22 wheels instead of the \"normal\" 18 wheels.The tunnel under 106th South is covered with water that has drained from the dirt above the tunnel and has entered the tunnel via several water pipes along the west wall of the tunnel. An electric pump is removing water from the tunnel, but the pump isn't keeping up with the incoming water, and the water is deeper than it was yesterday.The water in the tunnel is about 3 inches deep, and I waded through it. My socks are synthetic (technical socks??), and they didn't absorb water. When I left the tunnel, the water was drained from my socks and shoes, and I couldn't tell the socks and shoes were wet. When I got home, I took my shoes and socks off so my feet could dry and get warm. The water was cold.This video of the water was taken yesterday. If you look carefully at the bottom of the wall at the right of the tunnel, you can see the ports that bring water into the tunnel. The pump that is removing water from the tunnel is submerged at the left side of the tunnel, not too far from the beginning of the water as shown in the video. Most runners walk on the concrete wall that separates the tunnel from the river, but I don't have good balance and either wade through the water or take a short detour to a traffic semaphore. If I were to walk on the wall, I would need a long stick to act as a third leg.I received an email telling me that this blog has been added to the top 50 blogs listed by The Nurse Nut site.

They came to Utah to ski in the Ski for Light event that my wife and I observed on Saturday. They were scheduled to leave on Sunday, but their flights were canceled due to heavy snow back east. Their flights were rescheduled for Tuesday, but those flights were canceled due to the snow. They are currently scheduled to leave on Friday and Saturday. There were actually three friends, but one of them did get away on Tuesday, although he was stranded in Minneapolis and won't leave there until Friday. Fortunately, one of his friends from Ski for Light lives in the Minneapolis area, and he is staying with them until he gets a flight to Dulles Airport in Virginia. My friend who is stranded in Minneapolis is blind and has a dog. His wife, who is staying with me and will, hopefully, leave on Saturday is blind but doesn't have a dog. The friend who walked with me today isn't blind and was the guide (companion) during the Ski for Light for my friend who is in Minneapolis. The friend who lives in Minneapolis isn't blind and was the guide for the wife who is staying with me.Last week there was a construction-ribbon blocking the path were I run. Actually, the ribbon was blocking the south-bound path but not the north-bound path, and I ran the north-bound path. I didn't know what construction was going on further south, but since I was going north, I didn't worry about it.Yesterday, after I completed the 1.5 mile round-trip on the northern path, I went south to the tunnel under 106th South, and I saw where the construction had taken place. Weeds and bushes had been cleared from about 20 feet of the river bank, and I could see equipment-tracks in the dirt. I saw large concrete blocks (about 10 feet long and 2 feet on a side) being lifted into a big truck, and I wondered what the blocks were for and where they came from.Today, as my friend and I walked past the place where the blocks were at yesterday, I got answers to my questions. I talked with a man who was preparing to move a large shovel onto his flat-bed trailer being pulled by his truck. The blocks were gone. He said they were placing rocks on the river bank to prevent erosion, and the blocks were used to create a diversion so the water wouldn't flow near the bank. They had to stop their work due to the faster water-flow in the river, and they were moving the blocks and their equipment to another location for another job. The placement of the rocks and the higher level of water in the river indicate that a large runoff from the mountains is expected this spring."},

The higher water is still in the river. I would estimate that the water-level has risen about 2 feet, based on some dead branches that are in the water. These are the branches that the Heron was standing by when I took a picture of the Heron several months ago. The water-flow in the river is controlled by a pumping station at the place in Utah Lake where water flows into the Jordan River. It's too early for the Spring runoff of water from the mountains. My guess is that the decision makers want to lower the water in the lake to make room for more water when the runoff begins in a couple of months."},

I ran more and walked less than I've been doing. I think this was my best run since my blood-clot attack in January 2009. I wasn't tired at the end and felt fine during the rest of the afternoon and the evening. My wakeup heart rate has been in the low 60s, higher than I'd like, but it will come down in the next couple of weeks.I haven't run for the past two weeks, because my wife and I drove 2000 miles to visit St. George, Utah, Zion National Park, Las Vegas, and Phoenix.

{"title": "My plan for the future", "date": "Wednesday, January 27, 2010", "text": "I mentioned in my previous post, that I was reminded by a doctor that my performance will have dropped off due to my reduced running during the past year. That is something I hadn't considered, and it makes a lot of sense to me. I was attributing my reduced performance to the blood clots I had in January. That may have been true during the Spring and early Summer of last year, but it may not be true for my reduced performance since then. I'm finally realizing that I haven't been running many miles per week, and I need to consider myself a beginner and go from there. If I follow the accepted training rules of running (10% rule, heavy/light) and recognize that I am getting old, I should be able to bring my performance back up. How much my performance will improve, time will tell.So my plan for the coming year is to be a beginner who can  run and walk 2 miles, and I will do my training from that viewpoint. I've been telling a lot of runners how to get started in running, and now I will be a true-life test-case to see if my ideas really do work. I'm enthused about this new viewpoint on my running! Because of my age, I will only increase distance twice a month at most, and if I don't feel ready for an increase, I'll go for one increase that month or even no increases for that month. The most important thing is that I remain free of injury and that I enjoy my running and walking."},
{"title": "Update on my physical condition", "date": "Tuesday, January 26, 2010", "text": "I thought I'd bring everyone up to date on my physical condition. Those who are following this blog know that one year ago I was attacked by blood clots that brought my running to an abrupt halt. On Saturday I finished a 20+ mile week with a 7-mile run, and two days later I could only walk about 100 feet.  My performance since then has slowly improved, but I've been concerned about reasons why my performance hasn't improved at a faster rate. Last Fall I worked up to a distance of 4 miles by alternating walking and running.  I've cut the distance back to 2 miles to give myself more time to adjust to the increases in distance. I'm currently doing 2-mile of alternating running and walking.Five and a half years ago I was in a serious automobile accident and spent three weeks in the ICU. During that time a filter was placed in my vein to catch blood clots from my legs. The filter did work and caught a lot of clots. When I was released from the ICU and went to a different hospital for therapy, the filter was left in my vein because the walls of the vein were becoming embedded with the filter, and the doctor said removing the filter would be a \"messy\" job.I began to believe that the filter was restricting my blood-flow and thus my performance. I discussed this with my doctor and was referred to a blood-clot specialist for consultation about this. The specialist suggested that I have a CT scan of my legs so they could get a good view of my veins, the filter, and associated things. The CT scan gave the following findings.There is an infrarenal IVC filter in place. Subtle material of decreased attenuation is noted throughout the course of the left and common iliac vein which is concerning for thrombus. There is contrast on both sides of this possible thrombus which suggests it is chronic in nature. There is normal opacification of the remaining visualized lower extremity veins without evidence of a filling defect to suggest a thrombus. Atherosclerotic calcification of the lower extremity arteries is noted. There is prominence of the pelvic and scrotal vasculature which is compatible with varicoceles.A doctor who specializes in veins reviewed the CT images and concluded that (a) the filter couldn't be removed, (b) my body had been robust in creating collateral veins around the filter, and (c), I have a restriction in the blood flow in my left leg. The blood-clot specialist reviewed this with me and encouraged me to continue running or walking robustly. He also reminded me that it has been a year since I did distance running, and my performance has dropped significantly during that time, just due to my reduced running during the past year."},

When I went outside to shovel my driveway and sidewalks, I wore my ice shoes, and they worked fine. The screw-heads dug into the snow and ice, and I didn't slip at all. I tried to slide my foot back and forth on a patch of ice, but the screw-heads dug into the ice and didn't move. The same thing happened with the commercial ice crampons that I used the past two winters. The cost of the screws ($1.98) and a few minutes of time are much less than the cost of the crampons. In fact, the screws should work better than the crampons in deeper, heaver snow, because they won't come out of the soles (the crampons came off in the snow). After I finished with my driveway and sidewalks, I jogged about a quarter mile in the street where ice had built up from the pressure of vehicular tires. I'm calling this Phase 1 of my testing of the ice shoes. Phase 2 will be when I run with them on ice and snow on the Jordan River Parkway.I put 7 screws in each shoe (LOCO Perfecto), three in the heel, three in the mid sole, and one in the toe. I used 6-32 hex head one-inch screws in the heel and mid sole, and a 4-40 hex head 3/4 inch screw in the toe. I used those particular lengths of screws so the point of the screw would be about half-way through the sole. I used a nut-driver for the 6-32 screws and a screw driver for the 4-40 screw, and the installation only took a few minutes. Most of the time was with the two 4-40 screws; I had to drill a small hole to help each screw get started. I used a screw driver because I couldn't find my nut driver for those screws.I'm keeping the ice shoes in the trunk of my car so I'll have them if I discover ice on the Parkway path when I start running."},

{"title": "A possible reason for my slow recovery since my blood clot attack in January", "date": "Tuesday, December 01, 2009", "text": "I received an interesting email from a pulmonary critical care physician (who is also a marathoner) who recently discovered this blog and has been reading about my recovery from my auto accident five years ago and from my blood clots in January. He hasn't seen my medical records or the x-ray of the vein filter that was put in my body five years ago and is still there. His only source of information is this blog. Thus, his remarks are speculation and concern the pattern of my recovery. Here are his remarks.Ponder this hypothetical,A person sustained multiple trauma in an automobile accident.  Injuries included mild brain injury and other.  At some point a deep vein thombosis is recognized and rather than immediately begin anticoagulation (i.e. because of recent trauma), an inferior vena cava (IVC) umbrella filter is placed to prevent pulmonary emboli.  Later, possibly anticoagulation is given for six months or so and discontinued.A few years later unknown to the patient, and forgotten by his medical providers the IVC filter slowly clots off.  When the filter finally clots off and hence the IVC blood flow halts a sudden lower extremity venous pressure develops, with new leg clots developing.  The patient also develops shortness of breath because of reduced venous return to the circulation.  Quite significant bilateral lower extremity edema develops due to IVC flow interruption.  In fact the edema and entire course are way out of proportion for simple lower extremity DVT but are the hallmark of IVC interruption. Eventually, collateral veins develop to take on the lower torso blood return.  But, the venous return is never what it was and exercise capacity remains reduced.  Also, leg edema remains an issue and compression stalkings from time to time are required.What is missing is imaging of the IVC to determine the presence or absence of occlusion of IVC and hence blood flow.Story over,The above hypothetical is not to be construed as medical advice, but is a story not dissimilar from what the blog would lead an imaginative person to consider. Even though I'm not a medical person, his remarks make a lot of sense to me. The week before the blood clots, I ran about 20 miles, ending with a 7-miler on Saturday. I felt great during that week. On Monday I started my run, and after about 1/4 mile, I got a cramp in what I thought was my hams. I stopped three times to stretch it out, but the cramp came back as soon as I started running. I went home and took a two-hour nap. When I got up, I could only walk about 100 feet before I was so tired I had to sit down. If I climbed the stairs to my bedroom, I was sweating profusely and was out of breath. At first I thought the problem was that I had been pushing too hard in my running, but when the symptoms got worse, I checked myself into the hospital (my wife and son who lives a few miles away were in Florida).  A CAT scan of my body showed clots in both legs but none in my lungs, although the hospital doctor was suspicious that I might have had small clots in my lungs since I was out of breath when doing minor exertion. During my 5 days in the hospital, I managed to get my walking up to 400 feet. What ever \"hit\" me certainly came on very quickly. Now, after 10 months, I can only run about 1/3 mile before I have to walk, and each leg of running gets shorter during the 4 miles that I'm currently doing. During the Spring and Summer I could only run about 1/10 mile before I  had to walk. The 1/3 mile that I can run now is a big improvement. Mention in the email of brain damage was interesting to me, because I didn't have any injury to my head from the automobile accident. Brain damage must be a side effect of bad blood circulation in my legs. I'll be discussing this with my doctor and will ask that the specialists in the Intermountain Health Care system review my case to determine if anything can be done to correct what may have been a mistake when they left the filter in my body. I had been in the ICU for three weeks with the filter, and the x-ray of the filter that was taken just before I left the ICU and went to another hospital for therapy showed that the filter was full of clots. On the x-ray, the filter showed up as a solid black rectangle. I was told at that time that they didn't want to remove the filter, because the walls of the vein had started to grow around the filter. I'm glad the filter was installed because it did catch a lot of clots, but in retrospect I wonder if it should have been removed even though it likely would have been \"messy\" surgery."},

{"title": "Ran 4 miles again on a beautiful day", "date": "Wednesday, November 25, 2009", "text": "I started my run this morning about 11 am. The temperature was in the high 30s (F), no wind, and lots of sunshine. My wakeup heart rate was 56 this morning, and I felt great. I could tell that with each mile I was getting more tired, but that is to be expected. During the last mile, I was walking and running about the same amounts. This was the same as in past runs.During my 3rd mile, I measured my stride rate as 89x2 or 178. That is the same as it was before I was attacked by blood clots, and that is a good sign. It indicates that with my body being weak from blood clots, my natural running rhythm hasn't been affected. I just naturally have a fast stride rate. Having a fast stride rate is good, because it forces one to take smaller steps, thus avoiding over striding. A runner's foot should strike the ground under his body instead of in front of the body. Having your feet touch the ground in front of your body means you're over striding, and that a higher stress on your legs and actually slows you down. Your foot sticking out in front of your body acts as a break until your body passes over your foot.World class runners all run with a stride rate of about 180. This means they are faster because they take larger steps, not because they take steps more often. So, my question is, how do they take larger steps without over striding? I don't know. There are moments in their stride-cycle when both feet are off the ground, that is, they are coasting through the air. Maybe they coast further than we do.Right now, a wakeup heart rate of 56 is a low value. Before my bout with blood clots, my normal WHR was 50, and 56 would have been high. Hopefully, if a few more months I'll be back to 50 as my normal value."},
{"title": "How I keep motivated to run", "date": "Tuesday, November 24, 2009", "text": "Since today is a rest day and I'm not running, I thought I'd discuss how I keep my motivation to run. One of the runners in the running.about.com forum asked how I keep myself motivated, and I gave the following answer.Having goals helps one to be motivated, whether in running or in other activities. I don't do a lot of racing, so my  goals are mostly in other aspects of running. Racing goals wouldn't be achieved for several months, and I need goals for each run. So, I focus on short-term  goals, things I can accomplish this week or next week. For example, a  year ago South Jordan, Utah started construction on a new leg of the  Jordan River Parkway where I run. It is a 0.75 mile leg that goes north  to the border of West Jordan City. I've mentioned that leg quite a few times in this blog. I enjoyed watching the construction of the path  and talking with the guys doing the work. That gave me goals for about  four months. I looked forward to watching them carve a new path, compact  the dirt, lay down plastic on the dirt, and finally lay about 6 inches  of asphalt on the plastic. I was interested to learn from one of the  workers that they sprayed weed killer on the dirt before they laid the  plastic. He said weeds will come up through the plastic and the asphalt if they don't spray the ground.  After they finished with the asphalt, I enjoyed watching them put in a  wire fence along portions of the path that had horses.After the construction workers  left, I learned that the wire fence would be replaced, because it wasn't  strong enough to keep the horses from getting on the path. So, I  enjoyed watching a different guy put in a better fence. I was  particularly interested in how he could put the fence posts in cement in  the middle of the winter. It was interesting to learn that he had a  machine that held a roll of chain link fencing and placed the fencing  along the path. Many years ago, I had a part-time job one summer moving  rolls of chain link fencing from box cars to storage in a building, and I  know how heavy those rolls of fencing can be (200 - 300 pounds). I thought it interesting  that the second guy put his fencing in places where the other fencing  wasn't put. Then I began to wonder about the taxpayers of South Jordan  City. Did they end up paying twice for the fencing, or did the first  company lose money because their fencing wasn't good enough. Did their  contract with the city specify exactly the type of fence to be  installed, or was it left to the judgment of the contractor. Did the  city talk with the land owners before the city purchased the land for  the path to find out what kind of fence was needed?For the past couple of years, someone has been moving dirt in one of the fields bordering the new leg of the Jordan River Parkway. I could hear the heavy equipment being used to move the dirt, but I couldn't see that any progress was being made. Finally, this fall I could see that progress was being made. I had the chance to talk with the land owner a couple of weeks ago, and he said he is preparing the land for the construction of a subdivision of new houses. Lately he has been moving big rocks to make a rock wall along the border of the Jordan River Parkway. At first I thought he was building a rock wall for landscaping, but I noticed yesterday that he is filling in dirt up to the top of the wall. Since his land is in the flood plain of the river, I realized he is raising the level of his land about three feet and is using the rock wall to prevent the dirt from being washed away during a flood. People who live in his houses won't see the rock wall, but I see the wall as I run past it, and it looks nice.This fall I  saw a big Heron in the Jordan River. It just stood there and didn't move  much. I saw it on quite a few different days. That was interesting  because I had never seen a Heron before. I haven't seen it lately, and I  wonder if it went south for the winter. I also wonder how it could  stand for long periods of time in the cold water. Ducks have soft feathers (down) that  helps insulate them when they swim, but the Heron just has bare legs.  Most of the birds in the river are ducks, but this fall I've seen quite a few  American Coots. The most popular posts in this  blog are about black ducks that I've seen. Some of them are Coots, but  some are different. Quite a few people have found my posts via Google  and have commented that they, too, have seen mysterious black ducks.A  year ago, I saw a black and white rabbit near the river. Someone had  apparently turned the rabbit lose. I enjoyed seeing the rabbit a  few times, but I haven't seen it this year. So, I wonder what happened  to it. Maybe a fox got it; I have seen a red fox on the path a few times. If you click on the wildlife label in this blog, you can read about the birds and animals that I've seen during the six years I've kept the  blog. In fact, the blog itself has helped me get out running, since I've  gone public with my running and have to \"keep up my public image\" so to  speak.I have a lot of short-term goals related to my running. I  began 2009 running about 20-22 miles per week, including a long run of  10 miles and a medium run of 7 miles and a rest run of 5 miles. Then in  mid January I was attacked by blood clots. I went from a 7 mile run on a  Saturday to only being able to walk 100 feet on Monday. My progress in  getting back to my former distance has taken a lot more time than I  expected. It has been almost 10 months, and my weekly distance is only  up to about 10 miles, including my longest run, so far, of 4 miles. So,  I'm busy with my weekly goals in inching forward in distance. There is a  local 5K race in June that I've run twice (a 2nd and then a 1st in my  age group). I missed it in 2009 because of the blood clots. I wonder if  I'll be able to run it in 2010. I should be able to do the distance OK,  but I may not be very fast. But that's OK. When you get to be my age,  you're less concerned about speed and are happy to \"just do it\".One of the things I'm  looking forward to in the next month is putting sheet metal screws in  my running shoes to keep me from slipping on ice. My shoes have 300  miles on them and have limited life left, so they are good candidates to  become \"ice shoes\". Last winter and the winter before I used a  commercial product with steel spikes, but they kept coming off when I got  into snow several inches deep. People who have used sheet metal screws  say they work fine, and I thought I'd give them a try.The  final reason that I get out and run is because I enjoy it. This   enjoyment has carried me through 38 years of running. There are times   when I get busy with other things and don't get out and run, but that's   OK. I'm like everyone else and have my ups and downs. I don't beat  myself up with guilt for not going out. I just finish my project at home   that kept me from running for a day or two and then put my running  shoes  back on and head down to the Jordan River. We are all different. What motivates one person to run may not help another person. One of the key things is to recognize that you're not \"perfect\" and to not feel guilty when you don't get out and run. Don't feel guilty because you're slow or because you don't go very far or because you don't go as fast as you did when you were younger. Just accept who you are and enjoy your life. If you would like to leave a comment explaining how you keep motivated to run, I (and others) would enjoy listening to you."},
{"title": "Did a nice 3-miler to finish my rest week", "date": "Monday, November 23, 2009", "text": "My wakeup heart was 55, and I felt fine and was anxious to get out running. However, we had 3 inches of snow last night, so I delayed my run until noon to give the sun time to melt the snow on the Parkway path. The shade temperature was in the high 30s (F) during my run, but the direct-sun temperature was in the high 50s. Most of the path is in the direct sun. There were a few shady spots that had some snow and ice. The air felt cold, though. I only wore two layers, and I was cold when I began but felt fine after a quarter mile. I'm wearing cotton compression socks that go up to my thigh (I'll be wearing them for another 13 months), and they kept my legs warm.During the first half of the northbound out-back segment of the path, I only took one relatively short walking break during the 0.75 miles out and three short walking breaks on the way back. That was a good improvement from the summer when I was taking 4 breaks out and 4 or 5 breaks back. During the last 1.5 miles, I took about the same number of breaks that I did earlier this fall when I was running 3 miles. My body is taking a lot longer in recovery from the blood clots than I had expected. I guess blood clots really do a \"job\" on ones body.I plan on doing 4 miles per run for the next two or three weeks to give my body more time to adjust to the increased distance. Then, I'll advance my three runs up to 5 miles and do that for a couple of weeks."},

If I feel fine on Monday, I'll do a 3-mile rest run, followed by (hopefully) a regular 4-mile run on Wednesday. I'm capping my runs at 4 miles for a couple of weeks to give my body more time to adjust  to that distance.On Friday a week ago, when I went from 3.3 miles to 3.88 miles, I had a 13.5% increase in distance. Then, on Monday, I added a bit more to give a 4 mile run. All of this put a heavy stress on my body, and that stress was reflected in my increase in wakeup heart rate as well as an overall feeling of being tired. My rest this week, that began on Tuesday, has brought my wakeup heart rate down to 57, and I feel fine. Today was a great run, and I'll hopefully end my rest week with a 3 mile rest-run on Monday. A common problem with many runners is that they don't give their bodies enough rest, and then they wonder why they have gotten injured. Running heavy/light and taking rest weeks once a month help our bodies to recover.The temperature during my run this morning was in the mid 40s (F), the sky was cloudy, and snow showers are forecast for this evening and tomorrow."},

I made the change because I knew it would be dark and I wouldn't be able to see my GPS. By going south and running 4 miles, my turn-around point would be a small bridge that I could recognize in the dark.I didn't have quite the energy that I had last Friday, but I still had a good run during most of the run. During the last mile, I was getting tired, and I walked more than I had been walking during the first three miles, although the amount of walking during the last mile was about the same as it was during the summer.It was nice to run in the dark and see the lights of buildings and cars. There were a lot of ducks bedding down for the night in the river, and they were quacking. Flocks of geese flew overhead just as it was getting dark, and they were honking. My wife, though, doesn't like me to run after dark because of her concerns for my safety. So, I need to finish my run before it gets dark. I did see two cyclists and three or four runners/walkers on the path after dark."},

Today's run was much better than the run on Monday and the runs last week.It is 0.75 miles north to the turnaround, and I've been stopping and walking 2-4 times during that distance. Today I only stopped once on the way out and once on the way back. On the way back, I stopped to talk with the land owner who has been operating heavy equipment for the past two years on his land next to the Parkway path. I've been curious to know what he is planning, and he said it was new homes. Tonight, he had a big shovel moving big rocks next to the chain-link fence to be a rock wall. The part of the wall that he has finished looks nice. Having lived in Massachusetts for 17 years where rock walls are everywhere, I love rock walls.The temperature was 38 (F) when I left home and 33 (F) when I returned. I only had two layers on (T-shirt and my nylon wind breaker), but once I started running and got warmed up, I was fine. I think I will, though, switch to a long sleeved T-shirt.

I've seen the fox once or twice before. This picture of a fox is from the web. As with all the pictures in this blog, click for a larger view.After talking with the land owner for a couple of minutes, I continued my run and saw two big mule deer on the path. A minute later I saw them wading to the other side of the river. They were about 100 feet from me, and I had a good view of them. No antlers. They are big and looked as big as a young horse. This picture of a mule deer is also from the web.This is the fourth time I've seen deer during my runs. In two of the times, the deer were in the river. In one of the times, the deer was on the path, and one time the deer was a couple of hundred feet west of the path, near a house. My mother-in-law lives on the East bench of Salt Lake City, and she sees deer in her backyard every winter. Sometimes 15 or 20 deer at a time. They come off the mountain during the winter looking for food."},

I did my planned distance, but I did a lot of walking during the last part of the distance.I normally eat a few handfuls of dry cereal before I run, and they are fine because they are easily digested. Apparently peanut butter isn't easily digested. In addition, peanut butter has a lot of protein, and it isn't a good idea to eat protein during a run (save the protein for the first half hour after you finish).

Instead of a 1:1 ratio of running to walking, the ratio was probably 1.5:1 or so, meaning I ran about 1.3 miles and walked about .9 miles.The shade temperature was in the high 60s (F), the sky was blue with no clouds, and there was quite a lot of shade from the Russian Olive trees that border the river. A wonderful day!A question that a lot of runners ask when they get tired is if the legs or the body limits the distance one can do. The answer, of course, is both; it depends on the circumstances, and different people will have different answers to the question.Since my blood clots in January, my legs have been the limiting factor. I've been combining running and walking, and I usually run until my legs start to show the stress, and then I walk for a break. Today, however, my body was the limiting factor. My legs felt great while I ran, and I stopped to walk when my body told me it needed some rest. My legs didn't feel tired at all during the whole distance. This is a really good sign!"},

My wakeup heart rate was 53, I had lots of sleep over the weekend and I felt great. I was out relatively early while the temperature was still in the low 70s (F). I did 2.2 miles, about half running and half walking. The sky was sunny with fluffy clouds. We are, though, expecting thunder showers this afternoon and tomorrow.There is a 5K steeplechase run that I'd like to do at the end of the month. No timing, no medals, just a fun run. I'll have to see how my running goes between now and then. Most of the people I know who will be in the run are walkers, so my combination of running and walking won't be too noticeable.I had my usual \"feast\" of three apples from the old tree near the path. The three apples are small and probably amount to one \"normal\" sized apple.Later: We did have a thunder storm this afternoon. The sky was dark, lots of thunder and lightning, some rain, and some wind. I was glad I ran earlier in the morning. I enjoy being in a summer rain, but I don't run during thunder storms. Lightning is something I stay away from. If I am in a run and I see lightning, I count seconds until I hear the thunder from that lightning. If the time is 5 seconds or less, I head for a shelter. That 5 seconds means the lightning was only a mile away, and lightning can easily move a mile for the next strike."},

In the afternoon, my wife and I spent a couple of hours walking in the hot sun looking at exhibits at a Conservation show.

The horizontal pipes for this only have to be down about 10 feet to be in the zone of the ground that is at a constant temperature of, if I remember the temperature, 51 degrees (F). Or, they can drill a well about 150 feet deep and put pipes in there instead of in horizontal trenches."},

Each month on the first Sunday, Mormons fast two meals and contribute the equivalent cost (or more) to their local Bishop (Pastor) for use in helping persons in need. The result is that I only had one meal, yesterday evening. I frequently have less energy after fasting.

My \"bible\" for injuries is The Runner's Repair Manual\" by Dr. Murray Weisenfeld. The book says the following about hip pain.Side of hip pain is an overuse injury. It's an inflammation of the fascia, a fibrous, somewhat flexible material that's found in the hips, legs and many other places in the body. The inflammation may start with the tendons that attach the muscles to the bones; then the inflammation spreads to the fascia.I've been doing stretches to strengthen my hips, knees, and lower back, so I'm assuming the inflammation came from some other cause. For the past few days I've been taking internally 100 mg of Calendula twice a day. About 24 hours after I started the Calendula, my pain subsided. I mowed my lawns yesterday with no pain, and I ran/walked the two miles today with no pain. I did feel some pain last night due to my wife and I dancing at a wedding reception in the evening. I'm keeping my fingers crossed that I won't have more pain .... Calendula is a pretty yellow flower that acts as a mild antiseptic.My run/walk went well. The temperature was in the high 70s in the shade with sun and clouds. A great day to be out.There is an old apple tree near the Jordan River Parkway path. The tree looks pretty old because it hasn't been pruned in who knows how long. The apples on it are small, and many have worm holes. Some, however, are without worms, and they are near being ripe. I picked and ate 3 of them as I ran the path. They were good!"},

I put Arnica cream on it in the evening to help me begin the healing process. I don't know what caused the pain. I hadn't run for four days, and I felt fine during that time. I don't think running caused the pain -- if it did, there was a four-day delay before the pain set in.I felt fine during the night and for two or three hours this morning, so I went out running. However, after a quarter mile I felt the pain a bit, and I turned around and walked/jogged back to my car. I felt the pain on and off during the day. I put Arnica on every three or four hours. In the beginning, the pain was in the front of my body, about where my leg connects to my pelvis. By night, however, the pain had moved to the rear of my hip, and I began to wonder if it was a problem in my buttock. I began doing my exercise for the buttock.

Most of the ducks are gone, but I still see a few in the river and a few who are hanging around waiting for food from people.I saw the Heron again on a dead tree in the Jordan River.

However, after about a third of a mile, I knew I was too tired to run much, and I reduced the run to a 1-mile rest run.

Additional runs are rest runs. So, if I follow that strategy, my long run would be the 1.8 miles that I ran two days ago. My medium run would be 1.5 miles, and any additional runs would be 1 mile. I'm using the word \"runs\" but right now the \"runs\" are combinations of running and walking.I've been thinking about this as I type, and I think my fourth day, for a while at least, will be just walking with my wife.

{"title": "Making a change in my running", "date": "Wednesday, August 05, 2009", "text": "As I've mentioned a number of times in this blog, I was attacked by blood clots last January. After I left the hospital, I started walking, and I got my walking up to 1 1/2 miles. I then started to mix in small amounts of running. I continued with that distance and over a period of several weeks got the running portion of the distance up to a max of 1 mile and typically about 0.8 miles. I would run for .05 to .1 mile or so and then walk for about the same distance to recover. I then would repeat that sequence. However, recently I haven't been able to get much of an increase in the amount of running. It's as if I have reached a plateau in my running for that distance.I thus decided to try a different approach to regaining my running. I'm no longer concerned about the amount of running I do in my exercise. I'm just alternating running and walking in a way that feels comfortable for me. I am, however, increasing the total distance. About a week ago I increased the distance, and I made a second increase today. I'm making small increases so my body can better adjust to them. So far, I've enjoyed this new approach. I like being free from any psychological pressure to run for longer stretches before I walk. I just run until I feel like I should walk, and that is enjoyable to me.Today I made another small increase in my distance. I used my GPS to measure the total distance (1.7 miles). I left home about 9:30 am and enjoyed the cooler temperature (high 70s in the shade) and more shade on the path. I purposefully didn't take water with me due to the lower temperatures.  Since I had my GPS with me, I checked my pace while I was running. The pace was 14 minutes/mile, which is slow but not bad for an old guy recovering from blood clots :)My wakeup pulse rate has been 61-62 during the past week. Normally, with a pulse rate that high I wouldn't even go running, since my normal is about 50, but my energy level has been OK and I've gone out. I felt great this morning. This run was one of the best runs I've had for several weeks."},
{"title": "Just a touch of dizziness during my run", "date": "Monday, August 03, 2009", "text": "It was about 1 pm when I started my run (the same 1.6 miles that I've been running), and it was hot. The shade temperature was in the mid 80s (F) and the sun temperature was probably close to 100 (F). Most of my run was in the sun. I forgot to carry water, and I hoped the glass I had just before I left home would carry me through.That glass of water did carry me through most of the run, but I had a touch of dizziness during the last 500 or so yards. Two of the early signs of heat exhaustion are dizziness and headaches. When those happen, I usually stop running and head for a shady spot to rest for a few minutes before I walk home. Today, the dizziness was slight and didn't last long, so I continued my running and walking until I finished.Runners need to be careful when they run when it's hot, because heat exhaustion is a precursor to heat stroke, and heat stroke is a precursor to death! Literally! In heat stroke, ones body can no longer control the internal temperature of the body, and the temperature goes up and up and begins to cook ones brain and other internal organs. It is important to know and recognize the symptoms of heat exhaustion and heat stroke. Here is my page about running in bad conditions.I live in Utah, and the Jordan River Parkway, where I run, is at an elevation of 4300 - 4400 feet. That high altitude means runners get less oxygen with each breath and thus experience fatigue more than they would at a lower elevation. I was raised in Southern Utah (elevation about 5500 feet), but I've lived most of my adult life outside of Utah at relatively low elevations. When I moved back to Utah in December 1992, I experienced a lot of dizziness due to the higher altitude here. I would be walking down a sidewalk and would have an attack of dizziness. I would lose contact with the ground, and it would feel like I was walking in the air. It was hard to walk without feeling the ground. After about two years the dizziness went away. My low blood pressure (115/60) probably was a factor, too. Another factor about living in the desert is the low relative humidity of about 10%. That dryness means runners lose more moisture due to evaporation and thus need to drink more. It also means that runners cool more from evaporation of their sweat."},

Twice the doctors called my family in because they didn't think I'd make it. I did make it, and after I left the ICU I went to another hospital for therapy. Each time a new nurse would come into the room, the nurse would say, \"So, you're the runner I've heard about\".  In the months that followed the accident, I had surgery for a double hernia, six months of surgery for 10 Basal Cell skin cancers on my head, and my gall bladder removed. One of the cancers was as big around as a golf ball and 1/4 inch deep. I've had an interesting comeback with my running. Two years after the auto accident I ran the Great Salt Lake Half Marathon.In the middle of January 2009 I ran 7 miles on Saturday and finished a 23-mile week. Two days later I could only walk 100 feet before I had to sit down and rest. I was attacked by a million blood clots (well not quite that many). I gained about 38 pounds of water-weight from swelling in my legs and thighs.

The lady explained that in order to change my amounts of Wafarin (genetic Coumadin) they need  a prescription showing the amounts of fish oil and Niacin I should be taking. Then they can adjust the Warfarin to keep my INR number in the range of 2-3. So, I visited my doctor yesterday afternoon, and she faxed a prescription to the Coumadin Clinic. On the way home I checked several stores for 125 mg of Niacin but only found 500 mg amounts. Today I searched the web and ordered two bottles of 125 mg Niacin.

The bad news for today is that my wakeup pulse this morning was 62 (my normal is 50). That pulse reading means my body is very tired for some reason.

I was surprised to see that my oxygen level increased during my running, especially when going up small hills. The level was 96% when I started, and it went up to 99% during my runs. After I thought about it, I realized that my running was causing me to breath more deeply and more often, and that put more oxygen into my body. I had already determined on the evening the finger-clip arrived that I could increase the oxygen level by taking deep breaths.So, I decided that my getting tired during my running is either due to my body condition not being very good from the effect of the blood clots and my inactivity for several weeks while I was getting the swelling under control, or my clots haven't been dissolved yet, or both. My oxygen level is pretty good."},
{"title": "The  finger clip for measuring the oxygen-level came", "date": "Friday, June 26, 2009", "text": "The finger clip came yesterday. The clip displays both oxygen level and pulse rate,  and it is giving a surprising result.The pulse rate numbers are accurate and are within one beat of my measurement of my pulse at my right ear taken for a minute. My pulse rate last night was 77 plus or minus a couple of beats. The pulse rate this morning was in the mid 60s. In both cases, the numbers are significantly greater than my normal wake-up value of 50 and my daytime value of mid 50s. This increase in pulse rate isn't unusual, considering the sleep-deficit that I've been having the past couple of weeks (I'm still not doing very well in getting to bed earlier, and I still wake up around sunrise).The oxygen numbers last night and earlier this morning were 93-94%. They are above the 90% threshold that was used when I left the hospital 5 years ago after my auto accident. My oxygen was around 87% when I left, and for a couple of weeks I had to use an oxygen tank until my recovery improved and my oxygen level went above 90%. The last time I used the tank was during a visit to my doctor. She used a finger clip to measure my oxygen level. It was about 95%, and she took the tank away. The last time I had my oxygen level checked was a couple of years ago, and it maxed the clip at 100%. So values of 93-94% are above the threshold but not as good as they should be.However, I just woke up from an hour nap, and my pulse rate is 51 and my oxygen level is 96-97%. It appears that with proper rest, not only does my wakeup heart rate come down, which I already knew, but my oxygen level goes up. That makes sense. I'll use the clip for the next couple of weeks to see if that trend is correct.I also will take the clip with me when I run tomorrow to see if the oxygen level varies between my walking and my running. I won't use the clip while I'm moving but will stop for a few seconds and check my oxygen. I also will use the clip when I mow my lawns next week; I'm really curious to check my oxygen level while mowing, because that activity has been making me very tired and huff and puff in my breathing. In fact, it is that huffing and puffing that caused me to worry about my oxygen level."},

The scan showed multiple blood clots in my legs but none in my lungs. However, the doctor was concerned that I might have small clots in my lungs due to my heavy breathing from climbing stairs and while walking.As I've mentioned in previous posts, my recovery and ability to run again is going very slow, and I'm still breathing heavily while I run and especially while I mow my lawns. I don't breath heavily, though, when I climb one flight of stairs (15 steps) to my bedroom. In January, before I went to the hospital, I had sweat running down my face after climbing to my bedroom. My heavy breathing while I run and mow my lawns concerns me, so last night I bought a finger-clip that will measure my pulse rate and the oxygen level in my blood. The clip should arrive in 5 or 6 days. My blood level should be in the high 90%, and if it is below 90%, I'll revisit my doctor and probably go back to the hospital for more testing for blood clots in my lungs.As long as I don't die from all of this, this experience is pretty interesting. I've had almost perfect health for 72 years, and I'm enjoying the experience of being in a hospital, being tested, having mummy-looking legs, and wearing compression socks 24/7. If I do die prematurely, meaning before I'm 100, then that will be interesting too.Here are the pictures of the inside of my colon that I mentioned in my comment to the post just above this post.

I did run a bit farther on my first running segment, and my legs didn't feel as tired at that point as they have in the past. However, at the half way point I had run about the same distance (0.37 miles) as I've been doing. On the way back I felt nauseous, and I aborted my run about 200 feet from the end and made a bee-line for my car and then to home (the nausea was caused by my bowels needing attention, and there wasn't a porta-potty nearby, and due to a chain link fence, I couldn't go into the bushes. I did make it home ok, and the nausea was gone.I've felt fine during the day, although when I mowed my lawns this evening, I still got pretty tired. Before my blood-clot attack in January, I could mow the lawns without stopping and feel great at the end. Now, I have to stop and rest several times, and my legs and body feel tired. My total distance for the run was 0.85 miles for the 1.5 mile course.I've noticed for quite a while that my toes were a reddish color, as if they weren't getting enough blood. Last night I decided to sleep without my support stockings. Sure enough, when I got up this morning the reddish color was replaced with the normal skin color. In addition, I went to the bathroom several times during the night, and the volume of my urine was greater than the water I drank during the night, and my weight this morning was 4 pounds less than it was on Saturday. I'm not sure I understand this very well, but what I think happened was that by removing my compression socks, I got more blood into my feet, and that resulted in more blood going into my lymph system and down to my kidneys and out as urine. When I received therapy in February and March for the swelling in my feet, I was told to wear the compression socks for 2 years. However, the measurements I take each morning on my legs (I measure the circumference of my legs at 3 places) showed my feet weren't swelling any more. I've left the socks off all day, and I'll sleep without them tonight. Then I'll see if my measurements in the morning show any significant swelling."},
{"title": "Another 1.5 mile run/walk", "date": "Saturday, June 20, 2009", "text": "I was out about 9 am and did the 1.5 mile course again. I didn't have my GPS with me to measure the amount of running, but I think I did a bit more than on Wednesday. Probably 1.1 miles or so. There are two places that I use as a judge of how much running I'm doing. The first place is at the beginning of the run, and the second place is at the beginning of the return leg. In both places I ran about 200 feet more than I've been running. I can't use any guideposts in the middle of the run since I don't have an absolute place to start those phases. At the beginning of the out-phase and at the beginning of the return-phase I have a consistent starting place.After my run I went to a local hospital for a health fair and had my cholesterol checked. It was 162. Six months ago it was 240 (I've been eating less cheese and red meat during the six months). That 162 is the lowest I've ever had. My glucose number was 74 (80 to 120 is considered good), so I'm better than that. My blood pressure was 117/70. My eye test wasn't good, though. My right eye is 20/50 and my left eye is 20/40. Both eyes together are 20/70. I've been aware that I was starting to have problems in my distance-vision, and this confirms that. I'll have to get to an eye doctor before my drivers license comes due in October. Considering everything, I'm in pretty good health for an old guy.My wakeup pulse rate is high. This is probably due to my not getting enough sleep in past weeks. Even though I'm doing better in getting sleep, it takes time for my body to recover from the lack of sleep. When I was in marathon training 25 years ago, it would take me a couple of weeks to recover from lack of sleep, and due to my it probably takes more time than that now. After my pulse rate comes down, I should do better in my running, although my legs are my weakest point right now."},

I usually stop running and walk the last 0.1 miles, but today (and the day I ran 1.01 miles) I ran to the end of the course. That is a good sign, indicating my body is slowly getting stronger. Many people would ignore small signs of improvement, such as running the last 0.1 mile, but I notice them. They are signs that I am improving, and they help keep positive my attitude and emotions about my running.Before my run, I drove to my son's house in the west part of the valley, and it was starting to rain as I got there. However, the central part of the valley, where I run, was partly sunny, and I completed my run with no rain. It is now starting to rain at my house. Not a big downpour, just a gentle rain.

The snails in my flower gardens are getting a holiday since I didn't put out the snail bait today as I had planned.Other than feeling tired, it was a nice run. There was a walker behind me. She was walking faster than I was walking, and during my walks she would almost catch up to me, and then I would start running and pull ahead of her. At the turn-around point, I stopped for a couple of minutes to look at the river, and the walker came to the turn-around point, and we spoke for a couple of minutes. She said we had talked last summer when it was awfully hot; I recognized her face, but I don't remember our conversation. She thanked me for helping her last summer during the heat. I guess I suggested she drink more water or walk slower or something like that.There is a family of rocks chucks living in the rocks at the turn-around point of the path. I've seen them on several occasions. Last Saturday I saw four of them poking their heads out of their hole or sitting on rocks. Including their tails, they are about 18 inches long, and their body looks like it has a diameter of about 4 - 6  inches. I mention their size so you will know they aren't gophers.  If I remember I'll carry my camera tomorrow on Wednesday and see if I can get a picture of them. In the meantime here is a picture of a rock chuck that I found on the Internet.

{"title": "I reached next week's running goal today!", "date": "Saturday, June 13, 2009", "text": "I mentioned in my last post that my goal of reaching 1 mile of running in the 1.5 miles of my workout would likely be reached on Wednesday of next week. I was pleasantly surprised that my body performed better today than I had expected, and I reached 1.02 miles or 68% of the total distance. My legs didn't feel as tired as they have in the past, and my body didn't feel tired either; I was able to breath fine. It will be interesting to see what happens on Monday. I'm avoiding the temptation to push for more distance and am just letting my body tell me when to stop running.The temperature during my run was in the low 70s (F) and the sky was cloudy. A great day for running.My blood clots really weakened my body. On the Monday that I discovered the clots, I could only walk 50-100 feet, and going up stairs to my bedroom was really hard and my head was covered with sweat. I was in the hospital for 5 days and did a small amount of walking there -- I got up to about 400 feet. I gained almost 30 pounds of water-weight in my hips and legs, and I had therapy for two months to get rid of the water; the therapy consisted of bandaging my legs with 5 or 6 layers of compress stockings, closed-cell foam, and Ace bandages to hold all of it together. This put a lot of compression on my legs to force the water from the swelling to go into my lymph system and then out through my bladder. After the therapy was over, I started to wear thick compression stockings, which I will have to wear for two years.Upon returning home, I got my walking up to 1.5 miles, and then I started merging in some jogging. At first I could only jog for a short distance. Even though I've been running for 36 years, I'm starting over as a beginner since my body is taking longer to return to running than I had expected. For example, after my auto accident 5 years ago, I started with 1/8 mile or running, but I was able to add 10% each week, and I soon returned to the 7 miles I had been running before the accident. This time, however, I'm progressing at a much slower rate.I like to be positive about my life, and I realize that having to start over in running is actually a good thing. I'm using myself as an experiment of one to test my philosophy of not following a plan but letting ones body dictate how fast increases in distance or speed should occur. The results of this experiment of one are good -- my body is a much better manager of my training than any training plan could be. Training plans are written for a fictitious person and should be modified and adapted to the person using the plan, while my body knows exactly how much stress it can handle. So far, the results are good. I'm improving each week and I haven't overtrained such that I get injured or depressed. It's true that my progress is taking longer than I had expected, but that just shows the severity of the impact of the blood clots on my body.  I'm being reassured that my philosophy of beginning running is good, and I think I will have more compassion and understanding of beginning runners who are having a difficult time getting their body trained."},

The first run is relatively long, and the runs get shorter as the workout proceeds. Today my first run was the longest I've done since I was attacked by blood clots, approximately 1/4 mile. The rest of the runs were about the same as they were on Wednesday, and I would guess that my total running was about 60% of the total distance.The following article was written by Aleta Taylor, a member of the South Jordan City Council, and appeared in the South Valley Journal for June 4, 2009. She wrote about a jogger who picked up trash as he ran. Her description, except for the age she ascribed to the runner, fits me to a \"T\". I do run the Parkway, and I've never seen other runners pick up trash (readers of this blog know I do pick up a lot of trash). I do wear red shorts and a wide-brim hat, and my wife says I have sexy legs. Here is the article.-------------------------Some time ago as I ran along our own Jordan River trail I observed a singular phenomenon that reminded me how great it is to be part of this fast growing and diverse city of South Jordan. Up ahead of me I watched a jogger who stopped no less than five times in about a half mile to gather a bit of trash, then carry it with him while he jogged to the next garbage container. Kudos to South Jordan City Parks.  There were garbage containers placed about every 200 yards. It wasn't just the fact that he picked up garbage that caught my attention, or even his multiple stops, it was the fact that he must have been in his late eighties or nineties and even with his stops, I never quite caught up to him.Mr. Jogger in red shorts and safari hat, you inspire me. Yes you! You will always remind me of what is right in South Jordan. Our people really are the salt of the earth, and not just because they enjoy the out-of-doors and sweat a lot, either. I am honored to represent such a diversity of caring individuals and neighborhoods where people pay attention and get involved in the needs of their community.And, by the way, nice legs, Mr. Mystery Jogger. If I see you again I'll be sure and learn your name. After all, isn't that what it's all about; older people being able to enjoy our community in all its facets with a reasonable expectation of safety and enjoyment?

That is the most I've run during my recovery from the blood clots that attacked me in January. That number shows that my gut-feel estimates of 50% that I've been making are pretty close to the real value. I could tell that I was doing a bit more running this morning.As I've explained in past posts, I don't push myself to get more distance. I just let my body and legs tell me when to stop running and to walk for a minute or so. I don't experience any pain or soreness, just a tired feeling in my legs. A short walk is sufficient for my legs to recover and to let me run again. Another sign that I'm getting stronger is how I feel when I finish. When I first started jogging earlier this spring, I was pretty tired when I finished the 1.5 miles, even though most of the distance was done via walking. I felt fine this morning and could have gone farther if I had wanted to. However, I don't want to increase my overall distance until I can run all of the 1.5 miles and feel pretty good at the end.The temperature during my run was in the mid to high 70s (F), and I ran earlier to avoid the high heat that we'll have later this afternoon. It was a pleasant day, not much wind, lots of sun, beautiful clouds, and a great time for a morning jaunt!I'm doing better in getting my 7 hours of sleep at night, plus an afternoon nap, and that helps my running.Some of my 1.5 mile course borders a golf course, although the course is across the Jordan River and is in the city of Sandy. While I was running, I heard a noise that sounded like a fire cracker, and I saw a white object bounce from the asphalt path into some grass and weeds. The ball landed about 10 feet (3 meters) in front of me. The river at that point is quite wide, probably 200 feet. The ball cleared the river and the Russian Olive trees that border the Parkway path and hit right in the middle of the path. Because of the trees I didn't see the ball coming. It just fell out of the sky and with a loud crack bounced off the path. I don't play golf, but I'm keeping the ball in my car, and later this fall when I've mastered the 1.5 mile course and am heading south, I'll throw the ball onto a golf course that is near 106th South and borders the path. This is the 3rd ball I've recovered while I was running. The other two balls were from the course near 106th."},

I think I'll take my GPS on Wednesday and measure the total distance that I run.I've noticed during the past week that the Jordan River has a higher water level than it did earlier in the spring. Most of the water in the river is pumped from Utah Lake in Provo county, and some of the water comes from creeks that drain into the river. The higher level in the river shows that we are having a good spring in terms of snow melt and rain. This is good because the cities around here get their water from large reservoirs in the mountains, and more water in the reservoirs means more water will be available during our hot summer."},

My legs felt stronger today than they have in the past.In my previous post I said that I was visiting in New England (Massachusetts and Connecticut) but that I wasn't doing any running due to schedule conflicts. I do have one regret about not running: the low elevation. The altitude at the places I was staying was sea level to a few hundred feet, compared to 4400 feet here. That difference in altitude makes a big difference in how I feel as I run. During my 17 years in New England, I made a few trips west to visit family, and I could tell the difference in how I felt as I ran. After I moved to Utah in December 1993, it took me about a year to feel comfortable with the higher altitude. In fact, during the first few months in Utah, I would have bouts of being dizzy -- I wouldn't be able  to feel the sidewalk as I walked, any I thus lost my sense of balance and felt like I would fall down. I've always had low blood pressure, and I would feel dizzy as a child if I stood up quickly. Because of this, I assumed the bouts of dizziness were due to my low blood pressure, and I didn't worry about them. After a few months, the dizziness went away."},

When going downhill, I ran about 0.1 miles before walking 200 - 300 feet. I walked when going up hill, because I'm not ready for hills. Compared to running along the Jordan River Parkway in Utah, I'm going twice as far and running about twice as far before walking. That, coupled with the fact that the Parkway is flat while Redmond is hilly (25-50 foot elevation change in the hills) means I've made good improvement while here. The elevation in Redmond is about 3100 feet while the elevation on the Parkway is about 4400 feet, and the lower elevation has helped, too.The weather during my workout was cloudy, cold, and a slight mist falling. The temperature was probably in the mid to high 40s (F). I felt warm while running, but slightly cold while walking, and my bare arms got pretty cold while walking.While I was running/walking along the road, I decided to change plans and hike up a really big hill to get a great panoramic view of the Cascade Mountains to the west. However, after walking about a quarter mile on a dirt road and going 60 feet higher in elevation, I aborted the hike. I could tell my legs weren't ready for a 1000 foot peak. In addition, if anything happened to me, people wouldn't think of me being on that dirt road, since my wife expected me to be running the paved road. It would have been a nice view, though....Later: It has been cloudy all day with rain showers here and there. I'm not sure the Cascades would have been visible from the peak.I measured my legs yesterday and this morning, and they did swell after Saturday's workout.

I went out for my 1.5 mile walk/jog and ended up doing 5 miles. I didn't take a map with me, and  I got lost on the way back. Thanks to my cell phone, I was able to call my son on my cell who had a map and gave me directions. However, I still took  a couple of wrong turns and ended up doing a long loop instead of a short out-back.This is a nice place for running. We're staying at the Eagle Crest Resort which is 4 miles from Redmond. Lots of tall juniper trees, not much traffic, and a nice [low 50s (F)] sunny spring  day. We had rain mixed with snow all day yesterday, so today was a pleasant change. This area is hilly, and I quickly learned that I'm not ready for hills. I walked up the hills and jogged down them.I had my GPS with me to measure my total distance, but I didn't measure how far I jogged. I just jogged until my body told me it was time to walk. I would guess, though, that my jogging totaled about a mile, usually in spurts of 200 - 400 feet.When I got to the 0.75 mile mark, where I expected to turn around, I was just getting to the outskirts of the houses and condos, and I decided to go a bit further. When I got to the 1.1 mark, I did turn around. On the way back, however, I made some wrong turns and ended up doing a large loop. This reminds me of the time in Massachusetts that I ran a new route and missed a turn, and  my 7 mile run became a 12 mile run. When I go walking/jogging again on Friday, I'll pay more attention to the street signs while going out. Today, my attention was on the beautiful houses set in the beautiful trees, and I didn't check the street signs very well."},

Because of their height, I didn't recognize the trees as being Junipers. Utah is covered with Juniper trees, and they are short and bushy like, while the Oregon Junipers are tall and relatively wide. The early Mormon pioneers called the trees Cedar trees, and my home town of Cedar City, Utah was named after the trees. This morning while running, I got a close look at the trees, and I could tell they were Junipers. They had the same type of bark and needles as the Utah trees. Instead of being 8 - 10 feet tall, as they are in Utah, the Junipers here are 25 - 40 feet tall."},

Yesterday my weight was 162.0 pounds. Losing 1.8 pounds in one day is, I think, from reduced swelling rather than from consuming less calories. Losing 1.8 pounds from calories would mean I reduced my caloric intake by 6300 calories, all within 24 hours. How's that for a super diet :) So, I think my swelling is gone. I'm supposed to wear my compression stockings for two years. So far it's been three months. I think I'll wear them for another three months and then take them off as a test. If my swelling doesn't return (I measure each morning the circumference of each leg at three points, ankle, mid calf,and mid quad) after a week without the stockings, I'll call the clinic at the Intermountain Health Center and see what the practitioner, Liz, thinks about leaving the stockings off permanently."},

I recovered quickly during my recovery walks and as I drove home.I walked/jogged during dusk (it was just getting dark as I finished), and I heard a frog croaking near the bank of the Jordan River. The frog didn't have the fast, light sound of a New England peeper. It had a big, throaty croak. It's the first time in several years of running the Jordan River Parkway that I've heard a frog.

I didn't sleep very well last night due to my smoke detectors going off about every half hour for most of the night. The alarms started a few minutes after midnight and would sound for a few seconds and then turn off. It was hard to tell which alarm was causing the problem, because the alarms are tied together such that they all go off even though only one detector may originate the alarms. There was no fire or smoke in the house, and the alarms were false alarms. I was glad last night that the detectors weren't monitored by an alarm company, but in the case of a real fire, it would be nice to have them monitored.

I don't know if that 4 pounds is actual weight gain due to my running less, or if it is water weight from the swelling, or some of both. I weighed 1/2 pound less this morning than yesterday morning, and that implies it was a loss of water as my swelling goes down. Each morning I measure the circumference of my legs at three places on the legs (ankle, mid calf, and middle of the quads). The numbers aren't changing much, indicating that any water from the swelling is on my stomach. My stomach is bigger than it should be, so that means water weight there or actual fat there....I haven't been measuring my wakeup heart rate lately, so I don't know how it is doing."},

I felt stronger during and after the walk than I did on Thursday. Then, in late afternoon I rototilled my two gardens. The 'tilling took about 2 hours. 'Tilling is a lot of work, because I have to turn the tiller by pushing on the handles. Sometimes, depending on the lay of the garden, I can turn the 'tiller while it is moving, and that is easier. Other times I have to stop the 'tiller and turn it while it is stopped, a much harder task. Another reason 'tilling is stressful on my legs is that I'm walking on loose ground, and my feet sink into the dirt and turn and twist in the dirt. I have stiff ankles, and I like to walk/run on a hard surface that doesn't give, because my ankles aren't twisted as much. I was tired when I finished the 'tilling, but not as tired as I was after just my walk on Thursday. So, my body is getting stronger, but it has a long ways to go to regain the strength it had before my \"blood clot\" attack in January. If I feel OK on Monday, I'll merge in about 10% jogging with my walking, doing the 1.5 mile route again. That would be about 0.15 miles of jogging, scattered throughout the walking.

The kids left last night to go to their home, but they will be back tonight. So, I took advantage of being home alone today, and I walked the 1.5 mile northward path again this afternoon. I met a guy named Thomas while I was walking. He likes to walk, too. I enjoyed visiting with him, because he knows a lot about the river and the small creeks that feed the river. Thomas said that we were walking on top of a dike that borders the river in that area. The dike was originally built to protect the farmers who lived near the river. I had noticed that the path was higher than the fields, but I hadn't paid attention to that observation. The path is about two feet higher than the fields, and the other side drops sharply to the river.The river was very low today because the dam that is near the end of the path is wide open and is letting more water go downstream. Thomas said the dam begins on an island that was built in the river. The dam goes across the river to the other side. Going the other way from the island is a flood gatefor a spill-way. A canal takes water from the river just before the dam. If the canal gets too much water in it, the flood gate is opened to let excess water flow around the island and go back into the river.The temperature today was in the low 70s (F), and it was pleasant to be outside. I hope to do the 1.5 miles again on Saturday, and then next week I'll start mixing in small amounts of jogging with my walking.

The temperature was in the high 40s (F). Birds were chirping and ducks were swimming. The sun was shining, and it was a nice day to be outside. I only passed one other person during my walk, an older gentleman who was running and was huffing and puffing as he went past. I thought to myself that it is interesting to be on the other side -- a walker seeing runners go by. I had a tinge of jealousy as the runner went past, but I assured myself that I would soon be running past the walkers.My last day of running was Monday, January 12, exactly two months ago. During that run I ran and walked the north segment. I went home, took a two-hour nap, and found when I woke up that I could only walk 50 feet before I was tired. I ended up in the hospital with blood clots in my legs. During my two months of recovery, I've thought about the Parkway, and I have been anxious to get back to the Parkway to see what changes have occurred since that run. Today I fulfilled that goal.The chain-link fence that was partly installed in January is finished. An old, rusty cooking grill that was near the path is gone, as is a garbage can full of cans and other junk that was near the grill. I was pleased to see that those items were gone, because they were a real eyesore and detracted from the beauty of the Parkway.I pick up a lot of litter during my runs, and since I haven't run for two months I expected to see a lot of litter today. I did see some, and picked up most of it, but I saw less litter than I had expected. My experience in the past has been that runners and walkers are good at not dropping litter along the path. Much of the litter is blown in by the wind. The north segment of the Parkway won't get much litter from the wind, because there isn't any new construction along the Parkway, and there is about an eighth of a mile of fields separating  nearby houses from the Parkway.I just found out that this blog is one of the 20 finalists in the Chapeau Blog Awards competition.

It takes my wife an hour to reapply the bandages after I've had a shower. I look like a mummy (at least the legs of a mummy).The bandages put compression on my legs, and that helps my lymph system to function correctly. My arteries take blood from my heart to other parts of my body. My veins return 90% of that blood back to my heart. The remaining 10% goes into my lymph system and goes up my body to my shoulders, across my body, and down to my kidneys and then out as urine.

In the beginning my legs were big as if I were a football player. Now, they are thinner and look more like runner's legs. I still have a lot of water in my stomach and genitals, but I look and feel a lot better. For the past several days I've been losing 2+ pounds of body fluids per 24-hour day. I  have to go to the bathroom every couple hours, because the body fluid being eliminated goes through my lymph system into my kidneys and out as urine. I'm also drinking a lot of water to help flush out my  kidneys and urinary tract.The therapist also measures the circumference  of my legs every two cm. to track the decrease in swelling.  She has a computer program that converts the numbers to volume, and leg has lost about two liters of fluid.So, things are progressing well. I won't do any running until the swelling is gone and my blood clots are gone too. The swelling should be gone in the next couple of weeks, but I don't know how long it takes for blood clots to get dissolved."},

{"title": "Welcome home, Allen!", "date": "Wednesday, January 21, 2009", "text": "I haven't posted to thus blog recently because I've been away from the Internet for 5 days at a plush resort. I said the resort was plush, because room service brought all of my meals to my room (great food). I had personal service from both male and female valets who attended to my every need. Maids cleaned my room every day. A pretty nice place! Where is this resort? At the new hospital recently built by the Intermountain Health Care.Friday was a bad day. My condition got worse, and I finally realized that I was suffering from more than overuse in my training.It took me two hours to get ready to see a doctor. All I had to do was shower and brush my teeth, but I could only stand or walk for a few seconds and then had to sit for 15 minutes while I recovered. The 15 minutes was for the pain and stiffness in my legs to subside. My faster breathing went away after just a few seconds.I knew if I drove to the main hospital I would never be able to walk the long distance from the parking lot to the ER, so I drove to the IHC Instant Care about a mile from my home. The nurses there immediately realized I needed to be in a hospital, and they transported me to the main hospital in an ambulance. I arrived there about 11 pm.It took the ER nurses, technicians, and doctor 7 hours to check me out. The conclusion was that I had several blood clots in my legs. The CAT scan didn't show any clots in my lungs, but the ER doctor felt that I probably had some small ones that were causing me get tired after just a few seconds of activity.I left the ER and went to a regular room, where the doctor and nurses and techs there tried to figure out why I had the clots. They asked if I had recently been on long (5-7 hours) airplane flights in which I wasn't moving around. Nope. I did tell them that I would spend several hours at my computer without moving around. I was put on Coumidan and was told I would probably have to stay on it for the rest of my life since these clots were a relapse from my having clots four years ago after an auto accident on April 19, 2004. I'm taking Coumidan once a day, and I'm getting Lovenox shots twice a day.I didn't get any sleep Friday night, and I spent most of Saturday taking short naps. I got more sleep Saturday night, but still not my normal 7 hours.I was hooked up to an EKG 27/7 so the nurses could monitor my heart. No problem there. They scanned the arteries in my legs but found no clots. The clots found at the ER were in my veins. They did an ultrascan of my heart and it looked fine. My breathing (lungs and chest), blood pressure, and temperature were checked many times during each day and were fine. I was on oxygen for a day but was taken off because my oxygen rate without my breathing from a tank was 98-100 and I didn't need extra oxygen. My main symptoms were swelling in my feet and not being able to walk very far or even to stand very long.On Sunday my pulse rate while sitting quietly was in the low 70s. On Monday the rate dropped to the low 60s, a sign that my body was beginning to not need a lot of extra oxygen via a faster heart beat rate. On Tuesday the rate was still in the low 60s, and this morning before I left the hospital the rate dropped slightly. However, as of the time I left the hospital the swelling in my feet hadn't gone down.The doctor told me to walk as much as I could. I did a lot of walking in my room due to frequently going to the bathroom because of the water I was drinking. On Sunday afternoon I took a short walk in the hallway and went about 100 feet before I had to sit down and rest. On Monday I increased my walk to, maybe, 250 feet before I had to sit down, and on Tuesday I went about 400 feet and repeated it twice, once in the afternoon and once in the Evening. During these walks, it only took about 5 minutes for the soreness in my legs to go away, and the groin-pain that I had over the week end after walking was gone.I haven't walked much since getting home today about noon, so I don't know if I've regressed or not in my walking ability. It does look, though, like the swelling in my feet has gone down a bit tonight.My toes have a better color to them, too. More like the natural color of my skin. Earlier in the week my toes were a light reddish/purple color, and they were starting to get a darker tone to them. Some of that color was due to my wearing compression socks that the doctor prescribed for me to reduce the swelling. Instead of doing that, the socks reduced the blood circulation in my feet. After two days of wearing the socks I took them off without asking the doctor about it.As soon as I finish this post and get some water in a pitcher, I'll go upstairs to my bed. I'm curious to see how I do with the stairs. On Friday evening I was huffing and puffing and sweating after going up the stairs.I'm glad to be alive. The doctor told me that if I hadn't come in as soon as I did, the clots could have gone into my lungs and presented a serious problem to my staying alive (by the time I left the hospital, the doctors had decided I didn't have any clots in my lungs). I actually should have come in a couple of days sooner than I did."},

{"title": "Found out why I had low temperature readings", "date": "Wednesday, January 14, 2009", "text": "I figured out this evening the cause of the low temperature readings. Not leaving the thermometer in my mouth long enough. It is a digital thermometer, and I haven't used it for a couple of years; I'd forgotten that I had to wait for a telephone like string of beeps to tell me that the thermometer was finished. My temperature currently is 98.1, and I sweated slightly from walking up and down the stairs a few minutes ago. That slight sweating fits in with my slight temperature (my normal temperature is about 96.5). This makes sense. If I really had a temp of 91+ I should have been in hypothermia and almost ready to go into a coma. So, the low temp is a non-issue. I didn't take my temperature a few days ago when I was sweating more from moving about, and the temperature then was likely a few degrees higher. Having the temperature come down is a good sign.I'm still able to go up and down the stairs fine, in contrast to the first 24 hours when I couldn't do that.Now that the temperature thing is resolved, all of my symptoms point to a simple case of overuse. I did a lot of snow shoveling during the week after Christmas. We had one storm of 6-8 inches of wet heavy snow, and I spent four hours shoveling my driveway/sidewalks and those of a neighbor who was out of town. Then we had several storms of 3-4 inches of light, fluffy snow that was pretty easy to shovel. Also, I spent an hour helping clear my daughter's driveway of 8 inches of heavy snow. All of this would have put stress on my body. During this time I was doing a weekly run of 10 miles and another one of 8 miles -- more stress. I knew I was tired and had shortened the 8 mile run a couple of times. Apparently I needed even more rest, and my body succumbed to the stress with soreness in my right buttock and in my groin. I stretched my buttock, and that soreness was gone after 24 hours. My groin soreness is slowly going away, as witnessed by the reduced temperature, no problem climbing stairs, and being able to walk further before the groin-soreness comes in. Another thing that tells me my problem is overuse is that I feel fine when sitting down, even for several hours of sitting down.I haven't been doing my groin stretches during the past few days, and I'll start doing them tomorrow for several days to help my body overcome the stress in my groin. I usually do them before each run, but I had skipped them during the runs last week. Having weak groin muscles is not a good thing, because those muscles control the alignment of the knee cap as it moves up and down the knee.I have a friend, Bruce, in Las Vegas, and one of the visitors to his blog used the word \"brittle\" to describe how our bodies age. I like that word. Something that is brittle cracks under stress rather than bending.\"Brittle\" describes my body. Up until I was 71, I didn't notice a lot of difference in my body then as compared to my body when I was younger. But, in the subsequent two years, I've discovered that my body is aging and is becoming more \"brittle\". I'm having to make increases in distance and speed at a slower rate than I did two years ago. I'm having to allow more time for recovery after a stressful run than I did two years ago. Yes, my body is becoming \"brittle\"."},
{"title": "Some progress in my leg and some not-so-good-conditions", "date": "Tuesday, January 13, 2009", "text": "I usually get up several times during the night to go to the bathroom. I drink water just before I go to bed, and each time I get up I drink more water. I discovered last evening that the problem was with my right buttock not my hamstring. Before going to bed, I did my buttock stretches, and I could tell the stretch of my right buttock was centered on the muscle having the problem. Each time I got up during the night, I did the buttock stretches. The first time during the night that I did the stretches, my right leg was still sore, but the leg was not sore during subsequent stretches or throughout today. This was a good improvement.I am now free of the problem in my right leg that caused me to abort my run yesterday, but the stiffness in both legs and low energy that I mentioned yesterday is still there when I walk a few feet or more. Also, when I walk I sweat profusely as if I were in a steam room. I took my temperature, and it was 91.5 (F), and I said to self, \"I'm dead!\" I tried it again and left the thermometer in my mouth for about 5 minutes, and the reading was 94.1 My normal temperature is 96-97. I decided I probably need a new battery for the thermometer. I don't feel like I have a temperature. Again, I can sit or lie in bed for hours with no problems, but as soon as I walk I have the symptoms that I've mentioned. Climbing stairs is still a problem, too.I'm stretching my hams and quads and calves during the day to see if that helps with the stiffness in my legs.I took my blood pressure about an hour before I went to bed, and it was normal (115/69). Dr. Gabe Mirkin says the best time to take blood pressure is in the evening, because the BP should go down in the evening, and if it doesn't go down, that is a good indication of a circulation problem.Very, very strange! But, at least the buttock problem is gone. I was worried that I might have injured a muscle, and I was relieved to learn that it was only a stressed muscle.Later: When I went upstairs to go to bed, I found out that I can climb the stairs OK. That is a good sign."},
{"title": "My run started out great, but...", "date": "Monday, January 12, 2009", "text": "My wakeup heart rate was 52 this morning. I had a good energy level, and I looked forward to my run. After my walking warmup, I started the run shortly after 12:oo noon. The sky was sunny, the high temperature was expected to be in the low 40s (F), and itr was a beautiful day for running.After I had run about a third of a mile, I felt what I thought was a cramp coming in the hamstring of my right leg. I immediately stopped running, and about two seconds after I stopped, the cramp hit. I felt the muscle that was cramping, and it was very hard. I stretched my hams for a few seconds while massaging the muscle. The muscle felt better, and I started running. I could tell the cramp was still there, and I stopped and repeated the stretching and massaging. I again started running and stopped within a few steps due to the cramp.My leg felt OK when walking, so I walked to the end of the new north path and back to the parking lot (1.5 miles total), all the time massaging the muscle. The massaging didn't reduce the hardness of the muscle, so I aborted my run and went home.Later: The condition in my leg is more serious than I had realized. My leg feels fine while I'm sitting, but if I walk, both of my legs tighten up and I can feel the \"cramp\" in my right leg, and I have a very low energy level. Climbing the stairs to my bedroom to take an afternoon nap was painful in my right leg.This is really a strange situation. I felt great in the morning before my run, but after a third of a mile, I didn't feel good at all."},

{"title": "I ran 10 miles again, along the Jordan River Parkway", "date": "Thursday, January 08, 2009", "text": "My wakeup heart rate was 52 yesterday and today. Even though my heart rate was down yesterday, I felt tired during the day, and I was glad I'd decided to not run yesterday. I felt pretty good today, and my legs felt fine for the first 7 miles. During the eighth mile, my right leg was tired, and I took extra walking breaks. During the last two miles, that leg felt better. In fact, during the last mile, I felt strong and ran a consistent pace like I had run during the first few miles.The temperature during the run was in the low 40s (F), and there was a lot of water from melting snow running over the path. I waited until early afternoon to start my run to give the sun more time to melt snow and ice, but I made sure I would be finished before the sun set and the path iced up. There was a 5-7 mph headwind going out and a tailwind coming back.As I ran down a residential street that acts as a detour for a portion of the Parkway path that isn't finished, I passed two kids walking home from school. One of them gave me a thumbs-up and said, \"You're doing great!\" I smiled and waved at them. A minute later I passed a man getting into his car. He smiled and said I should turn around so I would have the wind at my back. I smiled back and said that I would be turning around in a short time and had to go back to 98th South (he was at 119th South, approximately).There are two aspects to conquering a distance. The first phase is the ability to complete the distance. Most runners who train for a half marathon or a full marathon only train enough to do this phase. They complete their race, but they typically suffer soreness, pain, and perhaps injuries during and after the race. Some of them get discouraged and give up on distance running.The second phase is your body being able to handle the stress of the distance, such that the distance is now a \"breeze in the park\" so to speak. It takes doing the distance several times before your body becomes strong enough to handle the stress. Most marathoners only accomplish this phase after running several half or full marathons.  Many people only complete one or two marathons and never accomplish the second phase. We're all different, and some people accomplish this phase after running the distance two or three times, while other people need many repetitions of the distance before their body can handle the stress.Today was my 3rd time to run 10 miles, and I think I'm starting to get used to that distance. I'm not claiming that my body has gotten used to the 10-mile distance, but I think it is starting to do that. I felt better today after completing the run than I did after my first two times of doing that distance, although I'm still tired after doing 10 miles. I forgot to take a short nap when I got home from my run, and I sorta moped around and didn't do much for the rest of the day.On my way back I saw a flock of geese (perhaps 100 or so) foraging on a large lawn that surrounds a picnic area. This was the third time this winter that I've seen them foraging that way. I don't know if they were looking for insects or for grass. They are beautiful birds. Here is a picture from the web showing geese foraging on a lawn. Click for a larger image.Mallard ducks come in two colors: brown females and brightly colored males. The geese, however, seem to only come in one color. I've probably seen up close a dozen or so flocks of geese, and they have all looked alike. I don't know if this means they were all males, or if the males and females have the same coloring. (later) Here is a picture I just found on the web showing, I assume, the parents of two goslings. The parents have the same coloring. This makes more sense than having just males foraging on the lawn.The most spectacular view I've had of a flock of geese was the time a few years ago they flew over me about 15 feet above me. It was thrilling to be so close to them! Here is a picture from the web of geese flying. Beautiful birds!"},

I've been sleeping well, so a lack of sleep wasn't the problem. It could be the stress from my 10 and 8 mile runs last week. Because of my older age, I need more time to recover from a long run. What ever the reason, something is causing my heart to beat 20% faster than it usually does. I'm taking today as a rest day. If my heart rate is down in the low 50s tomorrow, I'll do my weekly 5-mile run. If it is still high, I'll take another rest day tomorrow.Our night time temperatures have been in the single digits this week, and our mid-day maximums have been in the mid 20s (F). We've had an inch or two of snow each day and another inch or so each night. The daytime temps should go up to the 40s this week, with the night temps in the 20s. Also, the snow is supposed to stop, but some rain showers are forecast for Thursday. The warmer temps will help melt some of the ice and snow that are everywhere. I'd like to run the Jordan River Parkway instead of 27th West. The parkway should be plowed, but there will be some ice on the trail. I'll take my ice cleats with me if I go running tomorrow.I found out yesterday that a neighbor a few houses down the street slipped on ice in front of her house, and she broke a leg when she fell. It was a pretty bad break, and she had surgery on her leg. She is young, probably in her 30s, and should have healthy bones, so she must have landed pretty hard. I think I was blessed when I slipped on ice a year ago. I bruised my buttocks and back, but I didn't have any broken bones. It did, though, take about three months for the bruises to heal.

Most of the path was either free from ice or had large patches of asphalt without ice, so I was able to run without much risk of slipping. There were only a few places where I stopped and walked over ice. On the way out, the ice was hard and slippery, but on the way back it was soft and slushy. Interesting how much two hours of warmer air can soften ice.My wakeup heart rate was 53 this morning. I was a little tired during the run, but not nearly as much as last Monday. At the end of the 10 miles I felt better than I did on Monday after 3.5 miles. I was the only runner on the path. I did see two walkers, but I guess most of the \"regulars\" were home in their warm houses.While running past the picnic tables that are south of 106th South, I heard voices coming from the Jordan River. Shouts of encouragement and glee indicated the people were having a lot of fun. I looked through the trees and saw three kayaks in the river. I couldn't see the full boats, but I saw enough to identify them as kayaks. On my way back, I saw several people placing the boats on top of their cars in preparation for their trip home."},

Part of the problem was that the Jordan River Parkway was covered with half an inch of snow and/or soft ice, and that is like running in sand -- a lot of slippage of my shoes. However, the main problem was that my body was tired. I went slow and enjoyed being outside, even though it was a struggle to finish the run. I've had a couple weeks of good running, and my body needed more rest than it got over the weekend.The temperature was about 40 (F) during my run. The snow and ice was melting some, but a 5-10 mph wind kept the melting to a minimum. I ran in the late afternoon and made sure I was finished before the sun went down.

I expected the sidewalks and streets to be icy and snowy, and I wore my ice cleats on my running shoes. I found out that the sidewalks hadn't been plowed since the blizzard a couple of days ago, and I thus ran in the street. The asphalt was bare where the cars and trucks were driving, but it was icy and snowy along the edges.While going out, my cleats did well, and I had no problems with the ice and snow, However, at three miles, the cleats came off when I went through some 4-5 inch deep snow. I needed a place to sit down and take off  my shoes while I put the cleats back on and didn't see anything that could be used as a chair, so I stuffed the cleats in my jacket pocket and ran without them. The ice along the edge of the road was soft and not slick, and I had no problem running without the cleats.With just a half-mile to go to reach my turnaround, I decided to abort that half-mile because the snow was deeper along the edge of the road, and it was difficult to run. I thus did 7 miles instead of my planned 8 miles.On the way back, I could tell I was getting tired due to the inch or so of snow along the edge (running in snow and slush is like running in sand, shoes slip with each step). I started walking through the snow when cars were passing, and I ran on the bare asphalt when there were no cars passing. That method worked fine, and I made it home with no slips on the ice or encounters with autos. I also felt pretty good when I got home. So, I would say it was a good winter run. The temperature was 25 (F) when I left home and 23 when I returned. The forecast for the next three days is temps in the low 40s during the day, and that should clear the streets and Jordan River Parkway for good running. However, more snow is forecast for Tuesday evening.On the way back, I saw a young girl who had gotten her pickup stuck in some deep snow. She was trying to leave a school parking lot and enter 27th West, and there was a ridge of deep snow that was left by the snow plow earlier in the day. I crossed the street to see if I could help her, and I quickly found out that she had no idea of what to do. I mentioned rocking the truck back and forth, but she didn't comprehend what I was saying. She called her dad, and the dad and a brother came to help. The dad got the truck out by rocking it back and forth. I stuck around to see if I could help push, but I wasn't needed.

The bushes and trees are all snow covered, and it looks pretty outside.Merry Christmas everyone! I hope Santa made it home safely and before the storm hit.Later:  I did get some good exercise today. The storm ended in the early afternoon, and I spent 3 or 4 hours shoveling snow. I shoveled my driveway and sidewalks and then went down the street and shoveled the driveway and sidewalks for a friend who is visiting his children in Louisiana. I didn't want him to return home in a few days with a foot of heavy snow in his driveway."},
{"title": "Up goes the distance -- to 10 miles", "date": "Wednesday, December 24, 2008", "text": "My wakeup heart rate was 53 this morning; slightly high but not bad. The temperature was 27 (F) when I left home and 29 when I returned. Rather than run the Jordan River Parkway that likely was snow covered, I ran 27th West for 5 miles out and 5 miles back.The sidewalk was snow covered, and I ran in the street because it was dry asphalt. Except for a half-mile stretch, the street has wide shoulders that were clear of snow, and I had no problems with drivers. While I was on the half-mile stretch without shoulders, I had to run along the white line marking the edge of the driving lane, and the drivers were all courteous and moved over to the center line while passing me. While going out there was a 10-12 mph head wind, but the wind died down on the way back with just occasional gusts.It was a nice day for running, and I had a great run. Ten miles will be my cap for my medium run. My next goal will be to extend my long run to 15 miles from its present 8 miles. I will, hopefully, reach 13 miles by the end of March, and if I think I have a good chance to PB the Salt Lake City half marathon in mid April, I will level off the long run at 13 miles until after the race and then continue up to 15 miles. To avoid overdoing my training, I am increasing my distance only twice per month. When I was younger I could increase my distance every week, but being older I have to make the changes less often."},
{"title": "A great 5-mile run, even with the snow", "date": "Monday, December 22, 2008", "text": "I knew a snow storm was c0ming today that would leave 3-4 inches of snow, so I got out running as early as I could. However, it started snowing just as I was leaving the house. I ran along 27th West, the city street that I've mentioned before. The sidewalks were covered with fresh snow, and about half an inch fell while I was running. Fresh snow isn't slick, and I had no problem slipping in the snow. There was a 10-15 mph headwind during the first half, but my nylon windbreaker took care of that. When I reached the turn-around point, I was nice and warm, especially since the wind was now a tailwind.In terms of how much energy it takes, running in snow is harder than running on bare sidewalks or asphalt paths. Today was supposed to be a rest run, but it became a more stressful run due to the snow. But, I enjoyed it and was glad I went out this morning. I followed my usual technique for winter running: smaller steps, a slower pace, and running flat-footed. I wanted to run this morning and again on Wednesday, so I wouldn't need to run on Thursday, Christmas day."},

By the time I reached the Jordan River Parkway it was snowing heavily, and I decided not to run on the path and went home. Later in the evening I went to the Recreational Center of my city and used a treadmill for half an hour. In 36 years of running, this was my first use of a treadmill. I found that I was taking short steps, and my pace for the same comfort level was quite a bit slower than on the roads. I expect that as I got used to the treadmill, I would take larger steps. After I left the treadmill, I ran around the 1/10 mile track that loops around the rec center. Because short tracks are hard on ones knees, due to the frequent turns at the four corners of the loop, I reversed direction every 2 or 3 loops.I found the treadmill and the indoor track were very boring, and I'm not anxious to run them very often. They are, though, a good backup for use on stormy days when it isn't wise to run outside. I enjoy running in the snow, but I don't like to run on slick paths. I do have my ice cleats from last winter, and I'll need to use them when the Parkway path or the city streets are slick."},

I went running about noontime, and the sky was sunny but still cool. I ran a comfortable pace and enjoyed being outdoors on a beautiful winter day. It felt good to get my body warmed up from running. The Jordan River Parkway path was in good shape. There were a few places with ice, but most of the path was bare asphalt.I was passed by a group of about 20 runners who were all wearing the same running clothes, and I decided they were from the Police Academy. I had already finished the 1.5 mile round trip on the new north segment of the path when the police recruits began their 5-mile PT run. They passed me as we went south and caught up with me again on the way back, and I finished a few minutes behind them (actually I finished with a few of the stragglers). I chatted for a few minutes with one of the recruits. He is from Boston, and I told him I lived back there for 17 years."},
{"title": "My feet are stiff after last night's run", "date": "Tuesday, December 16, 2008", "text": "I've mentioned before that I was born with stiff joints and stiff muscles. My condition is known as the \"squeaky door\" syndrome. Just as a door with very rusty hinges is hard to get moving but once it moves it moves more freely, my muscles are stiff when I first get up but feel better as I move around. I got up a couple of times during the night to get a drink of water, and my feet were very stiff when I walked into the bathroom. They felt better on my way back to bed. They aren't used to the 9 miles that I ran last night. After a couple of weeks of that distance, my feet will feel better. This is nothing to worry about -- just the way my body is built.This squeaky door problem is the reason I started running many years ago. I've always been active and done a lot of walking and hiking. But, after finishing college, I bought a car and began driving instead of walking as much. Over a period of a couple of years, the muscles in my feet deteriorated and starting hurting when I was on my feet a lot. After a day of yard work, while I was in Phoenix, my feet would hurt for two days. The doctor told me to do anything I wanted that would strengthen the muscles in my feet. I began running. My feet are still stiff after I'm on my feet a lot, but I no longer have the pain in my feet. I also use a homeopathic remedy called Rhus Tox when my feet are stiff. That remedy really helps a lot. It is made from diluted poison ivy."},
{"title": "It was cold, windy with snow flurries, but I had a great 9-mile run!", "date": "Monday, December 15, 2008", "text": "I didn't run until late afternoon. I knew it would be dark before I finished, and I was concerned about running in the dark on a path covered with half an inch of snow and patches of ice. I thus chose to run along a city street instead of on the Jordan River Parkway. That street  runs north-south almost the full length of the Salt Lake Valley, and I use it when it would not be wise to run on the Parkway. The street is well lit and has a lot of traffic. I don't like the smoke from vehicles, but I do like having people passing me every half-minute or so in case I slip on ice or something and need help.The temperature was 27 (F) when I left home, and there was 10-15 mph wind blowing. There were also snow flurries coming down. The temperature didn't change much during my run, and the wind had stopped by the time I reached the turnaround point. After a mile and a half, my body had warmed up, and I was actually sweating around my hat from then on.I went slow and took smaller steps so I could land on the midsole of my shoes and avoid a heel strike and a toe-off. Heel strikes on ice are a quick way to slip and fall, since the edge of the heel doesn't have much surface area in contact with the ground. I stopped and walked across all of the intersections, because they were covered with black ice and I didn't want to risk a fall. I ran between intersections. Fresh snow isn't very slick, and I was actually glad that snow flurries were occurring, because they made the path safer for running. Ice and snow packed by automobiles are slicker than fresh snow.My wakeup heart rate was 51 this morning, and I felt pretty good all day. I slept almost 9 hours last night, and I was grateful for that since I only had 4 hours of sleep Saturday night; I woke up after 4 hours and didn't go back to sleep due to stress about having to get up early Sunday morning and drive into Salt Lake City. Adding to my stress was a very busy schedule on Saturday that caused me to miss my Saturday run."},

{"title": "I had a marathon DNS in Massachusetts", "date": "Tuesday, December 09, 2008", "text": "I've been thinking about marathon DNS (Did Not Start) and thought I'd explain how my 5th marathon became a DNS.I ran two marathons in 1981 and again in 1982 (Green Mountain, Vermont in August and Foxboro in Massachusetts in October or November). I trained for and registered for Foxboro in 1983 but did not start the race due to a hectic schedule that only gave me four to five hours of sleep a night . I had been going to night school for 5 years to get another Masters degree (Computer Information Systems),  and I had been taking one class per semester; the classes had software projects that took quite a few hours outside of class. However, in the Fall of 1983 I took two classes and had to complete two projects. I was working 9 hours per day with 2 hours of commute time. I was teaching a religion class at 6 am to several high school students. My wife and I had a very large garden that needed harvesting and rototilling during the fall.  And, if all of that wasn't enough I needed to split and stack 5 cords of wood for use a year later after the wood had dried. And, I don't want to forget to mention that I was a father to four children, two of whom were teenagers, and a husband to my dear wife. Oh yes, I was training for my 5th marathon. My training for my previous marathons peaked at 45 miles per week, but for the 5th one I peaked at 50 miles per week. I held up pretty well to all of this until the morning of the marathon. I woke up that morning and felt like I had been run over by a truck. I didn't even get out of bed; I just turned over and went back to sleep.I felt bad that I hadn't run the marathon, but I knew I had done the best I could, and I had no regrets. I continued to run around 25 miles per week and enjoyed that, as I had enjoyed all of my running. I didn't train for any more marathons while I was in Massachusetts. I became interested in video and shot a lot of tapes of school board meetings, school plays, parades, vacations in Maine, birds and squirrels, the regional symphony orchestra, etc., and showed them on the local Access cable channel. I had so many things on the Access channel that my kids called it Allen Leigh's channel. One of the events that brought me a lot of pleasure was the annual Memorial Day parade, probably the highlight of the town activities. I shot the parade by running ahead of the parade, shooting some tape, running ahead again, and so on. After the parade and memorial program, I went home and quickly edited the tape and took it to the cable station. They played the tape over and over again all day, and quite a few older people who couldn't get out for the parade called in and thanked the station for showing the parade and program.I believe that our trials and difficulties happen to us for a reason. In my case, I learned that I can't do everything I would like to do and must set priorities. Races are nice, but they pass, and as I look back on the various races I've run I realize they were nice at the time, but they aren't the most important events in my life. If I had to choose between my races or my video work or my being a Scoutmaster for 12 of the 17 years I was in Massachusetts, I would choose the video work and my scouting work. Those activities influenced many people, from the performers to the spectators to the boys in my troop. Just so you won't think I'm negative about my running, I do enjoy running and think it is one the most important things I do. I run because I enjoy it. In addition, running has given me a strong body, a body that almost died four years ago from an auto accident but was strong enough due to my running to keep on living even though the doctors called in my children on two occasions because they didn't think I would make it during the night (my wife was in a different hospital at the time having her own injuries to overcome)."},
{"title": "I'm up to 9 miles!", "date": "Monday, December 08, 2008", "text": "My wakeup heart rate was 50 this morning, and I felt energetic and ready to run. However, we had snow flurries during the morning and the temperature was 34 (F). So, I decided to wait until the afternoon when it would be warmer. The afternoon came, the snow flurries continued, and the temperature went down to 32. I decided I'd better go running before the path started to ice up.Since I did a short run on Saturday, I thought I'd do my mid-week this morning and a rest run on Wednesday. I also decided, as I ran, to change my schedule. I would like to reach 10 miles by the end of the year, but I didn't want to take both my mid-week medium run and my weekend long run to 10 miles, so I decided to take my medium to 10 miles in one-mile increments, where it will be capped at that distance, and keep my long run at 8 miles. My increases will still be 1 mile, but that mile will be for one run instead of split between two runs. Then in January I'll bring my long run from 8 miles to 10 miles, giving me a weekly distance of 25 miles. I'll run that distance for a month and then take my long run up to 15 miles in one-mile increments. I should reach that distance by mid-March, and with a month to go for the Salt Lake City Half Marathon in April, I might be ready to try for a new PB in that race.So, I added a mile to my run and did 9 miles. It was a nice run, even with the snow flurries that fell during most of the run. I wore three layers and started to sweat a little bit after 2 miles."},
{"title": "This was the day for a short rest run", "date": "Saturday, December 06, 2008", "text": "I had hopes of running 8 miles, but after I'd gone half a mile I knew my run would be a short rest run. I had a busy schedule today that required that I do my run first thing, and I was on the Jordan River Parkway by 8:30 this morning. The temperature was in the mid 20s (F) during my run, but the sky was clear and we expected a nice day with a high in the 40s. I ran 2.5 miles and enjoyed the run, even though I was tired and had low energy.I went to bed early last night, but I didn't sleep very well. I ended up with about 5 hours of sleep. I frequently have a difficult time sleeping, due to nervous anxiety, when I have to get up early. When I left home this morning, it had only been 36 hours since my super run on Thursday, and I need at least 48 hours for recovery. That, plus my lack of sleep last night, set the conditions for my body to tell me it needed more rest. I'm glad that I've learned during the past 35+ years of running to listen to my body and to follow the messages I receive from my body."},
{"title": "A great 5-mile rest run", "date": "Thursday, December 04, 2008", "text": "It was dark when I left home for my 5-mile run. My wakeup heart rate was 51 this morning, and I felt fine during the day. I only took two walking/standing breaks during the five miles. The first break was for 2 or 3 minutes while I talked with a man installing a chain link fence. That was after 1 1/4 miles. At 2 1/2 miles I took a 20 second walking break due to a slight pain in my right knee (not an injury pain, just a stiff muscle pain). I started walking as soon as the pain appeared, and the pain went away as soon as I stopped running. I walked for 20 seconds or so and then ran the rest of the distance. I felt strong during the run, and enjoyed being out.I like running at night. People are gone and I have the trail all to myself. The lights in nearby buildings and distant houses glow like beacons in a dark night. The world seems peaceful, and I seem at peace with the world and with myself. I'm a night owl and have always enjoyed the nights. As a teenager I would stay up late contacting ham radio stations all over the world and would then sleep in. I still stay up late but don't sleep in as well as I used to.About a month ago, as I finished my run, I saw a truck from a fence company in the parking lot. While I was stretching in the tunnel under 9800 South, two men walked through the tunnel going South, and one of the men got in the truck and drove away. I knew then that a farmer was going to fence in his field that borders the new segment of the Jordan River Parkway.The first part of my run tonight was on the north-bound segment, and I saw new metal fence posts that had been installed along the edge of a pasture that borders the Parkway. On my way back, I saw a truck parked next to the fence posts, and a man was getting out of the truck. I commented to him, \"You're working late tonight\" (it was dark). I stopped and talked with the man for a couple of minutes. He said he had put the posts up earlier today, and that he would let the concrete harden tomorrow and then put the chain links up on Saturday or Monday. The fence will be on three sides of his pasture, and the total length of the fence will be about half a mile. A nice job for the contractor, and a big cost for the farmer. Chain link fences are ugly in a natural setting, but some of the fence will be shielded from the path by trees and bushes.The new branch of the Parkway, that I spoke of yesterday, is finished. During my run this evening I followed the path from its beginning at approximately 103rd South to its end next to the model home in a new neighborhood that is being constructed. The path is only about 1/8 mile long, but it goes by a pond and will give a nice view to those using the path. It was dark when I ran the path, and I could see a lot of black dots in the pond -- ducks and geese settled in for the night.The path isn't as wide as the main Parkway path, but it will be fine. Not many people will use it, and there is room for persons going both ways to pass. The path is about 20 or 30 feet south of the mid-point between the tunnels under 9800 South and 10600 South."},

Probably a year or more. I left home in the late afternoon and did most of the run in the dusk, but the last mile was in the dark.It took me about 4 miles to get warmed up, and during that time I took walking breaks every half-mile. However, during the last 4 miles, I felt great and only took walking breaks every 2 miles or so. On the way out I used my GPS to check my pace once in a while, and it was 12:00 to 13:00 or so. On the way back, I couldn't see the GPS very well, but it felt like I was going faster. Probably around 11:30. I have to be careful about checking my pace, because I don't want to get motivated to run faster. I'm letting my body dictate the speed.During the past few weeks, I've been focusing on finishing a family history book that I've been compiling during the past 10 years. It's called Generations of Websters, and it contains stories about my Webster ancestors down to my father's generation. I finished the book this morning, and I hope I can be more consistent in getting to bed earlier than the 1-2 am that I've been doing recently. Getting a good 7 or 7 1/2 hours of sleep really makes a difference in how I feel the next day.A few months ago I mentioned the city was putting in a new trail going from the main trail to a new residential area. The workers finished the grading, road base, and leveling phases of the trail several weeks ago, and I've been waiting for them to put the asphalt on the trail. It's so late in the year that I had decided they would wait until Spring to finish the path. However, when I passed the path today, I saw that it had asphalt, and I could see the workers, truck, roller, etc. working on the trail, about 100 yards from the main trail. I  couldn't tell if they were just starting or just finishing. It was dark when I passed the new trail on my way back, and the workers were gone. If I remember to bring my GPS during my next run, I'll check out the new path. I need the GPS because I'll be running a modified route, and I'll use the GPS to tell me when I've run 8 miles.I saw a deer while on my run. He was near the trail, and when he heard me coming, he walked down to the Jordan River and waded to the middle of the river. He then stopped and drank some water. He looked like a relatively young deer, and he presented a magnificent view while standing in the middle of the river. The water was around 15 inches in depth.This picture is from the web, rather than one I took, but it gives you a rough idea of what I saw. Click for a larger image."},

Now, I'm looking forward to two days of rest and a nice Thanksgiving time tomorrow with two of my four kids and their four children.The temperature was in the 50s (F), and it was a great day to be outdoors. I wore my long sleeved cotton T-shirt and should have worn a short sleeved shirt, because I felt too warm. However, it wasn't bad.In past posts I've mentioned a big hill in my running route. I'm almost to the point where I run the full hill. Every two weeks, when I increase my distance, I also increase by 50 yards or so the amount of the hill that I run (I then walk the remaining distance). In another month to six weeks I should be running the whole hill.On my return trip, I get good practice running down the hill.

When I was younger I had no difficulty staying up late (I'm a night owl) and sleeping in until 10 or 11, but now I wake up about an hour after sun rise regardless of how long I've slept. I really enjoy doing projects late at night, and that gets me into trouble with my sleeping.I stay in bed for 7 hours, even if I'm awake. This helps, I assume, my body adjust to being in bed longer.I take after about five hours a homeopathic remedy called Nux Vomica to help my mind settle down and quite thinking of everything. That remedy really helps. I drink two glasses of water during the night, so I'm up several times going to the bathroom, and I time my use of Nux with one of those trips.

I've slept better during the past two nights, but it takes time for ones body to recover from sleep deficits. Our bodies needs rest to recover from the stress of running, and older persons, like me, need extra rest. My wakeup heart rate this morning was 53.While I was stretching at the end of my run, a park Ranger drove up and stopped not too far from me. I assumed he was going to question me about being in the park after dark, but he didn't. He had seen a stray dog and was trying to find out who owned it. The dog had come over by me, and the Ranger asked me if I owned the dog, and I said, \"no\".When I first saw him, I was surprised that he would want to talk with me, because the park is open until 10 pm and the time when he talked with me was about 7 pm; I was a little concerned about it. The park rangers do good job of patrolling the park. I see them frequently during the week.

It caught up with me today. I knew I was in trouble when I took my first walking break after only 1/8 mile and a second walking break about 1/3 mile later. After I warmed up, though, I was able to go half a mile between breaks. As I ran, I had to make a decision about finishing the 5 miles or aborting the run. I was running, more of a jog, pretty slow, and I decided to finish the distance by taking walking breaks when I needed them.I had planned on going out earlier in the day and thus didn't eat breakfast. However, I did eat lunch and tried to take a nap (without success). I then went running in the late afternoon, and the only food I had all day was the lunch.  I think the lunch probably gave me about enough calories to compensate for those burned during my run, so I went the whole day without consuming calories for my basic bodily functions. After I returned from the run I ate a banana and drank a glass of orange juice. Not long after I ate that food, some friends came by to visit, and I was shivering while talking with them. I wrapped a wool afghan around me while we talked, and that helped. By the time they left, I felt warm, probably due to the banana and juice. In looking back on all of this, today was a real bummer. I have no one to blame but myself for messing up my sleeping schedule (staying up late and not being able to sleep after the sun comes up) and not eating much.Most of my run was after the sun had gone down but it wasn't daylight yet. The Salt Lake Valley is surrounded by high mountings, and the sun sets behind the mountains earlier than it would in flat country. I was on my way back when I say 6 or 7 flocks of geese flying north with lots of honking. They passed me and continued going north for another quarter mile. Then then turned went south and passed me again. I guess they were looking for a place to spend the night. It seemed strange that they went north and then reversed course and went south. Oh well, they know what they are doing."},
{"title": "The end of another good running week", "date": "Saturday, November 15, 2008", "text": "I ended my run with another 7.5 mile run along the Parkway. I was out earlier today, and the shade temperature when I left home was 40 (F); it was 45 when I returned. My wakeup heart this morning was 52, not quite as low as last week but still pretty good. I was a little more tired during this run and didn't go quite as fast as I did on Thursday and on last Saturday. All of my walking breaks were at 1-mile markers, except the first walking break which was at the end of an out-back on the new trail (1.5 miles).This was my second week of running 7.5 miles, and if I feel good next week, I'll do 8 miles for my mid-week and week-end runs. My rest run is always 5 miles.There were a lot of walkers, bikers, and runners on the Parkway this morning. Also, I saw quite a few police officers from the Academy. Normally when I see them, they are doing 1.5 mile qualification runs, but this morning they were just doing a training run."},

I didn't measure my pace, but I felt like I was running about the same pace that I ran on Saturday.In my previous posts going back a couple of years, I've mentioned a big hill. My runs longer than 6.5 miles take me up that hill. I'm not running all the way up, but each time I increase my distance, I also increase the amount of the hill that I run. In 3 or 4 more increases (about 100 yards per increase), and I'll be running up the whole hill. I'm getting better at running down the hill, too. A month ago my knees were weak and couldn't handle the stress of running downhill, but now I can jog down the hill at a pace of about 14 minutes."},

In fact I felt so good that I measured my pace during the last half mile at 11:24. I took walking breaks every mile, with a few brief stops in between to pick up litter.I'm considering last week as a rest week, so this week is the first of three or four weeks with, hopefully, good improvements in my body strength.

That's how I think of my run this evening. I left home after the sun had set, and by the time I finished the 1.5 miles of the new path, it was getting dark. For 5 miles I felt strong and thought I could go on forever. I did start feeling tired during the last 2 miles, but I continued my strong running and finished without the \"dragged out\" feeling that I sometimes have when I get tired. The temperature was in the low 50s (F) and high 40s during the run, and that helped me to continue a strong run. When I say strong run, I'm not saying that I was pushing myself to go faster. I'm saying that I felt strong, and that feeling continued with me to the end. I let my body set the speed it wanted to go. My wakeup heart rate was 53 this morning, a bit higher than earlier in the week.I wore one layer during the run, and my core felt fine all the time. My arms did get slightly cold toward the end of the run, no doubt due to more blood being diverted to the core as the outside temperature started to fall.Just a comment on getting a bit tired during the last two miles. I'm not running very fast, and it took me 1 hour 45 minutes to do the 7 miles, including a few stops for picking up litter and some walking breaks. I ran for 1 1/2 hours before I started to get tired, and that's pretty good for my present condition.My wife doesn't like me to run after dark, because she is worried that I might be attacked or something. The Jordan River Parkway is isolated, and there are lots of trees and bushes that border the path. I keep telling her that it is safe there, but tonight I began to wonder about that.I had finished my run and was stretching in the tunnel under 9800/10000 South. I saw a car pull up, and a big guy dressed in a black robe with a white sash around his waist got out and began looking for something by a picnic table. I thought to myself, \"I hope he isn't looking for a victim for a human sacrifice.\" Then a girl got out who was dressed in a long white robe and looked like a Greek goddess. I got really worried when the guy and girl got back in their car and drove over by me. I thought, \"Oh Oh.\" The car stopped, and the guy said, \"Have you seen any clues? We're on a scavenger hunt.\" With relief I said, \"I'm just a runner and have been running south of here.\" He said, \"OK\" and went back to the picnic tables and looked some more. Just as I was walking to my car, another car filled with Greek gods and goddesses or whatever drove up, and the people got out and began looking. So, as I keep telling my wife, it is a safe place to run after dark. Right."},

The path looks nice, has nice curves, goes through a lot of Russian Olive trees, and has nice views of the river. The path is exactly 1.5 miles round trip from the large Jordan River Parkway sign next to the parking lot. It looks like the path will get a lot of use, because I passed about a dozen people on the new path this evening.Please excuse me for changing the Christmas carol from laying to honking. I was on the return leg of my run this evening, the sun had gone done, and it was getting dark. At least 11 or 12 swarms of geese flew over me, about 200 feet above me, honking wildly. I don't know if their honking was a form of sonar to keep the geese together in the V formation while they flew in the darkness, or perhaps like the lights on airplanes to keep geese in one swarm from crashing into geese in another swarm. Several swarms of geese flew over me at the same time, and this continued for a couple of miles of my run. Whatever the reason for their honking, they were making a lot of noise, and I knew for a minute before they arrived that they were coming. But about 10-15 minutes after it was dark, the geese stopped flying over me -- apparently they were bedded down for the night.On the sixth day of Christmas my true love gave to me ... 6 geese a honking ...The following picture is from the web.

The sun was close to setting when I drove home, but it was still above the horizon and was shining in my eyes and making it hard to see while I drove. I enjoyed the run but was getting tired during the last mile. I didn't have much to eat during the day and was probably running out of energy. I had a boiled egg and two peaches for breakfast, a few pieces of candy at my mother-ion-law's house, and another boiled egg just before I left home about 3 pm for the run. Not much fuel for a day's activity and a 7-mile run....It is close to 1.43 miles round-trip on the new northward path, and I'm enjoying running that and then finishing my run going south like I've been doing for three years.My wakeup heart rate this morning was 53, but I didn't feel as energetic as I did on Monday. Probably a side-effect of only 5 hours of sleep Sunday night and insufficient food today. I had good sleep on Monday and Tuesday nights, but the effect of insufficient sleep usually hits me a couple of days later. If I get good sleep during the next three nights I should be fine on Saturday for my next run.The new path on the Jordan River Parkway that goes north from 9800 South is almost finished. The workmen have finished the two-strand barbed wire fence, and the farmer's horses were grazing peacefully in their pasture when I ran the path this afternoon. The workmen have put dirt/gravel along most of the edges of the path to fill in the 4-inch drop-off from the top of the asphalt to the ground, giving a nice slope from the asphalt to the ground. They are putting wood chips on the dirt added to the edges to give a natural looking finish to the path. The path looks very nice and is fun to run. I was told by two workmen that they aren't finishing the last hundred yards or so of the path, because the city didn't buy that land. I don't know if this was a mistake by South Jordan City or if that part of the path is actually in West Jordan City. At any rate, I expect they will be finished with their contract with South Jordan City when I do my next run on Saturday.While I was running south of 9800 South, I stopped to talk with one of the Park Rangers.

Instead, the workers are installing a long (about 1/3 mile) fence to keep horses enclosed in their pasture. The workers are also putting dirt along the edge of the asphalt to give a shoulder to the path (the asphalt was about 3-4 inches higher than the ground around it). This work on the shoulder is about one-third finished.As I was running past a fishing pond south of 106th South, a crane skimmed over the water and then as it neared me, it rose to a higher height over the water. It was a gray color, and I'm guessing it was a Sandhill crane. I say this only because I found a picture via Google of a Sandhill crane, and the bird was a gray color.

I had thought the path went all the way to the border of West Jordan City, but one of the workmen told me today that they still have about 100 yards to go. The remaining part has been dug and the black \"cloth\" laid on the ground. Also, some roadbase has been put on the cloth. They still need to add more roadbase, level and compress it, and pave it. When I talked with the workmen, they were installing a fence to keep the horses that I've mentioned in previous posts from getting into the Parkway.I noticed that next to the dam at the end of the Parkway path, water was being diverted into an irrigation canal.

This is the second week I've run 6.5 miles, and I don't know yet if I'll go for a 3rd week next week or go for 7 miles. One of the key things to know that it is time for an increase in distance is my energy level when I finish. If I'm pretty tired when I finish, I'm not ready for an increase. Since Monday is always a 5-mile rest run, my decision about an increase will be made next Wednesday.I was out earlier this morning. The shade temperature when I left was mid 70s (F). I drank 16 oz of water during the run. I also went a little faster than I've been doing, and that is a good sign that my energy level is higher. My pace during the last half-mile was 12:28.The roadbase has been laid, leveled, and compacted up to the fence at 0.37 miles. The roadbase has been laid for a few hundred feet past the fence, but it hasn't been leveled or compacted. The dirt has been removed for the path up to another fence and beyond it (I couldn't see very far past that second fence) but no roadbase has been laid in that part. I saw horses in the section past the second fence, and I'm guessing that fence might be the boundry between South Jordan City and West Jordan City. I did see some red flags west of the dirt path, implying somebody will put a fence there to keep the horses off the Parkway. Based on how much progress was made last week, it will take them another week to get the roadbase laid, leveled, and compacted up to the second fence.I saw a lot of bicycle tracks in the dirt path, indicating people are starting to use the new segment of the Parkway even though it isn't paved yet.

{"title": "Ran my 5-mile rest run today", "date": "Monday, September 22, 2008", "text": "I ran 5 miles on the Jordan River Parkway today. It was a rest run, and I ran a comfortable pace and enjoyed myself. I felt fine during and after the run.In the past I've been adding 1/2 mile per week to my mid-week and weekend runs. My goal was to get those runs up to 10 and 15 miles, respectively. My first-of-week run is capped at 5 miles as a rest run. I've been careful to listen to my body and to modify my runs accordingly, reducing the distance, skipping a run, etc. This listening to my body has been a short-term effort. Short time being the immediate future, i.e. that day.I've been discussing my injury last year with a running friend named Boscho who is also a medical doctor. He has helped me realize that in addition to focusing on the short term, I need to focus on the long term effects of my running. Long term means that I understand how my running today may affect my body days or weeks in the future. The reason this is important is that running causes stress on my body, and if I advance in distance or speed too quickly, the stress can build up over time until an injury occurs. Stress today might injury me in 2 or 3 months.Boscho thinks (and I agree with him) that this is why I was injured last fall. For six months prior to the injury I had focused on running a faster LSD pace, and my LSD pace had gone from about 11:30 to 10:15 to 10:30. After the six months, I stopped increasing my pace and immediately began to increase my distance. Think about this: I increased my pace over a six month period, and that put a lot of stress on my body. With my body under that stress I began to increase my distance while running the faster pace, and after about 2 or 3 weeks of increased distance, I was injured. What I should have done was stop increasing my pace and then run the faster pace over the distance I'd been running for enough days or weeks that my body had gotten used to it, that is, until my body had adapted to the higher stress. Then, I could start to increase my distance and have less risk because my body was used to the higher pace.So, I'm changing my training such that I will allow more time at each increase in distance before I increase again. Five years ago I trained this way. I would increase my distance and then run the new distance for 2 or 3 weeks until I felt energetic. I started to make weekly changes after my auto accident in May 2004. My body seemed strong, and I made weekly changes in distance and did OK. But, I'm older than I was 20 years ago, and I need more time to adjust to stress. My new change to my training means that instead of adding 1/2 mile each week, I will add 1/2 mile every two weeks at the minimum, and I may go three or four weeks before I increase again."},

I drank 16 oz of water during the run.The temperature during the run was in the mid 70s, and the sky was cloudy with a few sprinkles of rain.I've been discussing my injury on running.about .com with Boscho, who is both a runner of many years and a medical doctor (http://forums.about.com/n/pfx/forum.aspx?nav=messages&webtag=ab-running&tid=4400), and he is helping me have a better understanding of why I was injured.After I completed the Salt Lake City half-marathon in April 2007, I decided I wanted to have a faster LSD pace. My LSD pace at that time was about 11:30. I reduced my distance from 33 mpw to about 20 mpw and began to run a bit faster. No intervals, no fartleks, just running a bit faster. Then in October I decided that was enough of that, and I changed to increasing my distance back to 33 mpw. I was up to 7.5 miles (from 5 miles) when I was injured. Boscho has helped me realize that I should have not increased my distance for a while after leveling off in my pace, because my body probably needed more time to adjust to the higher stress of the faster pace. But, I felt good and unconsciously assumed my body was doing OK.  After about 6 weeks of increasing my distance at the faster pace, my body gave up, and I was injured.  I'm not sure how long I should have run the faster pace before I started to increase my pace, but I would guess at least two months. One thing to be learned from this is that higher stress may lead to injuries but those injuries may not occur for several months.Another factor that is involved with this discussion is how often I should make increases in distance. I've been making weekly increases, but I'm wondering if, especially at my age, I should only make increases monthly. I've asked Boscho for his opinion on this. Also, I want to look in Galloway's book on running until you're 100 to see if he says anything about the frequency of increases.On Thursday I saw that the workmen had laid road base and were compressing it with a large roller. Today, I began my run by running north on the new segment of the Parkway. The workers were not on site today, so I had freedom to run the entire path to see how the work was progressing.The compacted road base lasted for 0.19 miles. After that there was road base laid, but it wasn't leveled or compacted. I followed the path for a total distance of 0.37 miles where I was stopped by a wire gate that was closed across the path. I could look past the gate and see that the dirt had been removed, so I think the dirt has been removed all the way to the border of West Jordan City.I think that the road base and compaction phase will be completed by midweek week after next. Then a week will be needed for paving, and a week for cleanup. Thus, I'm guessing the work will be finished by mid-October. The contract deadline is the end of October.As I ran the new segment, I saw bicycle tracks in the dirt, so I wasn't the first \"user\" on the new path. I might have been, however, the first runner."},

During my run I had a higher than normal energy level. The only walking breaks I took were my scheduled ones at half-mile markers. I drank 16 oz of water and finished the run with one nice gulp left which I drank during my cool-down walk.I was glad I felt fine during the run, because I wasn't sure what condition I was in. On Tuesday after my run I started having stomach cramps. Not big cramps and not frequent cramps but cramps that caused discomfort. My energy level was also low. The cramps and low energy continued all day Wednesday, but by bedtime last night I felt better. When I got up this morning I did so with the attitude that I would abort the run if I felt tired. Rather than feeling tired, I felt great during the whole run. I measured the last half-mile as a pace of 12:01, a pace that represented the whole run.The temperature when I left home was in the low 70s, and it was a wonderful day!During my warm-up and cool-down walks, I stopped to check on the progress of the extension of the Parkway path. They apparently have dug the path up to 9400 South, and they have put down gravel and sand on the path. When I finished my run and was walking to cool down, I saw a large roller compacting the road base.The first part of the extension looks nice. There are Russian Olive trees on both sides of the path, which should give shade in the early morning and late evening. The river is just a few yards from the path, which means that there will probably be ducks on the path begging for food."},

I was late getting out, and the shade temperature was 70, still too warm for good running but much better than the summer heat of low 90s at the same time of day. I had a nice run and picked up a lot of litter. The Parkway path looks pretty clean right now. However, the next windy day will bring in more litter.I always walk about 400 feet to begin my warm up. That walk takes me to the spot where the construction is going on to extend the Parkway path northward. Three workmen were there, so I asked them when they would be finished with the new path, and they said in about a month. One of them volunteered the information that the new path would be 3000 feet long. As the crow flies, the distance is 4 city blocks or one-half mile. The extra 400 feet will be due to the curves in the path to make it a more scenic path. One workman said West Jordan City doesn't have their path down to 9400 South, so there still won't be a continuous path in that part of the Parkway."},

So, as is to be expected, I didn't have a lot of energy during my run. I had decided last week to have this week be a rest week, because I've had 3 or 4 weeks of great running, and I wanted to give my body some extra rest. The timing for this rest week was great, because my performance this morning indicates I'm quite tired. This week will be a rest week, because I'll run reduced distances and a relatively slow pace, what ever pace is comfortable for me.The sky during my run was mostly cloudy, and the temperature was in the mid 70s (F). I ran at a slow pace, stopped several times to pick up litter, and took extra walking breaks to avoid my body becoming stressed out.After I finish a run, I walk through the tunnel under 100th South to cool down. I walk about 400 or so feet. After my run today as I left the tunnel going north, I could hear heavy construction equipment, and I saw a big shovel and a small tractor moving dirt to extend the path to the West Jordan border at 9400 South. It will be nice to have that work completed so I can run north as well as south.On my way back, I saw a young white tailed deer on the Parkway path. When I first saw it, it was a few hundred feet away, and it crossed the path. As I got closer to the point where I had seen the deer, it came out from the bushes and stood next to the path and watched me. I ran for several seconds and got to about 50 feet from it before it moved. It crossed the path and ran next to the path toward me. When it passed me it was about 15 feet away. It was quite a large deer, so it wasn't a young fawn, but it didn't look like an adult deer. The deer had the white spots that I think indicate it was a young deer. The following picture was taken from a web site."},

I started my run, and as I passed the first half-mile marker, the sun peaked over the mountains. Because of my high heart rate I took it easy and just focused on the distance.

{"title": "The feelings of being a marathoner", "date": "Saturday, August 09, 2008", "text": "Dean Karnazes ran 50 marathons in 50 days. I'm posting, with permission of his publisher, an essay by Karnazes that captures the emotional feelings of being a marathoner. One caution about his comments on the pain of a marathon. Competitive runners, especially those who run 50 marathons in 50 days, do need to train hard for a marathon and will likely experience the pain that Karnazes describes. Most of us, though, are recreational runners who can reduce the intensity level of their training such that they need not feel pain during the marathon. I ran four marathons when I was in my mid 40s, and I never felt pain of any kind during or after the races. I did, however, have the emotional feelings that Karnazes describes.-----------------------------Marathon -- The Ultimate Proving GroundBy Dean Karnazes,Author of 50/50A Marathon is not about running, it is about salvation.  We spend so much of our lives doubting ourselves, thinking we're not good enough, not strong enough, not made of the right stuff.  The Marathon is an opportunity for redemption.  \"Opportunity,\" because the outcome is uncertain.  \"Opportunity,\" because it is up to you, and only you, to make it happen; only you can turn your farfetched dream into a reality.You see, there is no luck involved in finishing a marathon.  The ingredients required to tackle this formidable challenge are straightforward: commitment, sacrifice, grit, and raw determination.  Plain and simple.So you set about your preparation to ready your body for the rigors of running 26.2 miles.  You train diligently, dedicating yourself wholeheartedly to the challenge ahead, pouring everything you've got into it.  But you know the Marathon will ask for more.  In the dark recesses of you mind, a gloomy voice is saying, you can't.  You do your best to ignore this self-doubt, but the voice doesn't go away.The Marathon shakes you to the core.  It deconstructs your very essence, stripping away your protective barriers and exposing your inner soul.  At a time when you are most vulnerable, the Marathon shows no pity.  It tells that it will hurt you, that it will leave you demoralized and defeated in a lifeless heap on the side of the road.  The Marathon heckles you, saying it can't be done, not by you.  \"Ha!\" it torments you, \"In your dreams.\"However, you fight back, and continue your training and preparation with steadfast resolve.  Then, one day, you find yourself standing courageously at that starting line, nervously awaiting the gun to go off.  When it does, you put your head down and charge off into the abyss with the knowledge that you either paid your dues, or skimped along the way.  There is no lying to yourself, the Marathon sees right through excuses, shortcuts, and self-transgressions.All goes well for the initial miles.  But slowly, step by step, the pain mounts as the intensity of the endeavor amplifies beyond your expectations.  You remain resolute, knowing that you did not skimp, that you did not take shortcuts along the way, that every footstep was earned through countless days of diligent preparation.  Still, with each wearing thrust forward, that little nagging inclination of self-doubt progressively advances toward the surface of your awareness.Then, at mile twenty, the voice looms louder than ever.  It hurts so bad you want to stop.  You must stop.  But you don't stop.  This time, you ignore the voice, you tune out the naysayers who all your life have told you that you’re not good enough, not strong enough, not made of the right stuff.  This time, you listen only to the passion in your heart. This burning desire tells you to keep moving forward.  To continue putting one foot boldly in front of the other, and don't stop.  Courage comes in many forms, today you will have the courage to keep trying, to not give up, no matter how dire things become.  And dire they do become.  At the 26 mile mark, you can barley see the course ahead, your vision falters as you teeter on the edge of consciousness.Then, suddenly before you, looms the finish line.  Tears stream down your face as you cover those final few steps.  Now you are finally able to answer back to that nagging, pervasive voice with a resounding: Oh yes I can!You burst across that finish line and are forever liberated from the prison of self-doubt and limitations that have formerly held you captive.  You have learned more about yourself in the past 26.2 miles than you had known in a previous lifetime.  Now you are freed from the chains that bind.  Even if you can’t walk for a week, you have never been so free.As they carry you away from the finish line, wrapped in a flimsy mylar blanket, barely able to raise your head, you are at peace.  That daunting adversary that has haunted you for an entire lifetime is now your liberator, your fondest ally.  You have done what few will ever do -- you have done what you thought you could never do -- and it is the most glorious, unforgettable awakening ever.  You are, a Marathoner, and you will wear this distinction not on the lapel of your clothing, but in your heart, for the rest of your life.©2008 Dean KarnazesABOUT THE AUTHORDean Karnazes is the author of 50/50 and the 2005 New York Times bestseller, Ultramarathon Man, and a columnist for Men’s Health magazine.

Dean Karnazes lives in San Francisco with his family.For more information, please visit http://www.ultramarathonman.com.My body's reaction to the chemotherapy cream that I'm using for a skin cancer on my left ear is following a definite pattern. I use the cream 5 days per week, Monday night through Friday night. My wakeup heart rate has been low (typically 51 or 52) on Monday morning due to not having used the cream for two days. I've thus had good runs on Monday morning. However, during the week my wakeup heart rate increases, usually to 59 or 60, although during one week of using the cream, my heart rate increased to 75. On Saturdays, my wakeup heart rate has been about 55, and I've had to reduce the distance of my Saturday runs due to being tired.My wakeup heart rate this morning was 55, as it has been in past Saturdays, and I've decided to take a rest day rather than likely run a reduced distance. By taking a rest day, I'll hopefully be stronger for my Monday run. If my wakeup heart rate is low on Monday and I feel fine, I'll run 6.6 miles instead of my normal 5 miles."},

I measured my pace during the last half-mile at 13 minutes. A slow pace, but fine for a rest run in the heat. I drank about 24 ounces of water during the run.When I arrived at the parking lot at the Jordan River Parkway this morning, I saw two guys launching a RC dirigible. The airship was about 20 feet long and probably 3-4 feet in diameter. It was propelled by an electric motor in the tail of the airship. There was no gondola on the bottom of the body. It flew for about 5 minutes and then did a nose dive into the ground behind some trees. I didn't see the impact, but the crash made a lot of noise.The crash didn't seem to damage the airship, because the two guys retrieved the ship, put more helium into it, and then launched it again. It flew for about 20 minutes. I was curious how they were going to land it. For the landing, the airship did a slow dive towards the ground. Just before the airship hit the ground, the assistant pilot grabbed the nose and stopped the descent of the ship. The other guy took the tail, and they carried the ship to their truck.A few weeks ago, I saw a guy flying a RC jet F15 or something. The plane had a real jet engine, and it went pretty fast."},
{"title": "Take the Road to Fitness, and Stay the Course", "date": "Sunday, August 03, 2008", "text": "Heather Johnson is a success story of exercising for fitness and enjoyment. She tells her story.------------------------------------I took the fitness route a little late in life; although I did play basketball and just about every other sport all through school and college, it was more on a casual basis and not in an effort to increase my stamina or get healthy. The last thing on your mind as a teenager is the drive to play a sport as a form of exercise or to get fit. It’s when you reach your late 20s and begin to see the gradual changes around your hips and thighs, when friends teasingly comment on how round and chubby your face looks these days, when you see a stranger looking at you from the mirror, when the button on your jeans refuses to shake hands with the fastener on the other side, and when the bathroom scales groan even as you walk past them, that you realize you must do something drastic to regain the figure you carried all those years ago.And so I looked around for the best ways to lose weight; I tried dieting, but that didn’t seem to last long – it’s extremely hard to gulp down bread and soup when those around you are gorging on delicious food with nary a care in the world. For a while you tell yourself that it’s ok if you’re a little plump, and forget your resolution to lose weight. But when you huff and puff to climb the stairs to bed every night, the nightmares of looking like an elephant wake you up at 5 am and you hit the roads for a jog. Things were on track for a day or two, after which the toll of waking up before it’s daylight and the aches and pains in your legs lull you to shut off the alarm and turn over to go back into the land of slumber.I realized I needed a plan, one that would enable me to stick to my resolution to lose weight, come hell or high water. I looked around for a sport I could play and found a squash club on my way to work. Not satisfied with my daily hour of the game, I cajoled a friend into joining me during my morning jog. The power of two was definitely greater than one, as each of us motivated the other and had bets going on who was going to register the first 5 lbs loss. I also invested in an exercise bike and combined my TV times with at least 10 miles of cycling.The biggest motivator of course was the reading on the scales – when I saw that I had lost a couple of pounds more than my target, I cut down on my calorie intake in an effort to expedite the reduction process. I started eating just fruits and salads for dinner. I did reap the rewards of my labor a year later when I found that I lost around 40 lbs. Changes in my life did not allow me the freedom of devoting more than an hour to exercise every day, but the new me balked at going back to the pudgy person I had been a year ago. I had to decide which of my activities I wanted to keep and which I had to sacrifice. It was a tough choice, but I went with squash and gave up the rest.When someone asks me how I stayed motivated all year long, I have only this to say:- Choose something you love – I enjoyed squash the most, which is why I chose to retain it as a part of my life.- Vary your routine so that it does not get monotonous – I had more than one activity going simultaneously, so if I got bored with one, I would just spend more time at the other.- Don’t give up until you start to see a change in the way you look and feel – once you reach this stage, you’ll never look back.- Get someone to exercise with you – it’s harder to stop when you know someone else is dependent on you. Go ahead then and exercise; it’s never too late to start, and always too soon to quit before you’ve seen results.By-line:This post was contributed by Heather Johnson, who writes on the subject of EKG Technician.

The shade temperature was in the mid 70s (F) when I left home and in the mid 80s when I returned. Right now the shade temperature is 97.My wakeup heart rate was 55. It appears that my body is going through the same reaction to the chemotherapy cream that I had last week. Today is day 3 of the 5 days of treatment for this week. I felt pretty good this morning when I first got up, but as I ran I could tell I was getting tired, and at the 2 mile mark I felt about the same \"tiredness\" that I felt last Thursday at the 1 1/4 mile mark. I thus turned around and headed back. Before I left home, I filled four 8-ounce bottles with water, but I forgot to take them. I thus ran the four miles with no water. However, thanks to the cooler temperature, I didn't need water as much, and I think the two glasses of water that I drank before I left home was enough. This week I was out earlier and ran in cooler temperatures, while last week I had been on my feet for two hours in the morning at the Pioneer Days parade in Salt Lake City. So, I'm not surprised that I ran farther this week.I just woke up from an hour nap, and I feel more tired than when I went to bed an hour ago. I'll see how I feel tonight and tomorrow."},

I felt fine, however, during my stretches (especially the sit ups), and I decided to head for the Parkway. I drank 32 ounces of water during the run. I could tell I was stronger than I've been for a couple of weeks, because I took fewer walking breaks and ran at what felt like a faster pace. Well, I took fewer walking breaks on the way out, but I took quite a few on the way back, because the heat was getting to me and I didn't want to push too hard in this heat. All in all, it was a nice run.I was late getting out. It was 90 (F) when I left home and in the mid 90s when I returned. It's really dumb to run in this heat. By getting out three hours earlier, I could have run in the mid 70s. Seems like I never learn to leave home earlier.Just as I got out of my car to run, I saw two Park Rangers (employees of South Jordan City) walking from their car to the tunnel under 100th South. I asked them about the status of the project to extend the Parkway four blocks north to the boundary of West Jordan City at 94th South. They said the project has gone out to bid, and the city is waiting for the bids to come in. The deadline for bids is September 1. I hope the work can begin in September and be finished by winter. I know the path goes south from 90th South, and I hope WJ has it in to their boundary. If so, then the four blocks in the new project would connect with WJ and make the path continuous to Bluffdale at 146th South.Last week I was really tired and aborted one run and skipped the following run. My theory is that the chemotherapy cream I'm using for a skin cancer sapped my energy. In this post, I'm giving the pattern I observed last week relative to my use of the cream so I can see if that pattern emerges again this week.I'm applying the cream 5-days per week. Here is what happened last week.- Had high energy during the two days without using the cream from the week before and had a nice run to start the week.- After three days of using the cream, my energy level was low, and I aborted my run. I also spent two-hours in the sun before going on my run. I took a nap before I left for the run.- After five days of using the cream, my wake up pulse rate was up 50%, and I was so tired I didn't run at all.- Had high energy during the next two days (not using the cream) and had a nice run at the end of the two days but before I began using the cream for this week."},

It might have been an effect of the skin-cancer surgery that I had 10 days ago, or it could have been a reaction to the chemotherapy cream that I'm putting on my ear for another skin cancer. I was tired on Thursday and aborted my run, and my condition today could have been a continuation of the conditions that caused me to be tired on Thursday.I'm only applying the chemotherapy cream 5 days per week (Monday - Friday). If the cream is having a negative effect on my body, I might see an improvement on the weekends and then a degradation  during the week. I'll be monitoring my body during the weeks to come to see if there is a pattern to my being tired that correlates with my use of the cream. I have five more weeks for the cream. If the cream doesn't remove the skin cancer, I'll have to have the cancer surgically removed."},

July 24 is the anniversary of the entry into the Salt Lake valley of the Mormon pioneers under Brigham Young in 1847. There was a very large parade in Salt Lake City that lasted for two hours. My wife and I (two cars) took our four grandchildren who have been staying with us into SLC to see the parade. I had the two boys in my car and she had the two girls. Utah requires car seats up to 10 or 11, so we needed two cars to get the three car seats in the back seat. The boys and I had to walk a mile each way from the car to the beginning of the parade. That plus the time watching the parade meant that I was on my feet most of the morning. The temperature in the sun was 94 (F), and it was more humid than normal. After I got home, I was tired and took a half-hour nap.I went running just after the sun went down and the temperature had dropped into the low 80s, but I could tell I had little energy.

I ran at a pace of 11:50 the half-mile that I use to time myself. That pace was typical of my whole run.I'm glad I took a rest day on Saturday. Today was payoff-day for that extra rest. If I had run on Saturday I wouldn't have done well, would have done a lot of walking, and would have put more stress on my body. Because of the extra rest, my body felt great and performed well today,  taking only a few short walking breaks. Because of the lower temperature, I carried no water and did ok from that viewpoint.My wife and I took a walk tonight with our four grand children who are visiting with us. We walked along the canal road that I used to run a few years ago. We saw three sets of ducks and a total of 10 ducklings in the water.The last group of ducks were black ducks. The adult accompanying the ducklings was totally black except for a large white spot on its neck and breast. It's head and beak were totally black. Because the duck and its ducklings were in the water, I couldn't see if their feet were webbed or not. There were 5 ducklings, and about half were totally black with the white spot, and the rest were totally black including the neck and breast. Usually with birds, the males are more colorful, and I would expect the ducks with the white spots to be males. However, it seems unusual that a male duck would be baby-sitting the ducklings. So, I'm not sure which sex has the white spot.7/27/2008 Finally got some pictures of the black ducks. These ducks are the \"ducklings\". Some of them have the white spot, and some don't.

I was surprised that there were several cyclists, skaters, walkers, and runners on the path. I thought that sane people would be hiding from the heat. Maybe the cyclists and other persons I saw this morning are as insane as I am :) I took 32 oz of water and used 24 oz of it. That was about the right amount of water for a day like today. I had about 4 oz left in one bottle when I finished, and I drank that while I was walking back and forth in the tunnel under 100th South to cool off. I like that tunnel because it gives a lot of shade for my cool-down and stretches at the end of my run. I didn't break any speed records today, just plodded along and took frequent walking breaks and drinks of water. My purpose today was to continue getting used to my increase in distance with no concern for how fast or slow I ran.I checked my running cadence during the run, and it was 180. That is good because it means that even with the heat, I had quick leg movement; I just took smaller steps.I mentioned a few weeks ago that I was going to start running tangents during my training runs so doing that would be a habit causing me to run tangents during races without thinking about it. I've pretty much achieved that habit. In fact, on July 24 my wife and I took her 91-year old mother up to two of the Utah ski resorts for a picnic and a tram ride to the top of Hidden Mountain, elevation 11,000 feet. The canyon road has a lot of turns, and I noticed on the way down that I had a tendency to want to drive tangents. Of course, I didn't do that due to oncoming traffic, but I did catch myself a couple of times wanting to drive tangent to the curves."},

My mile splits were 10:40, 11:26, and 11:15. I started with a pace of about 10:10, and I slowed down as the race progressed. At the beginning of mile 2 there was a half mile of slight hills, and that accounts for my slower pace during that mile. I only took one 30-second walking break, after the hills in the second mile. As I slowed down, a lady who was probably in her late 40s caught up with me. She said her goal in the race was to keep up with me. We chatted during the last half mile, and when we made the turn into the last 200 yards, I told her to give it all she had. She pulled ahead of me, and I followed her over the finish line.I think I did well, considering my circumstances. I was in bed for 6 hours last night, but I only slept off and on for an hour. This happens when ever I have something important the next morning. I usually get 3 or 4 hours sleep when I'm suffering from anxiety, and I think last night was the worst case of anxiety that I've had. The good news about my sleep is that I've been sleeping well during the past couple of weeks, and my wakeup heart rate this morning was still 52. Disruptions in my sleep usually don't affect my wakeup heart rate for a couple of days, and I'm expecting my HR to jump up to the high 50s tomorrow or Monday. The other reason why I feel good about my performance is that I haven't done a lot of fast running during the Spring. I'm currently running 4 miles three days per week, and my fastest time during the past three weeks of light speed training was a half-mile timed run of 10 minutes and a few seconds. During that three weeks I had a couple of half-mile timed runs in the 11s, and the rest were in the 12s or 13s. So, my performance in this race was in line with my training. I mentioned in this blog last week that I had decided to not run the race, but I felt good this week, and I decided to go for it. I'm glad I ran this morning.The weather was almost perfect for the race. The race started at 6:30, and the temperature at that time was in the low 60s (F).

My plan was to run a mile to warm up and then do a few cadence drills, but my energy level was so low it was as if I never warmed up. The result was that I did no drills. I had a good run on Monday and ran about a minute per mile faster, and apparently one day of rest wasn't enough. Today I did jog the 4 miles but with a lot of walking.  My next run is planned for Friday and if I feel fine, I'll do a few cadence drills followed by a few fartleks. If I still feel tired, I'll abort the run.One thing that may have contributed a little bit to my tiredness was that I wore my thick, long sleeved cotton T-shirt. When I first got up, it looked cloudy and cold outside. Later, when I dressed for running I put on the thick shirt. After I started running I realized I should have worn a thin, summer shirt."},

At the 1.5 mile marker, I could tell the rain was slowing down, and by 2 miles, the rain had stopped. The temperature was in the low 50s (F).For the first mile I ran a slow pace, 13-14, to warm up. During the next mile I ran two half-mile segments at a faster pace, with a short walking break between them for recovery. In both cases, at the beginning I ran at a 11:30 pace, but by the end of the half mile I had slowed to about 11:45 to 11:50. For the next 1.5 miles I ran a comfortable recovery pace, and during the last half-mile I ran a faster pace so I could time myself. However, at the end, my stop watch still showed 000000. I thought I had started the watch, but I apparently pressed the wrong button, and the watch hadn't started.My goal today was to run 11:30 for some distance and then if I couldn't keep that pace, to keep a pace under 12 if possible. I did meet that goal. If I'm to run the 5K on June 21, I need to decrease my pace from 12:30 to 9:30. When I do a test run on the race course the week before the race, I need to do it with a 10 minute average pace for the course. If I can do the test run with a 10 minute pace, I hope the excitement and Adrenalin rush of the race will help me do a 9:30 pace for a new PB.Today I just attempted a faster pace around 11:30. On Wednesday I'll work on that pace and mix in 4 or 5 cadence drills. On Friday I'll polish the 11:30 pace and mix in some fartleks (Saturday will be a busy day, so I'll run on Friday). Next week my goal will be to do the same thing with a 10:30 pace. During the 3rd week I'll do the same with a 9:30 goal."},
{"title": "My wakeup heart rate was OK this morning", "date": "Sunday, May 25, 2008", "text": "I commented yesterday that I didn't have a lot of energy and had a sluggish run until the last half mile. Another factor that could have contributed to that feeling was lack of sleep. During the past couple of weeks I've been getting about 6 hours of sleep when I need about 7 hours. However, I only had about 5 hours of sleep during Friday night. One of the common results of lack of sleep is an increase in ones wakeup heart rate and a general feeling of diminished energy. I've been forgetting to measure my morning wakeup heart rate, so I don't know if my body was tired when I first got up Saturday morning. I did measure my wakeup heart rate this morning, and it was 52, about 4% above my normal of 50 (I had about 6 1/4 hours of sleep last night). It is likely that my wakeup heart rate would have been close to 52 or 53 yesterday morning, and this means it is unlikely that a tired body was the main contributor to my sluggishness yesterday. I think that my not eating breakfast was likely the main problem (I ran about 1:30 pm). The burst of energy I had during the last half mile was probably from the energy bar I ate about 1 1/2 hours earlier."},

During 3.5 of the miles I didn't have much energy, and I moped along at a 13-13:30 pace. However, during the last half mile, I felt energetic, and I timed the last half mile at a 12:06 pace. I don't know if my burst of energy was due to finally getting warmed up or to energy from an energy bar that I ate as I was driving to the Parkway or to Adrenalin from my timing of that segment of the run. What ever the reason, it was a nice way to end the week.I made one serious mistake this morning. When I got up, I planned on running as soon as I could get out. However, I decided to run later in the morning so I could house clean a bit before I left. My wife has been gone for a couple of days helping our daughter with her kids (her husband is out of town), and I wanted the house to look nice when she returned. The house wasn't in bad shape, but I had a few dishes to do and the floor to vacuum. I wasn't sure exactly when she would arrive, and I didn't want to take the chance that she might come before I finished my cleaning. As soon as I decided to delay my running, I should have eaten breakfast. But, I didn't do that, the result being that when I ran, I had had no food since last evening except for a few handfuls of dry cereal and the energy bar that I ate while driving. The result of this was likely a low energy level, and that was probably the major factor in my sluggishness during my run.  I've made this same mistake on quite a few occasions, and it is a dumb thing to do. Seems like I never learn.... My wife and two grand kids arrived about 5 minutes after I returned from running, so it all worked out well."},

It was a nice run. I didn't have quite the energy-level that I had on Monday, but I felt pretty good. My pace for the last half mile was 12:36. I think I've mentioned before that I try to maintain the same pace during the half-mile that I was doing for the rest of the run, so my measured pace will be representative of the whole run.I talked with a Park Ranger for a few minutes. I've seen them in their patrol cars on the Parkway, and I wanted to find out if they worked for the State, the County, or the city. I asked the ranger about city plans to extend the parkway north to the West Jordan boundary, and he said the project will go out for bids within a month. So, work might begin in late summer or early fall."},

The shade temperature was 75 (F) in the shade when I left home, and I enjoyed the relatively cool feeling of a 9 am run. My body felt strong, both legs felt fine, and I felt like a young 40-year-old. However, I started to feel the heat on the way back (the shade temperature was 85 when I arrived home). As I mentioned in my last post, most of my run was in the direct sun, although I had a bit more shade than on Saturday due to being out earlier. My pace during the last half-mile was 12:30, a bit faster than on Saturday as well as a significantly longer run.I didn't carry water today because I was out earlier and the temperature wasn't an extreme value. I drank quite a lot of water before I left home.If all goes well this week, I'll level off my distance at 4 miles and focus on speed. For next week, I'm thinking of using my Monday run to just run a faster LSD pace. My Wednesday run will be a mixture of the faster LSD pace and seven or eight cadence drills. On Saturday, I'll run seven or eight fartleks of various lengths and speeds combined with the faster LSD pace. I'll be using my last half-mile as the judge of how well I'm doing, along with my pace as measured by my GPS.On my way back I passed a pack of guys from the police departments around northern Utah. When I got to the end of my run, there were quite a few people mingling around the start of their \"race\" waiting for the guys to return. When I finished everyone cheered and the timing official shouted 8:30. Yeah, right, doing 1 1/2 miles in 8:30 is slow for me :) The policeman who came in first finished in 9 something. I talked with one guy who lives in Logan (the city where I went to college) and works for the Cache County Sheriff Department."},

The only shade I encountered was a small bit at my turn-around and complete shade for about 100 feet in the tunnel under 106th South. Running at 12:30 pm didn't help either. Monday is supposed to be 15 degrees hotter, and I'd better go out in the early morning. I'll take water too. Even though the run is short, with high temperatures I'll need extra water. My run this week was about half an hour, but next week I'll be out close to an hour, and I'll definitely need to drink water during my run.I mowed my lawn last evening so I wouldn't have to do it today after my run. I will be spraying dandelions, though, and fertilizing the lawn. I'll be doing more walking than I did yesterday while mowing the lawn.My leg felt fine during the run and still feels fine. Still a bit tight around the knee but no pain or soreness. I'm hoping to do 4 miles per run next week. I plan on leveling off my distance at 4 miles for the next month so I can focus on getting my speed up. I measured the last half-mile in my run today at a pace of 12:44. Slower than on Wednesday of this week, but not bad considering the heat. I measured my cadence during the run, and it was 172. My normal cadence is 180-185, but 172 is good for the heat. One of the reasons I don't listen to music while I run is that I don't have any music with a cadence as fast as my running cadence. Even a fast Sousa march is down in the 140s. Normal military marching is 120. I was thinking while out running today, that it would be nice to have a MP3 player that would let me change the playback speed. By ignoring samples in the digital data, the player could play the music at a faster cadence without raising the pitch."},

Otherwise, I go right back to sleep.However, after the accident my sleep pattern changed. I would wake up every hour with an intense desire for water and because of all that drinking, bathroom calls.

I ran around the block from where I live, and so far, my leg feels fine. However, my leg usually feels fine after a run,and it's the next day when the soreness comes in. So, I'll see how I feel tomorrow.It's been 18 days since I decided to take a break from running to give my right leg extra help in recovering from an injury that occurred last November. My leg is feeling pretty good. It isn't completely healed yet, but it has improved during the 18 days.Two of the conditions that I monitor to gage how well my leg is recovering are if I can kneel without pain and if I can stretch my quads by grasping my right ankle and pulling my leg up next to my buttock. When the accident occurred, I couldn't do either one, and during the almost 5 months since the accident, I've progressed so I can now kneel, and I can pull my leg closer to my buttock. I can't pull my leg quite as far as I can with the other leg, but it is getting better. During past weeks, I've had to grasp my pant leg or my stocking to pull my leg, but this morning I actually grasped my leg and pulled it. A few weeks ago when I was running three 5-mile runs each week I reached the point where I could kneel without pain. Then I started to increase my distance, and I started to feel pain when I knelt. So, my 18 days without running has helped me recover from the effects of increasing my distance.On Saturday afternoon my wife and I went to a home-repair show and spent about two hours viewing the exhibits. By the end of the tour, my right leg was starting to be sore, and I was hobbling around the house and at church yesterday (Sunday). The leg feels much better today.  Two hours of walking at the show had about the same effect on my leg as two hours of running.-"},
{"title": "Running and brain activity", "date": "Monday, April 28, 2008", "text": "I've mentioned in previous posts that I'm syncing my arm movement with my legs. When my left foot goes forward, my right arm goes forward. And likewise with the other leg and arm. I was thinking about this during a recent run, and I realized there is an important benefit from moving my legs and arms this way.In explaining this, I'm going to refer to a theory of brain activity that was popular a decade or so ago. I don't know if this theory is still in vogue, but I like the theory because it is easy to understand. So, here goes.When I move my left arm or left leg, that movement is controlled by the right side of my brain. When I move my right arm or right leg that movement is controlled by the left side of my brain. This means that when I run, because I'm syncing my arms and legs together both sides of my brain are active at the same time, rather than alternating being active as would be the case if my left arm and left leg went forward at the same time.The conclusion that I draw about this is that I'm getting twice the brain activity because I'm syncing my left foot and my right arm."},

Everything wears out eventually. Speeding up your heart will not make you live longer; that's like saying you can extend the life of your car by driving it faster. Want to live longer? Take a nap.Q: Should I cut down on meat and eat more fruits and vegetables?A: You must grasp logistical efficiencies. What does a cow eat? Hay and corn. And what are these? Vegetables. So a steak is nothing more than an efficient mechanism of delivering vegetables to your system. Need grain? Eat chicken. Beef is also a good source of field grass (green leafy vegetable). And a pork chop can give you 100% of your recommended daily allowance of vegetable products.Q: Should I reduce my alcohol intake?A: No, not at all. Wine is made from fruit. Brandy is distilled wine, that means they take the water out of the fruity bit so you get even more of the goodness that way. Beer is also made out of grain. Bottoms up!Q: How can I calculate my body/fat ratio?A: Well, if you have a body and you have fat, your ratio is one to one. If you have two bodies, your ratio is two to one, etc.Q: What are some of the advantages of participating in a regular exercise program?A: Can't think of a single one, sorry. My philosophy is: No Pain...Good!Q: Aren't fried foods bad for you?A: YOU'RE NOT LISTENING!!!... Foods are fried these days in vegetable oil. In fact, they're permeated in it. How could getting more vegetables be bad for you?Q: Will sit-ups help prevent me from getting a little soft around the middle?A: Definitely not! When you exercise a muscle, it gets bigger. You should only be doing sit-ups if you want a bigger stomach.Q: Is chocolate bad for me?A: Are you crazy? HELLO . Cocoa beans! Another vegetable!!! It's the best feel-good food around!Q: Is swimming good for your figure?A: If swimming is good for your figure, explain whales to me.Q: Is getting in-shape important for my lifestyle?A: Hey! 'Round' is a shape!Well, I hope this has cleared up any misconceptions you may have had about food and diets.And remember:\"Life should NOT be a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in an attractive and well preserved body, but rather to skid in sideways  a coke in one hand - chocolate in the other - body totally worn out and screaming, Whoo what a ride!\""},

I reduced my running from 4 days per week to 3 days per week and my mileage from 33 miles per week to 15 miles per week. Running that reduced mileage didn't seem to make the injury worse. I monitored my leg and knee every day to see if the symptoms became worse. The symptoms didn't become worse, so I continued running. In fact, during the next 2-3 months, I could see definite ways that my leg was improving.  Things looked pretty good during my weeks of running 15 miles per week. However, when I started to increase my mileage from 15 miles per week to higher distances that ended up being 25 miles per week, I could tell the soreness in my leg was becoming worse.So, I have to decide if I should cut back to 15 miles per week, or stop running for a few weeks. I've decided to stop running for a month to let my leg heal, and I will reevaluate what to do at the end of the month. During the coming month, I will do upper body workouts and use my cycling machine to help keep my body toned up. The cycling machine is the pedal part of a stationary bike but no seat or handlebars. I sit in a comfortable chair and peddle away. An indicator tells me my pedal speed, the \"distance\" I've \"traveled\" and the number of calories I've used.

I've noticed that during my longer runs my right leg is starting to hurt while I run, and my leg is sore for about 24-48 hours after the run.One problem that I've had as long as I can remember, I was probably born with it, is that when I sit down my muscles become stiff, and it takes about a minute of walking for the muscles to relax. During that minute, my right leg is sore, more now than a few weeks ago due to my running longer distances, and the leg feels fine after the muscles loosen up. Fine, that is, until I do another long run. As I mentioned above, the leg is sore during that run but feels fine after a day or two of rest.I now realize that my leg is suffering from the longer distance that I've been doing during the past month, and I've decided to reduce my distance and run a shorter distance for a few weeks to let my leg heal. I thus didn't run today to give my leg some rest. I did walk about 1 1/4 mile round-trip to a church meeting, and my leg felt fine. During the coming week, I will try 5, 6, 7 miles for my three runs.

I should have worn long pants and a heaver T-shirt :(I didn't have a lot of energy during the run. I ate an eGel at the half-way point, and I drank a lot of water during the run. After eating the gel, I felt stronger for a few minutes, but then I got tired and my pace slowed down to 15-16 minutes (going out, my pace was in the 14 minutes). This whole week has been one of low body energy. After I recovered from the flu, I should have taken a week or two to slowly work back into my distance. Instead, I jumped right in and increased my weekly mileage to two miles more than it was before I got the flu. I knew that I was taking a risk that my body might not be ready for that much stress, but I felt fine after the first week. This week, however, has shown that my body wasn't ready. So, next week will be a recovery week. Maybe a week of no running. Maybe a week of reduced running."},

The daytime temperatures, though, will get up in the mid 40s, and the snow will melt. We've had a strange spring with lots of 1-2 inch storms that melt during the day. The good news is that we're getting more snow in the mountains, and that will help fill the reservoirs that supply the water for our cities. The bad news is that if the mountain snow melts too fast, we'll have flooding."},

My body felt pretty good (more energy than on Monday but not as much as a week ago), but my legs, especially my right leg, became tired. I'm still running pretty slow, but I went a bit faster than on Monday (I let my body determine my pace).I ate some sports beans as a test. I ate half the package at my 4.5 mile turn-around point, and the rest at my 6.5 mile point. It's hard to be objective about the effect of the beans, but they didn't interfere with my running. I drank about four ounces of water after eating the beans. As I commented above, I did have a pretty good energy level during the run. My Fuel Belt has a pouch for carrying things, and it was convenient to keep the beans in there until I needed them.The temperature was in the mid 50s (F), and the sky was cloudy during the first part of the run but sunny during the last part.

The temperature was in the low 70s (F), and it was a beautiful spring day. It was warm enough that I could have used some extra water even though I only went 5 miles.After I had gone about a mile, I saw a large quantity of smoke ahead of me. As I approached the burning brush, I saw fire trucks and firemen at the scene of the fire. They were from the Utah Forest Service and were doing a controlled burn of brush along the river bank. A pumper truck was parked next to a pond not far from the fire and was pumping water for use in controlling the burn. The flames were 10-15 feet high in places and were spectacular. The fire was about 200 yards from the Parkway path."},
{"title": "A nice but even slower and tired 9 miles", "date": "Friday, March 21, 2008", "text": "I ran 9 miles today on the Jordan River Parkway. I usually would run on Saturday, but we're having 11 people to Easter dinner tomorrow, and I want to be available tomorrow to help with the preparations.I could tell when I started my run that my energy level was lower than it was during my two previous runs this week. My low energy is probably normal, considering I didn't run for two weeks due to having the flu plus allowing a few days for extra rest after I recovered from the flu, and considering that I then jumped right into running and increased my distance by a mile from what it was just before I got the flu. Because of having low energy, I ran slower than I did on Wednesday (my last half mile was a 16:38 pace), and I just focused on getting the miles in. Because of running today, I'll have two rest days before I run again on Monday, and it will be interesting to see how well my energy level improves during those two days.The temperature today was in the mid 50s (F). I carried two 8-ounce bottles of water and could have used a third bottle. In addition to carrying more water next week for my two long runs, I think I'll carry a gel or maybe try the sports beans I bought a couple of months ago.Last spring I reported that the Jordan River had washed out a section of the Parkway trail in Riverton City, and that Riverton had put in a temporary bypass around the damage. Today, my run was finally long enough that I reached the damaged area and was able to see the improvements made by the city. The damaged area has been repaired, and rocks have been placed along the edge of the river to reduce the erosion. Several truck loads of wood chips have been placed along the bank of the river and will, I assume, be spread to cover the bank.The temporary path has been graded and covered with road-base, and I assume it will be paved and made the permanent path. Also, Riverton City has put in two playgrounds (including tables) -- one on each side of the bridge that crosses the river next to the large pavilion that has been next to the river for more years than I've been running on the Parkway."},

Except for the last mile, my legs felt fine and seemed to handle the run ok. I didn't measure my wakeup HR, but I did measure it (56) shortly before I left for my run.I picked quite a few pieces of litter while I ran. I'm slowly getting the Parkway cleaned up.For the past 3-4 weeks, there has been water in the Parkway tunnel under 106th South.The water along the west edge of the tunnel was only about half an inch deep, and I was able to walk through it without getting my stockings wet.On the return trip of my run today, when I entered the tunnel, I saw two workmen checking out the electrical box that controls the pump. They were from the County, and they said the box was ok and that someone would be here in the morning to replace the pump. It will be nice to get the pump working, so we can use the tunnel during the spring runoff of the river. Last spring, the tunnel was unusable for about two months due to high water in the tunnel from the river. The water that is there now is just runoff from the rain and snow we've been having."},

On Thursday I developed a frequent cough that brought up phlegm, and I developed a 3-degree temperature. During the 5 days, I had the 3-degree temperature increase for one day and 2 degrees for several days. By the time Sunday arrived, I was feeling better but still had a temperature increase of 1 degree and still lacked energy. On Tuesday of this week, my temperature was finally back to normal, and I had a pretty good energy level. I felt fine yesterday and spent some time outside doing a minor repair on my house. I still, though, have a slight, infrequent coughI'm not running until Monday, because I'm giving my right leg extra rest.

It was almost dark, and I could just barely see them.The path was completely dry, except for some water in the tunnel under 106th South. I timed my pace during the last half mile at 11:10.When I started my run this evening, I didn't think about my arm-movement. After about 1/3 mile I remembered I was supposed to be moving my arms. I checked to see what my arms were doing, and guess what? They were right in sync with my legs. So, the habit has been formed.I've been having problems keeping my arm movement in sync with my legs during walking breaks. While running, I keep my arms bent at approximately 90 degrees. During my walking breaks, I've been letting my arms hang down to give them a rest. I realized that with my arms hanging down, they were like a longer pendulum and had a slower movement. If I keep my arms bent at the 90 degree angle, I have no problems keeping them in sync with my legs while walking.Another thing that helps keep my arms in sync is to pump them with a slight circular rotation rather than straight out and in. I imagine that I'm grabbing the path and pulling myself faster on the path."},

The good news was that the air and ground temperatures were above freezing, and the snow melted as soon as it hit the ground. I thus had no problems with traction on the path. I noticed during my last mile that the snow was collecting on the grass/dirt next to the path, and I noticed during my last half mile that it was starting to collect on the path. The path was slushy but not slick during that half-mile. When I got home, the air temperature was 32 (F).  During the run, there was a 3-5 mph wind, a tailwind on the way out and a headwind on the way back.

I was wearing three layers on my main body, including a thick, long sleeved cotton T-shirt, and all of my clothing was wet. However, thanks to my body heat I felt fine during the run and just noticed that my legs were getting slightly cold during the last couple of miles.As soon as I got home, I took a hot shower, dressed, and put on a down vest. However, I started shivering uncontrollably, the first state of Hypothermia. I ate supper, and as soon as I started eating I stopped shivering and felt fine. During the run I burned close to 1000 calories. The only food I had had during the day was whole wheat pancakes for breakfast and a couple of cheese sandwiches during the afternoon for lunch. I felt fine during the run and had a pretty good energy level. However, the loss of 1000 calories was enough to cause my core temperature to dip below 95 (F), and the shivering began. My normal temperature is 96-97 (F), so it didn't take much loss of heat to put me into the shivering stage.Assuming that I feel fine during the coming week, I'll add a mile on Wednesday and a mile on Saturday (actually Friday this week), giving me a 5, 8, 9 week."},

My right leg started getting tired towards the end of the run, and I finished the last mile with a jog/walk.During the winter there were hundreds of ducks and geese wintering on the Jordan River. They were anxious for a food handout from people visiting the river. With the warmer weather we're having, some of the ducks and geese are leaving the river and heading to their summer homes. There are, however, many birds still at the river.When I reached the river today for my run, I saw a father and his children feeding bread to the ducks.

The city had plowed the snow that came last night from the path, and the warm temperatures today [a high of 46  (F) ] had dried the path.I added a mile to my mid-week run, and I ran a comfortable LSD pace. I felt pretty good and had a relatively high energy level, considering I had spent three hours this morning shoveling snow from my driveway and sidewalks. I ran a pace of 12:30 - 13 minutes for most of the run. Mile 5 and 6 were at a slower pace of 13:30 - 14 minutes.If I'm able to continue adding a mile to my mid-week run and a mile to my weekend run, I will have met my current goal by the end of March to return to my \"normal\" distances of 5 miles rest run, 10 miles medium run, and 13 miles long run. If I hadn't had the injuries in November/December, I would have met my goal by the end of December. But, I'm still alive and still running, so I can't complain. I'm not planning on running the Salt Lake City Half Marathon in April, because I need more time to get used to the longer distances. It is a temptation, though.I've mentioned in previous posts that in November 2007 I injured my right leg; not a big injury but a slow healing one. In December I slipped on ice and bruised my back and my tailbone. The injuries didn't prevent me from running, but I had to reduce my speed, the number of times per week, and the distance of my runs.My back has been healed for several weeks, but my tailbone has felt tender when I did my situps before my runs. In the beginning, I couldn't do the situps; my back couldn't handle the movement and force on it. I could only just wiggle my body a bit. Then, each week I could to the situps with more motion. Finally about a month ago, I was able to do situps with the full motion of my body, but my tailbone still felt tender. This indicated that my back was healed but my tailbone wasn't healed. To my joy, I noticed last week that my tailbone was no longer tender during my situps, indicating my tailbone was finally healed.After the November accident, my right leg hurt when I would bend my knee, such as sitting on a chair or kneeling on the ground. It felt fine when my leg was straight and when I walked or ran. As my leg healed, I was able to bend the leg more. I'm still not able to bend my leg the full amount, but I'm bending it almost the full amount. The main feeling that I'm having now is that my right leg tightens up during my two-hour runs. It isn't sore, just tight. The left leg, in contrast, feels fine.We had about 6 inches of snow last night, but due to wind blowing the snow, I had about a foot to shovel off my driveway and sidewalks. By the time I started my \"upper body\" workout, it was 10 am and the temperature was about 44 (F). Because of the warm temperature, the snow was melting and heavy. It took me about three hours to remove the snow. I'll be glad when spring comes...."},

I read the other day that arm movement is very important, because it influences movement of the legs. I've never had good arm movement, although I've noticed that sprinters really pump their arms.I began to move my arms back and forth in sync with my legs. However, I noticed I was also twisting my body in sync with my arms. I concentrated on pumping my arms while keeping my body from twisting, and it felt like I was running faster. My GPS showed that I was, in fact, running about a minute faster. I need to experiment with this some more before I conclude that my increase in pace was due to my arm-movement."},

It was just starting to snow, and the temperature was 27 (F). I expected the Jordan River Parkway would have a lot of ice, due to the warm temps yesterday that melted snow and caused water to run on the Parkway path and cold temps last night. I figured that if I got out quite soon, I could complete my run before the snow started to collect on the path. This was important, because I wanted to be able to see the patches of ice and navigate around them. When I got to the Parkway, a 15 mph wind was blowing, and snow was drifting onto the path. I decided not to run on the Parkway, because I didn't want to risk having ice under the drifting snow. I drove back to my house and ran in neighborhood streets.I had my ice cleats on, and I wanted to find a street that was all packed snow/ice, or a street that was all clear asphalt that I could run without the cleats. I ran a couple of miles checking out the streets and finally found a street that had strips of ice/snow the whole length (1/4 mile) that I could run with my cleats. So, I ran up and down that street for 4 miles. People seeing me through their window probably thought I was crazy. Even though I ran against a stiff headwind, I felt pretty good. In the reverse direction I had a tailwind that tried to push me, but I resisted going faster because I wanted to do a slow pace on the ice. During my run, the temperature got up to 36 (F), and I could tell the snow/ice was getting soft. I enjoyed my run even though it was a \"different\" run. I didn't get bored because I focused on completing each 1/4 mile leg of the run. All in all, I had a nice run.After I returned home, I ate breakfast (I always do morning runs on an empty stomach) and then went for a 0.6 mile walk with my 5-year-old grandson. During the first half of the walk he enjoyed stomping on clumps of snow and breaking apart pieces of ice on the sidewalk by using a pencil as a \"pick\".

About half a mile hadn't been plowed, but I passed the two plows doing that area just before I finished the run.About 200 feet from the river, I passed a low-land that was full of water from melting snow. There were lots of ducks swimming in the water. I'm hoping the ducks found more food there than they have been finding in and near the river.The shade temperature during my run was about 32 (F), and in one shady spot I saw ice on the trail. Not left-over ice from the snow storm, but ice from water that had drained from melting snow. Earlier in the day the temperature was warmer, causing the snow to melt. Then as shade encroached on the path, the temperature dropped, and the water froze. There was a lot of water on the path from melting snow, so the path will be icy tonight. As long as the sun was hitting the path, the temperature was above freezing, but as soon as the sun went behind a building or later went down, the temperature quickly dropped below freezing.

It was fun to see a kid at play with no cares in the world except stomping on the next clump."},
{"title": "I had an OK 6-mile run today", "date": "Saturday, February 02, 2008", "text": "I ran 6 miles on the Jordan River Parkway this afternoon. My body felt really sluggish during the run. I jogged/walked the first three miles to warm up, and then I ran the three miles back to my car. The shade temperature was 30 (F) when I left home, and the sun temperature, I would guess, was in the mid 30s. Some days I warm up after just a half mile, and other days I need two or three miles to warm up. My wakeup HR was 55, 10% above my normal of 50.By adding one mile to my run today, I've started to increase my distance to get back to my 5, 5, 10, 13 schedule that I had a year ago. My goal is to add a mile each week to my Wednesday run to bring it up to 10, or to my Saturday run to bring it up to 13, but I probably won't increase both runs in the same week. Of course, if my body handles the weekly one-mile increase fine, I'll probably try increasing both runs in the same week to see how that goes. It's unlikely that I'll be ready for the Salt Lake City Half-marathon in April, but I hope to be ready for the Great Salt Lake Half-marathon in August. As part of my speed training for the August race, I hope to run the 5K in South Jordan in June."},

The temperature was 30 (F) when I started and 36 (F) when I ended. The weather forecast called for an afternoon snow storm (about an inch expected), and I hoped to finish the run before the snow started falling. However, there were a few flakes falling during my run, and during the last mile the snow-fall was heavier. The snow didn't collect on the asphalt path, because the asphalt was warm from a hazy afternoon sun. When I got home, there was about an inch of new snow on the ground, and I got more exercise by shoveling the snow off my sidewalks and driveway.I was expecting a lot of ice on the path, because the temperature was in the teens last night and was still below 32 (F) when I began my run. Also, we had a bit of snow during the night. I thus put on my ice cleats. However, by the time I began my run, the snow had been plowed from the path by the city folks, and patches of snow that had been left were melting due to the warm asphalt. I quickly realized I didn't need the cleats, because the path was mostly clear of snow and ice, although it had a lot of water on it from melting snow. There were some patches of ice, and I left the cleats on. However,  during the last quarter mile, I took the cleats off and navigated around the few icy spots.Just before I reached my 2.5 mile turn-around, I discovered one of my ice cleats had come off. I back tracked and found it about 100 yards away. I had put that cleat on without taking my shoe off, and I didn't get it pulled enough over the sole of the shoe. The cleats have a rubber \"web\" that fits over the toe, heel, and soles of the shoe. The other cleat didn't come off, because I had put that one on after I took my shoe off, and I had it pulled over the sole far enough that it stayed on. Lesson learned to take shoes off to put on the cleats."},

The bird was large and has a wing-span, I would guess, about 3-4 feet. The bird has long legs, a long neck, and a small head. The bird was a light gray in color. On the head, there was a white stripe going down the middle of the head and another white stripe going down the neck. On each side of the head going through the eyes and to the back of the head were black stripes. There was a white stripe in the lower part of the neck. The wings had black and white strips mixed in with the gray color. The bird was on the bank and flew to the river and stood in the water and looked at me.I think it was a blue heron.

I didn't notice this for my shorter runs.There is an area of the Jordan River Parkway in which the path is quite close (100 feet) from the Jordan River. During the high water last spring, the river almost overflowed its banks, and it apparently did a lot of erosion damage to the river-bank.

We've had light snow for several days, and the day time temperature has been cool enough that the snow hasn't melted. So today I ran along the long north-south street that I used a couple of years ago. The street itself was clear of snow and ice due to salting of the road, and there wasn't a lot of traffic on the road. The temperature during my run was about 33 or5 34 (F), and the sky was partly cloudy with lots of sun.My path going out was around 16 with downhill excursions to 13-14. Coming back, though, I was getting tired, and my pace was around 18.

Before my accidents two months ago I ran a lot of 5-mile distances, but during my recovery, my pace has been significantly slower, meaning that 5-miles is taking a lot longer.

My goal at the end of 2006 was to run the Salt Lake City Half-Marathon in April 2007 with a new PB. I began 2007 with a month of fartleks and cadence drills mixed in with my 33 miles/week of LSD. During February I ran intervals, and during March I did hills. I ran the SLC half on April 21 with a time of 2:20:21, a PB by 55 seconds. That time gave me a second place in my age group of 70 and above.At the end of April, I decided I needed to increase my LSD pace, so I reduced my weekly mileage from 33 mpw to 20 mpw and focused on running faster. I continued this training until October 20, and I decreased my LSD pace by 2 minutes. During this time I ran two 5Ks, one on June 30 (32:28) and the other on September 22 (30:43). My time for the June 5K gave me a 2nd place in my age group. The man who was 1st beat me by 4 minutes, and he was 10 years older than me! The September 5K had its last age group as 45 and above, and I was 10th in that group.After the September 5K, I decided it was time to increase my weekly mileage back to 33 mpw with a 13-mile long run so I would be ready to run the SLC half in April 2008. By October 20, I had my long run up to 7 miles, but on that day I made a mistake. I ran a fast 5 miles in a cold rain, running fast to keep warm. I felt fine during and after the run, but by evening my legs felt a bit stiff, and by the next day my right leg and knee were feeling sore. I realized I had had my first-ever injury from running. It didn't seem like a serious injury, more like an injury I've had a few times in my arms from lifting heavy objects -- not serious but slow in healing.During November, I ran short, slow recovery runs, and by November 28, I had my \"long\" run up to 5 miles, when on that day I slipped on ice that was covered with an inch of snow such that I didn't see the ice. I really banged up my back and tailbone, and I've been recuperating from that injury during the past month.  Right now, my back and tailbone feel fine. I'll do my last run for the year on Monday, December 31, and I hope to do an enjoyable 5 miles. During the past month I've been running distances from 1 to 4 miles at a very slow pace of 17 to 15 minutes. I'm interested to see how fast my body wants to go on Monday."},

When I tried to get up from the bed, I couldn't. My back muscles were having severe spasms, one after the other, as I tried to rise up from the bed. My wife had to help me get up. I was pretty sore for the rest of the day. The only way I could keep the spasms and pain away was to stand or sit with my body perfectly balanced over my feet. I knew I'd never survive the bed, so I tried to sleep in a chaise chair. That didn't work, either. I had four extra cushions on the chair -- two for sitting and two behind my back to keep me from leaning back. I couldn't tilt the chair, because I had to keep my body aligned with the vertical. I ended up with 45 minutes of sleep that night. I didn't have much pain when I walked, stood still, or sat straight. I was just so full of stress that I couldn't go to sleep.Things improved during Thursday. I had fewer muscle spasms, and I was able to get by with two extra cushions on the chair, one for sitting and one for my back. Thursday night was another bad night for sleep -- 2 hours between the night and naps the next day. But, I was able to see improvement in my condition, and that gave me hope.Friday was a much better day. I was able to walk normally, climb stairs faster, and sit for longer periods of time. Friday night was a big improvement. No extra cushions on the chair, and two hours sleep during the night and an hour the next day in naps. As an experiment I tried taking a nap in my bed and did get half an hour, but when I tried to get up I had several mild muscle spasms due to trying to lift my body off the bed. Later in the evening I actually got sleepy before I tried to go to sleep that evening. In the two previous nights, I wouldn't be sleepy at all until just before the sun came up.I felt pretty good today, and helped my wife put up our two Christmas trees, and I vacuumed the needles off the floor after we were finished.  Tonight will be another night on the chair. I got two hours sleep last night, and my goal is a new PB tonight with three hours sleep :)I've been worried that I might have a bone fracture. However, I have no tender spots anywhere on my back. When my wife rubs the ointment on my back, she does so with significant pressure, and I think if I had a stress fracture, I would feel pain from her massaging.I'm very grateful that I didn't have bone fractures or broken bones. At my age, a fall like that could be serious. I'm grateful for the effect of running on my body, and I'm grateful for the supplements that I take to insure that I have proper nutrition.Until I get more sleep at night, I don't think I'll do any walking or running.

My wife gave her the Complete Tissue & Bone ointment, and she quickly recovered with no complications of any kind. If you saw her today, you'd never know she had that accident. Starting yesterday, I've been having a mild pain near my shoulder blades, and almost immediately after my wife rubs the ointment into my back, the pain is gone for several hours. It is a very mild pain like that from a bruise. I'm taking a Cramp Bark (2 drops in a small amount of water several times during the day) to help ward off muscle spasms, and I'm taking Dr. Christopher's Relax-Eze to help me relax and sleep better.I've been using homeopathy and herbs for almost 30 years. My wife and I like them, and we're glad we're keeping our bodies free from the chemical pollution of drugs. I chuckle every time I hear a TV ad for chemical meds that gives a long list of cautions and exceptions."},
{"title": "Fluffy snow on ice is a recipe for running with a ... thud!", "date": "Wednesday, November 28, 2007", "text": "I left about 10 am for my run on the Jordan River Parkway, hoping to go 6 miles. There was about an inch of snow on the bround, and I thought, \"No problem. I've run in deeper snow than that.\" I started my run, being careful to land in mid-sole rather than on my heels. I had gone about 1/8 mile when ... thud, I was on my back in great pain. I lay on the ground for a few minutes to let the pain subside, and then I rolled onto my hands and knees and crawled a few feet to a wooden fence that lined the path (you can see the fence in the pictures of the path that is in the left side bar). I used the fence post as a support and pulled myself to my feet. I stood there for about a minute and then hobbled to my car and drove home.I feel ok, just a small amount of pain, while standing or walking, or sitting on the edge of a chair or bed such that my center of gravity is over my hips. But, if I lean back in the chair or lie down on the bed, my back hurts more and is sensitive to jarring of my back, such as via a burp or a hiccup or a gasp for air.While I was lying on the ground, I examined the path and discovered the asphalt was covered with ice and an inch of light, fluffy snow. I should have thought of the ice, because the snow didn't come until this morning after I was up, and the temperature last night was in the mid 20s (F) and we were having snow flurries when I went to bed. But, I didn't think about the path being icy, and I was caught by surprise when my feet went out from under me.I wasn't paralyzed from my moving around, so my back isn't broken. My wife  has been rubbing my back with an Arnica gel, and I felt no pain from the pressure of her fingers. So, I think I just have a big bruise on my back muscles. If the pain doesn't subside within the next couple of days, I'll go to the ER at the hospital and have them check for bone fractures.  Needless to say, I won't be running for a few days or longer.I'm glad the accident occurred soon after I started my run. It could have happened when I was 3 miles from my car. In that case I would have called my wife on my cell and had her come and get me."},

There was only a slight wind, and the night air was crisp, cool, and a delight. Because of a full moon and light from nearby buildings, I had no problem seeing the path. I knew there were no pot holes in that part of the path, and I was able to run in the darkness and enjoy it.A half-mile segment of the run went via a detour though a residential street, and I enjoyed seeing the Christmas lights on some of the houses. Prior to that residential street, I went up the big hill that I've spoken of many times in this blog, and I made it up without stopping. At the bottom of the hill there is an American flag flying from a pole in front of a house. The pole and flag were lit by two spotlights, and it was a beautiful sight on a cold night.I felt fine at my 3.5 mile turn-around point, and I was tempted to make the run 8 miles, but I resisted and headed back. After I had gone 5 miles, I started to feel a bit tired, and by 6 miles I was definitely tired. I took extra walking breaks during the last mile, and I was glad I had kept the run to 7 miles :) It was a good run considering the only food I had had during the 12 hours since I got up was a banana.

I can walk around the house and feel fine.The only times I feel soreness are when I sit on the floor to do my hip and knee exercises and when I kneel down. Because of the cushion that I'm using on my chair, I feel stiff a bit but not much pain when I rise from the chair. I can bend my knee without pain, and that helps when I'm putting my shoes and stockings on. I feel a slight pain when I first sit on the floor and stretch my legs out in front of me. When I do the two toe-press stretches, I feel some soreness, especially when my right toe is under the left toe and is pulling toward me (the left toe is pushing away from me). That has been interesting, because in the past when I've done the toe-press I didn't feel anything. Now, I know for sure that the toe-press is truly working my leg and knee muscles!There have been a few times in the past 10-15 years that I would stress a muscle in my arm while lifting or pulling, and my arm would feel sore. It usually took several weeks for my arm to return to normal. The soreness I've been feeling feels the same way that the soreness did in my arm. Based on my recovery from my sore arm, I'm beginning to realize that the soreness in my right leg may take a few weeks to completely go away. However, since it has only been 10 days since my fast run that created a problem, and a week since my 5-mile run that reestablished the problem, I've made a lot of improvement and am getting back into my running.

A week ago when I ran fast and caused the problem, I wasn't going any faster than I did in running my last two 5K races, and I had no problems after those runs. The only thing that I can think of that makes sense is that my leg & thigh muscles are weaker than they were at the time of the two races.Prior to my fast run last week, I had gone through two weeks of a lot of walking but no running. That might have allowed my muscles to deteriorate.  Perhaps more important, I had been getting careless in doing my stretches before my runs. Before each run, I try and do the stretches that are shown on my picture page. Included are strengthening exercises for my knees, quads, and thighs. I've been skipping those exercises on quite a few of my runs, and that might have allowed my muscles to become weaker. I'm going to be more consistent in doing those exercises. Plus, as soon as I get a bench set up in my basement, I will start doing the resistance-training exercises shown on my total-body page.

In the evening, my wife and I took TRAX (train) into Salt Lake City to see our grand daughter and 3000 other music students play in the LDS Conference Center. We had to walk half a mile to/from the train and the Conference Center.

I estimated I ran 10:15, but it was probably more like 9:30. I think I overdid it, and that caused my knees and quads to be slightly sore. The same thing happened last spring when I was running intervals at the local high school. I had run several half-mile intervals with a quarter mile jog in between for recovery. As I was mid-way through one interval, I planned on doing one more, but my right quad cramped. I immediately stopped, stretched the quad, and went home. It took a couple of days for that cramp to go away.When I awoke on Sunday (yesterday), me right knee and quad felt better but were still slightly sore. When I awoke this morning, my legs felt almost normal. I decided to take today as a rest day to give my body another day to recover from my speed run on Saturday. The only soreness I've had today was when I kneel down. No soreness when I walk.When I have soreness from a run, I never try to run through it. I consider soreness a sign that I overdid it, and I give my body extra rest so it can overcome the stress. I don't want to risk having the soreness become an injury.I'm planning on running tomorrow. During the run, I'll be focused on my right leg, and if I start to feel soreness, I'll abort and walk back to my car. Also, I'll run at a comfortable LSD pace, probably around 11:30."},

For the past six months, I've been focusing on increasing the speed of my LSD and recovery runs. I think I've been successful, because I've decreased my pace 1 1/2 minutes for my LSD runs and 1 minute for my recovery runs. However, I've intentionally let slip my ability to run 13 miles.My immediate goal is to get my longer runs up to 10 miles and 13 miles, respectively, by the end of the year. Then I will have three more months to let my body get adjusted to those longer distances while I do some hills and speed workouts.Last year I ran LSD until January, and then I ran fartleks for three weeks, hills for three weeks, and intervals for three weeks. This year I want to do it a little bit differently. Between now and the end of the year, as I increase my distance, I want to run Galloway's Cadence Drills 3 or 4 times once a week. Cadence Drills are a low-level form of interval training that don't put much stress on ones body, and I think I can mix them in with my longer runs without hindering my ability to increase my distance. Then, from January to the end of March, I want to do LSD twice a month, fartleks once a month and hills once a month. I think this will be a better balance for my body, rather than the way I did it last year. We'll see. I had problems last spring doing intervals at the local high school, because I went too fast for my condition. I may go to the high school once in March and do intervals, but I don't think I'll focus on them like I did last spring."},

My pace during the first mile was about 11:30, and it was up to 11 by the time I turned around. On the way back, my pace was 10:15 to 10:30.It was a beautiful day to be out. There was a slight headwind going out.Today was the first time I've run since October 2, two weeks ago. On October 4, I started to help my son move to a different house. During the next eight days, I worked seven of the days moving boxes that weighed from 10 pounds to 50 pounds, the average weight being about 20 pounds. I worked 8-12 hours/day. I didn't run during that time, because my body was under a lot of stress from the boxes, and I didn't want to increase that stress with running. For the first four days, I handled the stress ok. I would wake up energized and feeling pretty good. But, during the last three days, the stress started getting to me. I would wake up feeling tired, and that feeling got worse with each day. I was a happy camper last Friday when I finished about 1 am and drove home.I rested over the weekend and felt pretty good. My wake up HR this morning was 51. During the box-moving days, my wakeup HR was up around 56-57."},

I didn't go the full 5 miles, because I started getting tired and didn't want to ruin my run tomorrow by pushing for that last half mile today.  I'm still not fully recovered from the 5K 10 days ago. I've been sleeping well the past few days, and that is good.Today was a really nice day. Temperature was in the high 60s (F) with no wind. A great day to be out.

{"title": "I've been monitoring my stride rate", "date": "Tuesday, October 02, 2007", "text": "During my run last Saturday, I measured my stride rate. It was pretty fast at 186 - 188. I felt good that day and had a good run. Yesterday and today I monitored my stride rate, and this is what I found.Tired run:        160-175Recovery run: 178-180Energetic run: 184-188Those numbers look reasonable. They indicate that I could use my stride rate as an indicator of my body condition. The good news is that I'm not forcing those stride rates. My body automatically wants a relatively high stride rate, and that is good. If want to do a speed workout, my body is already used to fast leg movement, and it just has to focus on a longer stride length as well as an even faster stride rate."},

When I left for my 5-mile run, it was raining, and the wind was gusting up to 10 mph. The rain lasted through out the morning and most of the afternoon, turning to snow mixed with rain in the afternoon. The temperature was 42 (F) when I left and 38 when I returned. I only saw two other runners and three walkers with two dogs on the Parkway. I enjoyed the run. I was cold for the first half mile, and then I felt fine. My wakeup HR was 53 this morning.I need to spray my nylon wind breaker with Silicone to make it water resistant again. The jacket kept the wind out fine, but the rain went right through, and I was soaked when I got back to my car. I was glad I was wearing a poly T-shirt instead of a cotton one.Because of the cold rain, I ran faster than I probably would have. I checked my stride rate several times, and it was always in the 186-188 steps/minute range. I didn't force that stride rate. My body just took me there, and it felt comfortable. I think I was running around 11 minute miles, but I didn't have my GPS with me to measure an accurate pace. That stride rate was fast enough to cause me to run a 9:30 pace, but I kept my stride length small to keep my speed down since this was a recovery run."},
{"title": "My 2nd run in this recovery week", "date": "Thursday, September 27, 2007", "text": "Today I ran 4 miles on the Jordan River Parkway. In contrast with Monday, I didn't feel particularly tired at the end of my run today. I stopped at 4 miles because I didn't want to push myself too much in this recovery run. I ran a recovery pace around 11 to 11:30.The temperature was in the high 60s (F), and it was a nice afternoon for running.This afternoon in the middle  of my run, I noticed I was slowing down and was taking longer steps. I  reduced the length of my steps and automatically took more steps/minute,  and I cut 30-45 seconds off my recovery pace, with no noticeable increase  in my output of energy. I've mentioned in previous posts that I've been  practicing during the past 5 months running at a faster LSD pace.  Basically, I've been practicing taking shorter steps more often. After 5  months of practice, the shorter, faster steps have become my \"normal\".  Thus, when I reduced my stride today, I automatically went up to my  normal rate of about 180 steps/minute.Some people will say 5 months  is a long time to practice taking smaller steps. My response is, that's  ok. I'm trading time for less stress and thus less risk of injury. I  have a whole lifetime of time, and I don't want a lifetime of injury."},
{"title": "A good 2-mile recovery run", "date": "Monday, September 24, 2007", "text": "I ran 2 miles on the Jordan River Parkway this afternoon and had a good run. When I left, I didn't have any goal as to how far I would go; I just let my body tell me when it was time to turn around. After 3/4 mile I started to get tired, and I turned around at the one-mile point. My pace going out was a restful 11 - 11:30 pace, and my pace coming back was a slower jog/walk.Between my rest last night and a short nap this afternoon, I had a good seven hours of sleep, my normal amount.Thanks to a storm front that passed through yesterday afternoon and evening, we had cooler weather, and the temperature during my run was a sunny but cool mid 50s (F).My friend, Bruce, is encouraging me to try once again to break 30 minutes in a 5K. It would be nice to meet that goal before winter comes since I'm so close to it. There is a 5K on Saturday, October 20, 2008 in Murray, Utah at Wheeler Farms. It is described as a flat, fast course on cinders. It starts at 8:30 am, so the temperature will be in the high 30s or low 40s (F). That sounds like a nice race to run. That is two days before my birthday, and breaking 30 minutes would be a nice birthday present to give myself.Another thing I'm considering is to use my GPS to measure my own 3.1 course on the Jordan River Parkway and to run an unofficial 5K race. The advantage of this latter option is that I could choose my own date/time for the \"race\", thus insuring that I have a high energy level when I run it. I don't need to make a decision for a couple of weeks, so I'll see how my recovery goes."},
{"title": "I raced a good 5K and enjoyed the event!", "date": "Saturday, September 22, 2007", "text": "I finished the 5K at Daybreak, South Jordan, Utah in 30:43, a decrease of 1:45 and a new PB! I was 54th across the finish line out of 238 runners and walkers. I was 10th (out of 19) in the age group of 46-99. Not bad for an almost 72-year-old geezer. My splits wereMile 1:  9:53    (includes part of a 30-second walking break)Mile 2: 10:24 (includes the rest of a 30-second walking break)Mile 3:  9:32    (followed by a 0.1 mile sprint to the finish)One runner, who is much younger than me, told me that he watched me come in to the finish and I was going pretty fast. I had a negative split for the race, and that is good. I hadn't planned on taking walking breaks, but as I neared the end of the first mile, I was pretty tired and took a short walking break, my only break. My mile 2 split shows how tired I was in mid race. Most of the first mile was level. Most of the second mile was uphill (not a steep hill, just a continuous uphill grade), and all of the third mile was downhill.My average pace for the race was 9:53. To meet my goal of breaking 30 minutes, I would have needed an average of 9:40. I came close. I did get a new PB, and I'm happy with the race.I walked and jogged for about a mile before the race to begin my warm-up. However, I wasn't fully warmed up until the end of mile 2. This same pattern, needing 2-3 miles to warm up, has been noted in my blog lately.I commented in my blog a few days ago that I suffered a serious sleep deficit  last week. I didn't mention in my blog that I had another sleep deficit Thursday night. And, I had a still another sleep deficit last night, as I always do when I have something important going on the next day. My wakeup heart rate was 3 beats higher this morning than it has been during the past few days. So, I wasn't in very good shape for this race, and I think I did very well considering everything.After I ran the Salt Lake City Half-Marathon in April 2007, I decided to focus on increasing my LSD pace. I've succeeded in increasing it by a minute to a minute and a half.With the completion of the 5K today, I'm shifting gears in my training. I need to bring my medium and long runs back to their 10 miles and 13 miles respectively. So, beginning with my long run next week, I will start increasing the distance of those two runs by 1 mile per week. I should be finished with this phase of my training by the end of the year. Then, during the Winter and early Spring, I will mix a few speed workouts into my long distance, doing cadence drills and fartleks. If I meet my end-of-the-year goal, I will have about three months for my body to get used to the 13 mile distance that I will run when I do the Salt Lake City Half-Marathon on April 19, 2008."},

I've slept well for the past three nights, but I'm still not up to my normal energy level. I hope that I recover from last week before the race on Saturday. If not, my performance will suffer.By the way, the open house went well. About 150 people attended, a good mixture of family and old friends. A copy of the book of photographs and some text about my mother-in-law that I made was on each table, and people enjoyed browsing through the book. My wife interviewed seven people who gave tributes to her mother, and I recorded the interviews and put them into a DVD. The seven people gave some special remembrances of my mother-in-law.

{"title": "Tempo run yesterday?", "date": "Saturday, September 08, 2007", "text": "I've been thinking about my run yesterday, and I think it was likely a tempo run. I normally take two steps per breath, two steps in and two steps out. Yesterday, during my 2nd and 3rd laps, I was taking one step per breath for almost the whole mile. I have a very large chest, and I assume that means I have a large lung-capacity. My 40-year-old son and I were comparing our chests one day, and mine is twice as thick as his. My normal running cadence is about 180, but my cadence during the run, hence the number of breaths per minute, was probably close to 190. I was taking deep breaths, and I used lots of oxygen.I've been hoping that the adrenaline factor of the race plus a 25 degree (F) lower temperature during the race would let me run close to a 9 minute pace during the 5K race in two weeks. However, based on yesterdays results, those factors may just help me continue a 9:30 pace for the full 3.1 miles instead of for 1 mile. We'll see.Too bad I didn't have my heart rate monitor on yesterday. It would be interesting to see how high my heart rate went. Maybe I need to trade my Garmin 101 for a 301 :)Well, back to bed.

{"title": "Hey, I'm 40 again", "date": "Wednesday, August 29, 2007", "text": "This evening, after the sun had set, I ran a planned 3.5 miles on the Jordan River Parkway. By the time I had completed one mile, it was dark, and beautiful. I enjoy running at night because the world seems different. Quiet, peaceful. There is enough light from nearby buildings and parking lots that I have no problem staying on the path. It's nice to look at the lights of nearby and distant buildings. As I went past a golf course, there were people on the putting range enjoying their sport in the cooler evening. I still heard birds chirping nearby. I could see lights reflecting off the water of the Jordan River, and there were black spots all over the river, ducks and geese settled in for the night. During the first part of my run, I saw quite a few runners and walkers and bikers finishing their workouts. I saw two kids, a boy and a girl, walking on the wooden rail that borders the first part of my run, their arms stretched out to provide balance. As I went past the boy, who was about 10, I said, \"You're better at that than I am.\" He made a comment, but I couldn't hear what he said. During my run, I still had sweat all over my face, but not nearly as much as I have during mid-day when the temp is in the mid 90s (F).It took me about 2 miles to warm up, and during the remainder of the run I felt like I did when I was cruising the back roads of Massachusetts. It was a great feeling! A feeling like I could go on forever. No pain, no huffing or puffing, just cruising at a 10:40 pace. When I finished my run, I stretched by the large South Jordan sign that is at the beginning/end of my run. After I finished my \"wall pushers\" and I was standing by the sign, the thought came to me that I'm 40 again. The temperature was in the low 70s (F) during my run, and that lower temperature might have contributed to the success of this run. However, a few days ago I ran earlier in the morning when the temperature was in the mid 70s, and I didn't have this feeling. What ever caused the feeling tonight, it was nice!I think this is the way that all LSD runs should be finished. No feelings of being tired. No huffing or puffing. No sore legs. Just a great feeling from having a strong, healthy body. Many runners will run LSD until they're really tired, until they can't run any more. I prefer to stop while I'm still feeling great and want to continue but know I need to stop. I prefer to stop while I feel great, so I can look forward to the next run. Running LSD this way is just intuitive with me, the logical and common sense way to run. I was glad when I first read George Sheehan's essay on jogging (The Basics of Jogging) to find that he also espouses this way of running. That essay was the first thing I ever read in the running literature, and I immediately bonded with the essay because most of the ideas he advocated were things that I was already doing. This is why he has been my mentor for all my years of running."},

I actually felt a little bit cold when I first started, but I was sweating by the time I reached the 1/2 mile mark. My wakeup HR was 50.One disadvantage of running at sunup or sundown is there are lots of small moths, insects or what ever they are that hit your face and get into your eyes. They hover in clouds near the bank of the river. They are larger than gnats and are a whitish color instead of the dark color of gnats. Most of the Parkway trail is far enough from the river bank that these things aren't a problem, but in a few places the trail gets close to the river and goes through clouds of these things.

I could have continued that pace for the 3.1 miles, but Mother Nature was calling and I had to make a pit stop at a restroom in a nearby pavilion.There are three improvements I'll make for my simulation next week.First, I'll go slower in my one-mile warm up. I ran that mile this morning at a pace of 11:15, which is too fast for a warm up. Next week I'll do more walking during the warm up and will jog at a pace around 12 minutes.Second, I'll try to go out not quite so fast. Even though I quickly slowed down today, I did waste some energy during that first quarter mile.Third, I won't carry any water or Gatorade with me, thus having less weight to carry. When I left home for my run, I had forgotten that today was simulation day, and I carried my 24 ounces of liquid, a weight of over 1 1/2 pounds plus the weight of my fuel belt. Next week I'll drink in my car before I begin the run and then again when I return to the car.To break 30 minutes in the 5K, I need to run 9:40, and I ran close to that today for 2 miles. I shouldn't have a problem completing the 3.1 miles next week, and then I'll just need to bring my pace down to 9:30 - 9:40.I'll probably do the simulation on Friday next week because I have an activity Saturday morning, and I don't want to run later in the evening.I ran in my new Carumba today.

The temperature when I left home was 76 (F), and it was 89 when I returned.My next race will be a 5K on September 22. The race starts at 9 am and will be in the Daybreak area of South Jordan.During the summer, races usually start around 6 am to take advantage of the cool night air. This race, however, is starting three hours later, implying that the September temperatures will be cooler. I checked my blog for last year to see what the morning temperature was, and on September 23, 2006 the temp was 44 (F). Thus, September 22, 2007 should be a great day for a race, assuming it isn't windy or storming."},

I ran a slow pace from 11:30 to 12:00 for 3 1/2 miles. It felt hot to me, even though the temperature was in the low to mid 80s (F).I can think of two reasons why I was tired. First, I had good runs on Saturday and yesterday, and I needed a rest day. Second, my wife and I attend a family reunion last night, and I was on my feet for over three hours, including a mile walk around a pond. The good news is that I've been sleeping well."},

On the way out I ran from 11 - 11:30, and on the way back I ran from10:30 - 11, although I ran the last half mile about 10:20. My wakeup HR was 51.Since I ran the half-marathon in April, I've been trying to increase my long slow distance pace. I've been doing this by just running faster, hoping that my body will adopt the higher speed as its normal speed.However, I'm thinking of running another 5K on September 22, and I would like to break 30 minutes. To do that I would have to run a pace of 9:40 with no walking breaks. I'm thinking I should practice that pace during the next month so it will be something I'm familiar with. Thus, I think that on Saturdays I will run 3.1 miles at a pace of 9:35 and no walking breaks. I will run a restful mile before the 3.1 miles to warm up and a restful mile after the 3.1 miles to cool down. My other three runs will be similar to the runs I've been doing. In addition, I've been taking walking breaks during my five miles because of the heat, but with cooler weather coming up, I shouldn't need to take them."},

I timed the last half-mile at 10:28, but during the last quarter mile I was running 10:15.The temperature was 67 when I left and 78 when I returned, thanks to a storm front that is passing through.

According to photos on the race web site, there were only about 50 people who ran it last year. It looks like a small-town race that should be fun to run. I won't get a medal, though, because my age group for the race is 45 and above. I would like to break 30 minutes."},

The shade temperature when I left was about 80 (F), and it was about 90 when I returned.I usually run first thing in the morning before I have breakfast. In the past I've been able to eat something light before I left for the run, but I'm finding now that I'm running faster for my LSD and rest paces, I can't eat anything.

My wakeup HR was 53.I saw a family on the Parkway. The mother was pushing a stroller, and two sons were riding bikes. The older son was about 10, and he was about 100 yards in front of his family. As I neared him, I said to him, \"I'll race you to that green sign\" (a distance of about 100 yards). He smiled, turned around, and took off to the sign. Since this was a rest day, I just continued my pace. As I neared the sign, the boy had turned around and was heading back toward me. As I ran past him, I held out my hand and gave him a \"high 5\"."},
{"title": "Don't ignore pain, even minor pain", "date": "Monday, August 06, 2007", "text": "On Thursday evening, Friday, and Saturday of last week, I could feel a minor pain in my right quad. At first I ignored it, because I thought it was probably from my sitting at my computer for several hours on Thursday. The pain was very weak, and I didn't notice it much during the day. However, I had a slight difficulty walking, because my right foot felt weak, and, my knees felt a bit weak when going up stairs.After my run Saturday morning, I decided I'd better do something about the pain, to prevent it from evolving into an injury. I stretched my quads during the rest of Saturday, several times on Sunday, and this morning before I ran. As soon as I stretched my quads, I could feel a reduction in the pain, and by Saturday afternoon the pain was gone. It was also gone on Sunday and so far today.The moral of this story is that if you experience an abnormal condition in your body, don't ignore it because it may get worse; give it appropriate treatment. I usually don't have any pain in my body, so that minor pain was abnormal. If I had ignored it, it might have evolved into an injury.Even though I haven't had the pain since Saturday morning, I'm going to continue stretching my quads for a few days."},

I felt fine and enjoyed the run.Even though it was after 10 am when I left home, it was about 10 degrees (F) cooler than it has been, due to a storm front that has been passing through (lots of rain during the past couple of days). The temperature was 78 (F) when I left home and in the low 80s (F) when I returned. I'm sure the lower temperature helped. And, a 6-7 tailwind on the way back may have helped a bit, too, but the same wind was a headwind on the way out :(There is a surveyor's  benchmark next to the Parkway, and on my way back, I stopped to read the elevation at that point. The BM said 4314 feet. My GPS said 4344 feet. Considering that my GPS is an old three-satellite device, the 30 foot discrepancy is ok."},
{"title": "My first racing flats", "date": "Thursday, August 02, 2007", "text": "If you've been reading my blog for very long, you'll know that I run in LOCO shoes from http://www.locorunning.com/ LOCO has a \"Club LOCO\" that gives discounts to club members. Anyone can become a club member via email. Each month Club LOCO members receive a discount off of LOCO shoes, and they usually get a free item with the shoes, such as a poly T-shirt, a singlet, stockings, or a cap. This month they gave a free pair of Bandito racing shoes. So, I ordered an extra pair of Carumba shoes (24% discount) and got my Bandito shoes.I tried the Bandito shoes this morning and ran half a mile with no problems. I want to try them out at distances at least up to 5K, because racing shoes have less cushioning than training shoes (that's why they are called flats), and I want to be sure my feet handle the shoes fine. LOCO claims that the Bandito has more cushioning than most flats, and they felt fine for for the short half-mile run. The Bandito weighs 8.5 oz compared to 9.9 oz for my Carumba.Later: I've been reading about racing flats and have learned that they may only affect my pace by 10-15 seconds. The web sites I visited emphasized that flats have a greater risk of injury than trainers due to  less cushioning.  The sites also emphasized that unless one is running 7-minute miles or faster, the benefits of flats don't compensate for the risks of using them. So, I think I'll put the flats away and save them for the time when I'm running 7-minute miles :)"},

The shade temperature when I left home was 82 (F) and 88 (F) when I returned home.My wife came with me, and she walked 3 miles. I caught up with her towards the end, and we walked the last 1/8 mile together.One year ago, I was a week away from my three-week taper before the Great Salt Lake Half-Marathon. My fastest training run at that time was at a 11:34 pace for 13 miles. Now, a 11:34 pace is a slow, restful pace, and my \"high energy\" pace for 10 miles is 10:00 minutes. I said 10 miles not 13 miles, because I've reduced my distance since the Salt Lake City Half-Marathon in April so I could focus on getting a faster LSD pace.If I can cut another minute 30 seconds from my pace by this time next year, I'll be ready to break 2 hours in a half-marathon and hopefully be down in the mid to high 20s (minutes) for a 5K."},

My pace during that last half-mile was 10:38. I felt fine. My wakeup HR was 47.I was on the trail about half and hour earlier than yesterday, but the temperatures were about the same as yesterday (76 (F) when I left home and 86 (F) when I returned).Because I was on the trail a bit earlier, there were more and longer shady spots. During the longer shady spots, I could feel the difference between being in the sun and being in the shade. While in the shade, my poly T-shirt felt cool to my skin.As I approached the access road to the parking lot for the Jordan River Parkway at 9800 South, the traffic slowed almost to a stop, and I could see flashing police lights down by the river. After I turned into the parking lot, I saw several fire department vehicles and hazard-waste vehicles. I parked and asked a nearby fireman what had happened. He said a man had gone off the road and into the river. The man got out and called 911. By the time I got there, the emergency crew had used a large crane on a semi and had pulled the car from the river, and the emergency workers were packing up to leave. It looked like they had a lot more vehicles there than they would need. I guess the situation provided training for the emergency folks as well as getting the car out of the river. When I returned from my run an hour later, all of the emergency vehicles were gone, and traffic on 9800 South was back to normal."},

I noticed a few days ago that the seams in the pack (it is made of canvas) are tearing out, because I also stuff in my cell phone and car key. I decided to splurge and get a Fuel Belt that carries six 8-ounce bottles. That is 8 ounces more that I was carrying on hot days. The belt also has a nice pouch for my cell phone and key. The bottles are distributed uniformly around the belt and thus help to keep me balanced.The fuel belt worked fine on my run this morning. I used three bottles, two of water and one of Gatorade. I've been drinking half water and half Gatorade, and I decided last week to go to a 2:1 ratio.

The temperature when I left home was 72 (F), and I felt good on the way out even though my wakeup HR was 53, a bit higher than it has been. I also felt good on the way back, even though the temperature was significantly higher. It has been about a month since I did 10 miles, and it felt great. I purposely am reducing my distance while I increase my pace, but I'm hoping to keep the ability to run 10 miles so I won't have to do a lot of work to get my distance back to 13.1 miles.After I finish a run, I always go into the tunnel under 9800/10000 South to be in the shade while I stretch. There is usually a breeze in the tunnel, due to the funnel-effect of the tunnel, and that breeze really felt good this morning.I forgot my GPS (again), so I timed two half-mile segments to get an idea of my pace. On the way out, I timed the segment from 1.5 miles to 2.0 miles, and my pace was 9:31 minutes/mile. I chose that segment, because I'm usually warmed up by 1.5 miles, and I know accurately where the segment begins and ends. I could tell I wasn't ready for that fast of a pace because my throat was slightly raw, so I slowed down a bit for the rest of the run.On the way back, I timed myself over the same segment, and my pace was 10:21. I had run 8 miles when I started this segment, and I was, I'm sure, getting tired. Also, the temperature was significantly higher on the way back. When I left home, the temperature was 72 (F), and when I returned home, the temperature was 91 (F).Those paces of 9:31 and 10:21 are almost exactly the paces for my new goals. The 10:21 pace was close to the pace I maintained over the 6 miles between the two measurements. I'm not claiming that I've reached my new goals, because, as I mentioned, I wasn't ready for the 9:31 pace. But, it is interesting that I reached the two numbers, even for just a few minutes in the case of the first number. Running my goal recovery pace for most of the run was appropriate since I doubled the mileage from most of my runs the past couple of weeks and thus needed to run slower that I would if I were just going 5 miles. Also, before I claim I've reached my new goals, I want to be able to repeat my new paces for quite a few runs such that I feel comfortable with the higher speeds.I've explained in previous posts that I wore motion-control shoes for 20 years when I should have been wearing neutral shoes. I'm a supinator, and neutral shoes are recommended for supination. I now have 155 miles on my first pair of Carumba by Loco Running. The shoes have been working fine. In fact, I've noticed two improvements over my motion-control shoes.Last fall I began noticing a \"weakness\" in my left foot. There was no pain, just a feeling that my foot couldn't support my weight. The feeling only came after 8 or 9 miles, and, in the beginning, it didn't last long. However, as the winter and spring progressed, the feeling came more often and lasted longer. During the past 155 miles, I haven't had that feeling, and I've done several 10-mile runs.The second improvement is more complicated. Let me explain. In my home we have a custom of not wearing shoes in the house, and for years I've gone around the house bare footed. About five years ago, I was walking in my bedroom in the dark, and I stubbed my toe. I was walking fast, and I really jammed my toe.  About a month later, I did the same thing to the same toe. I may have broken the toe, or something, because ever since that time I've had a numbness in that toe. I haven't worried about the injury, because the numbness hasn't increased and hasn't seemed to handicap my walking and running.When walking, I didn't have pain with the numbness. But, when I ran I did have a small pain in the toe; after a mile or so of running, the pain went away. I still have the numbness, but since changing to the Carumba shoes, I don't feel the pain. I don't know if this lack of pain is due to my changing from motion-control to neutral shoes, or if it is due to a slight difference in the width of the two shoes. The Carumba shoes are more comfortable and seem to be slightly wider."},

Then I noticed the runners at the rear of the group were older and slower, so I knew they weren't on a team. I asked one of the runners as I passed him what group they were with, and he yelled, \"the college, Post Academy.\" I had never heard of Post Academy, so I googled it when I got home and found out it is the training academy for Peace (police) Officers.Last week just as I was ready to drive away from the parking lot, a bunch of cars came in that were filled with men and a few women who were wearing what looked like soccer uniforms -- blue shorts, white T-shirts, and blue number-bibs (with white numbers) over the shirts.

I let my body set its own pace, and it set paces from about 11:30 to 12:20. My perceived effort was about the same as yesterday, and I enjoyed the run. I was surprised that I didn't suffer, emotionally or physically, from the heat. I think I may be acclimating to the higher temperatures.Instead of talking walking breaks every half-mile, I took them every quarter mile, and drank my customary swallow of Gatoraid and swallow of water at each break. All together, I drank about 35 ounces of liquid.I thought I'd summarize how I handle heat while running.1. Eat properly during the day before your run so you'll have the energy you need to complete the distance AND to handle the heat.2. Be well hydrated during the day and night before your run by drinking more liquids.3. Use the urine test before and after a run to test for dehydration. A slight yellow color is ok. Anything very dark indicates dehydration. The darker the color, the more the dehydration.4. When possible run earlier in the morning or later at night when the temperature is lower.5. If possible, choose a course that has some shade. Pause in or walk through the shady spots.6. Run so your perceived effort for the run is about the same as it would be if you were running in a lower temperature. This means you'll run slower to reduce the stress on your body from the heat. Save your speed workouts for lower temperatures. Remember: Spring and Fall are for training. Summer and Winter are for surviving.7. Take walking breaks if you normally don't take them, or walking breaks more often if you normally do take them, to give your body relief from the heat."},

The temperature maxed at 100 (F) in the shade and was hotter than that in the direct sun. I also spent two hours pulling weeds in the evening when the temperature was in the mid 80s (F). When I ran this morning I could tell that I was pretty tired, so I only ran 3 miles instead of my planned 4 miles. I slept well last night, and my wakeup HR was 48 this morning (46 yesterday), but the toll on my body from hours in the sun was much greater than the benefit of the sleep. I drank a lot of water yesterday and took rest breaks, and I felt pretty good during the evening. But, I could tell almost immediately when I started running that I was tired."},

I didn't have my GPS with me, so I timed the last half-mile at 5:47 or a 11:34 pace.When I went through the tunnel under 9800 South yesterday, the swallow nest was intact, but when I went through the tunnel today, the nest was on the ground and an egg was smashed on the ground. It's too bad, but I assume the city has to insure the safety of persons using the path. A lot of people are paranoid about animals, and someone in the city government apparently felt the birds shouldn't be nesting in the tunnel. I walk through the tunnel about 20 times per week, been doing that for a lot of weeks, and I've never been attacked by the birds. The nest was up about 10 feet, and one would need either a long stick or a ladder to knock the nest down. For this reason, I assume it was done by a city employee not just a walker going by."},

I think other world-class runners suggest that, too. And, my friend Bruce from Vegas suggests that. So, I thought I'd better start doing it.Having the first week of the month be a rest week fits my schedule best, so this week is a rest week. My initial goals for a rest week are to reduce my distance by about 20% and to run only comfortable, rest runs.I ran for four miles on the Jordan River Parkway and really enjoyed it. I listened to my body and ran a comfortable pace (around 11:00 to 11:30 pace), and I enjoyed being out, even with a temperature in the low 90s (F). I drank about 10 ounces of Gatorade and 10 ounces of water during my walking breaks every half mile. I felt pretty good and had a reasonable energy level for a hot day. My wakeup HR was 51, about what it has been for the past couple of weeks.During the 5k, while running down the Jordan River Parkway, we passed a section where the city had sprinklers putting water on some grass that bordered the path. A young boy who was just in front of me, he was about 8 or 9 years old, moved over to the edge of the path so the water would hit him. That reminded me of the times when I ran during the noon hour at work in Massachusetts and the company had sprinklers running on the grass. When I finished a run and was dripping with sweat, I would walk onto the lawn and lie down so the sprinklers would spray me with water. That really felt good!"},
{"title": "My Carumba neutral shoes are doing well", "date": "Monday, July 02, 2007", "text": "I mentioned in previous posts that I've been wearing motion-control shoes for the past 20 years when I should have been wearing neutral shoes (I don't know why I wasn't injured from having the wrong shoes, but I'm glad I wasn't). I switched to LOCO Carumba neutral shoes on May 11, and I've put 119 miles on those shoes. I've had no problems with them, and they fit my feet a little bit better than my LOCO Mojo shoes did. I won't know until I have 500 miles on them if the Carumba are a better shoe for my feet.  Even then, I probably won't be able to draw any conclusion from the Carumba shoes feeling fine and not causing injury, because the Mojo shoes felt that way, too.There are two things I can look for that may help me draw a comparison between the Carumba and the Mojo shoes.Compression of the right heel. I've explained in previous posts that I have a skeletal problem that causes me to walk on the outside of my right shoe, and this causes the heel to compress more on the outside than it does on the inside. The Mojo shoes do have a slight amount of that compression after 500 miles.I've explained in previous posts that, starting in the Fall of 2006, I started having a \"weak\" feeling in my left foot. By \"weak\", I mean as in unable to support weight. No pain or soreness, just a feeling that I couldn't put much weight on the foot. This feeling would appear on runs longer than about 8 miles. During the winter and spring, the feeling became more pronounced and started to have a bit of pain with the feeling. Since changing to the Carumba, I've run one 9-miler and one 10-miler, and I haven't felt that feeling. However, I need more miles and more longer runs on the Carumba to see if the feeling occurs or not.So, I'll report back about this from time to time as I put more miles on the Carumba."},
{"title": "2nd in my age-group at the 5K", "date": "Saturday, June 30, 2007", "text": "The race began at 6:00 am, and by 6:32:28 I was finished. My time of 32:28 gave me a 2nd place in my age group of 70 and older. I was 94th out of about 220 runners. My average for the race was 10:26. I took 30-second walking breaks every half mile, and sometimes I took them more often. Subtracting the break-times gives me approximately a 9:15 average pace for my actual running. I drank no liquids during the race because the sun hadn't come up and the temperature was in the mid to high 60s (F).I've been looking at my progress during the past 12 months. During that time I ran several 13-mile training runs, two half-marathons, and one 5K. Since the 5K is a shorter race, I've looked at my pace for the first three miles of my fastest training run and each half-marathon and for today's 5K. Here are the pace numbers (times spent in walking breaks have been removed):June 2006 (training run) 12:00August 2006 (half marathon) 9:49April 2007 (half marathon) 9:38June 2007 (5K) 9:15I'm pleased with my progress, and I hope I can continue that progress during the coming year.I think my training the past two months to increase my pace helped me this morning. During my training runs, I ran 10 minute miles when I felt good and 11 to 11:30 miles when I didn't feel quite so good (those times don't include walking breaks). Today was one of my not quite so good days, and I ran faster than I've been doing in my better training runs.I'm going to continue working on a faster pace during the summer to allow my body to better adjust to the increased speed, and I'll decide in the Fall if I should continue doing that or if I should cap my pace and slowly lengthen my distance back to the 30 - 33 miles per week I was running before the half-marathon in April. It will be a significant challenge for me to run my faster pace over a half-marathon distance. Meeting that challenge is a great motivation for me! To give me numbers to aim for, I've reduced my goal-paces by 30 seconds."},

After I had finished a one-mile warm up, I ran at a faster pace. Starting at the two-mile marker, I timed a half-mile segment at a pace of 11:10. On the way back, at the 7-mile marker, I timed a half-mile segment at a pace of 10:40. I timed the last half-mile segment at a pace of 11:20. Those paces are approximate, because I may not have started and stopped at the exact markers. Considering the heat, those are good paces for a longer distance.My 5K race is next Saturday, so today was my last heavy run before the race. My running on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday of next week will be light, rest runs. I'm going to focus on getting more sleep this week so I'll be rested and can (hopefully) peak for the race. I'll be happy with anything below 30 minutes, but I would like to get a 27-minute time, and a 25-minute time would be a miracle.The shade temperature was 80 (F) when I left for my run and 97 when I returned. Those are *shade* temperatures. Most of my run is in direct sunlight, and the effect of the sun was much worse than the shade temperature would imply.A couple of times during the run, I started to feel woozy which I recognized as a first sign of heat exhaustion. I drank extra water and Gatorade and felt fine. All together, I drank 20 ounces of water and 20 ounces of Gatorade.After the first mile warmup, I only took walking breaks at my planned half-mile intervals (well, there were a couple of exceptions to that), but the breaks were usually longer than my normal 30 seconds. My turn-around point was in the tunnel under 126th South, and I stopped for several minutes and enjoyed the shade and breeze blowing through the tunnel."},

I mix 4 or 5 drops of the Essential Oil with 10 or 15 drops of the \"mixing\" oil.After I park at the 98th South entrance to the Jordan River Parkway, I walk through the tunnel under the street and then about 100 yards to the edge of the river, where the path ends. I noticed this morning that the nest built by the two swallows who dwell there had been removed. All traces of the mud were gone, so it wasn't a case of someone taking a stick and poking at the nest. I assume that employees of South Jordan City  removed the nest. Too bad. I enjoyed seeing the nest there. Maybe somebody complained about the swallows flying in the tunnel. Maybe the city was concerned about liability."},

He asked, \"Any problems with your joints?\" I said, \"No\". \"Taking anything for your joints?\" \"No\". \"How long you been running?\" \"34 years\". We then talked for a few minutes about losing weight via running.I think he stopped me, because I'm currently wearing a beard that makes me look a bit older. My wife is in Europe for 2 1/2 months as a traveling nanny for my daughter and son-in-law who are abroad doing historical research and who will be presenting papers at two conferences in Switzerland in July. My beard is my \"bachelor beard\" :)Yesterday, I was running, and two older men passed me on their bikes. One of them shouted out, \"Keep it up, youngster!\" This morning I passed a walker, and she said, \"You're awesome\".Before I grew my beard, I never received comments like these, so I like that the beard makes me look older and thus more of a \"miracle runner\" in the eyes of the runners who comment to me.Here are my before and after pictures."},

Even though I wasn't gone long, it was nice to enjoy the peace of the evening along the Jordan River for a while.I met a nice gentleman who was out walking a big, white, friendly dog. We talked for about 5 minutes. He does some running and walking several times per week. We talked about weight-loss, and he was surprised when I said that one mile of walking or running burns about 100 calories and that you have to burn 3500 calories to lose a pound. We talked about reducing food intake by about 300 calories per day by cutting out sodas, sweets, and as he called it \"junk food\"."},

I've decided to make the change.Before I ran the SLC half marathon in April, I ran light 5-mile runs on both Monday and Tuesday, and I ran a heavy intermediate 10-mile run on Wednesday and a heavy 13-mile long run on Saturday. The heavy runs were heavy because of distance not pace. Now that I'm running faster, I want to be sure I follow the heavy/light schedule. My heavy runs are now Tuesday and Saturday. Those runs are shorter than they were before the half marathon, but they are heavy because of my faster pace. My light runs are now Monday and Wednesday and are light because of a slower pace and if need-be a shorter distance than the 5 miles I did before the half marathon. Hopefully after a few months, my body will have adapted to my faster pace, and I'll be able to increase the distance of my heavy runs while keeping my faster pace."},

I ran 5 miles on the Jordan River Parkway in shade temperatures of the low 80s (F), which means the sun temperature was close to 100 (F). I took 12 ounces of water and about 10 ounces of Gatorade and drank my usual swallow at each half-mile walking break.During the first mile warm up, I ran a 11:30 mile. Then I ran about 11 minute miles for the next mile and a half. Then, on the way back, I ran 10 minute miles. This means that, according to my new goals, I ran a mile to warm up, and then I ran my recovery LSD pace for a mile and a half. Then I ran my comfortable LSD pace for the remaining 2 1/2 miles. Those statistics show that my warm up was actually more than the first mile. Because of the heat, I don't think I could have maintained the 10 minute pace for another 5 miles like I did on Saturday, but I'm happy with my paces today. A shade temperature of 82-83 (F) is a hot temperature for running a path with little shade, meaning I was running in sun temperatures close to 100 (F). Due to our high mountain elevation (4200 feet along the Parkway), the sun here burns a lot more than it did in New England.As soon as I started running, I could tell I was stronger than yesterday, because yesterday I took walking breaks about every quarter mile and still felt tired, while today I took them at every half mile and felt great. I just needed that extra day to recover from Saturday's run. Drinking liquids while I ran this morning helped too, I'm sure."},

I slowed down because I decided I'd done enough speed work, and I slowed to a comfortable recovery pace.For my current condition, a 10 minute pace is a fast pace, but it isn't quite fast enough to be a tempo pace.Because of a busy day, I didn't run until late in the evening. When I left home, it was 9 pm, and the sun had already set. Even though the sun was down, it was still light outside when I began my run. However, about a mile before I turned around, it was dark. I thus ran about 6 miles in the dark.During my 17 years in Massachusetts, I ran in the early morning, before the sun was up, for several years. I had no trouble running the back roads in the dark, even though there were no street lights, because the asphalt road was a lighter gray than the trees and bushes bordering the road. My secret is that I navigated the roads by distinguishing between shades of gray. I also knew there weren't potholes that could trip me. And, the skunks heard me coming and scooted out of the way.So it is on the Jordan River Parkway. In addition, there aren't many trees and tall bushes bordering the Parkway path, and light from the sky and from nearby buildings and parking lots shines on the path. Also, I know there aren't any obstacles on the path that could trip me.Our high temperature today was about 85 (F). I could have run during the afternoon when the temperature was close to max, but I decided to run in the evening when it wouldn't be so hot. When I left home to go to the parkway, it was 70 (F).

The man settled back again, and was just dozing off when there was another knock on the window and another jogger. \"Excuse me, sir, do you have the time?\" \"8:25!\" The jogger said thanks and left.Now the man could see other joggers passing by and he knew it was only a matter of time before another one disturbed him. To avoid the problem, he got out a pen and paper and put a sign in his window saying \"I do not know the time!\" Once again he settled back to sleep.

The temperature was in the 70s during the run, and it was a beautiful sunny day.On April 30 I explained in this blog that I think I've been running for 20 years in the wrong shoes, that I should be using neutral shoes. I ordered a pair of LOCO Carumba shoes and did my first run in them today. They felt fine. I'll need to put quite a few miles on them before I know how they are doing with my stiff jointed, supinated feet.I've explained in previous posts that I was born with a defect in my skeleton that causes me to walk on the outside of my feet, especially my right foot. In the past, the top of the heel of my right shoe would bulge to the outside of the shoe, and the outside of the heel would compress. All of this caused my ankle to be tilted to the outside. For 20 years I used motion-control shoes, and this helped with quite a bit to keep the heel from compressing and to reduce the bulging. I noticed a few weeks ago that the heel of my right shoe was slightly compressed and slightly bulged to the outside. After I read about shoes, I discovered that supinators should use neutral shoes, not motion control or correction shoes, because the MC and correction shoes cause the foot to go to the outside. What I really need are motion control shoes that would cause my foot to go to the inside, but since only 2% of the runners are supinators, shoe companies don't make shoes for them. Thus, the best supinators can do is use neutral shoes.One of the towns down here is South Jordan. I just signed up for the SJ Country Fest 5K race on June 30 at 6 am.South Jordan Country Fest"},

{"title": "A tired run", "date": "Monday, April 30, 2007", "text": "I ran for 2.3 miles but was pretty tired. My pace during the run was 11 to 11:30.I think there are several possible reasons for my being tired. I'm still in the recovery from my half-marathon. I'm running significantly faster than I did in my training runs before the half. I ran late Saturday evening instead of Saturday morning, so my usual two-day rest over the weekend was significantly reduced. I've only had about 6 1/2 hours sleep the past couple of days. My body did well last week with the faster pace, so a minor slump this week isn't unusual. Rather than push myself to do more distance, I aborted and came home so I'll be in better shape for tomorrow.I've been doing a lot of reading over the weekend, and I came to a realization that I made a mistake 20 years ago in selecting my running shoes. Let me explain.I started running about 1973 in Phoenix. I didn't know that running shoes existed, and I ran in my work shoes, army boots, and old sneakers (known as gym shoes back in that era). I worked up to about 3 miles two or three times a week. Then, in February 1976, I moved to Massachusetts with a new job in Maynard, MA.The Digital Running Club was just getting started in Maynard, and I went to the first meeting and learned about running shoes. I went to a local sports store and bought a pair of Etonic Trans Am shoes. Etonic was a Massachusetts company, and their shoes were in all the Massachusetts stores. Boy, running was different with those shoes compared to my army boots. Today the Trans Am are considered walking shoes, but back then they were the latest in running shoes.I soon discovered that I had a problem with the shoes, because the heel on my right foot compressed until the outside thickness was about 1/4 inch less than the inside thickness. This put a terrific torque on my ankle, but I didn't suffer any injuries from it. The cause of the compression was a skeleton defect that I had at birth -- I walk on the outside of my right foot. Even today, I can sit on a chair with my heels on the floor and my toes sticking up, and I can see a tilt in my foot. I was a supinator, although the cause was my skeleton defect rather than a high, stiff arch that is usually associated with supination (I have a medium arch, but my joints are very stiff. They were described by a bone specialist as the opposite of double joints). I didn't realize at the time that my skeleton defect was the cause of the compression.In 1981, I ran my first marathon in Vermont, called the Green Mountain Marathon. I was concerned about the compression of the right heel, and I used my electric glue gun to rebuild the heel back to normal height. Boy, was that a mistake, because all that glue had no cushioning at all. I developed a pain in my right quad that would appear after about 45 minutes running. The pain didn't get worse or change location, so I ignored it. I even ran a marathon with it. After a few weeks of experimenting, I discovered that the pain was due to my shoe and all that glue. I got new shoes, and the pain was gone. I needed new shoes, anyway, because I had 1000 miles on them.One day I called Etonic and asked them what shoes I should use for my supination. They said to use the Stability Pro shoe that was designed for pronators. I said I supinate, and the man said they would help with that, too. By then, the Etonic running shoe market was falling apart, so I got mine via mail (the Internet wasn't invented by Al Gore yet). Hey, no more heel compression, great! I used those shoes until about a year ago when I decided to try something with newer technology and switched to LOCO shoes and the MOJO stability shoe.Now, back to this past weekend. After I put 500 miles on my shoes, I switch to a new pair and use the old ones for my walking shoes. I noticed a few days ago that my old walking shoes did have a small amount of compression in the right heel, and I decided to search for a shoe that wouldn't compress. I learned from my reading that there are three types of shoes, motion control, stability, and neutral. Motion control shoes are for severe pronators and stability shoes are for moderate pronators. Both shoes are built to resist the natural roll of the pronator's foot past the center of the shoe and onto the inside edge of the shoe. That is, they \"push\" the foot towards the outside of the shoe. After I read that, I realized that the stability shoes I had been wearing for 20 years were pushing my foot toward the outside even though my foot was already on the outside. That is, my shoes were doing the opposite of what they should have been doing! Then I read that supinators should use a neutral shoe that would let the foot move toward the center. I said a quick prayer of thanks that my wrong shoes during the past 20 years hadn't led to injury.One question that needs to be answered is, \"Why did my stability shoes remove almost all of the compression of the heel?\" For 20 years, I thought the answer was because they were stability shoes designed to stabilize the foot. I did wonder why shoes built to help pronators would help supinators, but I didn't think about that much and just accepted on faith that they would help. I now realize that the reason is probably because the stability shoes had better material in the heel, material that was less subject to compression, that is, newer technology.I haven't purchased a neutral shoe yet, but I will try one and will report the results in this blog."},

For most of the run, I ran a 10:30 pace plus or minus a bit. During the last half mile, I was getting tired and slowed to a 11:00 pace. I felt fine during most of the run. I ran just before sundown, and the temperature had dropped from a high of 85 (F) to about the mid 70s (F) when I ran. I had had a pretty busy day before my run, including mowing my lawns and keeping 5 grand children busy with activities. I did sneak in two short naps, though :)I noticed while driving to/from my run that the three canals I pass have water. Last year they didn't get water until the middle of May. We've had a warm spring with more runoff of water than is normal for an April, and I guess the canal companies decided the farmers would need the water earlier."},

{"title": "How to get used to a faster comfortable pace?", "date": "Monday, April 23, 2007", "text": "My August 2006 half-marathon and the one I just finished on April 21, 2007 have one trait in common. I ran a pace about a minute and a half faster than my training runs for 8-9 miles, and then I bonked and had to slow down; my body wasn't used to that fast pace. However, during the 8-9 miles, I felt comfortable. I need to extend that comfortable feeling out to 13.1 miles and then (later on) to 14 or 15 miles.I've been thinking about the best way to become comfortable with the faster pace. It seems I have two options.1. Continue doing what I've done for the past six months. Run 30-33 miles/week and slowly increase my speed. That would probably give me a small improvement by October similar to the one I had in the race yesterday.2. Immediately increase my comfortable pace to 10:30 and decrease all of my distances to be less than 8 or 9 miles. Hopefully, I could do this without a lot of time involved, because that is the distance I felt comfortable with in both half-marathons. I would still run four times per week (2 rest runs, a medium run, and a long run), and I would slowly increase my medium and long runs to the distances they are now. That is, I would start with runs of 5, 5, 8, 8 (26 miles per week), and I would slowly increase my medium run to 10 miles and my long run to 13 miles. If I couldn't handle the 26 mpw and the faster pace, I would reduce the runs to what ever level I could handle.Option 1 is probably the safest option, but it would give the smallest improvement in the six months between now and the World Senior Games in October. Option 2 would likely give a bigger improvement in October, but it would probably put more stress on my body. I'm thinking I'll experiment with option 2 and see how it goes. If I have difficulty with it, I can always switch to option 1. I'll be my normal conservative self during these tests so I don't become injured.I was just reading a web site on nutrition, and it (the author was a RN and a nutritionist) said that for runs longer than an hour, one should eat a snack during the run. I brought an e-Gel pack to take during the run, but I forgot to remove it from my jacket before I put the jacket in a gear-bag for transport to the finish. I thus ran the full distance on energy from my supper. Devine Sports did have snacks available at the start, but I didn't take any. I also just read an article by Nancy Clark that said that runners do better if they eat a 400 calorie breakfast 3-4 hours before a race rather than relying on supper 10-14 hours before the race as the last meal. After I get my comfortable pace up to 10:30, I'll experiment with eating snacks while I run. I've done a little experimenting with this at my slower pace, and my stomach handled the food ok.I always have trouble sleeping before an important event early in the morning, but the night before the race was the worst trouble I've ever had. I got to bed later than I wanted, and after two hours I woke up and couldn't sleep soundly after that. When my alarm went off, I got up and started gathering my things together. My wife came down and asked, \"Why are you up so early?\" I looked at my watch and saw that I had gotten up an hour early. A few days ago, we had a power glitch, and I had to reset the time on the clock, and I set it an hour early. So, I had about three hours of sleep instead of the four I thought I was getting.Bruce mentioned earlier in the evening at the Expo that the most important night for sleep is two nights before the race, because it takes a day for our bodies to respond to lack of sleep. I had noticed this with my wakeup heart rate measurements -- lack of sleep frequently didn't affect my resting heart rate for two days.I felt energetic during the first nine miles of the race, and then I began to feel tired. I have no way of knowing if my lack of sleep increased my tiredness during the race, but it probably did. I think an adrenalin rush was involved, because there have been times when I didn't get enough sleep and felt very tired when I woke up."},
{"title": "I set a new Personal Best in the Salt Lake City Half-Marathon", "date": "Saturday, April 21, 2007", "text": "I had a good race. I set a new PB by 55 seconds with a time of 2:20:21. My time in August 2006 was 2:21:16. That 55 seconds may not seem like much of an increase, but when you include the time spent in walking breaks, my performance today was even better than the 55 seconds. In 2006, starting with mile 9, I took one-minute walking breaks every mile, 4 minutes spent walking. Today I took 30-second breaks every half-mile, 12 minutes spent walking. My speed today was fast enough to get the 55 second PB and to overcome the approximately 4 minutes lost due to having more walking breaks today. I credit the walking breaks with my completing the race today with a new PB and with my feeling fine during and after the race.Here are my mile splits.Mile   1: 10:48Mile   2: 10:36Mile   3: 10:30Mile   4:    9:31   (down a long hill.

You can see that during the last 4 miles, I became tired. I've been running weekly 13 mile long runs for about a year at a pace of 11:30 - 12:15 or so. I'm not used to running a pace of 10:30 or so, and that pace took its toll. My next half-marathon will be in October at the World Senior Games in St. George, Utah, and I have six months to get used to the faster pace, as well as to keep my ability to run 13.1 miles.Considering everything, I'm very satisfied with my performance this morning. I went out and maintained a pace a bit too fast, but I probably had a higher average speed than I would have had if I had gone out 15 seconds or so slower.As soon as I can find the results online, I'll post my ranking in my age group of 70-75. If I had run this half last year, my time last August and today would have put me in second place.I think I must look pretty old, because a lot of runners, as they passed me, told me to keep it up, that I was an inspiration to all of them. One girl told me that when she is 71 she hopes she can still walk, much less run.The last half mile of the race was through the Gateway shopping plaza. Spectators were lined up solid on both sides cheering us on. That was nice of them to do that! I've always run smaller races, and I enjoyed the excitement, noise, and adrenalin rushes of this bigger race.The weather was almost perfect! Temperature in the low to mid 40s (F), cloudy, no wind, low humidity, and no rain.Here are two pictures from the race. In the lower picture are Ben my friend from Westminster College in Salt Lake, me, and my friend Bruce from Las Vegas.Four or five weeks ago I reported that I was having problems with my left foot. No pain and not an injury -- just a \"weak\" feeling like I used to have before I started running when I would spend hours on a Saturday doing yard work. I took a three-week taper before the half-marathon instead of my normal two-week taper to give my foot extra rest.In starting the race this morning, I was concerned, because the \"weak\" feeling came after 8 or 9 miles and the race was 13.1 miles. However, I had no problems with my foot during the half-marathon. My foot felt strong and normal. I'm grateful for the extra rest I gave my foot, and I'm grateful for the Ruta and Rhus Tox homeopathy remedies that I took for the three weeks. And, most of all, I'm grateful for blessings from the Lord that I had the opportunity to run the race and finish it with no mishaps."},

Tomorrow I will run for 15 minutes to warm up, and then I'll take two days of rest. At 7:00 on Saturday, the race will begin...Last week I mentioned in this blog that the Jordan River had eaten under the Parkway trail and that the damaged area was blocked off. When I got there this morning, the whole trail was marked off. Riverton City had cut a temporary dirt path around the damage and had a big concrete barrier blocking the trail to the damage. On my way back, I walked up to the damage to see how bad it was -- pretty bad. The damaged area is about 100 yards across, and the river has cut away the bank up to the middle of the trail. I'm expecting the city to make the temporary trail permanent. We'll see....During my run, my turn-around was at the tunnel under 126th South. For the past couple of months, the river has flooded the path and has gone part way up the bank. This morning, the water level was back to normal and the path was clear. The tunnel under 106th South is still flooded, however. That water comes up through a drain, and the ground has to dry out enough that the water in the tunnel can go down through the drain and soak into the river."},

Next week, my Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday runs will be 15 minutes, 15 minutes, and 30 minutes, respectively. I'll rest Thursday and Friday and will run the race on Saturday.During my run this morning, I came upon a stretch of path that is next to the edge of the river bank. The bank was marked off with yellow tape to keep people from getting close to the edge. When I got to the end of the tape, I looked back and could see that the water had eroded under the path, and the asphalt was sticking out over the water. If a person walked on that portion of the path, they could cause the path to crumble, and they would fall 2 or 3 feet into the water. I don't know how the city of Riverton will fix the path. My guess is that they will curve the path away from the bank.Yesterday I became very dehydrated, and I was up a lot during the night with heartburn trying to figure out what my problem was. When I was standing, I felt ok, but when I lay down the heartburn came back. I ended up sitting in a chair trying to snooze.When my body needs water, I become thirsty like most people do. If I still don't drink enough water, my body advances from thirst to heartburn. That is, after I've felt thirsty, my dehydration will cause me to have heartburn. I drank very little yesterday and didn't realize that I had become dehydrated. About two hours after I went to bed, I woke up with bad heartburn. My normal treatment for heartburn is to drink aloe vera in a great tasting drink, but that didn't help. I tried it two more times with no success. I finally realized the heartburn was caused by my being dehydrated. I drank two or three glasses of water and went to bed and slept fine. I've made sure that I drank sufficient water today, and I feel fine.I should have realized sooner that the heartburn was caused by dehydration, but I don't get heartburn very often, and it took me a while to figure it out.General recommendations for runners are to drink when you feel thirsty. And, drink enough fluid that your urine is either clear or has a slight color. Be careful, though, that you don't drink too much water. Typically, a person needs 6-8 glasses per day, but that varies with the individual. Some doctors say that should be 6-8 glasses of water, while other doctors say it can be any fluid."},

The tunnel is still flooded, but if the water decreases as much in the coming week as it did this week, I'll be able to use the tunnel during my run.

{"title": "Homeopathy and my feet", "date": "Sunday, March 25, 2007", "text": "In a previous post I described how I use homeopathy when I have a cold. I thought I'd describe how I use homeopathy for problems with my feet. This will also explain how I became introduced to homeopathy. If you're not interested in homeopathy, feel free to skip this post.I lived in Massachusetts for 17 years, and I did a lot of hiking in Massachusetts and New Hampshire during the 12 years that I was a Scoutmaster. New England has 48 peaks that are above 4000 feet elevation, and it is a tradition, known as peak bagging, among many hikers to climb those peaks. In my 17 years, I climbed two of them, the highest (Mt. Washington, 6288 feet) and the lowest (Mt. Tecumseh, 4003 feet). My two climbs of Washington were with my scout troop, and my climb of Tecumseh was with my family. On our way down Tecumseh, my kids ran down the trail, and my youngest daughter sprained her ankle. I did the traditional first-aid on her foot (RICE), but it took her about a month to recover from that sprain.Not too long after my daughter's sprain, one of my scouts (Jeff) sprained his ankle, and a week later he was running around as if nothing had happened. I asked his mother why Jeff had such a quick recovery, and she introduced me to homeopathic remedies. She explained that she gave three remedies to Jeff. First was Arnica Montana, which should be given for any injury to help the body overcome shock. Next was Ruta Graveolens which helps the tendons heal. Third was Rhus Tox which helps the muscles heal. I was impressed with the difference in healing between my daughter and Jeff, especially since they were about the same age.I was also interested in Rhus Tox, because I was leaving in a week for a week-long backpacking trip in the White Mountains of New Hampshire that would cover 50 miles of hiking and our first hike of Mt. Washington. This was during the time when, even though I was running, I was still having a lot of pain in my feet after several hours of Saturday yard work on my feet. That pain was peculiar, because it was reduced by movement. When I would first get up on Sunday morning, my feet would be very stiff and painful, but after walking around for a few minutes, the stiffness would go away and the pain was reduced. Jeff's mother suggested that I take Rhus Tox with me, because it is helpful when movement reduced stiffness and pain. I thought, \"It's worth a try\", and I put Rhus Tox in my backpack and took it during the week.I had no problems at all with my feet during that week. I hiked 50 miles, climbed Mt. Washington 1 1/2 times (the half-climb was the evening before our full climb so I could check out the trail. The peak is 3500 feet [elevation change] above the trail head). No problems at all...until...until Saturday, the eighth and last day of our week. We were hiking 7 miles back to our cars and my feet began to hurt. I had run out of Rhus Tox on Thursday, and after two days of hiking without the remedy, my pain returned. After that trip, I was a confirmed believer in homeopathy. I've used Rhus Tox many times when I have stiff feet after several hours of being on my feet, and I believe it is helpful.Ok, now back to my current problem of sore feet after 8 or so miles of running. I've explained that I believe the problem is due to my running fewer miles after stopping my marathon training while in Massachusetts, and my running even fewer miles per week after moving to Utah 14 years ago. For the past 2 1/2 years, after I recovered from my auto accident in August 2004, I've had an intense running program in which I started my post-accident running with 1/8 mile and two years later ran the Great Salt Lake Half Marathon. That running put a lot of stress on my 70+ year old body. That stress was increased by a double hernia operation, 10 big skin cancer surgeries (including several skin grafts, one with pig skin), and surgery to remove my gall bladder. Since that half marathon, I've been running 30-33 miles/per week, including fartleks and intervals and hill workouts. It has been a stressful 2 1/2 years, and apparently my foot muscles deteriorated during my years of reduced running and can't fully handle the intensity of my current training. My body needs more time to rebuild the muscles.I still hope to run the Salt Lake City Half Marathon on April 21, but I won't be able to finish it very well if I continue to have the problem with my left foot. To give my feet time to begin healing, I'm planning on reducing the distances I run during the last two weeks of my training, and I will go through my normal two-week taper to the race. In addition, I'll be taking Arnica and Rhus Tox if I experience soreness again, and I'm taking daily dosages of Ruta between now and the race. I'm confident that my body will respond and strengthen the muscles in my feet, but I won't know for sure until race-day. As I've explained in the past, homeopathic remedies act as a catalyst to get my body to heal itself, and it all depends if I give my body enough rest and if my body does heal itself during the next four weeks.This problem seems like a biggie right now, but in a few weeks when I look back on it, it will just be a small burp in my life."},
{"title": "Another session of running hills", "date": "Saturday, March 24, 2007", "text": "I ran repeats up and down the big hill that I ran last week. It seemed like I had more strength this week, but I can't really tell. I did four repeats. I also ran that hill, and one other big hill on my 2-hour run on Wednesday. As I did last week, I ran a comfortable mile before and after to warm up and cool down.The Salt Lake City Half Marathon is four weeks from today on April 21. My body feels stronger now that it did four weeks before the Great Salt Lake Half Marathon last August. I've had good training during the past seven months since the GSL. My fastest tempo run before the GSL was 2:34. I did a 2:22 tempo run last fall (I haven't tried any tempo runs since then). I'm anxious to see if I can set a PB on April 21, and if so by how much. However, as I just explained in the post just before this one, I am concerned about my feet.When I lived in Phoenix, I had a lot of trouble with my feet. I would do several hours of Saturday yard work, and my feet would be so stiff and painful that I literally would have to crawl into the bathroom on Sunday morning. It would be Tuesday before my feet felt normal. I knew that I had a very stiff skeleton, so I went to a bone specialist. He said that the problem was weak muscles, and that I should do whatever exercise I wanted to strengthen the muscles. I started running.I ran for eight years before I ran my first marathon. By that time I was in Massachusetts. During that time, my feet muscles were strengthened, and I didn't have much trouble with my feet while running. I ran four marathons in two years, and then I stopped the marathons due to time constraints. I still continued to run during the next 10 years but not long distance. Around 20 miles/week with 5-7 mile runs.Then I ran even less when I moved to Utah 14 years ago. Probably 10 miles/week and short 1-2 mile runs. It was about four years ago that I decided to get serious with my running. By the time I started this blog in January 2004, I was up to 3-4 mile runs. I've had no problems with my feet during the past four years as I worked my distance up to 15 and then back to 13 mile long runs and 30-33 mile weeks. My feet felt fine when I ran the Great Salt Lake Half Marathon in August 2006, but I started feeling a slight weakness in my left foot during the fall of 2006. It was the same type of weakness that I'd felt in my feet back when I first started running. No pain, just a weak feeling as if my feet couldn't support my weight. During last fall and this winter, the weak feeling slowly became a bit more pronounced, but I ignored it. It finally reached the point last week and this week such that after eight miles, I could feel some pain in the foot. It was exactly the same feeling that I'd felt 30-40 years ago before I started running and during the first few years of my running.As I thought about it this week, after my 10-mile run on Thursday, I realized that after I stopped running marathons and reduced my mileage, especially after moving to Utah, my muscles in my feet had become weaker, and my old problem was returning. I realized that I had moved up in mileage too fast and that I needed to give my body more time to adjust to the stress of running. The reason I didn't run my first marathon until after eight years of running is that I ran about 20-24 miles per week for five or six years, and that allowed my muscles to become strong. This time, however, I went up to 33 miles/week and ran a half marathon after only two years of running after my auto accident in August 2004 in which I started running with 1/8 mile for my first run after the accident. So, I'm pretty sure that my problem is just that I've rushed too fast into distance running.The big question is what do I do in the future? I still hope to run the Salt Lake City Half Marathon on April 21 if my feet can handle that distance. I have two weeks of training plus my scheduled two-week taper, and during those four weeks, I will keep my mileage to 8 miles or less. I hopefully won't have a problem with that lower distance, and I will start the half marathon. Whether I finish the race, time will tell :) Whether I run the World Senior Games in October will depend on how my feet do during the summer. At least now I understand my problem and the need for more time to build up my feet. I'm hoping that my feet will make a pretty fast recovery since they  should be stronger than they were when I first started running. I look back on all of this and realize that I've been blessed; it could have turned out to be much worse."},
{"title": "My left foot is feeling \"weaker\" and is becoming painful", "date": "Thursday, March 22, 2007", "text": "In past posts, I've mentioned that my left foot felt \"weak\" after long runs. That condition is getting worse. The \"weak\" feeling starts at about 8 miles, and by 10 miles, my foot is starting to feel sore. As soon as I stop running, the pain stops. Right now, it has been about three hours since I finished my two-hour run, and my foot feels fine.I don't think my foot is injured, because the \"weak\" feeling is like the feeling I used to have in my feet after several hours of yard work. In fact, that \"weak\" feeling and soreness was the reason I started running. I think the problem is due to the fact that it has only been a year and a quarter since I went past 10 miles and on to 15 and then back to 13 miles. During that time, I've done a lot of fast runs and speed training. I think my body just needs more time to build strength.I am concerned about the half-marathon on April 21, because if my two-hour runs last week and today are indicators, I would have a hard time finishing the race. I'm going to wear an Ace bandage on my foot for the long runs between now and the race (including the race). After the race, I will need a month for recovery, and during that time I will just run comfortable runs with no speed work. Then I'll just have to run the summer and fall by \"ear\" so to speak.I measured my running cadence while doing a comfortable pace, an uphill run, and a downhill run. The cadences were 180, 176, and 192, respectively. I have a faster cadence that some runners I've talked with. My cadence and stride-length are natural to my body. I don't force them in any way.Trees have been planted in the new tree farm next to the Jordan River Parkway. I expected the trees to be 6-12 inches in height, but they are about 6 feet high. They are planted in plastic buckets that are in the ground. There is a large plastic pipe that runs along side the buckets with a small pipe taking water (and food?) to each tree."},

After the run, I did stretches for my calves, IT band, quads, and hams. Tonight, I'll do all my stretches like I did last night.Going back many years ago, I began having lower-back pain. Not a lot of pain but enough to cause me concern. It happened that at the same time, Runner's World had an article about a way of doing situps that put less stress on ones back than the traditional army way (my stretching page describes the way taught by the RW article and also the stretches I do for my lower back). I began doing those sit-ups and some stretches for my lower back. It took about a month, but the lower back pain went away and has never come back. I had been running for several years before the lower back pain came. This was a few years before I ran my four marathons.When I first moved to Utah 14 years ago, I did run but not a lot of miles, and I was careless in not doing my stretches regularly. My back muscles became so weak that I had a hard time getting up off the floor after finishing my sit-ups. I had to turn on my side and rise to my knees and then stand up. I realized what was happening to my back, and I become more regular in doing my sit-ups and back stretches. As before, it took some time, several months, to get a strong back. Now, even with my old body, I have no lower back pain and I can rise up from the floor and stand on my feet.When I got home from my run, I took of my running shoes and realized that I had used my walking shoes for the run :) After I've used a pair of running shoes for 17 weeks, I retire them from running and use them for walking shoes. Thus, my walking shoes are the same brand/model as my running shoes."},
{"title": "My Monday hour-long rest run went well", "date": "Monday, March 19, 2007", "text": "I ran an enjoyable run on the Parkway and mixed trash-pickup with my running. Nothing eventful happened; just a nice run.For all of my running career (34 years), I've done my stretches before I run. When I started running, everyone stretched before they ran. However, since then it has become a controversy whether one should stretch before or after. I've been thinking about switching for quite a while, and after participating in a discussion on stretching in the running.about.com forum, I've decided to try stretching after I run. I will do more walking to warm up better before I run.Some runners believe that stretching before a run helps the muscles to become loose and warm, ready to propel the runner. Other runners, however, claim that research shows that there is no advantage to stretching before a run. I haven't seen good test results about that, so I don't know if those claims about research are true.However, my primary reason for stretching is to strengthen my muscles, and I think that that can be done anytime during the day. So, I thought I'd try stretching after and see how it goes. Today was my first day to stretch after."},

This morning, the owner of the house was in his garage, so I stopped and asked him where the water was coming from.He said that it was ground water and the pumping was necessary to prevent the water from going in his basement. He said that each spring the water people open the flood gates at Utah Lake and let more water into the Jordan River. That causes the ground water to rise, and the pumping keeps it from going into his basement. He said he has to pump until mid May. His house is in the flood plain for the river.The flood gates remain open until the spring runoff from melting snow has dissipated, thus keeping the lake and its shore houses from flooding."},

I usually only encounter the first of the two big hills that I encounter on my 2 1/2 hour run.

I just tried to maintain my comfortable pace, and I think I did do that.My urine when I got home was a darker color than I would like, so I need to drink more water. Today I drank about 30 ounces. The temperature was in the mid 70s (F).On Saturday I want to do hill repeats on the lower portion of the first big hill. That portion is about 1/4 mile long and not awfully steep. I should be able to do 4 or 5 repeats, both up and down with a minute of jogging at the bottom for recovery."},
{"title": "Another enjoyable one-hour rest run & litter pickup", "date": "Tuesday, March 13, 2007", "text": "My run this morning was nice. I took it easy, picked up a lot of litter (the pathway is looking pretty nice, now)and enjoyed myself. The temperature was in the high 50s (F) (I was out a couple of hours earlier than yesterday), the sky was sunny, the snow covered mountains were beautiful, and it was another great day to be outside.Tomorrow is South Jordan, Riverton, and beyond...Yesterday, when I looked at the Jordan River as it goes through the tunnel under 106th South, I could tell that the level of the water is going down slightly. Some kids have thrown rocks into the water, and those rocks give me a way to gage the depth of the water. When I looked at the water this morning, I could see that it had gone down about an inch since yesterday. Later, as I ran past the place where I can walk to the edge of the water, I stopped to look at the water, and I could tell that it had gone down about an inch since yesterday. When I do my medium run tomorrow, I'll be able to look at the river as it goes through the tunnel at 126th South.We've had warm weather for a few days with no rain, so having the water level decrease is to be expected. However, there is an awfully lot of snow in the mountains (Snowbird Ski Resort currently has 7 feet 2 inches), and as that snow melts some of the water will drain into the Jordan River. Thus, the river will probably remain high for another 4-6 weeks or longer.During the past couple of weeks, I've seen workman preparing an area right next to the parkway path. I had speculated that they city might be putting in more picnic areas since there was no sign of a hole being dug for a basement or for footings. This area is next to a large picnic area that extends for about a half mile south of 106th South.When I ran past that area this morning, there were three men watching the work, and I stopped to talk with them. It turned out they are city employees, and they told me the city is putting a tree farm to provide trees at less cost to the taxpayers when the trees are needed to line city streets. The men didn't say how big the trees would be, but I assume the trees will be planted as 6 or so inch seedlings and will be transplanted when they are several feet tall. They will make a nice border for a few hundred feet of the parkway."},

Eventually, the parkway will go all the way from the Point of the Mountain (southern edge of the Salt Lake Valley) north to the Salt Lake airport, and eventually into Davis County."},

I ran at a comfortable pace and enjoyed the beautiful day! The temperature was in the mid 70s, and it was too hot for running :) I'll have to take extra water with me on Wednesday for my two-hour run. I normally drink 20 oz of water on that run, mainly because I swallow an e-Gel pack, and that is the amount of water specified by the manufacturer of e-Gel. I think on Wednesday I'll take 32 oz. so I'll have some water to buffer the higher temperature. Yes, Spring is here!I normally don't run hills on my Monday and Tuesday rest runs. However, because the tunnels under 106 South and 126 South are flooded, I'm running a shorter path back and forth. Since I'll be running hills on Saturday, I decided to run today the big hill that I run on Wednesday. I did pretty good going up. I could have made it to the top, but I stopped about 200 feet short of the top and walked the rest of the way.After walking around for a couple of minutes to recover form the uphill run, I ran 1/4 mile down the hill. I felt pretty good going down, and I went down at a faster pace than the pace I was using today. This is important training, because the Salt Lake City half-marathon has a steep downhill stretch that is about 0.6 miles long, followed by a 0.8 mile stretch that is also downhill but not as steep. The two stretches, combined, will take the racers from 27th East to 14th East via 21st South. I want to be ready for that downhill run! Downhills are hard on ones legs."},

{"title": "Homeopathy and colds", "date": "Friday, March 09, 2007", "text": "If you've read much in my blog, you realize that I like the outdoors, natural things, animals, birds. One of the reasons I enjoy running is because it gets me outside where I become part of nature.My enjoyment of natural things extends to the healing of colds. I use homeopathic remedies instead of traditional medicine. For example, I haven't had an aspirin in 40 years, maybe longer. Except for the first 24 hours or so after serious surgery, I don't take \"pain killers\". In a way, my use of homeopathic remedies is part of my running since my health is part of my running. If you're not interested in reading about homeopathy, feel free to skip the rest of this post.Homeopathic remedies aren't drugs. They don't heal me. They don't dull my nerves so I feel less pain. They don't have side effects. They can be given to small children. They act like a catalyst and get my body to heal itself.My colds have two phases. First is the \"thin mucus\" phase. That is followed by the \"thick mucus\" phase. The remedies I take for a cold depend on the phase I'm in. All of the remedies I use are 30X, where 30X refers to the potency of the remedy. When living in Massachusetts I used 30C, which is more potent, but here in Utah the health food stores don't carry 30C. The stores do carry 6X, but I use the more potent 30X.Thin-Mucus PhaseDuring the first 24 hours of a cold, I'll take 1 tablet of Aconitum Napellus every 3 or 4 hours. During the remainder of this phase, I'll take 1 tablet of Euphrasia AND 1 tablet of Allium Cepa every 3 or 4 hours.Thick-Music PhaseOnce my cold progresses to the thick, yellowish phase, I switch to 1 tablet of Pulsatilla AND 1 tablet of Hepar Sulph every 3 or 4 hours.That's it. These remedies do wonders with my colds.As a side note, homeopathic remedies are very diluted, and I have to be careful to not pollute them with food residues in my mouth or body grease from my fingers. I never touch the tablets. I pour one tablet into the bottle lid and then drop it into my mouth. I use my tongue to push the tablet under my tongue and then let it dissolve (5-10 seconds). I take them 15 minutes before I eat or brush my teeth, or one hour after I've done those things.The reason that I use different remedies in each of the two phases is that homeopathic remedies are used to treat symptoms not ailments. The thin or thick mucus is a symptom. The cold is the ailment. The remedies I mentioned can be used for other ailments as well as for colds. For example, when my daughter, Tova, was young, she had an aversion to fat -- she would suffer serious nausea when she ate foods containing fat. When she was in middle school and high school and would go on a school trip, she took Pulsatilla with her, and that allowed her to eat fast foods with no nausea. By the time she entered college, she had grown out of that aversion.Most runners get an occasional cold, and they wonder if they should run through the cold or take a day or two of rest. Each runner has to answer that question, because we all have different bodies and thus different energy-levels and different immune systems. Here are a few things to consider.If a person has a strong immune system, the person probably won't get colds, because running, when done properly, should strengthen our immune systems. In fact, we can usually consider a cold as a sign from our body that we're doing something wrong, such as getting insufficient sleep, having too much stress in our lives, getting inadequate nutrition, or pushing ourselves too much in our training. I have a cold right now because I pushed myself too much in my two-hour run on Wednesday.When we have a cold, we may take meds to help us breath, to suppress the symptoms of the cold so we can go into public activities and not cough and sneeze a lot, but those meds don't cure the cold. Only our body can cure the cold, and to do that our body must have enough energy to overcome the cold. Thus, getting rest, liquids, and proper nutrition when we have a cold will help our body have the energy it needs.Should you run through a cold? My answer is \"yes\" if you feel pretty good and have a relatively high energy-level. My answer is \"no\" if you feel tired, down in the dumps, so to speak. When I was younger, I used to run through colds. Now that I'm older, I usually don't run in the \"thin mucus\" stage but will run in the \"thick mucus\" stage if I feel pretty good. I only get one or two colds per year, and they are usually from over training, so I don't have to worry much about running or resting during a cold. I know that over training is likely the culprit, and rest is the proper treatment for recovering from over training as well as from the cold."},
{"title": "Yesterday's run was a bit too \"great\"", "date": "Thursday, March 08, 2007", "text": "Yesterday my body wanted to run faster, and I let it go for about 3 miles of pretty fast (for me) running. During the evening my nose started dripping, and I didn't sleep very well because my body was overly tired. My fastest pace for a 1/4 mile split was 10:31, and I probably should have limited it to 11 minutes. Since my rest runs have been around 12 minutes, an 11 minute pace would still have been a respectable pace.Getting a cold is a common result when I push myself too much. I've always been grateful that my body comes down with a cold instead of an injury when I do too much. Here is a status report on how I feel this morning. My nose isn't dripping. My legs feel fine. My body feels fine but tired. So, it looks like I'll survive. This evening I'll post an addendum to this post to document how my body is reacting to yesterday's run.But, I really did enjoy yesterday's run!Later in the evening: my nose started dripping soon after I made this post, and it has been dripping all day. I had a half hour nap in the afternoon, and I'm heading for bed now to get a good 7+ hours.Next day: my nose hasn't been dripping since I got up this morning, about two hours ago. I feel pretty good, and I may go out for an easy run later today."},
{"title": "Wow, I had a really great run today!", "date": "Wednesday, March 07, 2007", "text": "The two-hour run I made to day was one of the best I've had in quite a while. It took me about 3 miles to get warmed up, but then my body wanted some speed and I just let it go. I had my Garmin GPS set for 1/4 mile splits, and my fastest split was 10:31. I had quite a few around 11:00 - 11:30 and quite a few rest splits around 12:00 - 12:30. I slowed to a 13 or 14 minute pace for the last 20 minutes so my body could cool down.The temperature was in the low 60s, the air was clear, and it was a beautiful spring day.Every week when I run through the tunnel at 126th South, I can tell that the river is rising. Today, the river was at the highest level that I've seen during the past year. The path through the tunnel is usually only a few inches above the level of the water in the river, and the path was flooded soon after the river began to rise. The ground on the far side of the path rises up to the footing for the highway bridge with a slope about 20% over a horizontal distance from the river to the footing of about 12-15 feet. Today, when I reached the tunnel, I could see that the water had moved about five feet toward the footing, and at the far end of the tunnel, that is closer to the river, the water was about a foot away from the footing.The ski resort at Snow Bird currently has over 8 feet of snow, and as that snow melts, a lot of water will go into the river via several creeks that drain the mountains. That plus any spring rains that we get have the potential to cause flooding.Yesterday, when I ran through the picnic area south of 106th South, at a spot where the path is only about 15 feet from the river, I stopped to see how far the water was below the bank. It was about 18 - 24 inches below. If the river overflows its banks, the path will be covered, and I'll have to go back to the canal road for my running. Worse than that, there are several large office buildings and a restaurant that aren't far from the river, and they might be flooded. I don't know why people build in flood plains. About a mile downstream, there are houses being built in the flood plain.When I lived in Massachusetts, there was a beautiful spot on Rt. 119 in Pepperell that was on the bank of the Nashua River. Some guy wanted to build a restaurant there. It would have been a beautiful spot for his business. But, the town said \"no\" because that area would be flooded in a serious flood that could occur every 100 years or so.  As fate would have it, that area was flooded about two years later. The guy was probably glad he hadn't built there."},

{"title": "Ran another test on my Polar heart-rate monitor", "date": "Monday, March 05, 2007", "text": "Last Saturday evening I read the users booklet for my Polar heart-rate monitor and discovered that it saves the highest and lowest heart-rate during a workout session. So, this morning I ran a test to compare the reading on the monitor with the maximum value saved. I've been suspicious that the value displayed is an average of some kind, and if so, that value might be less than the maximum heart rate that I achieved during the workout. After running 3/4 mile warm-up at a heart rate of about 90, I ran a half mile split at a pretty fast pace. When I finished the half mile, the monitor gave a value of 112 (my 80% of max is 119). I then checked the maximum value that was saved, and it was also 112. Thus, if any averaging is done, it is probably a moving average over the last few readings, which are taken at a rate of some fraction of a second. The monitor display is uppdated every second or so, and since only a few readings are probably used in the averaging, the averaged result would likely be the same as the displayed value. I thus concluded that the HR monitor can be trusted to give a good value of my HR while running. I did this, because some runners have had problems getting good values from their HR monitors.I then ran a test on the \"10-second measurement\" that I described on Saturday. I ran a rest pace and used the HR monitor to see how much my heart slowed down in the first 10 seconds after I stopped (my heart slowed 2 beats). I then ran the rest pace until my HR stabilized, and then I stopped and manually counted the beats for 10 seconds. I added 2 to that value to compensate for my heart slowing down. I compared that value with my HR rate as measured by the monitor divided by 6, and the two values were the same.I finished my workout with a 2-mile run at a comfortable pace yielding a heart rate of 90. The temperature during my workout was in the mid 50s (F). A really great spring day!"},
{"title": "Great intervals today", "date": "Saturday, March 03, 2007", "text": "I went to the track at the local high school and ran intervals. My hams and legs felt fine! I think I ran about the same pace as last week.I ran two splits at 1/2 lap (1/8 mile) each. Then I ran a split at 1/4 mile, and I ended my planned splits with two more at 1/8 mile each. My recovery between splits was 1 1/2 laps or 3/8 mile. I felt fine during the intervals. To reduce the stress on my knees from running a small loop, I reversed my direction after the 3rd split.I wore my wife's HR monitor. At the end of a 1/8 mile, my HR was only up to 101 68% of max). At the end of the 1/4 mile it was up to 106 (71%). It looks like I'd have to run a much longer lap to get close to 80%. Next week I'll wear my GPA so I'll know the pace I'm using.The first question that came to me when I saw my HR at the end of the first split was whether the monitor was giving accurate values or not. When I'm sitting quietly, the monitor is within 1 beat of my HR taken manually. Because of this, I assume the monitor was giving good readings. I know I have very good oxygen capacity, and that probably is why my HR didn't go very high at the end of the splits. I was running pretty fast, but I wasn't breathing heavily. Next week will be my last session for intervals. I want to run hills for three weeks, followed by a 13 mile long run the next week, and then a two-week taper to the race on April 21. The course for the Salt Lake City half-marathon has a 2/3 mile steep descent off the east bench (27th East to 23rd East), as well as a few small hills, and I want to train for them."},
{"title": "10-second heart rate", "date": "Saturday, March 03, 2007", "text": "One of the traditional ways of measuring heart rate while you're running when you don't have a heart-rate monitor is to stop and measure your pulse for 10 seconds and then multiply that value by 6. This method, however, is not very accurate, because there will be a small error in the 10-second value -- as soon as you stop, your heart-rate begins to decrease, and that small error is multiplied by 6. For example, a one-beat error in your measurement would mean that your resulting heart-rate could be anywhere in the range from 6 beats too low up to 6 beats too high.Usually, when we're running, we aren't interested in a precise value, just in an approximate number. For example, you might want your heart-rate during a comfortable or resting run to be 70% of maximum. Rather than use the inaccurate method described above, let's use a more accurate procedure by reversing the procedure given above.1. Calculate your maximum heart-rate as 220 - your age. I'm 71, so my max is 149.2. Multiply your maximum by the %max as a decimal value between 0 and 1. For 70% I would multiply by 0.7 and get 104.3. Divide that heart-rate value by 6. I would divide 104 by 6 and get 17.That value is my 10-second HR for 70% of my maximum. Now, I can stop running and measure my 10-second heart-rate. If I'm close to that value I would know I was running close to my 70% goal. This method eliminates the X6 factor and gives an approximation or \"ball park\" value, which generally is good enough for recreational runners. If you are more serious in your running, you might consider getting a heart-rate monitor."},

I took 30-second walking breaks every half mile, and the slight tightness in my right ham disappeared as I walked during the first break and then returned as I went back to my rest pace. I did a lot of stretching of my hams during the day, and before I left home and again before I started the run, I felt both hams, and they both felt about the same.

The temperature during my run was in the mid 30s (F).I'm still planning to run intervals at the high school track on Saturday. However, I will reduce the intensity of the intervals to give my body more time to adjust to the stress of the speed workout. Last fall I ran just as fast as I did on Saturday and didn't have any problems. Apparently, my winter of LSD reduced the ability of my body to handle the stress of faster running.On Saturday I will do the following.1. Do my warm-up and warm-down jogs for one mile instead of the half-mile that I used on Saturday.2. Only do three or four splits. I didn't count them, but I think I did 6 or 7 splits last Saturday.3. Reduce each split from a half-mile to a quarter-mile.4. Keep my recovery jog/walk at a half mile.5. If I feel that my body isn't handling the splits very well, I will increase the recovery.6.

I also explained that the tightness seemed to go away during the evening, and I thought the problem was resolved.

The right ham, though, was hard. I had done a lot of stretching of my hams on Sunday and today, but I hadn't felt the hams and thus didn't realize that the right ham was still tight. Walking is a lot less stressful on my body than running, and the tight ham was able to handle walking but not running.I'm not very worried about the ham. There is no pain with it, only a feeling of tightness and hardness.

I drove to a high school and ran intervals on the track. I ran 5 or 6 quarter-mile intervals followed by a quarter-mile jog/walk recovery. My intervals were around 9:30 minutes/mile and my recovery jogs were around 11:15 minutes/mile.I had planned on doing one more interval after the one I was doing, when my right ham cramped. I immediately stopped and walked a short distance to a bleacher and stretched the ham. That helped but the ham was still tight, and it felt hard to my touch. I rubbed it for a minute and stretched it some more, but it was still hard. I walked the rest of the way around the track, stretched the ham some more, and then drove home. The ham wasn't sore and had no pain -- just a muscle cramp. I've been home for an hour, and the ham is still slightly hard but not nearly as much as it was when it first cramped.I wanted to wear my wife's heart-rate monitor during the intervals, but I forgot to take it. I'll use it next week. I don't want my HR to go past 119 (80% of my maximum which is approximately 149). I'd like my recovery HR to be about 89 (60%).Later: My ham feels fine now. After the hardness went away, my buttock was sore. I did a few buttock stretches and it immediately felt fine.I've been recording in this blog my wakeup HR for the past three years. I've decided that is enough data to be useful to anyone interested, and I'm not going to take time to record the value anymore. I will still use it as part of my decision each morning about how intense I should train during the day; I just won't put the value in this blog.

It is our light, not our darkness that most frightens us. We ask ourselves, Who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, fabulous? Actually, who are you not to be? You are a child of God. Your playing small does not serve the world. There is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won't feel insecure around you. We are all meant to shine, as children do. We were born to make manifest the glory of God that is within us. It's not just in some of us; it's in everyone. And as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same. As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others. -- Marianne WilliamsonWe are runners, and we are all successful within our own capabilities. But, so many of us are negative about our ourselves. We say that we can't succeed, that we can't set a new PB, that we can't run more than a few minutes. We put ourselves down so we can melt into the crowd. Instead, let us be who we are. Let us succeed in our running and in our lives and thus help others rise above the crowd and succeed in their lives.My wife and I watched a beautiful movie this evening, \"Akeelah and the Bee\".

However, we're getting a lot less snow than we used to. I remember that, when I was a kid in Southern Utah, having 18-24 inches of snow on the ground was normal, and temperatures as low as 10-20 degrees (F) below zero were normal. In 1948 or maybe 1949, we had a huge blizzard that covered the West. The Air Force had to drop bales of hay to cattle, and the snow drifts from the wind and from plowing highways were so high that cattle had to step over power and telephone wires. That was the last that I remember the large snow storms and the bitter cold temperatures. Now, we're lucky to get more than 6-10 inches of snow and temperatures down to zero."},

That means I had less than 24 hours between the two runs, and that translates to lest rest than I normally would have. My wakeup HR, though, was about normal at 48.When I got to the tunnel under 12600 South, it was flooded too. There is about a foot of water on the Parkway path. There is no problems getting through the tunnel, though, since there is a shoulder to the path that is above water. The 10600 South tunnel doesn't have shoulders, just concrete walls."},
{"title": "Time to change my shoes", "date": "Wednesday, February 21, 2007", "text": "I noticed a couple of weeks ago that the heel on my left running shoe is badly worn. I was hoping to get another month on those shoes, so I ignored the heel. However, my left foot started feeling weak during the run today, and I'm guessing that the worn heel may be contributing to that. The worn heel causes my foot to tilt backwards a bit. So, on Saturday I'll be wearing a new pair of LOCO Mojo shoes. I've mentioned the weakness in my left foot before, and it wouldn't surprise me if the tenderness was caused by the worn shoes. Ill fitting shoes or worn shoes are two of the common causes of injuries."},

When I started the run, the sun had set behind the Oquirrh mountains, and most of my run was in the dark. Because the tunnel under 10400 South is flooded, I parked south of the tunnel so I would have a clear path all the way to the tunnel under 12600 South. Of course, since my run was only an hour, I didn't go that far. In fact, I only ran about a mile south of my parking spot and half a mile north, and I looped that distance. There was plenty of light from nearby buildings and parking lots, and I could see fine.There was a 10 mph south wind blowing. When it was a tailwind, I felt fine and ran without a lot of effort. When it was a headwind, I had to exert more effort, and I felt  a little colder. The temperature was 36 (F), giving a wind chill of about 23 (F). I had my normal three layers that I wear in the winter.I enjoyed the run. The area was quiet and peaceful, and I only saw three other people. One was a runner and two were a young couple walking home or somewhere. My wakeup HR was 45 this morning.

I felt pretty good during the morning, but when I started to run, I could tell I was tired. I cut my run in half. I timed myself during the last mile. I finished the first half of the mile in 5:30. That was too fast for a rest run, so I slowed down and finished the full mile in 11:20. That was a pretty good pace for a rest run.I was in the house all morning, and it was nice to go out to run. It was a sunny but cool day, temperature in the high 30s (F), and the ground was covered with 3 inches of snow from last night. Very beautiful! The Parkway path was clear of snow, but there were wet spots all over. I was finished before the sun set, but anyone who walked the path after dark would have to be aware of black ice.The tunnel under 106th South is really flooded. It may be weeks before I get to use it again, depending on how much melting snow in the mountains runs into Utah Lake.

Last week, this tunnel was dry even though the tunnel under 126 South was flooded. There is a concrete wall bordering the river, and I thought that would keep the river water out of the path. I stopped and looked at the water, and then I saw it: there is a drain in the tunnel to remove rain water, and the river was high enough to flood that drain and come into the tunnel. The wall is about a foot thick, and most of the runners and walkers were walking on the wall to get around the flood. I don't have very good balance, so I jogged about a block to an intersection that has a traffic light. I didn't go as far as 126 South, but I expect that tunnel is really flooded."},
{"title": "My IT Bands are fine", "date": "Thursday, February 15, 2007", "text": "As explained in a previous post, my right IT Band was a little sore on Saturday evening and Sunday. I stretched it on Sunday, and it felt fine on Monday. I've continued to stretch it during the days since Sunday. Yesterday, I ran about 11 miles, and my IT Bands felt fine during the run and during the rest of Wednesday, and they feel fine this morning. The big test will be Saturday when I do more fartleks.I'm currently running four days/week: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Saturday. That gives me two rest days before my long run, speed training, or hills on Saturday. I look forward to and enjoy these rest days, because they help insure that I'm well rested and have a high energy level for Saturday. Sunday is also a rest day because that is my Sabbath, and that day helps insure that I'm well rested for my Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday runs. Without sufficient rest, I would not be able to perform at a high level, and I wouldn't enjoy my runs as much as I do. My body needs rest as well as exercise.Many runners have a problem with rest days. They are either so enthused about their running that they miss running on those days, or they have the misconception that their performance will deteriorate if they miss even one day of running. They don't seem to realize that our bodies react slowly -- slowly to improvements and slowly to degradations, and that one or two days without running will have little effect on their condition. Also, many of them are typical type A persons who are driven to compete with everything in life, and they have a hard time when they aren't in competition with something. Instead of a rest day, many runners get rest by doing a shorter, slower rest run. In fact, that is the basis for my Monday and Tuesday runs. They are about half the distance of my other two runs. So, I do rest runs and also take rest days. If a person listens to their body, they can decide on the best way to get rest.So, good morning rest days! You're welcome in my life!"},

I ran faster than last week and did about 11 miles. I didn't push to go faster; my body just did it on its own. I ran at about the same pace that I was running last Fall before the cold weather set in. The temperature was in the mid 40s (F), the sky was sunny with clouds, and I enjoyed the run! I had a 7-8 mph tailwind going out and a corresponding headwind coming back. The headwind took extra energy, and I was glad to make it back without having to take extra walking breaks.The Jordan River had a lot more water than it has been having, and the path going through the tunnel under 126 South was flooded. I had to walk on rocks that are between the path and the bridge foundation. Those rocks are on a upward slope, and the river would have a hard time flooding clear to the foundation. The tunnel under 106 South wasn't flooded, because the path in the tunnel has a concrete wall bordering the river.The water in the river is controlled by a pumping station on the north shore of Utah Lake, and it apparently put extra into the river to keep the lake from flooding. We've had a couple weeks of abnormally warm temperatures, and the heavy snow pack in the mountains is probably melting faster than normal."},

Timpanogus  on the south, past Lone Peak and Twin Peaks, past Mt. Olympus, and up to the small hills north of the capitol building. That is a distance of about 35 miles as the crow flys. The mountains were covered with a touch of snow from last night, and that white against the blue sky made for a beautiful site as I ran! It was really great to be out!Here is a view taken today of Twin Peaks in the Wasatch Range southeast of Salt Lake City.After my 3 miles of fartleks on Saturday, I felt fine through out the day. However, during the evening I started to feel a little bit of tenderness in my right leg, between my hip and my knee, and that soreness continued during Sunday. It was very minor, and I didn't notice it most of the time. At first I thought the problem might be with my quad, so I did extra quad stretches on Sunday. But then I recalled that the tenderness was on the outside edge of my leg and thus probably wasn't a quad problem. I remembered that the IT Band goes down the outside of my leg, and I decided it might be an ITB problem. I started doing my ITB exercise, and I could tell that the soreness was in the same place as the muscle being stretched. The soreness was gone this morning. I'm continuing the ITB exercise throughout this day and tomorrow and maybe on into the week.I first heard of the ITB about six months ago when it came up in discussions on running.about.com Even though I'd never had a problem with my ITB I decided to do a stretch for it, and for the past six months, I've been doing 20 seconds of ITB stretching before and 20 seconds after my runs (per leg). I think I'll double that. During my fartleks on Saturday, I did a few sprints for about 150 feet, and that burst of speed might have caused the soreness. IT Band pain is an overuse problem. Most of my fartleks were at slower paces.Later: I read about IT Band injuries on the Internet and learned that running too fast for ones body is one cause of the injuries. I just added a page to my running site about IT Band injuries.http://www.runninginjuryfree.org/itband.htmlNext day Tuesday February 13, 2007: I haven't had any soreness in the IT Band since Sunday evening. Stretching did the trick, and I caught it before it became an injury!I stopped for a minute to get a closer look at the small black ducks that I've mentioned in previous posts. They are smaller than a Mallard, and the body and head are pure black, and the bill is a bright white color. I'm really curious to know what kind of duck they are. Maybe someone will know and will post a reply with the info."},
{"title": "A nice hour of fartleks", "date": "Saturday, February 10, 2007", "text": "I did my speed training this morning. I ran for an hour on the Jordan River Parkway. I warmed up during the first mile and didn't run any fartleks. I then ran fartleks for the next 3 1/4 miles, and I ran the last mile without fartleks to recover and cool down (I did run a fartlek as a nice kick at the end of the run). I ended the run with a negative split by 10 seconds.I ran a variety of distances and speeds, and I did a slow recovery run between the fartleks. My recovery runs were slower than my rest pace during the first and last miles.I enjoyed being out. The sky was sunny with some clouds. The temperature was in the mid to high 40s (F). There was a 5 mph headwind going out and a tailwind coming back. I saw quite a few runners and walkers, and one kid on roller blades.My rest pace during my first mile and last mile was about 11:30. In fact I averaged that pace during the whole run (my recovery runs were slower but my fartleks were faster). That is the pace I was running at last fall before the cold weather set in. During the winter, my rest pace was 12:15 - 12:30. I don't think my speed training had much to do with my increase in pace since I've only been doing fartleks for three Saturdays. My guess is that it is probably the increase in temperature that we've had the past few days. Regardless, it's nice to be going a little faster but still running a comfortable rest pace.During the winter I ran a weekly 2 1/2 hour long run (12-13 miles) and a 2 hour medium run (9-10 miles). About 3 weeks ago, I converted the long run to a one-hour speed run, initially focusing on fartleks. I've been concerned that I might be losing my ability to run more than 10 miles, and I've decided to slowly add half an hour to the medium run. I'll add 5 minutes per week, and in 6 weeks that run will be up to 2 1/2 hours (12-13 miles). In doing this, I'll be adding stress to my body from two sources (speed and distance). I usually only add stress from one source at a time, but I'm hoping that the stress from the small 5 minute increment won't overload my body. We'll see."},

I assumed my being tired was due to the cadence drills that caused me to run 30-second spurts at a slightly faster pace. I didn't do drills in my two-hour run yesterday, and I feel pretty good today. This may be a confirmation that the drills were responsible for my being tired. However, for two Saturdays I ran fartleks during a one-hour run, and the fartleks were faster than my cadence drills. I felt fine after the fartleks. So, I'm not sure why I feel good today, just that I do.The March 2007 Runner's World has a Runner's Personality Quiz to help us discover what type of runner we are. The article gives four types of runners, and the quiz consists of 14 questions. Because the article is copyrighted, I won't give the questions, but here are the four categories. I took the quiz, and I am a Purist. I already knew that, but it was interesting to take the quiz and to have my self-analysis confirmed. The description given below for a Purist fits me to a \"T\".WarriorYou are motivated primarily by competition. How far and how fast you run is largely dictated by meeting the needs of your racing, and you think of running in terms of training. You would still run if you had to give up racing, but not nearly as intensely.PuristYour main motivation is running for running's sake--you like how it feels and how it makes you feel afterward. You might race, you might not. Running is part of your routine; it makes you feel complete. How far and how fast you run is based more on how you feel that day, your perceived needs, how nice of a day it is, and your surroundings. You hope to run a decent amount pretty much every day for the rest of your life.SocializerYou do a fair amount of racing, but you're drawn more by the social aspects of the events than your competitive drive. You're probably in a running club, and you're likely to volunteer at races.ExerciserYou run primarily for the quantifiable physical benefits, such as weight loss and disease protection. You think of running more as exercise than as something that's a natural part of the day and are likely to skip it if life's obstacles make it inconvenient. You likely to cross-train. You're not likely to participate in races, but you might sign up for one if it benefits a charitable cause.If you have a chance get the magazine, take the quiz and read the details that I left out of the four types of runners."},

Even though my wakeup HR was 54, I had more energy than Tuesday, and I ran for my planned two hours. The temperature when I began was in the low 60s (F), but it was in the mid 40s (F) when I finished after sundown with just a half hour left before darkness. I was glad to be done, because my only layer was a summer T-shirt, and as soon as the sun sent down, the temperature dropped. My body and legs felt fine, but my arms became cold. I have several thick long-sleeved T-shirts, but I don't have any thin long-sleeved T-shirts.Twice during the run, once going out and once coming back, I counted the number of times my left-foot hit the ground, and the count was 46 both times. That is the same number I had Tuesday in the rest phase of my cadence drills.I'm practicing being a stealth runner by having my feet hit the ground with less impact (no slap, slap, slap sound as my toes hit the ground). I did, though, hear a new noise that I hadn't noticed before -- a scraping noise. As I've mentioned in previous posts, I shuffle when I run. The scraping noise was from my shoe sliding on the ground. That means I was really shuffling; I wasn't lifting my feet more than a half inch or so and was sliding my shoe.I also practiced gliding when I slowed down for my walking breaks. I found myself taking several seconds to transition from running to walking, and I covered about 50 feet during that time. That is 50 feet with little energy spent. I calculated that with two walking breaks per mile, over a 13.1 half-marathon, I would have 26 glides, and at 50 feet each, that would be a quarter mile that was almost free in terms of my body using energy to cover that distance. That, hopefully, would give me more energy to use at the end of the race.Earlier this week, and again today, I saw several ducks that were significantly smaller than a Mallard and were coal-black in color, including the head, with a white bill. I searched google but didn't find a picture of the ducks I saw. There is a brown duck called the American Black Duck, but that wasn't what I saw. The ducks I saw were, maybe, half the size of a Mallard.There is a quarter-mile stretch of the Parkway that has a good view of the Jordan River. In the past when I've run that stretch after sundown, I would see hundreds of ducks in the river settling down for the night. Tonight, though, as I ran that stretch on my way back, I only saw a few ducks, perhaps 15-20 ducks. Also, I didn't see any ducks near the Parkway path foraging for food. I guess that with the advent of warm, spring-like temperatures, the ducks have gone to other parts of the valley. If we have a cold snap come in, it will be interesting to see if the ducks return."},

I think I've run too many of the drills. Galloway says to just run 3-7 of them. I've probably been running 9 or 10 of them. Even though my increase in speed is slight, the number of the drills means I'm running that faster pace for a significant portion of my run. Next Monday I'll cut back to four or five drills and see how that goes. I haven't been running very fast during the winter, and I need some time to increase my speed.I usually run my two-hour run on Wednesdays, but I have a busy schedule today.

With the advent of our warm temperatures yesterday and today, the snow is melting fast, and I'm seeing litter in quite a few places.I picked up a lot of litter yesterday and today. There is still more litter out there, but I'll worry about that next Monday.In case any of you are wondering why I pick up litter while most runners just ignore it, here are the reasons. I enjoy nature, and I like to run in areas away from streets, houses, cars, and people tending their yards. I don't, though, like to run in a city dump. So, I pick up litter so I'll have a nice view as I run. Another reason is that I moved to Utah from Massachusetts, and it is a New England custom to leave a hiking trail cleaner than it was before I hiked it."},

As I did last Monday, I ran the first mile to warm up, and then I did cadence drills separated by a minute or so of recovery running. I used the last mile to cool down from the drills. When I first began the cadence drills, I had 45 steps in the rest phase and 47 steps in the faster phase. After a few of those, my rest phase went up to 46 steps and my faster phase to 48 steps. Then my rest phase went up to 47 steps and my faster phase stayed at 48 steps. I like to do cadence drills. They give my body a taste of speed without much fatigue. I concluded the run with a nice kick for about 50 yards. The kick was faster than I had been doing in the cadence drills.Today is a beautiful day for running!

During my run the shade temperature was in the mid 40s (F) and the direct-sun temperature was probably in the high 50s (F).  I wore two layers, but after a mile, I took off my nylon wind-breaker. Even my thick, cotton, long sleeved T-shirt was too much.Even though the shade temperature during my run was in the mid 40s and most of the Parkway path is dry, there is a big patch of water from melting snow that still covers the path. The low temperature last night was about 25 (F), and that patch of water had a layer of ice under the water. From a distance the ice looked like a big puddle of water. My mind was wandering off exploring the world and I wasn't paying attention, and I ran into the ice and almost went down. My foot slipped on the ice, but I was able to keep my balance long enough to hobble over the the edge and hold onto a wooden railing while I regained my balance.

Blended in with the performance are scriptural quotations and pictures depicting Old and New Testament accounts that Handel referenced in writing the score. In doing the DVD I did some things I hadn't done before, such as having all the sound come from a CD of the performance instead of from my camera, and I learned a lot about lip syncing and coordinating pictures with words being sung in the performance, and I had some good experiences. Now, I can get back to my normal activities including getting more sleep.I only had 5 hours of sleep last night, so I didn't run today.

Raising ones foot high off the ground takes energy. \"As long as you pick your foot up enough to avoid stumbling over a rock or uneven pavement, stay low to the ground.

So, the stiffness seems to be due to my Monday run. I did a number of cadence drills, but the increase in speed during the drills was very slight.As a result of the stiffness, I'm taking a rest day today.

{"title": "Today was fartlek day", "date": "Saturday, January 27, 2007", "text": "I ran 5 miles along the Jordan River Parkway, and three of the miles were \"fartlek miles\". During the first mile, I ran my comfortable resting pace to warm up. Then for the next three miles I ran fartleks, and then I ran the last mile at my resting pace to cool down. I felt good during and after the run. Here is a link for those not familar with fartleks.http://www.runninginjuryfree.org/speed.htmlThe fartleks ranged from about 50 feet to maybe 400 feet. In general the shorter fartleks were run at a faster pace than the longer fartleks (the shortest were sprinted), but all of them were run faster than my resting pace. After each fartlek I ran my resting pace to recover from the burst of speed. I ran my resting pace until my body felt ready for another fartlek.  One of the advantages of fartleks is that they don't put a lot of stress on your body, due to the short distance that they are run. In other words, you apply the stress of faster running to your body for a relatively short distance, such that your body can easily handle the stress. My kicks at the end of each run are fartleks.I practiced acceleration-gliding after each fartlek and during the change to my walking breaks.The temperature during my run was in the mid 30s (F), but we are in an inversion and the air was polluted with haze and automobile smog that can't dissipate into the air. The Salt Lake valley is surrounded on three sides by mountains, and this \"bowl\" creates inversions in which cold air is on top of warmer air, and the cold air prevents the smog from dissipating. It was so bad today that I couldn't see the Wasatch Mountains that are shown in the pictures of the Parkway in my right side-bar to this blog.In my Friday posts, I discussed the concept of acceleration/gliding (ACG) that is taught by Jeff Galloway in his book Running Until You're 100. I thought I would briefly explain the science behind gliding. If you're not into science, feel free to skip this post.Let's assume that you're running at your desired pace. You have stored in your body energy that is due to your movement. This energy is known as kinetic-energy. If you finish your run and quickly stop, the kinetic-energy will go to 0 because you have no movement. The energy that was in your body, however, has to go somewhere; it doesn't just go \"poof\" and disappear into thin air. Your body absorbs the energy as heat, and you probably begin to sweat. In effect, you paid a price for that energy by applying stress to your body to get it to move at your desired pace, and then you waste it by quickly stopping, causing the energy to be dissipated in the form of heat. That isn't a very efficient way to run.Jeff Galloway is suggesting that instead of stopping quickly, or even going quickly to a slower pace, you take a few steps to gradually slow down and thus allow your kinetic energy to be dissipated in the form of forward movement of your body instead of heat in your body. This is a more efficient method of running, and that means that you'll go your distance with less effort.Now, let's look at it from another perspective. Sir Issac Newton, in the year 1687, published three laws that describe motion. His first law states that \"A body at rest remains at rest, and a body in motion continues to move in a straight line with a constant speed unless and until an external unbalanced force acts upon it.\" In other words, a body in motion wants to stay in motion, and a body at rest wants to stay at rest. Newton's first law is also called the Law of Inertia. This is the reason why, if your car stops quickly, your body tries to continue moving until it is restrained by your shoulder belt, or if you're not wearing a belt the dashboard and windshield. It is also the reason why you are pulled back into your seat when your car quickly accelerates from a semaphore light. If you are running and quickly stop, your body wants to continue moving forward.Jeff is suggesting that we take advantage of your body wanting to continue moving at your faster pace, the momentum of your body, and let that momentum pull you forward until the kinetic energy is dissipated. You do this by taking a few steps to slow down to a stop instead of quickly stopping."},
{"title": "Cadence Drills", "date": "Friday, January 26, 2007", "text": "Starting on Monday, January 29, I will be performing cadence drills during my hour run on Monday. Jeff Galloway, in his book Running Until You're 100 explains that the drills help one to run faster by running smoother and easier. He describes them as a \"gentle\" drill, and they should be appropriate for my weekly rest run on Mondays.A cadence drill has two phases that are repeated several times. First, jog or run a 30-second interval and count the number of times your left foot touches the ground. Next, after a minute or so of slow walking or jogging for recovery, run another 30 seconds and try to increase the count by 1 or 2. Notice that each repetition starts with the first phase that yields a new count.Jeff Galloway recommends acceleration-glider (ACG) drills to conserve energy and thus be able to run faster. The idea is to take advantage of the momentum of your faster pace to \"glide\" as you gradually slow down. The gliding takes less energy since you're using the momentum from your faster pace. They would be appropriate for going down hills and for slowing down for walking breaks, water stops, etc. Jeff recommends that the drills be repeated several times once a week. He cautions, however, that we shouldn't sprint during the drills.Let's assume you're running and want to slow to a walking break. Rather than making a relatively quick transition to walking, gradually slow down and let your momentum carry you as far as possible. By doing this, you will cover more distance with less expenditure of energy.I've done this unintentionally in the past. I usually take about two steps to go from running to walking, but on occasion I've let myself go farther as I slowed down to a walk. I literally felt my body push me as I slowed down. I'm taking walking breaks every half mile, and I'm going to use ACG to transition to the walking. Also, my two-hour and longer runs involve a couple of large hills and a couple of small hills, and I'll use ACG to go down the hills without a lot of energy being used. Of course, I'll eventually be able to run my normal pace down the hills as my legs and knees gain strength."},
{"title": "Allen, the stealth runner", "date": "Thursday, January 25, 2007", "text": "I noticed yesterday that most of my running is now stealth running with little noise except for the swish swish of my nylon pants and my hat brim scraping my nylon jacket.I'm hoping that this means that my running is now a bit more efficient. I can use some extra energy at the end of my runs :) I think the reason for the change is that I may be developing better form as my body gets stronger. Because of my stiff joints, I've never had great running form (one runner told me I had my own style). Jeff Galloway, in his book Running Until You're 100 explained it this way. He was describing his \"Cadence Drill\" in which one attempts to take faster steps.\"In the process of improving turnover, the body's internal monitoring system coordinates a series of adaptations which make the feet, legs, nerve system and timing mechanism work together as an efficient team\"."},
{"title": "And better than last week", "date": "Wednesday, January 24, 2007", "text": "I ran for two hours on the Parkway and had a great run! I went about a quarter mile further than I did last week and enjoyed the run. I felt sluggish during the first three miles, but felt fine after that. That first part was my \"warm-up\" phase. My kick at the end was shorter but faster than yesterday, almost a sprint for about 200 feet.The temperature was 33 (F) when I left. I returned at about the same time I did yesterday, after the sun had set. My wakeup HR was 55, high due to two nights of insufficient sleep last week. I've been sleeping well this week."},
{"title": "Better than yesterday", "date": "Tuesday, January 23, 2007", "text": "Today was a repeat of yesterday, only I felt even stronger and ran a bit faster for my comfortable pace. In the hour I covered 5 miles instead of the 4.6 miles that I've been doing. The temperature when I left home was 28 (F), although a couple of hours earlier it peaked at 37 (F). Last night was a low of 15 (F), same as the night before. I forgot to take my wakeup HR this morning :(I threw in a nice kick at the end. A bit faster and a bit longer than my other kicks so far.I've felt really good during my runs during the past couple of weeks. That may indicate I'm heading into another peak in my running. I've been in sorta a slump during the winter, and I'm hoping that I'll be able to have a strong Spring of running that will peak on April 21.I mentioned in a previous post that I usually make a lot of noise when I run, due to my toes hitting the ground hard and causing a slapping sound. I'm a slap, slap, slap runner. I also mentioned that once in a while, I run with very little noise; I referred to it as stealth running.I've been experimenting with with my form to see if I can induce the stealth running (in the past, it has occasionally occurred without me doing anything to cause it). I've found that I can induce it, and I'm practicing doing the stealth running. In my normal running, I hit with my heel, and my foot then hits the ground with a slap sound. In stealth running, I hit with the flat of my foot, and since my foot needs less movement to allow me to toe off, less noise is generated.I have to be careful, though, that my attempts to be a stealth runner don't lead me to injury. Our bodies have their \"natural\" style of running, and attempts to change that need to be slight, such that our bodies are slowly led to a new form. Abrupt changes, can in my humble opinion, increase the stress on our bodies.My motivation for running with less noise comes from two sources. First, an article in Runner's World. The article reported on an interview with Bill Rodgers. The author asked Bill to run at his marathon pace. The author commented that he (the author) was struggling to keep up with Bill, and Bill was gliding along with little noise. Second, in his book Running Until You're 100 Jeff Galloway describes a \"gliding\" technique of running that takes less energy. I'll discuss that technique in a later post.Yesterday, as I was entering my car after my run, I saw three cars with several people, and the people were all dressed in the same training clothes. As I drove out of the parking lot, I saw several more cars with occupants wearing the same training clothes. Altogether, I saw about a dozen cars. None of the people looked to be of high school or younger age. I wish now I had turned around and asked who they were. It would have been interesting to watch them train for a few minutes. I noticed during my run today that someone had used a black spray can to draw a short line across the asphalt of the path and to paint the word \"POST\" next to the line. I don't remember seeing that inscription before. It was about 1/3 mile from the parking lot."},

{"title": "Different running this winter", "date": "Thursday, January 18, 2007", "text": "My running is different this winter than during my winters in New England. New England is colder than Utah. I think, that for the same reading in (F), the New England winters feel about 10 degrees (F) colder than they do in Utah. This difference in feel is probably due to the higher humidity in the East.When I ran during New England winters, my whole purpose was to survive. I ran slower due to ice, and I only ran for an hour, because my body started to feel cold after an hour. I wore 5 layers during the coldest part of the winter. By contrast, here in Utah the streets and the Jordan River Parkway are clear of ice, and I'm able to run for two hours and feel fine. I wear 3 layers during the coldest part and usually only wear 2 layers. I'll be starting speed training this week by running fartleks on Saturday, and I never would even consider doing speed training in January in New England.When I speak of so many layers, I'm referring to layers over my core. I've never worn more than two layers on my legs and just one layer on the bottom part of my legs. My legs don't seem to feel the cold.I'm planning on running the Salt Lake City Half-Marathon on April 21. It's way to early to decide on a pace for the race, but I thought it might be helpful during my training to have a rough idea of the pace I might run during the race.My PB for the half-marathon is 2:21:56 and was sent in August 2006 at the Great Salt Lake Half-Marathon. In April, I would like to set a new PB of 2:10:00 or faster. To reach 2:10:00 I would need a pace of 9:55, but because I'm taking walking breaks, I would actually need 9:25. My average pace for the GSL was 10:47. Thus, I would need to reduce my average pace for the race 1 minute 23 seconds. That, basically, is my goal during the next 2 1/2 months: to reach my August 2006 pace and then beat it by 1:23.Note: when I speak of my PB for the half-marathon, I'm referring to my recent running of that distance. The race in August 2006 is my only running of a half-marathon. Twenty five years ago, when I ran marathons, I didn't run any half-marathons, but my time for the first half of the four marathons I ran was about 1:51:21. If I had been running a half-marathon instead of a full marathon, I would have run faster and would have had a time about 1:31:42. Because of my age it isn't realistic for me to try to run a half-marathon in 1:31:42, so I'm trying to set a new PB for a recent running of that distance.I think it may be realistic for me to try to beat the 1:51:21 number, but first I have to do 2:10:00 or faster. As my friend, Bruce, says: baby steps, baby steps."},
{"title": "Another great two-hour run", "date": "Wednesday, January 17, 2007", "text": "I ran for two hours along the Parkway and covered 9.15 miles. I had a 30-second negative split, and I really enjoyed the run. I felt great during the run and after I finished. When the sun went down, I had about a mile and a half left, but there was enough light after sundown so I could see the path ok. I threw in a short kick at the end of the run.The temperature was in the mid 20s (F) when I left home and 18 (F) when I returned. We still have 1 - 2 inches of snow on the ground, but the path is clear of ice and dry. The low last night was 4 (F).Last week, while I was doing my two-hour run, I noticed I was running with very little noise. I usually make a lot of noise when I run, because I hit the ground hard with my heel and then my toe slaps the ground. This time, it seemed like I was gliding along. Instead of my usual slap, slap, slap, I was running in stealth mode, and I noticed I was hitting the ground with the flat of my heel instead of the edge of the heel. I noticed the same thing today, almost no noise as I ran -- just a swishing as the brim of my hat brushed my nylon wind breaker. During this stealth mode, I felt relaxed, as if I was floating along the path. It only lasted a few minutes and then I was back to my slap, slap, slap, but it was nice while it lasted.On my way back, I saw a family of quail walking through the snow looking for food. I don't think they were the same family that I saw earlier in the winter since today they were about a mile south of the other quail. I never see quail in the middle of the day, but I see them more or less frequently at dusk."},

I didn't run a fartlek at the end of the run. My wakeup HR was down to 54 this morning (55 yesterday morning).My cold was very \"drippy\" on Saturday and Sunday, but on Monday it went into the \"thick mucus\" stage and has been in that stage today. I would have run yesterday, but my daughter drove down from Evanston, WY (90 miles) to help me with the DVD I'm making of the Evanston Messiah program that was held in December. She sang with the choir.Here is a word of warning to everyone who reads this blog: The only people who get colds are those with weak immune systems. If you get proper rest, eat nutritious food and don't eat food with a lot of additives, and have a good exercise program, you shouldn't get any colds because you should have a strong immune system. So, when you get a cold, consider that a warning that perhaps you should look at your life-style to see why your immune system couldn't fight off the cold. Disclaimer: this post is not intended as medical advice. For medical advice, see a doctor.I saw a few robins hopping through the snow looking for food. I haven't seen many robins along the Jordan River Parkway, and I was glad to see them. They have always been one of my favorite birds.A friend of mine made a post in her blog that described her school experiences in running. I enjoyed reading that and thought I'd explain my school experiences. So here goes.There, done. \"But wait a minute\", you say. \"You didn't write anything.\" That's right, because I didn't have any school experiences in running. My Jr. High and High Schools had no track program or other running program. My PE classes didn't involve running. I don't recall my schools having field days. As far as I was concerned, running didn't exist during my childhood.During high school my friends tried to get me to try out for football, but I declined their encouragement. I played neighborhood football with them and knew it wasn't my thing. I was born with a skeleton that was, as a specialist described, \"the opposite of double joints.\" I've never been able to do quick movements or to fall gracefully. Football would have killed me. I was too awkward and slow for basketball. I did play baseball on a neighborhood team. I also played baseball on a neighborhood team, and I played left-field because I could just stand there and catch a fly ball once in a while. I don't remember any baseball program in my high school. I do remember a gym class in the 7th and 8th grades (1st two years of Jr. High) in which we had to do \"tumbling\". My attempts at tumbling were to put my head and hands down down and let my momentum carry me over the rolled-up mat -- I always landed with a \"crash\".In terms of physical exercise, the one good thing I had going for me was that I did a lot of walking and bike riding. I lived in a small town of about 5000 people in Southern Utah. It was about a mile to school, and I walked it twice a day (we came home for lunch). It was a half-mile to the public library where I would devour books. Another quarter mile put me in the down-town area for shopping. A couple of miles east was the \"red hill\" where we hiked. A couple of miles south were the \"south fields\" where we played \"army\" with WWII gear we bought surplus. A couple of miles west were the \"west hills\" where I shot my 22 when I first got it as a 12-year old.  About three miles south-west was my dad's farm (with his brothers) where I hunted jack rabbits. In those days, if you wanted to go somewhere, you walked or rode a bike! I even remember as a small grade school age child riding my tricycle (not bicycle) several miles to my cousin's farm to spend the night.I did lots of jack rabbit hunting during my adolescent years. I remember one winter day walking to my dad's farm and hunting jack rabbits for several hours. There was about a foot of snow on the ground, and my only protection for my feet was a pair of rubber galoshes -- thin rubber shells to keep our feet dry but provide no insulation. As I was walking back, I encountered my neighbor who was going out to hunt jack rabbits. I turned around and went hunting with him. I ended up walking in the snow for 8 or 9 hours. When I got home, I discovered my big toe was black and blue, and the toe nail came off a few days later. Frostbite! Such was the life of a teenage walker.My first introduction to running was while I was in college and in the Utah National Guard. I attended basic training at Ft. Ord, California and did a lot of double-time running. I had no problems with that and enjoyed it. After my six months at Ft. Ord and a small military camp in Southern California, I returned to college in Logan, Utah. Each summer for four years I attended National Guard summer camp at Camp Williams near Salt Lake City. After camp one summer, an army friend suggested I continue the running we had been doing at camp. That sounded interesting, so I did it a few times that summer, but when school resumed, I was too busy (Electrical Engineering major) with studies to continue the running.It was probably 10 or 15 years later when I started to seriously run as a way of strengthening my feet muscles -- I would suffer great pain when I would spend 7 or 8 hours on my feet doing yard work. I have been running ever since. I run because I enjoy it!"},

Resting today will give me a better chance of running all four days next week.I had planned on running an hour of fartleks today, but the temperature this morning is 10 (F), and I'm not sure I want to do speed in cold weather.

My goal during January and the first week of February is to run fartleks.I ran a fartlek at the end of my run this morning. That fartlek is often called a \"kick\", and it is a nice way to end a run or race. For the last 150 or so feet, I increased my pace a bit. Not a big increase, but enough for the first time. I will do this kick after each run from now on.Jeff Galloway, in his new book Running Until You're 100 recommends shorter but more frequent walking breaks. I've been taking one minute walking breaks every mile, but this morning I tried 30-second breaks every half mile. I enjoyed them and will continue with the shorter breaks.I know where the mile points are on the Jordan River Parkway, but I'm just guessing about the half-mile points. Also, I didn't time the 30 seconds. My walking pace is about two steps per second, so I just counted steps. I don't think the distance and time have to be exact.

I replied to his comment, and I thought I'd post my reply here for those who don't read the about.com forum.---------------Many years ago there was a runner named Dr. George Sheehan. He was one of the legends in running. In one of his books, he talked about running clothing. He said you could tell the newbies, because they had the latest fashion. The experienced runners wore grubbies. Running shoes, of course, were an exception to his statement.Things are different today, because running clothes have improved, and wearing the latest clothing has advantages to runners in extreme conditions. I bought my first poly T-shirt last summer, and I'll never go back to cotton. I bought my first 100% poly socks last year, and I'll never go back to cotton. I do, though, wear mostly grubbies. I'm still wearing my nylon running pants that I bought 25 years ago, and I still have my nylon wind breaker that I bought almost 30 years ago. When I layer for winter, I include old cotton shirts that still fit but are too worn to be used as an outside layer. Cotton is a good insulator if it is kept dry. If it gets wet, it is dangerous because it freezes.You're right that training counts! And, I would add that common sense about pushing yourself too much or too little in training counts, too."},

One of the first signs is increased stress associated with running, often resulting in motivation problems. At the first sign of these symptoms, reduce mileage and let mind and body get back together again:Running is not as enjoyable.You don't look forward to your runs.When you say something to others about your running, the statements are often negative.The negativity can permeate other areas of your life.You look on running as work instead of play.I ran for an hour on the Jordan River Parkway this morning and enjoyed myself.

In my almost 44 years of employment, I've known many great people and am a better person because of their influence in my life. I've always enjoyed my work and have looked forward to each day.This was the year I took my running to a new level. In the 2 1/2 years since my auto accident and 6 1/2 weeks in the hospital and my first run after the accident of 1/8 mile, I'm running 30+ miles per week. I set a PB in the half marathon of 2:21:16. I'm looking forward to the Salt Lake Half Marathon in April. I'm still running without injury, and I'm still running because I enjoy it and because I want to.This was the year that I gained a greater appreciation and love for my friends and family.This was my first year of retirement, and I've discovered that it's great to be an old geezer! They call us \"golden-oldies\". I'll accept the \"golden\" part, but I'm still young! Oldies are those over age 100....This was another year in which I'm glad to be Allen Leigh!I had a great run for an hour this morning. The temperature was 33 (F) when I left and 40 (F) when I returned. The sun was out, ice was melting, and it was a great morning to be outside. I felt more energetic this morning than I have for the past month, and my wakeup HR was down to 49 this morning. I ran at the comfortable pace I've been using all week, and I really enjoyed the run.A mile and a half into my run, I passed some picnic areas, and I saw a man and a woman trying out their new snow shoes. Later, I passed a walker, and two runners passed me. I had thought I'd be the only one out on this Christmas morning, and it was nice to see a few others."},

However, I haven't sung tenor for about a month due to my voice being hoarse due to a cold in my throat. My colds usually begin in my nose and possibly move to my throat, but this cold was just in my throat. No dripping nose, no sore throat, just an occasional cough that brought up thick, yellowish phlegm. For the first month I just ignored it since it didn't get worse and didn't seem to be a problem. However, I did notice that my voice was hoarse and that my voice would crack when I would try and sing tenor.I finally decided to do something about it and started taking Hepar Sulf, a homeopathic remedy for colds that have thick, yellowish mucus. The cold isn't completely gone away, but yesterday I sang tenor during the congregational hymns."},

South Jordan City and Riverton City had the snow cleared from the path, except for a couple of access points. On the way out, I ran at the comfortable pace I used yesterday, and on the way back I ran slightly faster. It was on the way back that I experienced the feeling of cruising down a highway as if I could drive forever. I don't get that feeling often as I run, and it is a cool feeling. My energy level was higher than it has been lately, due in part to my getting 8 hours sleep the past couple of nights. My wakeup HR was a bit high (51) this morning, but I still felt great.As I was finishing the first half and was nearing my turn-around point, I started feeling cold, indicating my body wasn't generating enough heat to keep me warm and propel me down the path. Twenty-four years ago while running marathons, I learned that I would start getting cold after an hour, and that was my experience today. At my turn-around point, I stopped and swallowed an e-Gel pack. I didn't feel cold any more as I continued my run. I ran 9 miles and probably burned about 1000 calories due to the distance and the cold temperature. The e-Gel gave me 150 calories, so I burned a net of about 850 calories during the run. I've been eating more food, via grazing during the day, so I think (hope) I had enough food before I left for the run.I ran in the late afternoon, and it was just getting dark when I finished. I was glad to finish before it got really dark, because there were patches of ice on the path from melting snow, and I was able to see the ice and skirt around it.

I usually just tuck my hands inside the sleeves of my wind breaker, and that is sufficient to keep my hands warm. That was sufficient during the first hour of the run today, but during the second hour, my hands got cold. The cold-hands started with me swallowing an e-Gel and thus having my hands in the cold air for a couple of minutes. After I started running I tucked my hands back inside the wind breaker, but they didn't get very warm. When I reached my car, I had a hard time undoing the zipper on my wind breaker pocket to retrieve my car keys -- I couldn't grasp the handle of the zipper very well. In fact I had a hard time tearing the top off the e-Gel for the same reason, and e-Gels are usually easy to open. I have a pair of light, cotton gloves that I wore in Massachusetts, and I'll try them. Also, in Massachusetts I sometimes just wore a clean pair of cotton socks over my hands, and that worked fine, too.When I pulled into the parking lot by the parkway, there were several kids sledding down the hill into the parking lot. Apparently that hill is \"the\" sledding hill around here. In fact it is the only hill around here that doesn't have automobile traffic. The western part of the Salt Lake Valley has a gentle slope from the Oquirrah Mountains to the Jordan River, but the city streets aren't conducive to sledding. During the last eighth mile before the river, the land drops sharply into the flood plain, and that is the reason for the steep downhill into the parking lot."},

There is about a foot of snow on the ground from the storm Saturday night and Sunday, but the path was clear of snow thanks to the kind folks working for South Jordan City. The temperature was in the mid 20s (F) during the run, and the sky was partly overcast. It was a great day to be out.The beginning of the parkway path is about 25 feet below the adjacent street, and there is a steep hill going from the adjacent street to the parkway parking lot. When I returned from my run, there was a family sledding down the steep hill. They were having a lot of fun!As I watched them, I was reminded of the time we came up from Phoenix to Salt Lake for a Christmas visit. We spent several hours each day sledding down the steep hill at Sugarhouse park. That was 32 or 33 years ago, and I still remember it as if it were yesterday. I also remember the time after we had moved from Phoenix to Massachusetts that we spent an evening sledding down our driveway (a 30 foot elevation change) using our car lights to see the driveway. We were up until midnight. That would have been the winter of 1976-1977. Ahhh... great memories!My wife and I recently attended a lecture by a man who claims that we can improve our brains by following certain natural methods (exercise, nutrition, etc.). He said that if we exercise and get our heart rate up to 80% - 85% of our maximum rate, we will have an increased level of Human Growth Hormones, and the higher level of HGH will improve the functioning of our brains. He said it isn't necessary to sustain that rate; just get the HR up to that level and then walk to let the HR come down, and then repeat the sequence for 10-15 minutes per day. He said to use a HR monitor to monitor the HR. He didn't say this, but I would suggest that non-runners start out at 40-50% of max and then slowly (maybe 5% per week) increase the rate up to 80%. Of course they should get an ok from their doctor before trying to increase the amount of HGH in their system.My wife thought she would like to try his suggestion, so we bought a Polar HR monitor. She is a good walker and shouldn't have a problem with 50% of max.I tried the monitor on my run today. It was interesting to see my various heart rates throughout the morning and then during my run. The speaker we listened to used the traditional formula 220 - age as the maximum. That value isn't quite accurate, but it is close enough for most of us, and it is an easy formula to use. For my age (71) here is a table of HR rate values and percentage of maximum.60 40%75 50%89 60%104 70%106 71%107 72%109 73%110 74%112 75%119 80%134 90%149 100%During the first mile, my HR slowly climbed up to 70%, and it remained at 70% for the next mile and a quarter when I reached my turn around. On the way back, my HR was at 71% until the last half mile where it was at 73%. I ran a little bit faster on the way back.I was running at my comfortable speed, and the HR numbers show that I was running at a restful, LSD pace. I've been running via \"feel\" for 34 years, and it was nice to know that my \"feel\" agrees with recommendations for a restful run. I won't be using the HR monitor as a normal thing, but starting in January, I will use it to check on my \"feel\" during my speed work during the spring. I want to continue running via \"feel\" but would like the assurance that my \"feel\" is about right.By way of information, my wakeup HR was 49 this morning, 32% of max. While using my computer, my HR is about 39% of max. While walking around it is about 47% of max.By way of observation, I was surprised how quickly my HR came down after I stopped running and began walking for a cool-down. Within 100 feet of walking, my HR dropped about 10 points. I walked about 1/4 mile and did stretches for a couple of minutes. When I finished all of that, my HR was down to my \"walking\" value."},

We thus decided to drive home that night, and we arrived home 2 1/2 hours later, as explained in yesterday's post. When we awoke this morning, there was about 6 inches of new snow on the ground, and 2 or 3 more inches fell during the day.

On the way back, however, we drove over half of the distance through a snow storm. The snow was only a couple of inches deep, but it caused everyone to slow down. A trip that normally takes 1 1/2 hours at 70 mph took 2 1/2 hours at 30-50 mph. I'm glad we made it home safely.

My wakeup HR was 49.On the way back, a man and a big dog passed me, and I thought to myself, \"He is going fast\". However, I soon realized that he had started alternating running and walking, and his overall average was about the same pace I was doing. I thus followed him for the last three miles until he finished his run and left the trail. I still had a mile to go, and I ran until I reached my time-goal, and I then walked the rest of the way (about half a mile) to my car.As an experiment, I ate a can of Campbell's Chicken Noodle soup about half an hour before I left for my run. It had a slight effect on my breathing for the first mile, and then I felt fine. The soup only had 60 or 70 calories, so it probably didn't do much for my energy level. It also had a lot of sodium, almost half of my MDA. I also ate an energy bar just before I started to run, and I ate an e-Gel pack at my turn around point.While on my long run today, I reached the parking lot that is a couple hundred yards north of 126th South, and I saw a small dog running around the path. I assumed he belonged to two women I saw in the parking lot, so I pointed to them and said, \"Go\". The dog ignored me and continued running around. So, I turned around and jogged over to the women, and the dog followed me. They said the dog didn't belong to them, and that they and several others had tried to catch the dog to see if he had an ID collar. They said that I was the only person who could get close to the dog.I continued my run, and the dog followed me. He seemed to be a happy dog and ran around in the bushes and on the trail. After about half a mile, I passed a man and a woman and a large dog. The little dog decided to go with them, and I continued my run, alone.On my way back, I encountered the two people and the large dog, and the small dog was still with them. I decided I'd better get the little fellow back to the parking lot where I first saw him, so I whistled at the dog. He stopped and looked at me and then at the two people who were moving away from him. I whistled again, and the little dog looked at me and then at the two people who were getting farther and farther away from him.After a few more whistles and the dog looking back at the two people, who by this time were quite far away, and at me, he decided to go with me, and he came running to me. We continued our journey north towards the parking lot.As we approached the tunnel under 126th South, the little dog was about a hundred yards in front of me. Instead of following the path into the tunnel, he followed a path to the street and its many cars.As I turned to go into the tunnel, I whistled at the dog and yelled at him, but he didn't come down to me. He turned and started going west on 126th South. That was the last time I saw the dog. I hope he knew his way home. He had a collar but no ID."},

The sky was relatively free of clouds, and it was a great day to be out.A few days ago I was thinking about my running and wondering why I've been so tired the past few days. I had taken rest days and had slowed down, and I still felt tired. I'm not sure why I did it, but I added up my caloric intake for that day, and I couldn't believe my eyes: 600-700 for the whole day. After I had double checked my arithmetic to be sure I hadn't missed some food, I thought to myself, \"No wonder I'm so tired!\" I need about 500 calories per day (average) just to make up the energy spent in running, plus approximately 2000 calories for normal body functions. That is, roughly, 2500 calories per day, and I got only 600-700.One of the things I've noticed as I get older is that I don't feel hungry very often. I get busy with my projects and forget about eating, and I don't feel hunger-pangs to remind me to go eat a meal. All of a sudden it's bed time, and I haven't eaten much. So, I'll just think food all day long.For the past few days, since I realized how few calories I'm eating, I've been making a positive effort to eat regular meals, and that paid off in today's run."},

Marathons put a lot of stress on ones body, and I don't want to subject my body to that amount of stress. I ran four marathons about 24 years ago and enjoyed them and the training for them. Now that I'm significantly older, I want to run distance without the stress of 26.2, and 13.1 seems about right.I'm capping my distance at 33 miles per week, so the next phase is speed training. I think I will continue to run LSD during December to strengthen my base, and then I'll begin running fartleks in January. My current thoughts are to run fartleks once a week by reducing my long run from 2 1/2 hours to an hour and running fartleks during that run. I would keep my 1-hour rest runs on Monday and Tuesday and my 2-hour medium run on Wednesday (all LSD). That would give me 25 miles/week with speed training once a week.I would like to do that during January and February, and then run intervals during March. The intervals would be on Saturday for half an hour. My Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday runs would be the same. April would be a week of LSD (hopefully faster than my current LSD) and then a two-week taper to Saturday, April 21, 2006 and the Salt Lake City Half Marathon. My real goal for the year is the Senior Games in October, and the SLC half would be to check my progress and give me a better idea of the training I need to do before the Games."},

Being retired, I have a lot of time to do yard work, house repairs, etc., and usually I have a lot of energy and interest in doing those things (once I quit procrastinating and get busy with the tasks, that is). Towards the end of last week I just moped around and didn't get much done. I went out running but didn't have the excitement that I usually have for the running. I recognized that I wasn't getting much done around the house and yard, and I told myself that I needed to buckle down and get busy. Of course, doing that would just make things worse.Fortunately, I realized on Saturday that my real problem was that I needed a rest from the intensive training I was doing. I was overtraining.

I felt fine during the first half, but my feet were tired during the last half, and I walked the last two miles to avoid any possibility of an injury.My wakeup HR was 49.A couple of weeks ago I mentioned my left foot felt weak -- no pain or soreness, just weak, as in not carrying my full weight. I mentioned then that I was going to wear a new pair of shoes to see if the problem was caused by my shoes which are nearing the end of their useful life. My feet felt fine last week, but on the last half of my run this morning, my left foot felt very weak, and my left leg was a little bit stiff.I don't think the problem is my shoes. I think my feet are tired from all the miles I've been running the past three months since my half-marathon in August. Having weak feet is \"normal\" for me. Let me explain.I was born with a stiff skeleton, actually a malfunctioning skeleton. I started running in the early 70s because I was having a lot of pain in my feet. Knowing I had stiff joints, I went to a bone doctor to see if my skeleton could be causing the pain. He said \"no\". He said my foot was stiff, the opposite of double joints. He also said my muscles were weak, and that I needed to do what ever I wanted to strengthen them. I had done a lot of walking in my childhood and during college--walking 5-10 miles was no problem at all. But, once I finished college, I had a car and drove most places, and my feet started to hurt due to my not walking as much. My feet didn't hurt during normal activities, just when I was on my feet for a long time, such as doing yard work on a Saturday. I've always enjoyed walking, and after visiting the bone doctor, I decided to run to strengthen my feet.My running has helped my feet. I don't have the pain very often, but I do have the \"weak\" feeling in my feet. Also, when I sit down, my feet get stiff, and when I get up, I have to walk around a few minutes before they loosen up. I first felt a few weeks ago that my left foot felt weak. I didn't think much about it, because that is a \"normal\" feeling for my feet. However, when the weak feeling persisted, I began to worry about it and thought that maybe my shoes were causing it. During my run today, I realized that the problem is just that my feet are tired and need a rest.Jeff Galloway recommends that runners take a rest week once a month to give their bodies extra rest. I've never done that but have thought about it from time to time. I think now is the time for a rest week, so next week, I'll run reduced mileage and let my body and feet rest."},

I still had to run against a headwind, but it wasn't as strong as it was yesterday and Monday. I slowed down on the way out so I would be running at my comfortable pace, and I ran faster on the way back for the same reason. My pace varied from about 11:30 to 12:30. I had two e-Gel, one at the beginning of the run and one at the turn-around point.My wakeup HR was 48. The temperature was 57 (F) when I left and about 60 (F) when I returned. The sky was cloudy with just a bit of sun breaking through. A great day for this late in the fall.I mentioned a few days ago that on my longer runs, my left foot felt weak -- no pain, no soreness, just weak as in not being able to support my weight. This feeling would come and go during my two longer runs. I said that I would be wearing a new pair of LOCO Mojo shoes this week to see if the problem was due to my other shoes reaching the end of their life and no longer giving adequate support.My foot felt fine during my run today. So, I'll see how it feels during my 2 1/2  hour run on Saturday.After I finished my run, I sat in my car for a few minutes looking at my splits via my Garmin 101. The parkway path was about 200 feet in front of me. I saw a bunch of ducks walking around the path looking for food. I saw a white bird mixed in with the ducks. The bird was slightly larger than the ducks, and it had a longer neck and a smaller head. There were dark spots on the wings, and the rest of the duck was white. It might have been a goose, but it's head looked smaller than the goose heads that I've seen in the past. What ever kind of bird it was, it felt at home foraging with the ducks.A few days ago I saw a hawk flying not quite directly over me. It would flap its wings for a couple of seconds and then glide into the wind for a couple of seconds. It was a beautiful sight."},
{"title": "Still having the brisk head wind", "date": "Tuesday, November 21, 2006", "text": "I felt pretty good during and after my hour run. I had a brisk headwind that felt a little stronger than yesterday. I slowed down going out and made the run another \"litter\" run. Going back I ran a bit faster but didn't let my body go as fast as it wanted. I didn't want to impact my medium run tomorrow.The sky was overcast, but the temperature when I left was 60F, and it was a nice day to be out.My resting heart rate was 45 this morning. I was hoping it would be 44, but it didn't quite make it. This is just the second time in 22 years that my resting HR has been below 46. When I ran marathons in the early '80s, my resting HR was 44, and then one day it dropped to 40 and stayed there until I stopped marathon training."},
{"title": "Had a brisk headwind, and I slowed down", "date": "Monday, November 20, 2006", "text": "My resting HR was 46, and I felt pretty good before the run but not quite as good during and after the run. I think I was still recovering from my long run on Saturday.I ran an hour rest run. There was a 10-15 mph headwind, and I slowed down and ran at my comfortable pace. My first mile was 12:10. I decided that with the headwind and resulting slower pace, I would make this a \"pick up litter\" run, and I got quite a bit of litter that had blown in with the wind.On the way back, the wind was a tailwind, and I ran faster at my comfortable pace. My last two miles were 11:40 and 11:50.Running against the wind takes extra energy, and that can tire a person out. I prefer to slow down, such that I use about the same amount of energy, and thus conserve my energy for the latter part of the run when I'm getting tired.I mentioned a few weeks ago that I had a feeling of \"weakness\" in my left foot. No pain, no soreness, just a feeling of weakness as I run. It usually comes in during my two longer runs. I was thinking about it on Saturday during my long run, and the thought came to me that it might be my shoes. The shoes I'm wearing are the ones I used during the Great Salt Lake Half Marathon in August. They're getting close to 500 miles, and I've been planning on changing them at the end of the year. During most of the miles on those shoes, my left foot felt fine. It's just been the last month or so when I felt the \"weakness\" feeling.So, I wore a new pair of shoes this morning. I'll wear them during each run this week and see if they have any effect on my left foot. My foot felt fine this morning."},
{"title": "Ran eight miles fine and then got tired", "date": "Saturday, November 18, 2006", "text": "I ran my 2 1/2 hour run today along the Jordan River Parkway. I ran at a comfortable pace, about 11:15 miles on the average. During mile 5 and 6 my body wanted to go faster, but I said \"no\" and kept a constant pace. During mile 9, I started to get tired, and I naturally slowed down. When my 2 1/2 hours ended, I still had 3/4 mile to go. I stopped running and walked the rest of the way. My goal for the rest of the year is to increase my Thursday run to 5 miles, and then to hold my weekly mileage constant at 38 miles until February or March. I'll keep saying \"no\" when I have an urge to go faster. The stress from increasing mileage is enough, and I don't want to compound that with additional stress from going faster.I forgot to measure my wakeup HR this morning (it was 47 yesterday), but I felt pretty good during the morning and during the first 8 miles of the run.I usually run soon after getting up and before I eat breakfast. However, I didn't run today until noontime, and I didn't eat breakfast because I expected to be leaving soon for the run. The bottom line is that I ran at lunchtime without having eaten breakfast. So, it didn't surprise me that I became tired during the latter part of my run. I ate a banana just before my stretches, and I had two e-Gel, one when I left my car and one at the turn-around, and they probably helped."},

I'll decide then if I want to increase my long run up to 15 miles (adding 1/2 mile increments), or if I want to start some speed training, beginning with fartleks once a week.Seven or eight months ago I couldn't run two days in a row.

As I left home to do my run on the Jordan River Parkway, I looked forward to a great run. I wasn't disappointed! I ran at a comfortable pace and felt pretty strong during the run.My first mile was 11:05, a bit fast for the 10-15 mph headwind that was blowing, so I slowed down for the next few miles. I ran a pace of about 12 minutes for those miles. During my return, I had a tailwind, and I went a little bit faster, probably around 11:30 miles.There weren't many people on the path. Except for a man feeding the ducks, I didn't see any others during my 5-mile leg out, but I saw a few on my leg back. The temperature was 30 (F) when I got up and 38 (F) when I left home. When I returned, the temperature was in the 40s (F)."},
{"title": "Running against a headwind", "date": "Wednesday, November 15, 2006", "text": "A lot of people have difficulty running against headwinds. They have problems, because they try to maintain their no-wind pace. To be successful as runners, we must be flexible such that we adjust our training to meet the problems we encounter.We may leave home not expecting a headwind, but as soon as we discover there is a headwind, we should adjust our training accordingly. Headwinds are like hills. They try to push us backwards. It takes energy to overcome the headwind and make progress in the other direction. Thus, unless we have a lot of energy to spare, we can't expect to run at the no-wind pace. The common-sense thing is to slow down and not waste a lot of energy fighting the wind. During the first half of the run, I did slow down, and I felt comfortable while I ran against the wind. I wasn't frustrated because of the wind. I just accepted it and adjusted my pace accordingly. Similarly, on the way back, the wind was now a tailwind, and I felt comfortable even though I was going about 30 seconds faster.When I parked and prepared to begin my run, I saw a man sitting on a bench overlooking the Jordan River. There were about 30 ducks on the pathway next to the man. The man was about 100 feet from the start of my run, so I walked up to say \"hello\". Rather than feeding the ducks bread, as most people do, he was feeding them grain. There were kernels  of grain all over the path. He said that many of the ducks inhabit the irrigation canals during the summer and then migrate to the river after the canals dry up for the winter. When I ran the canal roads, I had been wondering where the ducks went for the winter; I assumed they would fly south. Now I know that they fly east a few miles to the Jordan River and mooch off the walkers.When I passed the bench on my return leg of my run, I looked to see if all the grain had been eaten -- it had. The path was free of grain....and ducks."},
{"title": "Another comfortable hour", "date": "Tuesday, November 14, 2006", "text": "My wakeup HR was 48 this morning. I waited to run in the afternoon after my grandchildren had left. Also, it was warmer, the mid 40s. I had a great rest run, running around a 11:30 to 12:00 pace. There was a 10-15 mph tail wind on the way out and a head wind on the way back. It was a beautiful afternoon! Sunny with quite a few clouds. The tops of the snow covered Wasatch Mountains were covered with clouds.In my run this afternoon,  about two hours before dark, when I passed by the quarter-mile stretch that gives me a good view of the river (as reported in yesterday's post about the ducks), I saw about a hundred or so ducks gathering in the river. I haven't seen them on days that I've passed this stretch earlier in the day. The ducks were apparently gathering for the night.After I got back to my car, I sat there for a few minutes watching a large flock of birds prepare for the night. I don't know what kind of bird they were, but I'm guessing Starlings. There were probably 200 or more birds in a large flock. They would fly through the air, zig zagging around, and then they would all land in the same tree. The tree looked like a Christmas tree with each bird an ornament. Then they would take off and fly around for about a minute and then land in another tree. After landing in five or six trees, they picked a tree that was out of sight, and they disappeared."},

I didn't run in the morning, as I usually do, because my wife and I took three grandchildren to the South Towne Mall to ride the carousel and the escalator and to have lunch at Wendy's. My pace during the run was a comfortable pace around 12:10. It was dark on the way back, but because the sky was overcast, the clouds reflected light from the city, and I could see the trail as if it were dusk instead of dark.My wakeup HR was 49, and I felt fine during the day and the run.On the return half of my run tonight, there is a quarter-mile stretch that gives a good view of the Jordan River. Because of light being reflected from the water, I could see the river quite well. I saw many dark objects on the water. The objects were ducks. There must have been two or three hundred of them. They seemed to be swimming against the current just enough to remain stationary relative to the shore. I've seen flocks of birds gather in trees as one large community to spend the night, but this is the first time I've seen large quantities of ducks gather as a community to spend the night. I heard a few quacks here and there, but for the most part, the ducks were quiet."},

I thus decided to do my long run this evening instead of in the morning. Since the Jordan River Parkway has no street lights, I ran the long street that traverses the Salt Lake valley for about 25 miles. I've mentioned this street in previous posts. It has sidewalks and is well lit and makes a nice night route.I forgot to measure my wakeup HR today, but I felt ok during the run. I ran a slow, restful pace and enjoyed the run. I had been on my feet most of the day building a concrete foundation for a heavy water fountain that is in our front patio, and I needed a rest run. When we first got the fountain two years ago, we just put it on the dirt in a flower garden, and, as the months went by, the fountain slowly sank into the dirt and finally began to tilt. About three months ago, we moved the fountain onto the brick patio so I could build a foundation for it. With cold weather coming, I decided I'd better get the foundation ready before the snows come.It was dark when I left. The temperature was 36 when I left and also when I returned. It was a pleasant evening to be out.I don't think I had breakfast this morning, I don't remember eating anything, and I know I had no lunch. In mid afternoon, after I learned I would be tending my two grand children tomorrow, I decided to do my long run tonight. To give me some energy, since I hadn't eaten much if anything, I had a Nature Valley energy bar. Later, I had two more bars about an hour before I left for my run. I had an e-Gel pack just before I did my stretches, and I had another e-Gel at my turn-around point.The bottom line to all of this is that I left for my long run without much energy stored in my body. I was on my feet most of the day building a concrete foundation for our water fountain, mixing and using 560 pounds of ready-mix concrete. I felt reasonably energetic during the run. My legs started getting tired on the way back, but my body energy remained pretty good. I didn't feel the energy that I would need to do a speed run, but I didn't feel the fatigue that I've felt in the past. I think the two e-Gels had a good effect on me. I like the four flavors of e-Gel, and the gel is easy to swallow. The top of the plastic container is easy to tear off. e-Gel is a nice product, and I'm happy to recommend it to my visitors!"},

After reading those comments, I began reading about energy gels, and I've tried two different gels. I decided to go with e-Gel, because it gives me more salts and better carbs than I get with other gels, and e-Gel also gives me some antioxidants and vitamin B6. In addition, e-Gel is isotonic, meaning it is mixed with just the right amount of water to allow it to be quickly absorbed into ones body. Yesterday, for example, within just a few minutes from taking the e-Gel, I could taste the salt in my sweat. Each pack of e-Gel has 150 calories compared to 100 calories from other gels."},

{"title": "How I tell I've recovered from a stressful run", "date": "Monday, November 06, 2006", "text": "A normal wakeup heart rate is a good indicator that our body is overcoming the stress and is returning to normal, but it does not indicate that ones body has fully recovered from the stress and is ready for another speed or longer distance workout. At least with me, a high energy level is the best indicator I've found that I'm ready for more distance or speed. I first look for a normal wakeup heart rate, and then I look for a high energy level. By using both indicators, I'm able to listen to my body and respond accordingly. Sometimes, though, and Saturday was an example of this, I have a good energy level, and even though my wakeup HR is slightly high, I'll still do a stressful workout."},

My parasympathetic nervous system has become dominate and is causing my body functions to return to normal. I could tell, though, that I was still tired. I had no desire to go faster. Tomorrow will be another hour rest run.When we apply stress to our bodies, our sympathetic nervous system responds and elevates our breathing rate to give more oxygen to our bodies. Our heart rate increases to give more blood. If needed, our sweat glands are activated to cool us off. Our adrenal glands are activated to produce certain hormones to help our bodies handle the stress of running. After we stop running, our sympathetic nervous system slows down, and our parasympathetic nervous system becomes dominate and causes our bodies to recover by returning to normal conditions. Thus, in order to properly manage our running, we need to know the symptoms that tell us we are under stress and the symptoms that tell us when we have recovered from stress.I ran for an hour on the Jordan River Parkway. My first mile was 11:40, and the other miles ranged close to that. I picked up some litter and enjoyed being outside. I enjoyed being able to run a relatively slow, restful pace."},

The sky was cloudy, and there was a drizzle for the first third of the run. The temperature was in the mid 40s (F).I saw a lot of ducks on the path looking for handouts of food. There were about 30 ducks following a woman and her young daughter up the path.This run was my first experience with gels. I've been hearing on running.about.com that gels are helping runners avoid hitting the \"wall\", and I thought I'd try them. I took one yesterday to see how my stomach reacted -- no problem. So, I took one just before I left for the 10 minute drive to the Jordan River Parkway, and I took another one after 1 hour 6 minutes into the run.

However, the marathon distance puts an awfully lot of stress on ones body, and I've decided I don't need that stress. Instead, I'm going to focus on the half-marathon, a distance I've been running weekly for about six months. My goal is to set a new course record for the half-marathon at the Huntsman World Senior Games in St. George, Utah.The current course record for Men 70-74 is 2:04:17.8 set in 2005. My PB for the half-marathon is 2:21:16 set in August at the Great Salt Lake Half Marathon. I believe I can break 2 hours in the next year or two. To do that, I'll need an average pace of 9:10 My average pace for the GSL was 10:47, so I have a big challenge ahead of me.My strategy for training is the following.1.  Reach the half-marathon distance. This is important, because in May 2004 I was in a serious auto accident and was in the ICU for four weeks. I was in an induced coma for most of that time. My first run after the accident was 1/8 mile. I accomplished this step when I ran the GSL in August.2. Extend my running from 3 days/week to 5 days/week. I'm half way there. About a month before the GSL, I added a fourth day and brought it up to 2 miles. After the GSL I brought that rest run up to 5 miles. Within the next month I'll add my 5th day and should have it close to 5 miles by the end of the year.3. Extend my long run from 13 miles to 15 miles to give me a slight buffer for the half-marathon distance.4. Begin speed training, starting with fartleks once a week and then later doing intervals once a week or maybe once every two weeks. Prior to the fartleks, I'll continue to just run faster as I've been doing before and after the GSL.5.  In October 2007 make my first trek to St. George for the Senior Games. It's about a seven hour drive.One good thing I have going for me is the difference in altitude between the Salt Lake valley and St. George. St. George is at an elevation of 2800 feet, while my home is 4700 feet and the Jordan River Parkway where I run is 4300 feet. That elevation change will make a big difference to an old geezer like me.For those interested, the web site for the Senior Games ishttp://www.hwsg.com/"},

Also, during the last four miles, I took longer walking breaks. I could tell when I did my stretches this morning that I was a bit tired. I tried to start at a slower pace, but considering my condition when I did my stretches, I should have gone even slower. I'm getting to the point where anything slower than a 12:00 pace seems almost like I'm walking. This is a good sign, because it shows my body is getting used to a faster pace than I've done during the past year. Also, I only had about 6 hours sleep last night due to putting two new disks (Raid 1) in my Macintosh that I use for video work, and that may have influenced the run.It was a beautiful day for running.

They didn't fly away when I walked among them, so I guess they've gotten used to people giving them food. One day, quite a few weeks ago, I saw a man walking along the path with a bag of bagels.

During the day I was busy doing some things in my yard that kept me on my feet, and I felt fine. Then, I spent a couple of hours on my computer, and I noticed when I rose from my chair that my right quad was a little sore.  My computer chair is too low, and that causes my quads to be stretched while I'm sitting down. I thought that stretching might have caused the soreness. Or, maybe it was a delayed effect from my run, although I ran a comfortable pace and didn't push myself in either distance or speed. When I awoke this morning, after a good 7 hours sleep, my quad was still sore and remained so during the morning and early afternoon. I returned home from church about 2:30 pm and prepared to take a nap. I did my groin, knee, and quad stretches and then slept for two hours. When I awoke, the soreness was gone, and I've felt fine during the evening. I'll probably never know for sure what caused the soreness, but it apparently wasn't serious.Older people like me need more time to recover from stress, and we can't afford to over-stress our bodies."},

When Judy and I first moved to Utah 13 years ago, we made a hike to the top of Timp, and I flew my kite off the peak. Lots of wind that day. That kite is the same one I tried to fly from the top of Mt. Washington in New Hampshire. Mt. Washington is the highest peak in New England and it gets the brunt of the North Eastern winds that bring in lots of snow. The USA record for wind was set on Mt. Washington, something like 200 miles per hour.

Also, I missed my afternoon half-hour nap the past two days (schedule problems), and that adds to the problem of insufficient sleep. I did sleep well last night and hope to get my nap this afternoon.I'm really glad that today and tomorrow are rest days. I feel fatigued and need the rest.

I felt good and went faster during the first mile than I usually do, and I continued a fast pace for the whole run. Prior to the GSL half-marathon in August, I would run 5 miles in the hour. Yesterday, I ran for an hour and went about 1/3 mile past the 5 miles. Today I went about 1/2 mile past the 5 miles. I keep mentioning that I let my body set the pace, and you're probably getting tired of hearing me say that. But, I'll say it again, because it is such an important aspect of running injury-free: I let my body set the pace today. I have to keep in mind, however, that even though I may have a high energy level that allows me to run a faster pace, I can still have a muscle injury if my muscles aren't strong. Hence, the importance of doing stretching exercises to (a) loosen my muscles, and (b) strengthen my muscles. And, the importance of getting rest after each heavy run.Here are my splits from today (no water stops or walking breaks, as usual during my hour runs).Mile 1 11:05Mile 2 10:49 Included a brief stop to take off my wind breakerMile 3 10:28Mile 4 10:33Mile 5 10:00As I ran today, I felt like I was running about the same pace that I did for my 13-mile run on Saturday. If so, I not only set a new PB for my 13-mile training run, but I might have broken my time for the half-marathon that I set in August. My average pace for the half-marathon was 10:48. Unfortunately, my stop watch quit working on Saturday after a couple of miles, so I don't have a time for that run and am not counting it as a PB. But, there are more Saturday runs to come....Today was a significant improvement over yesterday's results. The fact that I ran an hour yesterday and an hour today is significant, because a few months ago I couldn't run two consecutive days. I'm obviously heading into a peak in my running, and it will be interesting to see how long the peak lasts before I go into a slump.My wakeup HR was 47 this morning.

{"title": "I'm mixing speed and distance, but...", "date": "Monday, October 16, 2006", "text": "I'm a firm believer in not mixing speed and distance in my training. Both put stress on ones body, and I think it is wise to subject our bodies to stress from only one source at a time. So, I usually do LSD for my distance running, or do fartleks and intervals for my speed training, but not both in the same runs.However, as you're aware if you've been following my blog, I've been increasing the distance of my Tuesday rest run and also letting my body go as fast as it wants to go. This means that I'm mixing distance and speed together. I'm doing this because I've been making small increases in my distance: approximately 1 mile per week added to my Tuesday rest run. One mile increase in 30 miles run per week is ~3% increase per week. I figure that is a small increase and that my body can handle the stress from that as well as the stress from running faster. Also, I'm letting my body decide about running faster, so when it wants to run faster, that is ok because it is doing well in handling the stress from the small increase in distance and the stress from running faster. The way a person gets into trouble by mixing speed and distance is when the person's brain, not the person's body, decides to run faster even though the body may not be doing well in handling the stress from the faster runs.Tomorrow will be my last Tuesday to add distance. I'll add 10 minutes, and that will give me another hour rest run. Then, I'll start a new rest run on Thursday, starting with 10 minutes, and I will add 10 minutes per week. So, by mid December my Thursday rest run will be up to an hour, and I'll cap it at that amount of time. That will give me approximately 38 miles per week. I won't start increasing my long run from 13 to 14 and then to 15 miles until February.My wakeup HR was 45 again. I felt pretty good during my stretches, but when I began my hour rest run, I felt tired. As usual, I let my body set the pace.

{"title": "It's been a great year!", "date": "Saturday, October 14, 2006", "text": "Next week is my 71st birthday, and I've been reviewing the past year per my blog entries. The past 12 months have been great, and I'm grateful to the Lord for his blessings to me and my family.One year ago, I did 10 miles for the first time. I felt ok, but my legs were stiff and I felt tired. During the next month, November, 2005, I worked up to 12.8 miles, but I was tired and my legs were quite stiff. I decided to drop back to 10, but before I could do that I had emergency surgery to have my gall bladder removed. December, 2005 was a recovery month from the surgery. After the surgery, I dropped back to 8 miles, and by the end of the month I had worked up to 10 miles.January, 2006 started well with me doing 10 miles. Then, I caught a bad cold or the flu (not sure which), and that set me back. I ended the month doing 4 miles and working up to 6 miles. February was an eventful month. Thanks to a suggestion from a friend at running.about.com named Randy, I changed my training schedule to have more variety: I now have shorter rest runs, longer medium runs, and even longer long runs. I ended the month with my long run being 10 miles. March was a good growth month, and I ended the month with a long run of 11 miles and a medium run of 9 miles. My speed increased to a pace of 12+ minutes.April was a continuation of the growth. By months end, my long run was 14 miles, and my medium run was 10 miles. My rest run was 4 miles. May was a continuation of the growth, and my long run reached 15 miles. I also started exploring another canal road. During June, I recognized my body wasn't ready for 15 miles, and I dropped my long run back to 13 miles. I planned to run a half-marathon in August, and I set my long run to be that distance. Earlier in the spring, I had set a goal to run the Boston Marathon in 2010, and during June I changed that goal to be 2011 to take advantage of the lower qualification time due to my being 75 during that year. Also, I switched from the canal road to the Jordan River Parkway for my runs.July was a training month for the half-marathon. I focused on running faster, I didn't do fartleks or intervals, just a faster pace for my runs. I brought the time for my 13-mile run down from about 3 hours to 2 hours 41 minutes.August was a taper to the race on August 19. I finished the half marathon in 2:21:16, an unbelievable time for me. That was 20 minutes faster than my best training run. The rest of the month was a recovery from the race and a recovery from a cold. Also, during August (after the race) I switched from mile base runs to time based runs.September and October have been good months. Before I ran the half marathon, I had added a fourth day on Tuesday and had leveled that day off at 2 miles. During September and October, I brought that day up in miles, and next week it will be 5 miles, and I'll cap it at that distance (same as my Monday run). September and October have been months in which I have increased my speed. I didn't intentionally run faster; I just let my body dictate how fast I went. Next week I'll use my GPS to get a good measurement of my speed.Yes, the past year has been a good one!"},

It wasn't a pain, just a low-level \"feeling\" that I can't describe. Not a scraping or a soreness, just a \"feeling\". It only lasted for a few seconds and then went away, but it came and went a few times during the first mile. I hadn't done my knee stretches before the run, so at the end of the mile, I sat on a grassy hill and did the exercises. I did have the \"feeling\" a few times during the next three miles, but only when I first started running after a walking break. I didn't feel it anymore after about four miles. I think the knee was reacting to the stress from yesterday's faster run. If it doesn't come back, I'll be in good shape.I only carried 12 oz of water with me and drank a swallow or two during each walking break. However, when I returned my urine was darker than normal, so I do need more water for today's weather condition.I had a great 50 minute rest run this morning. I felt energetic during my stretches and during the run. In fact, I did a negative split. It was a beautiful day in the 60s (F), and I enjoyed being out.

{"title": "A great 2 1/2 hour long run", "date": "Saturday, September 23, 2006", "text": "I ran my 13-mile route on the Jordan River Parkway this morning, and I finished in 2 hours 34 minutes, a new PB for a 13-mile training run. When I crossed the 12-mile mark, I was at the exact time (2:21) that I finished the GSL Half Marathon. I kept a pretty constant and relatively fast pace for 11 miles, and then I slowed down a bit for the last 2 miles. I didn't force that fast pace; I just let my body dictate how fast it wanted to go, and I focused on keeping a constant pace. I slowed down during the last 2 miles, because my left ankle started feeling a bit weak; no pain or soreness, just weak as if it couldn't support my body weight. I didn't want to risk an injury and slowed down by 1-2 minutes/mile. I've had that feeling before in my ankles. It doesn't seem to be a serious problem; just a sign from my body that my ankle has reached its limit.My wakeup HR was 51, and the temperature was 44 (F) when I left home. A sunny, bright, cheerful day, a great day for running and for being outdoors. Except for missing my half hour Tuesday run, I'm back to my pre-GSL mileage.Today was the end of an era for me. I've used Etonic running shoes for almost all of my running career, beginning in 1976 when I moved from Phoenix to Massachusetts. Back then Etonic was a strong name in running shoes. About 8 or 9 months ago I decided to try new shoes to take advantage of advancements in shoe design and newer materials. The Stabilizer Pro shoes I was using are an old design, at least 15-years old. I tried LOCO shoes (http://www.locorunning.com/) and liked them and have been using them for the past few months. However, I did have one pair of Etonic Stabilizer Pro shoes left, and I wore them during the late spring and early summer.About 100 miles before the GSL, I switched to a new pair of LOCO Perfecto shoes and wore them in the GSL. I used my old Etonic shoes as my everyday shoes. After the GSL, I went back to my old Perfecto shoes. I decided this morning that it was time to switch back to the new Perfecto shoes and to use the old ones for my everyday shoes. So, I took my old Etonic shoes to the trash bin with gratitude in my heart for about 30 years of good service by the Etonic company.I read recently that Etonic is coming back into the running-shoe business, and I hope they do well. I like my LOCO shoes and will stick with them."},

If I had run a particular distance this morning, I would have (a) pushed myself to complete the distance, thus going beyond the capabilitiesI only saw two other people on the Parkway. The first person was a woman walking her dog. The second person was a runner.

I ate a banana just before I left, and that might have helped a bit.My plan for walking breaks is to not take breaks during my rest runs but to take them during my medium and long runs. In a few months after I've stopped adding time to my runs and have gotten used to the longer distances, I'll slowly phase out the walking breaks from my medium and later my long runs. I ran the hour this morning non-stop with no walking breaks and no liquid intake. The beautiful fall weather we're having helps in reducing my need for extra liquid (I always drink water when I get up and again just before I leave)."},

We visited my brother-in-law in Washington and took a ferry to Seattle to see the Space Needle. We also took a ferry to Victoria, BC, Canada and enjoyed that day. On the way back we visited my sister in Oregon, and we stopped in Boise, Idaho to see my mother-in-law's 34th great grand child who had been born just an hour before. We also went to Rexburg, Idaho to see my mother-in-law's 33rd great grand child who had been born a couple of days before.Just as we entered Portland on I5 South, we saw an auto accident. About 200 yards in front of us, a car went from the center lane across our (left) lane and hit the concrete divider. It bounced off the divider and landed upside down. I was worried that the car would burst into flames, but it didn't. The driver was awake when they pulled him from the car and put him in an ambulance. If my car had been a few seconds further down the road, the other car would have hit us broadside. I couldn't see what caused the car to veer across our lane. Then, today as we entered Salt Lake City, I was in the center lane of I15 South, and a car in the left lane went across all lanes and stopped on the right shoulder. It looked like the driver was tring to take an exit from the inside lane. The car came very close to hitting the car in the right lane, and I think it may have clipped a truck that was in front of me in the center lane, because the truck stopped on the left shoulder. I don't know for sure what happened, but I was glad I wasn't a few seconds down the road! Then, to top it all off, as I left I15 to drive the last 10 minutes to home, there was an accident about a block east of the Interstate. That accident occurred several minutes before I got there, and it was on the opposite side of the Interstate from where I would be driving. Needless to say, I was glad when I got home and turned off the key.I did a little running during the trip. I ran a couple of miles twice the first week and once this week. I also got a two-hour workout last week pushing my mother-in-law in a wheel chair around the Butchart Gardens in in Victoria. She had done a lot of walking before we got to the gardens, and she was ready for a rest. The path was hilly, and I got a good workout. Tomorrow, I'll be back on the Jordan River Parkway and will do 1/2 hour to an hour, depending how I feel.Here are two pictures from the Butchart Gardens at Victoria. The beautiful woman in the first picture is my wife, Judy. The second picture is of the Sunken Garden that originally was a limestone quarry."},

I kept up that type of pace for 6 miles and a slightly slower pace for another 2 miles. Before the race I pushed myself to run 13 miles at a 12 minute pace, and since the race I'm running 4-5 miles at approximately a 12:30 pace. My fast pace during the race really was an abnormal pace for me, and I think I was at a peak (all racers dream of peaking for their races). It's taking me longer than I expected to get my distance back since the race, and I think that means two things. I'm needing longer to recover from the race due to my exertion during the race, and I'm probably in a slump. It's normal for slumps to follow peaks.My wakeup HR was 52 this morning, and I ran for an hour. I drank 12 oz of water during the run. I felt tired, compared to last week, and didn't push myself during the run. I had a good 7 hours sleep last night, but the night before I only had 5 hours due to an early morning (4 am) phone call for my daughter-in-law who is a nurse at a local hospital.

This cold is like my previous cold, in that my body quickly (2 days) went into the \"thick\" stage and then took several days to leave the \"thick\" stage. Before I started running, I would be in the \"thin\" stage for a week and in the \"thick\" stage for another week.

So, what I've been doing is the thing I should be doing, only now I do it because I'm thirsty not because it is the proper thing to do. I sweat a lot and need more liquid than some runners would need. The color of my urine when I get back indicates that I'm getting about the right amount.

Part of it is that my son, daughter-in-law, and grandson have had colds this past week. Since they live with us, I've had a lot of exposure to their colds. The other factor is that when I ran the GSL, I really pushed myself hard, harder than I've ever pushed in a race. I was really tired after the race, but I seemed to recover fine.

The result is that I'll have an automatic adjustment on the miles that I run.

That pace felt comfortable, and I was surprised when I looked at my Garmin the first time and saw the 9:39. It was kinda dark, and I couldn't see the watch very well. I thought maybe I had set it up wrong. When the 9:53 came in I could tell that the watch was working correctly, and I was really surprised that I had maintained that fast pace for two miles.

I experimented with my Garmin GPS to learn how to measure lap paces. I experimented with lap times of 1 mile and 0.3 mile. I think I'll go with the default of 1 mile. I also experimented with fewer walking and drinking breaks to see how I responded to those changes. Because of the heat, I had to be careful about drinking less water. My urine when I got home was a little darker than it has been but not excessively darker. I also experimented with the way to get more vitamin D that I mentioned in my previous post. After about 1.3 miles, I stopped in a shady spot and put on the sunscreen.I decided to revise my race strategy for the Great Salt Lake Half Marathon and do the second mile at 11:30 instead of 11:00. I need about two miles to get warmed up, and by doing the first mile at 12:00 and the second mile at 11:30 I'll be more likely to handle the remaining miles at 11:00. By listening to my body to see how I feel during the race and by using the Garmin to measure my pace each mile, I'll be able to adjust my pace to be as fast as possible but not so fast that I \"peter out\" towards the end of the race. Back in the \"old days\" we didn't have electronic devices to measure pace. The marathons I ran did have frequent mile-markers, so I wrote on my hand my desired times for the major mileage points, and as I passed each mile-marker, I would compare the clock time from my stop watch with the numbers written on my hand.

The article is available online at The Miracle Vitamin.The article discussed the importance of getting vitamin D from the sun as well as from supplements, and it suggested that we spend 10-15 minutes in the sun each day before we apply sun screen. Fair skinned people may need to spend less time in the sun. When I run, it takes me 10-15 minutes to warm up, and I thought I'd try running without sunscreen for that time. After 10-15 minutes of running, I'll stop and apply sunscreen to my arms and legs. When I run, I wear a wide brimmed hat that shades my face, and I don't put sunscreen on my face."},
{"title": "A lovely day for a \"stroll\" in the park", "date": "Thursday, August 10, 2006", "text": "After tending my three-year-old grandson for three hours, I ran two miles on the Jordan River Parkway. It was 92 (F) when I returned, and I was ready for some liquid. I drank a glass of water just before I left, and by the time I reached the one-mile turn around point, I was thirsty. Because of the short length of the run, I didn't take liquid with me. I normally would have run the two miles on Tuesday, but because I didn't run on Monday, I shifted my Monday run to Tuesday and my Tuesday run to Thursday.My wakeup HR was 47 and I felt pretty good this morning.Sports scientists used to say that it was best to drink liquid before one became thirsty, but they now say it is best to wait until one is thirsty. By doing that, one reduces the likelihood of over hydrating and thus having electrolyte levels that are too low. Over hydrating is as dangerous as under hydrating because of the dilution of the electrolytes due to excessive water.Training GraphsI've also been thinking about my race strategy for the GSL. During my training runs, I've been running of 11+ minute miles, and my average pace has been slightly above 12 minutes (I've been taking one-minute walking breaks every mile). During the race, I'd like to take fewer walking breaks, just taking them at the water tables. I'm thinking of running the first mile at a 12 minute pace to complete my warm up, and then going to an 11 minute pace for the rest of the race, and going a bit faster during the last half mile. This would give me a total time of about 2 hours 23 minutes. My PB for a 13-mile training run was 2:41, so a 2:23 would be an decrease in time of 18 minutes or slightly more than a minute per mile. Can I make that increase? I don't know, but it's worth a try if I feel good. I'll reevaluate this strategy on Friday of next week.I'm not sure how much sleep I'll get before the race. I have to be up at 4 am and out of the house at 4:30. I usually don't sleep well before important activities due to anticipation-stress. At my age, I need that sleep... Training Graphs"},

The temperature (at my house) at 6:30 this morning was 59 (F). The sun wasn't up but was close to peaking over the mountain. The 10-day forecast for Clearfield, Utah on weather.com is for sunshine and a high of 90 (F) and a low of 67 (F). Sunrise will be at 6:42 am. The race starts at 6:30, so the temperature during the race will be about 67-68 (F) at the start and probably in the mid to high 70s at the finish. An 8 mph breeze is predicted, and it will be a side wind (all winds in the Salt Lake valley are north or south winds, and the race will be going due west). Utah weather changes a lot, so a prediction this early of a sunny day may not mean much. If a storm front comes in, the temperature will change, too. But, the predicted sunrise should be accurate :)Training Graphs"},

I was late getting out, and the temperature was in the low 80s (F). Most of the run was in the direct sun, and I drank 24 oz of liquid (my normal ratio of half water and half Gatorade). Because I was well hydrated, I didn't mind the heat at all, even though the sun burns more than it did when I was in Massachusetts. The difference is that here I'm at an elevation of 4800 feet while in Massachusetts I was at a typical elevation of 300 feet.When I run the Great Salt Lake Half Marathon next week, I will be at an elevation of 4200 feet. I don't know if going down to that \"lower\" elevation will give me much additional oxygen, but I \"hope\" it does help a bit. After I had been in Utah for about four years, I went to Connecticut for my daughter's graduation from college, and I found it much easier to run there than it was here in the Great Basin. Getting sufficient oxygen is the name of the game in running long slow distance.Training Graphs"},

I can tell my body needs some additional rest. I've had a good month of training. I've gotten used to the 13 miles, and I've significantly decreased my average pace. The two weeks of shorter rest runs will allow my body to recover, and I'll hopefully peak on August 19.Training GraphsI ran my 13-mile route along the Jordan River Parkway and finished in 2 hours 43 minutes. Not quite as fast as last Saturday but a good time, none the less. The temperature was about 70 (F) when I started running and was about 90 (F) when I returned, and it was a nice run. I went out a little faster than I had been doing in previous runs (my first mile was 11:39), and that might have hurt my overall time. My time at 10 miles was 2 hours 4 minutes for an average pace of 12:24 including walking breaks. My average pace for the 13 miles was 12:32 including walking breaks. During the first 5 miles, my average pace was just a few seconds under 12 minutes. Thus, my pace varied maybe 45 - 60 seconds during the run. Most of the time lost per mile was in the middle of the run where there are some small hills and one large hill.During the run there was a 8-10 mph head wind during the first half and maybe a 5 mph tail wind on the way back. The wind, however, wasn't consistent. It would come and go.I took 60 oz of liquid with me -- two bottles of Gatorade and one bottle of water. I drank about 50 oz. I checked my urine when I was home, and it was a light yellow, indicating I drank about the right amount of liquid.I saw a garter snake slither across the path. It was interesting to see how it moved. It's body formed a \"S\" shape, and I could see the \"S\" shape move from its head to its tail; somehow that movement caused a horizontal movement of the snake.Training Graphs"},
{"title": "My running saved my life", "date": "Friday, August 04, 2006", "text": "In the evening of May 19, 2004, my wife and I were in an automobile accident. I was taken to a hospital and checked for injuries. None were found, and I was released from the hospital. Two days later I was back in the hospital as a \"code blue\" emergency. My ribs were broken during the accident, and they punctured my lungs. When I was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit, my oxygen level was very low. And, while in the ICU, I developed a serious case of pneumonia.I was in the ICU for four weeks and was unconscious for most of that time. My church leader visited me even though I was unconscious and didn't know he was there. He asked a nurse about my chances for survival, and she said, \"He doesn't have any. Unless he has a strong body, he won't make it.\" Twice during the four weeks my family was called in because I wasn't expected to make it through the night. The first time my family was called in, my wife was in a different hospital recovering from her injuries and couldn't come to my hospital; her brother went to her bedside while my children came to mine.Thanks to the grace of God, the skill of the hospital staff, and to my strong body as a runner, I did make it. I mention my strong body as a runner, because after I left the ICU, I went to a different hospital for therapy. The first time I tried to stand by myself, I could only do it for two seconds. I had to learn to walk: first just standing until my legs could support my body, then using a wheel chair, then a walker, then a cane, and finally by myself. During my 10 days in therapy, when a new nurse would come into the room, she would say, \"So, you're the runner.\"When I left the hospital I couldn't walk up stairs very well and needed a banister so I could pull myself up the stairs. During a month of home therapy at my sister-in-law's house, my wife and I took daily walks and were walking a mile when we went to our own home. A week after arriving home, I went for my first run and could only go 1/8 mile before I had to stop. I was a former marathoner and was running about 15 miles a week when the accident occurred, and now I could only run 1/8 mile. But, I was alive!During the next year, I had surgery for a double hernia, 10 surgeries for very large Basal Cell skin cancers, and my gall bladder removed. That year was not easy, but I continued to run each week except for a couple of weeks after each surgery. During the two years since the accident, I went from a run of 1/8 mile to four runs a week, totaling 30 miles per week, the longest run being 13 miles. In two weeks, on August 19, 2006, I will run the Great Salt Lake Half Marathon from Clearfield, Utah to Antelope Island in the lake (no, this isn't a triathlon, and I'll be running on a causeway rather than swimming). Hopefully in 2007 I'll run another marathon, and my goal is to run the Boston Marathon in 2011 if I can qualify. I will be 75 in that year.I just added an essay to my religious site in which, after giving the information that I've given above in this post, I discuss the impact of the accident and my recovery on my spiritual life.

The 2 hour time includes 1-minute rest stops after each mile.When I left home to drive to the Jordan River Parkway, the temperature was 59 (F), and when I returned it was 72 (F). A relatively cool day for this time of year, although my T-shirt was soaked with sweat when I finished. My wakeup HR was 51, and I felt a bit tired during the first couple of miles. I ate a banana just before I left, and that may have slowed me down. My time for the first mile was 13 minutes and about 40 seconds, a full minute and a half slower than my average for the whole run. Now that I'm going faster, I'm beginning to question the wisdom of eating anything before I run.I ran most of the way up the big hill on the north side of the detour through the neighborhood but walked the last 50 feet to reduce the stress on my body. However, I ran up the hill on the south side of the neighborhood. That hill is shorter but steeper than the one on the north side. This was the first time I've run up the south side. I doubled my breathing rate and went right up the hill. I'm sure the lower temperature helped a lot.Later:I checked my urine when I got home, and my drinking 40 oz of liquid (half water and half Gatorade) was about right.

The shade temperature when I left home was 70 (F), and I had a great run. I finished in 2:41, my fastest 13-miler to date. When I arrived back home, the shade temperature was 89 (F). The cooler temperature and the extra liquid (four 20-oz bottles) that I drank made the difference, and I was able to set a new PB for my long run.There were lots and lots of people on the Jordan River Parkway this morning. Just before I got to my turnaround point, I came upon two kids manning a water table for a 5K race. I asked them how many runners were in the race, but they didn't know. They had about 20 paper cups of ice water on their table. I didn't see any of the runners, because they were coming from the other direction. That was a difficult route for a 5K, because the turnaround point for the race was at the bottom of a big hill, and the racers had to run the hill from both directions.I mentioned in my Thursday post an article in Runner's World that has a table giving the amount of fluid we should drink during a run to replace the fluid lost through sweat. The data in the table are based on scientific studies of sweat rates as well as tests made by the RW staff. For my run today, the table says I should have drunk 75 oz of liquid. I drank two swallows less than 80 oz. So, my use of four bottles today was just about right. I sweat a lot, and the table data seems to be close to my needs. I could tell that I did feel better because of the extra liquid I drank -- the heat didn't bother me at all. The cooler temperature helped, too.After I had returned home, I forgot to check the color of my urine as a check on the amount of water I drank during the run. When I was only drinking 40 oz of water & Gatorade, my urine after a run was a dark color, indicating I needed more fluid during the run. I'll probably be drinking 80 oz again next week, and I'll check the color of my urine when I return home.In past posts I've mentioned a big hill that is on the north side of the detour that goes through a residential neighborhood. I've been walking up the hill, but on Wednesday I ran all the way up the hill, and I did the same today. So, I am getting stronger. I'm glad to have some hills on my long run, because the GSL race will have a couple of small hills near mile 11. The big hill that I've mentioned is probably the largest hill during my run. There is another big hill just before my turnaround point (the hill mentioned above relative to the 5K race). My turnaround is on top of that hill, so I only climb the hill one time. There are a few small hills here and there during the run. Oh yes, the detour through the residential neighborhood has a downhill slope to the south, so I have to run it uphill on my return. It isn't a big change of elevation, but it lasts for about 1/2 mile. All of these hills are giving me some good resistance training.If any of you are local to the Salt Lake valley and would like a map of the detour, go to mapmyrun.com and search on jordan river parkway. Then select the link for Jordan River Parkway: South Jordan/Riverton Detour.There are four phases to running hills. First, you can't run the hill and you walk it. Second, you run the hill at a very slow jog. Third, you run the hill at a faster pace but slower than your normal pace. Fourth, you run the hill at your normal pace. I'm in phase 2 for the big hill at the north end of the residential area.Next Saturday will be my last 13-mile long run. I will taper for two weeks, and then run the Great Salt Lake Half Marathon on Saturday, August 19, 6:30 am in Clearfield, Utah. The race will be across the causeway to Antelope Island. I'm hoping to complete the race in 2:30 or less. To do that, I will have to reduce my pace by 1 minute per mile, compared to my time today.My wakeup HR was 50 this morning.Training Graphs"},

My fanny pack only holds 40 oz of liquid (two Gatorade bottles), so on Saturday I'm going to carry two additional bottles and throw them away as I empty them (there are quite a few waste containers along the Parkway). That will give me 80 oz of liquid, while the table says I should have 96 oz. If I need more liquid, I'll stop at the water fountain that is in the picnic area about a mile and a half from the end of the run.

I also had two kids follow me on their scooters for a minute. They asked me what I was doing. Then they asked me if I was running fast. I told them I was practicing for a race. I also saw a girl in a wedding gown having her picture taken by a rustic wooden bridge. I added a fartlek or kick for the last 200 feet or so of the run -- not a big increase in pace but an increase, none the less.Yesterday I bought an Etonic poly T-shirt, and I tried it out today to see how well it wicked moisture from my skin. I couldn't tell much while I was running, because I was sweating so much that the fabric was saturated with moisture. However, as the temperature dropped during the last half of the run, I felt a bit cold on my back, and when I got home I felt a bit cold on the upper part of my body.

Most of my running was in direct sun with only spots of shade here and there, and the direct-sun temperature was probably 125 or more (F). By the time I got home, the sun had moved past my kitchen window, and I couldn't measure the temperature of the direct sun.

When I left home about 7:30 am, the shade temperature was about 74 (F). When I returned the shade temperature was 86. My wakeup HR was 52.I ran the Jordan River Parkway and enjoyed the cooler morning air. There was a light breeze blowing, and a lot of runners, walkers, roller bladers, and bikers were out. I ran the 11 miles in 2 hours 21 minutes for an average pace of 12:49, including walking breaks and a brief stop to watch an artist work on her painting of a marsh. That finishing time extrapolated to 13 miles would be 2 hours 47 minutes, a bit faster than my 12 mile run on Wednesday and my 13 mile run a week ago. I didn't make any effort to go faster. I just let my body dictate the pace.I didn't eat any food before I left home, because I wanted to test my theory from last week that eating food just before I leave puts a burden on my body and causes me to run slower. I felt tired during the run, and I can't draw any conclusions about not eating food. Two nights ago, I didn't get enough sleep, and that may have been a factor, too. I did sleep well last night, but it usually takes several nights of good sleep to overcome the handicap of a night of insufficient sleep.Since I began running on the Parkway, I've noticed an interesting phenomena about human nature. When I pass a group of walkers/runners going the opposite direction, I always smile and say \"Hi\". The women usually return the greeting. The men, however, usually don't say anything.I only have three more Saturday long runs before my taper week and the half marathon on August 19. The time is going fast.Training Graphs"},

There is one place where the Parkway path comes to an end because the State couldn't get the right-of-way through a large pasture. Persons using the Parkway take a detour through an adjacent neighborhood (up the big hill that I've spoken of). I haven't run the Parkway enough to remember all of the turns, and on the way back I missed a turn and went a mile the wrong way. I was still on an asphalt path with a yellow stripe down the middle, but that path was a side-path to the main path and went in a different direction than I wanted to go. I had to back-track to the turn I had missed. I had to make a choice between running 10 and walking the last two miles or running the full 12 miles and doing a reduced distance on Saturday. I felt fine as I ran, and I chose the latter. So, today was a 12-mile run and Saturday will be an 11-mile run.I felt pretty good during the 12 miles and 90 (F) temperature, and I've felt fine since I got home a couple of hours ago. My time for the 12 miles was 2 hours 41 minutes, which interpolated to 13 miles would be 2 hours 54 minutes, very close to my time last Saturday. I purposely ran a bit slower today to reduce the stress on my body, compared to last week when I ran faster. So, everything considered, it was a good running day! My wakeup HR was 52 this morning.I have a new theory about eating before a run. As I've mentioned in previous posts, I've been experimenting with eating just before a run. A banana and a piece of bread seemed to be ok, and a granola bar during the run seemed to be ok, too. Last week, I didn't eat anything before the race, and I had lots of energy. This morning I ate a banana just before I left, and didn't have much energy for the first 3 or so miles. I had more energy during the rest of the run. I've noticed that pattern in the past when I've eaten a banana just before leaving: less energy during the first part of the run and more energy during the middle and end of the run. I'm wondering if eating a banana just before I run is impacting my body for the first part of the run. I'll experiment with this.I saw a mother duck and a bunch of ducklings on the path. The ducklings were small and were born late in the season; maybe two weeks ago.Training Graphs"},

I took it slow to warm up. My pace for the second mile was about 11:30. During the third mile I had to walk up the big hill, and my time when I reached the end of mile 3 was exactly 36 minutes. At the end of mile 5 my time was exactly 60 minutes. At that point I decided it was too hot to push myself so I slowed down and ran a comfortable pace for the rest of the run. My pace for the first five miles was also at a comfortable pace, just a faster but still comfortable pace. I finished the 13 miles in 2 hours 53 minutes for an average of 13.3 minutes per mile. That time included walking breaks at each mile, where I drank water and/or Gatorade (a total of 40 ounces of liquid during the run), walking up the big hill from both directions, and 3 or 4 extra walking breaks at 1/2 mile markers. Considering the heat, I think I did well. I wasn't as tired today as I have been in the past.For about a hundred feet, I had two running partners. A mother duck and her big duckling were on the path. There were lots of thick bushes between the path and the river, and the ducks didn't know what to do, so they just kept walking in front of me. Finally, the duckling turned into the bushes. The mother duck continued on the path for about 10 feet, and then she took to the air and flew to the river.When I got back to my car, I found a shady spot to do my stretches -- the steel tunnel for the Parkway path that goes under the residential street that borders the parking lot.Training Graphs"},

It is an asphalt path and is easier for my stiff ankles to run than the canal road which has small rocks and uneven surfaces. The hardness of asphalt and concrete doesn't seem to bother my body. Also, many more runners, bikers, walkers, and roller-bladers are on the Parkway than on the canal road, and if I have a heart attack and die my body will be found within a short time rather than the day or two it might take on the seldom-used portions of the canal road :) I have an ID tag on my shoe giving my name and several phone numbers.I finished the 13 miles in 2 hours 51 minutes and cut off about 25 minutes from my time last Saturday.

I felt great up to 10.5 miles, and then I started to suffer from the heat with a few brief dizzy spells. The dizziness only lasted for 2 or 3 seconds. On the way back I did extra walking during a few shady spots and drank extra water/sports drink (40 oz. during the run). One shady spot was about 300 yards long, and another was about 100 yards. I really enjoyed them!I saw lots of ducklings, including one batch that was born about a week ago. Most of the ducklings are 3-4 weeks old and are getting pretty big.

The shade temperature was in the mid 50s. Because of rain last night, I expected the canal road to be muddy so I used the long city street that I've mentioned in the past. I had a 10-15 mph headwind going out, and then the wind shifted and became a 5 mph headwind on the way back :(During the first five miles, I felt strong and my body wanted to go faster. I decided to let my body set the pace so I could see how long that strong feeling would last. During the 5 miles, I ran a pace from the high 11 minutes to the low 12 minutes, and a few times I peaked at the high 10 minutes. I even ran up the first of two elevated switch-back sidewalks that cross over busy highways (about a 20 foot elevation change). But, by the time I completed 6 miles, my strength was declining, and at 6.5 miles I turned around. I did a lot of walking on the way back, short walks of 30 seconds or so to give my body a brief rest, and I walked all of the last 1.5 miles. I could have jogged most of that last part, but I decided to walk and spare my body some stress.Overall, I'm pleased with the run. If I had gone slower on the way out, like I usually do, I would have done better on the way back, but I was curious to see how my body would hold up. In addition, my higher wakeup HR means my body was still tired from a few days ago. I slept well last night, though, and that should help my recovery over the weekend.On Monday I won't have time for any running, so I'll skip my 5-mile rest run and take a complete rest on that day.

Last week, I got about 6 1/2 hours sleep each night, including Friday night before my long run yesterday. That sleep wasn't quite enough, and my wakeup HR was elevated a bit during the week to 50/51. However, I took an hour nap after yesterday's run and got a good 7 hours last night, and my wakeup HR this morning was back to its \"normal\" 49.Last fall, while I was increasing my mileage from 7 miles to 10 miles, my pace would be 11-13 minutes, usually in the 12 minute range but frequently in the 11 minute range. After I reached 10 miles, my body couldn't handle the increased stress, and I had to drop back to 8 miles and slowly work back up to 10 and then on to 15 miles. I also had my gall bladder removed in November, and that increased the stress on my body. During the spring, my pace was usually 12 to 14 minutes. Yesterday, even though it was hot, I felt good during my run and felt a strength in my body that I hadn't felt since last fall before I got to 10 miles. My pace yesterday varied from 11 to 13 minutes, and I felt like I did last fall before I got to 10 miles.Another way that I can tell that I'm getting stronger is how my feet react to the running. I started running when I was about 38 due to pain in my feet. I had always walked a lot during my earlier life, but when I finished college I got a car and began driving everywhere. Over time, my feet began to hurt when I would be on them for extended periods such as during yard work for several hours. I was told by a specialist that the muscles in my feet were weak and that I should do what ever I wanted to strengthen the muscles. I began running, a natural extension to all of the walking I had done in my younger life. Running really helped my feet. The threshold for the foot-pain was pushed out, although my feet would still hurt if I stayed on them for a really long time. During the two years that I ran marathons (3-4 years of marathon training), my feet felt fine after I did yard work or completed a long hike with my scouts (I was scoutmaster for 12 years in Massachusetts).However, after I stopped marathon training and my mileage slowly came down to just a few miles per week, my feet started hurting after a few hours of yard work. The pain would come after periods of rest, not during the activity. This is a syndrome known as the \"squeaky door\" syndrome. My feet felt fine during activity but became stiff and painful during periods of rest, just as a rusted door is hard to open (no movement) and you have to push extra hard to get the door moving. Once the door begins to move, it moves more freely.I've noticed during recent weeks, especially after I got my mileage past 10 miles, that my feet were stiff and painful the morning after my long run, even though they felt fine during the run. The pain was usually gone 24 hours later, but the stiffness after periods of rest remained during the week. At work, I sit at my desk and do computer programming. After two or three hours of sitting, if I get up to walk somewhere, my feet are stiff, and it takes a couple minutes of walking to loosen them up. I do my long runs on Saturday, and on Sunday morning, when I first get up, my feet are stiff and painful, but after a couple minutes of walking, the stiffness is gone and the pain is reduced to just a \"tender\" feeling in my feet. After 24 hours the \"tender\" feeling is gone, but the stiffness remains during the week. I look like a really old man when I get up and walk around :)This morning was a pleasant surprise. When I first got out of bed, my feet had no pain and almost no stiffness. That is a good sign that my body and feet are getting stronger. It will be interesting to see if this \"good sign\" continues and improves in subsequent weeks.Training Graphs"},

Later that evening, I went to mapmyrun.com and checked the mileage from that point to the pumping station at the head of the canal. The distance was within the mileage for my turn-around point for a 15-miler. Great! I thought; I'll drive to that point and run to the pumping station and up the hill to Thanksgiving Point. At last, I will reach my dream!So, this morning I drove to my stopping point last week and started running. Two miles later I was stopped by a gate across the path. I respect private property and gates, so I found a short detour around the gate, using city streets, and continued running. A mile later, another gate! By this time I was getting away from the city streets and there was no easy detour around this gate, unless I wanted to climb a fence and bushwhack through sage brush. So, I turned back and said good by to the Salt Lake Canal as a way to Thanksgiving Point.On the way back to my car, I noticed another canal not far away (I'm out far enough that the canals are merging close together to go through the Point of the Mountain and into the Jordan Narrows) and a maintenance road next to the canal. I drove around until I found that maintenance road. This canal is the one that goes through the valley following the general path of 13th West. Before I started running this new road, I talked with a man and asked if it was ok to leave my car in front of his house. He said, \"Sure!\" While talking with him, I learned that that road is a private road and goes into a new gated community. So I gave up on that canal as a way to Thanksgiving Point. The man suggested that I run the Jordan River Parkway. I had looked for the parkway last week and drove right by the trail-head without seeing it. He said the trail-head was less than a mile away.I drove to the Jordan River Parkway and ran about 3 miles north. I couldn't go south, because the trail-head on 146th South is the end of the parkway (for now; eventually the State will have it through into Utah County -- the goal is to have it connect Ogden, Salt Lake City, and Provo, a distance of 70 or 80 miles). The parkway is paved and goes through some pretty country -- 10-foot trees and tall bushes along portions of it. I went through a wetlands area and saw a Pelican in the water. The parkway has some nice hills, not large hills but big enough (maybe 20-25 feet high) to help me get used to them.My total distance was about 13 miles. My wakeup HR was 51."},

{"title": "The canals I run are named", "date": "Monday, May 29, 2006", "text": "My wakeup HR was down to 47, and I felt good. I ran 5 miles along the canal I've been using for the past few years. It was a beautiful day with temperature in the 40s (F). I ran 11 - 12 minute miles, stopped to pick up litter, and felt great! Lots of ducks and ducklings in the canal. I even relived my childhood for a couple of minutes (one of the perks of growing old). I found a piece of 1x1 about a foot and a half long. I threw it in the canal and watched it float downstream. When I was a kid, my friends and I floated sticks in the irrigation ditches to and from school. Many years later, while I was living in Massachusetts, we came west on a vacation to visit family. While in Cedar City, Utah visiting my mom, I took my four kids out for a couple of hours and we floated sticks down the irrigation ditches for about five miles.Since I've started to explore a second canal, I thought I'd better identify them. The canal I've been following is the Utah Distributing Canal. The canal I ran on Saturday is the Utah Salt Lake Canal. In my blog I will refer to them as the Distributing canal and the Salt Lake Canal. I ran the Distributing Canal this morning.Training Graphs"},

{"title": "Completed a good 15 miles", "date": "Saturday, May 27, 2006", "text": "This week has been a recovery week, although my wakeup HR was 52 this morning. Last Saturday I did 15 and ran out of energy towards the last part of the run. Today was different! I left earlier to avoid the heat, but as it turned out, there wasn't any heat to avoid. We're having a cold-front come through this weekend, and this morning during my run the temperature was in the high 40s (F), with a brisk 10 mph wind. It was a wonderful day for running. I still drank my 40 oz of liquid and ate a banana before I left, an apple around mile 4, and an energy bar around mile 7. I felt fine during the first 10 or so miles. During the next five miles I felt a bit tired, but nothing like last Saturday! My problem today was that my legs started to stiffen up. I ran the whole distance, though, only walking during my breaks after each mile. During my last mile, I felt a few sprinkles of rain, but the rain stayed away until I was home. During the last five miles I had a 10 mph head-wind that drained some energy from me, but my body still felt fine while I finished the run. The stiffening of my legs today was nothing like I experienced last November when I first went past 10 miles to 11 and then to 12.Before I left home this morning, I decided to drive to the point where I've been turning around on my 15-milers, and run 7.5 miles from there to a new turn-around point. However, after I had run a little over a mile, the canal road disappeared. I was hoping it would continue into Utah County and down to Utah Lake, but, alas, that hope has been dashed. So, I ran back to the car and drove home and left the car. I then ran east to the next canal and followed that canal road to the south. There were two places where the land owners (the canal company only has a right-of-way through the land) have gates across the canal road, but I was able to backtrack a bit and find detours around the gates.The new canal is about twice as wide as the canal I've been following, and, this year at least, it received its water about two weeks earlier than the other canal. This canal is also more scenic than the other canal, having larger bushes along the bank. This greenery made the canal look like a river in the eastern US. Beautiful to see and to enjoy as I ran this morning. There were lots of ducks and ducklings, and I saw some geese and a gosling. I also saw a seagull scavenging the canal bank. For those who aren't familiar with Utah history, I'll mention that we have lots of gulls living near the Great Salt Lake. In fact, they are part of recent Utah history. When the Mormon pioneers settled the Salt Lake Valley, they planted crops but were devastated when plagues of crickets devoured their crops. The sky darkened when hundreds (thousands?) of seagulls came. At first the pioneers thought the gulls would finish off their crops, but they were surprised, and grateful, to see the gulls eating the crickets. Because of that experience, the seagull is Utah's state bird.I think that next week I'll drive to my stopping point this morning and then explore the new canal to see how far south it goes. I feel like Lewis and Clark. They dreamed of reaching the Pacific Ocean, and I dream of reaching Utah Lake. According to the Google satellite maps, there is a dam across the Jordan river near the point where lake water enters the river. That dam controls the level in the river, and I'm curious to see where the canal companies take their water out of the river or lake.Later: I used mapmyrun.com to follow the new canal down to it's source at a pumping station in the Jordan Narrows south of Camp Williams. In fact I drove very close to there this morning. After the other canal road disappeared, I drove around the area to see if there were any good ways to get to the Jordan River. I drove past Camp Williams and turned off on the Jordan Narrows road and drove around. I saw a road to a pumping station (the road is on the west side of the river), but I didn't go there. Now, I know that that pumping station is the final destination of the canal road for the new canal. It looks like, from the satellite map, that the canal road goes all the way to the pumping station, reaching the station via the east side of the river, but I won't know for sure if the road does go to the station until I run it.I've been hoping I could find a way to run to Thanksgiving Point and have my wife meet me there for lunch and then drive us home. I would run point-to-point for 15+ miles rather than out for 7.5 miles and back. Thanksgiving Point, on the east side of the river, is only a mile or so south of the Jordan Narrows, so it might be feasible. The satellite map shows a road going from the pumping station through some gravel operations and up to the I15 access road that leads to Thanksgiving Point. Since I'm running not driving, I don't need a very good road to follow.Training Graphs"},

The shade-temperature was 74 (F) when I left, but the direct-sun temperature was 114 (F). When I got back the shade-temperature was 88. I couldn't measure the direct-sun temperature when I returned because my thermometer was no longer in the direct sun (I actually have two thermometers that share a common display in my kitchen. The outdoor thermometer is under my deck and is always in the shade. It has a wireless connection to my display in my kitchen next to a bay window on the east and south corner of the house). The kitchen unit picks up the direct morning sun.I drank 40 oz of liquid (half Gatorade, actually the Costco Kirkham version, and half water). I could have used another 8 oz if I had had it. During the last mile, I only had a couple of sips at the start of the mile. During earlier miles, I took a big gulp of each liquid.I'm still taking walking breaks at the end of each mile and drink my water and eat my Nature Valley Sweet & Salty Nut bar and my apple during those breaks. I also ate a banana before I left home. I took 3-4 extra walking breaks during long stretches (100 yards or so) of shade from rows of trees along the canal.I really looked forward to the liquid each mile, and it was well worth the 2 pounds of weight (at the beginning) to have the liquid available. There were a couple of times when I had brief (1-2 seconds) spells of dizziness from the sun, and I was worried about heat-exhaustion. However, I felt ok and didn't get a headache, which is usually my first sign of heat-exhaustion, so I didn't worry about them. If the dizziness had continued, especially if the length of it or the intensity increased, I would have become concerned. Because I run the canal, there are fences between me and the houses I pass, and it would be difficult to attract attention from someone who could get me extra water. However, there are major streets every mile or so, and I could detour to a house if I needed to. I watched the ducks and ducklings swimming in the canal, and I was envious of them. I would have liked to jump in the water, but the canal water isn't very clean.Even though my wakeup HR was 49, I got really tired and walked the last two miles -- I had no energy left for running. I tried to run a bit and found that all I could do was a faster walk, so I just kept on walking. I felt fine up to mile 9. At that point I could tell my calves were starting to tighten up. My energy level declined, and by mile 13, I was like a car out of gas :) I don't think I was fully recovered from my ordeal on Tuesday, and I'm sure the heat drained energy from me. Also, on the way out I had a 7-10 mph head wind (as usual, the wind died down before I turned around, so I didn't get the advantage of a tail-wind).Still, it was a nice run, even if a \"just made it\" run.Training Graphs"},

I couldn't see the last half mile of the canal road very well, but I knew it was relatively smooth, and I didn't have a problem running in the dark.I tried an experiment during this run. I had a piece of pizza an hour before I ran. I knew I shouldn't eat the pizza, but I was curious to see if the hour would be enough time for my body to handle the food while I ran -- it wasn't. I felt tired right from the beginning of my run, and I couldn't breath very well. I ended up walk-jogging the 5 miles, although I did run the last mile because I felt better. Since it was an evening run, the temperature was higher than it is on my morning runs, and that might have contributed to my tiredness as well as to my feeling better during the last mile since it was dark when I got home and the temperature was dropping.I saw two boys about 6 or 7 years old throwing rocks at a mother duck and her ducklings. I stopped and talked to the boys. I asked them, \"How would you feel if a big giant threw rocks at you?\" I then explained that the ducks are real animals and have feelings the same as us. They feel pain. They hurt and cry. I hope the boys will remember what I said and think about it as they grow older.My wakeup HR this morning was 49.Training Graphs"},

Not particularly energetic but not overly tired either. I'm still taking walking breaks every mile, starting with the end of mile 1. It's during the walking breaks that I drink fluid and eat whatever food I've brought with me.Now that I've met my goal of 15 miles for my long run, I plan to level off my distance and give my body three months to get used to the mileage. I'll probably vary the long run from 13 to 15 miles so I don't get into a rut of doing exactly the same thing each week. During these three months, my pace should increase as my body adapts to the distance, although I won't know for sure until I go through the three-months of training. I'm hoping to run the Great Salt Lake Half Marathon on August 19. However, I will run it only if my pace does get faster. My time today for 13.1 miles was 2 hours 46 minutes, for an average pace of 12 minutes. I would like to finish the half marathon in 2 hours 15 minutes or less, and that will require a pace of 10 minutes.I saw four deer. Seeing deer is common; they come down the mountains looking for food. I also saw quite a few ducklings in the canal, including four that were not with their mother.

When I lived in Massachusetts I did 15 milers year around. I'm hoping I can maintain long runs of 13-15 miles year around here, too.I could tell when I got up this morning that I was tired. My wakeup HR was up to 50, and I didn't have that \"spark\" of energy that indicates I'm in good shape. I was surprised that I was tired, because I've had good sleep the past few days (8 hours last night). However, on Wednesday night I didn't get enough sleep, and that probably was the cause of my being tired this morning. I've noticed in the past that there frequently is a 2 - 3 day delay in my feeling the effects of insufficient sleep. I decided not to abort the run but to do a lot of walking during the run. Instead of walking breaks every mile, I took them every half-mile, and a few times more often than that. Had I not done the extra walking, I would have had to abort the run.I didn't have a problem with diarrhea during the run. I drank water on the way out and a combination of water and Gatorade (small swallows from each bottle) on the way back. Hopefully, my body is getting used to the Gatorade.Another thing that made me tired during the run was the rototilling I did before I ran, and the moving of 45 bags of cow manure from my son's truck to the back of my yard. Each bag only weighed about 20 pounds, but it all adds up. Also, the rototilling only took about 15 minutes, but that took some energy, too.I saw the red fox that I saw last week, in the same place, too. This time she ran about 100 yards out into the field and hunkered down in the grass and watched me. After I passed the grove of trees from which she ran, she returned to the grove. She probably has a litter there. She is a beautiful animal. Long red tail with a white tip. On my way back, I passed the grove of trees, but she didn't run out. Maybe she has figured out that I'm ok.[later in the day] On my Wednesday run I saw a farmer's wife and kids getting their irrigation ditch ready for canal water. They had a \"ditch plow\" that was pulled by a horse. The kids were riding on the plow to give it weight. The plow cleaned out stuff from the ditch. Today I saw a different farmer cleaning out the filter that is at the head of his irrigation ditch. He said the canal will have water on Monday.Training Graphs"},

As it ran through the field, it stopped several times and looked back. It was a beautiful animal to see.My wakeup HR was 50 but I felt tired and did extra walking and ran slowly. I had a quart of water with me, and I took a swallow every mile. The last two swallows were taken 1/2 mile from home. Before I left, I ate a banana and a slice of dry toast. I carried an apple and ate it at the turn-around point.

I've never used sports drink before, so when I got home I drank 12 oz of Gatorade that my son gave me -- it tasted pretty good.A few comments on why I felt tired this morning before and during my run. I was tired last week due to not enough sleep. I did better Thursday night and Friday night on getting sleep, but it takes my body a few days to catch up with the sleep. Another factor is that on Thursday, while rototilling my garden, I tripped and fell backwards. With nothing to break the fall, my shoulders and back hit the grass covered ground pretty hard. It took me about 10 seconds to catch my breath before I could get up. Meanwhile, the rototiller continued moving and went through my wife's flowers. Fortunately it went between a rose bush and some tulips and didn't do much damage to the flowers. When I got up from the fall, I felt no pain anywhere, and I continued rototilling for another hour. When I went to bed that night, I could feel some tenderness when I lay on my back, and I had to sleep on my side, which I normally do anyway. That tenderness when I'm in bed is still there, and I expect that \"injury\" contributed to my tired feeling. The good news is that I don't feel any tenderness when I'm up from bed. My wife rubbed my chest and back this morning before I ran, and I didn't feel any tenderness, so the \"injury\" is internal somewhere. Hopefully the \"injury\", likely a bruise, will be healed in a few days.If all goes well next week, I'll complete week 16 of my marathon plan by adding a mile to my medium run and a mile to my long run. The following week, which will be the last I do from my marathon plan, will have a mile added to my rest run and a mile added to my long run. That will give me 5, 10, and 15 miles on Monday, Wednesday, and Saturday, respectfully. After that, I'll level off on adding distance and give my body several months to really get used to the 15-mile long run. At some time during the Fall, I'll add a fourth day and slowly bring it up to 5 miles.Training Graphs"},

I've known for years that I could eat bananas before running, because I did that during my marathons back east. I've been doing that recently, too. During the last couple of weeks, I ate one or two oranges and drank some fruit juice in addition to a banana. That worked fine. So, this morning I tried a boiled egg. I didn't have a banana to eat and I forgot to eat an orange or to drink juice. I felt fine and ran fine after the egg.

And, as my son reminded me, I also took last in everything since I was the only runner. This week was Week 13 of my marathon plan, and I ran a 13 mile long run this morning. I added 0.1 mile so I could say I ran a half-marathon. I did very well for the first 10 miles and then I started suffering from lack of water. During the last mile, a nice, gentle tail wind came up that gave me a \"push\" and helped to cool me a bit. The temperature when I got home was 66 (F), not particularly hot, but I hadn't brought water with me, and I suffered for that lack of foresight. Starting with next week I'll carry water on my medium and long runs. I've been thinking of water in terms of extreme temperatures, but it is also a factor of long distance. I only got about 6 hours of sleep last night, so when I got up, I drank water and juice, ate a banana and an orange and then took a nap before I left on my run. My wakeup HR was 52 when I got up.A new subdivision is being built along the canal, and the builder is putting in a bridge for a street to cross the canal. He has the foundation in but still has to put the road over the foundation. When I got there this morning, I discovered that he had dug a deep, wide trench across the canal road to install a large water pipe, and I had to climb over some dirt and go down in and then out of the trench. It was easy climbing and not a problem. Later I ran into some road construction that also required that I climb over dirt and go through a wide trench that had been dug across the road. Thus, when I got to my 6.5 mile point, I decided to avoid those two construction spots and not go back the same way but to take a loop through the town I was in and return home via the long, straight city street that I've mentioned a few times. It turned out that my return home was only 0.15 mile longer than my route along the canal road. I had already decided to add 0.1 mile to give me a half-marathon, so everything worked out fine, and I didn't have to walk extra distance to get home.Good news: I read in my local newspaper that the canal water will be turned on a week from tomorrow. That reference was to a nearby canal and not to \"my\" canal, but I assume all three canals that traverse the Salt Lake valley will get water at about the same time. This is a month earlier than a year ago. Good news, indeed!Training Graphs"},
{"title": "Positive Addiction to Running", "date": "Friday, April 07, 2006", "text": "I recently read a small book called Positive Addiction by William Glasser. Glasser said there are two types of addiction, negative and positive. Negative addiction is harmful to us. It is based on judgment and guilt and the feeling that we are worthless. Positive addiction, on the other hand, strengthens us and increases the quality of our life.Glasser gives the steps that lead to positive addiction about an activity, including doing the activity alone rather than with groups, and doing it for the pure enjoyment of the activity. If we run with another runner(s), for example, there is a tendency to compete and to judge. If our running partner is faster than we are, we will probably increase our pace to keep up with the other runner, and in so doing convince ourselves that the other runner is better than we are. If we run because we want to lose weight or to be on a school team, we will be in judgment of ourselves. We judge ourselves as being overweight. We judge ourselves as being slower (or faster) than the runners with whom we compete.Of course, we should run with others and we should run to achieve goals if those are our needs. Competition has its place in our lives, but we need to recognize that by its nature, competition is negative and judgmental.In addition to running for competition or to achieve other goals, we need to also run for no other reason than the pure enjoyment of running. If we are to be positively addicted to running, we have to accept ourselves for whom we are, without criticism and judgment. We have to learn to love our running and to allow our running to be a positive, strengthening influence in our lives. We can learn to become positively addicted to running, and by so doing achieve a new dimension of satisfaction in our lives!Training Graphs"},

Instead, I increased my breathing rate to get more oxygen. My normal breathing rate is two steps in, two steps out. While running I switched to one step in, one step out for four repeats and then my normal rate with extra big breaths, and then repeats of this sequence. I didn't do this for long distances, just a few repeats of the sequence, whenever I felt tired. The extra oxygen did help, and I felt fine up to mile 9. Then I started getting tired, and I took extra walking breaks along with the increased breathing rate. I made it home, and I didn't feel overly tired.This was the first time since last November that I had run 12 miles. In November, my legs were very tired and stiff, while my body felt ok. Today, my legs felt fine and my body was a bit tired. Overall, I think I did better today than in November. Next week if I feel fine, I'll do 13 for my long run.

The temperature was in the mid 30s (F) with a slight breeze and sunny. A beautiful spring day. My wakeup HR was 49, and I slept fine last night.My wife and I have been watching the Olympics, and I feel like I'm an Olympic runner in my own, slow Olympics. I'll never be anything but a local, plodder, but it's nice to do what I can. One thing I've always liked about running is that I'm only competing against myself. I'll never set new personal bests because I'll never run as fast as I did when I was running marathons in the early 80s. But, I can set PBs for each category of 5 years that I live through. Races have age categories, so I thought that I'd have them too. I just turned 70 last October, and my PB for a long-run for age 70-74 is 12 miles, set in November, 2005. I should beat that in seven weeks, including this week. I would beat it in five weeks, but my marathon plan has week 11 as a fall-back week followed by a recovery week. Thus, week 13 of my plan will end with my new PB for a long-run: 13 miles. Two weeks after that I'll do 15 and will then level off for a year. During that time I'll have to switch to PBs in weekly mileage, I guess. :)Training Graphs"},
{"title": "Yesterday I overused my feet", "date": "Sunday, February 12, 2006", "text": "I woke up last night three times to get a drink of water (I need a lot of water and drink 24/7 so to speak), and my feet were stiff and sore. I couldn't walk for a couple of minutes but just sat on my bed and wiggled my toes. This stiffness and pain in my feet was the original reason why I started running many years ago. I did a lot of walking in childhood up through college, but when I graduated, I bought a car and didn't walk much anymore. My feet muscles weakened and started to hurt when I did yard work. A doctor told me to do anything I wanted that would strengthen the muscles in my feet. So, I started running.Yesterday, after the great breakfast that I mentioned in my previous post, I was on my feet for 3 hours tuning my piano, and that required that I be standing (it was a Grand not an Upright -- I can sit and tune Uprights). Then I ran for 2 hours. The combination of the two activities was more than my feet could handle, and the overuse pains came again. I used to be able to handle, thanks to my running of long distance, quite a few hours of being on my feet, but with all of my hospital stays and surgeries the past year and a half, my feet muscles have weakened. Anyway, I'm still going to follow my marathon plan to get an idea of what the plan entails, but I'm going to only run three times a week like I've been doing. I'll be running the Monday, Wednesday, and Saturday of the plan. I thought I could handle a fourth day, since I've reduced the mileage of the first day, but I'm not going to chance it while I'm adding distance to work up to 15 miles.Even though my feet were stiff and sore last night, my wakeup HR was 51 this morning, indicating that my body, as a whole, is rested. I did sleep well last night. I would get up for a drink of water and then go right back to sleep.Training Graphs"},

I went out running 4 hours later, and I could tell as soon as I started that I was short of wind. After I warmed up, I did better in my breathing. My lack of energy during the run may have been due to my lack of sleep earlier in the week (it's common for lack of sleep to take more days for recovery than the days with insufficient sleep) or my run yesterday -- my body isn't used to running two days in a row.Training Graphs"},

I decided that my present mileage is more like the new week 6 rather than the old week 4. So, I planned to do 5 today, but I  started feeling a bit tired and turned around for a distance of 3 miles -- I didn't want to overdo it and mess up my 8 tomorrow. I didn't get enough sleep this week, and that contributed to my tiredness this morning (had a great sleep last night, though). My wakeup HR was 52 this morning, so my tiredness isn't great.My new marathon training plan has the runner running 6 days per week instead of 5. The runs are one long run that advances up to 15 and then to 20, one medium run that stays at 8, and four short runs, two 4 and two 5 milers. It's the same weekly distance as the old plan, but the miles are spread over an extra day, and there is one less medium run and two more light runs. The result being less stress for the same weekly mileage. Until I retire in June, I'll only be running the Monday, Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday runs. That gives me one long run that should be up to 15 by the end of April, one medium run of 8, and two short runs of 4 and 5 miles.Training Graphs"},

When I got home, I was starting to feel tired, but it was the \"good\" tired. There are two types of feeling \"tired\". The bad tired is when you feel like you can't run another step and that you're ready to give up running. The good tired is when you recognize your body needs a rest but your emotions tell you to keep on running.I saw two ducks (a male and a female) in the canal, swimming in runoff from the melting snow and rain. I don't know where they live during the winter, probably in the \"duck area\" on 1300 West and about 50 something South, where there are millions of ducks living in a canal that has water year around.Training Graphs"},

{"title": "Announcing a Marathon Training Plan", "date": "Friday, January 27, 2006", "text": "I've added to my site a training plan for those who want to run a marathon or a half marathon and enjoy that experience by not suffering pain or extreme tiredness during and after the race. Many training plans are designed to get a runner ready in just a few weeks to run a marathon, and in meeting that goal of a short training period, those plans require that the runner endure relatively high stress during the training. In contrast, my plan involves less stress and less risk of injury because it uses a longer training period.For example, one popular plan will get a person ready for a marathon with just 18 weeks of training. That particular plan involves high stress during the first month of training (16%, 14%, and 12% increases in long-run distance during the first three weeks), and the plan also has high stress during the remainder of the training due to fall-back weeks of reduced distance to give ones body a rest but then subsequent big jumps in distance to get to the point where the runner would have been if the fall-back weeks weren't performed. The increase after the first fall-back, for example, is an 80% jump in distance from the fall-back position, which translates to a 28% increase from the distance before the fall-back!My plan is based on the 10% and heavy/light rules of running, and my increases in distance are 10% or less. In addition, after my fall-back weeks, my plan has the runner returning to the distance just before the fall-back instead of jumping to a new distance.In order to provide marathon training with less stress and less risk of injury, my plan has a longer training period. It requires a minimum of 25 weeks for a marathon and 17 weeks for a half marathon. The plan is athttp://www.leigh.org/running/marathonplan.htmlTraining Graphs"},

Back then, we didn't have insulated winter boots, only thin rubber galoshes over our gym shoes. On the way home, I met a friend who had his rifle, so I turned around and went hunting with him.

I took a sick day on Monday because I was weak with little energy. On Wednesday evening at work I started feeling cold. I put on a wool sweater but couldn't get warm. After my half-an-hour drive home, I had a sharp pain in my stomach. The next morning I took some oxygenated water to kill any germs that might be causing the stomach pain and went to work on Thursday and Friday. I've been taking the oxygenated water each day since then, and the pain is gone this morning. The pain was gone yesterday morning but came back in the afternoon. I took the oxy water last night and had no pain during the night. I took some this morning and have had no pain so far. Besides killing germs, the oxy water helps restore the body ph to a more neutral value.My wakeup HR on Monday was 65+, but it came down to 55+ for the rest of the week. Yesterday is was 58, still higher than my normal 50.I think my problem this week is that I've pushed too much in increasing my distance, and my body finally had to tell me to back off. I'm going to level off at 10 miles for a month or so to get used to that, and then I'll slowly increase my Saturday run up to 15 miles. I just have to give my body more time to adjust.Training Graphs"},

The property used by the canal road is owned by the local property owners -- the canal company only has a right of way. One farmer wants his cows to graze on both sides of the canal, and during the late fall, winter, and early spring when the canal has no water, he closes a gate so his cows can cross the canal. I was expecting this and had my detour all figured out.I got pretty tired on the way back and walked/jogged the last two miles. I haven't run much during the past two weeks due to working on the ground for my new barn. The barn was installed yesterday, and I'm hoping to get back to my normal running. My wakeup HR was 52.On the way back, I saw two big dogs in the middle of the road. I ran towards them and stopped when they were about 30 feet away. They didn't bark or wag their tail; they just looked at me, and I just looked at them. I thought to myself, \"Now, what do I do?\" I said, \"Hello dog!\", and the biggest of the two immediately started wagging his tail and walked to me. I let him sniff my hand (keeping my fist clenched so if he tried to bite me he would have to bite my whole fist instead of just my fingers)so he would know I was \"ok\", and then I petted him. As soon as I started petting him, the other dog started walking toward us. The big dog walked a few feet away, and the other dog immediately stopped. I whistled to the big dog, and he came back for more petting. When the other dog saw that, he walked to us and joined our petting fun. They were very friendly dogs.

I was so close to the Bangater Highway that I went the last quarter mile to get there. Sure enough, the highway blocks the canal road. I looked at the Google satellite maps last night, and it looked like there was a dirt road that went east along the highway to 27th West. There is, but it is blocked by a chain-link fence that protects a large pond of water that is the water supply for the city of Riverton. The satellite maps also showed that a road called 3600 West might go under the highway. If that road is a dirt road, probably not. If it is a paved road, then yes. That road is only half a mile west of were I was standing next to the Bangater Highway, and I could see an underpass for 3600 West to go under Bangater. So, my new route will be the canal trail to 134th South, then west to 3600 West and south on that road. I probably won't be able to get back to the canal road, but that is ok. I'm near the end of the Salt Lake valley, in an area that hasn't been developed much. I should be able to go a number of miles with little traffic and few houses.I ran my comfortable pace, but the pace changed with my body conditions.

Today I had no stops except for traffic/lights and a brief visit with a lady who was walking her dog to inquire about the condition of the canal road to the south (she said the canal road is blocked by a new highway that was built a few years ago, and I will have to detour to the city streets to get across the highway). I felt fine running mile after mile to get home!The canal water was turned off over the weekend, and now there are large puddles in the canal.

However, when I recently reached 5 miles, I could tell my body needed more time to adjust to the higher mileage.

Also, I'll be going into surgery at the end of March for two hernias, and during April I'll have the first of 5 or 6 surgeries for skin cancer (basal cell). This means that I'll not be running for several weeks after the hernia operation and for a week after each skin cancer operation.

Six months and a week of running to get back to where I was. I think that is pretty good progress for an old geezer...If all continues to go well, I should be up to 7 miles in a month.

Both kids were on roller blades. The young had a dog on a leash that was pulling her. Her brother came along on his own power. When I got to them I said, \"I'll race you to the corner\". They laughed but didn't take me up on it (the corner was only 20 feet away).My wakeup HR was 53 this morning (54 yesterday). I missed a run in the middle of the week because I had a slight cold. On Tuesday morning I was scheduled to report for jury duty.

I was ok during the morning jury selection (I wasn't selected), but during the afternoon my nose started to drip. I took two days off work and rested.

I don't try to run at any particular pace, and I let my body determine how fast I run.When I first start running, my breathing pattern is 4-4, 4 steps (LRLR) as I breath in and 4 steps as I breath out. After the first mile, my breathing pattern goes to a 2-2 pattern. As with my pace, I don't force this pattern; my body just goes to it. Once in a while, if I need more oxygen when going up a hill or something, I'll do a 1-1 pattern, but I don't do it more than just a few times. Tonight, I caught myself doing a 1-2 pattern, one step as I breath in and two steps as I breath out. That's a strange pattern since it isn't symmetrical.Training Graphs"},

Usually when my HR goes that high it's because of lack of sleep. However, I've been getting good sleep. I can think of two possibilities for causing the HR to rise.1. During the New Years weekend I ate a lot of candy, chips, etc. It was a dumb thing to but at the time it tasted good :(  Foods with a high glycaemic value (high in sugars) cause an insulin spike, and this upsets your body chemistry. I'm not a doctor, but I would suspect this could affect ones heart rate.2. I've been running four months since my accident, and during that time, I've made very good progress in my running. I've consistently added 10-12% each week to my distance (one time I added 18%), and for the most part I've felt good during my running. It may be that it is time to give my body some extra rest. The running literature recommends that you take a monthly rest week to give your body extra rest. The literature recommends running heavy/light during each week, and then, once a month, decreasing the mileage during the week to run a light week. I haven't been doing that, and my body may have been signaling me to give it some extra rest.At any rate, my wakeup HR was down to 55 this morning, and I felt pretty good. I ran my 3 mile course and felt good at the end. The temperature was 32, and a light snow was falling (we have about 4-6 inches on the ground).

By taking the rest day when I felt tired, I gave my body two extra days of good sleep to recover, and today was a nice run. I really believe that you should take a day of rest when you feel tired, and some of the running literature teaches that!I've found that my wakeup HR is a good indicator of my body condition, but my 30 situps are a better indicator.

During the week I only had 3 hours sleep one night and two days later 5 hours (I got my normal 7 hours the other nights). I felt pretty good during the week, but I'm tired this morning. My wakeup HR was 52 and I'm skipping my run today. I frequently have a couple of days delay between the night I don't get much sleep and the day that my wakeup HR goes up and I feel tired. That happened this week. It took about two or three days after I messed up my sleep for my wakeup HR to move up. It started moving up and the next day it peaked, and the day after that it started back down. The good news is that I got my normal sleep on the other nights during the week. Because of that, my increase in wakeup HR didn't last long. I don't take drugs to help me sleep. Instead I take a homeopathic remedy called Nux Vomica. Nux is not a drug and has no side effects. It is a catalyst that helps my body get started in recovering from the lack of sleep.Because of this sleep disturbance, I will have run only run once this week. Some runners are hesitant to take an extra day of rest when they feel tired. They are worried their performance will go down. They have a good point since performance does go down when one is inactive. However, my experience has been that it takes about the same time to come back to my previous performance that it took lose that performance. That is, if I take an extra rest-day, my performance will be back up after one or two days of running. So, I don't worry about taking an extra rest day when I need it.

I expected my eating would affect my breathing, but it didn't. I ran out 0.8 miles on a slight uphill grade, and then I ran back the same course.

I think it will be harder to add 10% every week as my distance increases. I'm just grateful for any increase at all. After 4 1/2 weeks in intensive care I went to a different hospital for 10 days of therapy. When I made that change, I couldn't walk due to weak muscles and a loss of balance. During the 10 days I progressed from a wheel chair to a walker, then to a cane, and finally walking with no support. When I left therapy I could walk around pretty good, but I still had difficulty on stairs due to a loss of balance. In addition, moving my body weight up the stairs was still a challenge. During the next month I stayed at my sister-in-law's house, and I received physical therapy for balance and strength in my legs. In addition my wife and I began walking and worked up to 0.6 miles.

Last night the temperature was about 29F, and the sidewalks and streets were icy when I ran this morning. I usually run on the sidewalks, but I ran in the streets because the asphalt was rougher than the concrete sidewalks and gave better traction. The streets weren't solid ice, just small spots of ice mixed with small spots of dry asphalt, about equal amounts of each.My wakeup HR was 51, and I had a nice 1.25 mile run.

During that time, my wife and I walked about 0.6 mile each day.Tonight I did my first jogging since the accident. I mixed into my walking distance a very slow jog for 1/8 mile (a city block). It felt good to run again. Because of the short distance and slow pace I didn't put my running shorts on. I wore my running shoes and ran in my jeans and polo shirt. Tomorrow is a rest day, and I'll try it again on Saturday.This accident really screwed up my heart rate (HR). Before the accident, my wakeup HR was in the mid to high 40s and my HR during the day was in the mid to high 50s. Now, my HR during the day is in the mid to high 70s. Hopefully, as I gain strength my HR will come down. I haven't been measuring my wakeup HR, but I'll start doing that so I can see how it behaves.This high HR indicates my body is still stressed out and hasn't recovered from the accident. That fits in with my low energy level. I'm getting tired after a relatively short time of physical activity. I lost 20 pounds while in the hospital and have only gained back 5 pounds."},

{"title": "Gonna try a simple pulse rate monitor", "date": "Saturday, February 28, 2004", "text": "My sleep patterns still haven't recovered from last weekend when I only got 4 hours sleep. I went to bed earlier last night but woke up after 4+ hours and couldn't get back to sleep for quite a while. Even with a loss of sleep last night, my wake up HR was 48. I can tell, though, that my body is tired. Since I ran yesterday, today is a rest day.I bought a Tanita pulse rate monitor. It's a simple device that does only pulse rate; I put my finger over the sensor. I'm hoping this will save me a bit of time. I've been measuring my pulse rate using the pressure point by my right ear and my watch, measuring it for one minute. I would measure it two or three times to be sure I had a stable reading. The Tanita does it in about seven seconds; I can take several readings in the one minute that I needed for my first reading the \"old fashioned\" way. The wake up HR number I report in this blog will be the average of several readings. For the first few days, I'll also use my watch as a sanity check on the Tanita.Before I bought the Tanita, I took about a dozen readings of my pulse in the store. Then, I sat in my car and took about 20 more readings. After I got home, I've taking another dozen readings. The accuracy of the Tanita is about +- 1 (at best; accuracy may be worse).Ordinarily when I run I'm not concerned about measuring my pulse, because I run at my \"comfortable\" pace. However, when I start to to do speed work, I will be interested in measuring my pulse so see how much stress I'm putting on my body. Anyway, as a software engineer, I like to play with numbers and draw graphs of them :)"},

Because I was on my feet a lot yesterday, I could hardly walk this morning. The muscles in my feet were stiff as if each foot was a solid piece of concrete. This is a problem I've had all my life. It's called the \"squeaky door\" syndrome. Consider an old door that has hinges that are all rusty. The door will be hard to open, and you will have to push and push to get it to move. However, once it moves, it moves more freely, usually squeaking. So it is with my feet. If I over use them, as I did yesterday, my foot muscles tighten up, and I can hardly walk when I first get up the next morning. This morning, I took a homeopathic remedy called Rhus Tox (made from poison ivy), and as I walked around my feet muscles started to loosen up. I've been up for about seven hours, and my feet are still tender, but I can walk around and do my activities.Many years ago when I lived in Phoenix, I would spend seven or eight hours on Saturday on my feet doing yard work. On Sunday morning I wouldn't be able to walk due to the pain in my feet, and I would crawl into the bathroom. However, as I hobbled around the house, the pain and stiffness in my feet would go down. It would be Tuesday morning before the pain was gone and I could walk normally. I went to a foot doctor to find out why I was having such pain in my feet, and he said the muscles in my feet were weak, and I needed to do something to strengthen them. I began running and have been running ever since. The running didn't completely remove the pain, but it helped a lot. I still had some squeaky-door stiffness and pain, but not nearly as severe as it had been.Later, after moving to Massachusetts, and while I was a Scoutmaster, I was planning to take a week-long backpacking trip with my scouts. We were planning to backpack 50 miles during the week. Because of my condition with my feet, my wife told me I was crazy to carry a 40# pack for 50 miles. Fortunately a friend told me about Rhus Tox, and I took it with me on the trip. I had no problems with my feet until Saturday, the last day of the trip. During the week, we hiked hilly trails and climbed Mt. Washington in New Hampshire, the highest point in New England. On Thursday, I ran out or Rhus Tox, and on Saturday, as we hiked seven miles back to our cars, my feet started to hurt.During the two years I ran marathons, I don't remember having many problems with my feet. Now, since I'm running low mileage, I have some stiffness and pain when I'm on my feet a lot, but it isn't very bad. I only take Rhus Tox when I abuse my feet as I did yesterday."},

Later on, after I've leveled off my distance, I'll do speed training, and my pace measurements will give me an idea of the effect of my speed training.

I ran it in 33 minutes for a pace of about 10. I don't check my pace very often, because I run at my \"comfortable\" pace, but I like to check it once in a while. I can't explain what my \"comfortable\" pace is, but I recognize it when I reach it. It's the pace that feels \"just right\", like I'm able to run forever. On days that I feel good my \"comfortable\" pace is faster, on days that I'm tired, had insufficient sleep, or running against wind, it is slower. If you'd like to read about running the \"comfortable\" pace, click on the Training link and then on the Basics of Jogging link. Read the essay by George Sheehan. That essay was the first article I read in the running literature, and it has been my guide for the past 30 years.My wake up HR was 49 this morning. The temperature was 34 when I left and 39 when I returned. My course is basically out and back, but the back has some zig zags to get extra distance.

{"title": "My LSD is about 58% max", "date": "Thursday, February 05, 2004", "text": "I woke up with a HR of 49. After a couple of hours of doing things around the house, including going up and down stairs, I measured my HR just before I started my stretches that include 33 sit ups and 10 push ups. It was 50. After my stretches it was 52. After my 3 1/4 mile run at my long slow distance (LSD) pace of about 10 minutes/mile, my HR was 88. Using the traditional formula for max HR, my max is 220 - 68 = 152. My HR at the beginning of my run was 34% max, and my HR at the end was 58% max. That's about right for my LSD goal at this stage in my training. Later on after I have my weekly distance up to 33 miles, I'll start doing speed training, and during those bursts, I'd like to get my HR up to about 85% max or 129 or so. These numbers are interesting, but to me it's more important how I feel. During a LSD I should feel rested and should enjoy the run, and I do. I'm a firm believer in LSD while increasing distance!"},
{"title": "Wakeup HR has been consistent", "date": "Wednesday, February 04, 2004", "text": "Today is a rest day. My wake up HR was 50. My wake up HR has been pretty consistent during the past week. I think that's because I've been consistent in getting close to my seven hours of sleep. I've been measuring my wake up HR for almost the full 30 years that I've been running, and HR is very sensitive to sleep. Last fall I was only getting 5-6 hours of sleep, and my wake up HR was 55 or higher. As my HR goes up, my endurance and energy level go down. This is probably to be expected considering my age (68), but the same thing happened when I ran marathons at age 45-46.I'm currently running 3 1/4 miles of long slow distance (LSD) at 9 or 10 minute miles, and my HR doesn't vary much during the run. I'm working up to 6 miles three times a week, and I'm not doing any speed work while I'm increasing my distance. Both increases in distance and speed increase the stress on my body, and I'm controlling the amount of stress by changing distance or speed but not both together. After I get up to the 6x3 distance and run it for a couple of months, I'll add a fourth day starting at 1/2 mile. When that day gets up to 3 miles, I'll add a fifth day and take it from 1/2 mile to 3 miles. At that point, I'll be running 6, 3, 6, 3, 6 (heavy/light) for 24 miles/week. At that point, I'll begin my marathon training and slowly increase my 5th day up to 15 miles. After I reach that point (33 miles/week) I'll level off and run that year around. After a year or so then I'll begin training for the St. George marathon and work during the spring and summer to get up to 45-50 miles per week, extending the 6 miles to 10 miles, the 3 miles to 5 miles, and the 15 miles to 20 miles (just one time for the 20 miler about a month before the race).When I level off at 33 miles per week, I'll begin to do speed work, but I'll only do heavy speed training once a week (now that I'm older, maybe once every two weeks. It depends on how fast I recover).This plan for marathon training may not seem very exciting to you younger runners, but It's the plan I used in running marathons back in '81 and '82, and it's my way of running pain and injury free. It's a slow plan, but it works for me."},

It could be the increase in distance that I did on the 24th, or it could be that I didn't get quite as much sleep this week as I need. Additional distance (or speed) and lack of sleep put a greater stress on my body, and this reduces my endurance. If the lack of sleep is up to half an hour, it may not affect my waking HR much, but if it is more than that, it does increase my HR."},

For the past month, our daytime temperatures have mostly been below freezing.Since today is a rest day and I won't be running, I thought I would relate a nice experience I had a couple of weeks ago while running. There is a section of my 3-mile route that doesn't have houses around it. I was running down that section and a Golden Eagle flew over me and landed on the telephone pole just in front of me. It had been perched on the pole that I had just passed. As I neared the pole, I walked slowly toward it and got within about 20 feet of the pole before the bird flew to the next pole. When it flew over me, and then when it flew away as I walked toward it; it was about 22 feet in the air. I have a good estimate of the height, because I used to work part time as an outdoor tech for the phone company, and the telephone cable on the poles is 18 feet in the air. The top of the pole is around 26 feet high, and the bird dipped a bit as it flew from pole to pole. A beautiful sight!There were a few times, when I was running in Shrewsbury, MA, that I saw a Golden Eagle. The bird was perched in a particular tree along a rural stretch of road, and it would fly away as I approached. I only got within about a hundred feet of it, but it was beautiful to see and watch as it flew away.Massachusetts, because of all the trees, has many wild animals, and I've seen, while running, foxes, skunks, porcupines, opossums, and, of course, lots of gray squirrels, along with a variety of birds. While running here in Utah, I saw a coyote and now the eagle. Oh, yes, I've seen lots of Canadian Geese in both Massachusetts and Utah. In Massachusetts they were usually flying overhead in their V formation, but in Utah they are in the fields foraging for food; I walk slowly past the fields and get within 50 feet or so of them before they fly away. One day they flew right over me and were only about 15 feet in the air -- that was exciting!"},

When I ran against the wind, the effective wind was about 14 mph and a chill factor of 6. I could feel the difference on my face when I ran against or with the wind. I ran past several houses with flags and noticed how much they were waving in the wind, so I could use them in the future to gage wind velocity.

When I was married 40 years ago, I weighed 149. Twenty years later when I was running marathons in Massachusetts I was 157. Twenty years after than, I'm now up to 163. My weight should come down a bit as I get into longer distances, but I'm ok as is.  I've never drunk much soda, but I've completely given it up for nutritional reasons. I've never eaten a lot of candy, but baked goods and ice cream have been my weakness. I'm cutting way back on the baked stuff and ice cream, and I'm eating moderately as I always have done. I also take Juice Plus+ and aloe vera to insure that I have proper nutrition. During the past two years, I've noticed I don't need as much food, an aspect of getting old I guess. That is probably the reason for my gain from 157 to 162. One of the reasons I like to run is that it has made me more health conscious."},
{"title": "My wakeup HR hasn't risen much as I've gotten older", "date": "Friday, January 23, 2004", "text": "I normally would have run this morning, but my wife and I are leaving for an early morning church activity, and we'll go directly to our work. I'll run tomorrow. My wakeup HR this morning was 52. When I started running marathons about 22 years ago, my wake up HR was 44. After my first year of marathons (two marathons that year) my HR dropped to 40 and remained there during the next year (two more marathons). So, after 20 years of short distance running, my HR is still pretty low for an old guy my age."},
{"title": "Here is my running strategy", "date": "Thursday, January 22, 2004", "text": "My HR this morning was 49. Today is a rest day. I'm running three times per week. When I get up to about six miles, I'll level off at that distance and run it for a couple of months to build a base. Then I'll add a fourth day, starting at half a mile, and I'll slowly build up the fourth day to three miles. After a couple of months I'll add a fifth day and build it from half a mile to three miles. That will give me three six milers and two three milers per week (24 miles). After three      months of building a good 24 mile base, I'll start my marathon training by      extending one of the six mile days to a long run of 15 miles (33 miles per      week).After a year of 33 miles, I'll sign up for the St. George(Utah) marathon in the fall of the year. During the preceding summer I'll extend the 15 mile long run up to 20 miles and the other distances up a couple of miles, peaking about a month before the marathon. I'll just run the 20 miler one time. During that last month I'll taper back to 15 miles for the long run but will keep the other distances at their extended values. After the marathon I'll go back to the 33 mile base and will keep it during      the winter. When spring comes, I'll start to work up to another marathon that fall.This is the plan I used for my four marathons in New England and it worked well for me. I'm older now (68) and need more time for increases in distance and for recovery periods. Also, I'm running at a 5000 foot elevation instead of the 300 foot elevation of my former home in Massachusetts, and that means I need more time to build up endurance. The good news is that St. George is only 3000 feet. That decrease of 2000 feet means I'll be running the marathon with more oxygen than I'm getting now.      Elevation does make a difference. A few years ago my wife and I visited our kids in New England and I ran a few miles in Connecticut. I could tell that I was running better than I did in Utah.I'll probably be 70 or 71 when I do another marathon. Years ago when I finished my third marathon, I was happy that I'd finished it a few seconds less than four hours. While I was walking around recovering from the run, I saw an old man standing nearby. I asked him what his time was, and he said 3 hours 59 minutes and 50 something seconds. That was my time almost to the second! I asked him his age and he said 83. Ever since then I've had a goal to run a marathon under four hours at age 83. Right now I'm      running four miles at age 68. That means I have fifteen years to pick up      another 22.2 miles :-) A great goal to keep me going.I don't plan to do any speed training while I'm preparing for my next marathon. It's risky, especially for an older person, to mix increases in distance with increases in speed. However, after I've done the marathon I'll do some speed work to bring down my time. I'm hoping to do one marathon per year. Maybe I'll get the world record for a marathon at age 100..."},
{"title": "Ran 3 miles through the town", "date": "Wednesday, January 21, 2004", "text": "I work afternoons and evenings, so I do my running in the mornings. My wake up heart rate (HR) today was 50 so I was rested and was ready to run (had a good seven hours of sleep last night, my normal amount).After doing my routine of stretches, I left home about 10 am and ran 3 miles through the streets of my town. I usually run along a canal to get away from houses and cars, but we have about 6 inches of snow on the ground and I'm running the streets until the snow melts. I don't know how fast I ran or how long the run took because I never look at my watch. I just run and enjoy it. The temperature was a few degrees below freezing during the run. I started with two T-shirts and a wind breaker, but about half way through I removed the breaker. I felt good at the beginning but was starting to get cold by the end of the run.There are some dogs that live by the canal, and they come out and bark. I stop and make friends with them by talking with them, and they were starting to not bark as much. Then the snow came. When I go back to the canal road, I'll probably have to start over making friends with them. In my 30 years of running, I've never had dog problems; rather, I've always enjoyed seeing them. When I lived in Massachusetts, there was a big dog that would come out and run with me for about five miles. This went on for several months. Then one day, he stopped coming; I never learned what happened to him. It was sad to not see him any more!I run past three pastures with horses, and I've been thinking I should bring some carrots to feed them, but I keep forgetting to bring the carrots. Oh well, maybe next time. Before the snow came, I was running four miles along the canal, and I'll go back to that distance when the snow is gone."},
