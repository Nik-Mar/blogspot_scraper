{"title": "The Angst of Finding a Great Book Title: If You, Like Me, Don't Score High at This All-Important Task, Some Tips to Try", "date": "Friday, June 30, 2023", "text": "OK, I admit. I am not the best when it comes to book titles. Occasionally, I score. But most times, in my publishing history, editors or agents have changed my proposed title. Radically.Case in point: When my second novel was ready to be shopped to publishers, my agent emailed me with a big problem—the title. I had written the novel under the title of OUTLAWS. I loved that title because it represented all the bad-ass glory I love in women who are heroes at heart. I embedded the theme of outlaws into the story, placed it (very occasionally) in dialogue as a marker for the reader to go “Ah-ha! That’s why the title.”But she didn’t like it. Editors would be confused, she said, thinking it was a Western. Which it most certainly is not. It’s about an indie musician on the run from a murder-frameup and her estranged sister who has to hide her, against her better nature. Both women are pilots. My mom was a pilot, and she had a little of that free spirit I imagined for these two characters. So OUTLAWS was a tongue=in-cheek, rather brilliant way, of alluding to that heroic nature.Thelma and Louise. Butch Cassidy. Society’s outcasts who win our hearts. Right?My agent wasn’t having it.Read more »"},
{"title": "Organizing the Mess of a Book:  Four Methods for Staying Sane and Focused", "date": "Friday, June 16, 2023", "text": "The two most common questions I get: (1) how do you find your ideas and (2) how do you keep it all organized?I used to write a weekly food column for the Los Angeles Times syndicate. My job was simple: come up with 600-1000 words about something related to food, design and test one or more recipes to go along with it, and send it off to my editor. Other than the natural mess recipe-testing makes in a home kitchen, I didn’t have much to organize. I liked the ease of the weekly deadline, I loved eating the leftovers from testing or inviting a bunch of friends to come over and share. My column got noticed. I got asked to contribute to books. That was my first foray into the world of 300-pages of writing. My first moment of understanding how big and unwieldy a book-sized writing project can get.Early days, I just put parts together and sent them off to my editor to organize. I wasn’t able to—or interested in—seeing the big picture. Then I got approached by a larger publisher and asked to not just contribute but write a whole book myself. I’d be assigned an editor, but I was responsible for delivering the manuscript by deadline, all 90,000 words of it.That was back in the Stone Age of file folders. I brainstormed my chapters and wrote each on the outside of a paper file folder, in a circle. Then using a method some call clustering or mind mapping, I designed the parts of the chapter as spokes radiating from the title in its circle. Then I began my research. Each piece of information—since these were food topics, I might research the history of the kiwi fruit, for instance—went physically into the file folder for the chapter where it would live. My interview notes got distributed the same way. I didn’t begin actually writing until the folders were fat and I had plenty to work from. I knew if I had to look at a blank page on my computer screen, I’d lose confidence fast. The contents of each file folder was spread on a table, and I created a possible order for all the pieces. Sometimes I wrote bullet points for each piece on an index card so I could just shuffle those instead (an early storyboard).After I had most of my material and a rough order planned out, I’d sit down and begin entering everything into the computer. Again, each chapter got its own computer file. I didn’t arrange the chapters in any final order yet—I wanted to see how they’d line up with their contents in place.The first draft was pretty awful, usually. But I made sure I got it written then printed out. I edited on the hard (printed) copy and input corrections into a new Word document on my computer. There was a master file for the manuscript, individual files for each chapter, then all the chapter (and manuscript) revisions. By the time the book was ready to send to my editor, I had a file drawer of drafts and revisions and many, many electronic iterations. Incredibly cumbersome. But it wasn’t a bad system. I wrote five books this way, all published, selling well for years. I remember moving from the house where I did most of those books and struggling to throw out all the paper copies with their edits. It felt like destroying history.Organizing my writing this way continued for a few more books, until I got to my first contract for a book that wasn’t about food. The publisher I approached said yes to my proposal for a self-help/spirituality hybrid. I was thrilled—until I realized I had no idea how to structure it.Some of you who’ve been in my classes have heard this next step: A writing friend gave me a book called A Writer’s Time by Ken Atchity. The genius of A Writer’s Time is the concept of writing in islands or snippets of ideas, scenes, information. It makes good use of the random brain, the flow (unorganized) part of our creativity. I brainstormed islands and created enough to fill the book. Again, my file folders came out and I created my chapters, the circled title and the spokes of topics within. Then index cards to start a sequence of chapters.There I stalled. Organizing the flow of this new book was not like arranging the courses of a meal. Again, someone in my lovely writing community told me, just in time, about storyboarding. I learned my first storyboard in the shape of a giant W, with rising and falling action. It’s said that Joseph Campbell first tried this method. If you google storyboard W you’ll see how the idea has taken off. Using my index cards at first, then Post-it notes for more ease, I arranged the rising and falling action of my book on the storyboard chart. Here’s a video about it, if you’re new to the whole idea. It was new to me but it’s not uncommon now—a method used in screenwriting, filmmaking, editing. I remember seeing my first storyboard at an ideation session for one of my food books. We gathered in a conference room at the publisher’s and on the wall were large white sheets of poster board, arranged like an empty cartoon. We literally sat there for eight hours and filled them in. Voila, a book.These were good techniques for organizing massive amounts of writing, yet I was ecstatic when I discovered yet another, better way to keep sanity around a book project: Scrivener. I’ve devoted many posts to the glory of Scrivener as a writer’s organization tool, and I can’t recommend it highly enough. I’ve written five books using it. It hasn’t failed me yet. Gwen Hernandez was one of my first online teachers and she’s excellent if you want a tutorial or class to get going with it. I love writing books and will keep doing it for a while. Sometimes, though, I think longingly of the past, those 600-word columns.  Or the short stories I write now, just for a break. Short pieces of writing are easily gathered in file folders.  Even multiple revisions or printed pages from feedback become simple revision lists.  While a book used to take up at least one file drawer, forty-five of my short story drafts fit into one woven shelf basket in my writing room.I also sometimes long for the tangible, the feel of printed paper and not a keyboard. I never would go back to a typewriter but I do miss the satisfaction of a pile of completed pages stacked on my desk. Your Weekly Writing Exercise: browse the recap of methods, plus a few new ideas, below and use them as fuel to explore your current organization and what it might be missing. Pick an idea that interests you and try it out, even a little.Method 1: Project BoxTwyla Tharp is famous for this method--each choreography project gets its own new box.  Into that box she puts all her notes, objects, fabric samples, videos, anything that has to do with the project.If the container is big enough and inspiring to your creative self, a project box works for a book.  One stalled-out day, when I couldn't write, I collaged the outside of a large wooden box and tried it for a year.  Images on the collage led me back into juicy writing time after time.Method 2: One or More Bulletin Boards I read about a writer who starts her book with seven bulletin boards in her kitchen (big kitchen, I thought).  She pins everything to them that has to do with the book.  Images, lists, sketches, photographs, diagrams.  As she writes the book, she condenses the number of boards to one, discarding all the material that doesn't actually fit the book now.Anything easily visible--a board on a wall--helps the writer keep the book at close attention. Method 3: Old-School File FoldersUsing the method described above, try file folders as organizing tools later in the book process.  Once your have chapters organized in your computer, create a folder for each.  On the outside of each folder, brainstorm ideas—let yourself fly with this, no holding back. Or try my method of a circle with spokes coming off.  In the center of the circle is the chapter's purpose (or title if the purpose is still evolving).  On the spokes are the scenes or points the chapter now includes.  Add and subtract as you revise. Inside the folder are the research notes, photos, images, lists of ideas, anything you want to keep in mind as you continue to write.Method 4: Scrivener or Other SoftwareSome writers combine Scrivener with other software, such as Aeon Timeline (great for figuring out different thru lines in a story) or Devonthink Pro, which comes highly recommended by one of my online students, although I haven't used it yet. But new software comes out constantly so do your research.Software includes learning time, It helps if a writing buddy can show you the ropes.  I was fortunate to get great help for Scrivener setup during one of my workshops.We all have a great deal of personal freedom with what we choose to write--or do we? I've spoken with many writers, of all genres, who are conscious of the reader looking over their shoulder, judging their words. Or family, people they want to include (fictionalized or real), who may get hurt or shun them for the way they tell their story. Some writers don't care. \"It's my story, I lived it, and I can tell it however I like,\" one student told me. More power to you, I thought. I knew her as a forthright activist, never shying from truth telling and confrontation. I'm not that way, and maybe some of you aren't either. You may, like me, worry a bit (or a lot) about judgment.Read more »"},
{"title": "It's All Too Much! (Risk, That Is):  Recognizing and Balancing the Risk Quotient in Your Writing (and Your Life)", "date": "Friday, June 9, 2023", "text": "Long ago, I wrote a book called How to Master Change in Your Life, which is, as you probably guessed, about how different people view and react to change of all kinds. One of the more fascinating parts of my research for that book was what I began to call the risk quotient of each person. Including myself. Evidently, there can be a vast difference between how we deal with external risk (driving across Europe alone) and internal risk (telling a friend that we can’t be friends anymore). Since the book was published, I’ve kept that fascination with risk. I use it to weigh my characters’ effectiveness in a story. I evaluate how much external risk I’ve put in the plot—how many dramatic moments, how intense or low-key they are. I’ve studied my own tendencies towards different kinds of risk. Is it a male-female thing? Is it influenced by location? Or class or education or race? When I taught writing, I sometimes asked students about their tendencies to allow risk into their stories. I noticed a real difference in the answers when I taught, say, in Minnesota versus New York. I began wondering if the place we live reflect or instructs our tendency to bring risk into our creative work. Does a mountainous, storm-ridden region make a writer more able to write terrifically intense scenes with a lot of external tension? Does the flatland do the opposite, perhaps bringing out more internal risk in characters or narrator?Read more »"},
{"title": "What Works When Sharing Your Work?  Unexpected and Traditional Publicity Tips from Five Published Writers", "date": "Friday, June 2, 2023", "text": "Be sure to scroll down to the Shout Out! at the end of this post for some exciting news.I've been learning--somewhat to my private self's dismay--that reaching out to readers requires not only persistence but exposure. It's risky to share the author behind the book.Yet this week I interviewed five published writers--and former students of mine--who have gone on to reinvent their outreach and succeed beautifully in touching readers and building a worthwhile, supportive community in the process.What if you don't want to build community? Or have readers know you behind your book? I've heard this a lot from writers: \"You mean, after all the years of putting together a publishable book, I also have to welcome readers into my private life and be glad about it?\" It's certainly up to you. And in past times, that worked--the writer stayed in her cozy room and her book got whisked into the hands of readers without much effort. Or so it was true with my early books.Promotion when I began publishing in the eighties was also more about how you appeared than anyone getting to know you as a person. When one of my nonfiction books was published, the publisher hired a wonderful publicist who got me interviews on over 100 radio and television programs, and my goal was just to look and talk like an expert--or at least someone who knew what they were writing. Of course imposter syndrome flared--I ran the gamut, grateful when my book sold well, but all the time wary of being outed for my real life. I didn't want readers coming too close--I'm able to admit that now, looking back.Today's author needs to be more focused on building community with readers. Podcasts, \"in conversation with\" events, how we share on social media, all this is about getting to know the story behind the story. Readers want to relate to the person who wrote the book we so admire--or are curious to read.It means the writer becomes known, not just for her words but for herself.Read more »"},

{"title": "Bringing Authenticity into Your Writing: The Challenges and the Benefits of One Writer's Journey with His Memoir ", "date": "Friday, May 26, 2023", "text": "Many of us say we want to write with authenticity.  Of course, that's a worthy goal, as is living an authentic life. But it can also be a challenging one. In our lives, we can decide what to reveal or not reveal, and still live authentically within those perimeters, I believe. On the page of a book, it's different. You share a story from your life, from your heart and core values, and readers can take it anywhere they want.    I've been drafting short essays about my mom, who was a pilot in World War II.  Her story of being in the Women's Airforce Service Pilots program was recorded in a Library of Congress interview. She died several years ago at age 98. Reading about her flying years, now that she's gone, made me realize how little I knew of her life, as her daughter. We get to know our loved ones even more after they're gone, a bereaved friend once told me, and I'm seeing that now.  I have so many questions:  how did she get to be so strong, such a survivor? At twenty-two, she was ferrying B-24's across the US to Canada. Once, her plane engine caught on fire and she had to do a dead stick landing at LaGuardia.    One of my past students, Jody Lulich, was another example to me of surviving. I had the privilege of working with him both in classes and as a private client after he won the prestigious Loft Mentor Series in 2015 for his memoir-in-progress. Jody struggled to structure the story of growing up in a biracial family with a mother who committed suicide when he was a boy. Read more »"},

Turns out, this element of your story--its message, its meaning--is the way readers most engage with your work. Sure, an exciting plot is important. Great people to populate your book's stage.

Such is our life now, or so it is for many of us.If you're working on a book, as I've said often in these posts, you need ongoing support. It's very challenging to write, develop, and submit a book in isolation. It speeds and smooths the way if you have fellow book writers creating a community and lending their enthusiasm.  When I poll student in my online classes, at least half the group belongs to a writer's group or has a writing partner. Writing is solitary; it's easy to get a little nutso when you've been on your laptop, deep in your story, for hours without interacting with another human. I know this well! Even virtual interaction with someone else who gets it can ease your way back into your normal life.

{"title": "Pros and Cons of Present Tense versus Past", "date": "Friday, March 17, 2023", "text": "The question of writing in present tense versus past tense didn't even occur to me when I began writing and publishing back in the eighties. Or even when I started writing and publishing fiction in the late nineties. I never thought about writing in any tense but past. It was the norm. Only writers on the very edge, in my unschooled opinion, ventured into present tense.Present tense almost seemed impolite, if I can use that old-fashioned term. The writer, the writing, was pushing into the reader's face, demanding attention over the story itself. I personally thought using present tense for a novel or memoir, for instance, was like shouting the story rather than letting it speak for itself.That was then. Now, present tense is ordinary. Half the books I pick up use it. And as a reader, I can appreciate it; it doesn't feel wrong or awkward or too attention-getting to me anymore. Not at all.Read more »"},

A fellow writer commented decades ago that everyone knows everyone else at the agented-manuscript level. While this may not be totally true, the marketplace does operate on subjectivity--which comes down to who you know, and what their opinion is.Of course, there's business smarts too. An editor may love a manuscript but her sales team isn't convinced because of the numbers. But that editor's enthusiasm is still the first spark, the necessary one that starts the process. How does that editor get sparked? Usually, someone presents the book to her, the concept catches her attention, and she reads the manuscript.

Most of us have enough challenge with just one, right?But the question is a good one. There are indeed certain tips or techniques for those who are tempted to try two or more books using the same topic or characters. I wasn't going to be one of those, but the characters in my first novel wouldn't leave me in peace after it was published. One of them, the narrator's father, made it into a few short stories (notably the just-published \"Breathing Room\" which I mentioned last post). He was challenging and interesting to write, and I felt he had a lot more to say than just one novel, or as it turns out several short stories, allowed. The young narrator of Qualities of Light also intrigued me, and I was especially taken by her love interest. So I began to wonder: what might happen three or five years down the road with this family? How might they be same, different, tragic? That's usually what launches a writer into series land.Read more »"},

Sketching out scenes, writing pages, organizing your book structure, all the activities that are required to actually produce a book. Not enough will and nothing gets done. We've all been there!

Her recent issue was about the challenges and benefits of rest and fallow periods in the life of the writer. She spoke about the difficulty they bring for some of us--and I immediately related. I am a poor patient, not enjoying enforced rest when ill, while my spouse loves it--the reading, the naps, the staring at nothing. I want to be up, to be productive. That trait has its blessings--I rarely get stuck with my writing goals--but easy acceptance of fallow periods is not one of them.Sometimes life brings just what we need, not what we want. Post-Thanksgiving, I spent two weeks with covid. Nothing like some experience but still very unpleasant. Many days I could do nothing but stare. Our two dogs loved it--for once, I was motionless.

Some writers pay no attention to these. They mix the flow writing with the editing, and they have enough skill to produce a good book. They are he lucky ones. Most of us need to keep a map along for such an onerous journey as a book, and the stages help keep the traveler oriented to where they are in the process.One of the big tasks that comes along, often unwelcome, is asking What's the point? Writers ask this question at all stages but often it's unanswerable until revision. That's because we may not know yet. We may be writing blind, or according to an incomplete view of our book, which is completely normal and alright. It keeps us from getting too full of ourselves in the early stages.I've read some writing recently, both unpublished and published, that had me asking that question. For the unpublished writing, there's still time to figure out the point.Read more »"},

I'm best able to vision in stillness--and by that, I mean clearly see what I want from my writing and my life. A good friend once shared that she sees vision as a counterpart to will. Will being the energy to push forward, to move, to make decisions, to set oneself in the chair and do the writing that's on schedule for that day.Without vision, though, it's just typing on a page.And that, truly, can be fine. Sometimes vision doesn't come in early drafts. Two of my favorite writers, George Saunders and Ron Carlson, write eloquently and knowledgably about the non-visioning phase of putting words on the page, how essential it is, how often it gets very messed up when visioning is involved. We stop to consider what we are saying, and we're lost. The editor mind steps in, the sheer flow of words gets stuck in analyzing.But, equally, I find there's a place after the words are downloaded when the writer must step back and look at the vision. Really, that's what \"re-visioning\" is, right? The necessary act of seeing again. Of looking deeper.Read more »"},

James Pennebaker, from the University of Texas, Austin, launched my personal interest in this topic when I faced a life-threatening illness in the late nineties. Reading his and others' books on healing via writing clued me into the amazing medical documentation that's accumulated. A favorite book I've mentioned before on this blog is Louise De Salvo's Writing as a Way of Healing. De Salvo reviews the three aspects that actually make writing a healing experience. They are key.Before I learned about them, I thought just processing (on paper, with a friend, with a therapist) was enough. I've journaled for years and believe in its power.

{"title": "Writing the Unsympathetic Narrator--So What If Your Readers Don't Like Them?", "date": "Friday, September 23, 2022", "text": "Last week, I talked about false beliefs, how they create character change and growth. As a character in fiction or memoir faces the limitations of their beliefs about a situation, themselves, or the world, they often find a bigger view. That gives them the opportunity to change, to learn stuff, to become a more authentic person. Life is life, though. The opposite is also (sadly, often) true. We see the limits but we continue to embrace them. We may clasp even more tightly, fearing the unknown more than we detest our current situation. Character in fiction and memoir do this too, even more so. They become what's called unsympathetic.Many writing books and many writing teachers have advised me to lean towards the more sympathetic character--if I want readers to engage in the story. I've found this sometimes true. If a character is really awful, or very stuck, and it's hard to get behind them, readers can detach from the story.Read more »"},
{"title": "Your Narrator's False Belief--and How It Drives Your Story", "date": "Friday, September 16, 2022", "text": "Character in fiction and memoir is built on certain convoluted pathways. Because tension and conflict drive story, these pathways are often full of false beliefs or mistaken views of self and life that get examined as the story moves forward and the character grows. As readers, we witness the journey: the narrator's relative ignorance or unconsciousness at the start of the book, maybe creating a life fueled by fear or anger; the changes as they grow more aware, shedding their limited views; the downslide of the tragic character who embraces their mistaken beliefs even more. False belief makes a great structural model for story, both in memoir and fiction, and it's even applicable to nonfiction (the reader comes to your book with a limited view and uses your material to expand that view).Read more »"},

I found this book very useful for memoir as well--anything, actually, that attempts to tell a story along a certain timeline, moving backwards and even forwards, trying to keep the reader oriented.Some writers find that better shape and smoother flow via plot work.

For me, sound is an important player in creation of theme, voice, and pacing, especially during revision.I learned from one of my teachers way back in grad school to create a soundtrack for my book.

One is George Saunders who writes a Substack newsletter called Story Club. This week, Saunders answered a reader question about self-consciousness and the question \"Am I any good?\" In a brilliant response he gently guided the new writer through the self-education of two parts: the writer and the editor. If the question (Am I any good?) is asked during the writing part, it stops the process. It's an editor question, a question best asked and answered once the writing is at least roughly drafted. A reader of this (my) blog wrote in recently about my recommendation to let a manuscript rest for 1-2 weeks before the editing part dives in. The 1-2 weeks is my best-guess minimum. Some writers need more time, some less. The goal of this rest is to allow a clean transition between the writer who is typing words on a page and the editor who is asking, Is this any good? The two are not usually in sympathetic conversation. They need to operate in separate rooms, especially if writing books is new to you.Read more »"},

But I also find it takes some personal processing time, either on the page or otherwise, to gain the objectivity that makes an emotion universal.In my early writing days, I didn't understand this. I \"journaled\" my own emotions into my characters. Basically, this is told emotion--we tell ourselves the feelings and thoughts when we journal. Not a bad thing at all, very needed when we are trying to make sense of our lives. But these emotions are often one step removed from the reader--they are too personal to our lives.Read more »"},

{"title": "Query Letters That Actually Worked to Catch an Agent or Publisher", "date": "Tuesday, April 19, 2022", "text": "Query letters are a bear to write. So many writers who have finally published their novels, memoirs, or nonfiction books remember the agonizing process of learning how to write and refine this all-important document. It's the first thing an agent or editor (if you bypass an agent) will see of your work, so not only does it need to carry the flavor and tone of your writing, it needs to be catchy, snappy, and slick enough to stand out, while being heart-felt and authentic at the same time.Whew.I've personally worked harder, sometimes, on my query and synopsis than on many parts of my books. I've hired editors and coaches to just help me hone the query--that paid off, by the way--and I've given myself many months to work on it so the process didn't feel rushed. It does require a different part of the creative self than the manuscript, though, and I often found it tough to toggle between the deep immersion of writing and living in story and the marketing focus a query required.Read more »"},

IM is literally a monologue--a thought process, like dialogue except not spoken aloud. (If you missed that post, go to http://HowtoPlanWriteandDevelopaBook.blogspot.com).There are other ways to reveal internals in your story, though--not just IM. But we may not be aware, as writers, that they are already present. When I learned from one of my past students about a nifty tracking systems for internals, I wanted to try it out and share it here.Interiority or \"internals\" is a fancy way to describe the reader's view into your characters' inner lives. Some genres require a lot of this (memoir), some much less (thrillers). Internals are what makes a character real to the reader. Skilled writers reveal interiority in several ways. It's important to know what your genre requires and how to plant and build the interior lives, without having them slow the momentum of the story.Read more »"},

A practice we have permission for, with our other obligations, including family, friends, and work. That doesn't feel like we're stealing time from other, more important things.I personally believe this is why Nanowrimo, or National Novel Writers Month, is so popular. We make a commitment to write every single day, about 2000 words. We join virtually with thousands of other writers in a strange and creative global community. We give ourselves permission to do this for one month (or, if you join nanowrimo camp in summer, more often). We don't care how rough the writing is--we just show up and do it.Read more »"},

Take my current novel, located on an island I once visited and never forgot. I spent a half day online verifying facts about the geography and climate, so I could pepper the narrative with realistic details (not quite as delightful as another visit but necessary). A writing colleague is working on Civil-War historical fiction--tons of research about place, era, clothing, even speech is essential to create a believable setting.

{"title": "Imagine Actually Finishing Your Book--A Three-Part Visualization Exercise (That Works!)", "date": "Friday, July 16, 2021", "text": "Summer can be a distracting or deepening time for writers--depends how much you are pulled away by the plethora of activity and energy in warm weather. I've got gardening and travel and now puppies on my plate, so it's easy to forget my book entirely. I've learned to keep it in my attention with a great three-part exercise, using visualization.Visualizing your goals used to be a woo-woo exercise. Now sports teams and creative types use it a lot. A painter standing in front of a blank canvas might imagine the sketched-in composition. That's visualizing. A tennis pro imagines lobbing the ball to the perfect place in his opponent's court. Nothing weird about this, nothing at all.Many pro writers use this \"thinking from the end\" idea--novelist Roxanna Robinson mentioned how she writes to an image when she begins a book. Sue Monk Kidd used an image board to create The Secret Life of Bees. All forms of visualization. I use it in the hot months as a creative exercise. Right now, am thinking about the end of my current book. I'm imagining the corrections done and it actually being finished!This three-part creative visualization exercise can keep you brainstorming your book's completion, no matter where you are in the journey.Step 1: Grab some paper and a pen or your laptop. Set the kitchen timer for 20 minutes.  Write, without editing or censoring anything, about how you might feel when your book is finished. When it is published. Write your thoughts about how your life or sense of yourself as a writer might change. Write your fears and even terrors about others reading your work. Write any memories you have of other times when you've failed or succeeded in realizing a big goal.Let the writing go wherever it goes--even if it brings up dark thoughts and feelings, which it might, as well as excitement.  It's great to get it all out on paper where it can be seen for what is it.Step 2: Find a piece of 8-1/2 inch x 11 inch white paper that you can fold in half lengthwise to resemble a blank book cover.  You're going to make a prototype of your cover. I love this exercise's power to really bring home the image of the published book.You can do this with online images or pictures torn from magazines. If you decide to search online, a great free site is www.unsplash.com. You may know of others. If you decide to do it more tactilely, you'll need 4-5 magazines and a pair of scissors, some glue or tape, and a big sheet of paper.Set the kitchen timer for 30 minutes and scan the magazines or online site for the perfect image for the front of your book when it is published. Print the image or cut it out and paste it to the front of your book cover.  If you're savvy with Photoshop or another software, change and tweak as much as you want.Feel free to grab a copy of a published book you love and study its cover for ideas.Next, create your blurbs. Blurbs are the short testimonials on the back and front cover. In your wildest dreams, who do you want to write a blurb for your book? Which reviewers from The New York Times, Kirkus, Publishers Weekly might read your book and rave about it? Draft some stellar reviews for your book and paste them to the back cover or below your cover image.Want to do one more fun step? Some of my students go all out with this exercise, adding a bar code and back cover copy and even a spine. Get into it--it'll actually help you feel like you might someday finish!.Put the completed cover on the wall of your writing space or take a photo and use it as wallpaper on your computer or device. Step 3: Design your publication party.When books are published, someone (friends, relatives, book clubs, even the publisher sometimes) will throw you a publication party. When my first novel, Qualities of Light, was published, I had two parties! Lots of people came and I signed many copies of the book and read aloud from my favorite chapter. It was a blast.Imagine your pub party. What would you just love to have as part of it? Music, food, literary stars, speeches, thousands of books sold? Set your kitchen timer for 20 minutes and list all your wishes.Put these up where you can see them, too, in your writing room or on your desktop or phone. They are big boosts for days when you can't seem to find time or make any headway on your book this summer.And pay attention to how they charge up your writing in the next week. Maybe they'll work for you like they did for me.Read more »"},

Sometimes I skim over the visceral parts, but I always study the dialogue.Dialogue isn't usually the vehicle for momentum in story. Its purpose is to deliver undercurrent, reveal what's not being said. Often, dialogue will let us into the underworld of a character, showing whatever is hidden and secret. Not because this is stated in the dialogue itself, but because it's communicated by the tags (he said, she said) or lack thereof, by the pauses and beats, by the dialect or tone. In thrillers, the dialogue contributes to pace. The dialogue kicks things into gear.Read more »"},

He sleeps a lot, which is a blessing.But my writing life has been upended. Not to mention sleep. Not to mention every other aspect of my every day.We chatted with a woman this week who works with animals. She said some of her clients swear than raising a puppy is harder than raising a kid.

They discussed using present versus past tense when writing memoir. What were to pros and cons of each, what effect did they have on the reader?Interestingly, one group member had spoken to her editor about this. The editor strongly encouraged her to switch her present tense chapters to past tense. She was confused about the virtues of each.We're talking verb tense here.  Past tense of your verbs or present tense--and what's the difference. Just to review, here's how a sentence looks with the verbs in past tense:  John went to the game and arrived late.  If you use present tense for the same sentence, here's how it would read:  John goes to the game and arrives late.Read more »"},

I often printed hard copies and kept a file folder until the piece was published.

I'd been published for years in memoir and nonfiction, but fiction was truly another animal. I researched schools, found one, got accepted, and began. In those two years, I learned a lot I didn't know, but one particular piece of advice reshaped my understanding of chapters, scenes, and books.It was this: Enter late, leave early.I learned, after graduation, that this slogan is widely known among screenwriters. Less so among novelists or short story writers, although it's just as valuable to us. William Goldman and David Morell wrote it as \"jump in late, leave early.\" It applies to scenes, to chapters, to the entire book, in my mind. But I find it most useful in chapters.Read more »"},

They were a far cry from what I learned as I studied scene-making. Scenes are the backbone of a book, at least in the fiction and memoir genres.

{"title": "Dealing with Rejection Close to Home:  When Family and Friends React to Your Writing", "date": "Friday, February 19, 2021", "text": "A reader sent me a poignant email a few months ago. She's writing a memoir and happened to show segments to her family--for all the best reasons. She wanted her sister and brother to verify facts from their turbulent childhood. She wanted them to validate what she remembered. And she, naturally, wanted their support as she went forward with the book.It's a hard story to write, and support would be so very welcome. But instead of confirming her memories, this writer's siblings reacted strongly against them, horrified that she'd open the vault of family secrets. Another writer wrote me this week about her own family rejection--she'd put together a group of her stories and created Shutterfly books as holiday gifts. They were lovingly made, with photos tucked into the narrative. But she received only silence from most of the recipients, just one acknowledgement. That hurt!I've heard similar stories in my classes, experienced it myself. I was once married to an editor, like myself. When I showed him my novel-in-progress, he took great care to mark all the punctuation and other errors in his trademark red pen, then handed it back to me. I asked him what he thought of the story itself, since that's what I was really after. \"I don't read fiction,\" he told me. And I knew that. So why did I expect differently?I've come to believe there are two main reasons we decide to share writing with those closest to us. One reason is to get their feedback, blessing, or approval if we are including them in our stories in some way (even fictionalized or with identity mostly hidden). That's reasonable and often wise. A recently published memoirist worked with me on this very issue when she was writing about a mentally ill brother. She sought unofficial release from him, his permission, and he gave it. It relieved her immensely to know that at least she'd done her best to include him in the decision. Another writer I worked with carried a completely different view: her writing was nobody's business but her own, her story was hers to tell, she needed no approvals. You have to find your own side of this line.For me, I decided to get signed releases from those whose stories I included in my memoir/self-help book years ago, and I'm glad I did. A few years after publication, one of the contributors wanted his story removed. I approached the publisher but the book was not able to be reprinted on just this request alone--too costly. And I had the signed release. I went back to the contributor and shared the news. Not entirely what he wanted, of course, but nothing he could do about changing their decision. On the other hand, I didn't run family stories by my siblings before including them. Neither sib was mentioned in the story--only our grandmother--but it still caused friction for about a year after publication. All's well now, but that was a good lesson. I don't know if I'd have done anything differently, though. I leaned towards the \"this is my story\" when I made that decision, and I stand by it now. The other reason we share our writing with those closest to us is as a gift. Like my reader who made the Shutterfly books, we are giving something from our hearts to theirs. And writing, given as a gift, is precious indeed. We expect, even if we haven't said it even to ourselves, some reaction, some thank you, some praise. We want our beloveds to love it as we do.In my experience, this rarely happens. Sad to say. I am extremely choosy about who I share my writing with now. I learned from my ex (the editor mentioned above) that praise is not automatically granted even if we're married. I've also learned from sharing with close friends that they can be bewildered by my expectations and not really know how to react. Whether they love the writing itself or don't, it's a bit like someone painting a picture for another person and giving it with the expectation that it'll be appreciated. I also remember doing this with a dear friend, many years ago. Gifting her with one of my paintings, then never seeing it hanging in her house. Eventually I asked. She said it wasn't her taste. We remained friends but I learned a hard lesson there.My choosiness now, around sharing my writing, means I have a group of writerly friends and colleagues. I share with them. If I share writing with a friend, I make sure they know what I want from the gesture--I tell them directly what kind of feedback I'd like, if any. That helps them. I also tell them that if they'd prefer not to give feedback, to just let me know. A big relief for everyone. My spouse is a working singer-songwriter. We have discussed this topic so often, because it impacts both of us. When to share, with whom, and what to expect. Sometimes, one of us wants to share just because an exciting milestone has been reached--a gnarly lyric completed, a hard scene. We've given each other feedback for works-in-progress in the past, very usefully and with goodwill. Now, we tend to wait until something is show-ready. In fact, I haven't even shared a word of my current novel, wanting my agent to comment first.There's something good about waiting. I call it creative tension. In my early career, I had very little of it and shared with everyone. I'd find the energy or good tension around a project collapsing fast. I learned to wait, let the tension build, let it generate momentum. More got finished.There's no single right way, in my opinion. You find your own side of the line. But just one small piece of advice: be sure, before you share, why you're sharing and if the people, those dear to your heart, are the best receivers.Read more »"},

The worst one I've experienced is this: start with chapter 1 and go through the book, line by line. That is great for the final fine-tuning. But if you're trying to revise larger problems, such as structure, it'll bog you down in no time.

{"title": "Unspoken Agreements and How They Drive Characters in Fiction and Memoir", "date": "Friday, February 5, 2021", "text": "In real life, people operate under unspoken agreements that try to keep the status quo--whether that status quo is calm or the opposite. I'm enjoying a winter novel by Frederik Backman, author of A Man Called Ove, that brilliantly depicts a group of characters acting in an unspoken agreement to preserve a town that's rent by scandal. Although a young girl is raped, there's also a hockey final coming, and the star player is the perp. Everyone, except a very honorable few, chose to ignore what happened and keep the team forefront. Backman ratchets the tension higher and higher until everything breaks apart and people have to face the falsity and injustice square on. Unspoken agreements drive story. There's a real difference in how a character, or group of characters, \"presents\" to the world and how they really feel. The dichotomy is what creates that wonderful tension that keeps us reading.Read more »"},

When I was writing How to Master Change in Your Life, a spirituality/self-help hybrid, I remember working on a chapter about business failure and bankruptcy. Reliving that terrible time was so difficult, I actually had to run to the bathroom and throw up. Other times I'd get so stuck, I couldn't write one word.Two things were happening: I was processing what I hadn't finished. And, at the same time, I was trying to get enough of a perspective to tell the story for others.This double duty affected me on so many levels, I sought help. Talking about the events with others, especially a therapist, helped the processing part. I moved through shame and sadness, anger and fear, to gradual acceptance. I also got great help from resources like The Tapping Solution, my daily spiritual practice, and chanting.  These helped dispel some of the intensity and lift me above the constant mental chewing over what had happened (here's a short video on a chant that helped me the most--and I still use every day, especially now).

They don't understand its primary purpose:  to increase tension and emotion in a scene.I learned dialogue-writing many years ago, via a two-step method that serves me well today.

{"title": "Writing Strong Transitions:  Scene to Scene, Chapter to Chapter, How to Keep Your Reader Turning the Page", "date": "Friday, June 20, 2014", "text": "I learned about the importance of transitions during my MFA study.  One of my thesis advisers, a talented novelist, read my novel-in-progress and liked it but felt my background as a newspaper writer hampered my transitions.  \"You end each chapter like you would a journalistic piece,\" she told me.  \"It's complete, nothing left to push the reader forward into the next chapter.\"She was right.  As a syndicated newspaper columnist for twelve years, I was trained to keep my thoughts short, and wrap them up with a flourish.  The goal was reader satisfaction, a sense of completion.  Closure.\"Closure is the last thing you want in the middle of a book,\" my adviser said.  \"You want to keep your readers turning the page.\" Most  writers in revision--and some in early-draft stage--come to a point  where they begin to look at transitions.  Transitions are the small but  essential bridges that lead your reader from the end of one scene, one  thought, one idea to the next.  Whether within a chapter or between  chapters, unless transitions are solid, the reader will choose that  moment to set down your book.  And maybe never pick it up again.Transitions of Chronology These are the simplest and easiest to write--but not always useful unless you stay in strict time sequence in your scenes.  Chronological transitions are phrases like these, placed in the next scene or chapter to indicate the passage of time, change of location, or change of point of view:  \"By the next morning, he . . .\" or \"Two days later . . . \" or  \"It had only been three weeks since she'd last . . . \"Chronological transitions can feel clunky to the reader after a while.  They are like reading a chart of time passing, unless done well.  I use these, but sparingly.  More often, I play with word and image transitions.Word and Image TransitionsA simple way to transition is to repeat an image or word.  In The Hours, Michael Cunningham's Pulitzer-winning novel that tracks the lives of three separate women, he uses the image of yellow roses.  In one scene, yellow roses are being arranged in a vase for a party; in another, they are being piped on the top of a birthday cake.  The reader doesn't consciously go, \"Oh, yeah, yellow roses again,\" but the image is registered and a sense of smoothness results.  We note it subconsciously and read on because the tiny bridge is there, making our transition easier.Whenever I move within a chapter to backstory, or a memory, I will craft a transition.  Possibly I'll repeat an image, like the yellow roses.  One scene might have oranges on the table in a bowl, and the character or narrator as a child is staring at the strange light playing across them.  The next scene might have someone juicing those oranges the next morning.  Senses are another excellent way to transition.  Say you are writing a book set in a doctors' offices.  What is common to these?  The paper on the exam table (repeat the feel of it under the skin, the crackle as you slide).  The antiseptic smell.  The well-used copies of Outside or People magazine that feel so worn as you turn the pages.  The cold air.You would choose one of these and see if you can repeat it.  Use it in one scene, then again in a slightly different way in the next, to create the transition.  Smells and sounds are particularly strong transitions in a reader's subconscious.Dialogue or Gesture TransitionsYou can also use repeated dialogue or gestures.  Lighting a cigarette, coughing, picking at a torn cuticle, or a certain phrase repeated--these are embedded as transition in so many books!  We readers, again, don't necessarily notice them, but don't think they are placed by accident.  Skilled writers work hard at this.Object of Obsession TransitionsIf a certain object--in my last novel, Qualities of Light, a stolen jackknife--becomes the object of obsession in your book, carry it through as a transition tool.  Repeat mention of, or a sensory note about, this object as you move between chapters and from present time to backstory.  The reader will feel the smoothness of this repetition back and forth through time.Beware of using the same language each time, though.  Brainstorm ten ways to describe aspects of this object, for instance.  Jackknife had \"sharpness,\" \"cutting edge,\" \"shiny steel,\" and other descriptors.  I didn't always say the word jackknife, but when I used these knife-like images, it created the transition.Transitions, when first created, may have a mechanical feel.  As if you are manipulating the language and it will be obvious to readers.  This is where feedback comes in handy.  I felt my transitions were awkward and obvious when I first wrote them in, but my editors loved them.  Your Weekly Writing Exercise1.  Make a list:  read the current ending of each chapter and the beginning of the next, and note key images, words, objects, gestures, or dialogue you have in place that could serve as a transition.2.  Do any transitions already exist--aside from time chronology?  How can you strengthen them?3.  Where are transitions completely missing between your chapters?  How can you add them in?  Once you have crafted strong transitions for the chapters, begin work within the chapters.  Each scene within a chapter (\"islands\" of writing) requires a good transition to keep your reader engaged."},
{"title": "Pros and Cons of Feedback on Your Writing:  Finding Out What You REALLY Need (and Getting It) ", "date": "Friday, June 13, 2014", "text": "I teach all levels of writers, and I especially love working with brand-new writers.  Someone who has just gotten an idea for a novel.  Or a parent who has been meaning to write a nonfiction book about their special needs child and what this writer learned while navigating a difficult school system.  Or a beginning memoirist who is still reeling from childhood but driven to get the stories on paper.They all want me to tell them how to write, but in the same breath they say, \"And be sure to tell me what's not working.  Don't hold back.\"This approach is a mark of new writers, I've learned.  Most experienced writers learn what makes them keep writing--and it isn't always critique.  But a new writer is still high on the energy of the idea.  They can't imagine the long haul ahead.  They think writing is easy.One stand-out memory from a past class was such a new writer.  He was in one of the online classes I took before I began teaching.  When he introduced himself to the group, he said he was new but used to criticism.  He told us, \"Give me all the critique you have!\"   In other words,  don't just give constructive feedback but also what was totally wrong, what really sucked (his words) in our humble opinions.   I watched, not really knowing yet about this phenomenon.  The group took him at his word.  They told him how much he still had to learn.The writer lasted about 2 weeks  before he stopped writing altogether.  He dropped the class, I think.  I wasn't surprised.   I was surprised that the teacher didn't step in, but maybe she felt it was good to weed out the weak early?  It's not my way, as an instructor.I learned a lot from watching this feedback process.  It reinforced my approach, which is based on the stages of a writer's growth, finding the best level of feedback for where you are, so you keep writing.     Stages of a Writer's Growth--and Feedback NeedsIn  the early years of our writing journey, we need mostly constructive  feedback.  We need what will help us thrive, figure out our unique voice, explore story ideas without too much negative self-talk or external critique.  Our own critical voice is usually strong as we struggle through our learning curves.   Best now to hear what's working.  Also, what  can be improved, but via suggestions and questions given in a constructive way.  In my classes, I ask questions that open doors for the writer.  Each time I read one of my student's pieces, I see (always!) things that  are strong.  Things that are unique to that writer's experience, perspective, voice, and style.  I point them out.  Knowing what works, will help the writer at this stage.   Then I look for areas where I want more, as a reader.  Where I felt things were missing.   I want to know more about the  setting, for instance, where this event is occurring.  What the narrator is actually doing physically in the scene as they reflect on their past or future challenge.  That's called the outer story (the outer details of what is happening) and grounds me, as a reader, in the  inner story (the thinking or feeling).  So I might ask about this.   Or I  might ask to read more about the sensory details--what the character or  narrator is smelling or hearing at that moment.  These elements bring  out the inner story too and make the scene more intense for me as a reader.  That's a good thing.  Two steps to giving feedback:  (1) look at inner and outer story, and ask myself what could be developed more.  Then (2) ask a question or two about  that missing area.   Questions ignite ideas in the  writer's mind and bring more good stuff to the page.No use, truthfully, in saying to someone:  \"This really didn't work for  me.\"  What does this do for the writer?  Mostly,  they begin to question if they should be writing at all.  Maybe they are  stupid and (on and on) . . . The Inner Critic has a field day.   The  writer slinks off and becomes what we call in online classes a \"lurker,\"  if they even continue writing.  No way they will share their writing  again.We're  trained in school to get criticized more than we get encouraged.  I  was, at least.  When I was at revision stage in my MFA, I got a lot of critique and at that advanced level, I needed it.  But when I was beginning each of my books, I  mostly needed to hear what was good, strong, and working.  Constructive feedback kept me going and opened the creative door wider and  wider into new ideas.Everyone's  writing has strong areas and weak areas.  My teaching style is to first  build up the strong areas until they are solid enough to stand on, so  that when you do face your weak areas, your whole foundation won't  collapse.   What are you getting as a writer, right now, in terms of feedback?  Is it appropriate to where you are in your book journey?  How might you get more of what you really need?"},
{"title": "Raise the Emotional Stakes:  Strengthening Alchemy between Setting, Character, and Conflict", "date": "Friday, June 6, 2014", "text": "Morning: writing at my sunny desk.  Task:  revise a stubborn scene.  Advice from recent feedback:  bring more emotion into it.Sunshine and spring in New England today is no help.   In my fictional scene, it's chilly October in the northern mountains of New York state.  I'm sitting comfortably in my chair, laptop in front of me, spicy tea and good music and sweet air at hand.  My character, in her scene, has just crashed her small plane--on purpose.  She's bleeding, shaken, and starving.So our situations couldn't be more disparate.  How do I have the gall to attempt such writing--to capture the desperation of this person who only exists in my imagination?Because I know such desperation.  I've never crashed a plane, but I know well the survival instinct that my character rides on in this moment of the story.  To access my own memory of this, I use the writing techniques of alchemy.Alchemy simply means a combination of elements to create something magical.  In writing, these are three:  setting, action, and the character's physical state.  Combined in certain ways, they manufacture magic for the reader.  That magic that all good literature offers--where we readers can lose ourselves for a few hours in a different world.  The Alchemy of PlacePlace details are either wholly ignored by most writers--\"too slow for me,\" one of my students once said--or used too much.  Some writers dump a lot of setting details in the beginning of each chapter, the start of each scene, as if \"setting the stage.\"  Setting must be placed where the alchemy actually occurs.Use of the senses is the first element to successful settings.  Especially smell and sound.  These access the reader's own memories of place, make your job almost effortless.  In my online class, Strange Alchemy, we begin by studying famous writers' work--how do they place the sense of place in each section of a story, chapter, scene?  George Saunders, Judy Blundell, Flannery O'Connor, and many more teachers help us learn that placement is everything!  When we give feedback each week on excerpts from writing by fellow students in the class, our eye is already tuned to whether the placement is strong.Place is the backdrop used by professional writers to depict emotion.  Whatever the character notices--or doesn't notice--tells the reader about their emotional stage:  their distractions, their memories, their angst.  It's too good a tool to ignore.The Alchemy of a Character's Physical StateNext is the character's external self--not what they are thinking or feeling, which could be unreliable, but how they present themselves in the world, consciously or unconsciously.  A twitch, a certain favorite piece of clothing, a way of moving their hands, an itchy ear, all reveal emotion.  As with place, it's good to have enough but not too much.  In Judy Blundell's award-winning young-adult novel, What I Saw and How I Lied, she introduces the two main characters in the first page via certain physical details that completely show their future trajectories in the book:  the mother who smokes in the dark and whose lipstick-covered lips catch on the cigarette paper with every drag--a tiny but revealing sound heard by her not-sleeping daughter; the young girl who carries Baby Ruths in her bike basket to the foggy beach each morning to eat breakfast alone there.    I make a list this morning of my downed pilot's physical state--what is she wearing, what is moving or held still in her body as she waits, what aches and itches, what she does with her hands.  Combined with place, these physical elements of character create the first step of alchemy.The Alchemy of ActionPlace and physical attributes are only useful, though, if they are juxtaposed with action.  Dennis Lahane, author of Mystic River and other works, talked about this in an interview I read many years ago:  If a character is in the same room for more than one page, get them out of there.   Stillness is a pause, a valuable pause, but it doesn't move the writing forward.So instead of my downed pilot being able to sit and starve silently, reflecting on the wilderness around her, she must be doing something within a page.  Action is the final element of alchemy.  It's only by seeing a person in action that we really know them.  Put together, these three create magic.  When I begin a scene, I often will work on each element separately, to make sure I've covered it, then combine them in paragraph or chapter in good proportion to each other.  Action usually takes the most space, then the physical state of the character, then the setting.  Each is crucial to alchemy, but they work in a hierarchy.  Intrigued?  Consider studying the attributes of alchemy with me this summer in my online class which begins on Monday, June 9.  We spend four weeks on action (specifically, raising the stakes in your writing), four on character development, and four on place/setting.  Each week includes short readings in memoir and fiction by well-known writers, to study and learn from, as well as some very helpful writing exercises I've developed from my own work.  To learn more or register, click here."},
{"title": "Emotional Gateways--How They Help You Write and Revise Your Book ", "date": "Friday, May 30, 2014", "text": "On June 2, next Monday, I begin teaching my summer online classes.  In both the beginning and intermediate level classes, we examine how scenes, chapters, and whole books are built to deliver the exact meaning the writer wants.  Katherine Dering, a writer in past classes, just had her first memoir published.  She wrote me this week:  Your classes were very  helpful to me finishing and getting Shot in the Head, a Sister's Memoir, a Brother's Struggle published:  where to start, what to  cut or add, finding central images, rising and falling tensions, inner  and outer story, inviting the reader into the room...it all helped.   People tell me they couldn't put it down.  Mary, you must have gotten  through to me.Not an easy process.  But intensely rewarding when your book is finished and published, as Katherine now knows.  Those readers who can't put her book down are engaged because of the story's drama, of course, but also because of the emotional gateways this writer has crafted so expertly.    What Are Emotional Gateways?Most good books offer a series of gateways where the reader's own past, thoughts and feelings, memories and values, can connect with the story on the page.  Imagine them like entrances into the secret world of the book.  Emotional gateways are responsible for that blissful experience of getting lost in a story, thinking about it for days afterward, feeling rage or sorrow or joy as you read about someone you'll never meet but whose world is entirely real to you.Emotional gateways are openings into a book's meaning.  They are more powerful that intellectual delivery of ideas and concepts; they hook into more primal centers in the brain.  They depend on images and senses.  There is no effort to retrieve the memory, unlike the work it can take intellectually. Crafting strong emotional gateways is a skill every writer can learn, and I'm fierce about its importance in creating strong writing.  In my classes, we work on first expanding use of the five senses.  Involuntary memory evokers, the senses are the simplest way to open emotional gateways for readers.  (Remember Marcel Proust and his rhapsody on the tiny French cake called a madeleine in Remembrance of Things Past?) After expanding use of the senses, what's next?  Practice relaxing the linear side of the brain and engaging the image-based mind.  I use many exercises in my online classes to help writers learn this.  I offer the excellent resources of Robert Olen Butler's From Where You Dream (see below for blog post on this book) and Robert Boswell's The Half-Known World--two writing books that clear the way to image-work.  I also recommend daily freewrites based on images and collage work (Sue Monk Kidd, author of The Secret Life of Bees, and many other writers use cut-out pictures to prompt the image brain).  Most vital:  train yourself to not censor the images that come onto the page, even if you have no clue how they connect to your chapter or scene.A writer from Canada emailed me recently.  She asked how I approached my own writing after learning about emotional gateways.  What changed?  Everything.  I still write and revise with my lists, my charts, my character timelines and other linear tools.  But I give equal time to image work.  When my writing feels stalled out, I freewrite--just for 20 minutes--on a random image.  I know that \"stalled out\" feeling is just the linear brain becoming too active, critical, and disengaged from emotional gateway work.  Truthfully, for most of us, it takes re-awakening the part of ourselves that is so little used in daily life.  Once we do, it makes a tremendous difference in our writing.   For more information on my online book-structuring classes, where you can learn and practice emotional gateways, click here."},

{"title": "Resources for Writing a Potent \"Inner Story\" in Your Book", "date": "Friday, May 16, 2014", "text": "{This post also appeared earlier this week as a guest blog on Grub Street Daily.}Vivian Gornick talks about “the situation and the story”—the two elements of good prose.  What happens and why it happens.  Because of her simplicity in describing this complex idea, The Situation and the Story became one of the first truly influential writing books in my life.  Carol Bly’s The Passionate, Accurate Writer came next, teaching me about writing of consequence and how to stay unembittered while working with difficult material.  Finally, I found Kenneth Atchity’s innovative A Writer’s Time, which transformed the last five manuscripts I completed and published. For years, I wholeheartedly recommended these three books to my writing buddies, coaching clients, and students.  I know there are many very good writing books available—and shelves of them line my office—but only a few, such as these, have really taught me how to grow as a writer. A friend’s discovery recently added another transformative writing book to my small collection.  From Where You Dream, by Robert Olen Butler (Grove/Atlantic, Inc., 2005), is a series of lectures to his graduate fiction students, transcribed and edited by Janet Burroway (of Writing Fiction fame).  Although geared toward fiction writers, From Where You Dream answered my question on how to bring out the deeper meaning of any piece of writing, especially when writing a book. I teach online classes and workshops on how to structure your book in any genre.  In the workshops, writers learn about and explore the two levels of story that Gornick describes:  (1) the situation presented in outer events (“outer story”) and (2) the real story, or the inner changes that come from these events (“inner story”).  For most, a successful outer story is the easiest to write; it does not require opening a vein, being as vulnerable on the page, staying at risk. A successful inner story requires all of this.  It asks the writer to be present, vulnerable, delve into her own life for emotional truth, and bring it all back to her book.(By the way, “inner story” also applies to any small anecdote illustrating change or growth or new understanding in essays, informational books, travel books, and biographies.) Butler gave me good clues to writing inner story.  He proposes that to write successful emotional moments, a writer must dwell in the sensory elements of that moment.  It requires a full immersion into the senses. I tried this idea first on my own work and then in my workshops.  I worked for weeks with the techniques in Butler’s From Where You Dream.  Slowly, I discovered what Butler was suggesting:  that by fully dwelling in a sensory moment, space is created that the reader can enter.  Emotion emerges, almost organically. Most writers believe the reader needs some interpretation (the “telling” that often precedes “showing”) but Butler warms against this.  He counsels the writer to just stay in the sensory moment—a very difficult task, especially in early drafts of a book.  The rational mind loves interpretation.  We want to make meaning of everything.  Few readers need that in their literature—it actually can be an irritant.  Readers want to be drawn into the “dream” of the experience, as John Gardner wrote about.  Interpretation may be needed later, once the emotion is transmitted, but rarely is it needed early on.  An inner story (meaning) must evolve organically to be believed. Most valuable to me were Butler’s five main ways to transmit emotion to the reader.  I used these within the sensory experience, each became true gateways for my book’s inner story.  I began using them whenever I wanted to enhance a chapter, a scene, whenever I came across a moment in my story that needed enlivening. I recommend adding From Where You Dream to your writerly reading list this spring.  And try this simple exercise whenever you want to enliven your own inner story. You’ll be describing an event during your childhood, one that evoked strong emotion.  Write about this event, using the sense of sound as much as possible.  Your writing may encompass the other senses, but really focus on how things sounded, as much as you can recall. Add the sense of smell.  Continue writing about the event, keeping the emphasis on these two senses.  The writing may feel artificial or forced, but don’t let that critic stop you.  Try not to interpret, just create as strong a sensory experience as possible.Now ask yourself, How is my body feeling as I write this?  Close your eyes and perceive your breathing, heart rate, tightness of muscles, any fatigue.  Do you feel irritated, bored with your writing, sad, angry?  Write about your inner state and your physical sensations—add this information to the writing you’re doing, as you remember this past event.Next ask yourself, What don’t I remember hearing during this event I am writing about?  Asking yourself this question often brings back memories you may have forgotten—or wanted to forget. Then ask yourself, What was I afraid of smelling during this event I am writing about?Finish the exercise by writing how you feel now, looking back on this event. What has changed in your perception?     This exercise often brings out a theme, emotional resonance, or inner story that can be used in your book writing.      And if you'd like to explore your book's inner story (and outer story) further, join me in Boston on Saturday, May 31, 10:00 a.m. – 5:00 p.m. at Grub Street.  This class often sells out, so click on the link above (Grub Street school) to find out more or register."},
{"title": "How to Keep Your Writing in Your Over-the-Top Busy Life:  Helpful Techniques from the Experts", "date": "Friday, May 9, 2014", "text": "A particular exchange exists between the writer and her writing.  One feeds the other.  If you write, you write more.  If you stop writing, it's intensely difficult to get started again.Not only that, your sense of your writing's quality and potential changes.  After three days, some experts say, you essentially need to start over--the flow is gone and it's necessary to completely reacquaint yourself with the project and your vision for it.  Any momentum dies.  Regaining it can be hard work.  That's why many writers, once they stop writing, lose the rhythm of their practice.  The Inner Critic steps up to the plate:  The writing begins to look much worse than it actually is.  I believe the IC protects us from creative risks, and writing a book is certainly that.  Sometimes, to add more fun to the mix, a crisis appears just at that very moment that drains all creative energy.  Days go by, then weeks, then months.  The writing languishes.It's still there, of course.  But our attitude and guilt make it hard to approach again.  I've witnessed it countless times in my classes as well as with my own books.We miss it.  Writing brings something to our life that nothing else can.  So we begin to ask--very quietly, or loud and desperate:  What can I change?  What can I get rid of?  What new habits can I start, to keep writing in my over-the-top busy life?It doesn't take much, but it does take something.  I love the jumpstart techniques below.  They all work; they're all simple.  Which might work for you?  Elizabeth Gilbert's Timer TechniqueGilbert is the well-known author of many books, most notably her memoir Eat, Pray, Love.  She wrote a wonderful Facebook post last week about using a kitchen timer to get writing.  I love the timer technique.  I bought four of them to keep my wayward attention on track (when I am writing, I forget everything else; when I am not writing, I often need a timer to prompt me to get started).  To read Gilbert's suggestions, go to www.facebook.com and search for Elizabeth Gilbert (scroll down; the relevant post is the one with the kitchen timer illustration).Anne Lamott's Picture-Frame TechniqueLong ago I bought a 2-inch square empty photo frame for my desk.  Lamott, author of the wonderful writing book, Bird by Bird, suggests it as a jumpstart for writing sessions.  She tells herself (and now I do too) that she only has to write enough words to fit in the frame.  It comes to about 25 words, I've learned.Once you get over the 25-word hump, it's often easier to keep writing--and enjoy the flow again.Eric Maisel's First-Thing-in-the-Morning TechniqueMy writing buddy Nancy McMillan recently attended a writing workshop at Kripalu with creativity expert Eric Maisel.  Maisel is known for his books on the creative process, including Fearless Creating.  Nancy brought back an effective and simple idea from Maisel:  Give time to your writing first thing each day, before anything else.  Even 20 minutes, captured before the day's pressures begin, allows you to keep writing.Nancy's blog post is full of great ideas from the workshop.  Check it out here.Jerry Seinfeld's Calendar TechniqueSeinfeld used a big wall calendar to keep writing--he marked off each writing day with a red X and was loathe to break the chain.  It works for me too.  Read more about it here.My Take-a-Class TechniqueExhausted from family crises these past months, as well as an intense teaching schedule, I had a hard time making room for my writing.  The thing that did it:  taking a class.  I signed up for two short online courses, which required writing each day, and I found myself engaged again.The support of other writers, the joy of learning new skills, and the encouragement to show up and share all provide the accountability I personally need as a writer to keep going.  Many of my students say the same thing.What keeps you writing?  Which of these techniques--or other ideas--get you to the page each day or several times a week?"},

{"title": "Finding the Edges:  The Art of Theme and Voice in Fiction and Memoir", "date": "Friday, April 25, 2014", "text": "Novelists and memoir writers know the agony and ecstasy of voice and theme.  Two make-or-break aspects of a book, they arrive last-minute, often at final revision.  Neither can be planned or manipulated by the author.  Most successful thematic writers, when asked, come up clueless about how their work finds its voice and theme.Most writing teachers say theme and voice are impossible to teach.  The art of them (for it is more art than craft, with these two) must be caught.      I agree--and disagree.  As a writing teacher since the early eighties, I've practiced techniques to bring out meaning (theme) and allow natural strengths and uniqueness (voice) to emerge on the page.  Techniques train the creative self to sink into receptive, listening mode.  Techniques can alert you to what makes good meaning, how to ask for insight from others who may see it more clearly, and how to make room in your writing process to listen.  Voice is what comes as you become more of yourself on the page, reveal more, embrace vulnerability.  Both are all about letting go rather than pushing ahead.  What allows you to let go the easiest?  And still keep writing . . . When I was asked to teach a one-day workshop on \"The Art of Voice and Theme in Fiction and Memoir\" for the Loft Literary Center in Minneapolis this summer, I began researching more fervently--how do other writers do this?  My workshop will be on Saturday, July 19 (click here for more information), and I have some time to develop it.  But as luck would have it, insights began coming across my desk.Finding theme, or meaning, means limiting focus.  It sounds contradictory, but once you figure out what your book is about--which may connect with a place, an era, a relationship, or an event--you have something to write against.  As you write against this edge, you learn what is and what is not your story.  This seems, in my experience, to be the great doorway to theme and voice.It feels counter-intuitive, yes.  We imagine that theme is about stretching wide and opening up, that more meaning comes from letting in greater ideas.  There is an aspect of expansion in theme development, but it's when we figure out what the story is really about, that theme begins to emerge.Theme is meaning.  One of the exercises I give to my advanced online book-structuring classes is to write about what their book means to them.  What does it really mean to you, the writer?  Then write about the possible take-away for the reader.  Somewhere between these, theme or meaning often lies.A great insight came from reading Dani Shapiro's new book, Still Writing.  Dani has a chapter called \"Edges,\" where she cites a writer named Joshua Cody, author of the memoir, Sic.  Cody says, \"the key to any composition, it occurs to me, is to write against an edge, a frame.\"  Cody is a cancer patient, and for him, cancer is the frame he works with.  \"Put a frame around something, anything--the frame of cancer, say, around a life, and you've already gotten somewhere without willing it.\"  Shapiro adds, \"writing against an edge . . . can be enormously helpful in giving you clarity about your particular corner of the crazy-quilt.  Your patch of land.  Your precise and unique bit of geography.  Your world.\"  Your Weekly Writing Exercise1.  Ask yourself about the edges or frame of your book-in-progress.  Is your frame, or edge, nature or the wilderness, a certain relationship, coming of age or childhood, mental illness, cancer, disfigurement, rape or abuse, a serious illness such as AIDS or MS, the workings of tall clocks, sailing, a thru-hike?  What's the frame \"through which you can see you story\" and what edges or boundaries does it provide? 2.  Freewrite about this frame.  Decide, if you find more than one edge or frame, which is the most vital to you, to your story, if you had to choose just one."},
{"title": "Organizing Your Book:  Great Tips on What to Save, How to File It to Find It, and More!", "date": "Friday, April 18, 2014", "text": "Sharon, a blog reader, emailed me last week with a question about her book--not a writing craft question, but the all important organization SOS all book writers hit:\"Help!\" she wrote,  \"I'm swimming in paper and computer files.  How do I organize this mess, know what to keep and what to toss, and navigate the rest?\"In my book-structuring classes, we mostly deal with the art and craft of writing, but this question always comes up.  Writing a book is a long-term relationship between a writer and a lot of words.  It's not like one piece of paper, or even one notebook.  More like a marriage than a one-night fling.  It pays to be prepared for the onslaught.I use a couple of tried-and-true techniques for keeping track of my book as it moves from idea to chapters to first draft to multiple revision.  I've also gathered good tips from other published writers.  Here's the ten top tips--in no particular order of importance.  Maybe one or two will help Sharon--and you--keep afloat.   1.  Work with both a writer's notebook (for ideas, jottings, images, and freewrites) as well as a computer.  Some writers I interviewed used the computer for initial ideas, but many used a notebook.  The notebook kept them from over-editing in the early stages.  Tips:  Number and date your notebooks.  Plan time to transfer longhand writing into the computer (one writer started each writing session with 10-15 minutes of this; she said it got her motor going).  2.  In early drafts especially, work with a software that helps keep track of versions.  Scrivener was hands-down the favorite recommendation.  It's cheap ($45) and very intuitive.  You can create chapters-to-be as placeholders with ideas listed on the sidebar memo, play with character and place images to inspire you, add research in a split screen, rearrange your chapters' order in a click, and so much more.  Buying Scrivener was the best organization decision I ever made.3.  Work in islands, not outlines.  I teach the \"island\" method of developing a book, promoted by writer and teacher Ken Atchity.  Basically, you keep a list of possible scene or section topics in your notebook, update it every writing session with a few more ideas, and choose one at random to write about that day.  Write anywhere in the book.  Great for the right brain, as well as the linear left.4.  Organize your islands by key words.  Title each island or scene or section and save it in Scrivener or Word.  \"Clare--New York museum\"  \"Big flood\" \"Jonathan--Finding the gold necklace\"  Key words help you search and locate the scene as your manuscript grows--and helps you avoid duplicating.Regularly print a list of your islands, a directory of your file folders, or the binder contents in Scrivener, so you can keep track of what you have.  5.  Use an image board.  Sue Monk Kidd began The Secret Life of Bees with a single image that grew to a board full.  I start an image board when I begin a new book.  Take an hour and from 2-3 magazines, tear images that appeal to you--no need to wonder why.  Arrange and glue them onto a poster or foamcore board and hang in your writing space.  Use an image each time you need a freewrite prompt--write about what it means to you.  You may find these inform your story much more than you could imagine!6.  Start a dictionary of words you use a lot.  Even if you have a manuscript in process, start one now.  Do a global search to find your favorites.  Mine are deep, twisted, and sparkling--and I use them way too often, as I discovered when my dictionary began to build.  Vary your prose.7.  I know I'm going against the digital revolution when I suggest this:  Print each complete (bad to great) draft and put it into a binder.  Label the binders.  Store them where you can find them.  Most editors know that it's impossible to really see a manuscript only on the computer screen.  Hard copy rocks.  Print single-spaced, narrow margins, on scrap paper--most writers have tons of that--to save paper.    When your book is published, get rid of them.8.  Use different colored file folders for:  (1) unused chapter ideas, (2) research notes and photocopies of research sources, (3) blog posts--if your book is based on your blog, as many are, (4) feedback and critiques.9.  Keep a log of submissions and rejections.  An experienced writing buddy helped me create my first log when I began submitting short stories many years ago.  Simple, it had five columns:  title of piece, date sent, sent to (editor's contact info), sent via (email or snail mail) and answer received.  At first, this was all I needed.  When I began publishing, I added a sixth column:  date of publication.  And eventually a seventh:  payment received.10.  Many writers use Evernote to gather info from the web, store ideas, and cut down on paper.  I love it too, but I still need to physically handle my notes, see my handwriting or typing, read off screen.  But do check out Evernote if you haven't heard of it--very worthwhile."},
{"title": "Writing about Tough Topics:  When It Gets Personal in Your Story, How Do You Keep Going?", "date": "Friday, April 11, 2014", "text": "Michael, a writer from the New England area, took my workshop on book-structuring techniques last year.  He recently emailed me about his memoir-in-progress and asked a very good question.  Did I have any tips on writing about very serious topics?  Such as abuse, combat, or any subject that makes the writer go back to memories of past pain and trauma.Memoir writers face this question head-on.  But novelists may also draw from real-life experiences, processed into fictional scenes as they draft their manuscript:  one student in my classes is writing about a drowning in her novel that pulls memories and senses from her brother's death at a young age.  Another has crafted an excellent main character based on her mother's difficult life.What about nonfiction writers?  Because nonfiction now includes stories--most nonfiction books today are humanized by illustrations of the theories and methods--most deal with this question as well.  If the body is somatic, translating emotion into cellular experiences, we will process trauma as we write.  Writing about a business bankruptcy during the 1980s recession made me literally ill.  But the writing was wonderful catharsis, bringing deep healing, as well as being an unexpected gift to readers who felt shame at their own financial failures.Nevertheless, it can be tough going.  A sincere writer like Michael, who wants to bring both light and dark into his or her work, must deal with this tangle of emotions and memories.  But how?Writing Two Kinds of TruthAs we write, two kinds of truth emerge.  Each will have a different effect on our psyche.  Each of us may tend to include or ignore one of these kinds of truth whenever trauma is connected with it.As a newspaper writer for years, I was comfortable with factual truth.  The who, what, when, where of any situation seemed easy to write.  Emotional truth, or the meaning behind the facts, was harder.  Luckily, journalists weren't required to go there.  But when I began writing books, this \"inner story\" formed a base for the facts, and I had to learn to include it.  Memory will contain both, but we may not access both.  And we wonder what's really truth, perhaps, since memory of facts vary from person to person, as does emotional take-away. We may recall the facts of a situation and block the emotional meaning for many years; or the reverse.  It really depends on our wiring.  And how much processing is needed.  A great discussion of this duality is in Patricia Hampl's I Could Tell You Stories, one of my favorite books on the process of writing memories, whether true or fictionalized.  For me, the emotional effect of my business failure, the shame and fear and anger of it, was very easy to recall.  The facts were harder.  Others may write baldly about the loss of a parent, but take months or longer to get to the meaning, how this loss changed them.  Which are you?  Inner story writers are comfortable processing the feelings and inner workings of a trauma; they may have gone through years of therapy and forgiven those who harmed them, or themselves if they caused harm.  Their writing will often emerge more ethereal or conceptual.  Talking \"about\" the past experience, and its effects now, is easier than actually describing what happened.  Readers may not track the details of the event with this kind of writing.    Outer story writers have good reporter skills:  they know the facts.  They write dramatically, almost like a news report, but while readers can follow the specifics, they often note a feeling of emotional distance, as if the writer is not present in the room.   Merging the Two StoriesAn effective next step is to merge the two stories, the two kinds of truth, to provide both healing for the writer and a full experience for the reader.  But how exactly is this done?We're fortunate that writing as a healing element has been studied for decades.  Researchers on the therapeutic effect of writing include James Pennebaker, author of Writing to Heal and many other books, and Louise DeSalvo, author of Writing as a Way of Healing.DeSalvo states that three elements, when included in the process of writing about trauma, create a kind of alchemy that transforms both writer and reader:1.  the outer facts--including sensory details--of what happened2.  how you felt or thought about it when it happened3.  how you feel or think about it now, and what difference you notice in yourselfIn classes, I've taught these three elements as stepping-stones into safely writing about trauma.  Writers choose one stepping-stone to enter their story.  Maybe they write first about how different they are now, then ease into telling the details of what happened in the past.  Another might start with the facts then learn to expand into meaning--how am I different?  what did I feel then?  how can I show that on the page?When prompted to include all three elements, the writing takes a leap up in quality and effectiveness.  Pennebaker and other researchers have documented this:  improvement in physical symptoms, including immune system function, is not uncommon.However Long It Takes--Cultivating Compassion for SelfThis synergy on the page takes time.   I've been working with one writer for three years; he suffered terrible abuse as a child and has used the \"facts\" approach until the past few months, when he began to write about the trauma's effect on his life.  I took longer--almost seven years--to move from writing just the meaning to including the facts about my business failure.  Compassion comes when we realize there is no rush.  I leaned on good therapists, good friends.  I got help.  I began letting myself write \"outside the story\" on days when I had no stomach for writing the tough stuff. I wrote about what happened a year later or a month prior.  I wrote about the main colors in my office, the foods I loved to eat back then, my good times.  It helped take the pressure off, helped me keep writing.  I used morning pages, a technique from Julia Cameron's The Artist's Way  to pour forth stream-of-consciousness writing every day and peel back the layers of resistance to my own story.  Bless this resistance, if you can.  Recognize it as a natural inner gatekeeper that is protecting you from the harm of detoxing too quickly.  Allow yourself the time you need, and get the help you need.  The story will wait for you."},
{"title": "How a Food Journalist Becomes a Book Writer:  The Award-Winning Journey of Steve Hoffman", "date": "Friday, April 4, 2014", "text": "Food writer Steve Hoffman can actually name the date, time and location when he got started:  It happened on June 27, 2012, at 12:30 PM, at Vincent, a French restaurant in downtown Minneapolis.  His family was about to go back to France for an extended stay in the Languedoc region, and at the encouragement of his wife, Mary Jo, they invited Lee Dean, the Taste Editor at the Minneapolis Star Tribune, out for lunch. The Hoffmans were testing a new theory they called, \"Do good work and put it where people can see it.\"  Steve says he spent years keeping extensive journals during the family's travels abroad, sharing them with a select few friends and family members. This, he felt, was good work, but talking to Lee was the first step toward putting this writing where people could see it.By the end of their lunch, Lee had invited Steve to submit a series of \"Letters from France\" to the Taste Section while they were in the Languedoc. Suddenly Steve was not just a tax preparer, landlord, and real estate broker who hoped, someday, to write.  He was a writer with an assignment, a suggested word count, and three very specific deadlines. \"I was a food writer,\" he says, \"almost in spite of myself.\"Eventually Steve's \"Letters from France\" won an AFJ (Association of Food Journalists) Award, and, most recently, the coveted Bert Greene Award from the International Association of Culinary Professionals.     Now Steve has embarked on an even bigger project--writing a book about his experiences living with his family in this remote area of southern France.   From Journalist to AuthorSteve says his book idea came from his wife Mary Jo.  They were sitting in front of the fire, in the midst of the busiest part of Steve's tax season, when he was \"least prepared to think about anything other than how to get through the next day.\"  On Lee Dean's recommendation, they had submitted \"Letters from France\" for a James Beard Journalism award (which he did not win in the end), and Mary Jo pointed out that if Steve did somehow end up as a finalist or a winner, he should really have a book proposal ready to present to the muckety-mucks in New York they'd meet while accepting the award.  A book proposal, of course, presumed that there would be a book.  \"The logic was irrefutable,\" Steve says, \"but it took me several days to ease into the idea that I might actually be someone who could write a book. I had just barely begun accepting that I was someone you could call a food writer.\"    Working as a team, Mary Jo spent a weekend at my book-writing workshop at the Loft Literary Center, learning the art of storyboarding and helping Steve place his journalism pieces and essays on Languedoc into a possible structure.  They discovered it took more than food journalism to make a book, and along the way, a more personal story emerged--the challenges a family encounters when becoming part of a new culture.   The time in France changed them, Steve says, and they experienced a wonderful and somewhat unusual welcome into the heart of the small wine-growing community where they lived--even helping with the vendage, or grape harvest, toward the end of their stay.  As the book grew, Steve built the \"inner story\" thread of his growth and realizations about this community, what it meant to him and his family, and how it changed their lives.   Writing a book isn't easy--much harder than short articles for a newspaper.  Winning the Bert Greene Award became \"a huge source of encouragement and validation,\" Steve says.  \"I wrote the winning article in a single day at the end of last summer, after months of daily writing practice while trying to complete my first draft of the book about France. Although the piece was not written for the book and may not appear in the book, it was written while I was in that late summer writing groove. It was an offshoot of good, daily writing practice, in my opinion, and an example of what abundance a creative habit can produce.\"  Writing Routine--Getting in the GrooveSteve's year is divided into seasons. There is tax preparation season from January through April, \"when all I do is eat, sleep, and prepare tax returns,\" he says. \"Through the rest of the year, because I am self-employed, I can block off writing time from about 8:00 am to 12:00 noon, and schedule work around that daily time slot.\"Steve describes his best working days as \"Big Ship\" days.  \"Like an oceanliner, I am slow to start, slow to gather momentum, but then difficult to slow down once I get going. I like to get physically comfortable so I can sit for a long time if necessary.\"He has done his best writing on the sunny terrace of the family's rented house in Languedoc \"on the most comfortable chaise longue I've ever sat in.\"  He tried to recreate that atmosphere last summer while writing the first draft of the book. \"I would sit on our deck or in the corner of our living room by the fire,\" he told me, \"in a big comfortable chair.\"His most productive days tend to be long days of writing, when there are no work appointments in the afternoon.\"I often struggle through the morning to find the right tone for a piece or a chapter,\" Steve says, \"but then ease into my own voice with growing excitement and confidence. Often on these days, I am writing furiously to get it all down at the very end of an eight or ten hour session, with my laptop keyboard still clicking while I listen to dinner being prepped in the kitchen behind me.\"\"At the end of the best days,\" he says, \"there's an ottoman under my feet and a side table to hold a glass of wine while I read the days' work to Mary Jo--and the kids if they are interested.\"  To read Steve Hoffman's award-winning article, click here.

{"title": "When Your Book Changes Direction--Why Juliann Rich's new book, Caught in the Crossfire, Took Dedication, Hard Work, and Learning New Writing Skills", "date": "Friday, March 28, 2014", "text": "In 2011, when Juliann Rich first decided to write a book, she intended to write an adult mystery. At the time this was her favorite genre to read so she began sketching out her detective and thinking of the murder plot. Then one day at work she had an image flash through her mind: two boys, holding hands in the middle of a bible camp. Yikes. Now that's a book, she thought. She put away her notes on murders and who-dun-its and who-figured-it-outs and began writing their story that night. As the supportive mom of a gay son and as the daughter of evangelical Christian parents, it is definitely true that Juliann has compassion and insider perspective into the central conflicts within her new young-adult novel, Caught in the Crossfire, which will be released in June from Bold Strokes Books. From the onset Juliann says she committed to writing a story that would put her readers into the world of a sixteen-year-old boy struggling to integrate his sexual orientation with his faith. It was also important to this author to depict the conservative Christians in her book as she knows them to be:  people of devout faith who act according to their beliefs and do not see the harm they are inflicting on their GLBTQ loved ones. She says knew the test of whether or not she succeeded with that goal would come when her mom read her book. Juliann's mother called as soon as she finished it.  She said it was a beautiful story and that she wanted to talk with Juliann's son now that she understood his journey better. \"Sharing Caught in the Crossfire with my family was incredibly healing,\" Juliann says.  \"I have a mission for my book it would be twofold: to let gay teenagers know that God's love for them is unconditional and to spark healing conversations within families that are polarized by their differing beliefs.\" How She Began--With Writing Classes!I first met Juliann in the fall of 2011 when she took my online class, \"Your Book Starts Here.\"  \"I giggle now,\" she says, \"but at the time I thought I needed to have a completed draft to take your class, Mary. I wrote like a maniac and completed the first draft two weeks into that first class. At the time I thought I was finished. Remember that? Ah, the bliss of ignorance. Thank goodness for the excellent feedback I got from you and the other writers in that class. I shudder to think of the outcome had I charged ahead into the querying process.\"She went on to take the next level of \"Your Book Starts Here,\" as well as \"Revising Your Young Adult Novel\" with Megan Atwood, and she was chosen for a mentorship with Ben Barnhart, former acquiring editor at Milkweed Editions. In the end she took Caught in the Crossfire through multiple passes of revision. Along the way many aspects of the novel changed.  She switched from third person to first person point of view, rewrote it from past tense to present tense and then back to past tense.  \"This was amazingly helpful and breathed an immediacy and life into my manuscript,\" she says.  \"I read my novel aloud so many times I can quote sections of it verbatim. This allowed me to hear the rhythm of the words, as well as spot redundant or awkward word choices. Eventually I realized that all this work had one goal: to get my forty-five-year-old self out of the way and let Jonathan's (my main character) voice come through.\"By April 2012, Ben Barnhart, her mentor, gave the thumbs up. Caught in the Crossfire was ready for submission to literary agents. Her Biggest Learning Curve\"Acquiring restraint in my writing,\" she says, when asked what was her biggest learning curve.  \"My natural inclination, in writing and in life, is to spoil the people I love. I want to give everything I possibly can. But the best books hold enough back that the reader has to figure some things out. I knew this as a reader--love this as a reader--but it didn't come naturally to me as a writer.\" She also says that writing setting is tough for her.  \"I might have awesomely developed characters with authentic dialogue, but for all the reader knows, they could be floating in the stratosphere having a heart-to-heart. Seriously. This is an aspect of my work that I continue to strive to improve.\" Her favorite character is and always will be the main character, Jonathan Cooper. He has become like another son to her.  \"As an idealist, Jonathan always hopes for the peaceful resolution,\" Juliann says, \"and I love that about him. I just finished writing the sequel to Caught in the Crossfire, and I had to put Jonathan through hell in that book. It darned near killed me to make him hurt so much, but he revealed a resilience and strength of character that surprised even me. That's the cool thing about writing a trilogy. I get to know my characters on the deepest of levels.\"Most difficult? That one's easy too. Jonathan falls in love with Ian McGuire, also sixteen, also gay, definitely not into the whole \"kum ba ya\" thing, as he puts it. Ian is a deeply wounded boy who expresses his hurt through rage. \"Anger is a challenging emotion for me,\" Juliann says, \"so writing Ian pushed me to take huge leaps of growth as I explored emotional truth. For that I will always be grateful to him.\"  How Did You Find an Agent and Sell Your Book to a Publisher?\"I did two things simultaneously after finishing revision on Caught in the Crossfire. First, I established my social media presence: my website (www.juliannrich.com), a WordPress blog, and my Twitter and Facebook pages. I focused all my sites on communicating one message: why I was the right person to write Caught in the Crossfire. I wanted interested literary agents who might Google me to see an established platform and to know that I am willing to partner with them in the promotion and marketing of my book and brand,\" Juliann says.She recommends a great resource to learn how to build a platform:  Get Known before the Book Deal by Christina Katz. \"Is this mandatory?\" she adds.  \"No. Great writing will land that deal with or without a social media presence. But it's an edge, and I wanted every possible edge going into querying.\" The second step she took after establishing her platform was to prepare the proposal package: a tightly written query letter, synopsis, blurb and tag line. She used the following books to research literary agents and to help her learn how to write a proposal package according to industry standards: How to Write A Book Proposal, Michael LarsenHow to Get a Literary Agent, Michael LarsenGuide to Getting Published, Writer's Market2012 Guide to Literary Agents2012 Writer's Market, Deluxe EditionA one-year subscription to Writer's Market (www.writersmarket.com) came with the purchase of the book, 2012 Writer's Market, Deluxe Edition, where Juliann could search by genre and subgenre. This was amazingly helpful, she says.  She chose Young Adult (genre) and GLBT (subgenre), hit search, and a beautiful list of literary agents who were looking for books like Caught in the Crossfire appeared. It even provided links to their websites where she could read their submission guidelines. Following the agents' submission guidelines is rule # 1, she says. To stay organized, Juliann also kept an Excel spreadsheet to track the agents names, dates of her submissions, and their responses. \"In the end I submitted to thirty-two literary agents. I received five requests for partials (sample chapters) and three requests for the full manuscript.\"In September 2012, one year after she wrote the first draft of Caught in the Crossfire, she accepted an offer of representation from Saritza Hernandez of the Corvisiero Literary Agency. Her passion for GLBT YA lit impressed Juliann.  \"She struck me as capable of navigating the ever-changing scene of the publishing industry,\" the author says.  \"It was a great decision, as she sold Caught in the Crossfire to Bold Strokes Books just months later.\" Pansters or Plotters\"A lot of people put writers into two groups: pantsers and plotters,\" Juliann says. \"Pantsers are people who write with no real outline or plan. They follow the whim of inspiration. Sometimes they discover magic, and sometimes they write themselves into corners. Plotters outline or storyboard or spreadsheet their story. Whatever planning format they choose, they know their plot before the first word is written.\" Juliann wrote the first draft of Caught in the Crossfire as a pantser, mainly because \"I didn't know any better,\" she says.  \"It flowed and it was ugly and messy and wonderful. Once I started taking your classes, Mary, I learned about your W storyboard technique and applied it in revision, where I spotted missing plot points, a sagging climax, and unsupported turning points.\" She approached the sequel, Searching for Grace, thinking she would save herself all those levels of revision by plotting the book from the onset.  She had her arc, her turning points, her \"W\" storyboard all filled out, but it didn't work. The story was too dark, too rigid. It lacked the spontaneity and element of surprise that Juliann loved about Crossfire. \"So I threw out my outline and went back in blind. I let my characters lead me, and it made all the difference in the world to the sequel.\" She has concluded that writing processes exist on a spectrum with plotters on one end and pantsers at the other.  \"Me? I'm best when I'm fluid,\" she says.  \"I have learned to hold the novel loosely in my mind in the drafting stage. Allowing my characters to breathe and influence the direction we go in, yields the most authentic and unique first draft for me. I love that moment when my characters show up on the page with something they're dying to say. That's the best stuff, if you ask me, and I need to protect their freedom to do that.\"However, once that first draft is pulled together, in all its gore and mess, I am a plotter in the truest sense of the word. I flip on my editorial brain and examine my manuscript from the outside in, looking for ways to cut away the excess and let the most potent truth shine through.\" Caught in the Crossfire will be released on June 16th, 2014 from Bold Strokes Books. It is currently available for preorder through  www.boldstrokesbooks.com, Amazon, Barnes & Noble in Trade Paperback as well as eBook format. After its release it will also be available in most public library systems and in many bookstores.

{"title": "What's Keeping You Accountable to Your Writing?", "date": "Friday, March 21, 2014", "text": "Here it is, the first day of spring for us in New England, and I'm both eager and nervous.  Snow still covers the yard, but the light is stronger and birds are in their nesting frenzy.  Days pass quickly.  Outdoors will become part of my life again soon.I'm a passionate gardener and kayaker.  So spring, summer, and fall predictably pull me away from my writing--big time.  I'm eager to get back to the quiet water and the glide of my kayak.  I crave walking barefoot through the new garden, feeling the soft air.  But here's my concern:  Will I slowly abandon my book as the warm weather calls me away from my desk?There's nothing wrong with this--but my book is really important to me.  I made a commitment to it last year, to take it through final revision.  I have given the feedback time to simmer.  I have drafted a plan of attack.  But it takes sitting down at the desk and putting in the time.  And I love it, if I have some way to make myself show up every day.About this time of year, I set up or renew an accountability system for myself.  I know what will happen if I don't.This Week's Writing ExerciseThis week's writing exercise is to explore and try one of the systems below, or use one of your own.  See if you start a new rhythm of accountability, perhaps writing five out of seven days each week.1.  Sign up for a class where you have to write each week.  I like to sign up for an online writing class in fall and spring.  I'm comfortable with the format and I love the anonymity of virtual gatherings.  I look for classes that require me to practice new skills and workshop (share) my writing each week, if possible.  Launching into a new writing community is scary at first, but I have experienced only positive results.  Often the group is so fun to be with, we stay in touch after the class is over.2.  Call a writing buddy and set up a check-in system.My second accountability tool is to renew my connection with my writing partners.  Set up freewriting sessions with a writing buddy.  Monthly or weekly or daily check-ins, depending on how much you write.  3.  Try Jerry Seinfeld's technique:  Create a chain you don't want to break.Jerry Seinfeld's productivity secret is a technique he used when he was just starting out.  The goal is to not break the chain of red X's on the calendar.  LifeHacker also offers online calendars to use for this technique.  Works great for anyone who loves to-do lists.    Bottom line:  Most of us, even very disciplined folks, need something to keep them going.  If they know that others are depending on them, waiting for them, expecting something, they'll try to deliver.  Writing a book is a long-term process and these accountability systems not only support you but get you to, as one student put it, \"shut up and just write.\"  That's all that counts, in the end.  Whether you write.  Or not."},
{"title": "\"Did I Write That?!\"  What Happens to Your Writing as You Grow in Skill", "date": "Friday, March 14, 2014", "text": "Practically every week, I get an SOS email from one of my students.  They've just discovered a clue about their book manuscript.  A light bulb has gone off--they realize something they didn't know before.  That's very cool.The SOS is a cry for help, not because of this newly realized writing skill, but because they've read back into earlier chapters.  \"I can't believe I really wrote that crap,\" they say.  \"And now I have to redo it all.\"Maybe poets and short-story writers and essayists don't run into this desperation.  A book writer will, certainly.  Because a book manuscript is a long writing effort.  It can take a year or three or ten to get it tight and right.  We begin writing our book with a certain raw understanding of the story.  Most times, we have a limited view of our characters, plot, or topic.  We have no clue how appropriate page-turning tension will manifest on the page.  This is good and necessary.   Growth has to happen.  The writing process isn't static.  As time passes, as we learn newskills, we see our book in a new light.    I remember hiking the Grand Canyon.  There was the trail, then there wereplateaus or ledges where you could rest and admire the view.  Book writersare on the trail, then they are standing on the plateau.  They look atwhat they've done and see it differently.  That's absolutely required.But the depression sets in because we see how rudimentary our early draftsare.  We think:  Was all that hard work wasted?  Should I havegotten the MFA, taken the writing classes, upgraded my skills before startingout?It's never wasted time.  We acquaint ourselves with our ownstories--fictional or non--by immersion in them.  By practice.  Likebecoming fluent in a foreign language, each book requires our time and lovingattention.  If you consider it a practice, it helps relieve the sense ofpressure that you have to get it right the first time through.Allow yourself room to grow.This Week's Writing ExerciseHere's what I say to my students when they ask what to do with those SFD (shitty first draft) chapters that are sobelow their current skills.  Consider them in three levels.  Askyourself these questions about what can be salvaged.1.  Content: Is there content here that I can still use?  Perhaps the sceneitself, the research, the idea is intact.  Maybe it's OK,content-wise.  That's a huge step.  Continue to question #2.2.  Structure:  Is it just a matter of placement (structure)?  Maybe this particularsection needs to be located elsewhere in the book, and I didn't see thatbefore.  Many writers pile backstory into the beginning of a manuscript,as a way to establish the story's credentials.  Once the story is strongon its own, the writer sees that background information is less needed. But it's still good, and it can be moved to a later spot in the manuscript,where it flows better.3.  Language:  Is the content OK and the placement (structure) working fine, but theway the writing comes across feels awkward?  When we begin a book, weoften \"tell\" ourselves the story.  The narrative is dry, lessscene-oriented, less demonstrated (shown) than delivered.   It'ssimply a question of taking the good material you already have in place andreworking the language, the balance of scene and summary, the show/tellratio.  Writing a book is an act of discovery.  If youknow it all before you begin, there will be no surprises.  And if thewriter is not surprised, the reader won't be either.Keep your early drafts--there's often gold in them.  Or at least enoughshine to capture and build on."},
{"title": "Personal History:  Where We Come From and How It Informs Our Writing", "date": "Friday, March 7, 2014", "text": "When my first novel was published, the most common question I got was:  Is this autobiographical?  How much of your life is in this book?I don't know why readers, and interviewers, wonder about that.  Maybe they are trying to see the writer behind the words, align the real life with the made-up one.  I think the deeper question might be:  Where did you get your stuff?  where did these ideas come from?I couldn't match myself with any of my characters, truthfully.  They were in their late teens, for one.  I barely remember those years.  Glad not to.  They were falling in love for the first time.  I do remember some of that.  One was a championship waterskiier--not me, for sure--and the other was a budding artist--yes, some of that is in my life too.  The location was real, a place I'd spent many summers.  But the story taking place on that lake--the name of the lake, too--was completely made up.I saw their disappointment when I said this.  No, it's not my life, my history.  But the question made me think.There was a lot of me in that story, even if the facts weren't from my life.  There was emotional truth, things I value and believe.  Like helping others and doing the right thing.  Like pain and heartache and taking risks.  Like trying to figure out your place in the world, and if you even have one.  And relationships too, echoed some of my personal history.  I grew up with a talented but frustrated artist for a father, someone I loved but didn't get close to until near his death.  My mother was equally talented--and she, like the fictional mother in my novel, flew small planes for many years.  I'd even lost a sibling unexpectedly, as Molly, my heroine, almost did when her brother had his boating accident.  So, if I tallied up the similarities of emotional truth, there were quite a few.    I had a better answer for those questions.  Yes, there is much of me in this book, even though it never happened to me.  It's a collage of who I am, how my personal history informs my writing.Why We Get Stuck as WritersI remember when I was working on the novel.  I got stuck.  A writing friend said to go back to myself, rather than to my characters.  \"Mine who you are,\" she said.  I imagined myself a character in a novel (and sometimes, don't we all feel like one!), with values and beliefs, preferences and fears, things I knew and things I didn't know.  Not the facts of where I grew up, but what I learned about mind, heart, and life in general because of this place, this family, my education, culture, religion, and friends.  From my travels and the books I read.I realize my effort to make something completely apart from myself was exactly why I was stuck just then in my writing practice.So I began to reacquaint myself with my own personal history.  Not the facts, but the truths of it.Writers can get stuck for a lot of reasons.  But a big one for me is not bringing myself into my own writing.  I have to acknowledge and use my personal history.  Otherwise my writing is unsatisfying, and I start to avoid it.  I'm not talking about the facts of your history, although that will certainly feature in many books.  But don't let the facts get in the way of the truth.   This week's exercise is what I used to say hello to myself again.  It enriched the writing I did in all the months that followed.  I've adapted it from many sources, but I want to give a particular shout-out to life coach Nancy Okerlund, author of Introverts at Ease and the e-newletter, Introvert Energy.This Week's Writing Exercise1.  Spend a few days listing your values.  Focus on the top ten.  Maybe you'd list \"being a good neighbor,\" \"order and beauty,\" \"honoring diversity,\" \"having enough money,\" or \"solitude.\"2.  Sit with these, maybe even discuss them with a non-critical friend who knows you well.  You're trying to come up with a picture of yourself.  What you believe is most important. 3.  Finally, consider how these values appear in your book.  Are they present at all?  The story may have characters who demonstrate the opposite of your values--that's still having values present in your story, especially if the character realizes some truth by the end.4.  If you're stuck with your writing, see if placing one of your values into a chapter might make a difference."},
{"title": "Getting Started Again:  Writers' Tips for When You're Stuck", "date": "Friday, February 28, 2014", "text": "I get stuck with my writing regularly.  Don't you?  I stop for day or two or six, and I have a terrible time getting started again.  Over the years, despite thinking I was the only one, I've learned that almost everyone who writes, professional or not, faces this stall-out occasionally.  What a relief!  I was convinced I lacked self-discipline, my story was a poor excuse for literature and contained no inspiration to keep me going, I was insane to think I had time to waste with spec writing, or I didn't have the emotional or spiritual stamina to write deep stuff. Actually, stall-outs are just time-outs, and lots of good processing happens.  You think about your story, whether it's going where you want.  Whether it's rushed or bloated and where.  You mull over how to solve certain problems in the chapters.  Time-outs are because you ARE working on your writing.But getting started again--that's another story.Once you learn that time-outs can be OK, you still have to know when to get back to work.  Otherwise, it becomes procrastination.  And we all know all about that.Tip #1:  Making a Good HabitMost pros say, \"Just start.\"  It's true, that's the solution.  Sit down, open the document, type something.  Or pick up the pen and begin describing what you see.But most of us don't believe it's that simple.  We have a thousand reasons we're not ready to start again.  Truthfully, we dread opening that document because of what horrors (bad writing) it could reveal.A routine helps this.  Just like going to the gym.  Or yoga class.  How many bound eagerly toward those, day after day?  I thought so.  Me neither.  But once I'm there, I love it.  So, having a yoga class to get to by a certain time helps me bypass the excuses.  Writing routines do the same thing.  In my online classes, students post every Monday morning.  If they buy into the beauty of this simple requirement, the routine aids them.  Even if they don't remember until Sunday night, they still do some writing.  Peer pressure from their small group--and me.  It becomes a positive habit and the brain and body cooperate.  It's almost as if we fall into a happy groove.When there's no outside reason to write, nobody to be accountable to, it's harder.  I've set up artificial deadlines for myself.  An email agreement with another writer or group.  That works.  As long as someone cares, I am more likely to overcome my own resistance and get my own writing engine cranking again.I write more, and more often, when I have a routine.Tip #2:  LinkageThere's a cool technique to get started fast.  It's called linkage.  Many pro writers use it.  It's astonishingly simple but it works.It goes like this:  stop in the middle of a sentence.  When you are finished writing for that day, be sure to stop in the middle of a sentence.This causes great discomfort for the linear mind.  It loves to finish things (at least mine does) and will do everything to get you to complete that sentence.  Because you are trying linkage, you won't.  So the next morning, the linear mind will be very itchy and beg you to get back to the writing, just to finish that link.  So you do, and of course you write more.Good trick.  Works every time.Tip #3:  Brainstorming ListIn my online book-writing classes, we use a brainstorming list.  We create this list early in the twelve-week course.  It's simply a list of possible prompts, possible \"islands\" or scenes, possible ideas for the book.  Each writing session, you pick one.  You tell yourself you'll write for 10 minutes, that's all, about anything to do with that item on the list.Tip #4:  Questions ListThis works in a similar way to the Brainstorming List but it's especially great when you're deep in deconstruction mode and feel stumped about new ideas.  Use your creative imagination by making a list of 10-15 questions about your book.  Any question is fair game.  Silly or serious.I usually have big ones--\"How can I solve the unbelievable ending?\"--as well as small ones--\"What's the real significance of Molly's necklace?\"  Make your list without censoring anything.Like with the Brainstorming List, pick a question.  But instead of writing, let it roll around inside for a few hours.  Especially overnight.  Seems like we can dream the answer, the new ideas.  You may wake up with great ones.  I often do!Important:  form the questions as actual questions.  Not \"I need to know how to end this $%#& book.\"  But \"What's a way I can end this book?\" or \"Book, how do you want to end?\"The form of an actual question makes this tip work.An additional tip:  Some pros end their daily writing session by jotting down 3-4 questions about the day's writing or the next day's concerns.  They use the overnight to let the questions percolate.  Tip #5:  Take a VERY Small StepFor years I used Anne Lamott's idea of the small empty photo frame on my desk.  The opening was only 2 inches wide.  I told myself I only had to write as many words as would fit inside.  About 25 words.  Lamott gives this idea in her wonderful book on writing, Bird by Bird.It really worked.  What's 25 words?  About 5 minutes of scribbling.  And just enough to trick myself into writing more.  I'd look up, an hour had gone by.  Woo-hoo.   I was back in the saddle.  Unstuck and into my book again!  One small step to fool the Inner Critic, one giant step back into my writing life."},

Power in Characters and Power in Locations--How Good Pairings Raise Tension in Your Novel or Memoir", "date": "Friday, October 25, 2013", "text": "A writing rule I wish I knew when I started out:  to create tension in your scenes, two or more elements of power must be combined.  \"Power\" in literature means the ability to evoke change in the status quo.  If you play it safe, you'll keep this from happening with your characters or locations.   Your writing will lack tension to drive forward, to become a page-turner, to irrevocably engage a reader's interest.The writing rule about power is an antidote to the unconscious desire to play it safe--which many writers struggle with.  This rule reminds you to make sure each scene has at least two power elements.  Three is even better.  You want that itchy friction that keeps a reader wondering what's going to happen.   Read more »"},

(Author, Publisher, Entrepreneur)", "date": "Friday, March 8, 2013", "text": "Most writers know at least one self-publishing success story.  A famous one, almost an urban legend by now, is the story of Amanda Hocking, of Minnesota.  She needed a couple hundred dollars one day, so she decided to self-published her paranormal romance.  In twenty months, she sold 1.5 million copies of her e-book and made $2.5 million.  Not only that, but she signed a huge deal with St Martin's Press.  Self-publishing used to be called \"vanity press,\" because only the vain would consider it.  Now it's earning more and more respect from both authors and publishers.  Agents regularly scout the self-published books on amazon.com to find new authors who are making it big there.My indie-released songwriter friends never understood why writers are so  hung up about self-publishing.  Musicians have long separated from the  labels and ventured out on their own, releasing their own CDs and  working with indie distributors like cdbaby.But we writers have been told that unless we get an agent and go the  traditional route, we'll never be taken seriously in our writing  careers. Now, everything has changed--and we'll never go back, I believe.This allows writers much more freedom and many more options.  It's all good news for us.Read more »"},

notebook.   My writer's notebook is not fancy--although if you are really into journals and cool paper, it can be.  It becomes the place where you begin making a map for your book.  This map is something you create as you go.  It starts easily enough with a written conversation between you and your book project, and this conversation takes place in your writer's notebook.  In it, you will begin \"talking\" with your book on paper, and from the answers that come, you will create your book's map.  During the book-writing journey, your writer's note­book will become a valuable aide.  Think of it as kind of a writerly Pinterest all your own.   My favorite writer's notebooks are made by Claire Fontaine.  They come in all kinds but the best are grid lined inside.  Although made in France, they aren't very expensive (so you can scribble and not be neat!), yet they feel classy and interesting.    Whatever kind of writer's notebook you go for, use it to collect these kinds of things: inspiring quotes on writingideas for scenescharacter sketchesresearch notesphotos and images that resonate with your book ideasnippets photocopied from other booksdescriptions of settings you like (with photos!)interviews with characters lists of questionslists of \"islands\" (scenes) you want to writecontinuity checklist for revisionquery letter ideasplaces to submit your manuscriptfeedback notes from readersfreewrites The list goes on.  It varies by individual writer.   My writer's notebooks become like an artist's sketchbook over the time I work on my book--full of images and ideas for things I want to include in the book at some point.  It's my place to keep them safe, like a creative to-do list.  I love browsing through my writer's notebook whenever I get stalled out or need perspective on my book project.     This is a repository for whatever might deliver both inspiration and signposts when I get lost.  I use it until the book is published.  Tool #2:  A Storyboard (Preferably Using Scrivener or Another Desktop Storyboarding Software)At my workshops and online classes, I guide writers through creating a storyboard for their books-in-progress.  Storyboards are a gift from the film industry and many publishers use them to check a book's structure and flow.  Writers use them to (1) brainstorm a plot or sequence for their book when first starting out and (2) keep an overview along the way.I make a storyboard and revise it several times for each book I write.  It replaces the publisher's editor, who did this for my early books (when publishers had editors in house).   I published 12 books with hand-crafted storyboards; they worked great.  Then, a writer at my annual Madeline Island retreat showed me a software program that did it better--and was completely intuitive.  It transformed my storyboard life. Called Scrivener, it was only available for Mac.  I had a PC.  But I'd been thinking about converting to Mac for several years.  Then I learned about a program called Paralells that let me run both Windows and Mac platforms on a Mac Air.  Sold.  Bought the Air, downloaded Scrivener, and have been a happy camper since.Although I've explored other storyboarding software, Scrivener remains my all-time favorite for organizing my book via storyboard.  At $45, it's a great deal too.  Check it out at www.literatureandlatte.com.  Here's a great video that talks about setting Scrivener up for character research--including making an inspiration board with images.   Using Scrivener to Brainstorm Characters    Scrivener takes a bit of time to set up.  I copied and pasted my chapters into it (50 chapters took me about 2 hours) from Microsoft Word.  Then it took another couple of hours to synopsize each chapter onto Scrivener's bulletin board and its index cards that can be shuffled around.  But each of these cards is connected to an \"island\" or a chapter, and you can move them as you need, so nothing is set in stone.  Each can be expanded too, so you can write more than would fit on a regular storyboard's Post-It note.    The coolest thing about Scrivener is the binder, a column to the left of the page which lets you see your book's organization at a glance.  My friend at Madeline Island had hers set up by the three acts, with individual chapters listed under each act.  I did the same, adding the name of the point of view character for each chapter.        Tool #3:  An Inventory List Nicki, a memoir writer from the Boston area, emailed me last week about her need for some way to \"navigate between islands of writing that are now each in separate word documents.\"Often I am writing a new island,\" she said, \"that covers a topic I know I have written about before.  But there is no easy way to search for it within separate Word documents unless I go through each on individually.  This would be time consuming as I have a lot of them.\"Maybe I need to start keeping my writing in some other format?  This has become a crucial issue/problem.\"Nicki may benefit from an inventory list.  Scrivener's bulletin board is an easy way to create one.   Before Scrivener, I did an inventory list manually.  It was routine maintenance for my book at the end of each week of writing:  I added to and updated this list of islands and chapters religiously--it was too easy to get lost and repeat scenes, otherwise.  To make this maintenance easier, I learned to set up my book in an \"island\" directory when I began writing.  Here is an example of an island directory from my latest book, Your Book Starts Here.Nonfiction Books (main directory) --Your Book Starts Here (specific book in progress--working title) --Chapter One islands (what I think might go into chapter one) --three questions (names of islands) --Greece trip--top reasons we write books--Margo's story--David's story--Linda's story--exercise for three questions Sometimes I date the islands as I create them, with a version number, such as \"Greece trip 12.2.10 v. 3.\"   When you get into the hundreds of islands, as it sounds like Nicki has, this can help you sort and search easily.I also create a master file for all the islands, which makes it easy to do a global search for scenes or snippets by key word. Tool #4:  Character TimelinesThis is a good tool for all genres, even nonfiction writers who are including research about real people, interviews, or anecdotes and want to be sure they aren't repeating information.  Character timelines are another kind of inventory.  They record what kind of major and minor events you've included so far--or what you need to include in future.Start by drawing a line on a large sheet of paper, like a river.  I draw one character timeline for each of my main players--anyone I want to keep track of as the book grows.    Then, using Post-It notes (one color for \"written\" and another for \"to write\"), place events and important information about this character along the timeline.   Essentially a character storyboard, you can use this timeline to check character growth.  Does the person actually grow and change, and are the stages of growth linked to outer events?   Character timelines also show you immediately if you have dropped someone out of your story.  (As I did, with one of my heroine's love interests in a novel . . . ooops!)  Or if  you've repeated anything.   Perhaps Nicki could use this kind of timeline to keep track of what she has included and what's still to come.  Character timelines a big hit at my Madeline Island workshop--many ah-ha's come from working on them.Tool#5:  Printed Drafts in a Binder    I may be old-fashioned in this:  I like to have hard copy (printed copy) of everything.  I back up my files religiously but still . . . I may not print out each island when they are not yet \"continents,\" or chapters, but I will always print chapters-in-progress, even the early drafts.I collect these in a big binder.  Each chapter has its own archives--the earlier versions--filed behind the most recent version which is on top.  The chapters can be separated with tabbed pages so you can flip through the book easily.In this purely electronic age, what's the point of wasting all this paper?If you've ever lost your book-in-progress, you won't need an answer to that.  If you haven't, consider this:  It's an amazing boost to the flagging spirit to see the printed book (even a rough draft).  All those pages make you feel good.  You've done some awesome work here, and this is the result.  I also find it easier to find things in printed drafts than electronically--despite Scrivener's amazing abilities.  I can page through and locate the scenes I need.  Or I can use the tabbed separator pages to cluster ideas for the chapter or document what I've included so far.Maybe one or more of these ideas will help you get your acts together, in terms of organization.  Feel free to post your tips, techniques, and methods below!Your Weekly Writing Exercise1.  Choose one of these methods to try.  Set aside a few hours to put it into place."},
{"title": "Structure--Why It Might Be the Missing Element to Make Your Writing Sing (and How to Balance It with Passion)", "date": "Thursday, July 26, 2012", "text": "Writers come to my classes to learn structure.  There aren't many classes that teach it, I've found, and it's my specialty.  But the desire for structure is often accompanied by certain looks--teachers get to know them!--when I hand out the charts, list-exercises, and storyboard instructions.  Do we really have to exit the creative flow to do this?  Yes.  It's half of the process of writing--whether your goal is a poem or an essay or a full-length book.   But so many writers dislike structure.  I did too, when I began writing books.  I thought, Just write!  And that worked for quite a while.  But when faced with the accumulating scenes, chapters, islands, and continents my daily freewrites became, I was overwhelmed.  And I often stopped, purely because I didn't know what to do next.Keep writing?  Maybe.  But when would this mass of material manifest a book?Wise editors on my first books taught me how structure creates a framework. Without the framing of a house, there's nothing to hang the walls on.  Without the framework of a book, chapters just ride along and eventually flop.I've found structure is a framework for both your book and your writing life--no matter your genre or style.  You may enter your writing conceptually, from action and event, or from the poetry of image.  All will hang better with structure.How Structure Works in Your Writing These past two weeks, I've been teaching at a glorious arts retreat center on Madeline Island, off the coast of Wisconsin in the middle of Lake Superior.  Writers come to these retreats to learn structure for their books-in-progress.   After the writers get adjusted to the idea that structure is actually beneficial to the creative flow, they really begin to enjoy it.  Each day I introduce a new structuring tool.  Storyboards, image charts, character growth arcs, and other techniques let writers get an overview of all their bits and pieces, chapters and ideas.   Over the week, they begin to see how structure supports the book's message.  It makes it more accessible to the reader.We all love the ease of daydreaming about our books; we enjoy exploring and re­searching and letting ideas flow onto the page.  But if this is all we do, it can get in the way of finishing.  Structure tasks take this raw material and give it shape Structure Tasks--What Are They? I find structure most helpful when I feel overwhelmed with too many \"islands\" (scenes or snippets of writing), when I can't see how to proceed, when I've lost the thread of my book--or even its original purpose.  I go to my favorite structure tasks to get oriented again.I also like to use structure tasks when I need more objectivity about my book--if I've gotten too lost in the leaves and need to see the forest again.Some favorites . . .  1. Getting a storyboard started or updated.  Many writers in my online classes or Madeline Island retreat get intense relief when their storyboard finally works--and becomes an accurate a map for their book.   The storyboard helps shape or create a form for your book.  You suddenly see where all the ideas can fit, and flow together in harmony.  (Watch this short video on storyboarding if you're not familiar with the term.)   Storyboarding is a structure task because it condenses and focuses your writing process.  It helps with overwhelm.   2. Re-energizing my daily writing schedule:  When you have a routine of writing even 20 minutes each day, the momentum you build will become a finished book.  Not only that but the routine itself is calming.  You stop wondering if you'll ever get back to your writing--because you know you've committed to a short session the next day.  Just like daily exercises, daily writing practice helps us feel relaxed about the book journey.  It becomes a structure we can lean against and try riskier things.     3.  Going into the details via line editing:   If you need a structure task that takes you deeper into the details, versus toward an overview, line editing is a perfect match.  It's the smallest, most focused form of revising, because it goes line by line through the manuscript.  To really get benefit from line editing, approach it at revision after the content and flow of your story is intact.  Line editing makes adjustments in pacing and language, word by word, sentence by sentence, paragraph by paragraph.  It checks the ending and beginning of each chapter to make sure transitions are strong.   I polled my classes about other structure tasks and these suggestions are their favorites.  They helped these writers feel good about their books again.   Set up a great desk for myself (stop writing on the couch).Clean the clutter on the desk. Talk with my family about getting time to myself for writing each morning.Finally get that new laptop that my teenagers can't use.Storyboard my chapters into a more logical sequence--get rid of the mess.Transfer my chapter files into organized folders on computer.Break my huge manuscript into individual chapter files.Learn Scrivener (a software program that storyboards on the screen). And When You Need to Balance the Structure Tasks . . . Some writers love structure too much.  They spend hours and hours with their storyboards and never get to the actual writing.   Remember that structure alone can't make a book--and neither can free-flowing creativity.  So, both are needed to keep oriented.Also, structure tasks can activate the Inner Critic, who loves to get you down when you're trying something new.  Criticism from others and self-doubt from the Inner Critic wipe out passion very quickly.  I recommend a support system of other book writers when you're first trying structure tasks.  Support is essential to keep your vision for your book alive and well.  Feedback that positively mirrors your cre­ative efforts keeps you confident and believing.  So if you (1) are addicted to structure and not writing or (2) try a structure task and begin to wonder Why am I writing this book? you may need to balance with something more fun that helps you recall your passion for your project.I call these passion tasks, because they let us explore the ever-changing reasons we are doing this creative project--and show us whether we are expressing ourselves in the most au­thentic way.  Write a dialogue (on paper) with your book.Write a letter to Inner Critic to get it to settle down.Make a mock-up of your book cover. Make a collage of any book chapters that aren't work­ing.Make a collage of your goals about your book. Write about why you don't want to write this book-even why you hate and fear it.Cluster or freewrite about what you have read in Your Book Starts Here and how it could help your writing.Find a different writers' group--one you can flourish in. List thirty things you love in your life to remind your­self of your passion.Wear brighter colors--not black.Do you relate to any of these tasks? They come from a diverse group of writers of all backgrounds, cultures, educa­tion, and skill levels.  Maybe one of these tasks will interest you and you will try it for yourself. It is hard work to change your writing habits--to learn to add structure if you're a free-flowing writer, or add passion if you're a linear writer.  The goal is to develop both the flow of creativity and the solidity of good structure in your writing life--and let your book become all it's meant to be."},
{"title": "How to Make Your Writing More Vivid by Putting the Reader in the Picture:  Showing, Not Telling", "date": "Friday, July 20, 2012", "text": "A student in my class, Samantha, was writing a difficult passage in her memoir, recounting the effect of her father's death on her family. In a chapter deal­ing with the day after her father died, Sam described sitting in the kitchen with her aunt, watching breakfast cleanup, trying to   absorb the grief that had descended on everything.  But the writ­ing wasn't delivering the emotional punch Sam felt it deserved.\"It's a really important moment in my story,\" Sam com­plained to me, \"so why do I feel like I'm writing it from an­other room?\" When I read the draft, it did feel as if Sam was absent from the \"room\" of the scene. Rather than experiencing the moment with her readers, she was observing it from a pre-digested distance. I asked Sam to write out a list of details about her aunt's appearance that morning. She wrote: messy hair, clothes didn't match, and she picked at her fingernails as we ate breakfast. She added these in, good details to describe an upsetting mo­ment in someone's life, specific and real. But Sam's passage was still not vibrant with the impact of grief. It wasn't a \"felt\" emotion, only a thought. \"Perhaps it's because you're telling us about her,\" I sug­gested, \"and you need to show her to us.\" Effect of Showing, versus Telling Showing and telling are familiar terms to most writers, but many have no idea how to put them into practice. I asked Sam to close her eyes and put herself back into the moment at the kitchen table the morning after her father died. \"Watch your aunt move around the room, cleaning up from breakfast,\" I said. \"Pay attention to any particular de­tails you notice about the setting; note the tension, journey back into the intimacy of that moment. Be open to what might appear that was forgotten in the writing.\"It took focus. It took some bravery--because this wasn't an easy event to remember. Eventually Sam jotted down four things:1.  A rotten smell came from the garbage can. 2.  My aunt's lilac sweater was buttoned funny, odd because she was a good dresser, a fashion maven.3.  Her hands shook-they were so unsteady, she dropped a glass in the sink.4.  She left the glass pieces in the sink.When Sam wrote this last item, tears came into her eyes. She was now \"in the room\" of the scene, fully present with the emotion that had been eluding her.  The glass pieces remained in the sink all morning--and sun from the window made them sparkle enough to catch the attention of anyone coming into the room--thoroughly demonstrating the emotional shattering the family felt.  This bit of \"shown\" story released the memory and its potency for Sam. She wrote furiously that week, reworking the scene and expanding the image. She wrote about how it bewildered her, at eight years old, that no one cleaned up the glass. Finally, Sam recalled that she herself had found a small hand broom from under the sink and took on the task. It became a powerful scene in her memoir because she allowed herself to feel the intimacy and vulnerability of real in-the-moment grief. She successfully moved the memory from telling to showing.Show Demonstrates, Tell DescribesShowing is a demonstration of emotion through spe­cific sensory details--sight, sound, smell, texture and tem­perature, taste. Anton Chekhov reminds us, \"Don't tell me the moon is shining; show me the glint of light on broken glass.\" Telling backs away from such intensity; it summa­rizes the feelings from a distance. Showing places the reader squarely in it.  Telling demands reflection, an almost-intellectual as­sessment of what happened. Showing dies with intellectual language. It relies instead on words revealing externally felt sensations from all five senses. Telling is usually safer for the writer. It's not as raw. To show well, my student Sam had to be willing to travel fully into the moment and re-experience it. Sam said little about the meaning of the glass left in the sink. Because the \"show­ing\" was so accurate, a reader caught immediately why the glass was a strong sign of the family's grief. Gateways to EmotionRobert Olen Butler, author of many stories and novels, talks about this in his book From Where You Dream. Butler ad­vises us: To deliver emotion in its purest form, don't dilute it with even the tiniest bit of interpretation or lack of specificity.  Butler proposes that emotion can be shown in five ways. Using these, I was amazed at how effectively they trans­formed my writing by revealing how to show, not tell.  Here is a checklist for how I've used his terms and ideas in my own writing for an emotional punch.  *   Details about sensations inside the body (goose­bumps on arm, itchy ear, tight throat)*   Specific gestures or expressions seen in others (tearing a small paper napkin into bits, jiggling foot)*   Specific memory from the past*   Fear,anticipation,or a desire projected into the future*   Sense selectivity (when all but one sense goes away during moments of extreme emotion)Whenever I need to change a scene to more \"showing,\" I will go through Butler's list and ask myself how I can bring in one of these. Sam used the third one--memory--and the specifics of the broken glass left in the sink.Writing PromptsWhen my linear brain is over-controlling my writing, it often comes out more \"tell\" than \"show.\"  A great way to break the linear hold is through 10-15 minute freewriting sessions, using writing prompts.The following exercise shares some of my favorites.Your Weekly Writing ExerciseHere are a few of my favorite prompts, adapted from ideas in a wonderful book called Everyday Writing by Midge Raymond.  Choose one, set a timer for 10-15 minutes, and go.You can use these from your own point of view, a character's point of view, or your imaginary reader's.  Try to incorporate showing as much as possible, through use of the senses of sight, smell, taste, touch, and sound.1.  Write about what you're wearing on your feet right now (or not wearing) and why.2.  Write about a time you cheated or lied and what happened.3.  Describe yourself at five years old.4.  Write about an awkward moment.5.  Pick two of these words and write about them, in a scene or memory:  hay, frost, lipstick, Jell-O, pipe."},
{"title": "Three Writers, Three Writing Journeys--How  Three First-Time Book Authors Found Their Way to Publishing", "date": "Friday, July 13, 2012", "text": "Nancy Okerlund, Nancy Wood, and Sylvia Gravrock all have something to celebrate. Their first books have been published, and readers are loving them. I worked with each of these writers, getting to know their stories intimately, helping them stay the course. It's not easy, and I'm so pleased they chose to keep going. Now they each have a beautiful book to show for it.Below are some questions I asked them about their writing journeys. Perhaps you will recognize your own journey in their story--and come away encouraged. If you have questions for any of them, please feel free to ask by clicking the link at the end of this article.  When did you begin writing this book, and why was it important to you to write?Nancy Okerlund (Introverts at Ease: An Insider's Guide to a Great Life on Your Terms, 2010): For years people encouraged me to write, but my response was always that writing for its own sake didn't seem to be in me. If I found something that seemed important to communicate, I might consider writing.  Nine years ago I got passionate about being an introvert.One day I thought to myself,  Maybe I could write a book about it. It was a daunting thought, and a book seemed beyond my reach. But the possibility stayed with me and eventually I found your workshop at the Loft Literary Center in Minneapolis, \"How to Plan, Write and Develop a Book.\"  I came through it a changed person: I learned so much I felt like a book-writing insider!Sylvia Gravrock (Alive in the Storm, 2012): On a whim, in the summer of 2006 I packed up everything I owned and moved from Minnesota to Southern California. Not long after I arrived on my son's doorstep, two characters-Callie and Leo-suddenly took up residence on my shoulders. I could see them clearly, but I couldn't make them talk and couldn't make them go away. Five months later, I turned to an online writing class offered through the UCLA Extension program for help.I didn't start out with the intent to write a book. I started taking writing classes with express intent to make these characters go away. One online class led to three. Four months later, when I still hadn't succeeded in finding employment in L.A., I took a job back in Minneapolis. I asked my online writing teacher if she could recommend a place in Minnesota where I could continue learning how to write.She said, \"You have one of the best places in the U.S. right there in Minneapolis. It's The Loft Literary Center.\"After my move, I began exploring what The Loft had to offer. My characters were now talking up a storm, and I used their story to help me learn the craft of writing. I was fascinated to be learning something new again; and this approach to writing, using islands, fit the way my nonlinear brain functions.Nancy Wood (Due Date, 2012):I started this book almost six years ago. Before diving into the mystery genre, I had been working on a women's novel that focused on an open adoption and the relationship between the birth mother and the adoptive mother. When I took it to a publishing workshop, I learned how difficult it would be for me to publish this novel through traditional channels. It was a \"quiet\" novel, and I had no credentials, no MFA, no connections.My goal had always been to publish commercial fiction. During the workshop, we talked about popular genres; mystery, of course, being one of them. With help from other participants, I ended up with a pitch for a mystery around adoption.It was important to me to write this book for a few reasons. Though I don't have direct personal experience with adoption, I am fascinated with all the nuances of the complex relationship between a birth mother and an adoptive mother.  Writing a mystery allowed me to continue to explore that relationship, but in a genre that was more marketable. I also wanted to see something that I had written as a published book!Any advice to first-time book writers?Sylvia Gravrock: Believe in yourself, your characters, and your ability. Take classes. Most importantly, don't be afraid to mine your deepest, scariest memories and emotions. Because I wrote Alive in the Storm with no intent that anyone else would ever read it, I could be honest with myself. The most common comment I've received since Alive in the Storm was published in May is that the reader feels engulfed in the emotions of the book. That, above all, feels like success to me. I'm overwhelmed with awe and gratitude. Sounds silly, but it's true.Nancy Wood: Don't give up! Keep writing!  My other piece of advice is to read as much as you can in the genre you're writing in. Then re-read, studying how the author created the story. Call it research! I also found that listening to books, rather than reading them, was invaluable. As I listened to books, I often discovered nuances that escaped me when I was reading. Nancy Okerlund: One resource that had a wonderful impact on me is Brenda Ueland's book If You Want to Write. After I read it I gathered up passages that particularly spoke to me and I still refer to them. She gives me permission to trust myself.What's it like to have your book out there? What's the reader response so far?Nancy Okerlund: It's been seven months since my book came out. I'm very happy about it. I see it as a contribution to the growing body of information about the power and beauty and importance of \"introvert energy.\" Reader response has been very positive. Sales have been modest but steady, in this world of online book-buying. (Besides several local bookstores, Introverts at Ease is mainly available from Amazon.)  Nancy Wood: I'm just a few weeks into this, so it's a brand new experience. The Solstice cover artist designed an eye-popping cover that I love seeing on my Amazon page! To top that off, my first Amazon review is a five star one, so I couldn't be happier. I have already connected with a few book bloggers for reviews and interviews. In truth, I feel like I'm walking on a cloud!Any obstacles you encountered along the way?Sylvia Gravrock: My biggest obstacle was forging time to write between work and personal commitments. I believed that writing was a \"pastime,\" and as a result it was usually the last thing on my list. Even though it was the activity that gave me greatest pleasure (and still does), it always came in last. I needed a change in attitude.Nancy Wood: I was my biggest obstacle--procrastination and doubt were my biggest challenges.Nancy Okerlund: A series of serious illnesses and deaths in my family disrupted business as usual and at some point I officially let go of my intention to write a book. But my passion about introversion didn't go away. Then in 2007 I launched an electronic newsletter (ezine) called The Introvert Energizer. Every two weeks I'd write a short essay about what was happening in my introvert lab.  I discovered it was a good way to crystallize my thoughts. It wasn't easy. It took the kind of musing, probing, mulling, wondering that introverts are known for.  But I was getting grateful and interesting responses from my readers. And the ezine became a powerful structure for me.  I felt so responsible to my subscribers that I'd manage to seek out my writing voice enough to meet my deadlines, even when I had to gnash my teeth in the process. I published it every two weeks for two or three years, then shifted into monthly. I continued to get encouragement about the writing. And I also continued to recognize how it kept me in a searching, observant place. And that I'd grown to like this way of writing: brief, self-revealing, informative pieces that almost always surprised me.  How did you land your publishing contract or make the decision to self-publish?Nancy Wood: I'd finished another rewrite and really felt like I'd done everything I could. The manuscript was as polished and as strong as I could make it. I sent query letters to agents with very little response. I had a few nibbles that didn't go anywhere.  I started looking online and found a marvelous array of Kindle books for $4.99, $3.99, $2.99. $0.99, and even free. I purchased some of them, read them, and was impressed with the whole package, from the cover to the story to the editing. I researched publishers, and found Solstice, a mid-sized publisher with a focus on e-books. I submitted the manuscript following the guidelines on the website, and was delighted 12 weeks later to receive an acceptance email, followed by a contract. Nancy Okerlund: I chose to self-publish. I spent a year in a class, designed and led by John Eggen, which gave me another important structure, of support and of access to technical information and resources that further normalized producing a book. One of those resources was CreateSpace.com, the company I used to self-publish. I found it remarkable for its customer service, both online and by phone. I regularly had my questions answered skillfully within minutes of contacting them.What was the biggest turning point in your writing process?Nancy Okerlund: It was a conversation with an experienced publisher that got me back to my intention to produce a book. He assured me that my collection of short essays could become a book. I didn't believe him overnight. But once I did, I began to relate to the ezines differently and it was almost a pleasure to write an introduction for them. Because I'd published these pieces over five years in plain text email, I'd been minimizing their value as book material. But writing them was not a superficial process. And once I chose to believe the publisher, it felt like a miracle had happened: I'd let go of writing a book and then, years, later, it materialized right before my eyes!Sylvia Gravrock: By April of 2010 I'd all but given up. Through your coaching, I'd come to see this story as a potential book, but I was hopelessly stuck and blocked. I hadn't written in weeks, and was honestly on the verge of saying, \"Well, that was an interesting exercise. Time to leave this work behind and find the next adventure.\" (I'm a \"starter;\" I struggle to make myself finishing things.)In one last effort to see if I would hang up this \"writing thing\" forever, I packed up my laptop and notebook and sat in a local Dunn Bros coffee shop. Staring blankly out the window and into a frosty spring landscape, I was disturbed by a woman suddenly standing right beside my table.\"What are you working on?\" the stranger abruptly asked.\"Um. I'm writing a story ... a book.\" (Oh dear God, please make her go away.  How rude of her to interrupt my mental block!)\"Really? What's it about?\" She set her coffee cup down on the table, not about to move until I answered her.\"Well ... it's about a 10-year-old girl who is abducted, brutally raped, and left for dead.\" (How quickly can I spit this out so this stranger will just go away?)  \"Through the experiences of her own storms and trials, her grandmother realizes she's the only one who can reach her granddaughter and help her navigate the storm she's in to safety.\" (Whew! I said it.

I wrote it for this stranger.Nancy Wood: When I was working with you, you introduced me to all the elements of a novel, from inner story to outer story. As a reader, I had always been able to sense when these elements formed a cohesive book, but I had never been quite able to translate them into my writing.  This was my turning point.   What would you do differently, based on what you know now about book writing?Sylvia Gravrock: I'm working on my second novel now. I've learned a lot but feel like I'm a novice all over again. This time, I'm using exercises from Your Book Starts Here and taking more writing classes with the intent for this book to not take five years and ten revisions. If it's possible, I'm being more methodical in my randomness.Nancy Wood: I have always been a writer who needs to write from beginning to end. I need to know what I am writing about ahead of time. I need to know where the story is going and where to plant the clues. That hasn't changed. What has changed is how I approach each scene. I try to think of the inner and outer story as I write.  Anything else you'd like to share with writers?Nancy Okerlund: While we're socialized to believe the value of published work is in sales volume, my encouragement to other writers who are considering or in the process of creating a book is to trust that our voices join a conversation about life that reaches deep into our collective heart.   To check out any of these books, click on the title below Alive in the Storm by Sylvia GravrockDue Date by Nancy WoodIntroverts at Ease by Nancy Okerlund Your Weekly Writing Exercise1.  Think of a question you'd like to ask one or all of these writers.  Post it below."},
{"title": "When Nothing Is Happening . . .Why We Shy Away from Writing Good Conflict and What We Can Do about It", "date": "Friday, July 6, 2012", "text": "Many  people shy away from writing good conflict into their books.  Either they avoid the external side of conflict by keeping events low risk, or they don't let the characters grow through internal realizations.   Unless you have both external and internal conflict in your story, you won't build enough  tension to capture and hold the reader.  And not enough tension usually means a  \"Thanks but not for us\" letter from the publisher or agent you're hoping  to charm.This was verified for me years ago in a writing workshop taught by the editor of a famous literary journal.  Two elements stood out for me.This editor received over 400 submissions each week.  (I can imagine that number has gone way up now.)  He commented on the stories and essays; accepted manuscripts ran a challenging gauntlet. Then he said this:  \"Ninety percent of these submissions got rejected because nothing happened in the story.\"  That surprised me.We discussed why.  Not enough good conflict, he said.  Or there was good internal conflict within the characters or narrator, but this conflict was not externalized.   So it was impossible to engage the reader. The writers, he said, needed to raise the stakes.Raising the StakesA great way to raise the stakes in your story is to ask yourself two simple questions:Who is this person fighting?    What are they fight­ing for?In other words:  What do they want, and what stands in their way of getting it?  In fiction and memoir, characters want things.  A story is about the struggle to get this desire.  It could be the desire for freedom, to avenge a wrong, to secure a mate.  To make the story interesting, there must be a challenge.  If the desire is met without challenge, there is no good conflict.   What about nonfiction?  This editor received many nonfiction pieces.  In nonfiction, there is conflict in the reader.  The writing must create a need in the reader, and a learning curve to satisfy that need.  A reader picks up your story because she has a question, a desire to learn something, for instance.  So the conflict presented in nonfiction is the effort to change or learn.How do you raise the stakes?  Listen to John Truby, Hollywood screenwriting guru, who asks:  Who fights whom for what?   If you can't answer the \"whom\" (the obstacle) or the \"what\" (the desired result), you don't have a good conflict.Using the Storyboard W to Raise the StakesStoryboards are used by many publishers to check out this question.  If the stakes are high enough, when the story is mapped on a storyboard, you can see it immediately.I use storyboards for all my books--fiction, memoir, and nonfiction.  I love the way they instantly tell me where my story slumps.   (If you haven't yet seen my short video on storyboarding, check it out (click here) before you read on.  It'll explain a lot about the W and how to use it to raise the stakes in your story.)One of my students, Matt, was working on his storyboard in class.  Matt was writing a thriller. De­spite a compelling plot idea, we could both see that Matt's storyboard fell flat.  We doublechecked each of his major plot points (the five points of the W structure of his storyboard), but only the first (triggering) event in chapter 1 had enough conflict.   Act 2 was disturbingly peaceful for a suspense novel, causing the middle of Matt's book to really sag.  I suggested that Matt list the name of every major and minor player in one column. Next to each person's name, Matt would write down who this person was fighting and what they were fighting for, using John Truby's question. It was surprisingly hard! Matt could answer these ques­tions only about his villain, his favorite character in the book. All the other characters, including the protagonist, came up blank.  As we talked, I realized that Matt liked these characters way too much. He wasn't letting them get into trouble--or grow!  So he had no external conflict or internal conflict either. I took a different tack. I asked Matt to scan the character list and begin pairing up characters as dance partners. Then imagine these two people having a conversation. What argu­ment could evolve? The goal was to leak out tiny moments of conflict.  This exercise really worked. Conflicts started com­ing fast as Matt visualized these players tangling with each other as they danced a tango. Externalize the ActionBy asking Matt to create an external action--a dance--it became easier for him to imagine dilemma. This is because it's hard for the mind to sense dilemma if it's not dramatized, or made external. We learn about characters by watching them move around their worlds.  Dilemma is rarely believable if it's passive--thought about, talked about, put in letters or emails, or discussed on the phone--without any active outer risk. As you externalize the action in your book, you can complicate dilemma beautifully. You can see if there are any characters who are stalled between what they want and what they think they should have.  A great example of this is Ann Patchett's award-winning novel Bel Canto, whose main character is a Japanese businessman who loves opera. For his birthday, he and other elite guests are invited to a private villa where a famous opera singer will entertain them. The busi­nessman is more than a little in love with this opera singer, but his desire to get closer to her is not something that can be realized unless some outside event happens, a dilemma that will force change--in this case a terrorist take-over of the villa during the recital. Once the businessman and the opera singer are trapped, more action gets externalized. He sees the opera singer ev­ery day, in difficult situations. Emotions begin to play out, because desires are spoken aloud. This is typical during trau­ma--witness the deep friendships and sudden romances of wartime.  Patchett took characters who were safe in unex­pressed interior worlds and forced them into a dilemma in the outer world. If she hadn't, there would be no story. What about Conflict in Nonfiction Writing?   My student Carol is writing a self-help book for women who do too much. Carol's ideal reader is a generous soul, a people-pleaser who spends her days doing for others. Carol was like this too, and that's why she is motivated to write this book.Carol's book contains some great anecdotes, as most modern self-help books do. For Carol's triggering event, she chose an embarrassing and true story of one of her clients who got \"caught\" tending to herself instead of a sick friend. The shame that resulted caused the woman to completely turn her back on her own needs for many weeks, until she got sick herself. Act 1 contained a series of stories like this, as well as good information about the mindset of people pleasers. In Act 2, Carol's book slumped. She only had low-key scenes with little external action. It was pretty easy to build the rising action--stories about women who would simply sneak away by themselves to get some peace and privacy, hid­ing with a good book and glass of lemonade in their bed­rooms. But the falling action, which brought us to a bigger turning point, was more difficult. I suggested Carol look for stories that showed a woman about to burst from being too contained for too long. Yes, the first story showed someone getting sick. Did Carol know of anything worse that had happened when needs were really repressed?Carol thought of a story of her own: a serious confron­tation with a neighbor, who called Carol for a committee favor on a morning when Carol's son was suspended from school.  She remembered how she blew up at the woman. Although it was embarrassing, it beautifully demonstrated what happens when two desires clash--the desire to main­tain the aura of being everyone's helper with the extreme need for privacy to cope with personal pain. When desires clash, there is surprise, drama, action. Carol's willingness to include this \"island\" made a big difference in the overall depth and credibility of her book.  If you're in a similar situation, take a clue from Carol's story. Don't feel your conflict has to be highly shocking to be ef­fective. It just has to be unexpected.  \"The important thing in writing is the capacity to astonish,\" says writer Terry Southern, a screenwriter who worked on films such as Easy Rider and Dr. Strangelove. Shock is \"a worn-out word,\" wrote Southern, but astonishment always makes for good literature.Your Weekly Writing Exercise 1.  Make a list of potential conflicts that couldbe brought out in your book. What kinds of trou­ble could people get themselvesinto? If you’re writing fiction or memoir, list desires and dif­ficulties foreach of your main characters. For nonfiction, make a list of possible problemsthat readers might encounter and how your book solves or addresses them. 2.  Pick one problem and write about it. See ifyou can create a scene where the person faces this problem.3.  Now spend a few minutes with your writingnotebook. Ask yourself how the conflict writing felt—did you notice anything inyour own body as you wrote? Tense shoulders? Headache? Put those sensationsinto your characters."},
{"title": "Get Real:  How to Stop Dreaming about Your Writing and Actually Do It", "date": "Friday, June 29, 2012", "text": "In her brilliant memoir, A Year of Magical Thinking, Joan Didion describes the aftermath of her husband's unex­pected death, how she soothed herself with a year of magical thinking: aligning his shoes just so in the closet, ordering the bills in his wallet, in case he returned. A part of her believed these rituals and ceremonies would make the impossible come true: her beloved husband's death would be reversible.   In her memoir, Didion writes how her rational mind came up with rituals and superstitions and magical ideas to fend off going insane from the uncontrollable pain of grief.Many writers resort to magical thinking when faced with pain in their book-writing journey.This magical thinking surfaces whenever we feel over­whelmed by our own goals and expectations. Instead of ad­justing the plan or goal, we malign ourselves as bad writers. If you don't believe me, recall your last diet or exercise plan. Maybe you followed it perfectly for weeks. Then a crisis at home caused you to skip your workout or eat ice cream from the container.\"I've blown it big time, might as well stop,\" you tell your­self. And you stop. When the blocked day, week, or month leads to \"I'm never going to get the momentum back, and I might as well stop now,\" this is also an alarm sounding.   Re­mind yourself that it's unrealistic to blame yourself that way. Unless everything is absolutely perfect, you're not going to be able to write your book? Not true. A functional writing life is about adjusting and accommodating, making changes as we go. It's not an all-or-nothing lifestyle.A writer who successfully finishes a book expects and allows for the unexpected: getting a winter cold, kids home from school, the dog throwing up on a manuscript, computer glitches, frustrating delays in research.Five Ways to Stop All-or-Nothing ThinkingThese five simple steps work well to create balance, to overcome or outwit writer's block.1. Embrace Creative Multi-taskingMulti-tasking has gotten a pretty bad rap. Legions of burnt-out high achievers of the eighties and nineties lived on the adrenaline high of multi-tasking and it will certain­ly wear out anyone if it becomes a habit.   But I discovered it brings welcome stimulation and perspective and lets me avoid the all-or-nothing syndrome. I just train myself to jump subjects.I learned this in one of my painting classes, when I was struggling with a still life I wanted to kill. Nothing was work­ing; everyone else in the class seemed to be doing beautifully. I happened to be standing next to an empty easel, so I moved my still-life-in-progress to it and started a new painting.When I took a break, the abandoned still life caught my eye. Suddenly, because I hadn't been glaring at it for hours, I saw what it needed.I spent the rest of the class toggling between them and produced two good pieces. When I paint at home now, I of­ten set up two canvases at once. My two easels, side by side, let me get unstuck. I switch often. When I come back to the other canvas, the break has refreshed my eye. I see with new enthusiasm the subject that bored or frustrated me minutes before. I now do this with my writing.I open two documents on my computer and toggle back and forth. While my mind's solving one problem, an idea comes for the other piece. Toggling from a freewrite to a revision keeps me engaged, surprisingly alert, and free of magical thinking.2. Flex Your RoutineWriters who completely avoid structuring their writing time often never complete their books. There's a deep fear of routine in many creative artists.No one stays the same throughout the long process of writ­ing a book. Assume you are going to change as a writer. Make your writing structure flexible enough to change as you do.When I first began writing seriously, routine caused me great anxiety because I thought I had to stick with plans. I thought routine was terribly uncreative-what if an intrigu­ing detour emerged? Could I follow it and still produce a finished piece of writing? Now I know detours are often helpful, but only within a dependable routine to reorient me when I need to remember my original purpose for writing.I now hold a loose structure around each writing ses­sion, showing up for my planned time, producing pages, re­viewing my goals. I'm now willing to stay committed, but also willing to vary my routine.3. Use Your LifeA New Yorker cartoon shows a man sitting on a screened porch in front of a typewriter. Crumpled pages litter the floor. Everywhere are dogs--big dogs, tiny dogs, panting dogs, sleeping dogs. The writer's wife stands in the doorway to the screened porch, hands on hips, exasperated at her ob­viously blocked spouse.\"Write about dogs!\" she tells him.What's on your plate? What are you grappling with right now in your life? Maybe you can use it to unlock the block, get you back on the page. Writing about the ordinary, the life in front of you, will help you reconnect to yourself, restore inner balance, and get you back to your book.4. Force Yourself to Have New ExperiencesThe opposite of fear of routine is obsession with it. If we're not writing, the job is to write regularly. If we are writ­ing about the same stuff, we could be caught in a rut. Too much repetition can lead to creative blocks.If this happens, you need to (1) recognize it, and (2) force yourself to go out into the world so you have something new to write about.When I am repeating myself, it may be that the well has run dry. Or life has become too fast to look deeply. I'm living on the surface without time to think, to find the original in myself.  Julia Cameron's The Artist's Way suggests a choosing brand-new place to go for an hour, solo. Use the time to fill the creative well, open yourself to new experiences, expose your senses to something that nurtures in a new way.Cameron spoke of how regular creative outings were the hardest task she proposed in her book. People loved writing morning pages, doing the other activities, but resisted these dates with their inner artist. Exposing yourself to something completely out of your normal life or to your own inner life-without the speed of distracting activity-can be frightening, but things held at bay suddenly come forward. In a good way.Some outings to consider: visit a new museum, take a walk in a never-explored neighborhood, go for a hike.5. Keep Filling Your WellThe writing life requires intimacy with your own self. Intimacy is about getting close and letting go of what stands between you and your subject.If your writing feels repetitive or dried up, if you aren't writing regularly, consider the level of intimacy you have with your book topic. Are you bored with it? Is it connected with your life?  Consider filling your well.I polled published authors: how did they fill the well? Many suggested activities fostering internal slowness.  Your Weekly Writing Exercise1.  For thirty minutes or so, write about your per­sonal life in each of the areas below. Consider your minimum requirements to feel happy, bal­anced, and healthy. How are you doing in each area? Add any others that are essential to your well-being. physical (getting enough sleep, regu­lar exercise, eating good food, keeping healthy)emotional (time for relationships with your family and friends, enough self-care, enough private time)job/finances/career (meeting your work commitments, bringing in enough money, keeping up with your savings goals)creative life (learning and growing, explor­ing creatively, staying current with your interests)spiritual (practicing your faith, having enough private time with yourself, serv­ing in your community)2.  Take twenty minutes to explore what you need to have in your life, to get your book written. privacytimefeedbacksuppliesresourcesgood, working equipmentflexible schedule3.  Compare the two lists. Does one neglected area on the life list also show up in the writing list? For example, no privacy?4.  Starting small, choose one area from the life list and one from the writing list that could improve.5.  This week, begin one small change."},
{"title": "What Are You Really Writing About?  How the First Essential Revision Tool--Content Analysis--Makes Your Book Engaging to the Reader", "date": "Saturday, June 23, 2012", "text": "Publishers buy manuscripts when they communicate passion for a topic, presented in a unique way that speaks to a reader. To get this passion, revision lets the emotional truths we've learned during the process of writing this particular story come forward. We revise to make this truth as unim­peded and clear as we can.  It's a bit like cleaning a window to let more light in, or as Pulitzer-prize-winning author Wal­lace Stegner said, \"All you want in the finished print is the clean statement of the lens, which is yourself, on the subject that has been absorbing your attention.\"Another way of looking at this: Revision's goal is to let the manuscript become strong enough to stand on its own without the author having to make any interpretations. In my writing classes we talk about \"getting out of the room\" and letting your book and its readers have that wonderful conversation that all good literature fosters. Without you, the author, having to be there to make sure the reader is get­ting it.This concept was frightening to Tom, a first-time book writer, who wondered, What will happen to my theories if I'm not there to explain them? Or worse: If it changes entirely-will it still be mine? Will revision cause it to lose its original spark?     This is where Tom was stuck.Content Analysis--The First StepFor me, the refinement that comes in revision lets in the real music of a book.  There's a sense of multiple sections in an orchestra finally playing together. They create a sound larger than any individual part.But to get this richness of sound, Tom needed to look at revision in each of its three aspects, and in this order: first content, then structure, then language.This week's post talks about the first step--content analysis.  To read about structure and language revision, check out chapter 19 in my book Your Book Starts Here.   Content is the foundation of any book. It's the plot in fiction, the defining events in memoir, the information in nonfiction. There's a certain amount that must be present for the book to make sense to a reader. In a writer's head, the content is there. But when revising for content, you want to make sure it's also on the page.So we take an inventory of the book's content.I like to do it in two stages. I start with the whole man­uscript, reviewing the table of contents or my storyboard of topics. Does each larger section have substance?  If yes, I examine the book's chapters and the material within each chapter, looking for any parts that feel incomplete, where in­formation is missing or extraneous.It is in content revision that you'll discover if you are a naturally contracting or expanding writer. Do you prema­turely edit your \"islands\" too much, so that the first draft feels more like a brief sketch, with sentences counted out like coins? If so, the richness of your book's sound may be underdeveloped and content revision will show you where you need to expand your story.Or maybe you feel unsure about whether your reader will get the picture you're trying to paint, so you add a bit more than is really needed. You sense it doesn't contribute to the story's flow but you're worried about leaving it out. You may need to take a deep breath and choose to delete some content. Less is sometimes more in content revision.Your Questions ListSo, as you read for content, you are going to see prob­lems. You will be tempted to make notes on your manuscript, such as, \"fix this description\" or \"make dialogue longer.\"  Don't do this. Why?  Because it will turn your manu­script into a deadening list of chores that can stop you in your tracks. Instead, craft the problems you see as questions.The first task I asked Tom to try was the questions list. A list of questions will automatically put a writer in the position of cu­rious observer, the fascinated inquirer. They allow you to become open to new ideas that maybe you weren't ready to grasp during the planning and writing stages of your book journey. And ques­tions always attract answers-in a truly synchronous way.Some examples of content questions from Tom and my oth­er students:*   Does the reader need to know more in chapter 2 about listening skills?*   How does John get from the cabin to downtown Poughkeepsie? Do I need to add a     traveling scene as transition?*   Which of Mary's phone calls is most important to the plot? (This writer saw the need to      delete one.)*   How can I best explain the backstory on page 45 in fewer pages?The Extras FileAs I review each chapter during content revision, often I find material that is missing--but equally often, material that has to go.  All that work! I'd spent weeks on some of those paragraphs.Rather than just delete them, I open a new document on my computer. I name it \"Extras.\" It becomes the holding tank for excess sentences, phrases, and paragraphs I still love but don't serve the manuscript. (Once I even put four chap­ters in my Extras file!)It always makes me feel better to know I am not throw­ing these gems away forever. They are safe in my computer, waiting for their right place.  Not surprisingly, I find myself using them later-during other parts of the revision process, for example, when I need a bit more backstory or another line of dialogue.Want to hear more about the content analysis exercise, step by step, and what it's done for other writers?   Your Weekly Writing Exercise 1.  Skim through each chapter of your manuscript;then, at the top of the chapter’s title page, write one sentence that describesthe meat of that chapter—its purpose in the larger story. Con­tinue until youhave all chapters described.2.  Carefully read these sentences in sequence. Are there any placeswhere you see missing steps or scenes that would be needed to make your storyflow better for a reader? Are there any places where you’ve added unnecessarymaterial? This may show you exactly where you need to expand or contract.3.  Now open to a new page in your writer’s note­book.On the top of the page write “Content Questions.” List what you discovered duringyour review, but write these problems as questions, as in the examples on theprevious page."},
{"title": "Going beyond Critique:  Structuring Feedback to Best Help Your Writing", "date": "Friday, June 15, 2012", "text": "One summer I attended a workshop with an award-winning short-story writer.  His writing astounded me, and his stories were favorites for years as I studied the craft.   When I learned he'd be teaching at a well-respected conference that year, I was thrilled.We were asked to prepare a short story for critique.  I polished my very best one, which had won a couple of writing contests, and prepared to learn how to take it to the next level.  I looked forward to this great writer opening doors for me, creatively.  But I took a writing friend along, since at heart I was nervous about his feedback.  If it proved heart-breaking, I could cry on my friend's shoulder.   Each day we listened to this writer rant.  Midweek we began to talk about the stories we'd brought, but he decided only to work on a few stories by previous students of his who were also in the workshop.  Mine got a cursory discussion, as did most of the others.  To say I was underwhelmed would be an understatement.  No creative doors were opened for me, but I did learn a lot about the writer's fame and struggles with his own work--interesting to a point but not for five days.  He was not able to give good feedback because his own writing was his only world.   Sadly, many of us went away from that workshop confused about the writing journey.  Does it really lead to this kind of self-absorption?  Can't writers learn to help each other succeed?  The flatness inside gave me no real idea how to take the next step with my short story.  It found its way to a drawer in my closet and never got looked at again after that summer.     Critique--Only One Model for Feedback Many years went by and I learned more about this feedback and especially critique, the academic method for giving feedback.  The goal of critique is to find what is wrong--it looks at writing with a critical eye and the sense grows in the writer that she will never quite be enough.Critical feedback has it uses at certain stages.  But it works best if delivered with the intent to open doors in the writer's creative self.  Not close them.  I had made the mistake of thinking that this famous writer would know how to teach as well as how to write.   That he would be able to help me.  Actually, he was really only able to help himself. How Do We Get Help for Our Writing?  How Do We Learn to Give it to Other Writers? Writers learn about their writing in several ways.  There's the harsh experience of rejection letters--which tell you everything is bad.  There's the gentle experience of support--which tells you everything is good.  In the middle is constructive feedback.  This points out both strengths and weaknesses in writing.  It lets the writer know the solid ground to stand on, as well as the next step to take to grow.Most writers aren't born with an inherent ability to give good feedback. Even professional writers, as I learned that summer, can be lousy at it. They don't necessarily offer comments that the writer can actually use. And they give feedback for all sorts of wrong reasons-to show off how much they know, to make every­one aware they'd never be caught dead making a mistake like that, to boost literary egos.Obviously, this does nothing good for the receiving author-to-be.  That's why I've come to believe that questions are the most untapped form of good feedback. In teaching writing for over twenty years, I've found that questions open door­ways for the writer. They let us see (1) there's something unaddressed or unanswered here, and (2) there are ways to find out what it might be. When we are asked a question, it allows new information to come up organically from our in­terior worlds. A lot of my first-time students don't believe in the power of questions. But after one exposure, they get it.  You really had to be there, to get the full impact of the question, to see the writer light up with new awareness and love for his manuscript, but perhaps some of these questions will trigger ideas on this form of feedback.1.  What would happen if Jonah didn't say yes to Ann at that moment? (In response to a chapter where two characters fall into a pseudo-agreeability, where they really need to get more separate, this question caused the writer to catapult into an new realization of Ann's angrier side. We'd seen Ann simmering for weeks, but this writer hadn't yet, and it was deadening the chapter.)2.  What's the most outrageous thing this woman could do? (In response to a stuck character, this ques­tion caused the writer to have her go into a bar and bargain sex for a ride to L.A., a totally unex­pected action that was entirely believable and got the writer excited once again about this person.)3.  What was always in your mother's refrigerator? (A memoirist suddenly remembered her moth­er's quart bottles of diet Pepsi, which brought the realization that she hadn't yet written about junk food and constriction, an essential theme in understanding her family.)4.  How does lightning play out in your life? (In re­sponse to a skilled writer's struggle with finding theme in his nonfiction book. He went from writing sequential and slightly repetitive scenes to interspersing musings on the nature of light­ning, personally and topically, which helped his book rise from the ashes.)Any feedback in class needs to be monitored by an in­structor, who has the welfare of the students in mind. If there are writing classes in your area, try them out. Online classes are easy to find and good forums for learning feedback skills.Assessing Your Feedback NeedsA writer in my classes was convinced that he didn't need feedback.  He worked hard on his novel and sent it off to a list of agents.  It was agony to watch him get the rejection letters--not one even read more than a couple of pages.  I suggested he spend some time getting feedback--finding out why.  Because the submission process had flattened him, Noah was more willing to try peer review now.  He found a writers' group in his Detroit neighbor­hood, one he's been with now for two years. He learned to ask good questions and he learned that careful and constructive feedback made his writing improve steadily.  He sees the group members for coffee and chapter exchange one Sat­urday morning each month, and each writer has grown tre­mendously from the feedback.  At first, Noah said, the group was large and not very committed. Over time, the original ten members shrank to five steady writers who showed up at each meeting. Those who didn't submit work eventually dropped away. Noah's writing was gently critiqued, chapter by chapter, until he col­lected good feedback on his entire book. He now knew more clearly why agents never got past chapter 1-and he's hard at work on a more informed revision.To assess your feedback needs, spend some time with your writer's notebook or journal today. As you think about where you are in your manuscript revision, make some hon­est notes about your concerns and eagerness for feedback. Then, when you feel you're ready, take one small step toward reaching out.Go on line, visit community bulletin boards in your lo­cal bookstores, or make a call to the English department of a nearby university or college. Research some possibilities for a manuscript exchange with a writers' group, writing coaches, or writing partner.Discover how constructive feedback can help you take your manuscript to the finish line-and the publication that awaits there.Your Weekly Writing Exercise1.  Spend a few minutes today writing about how you feel about your book, right now.  Are you excited, overwhelmed, discouraged, skeptical?  Describe the feelings as specifically as possible:  \"They feel like . . . \" or \"I feel like. . . \"2.  Now switch to assessing what might help you most at this place.  Begin writing again, finishing the sentence:  \"I think I most need . . . \"  Repeat this prompt 5 times, answering it differently every time.3.  From this exercise, make a list of three things you need most to move forward right now.  They can be specific issues with your book or overall needs you have for support."},
{"title": "Listening with Your Whole Self:  Writing from Both Sides of the Brain", "date": "Saturday, June 9, 2012", "text": "Jess is a smart and polished lawyer who was a dedicated student in my writing classes. After hundreds of law briefs and legal articles, she was attempting a novel, a love story. She had crafted a hundred pages, but she hated what she’d written so far. What was wrong?  We looked at the chapters she had created from her scenes, following her storyboard’s map (see this past article on my blog for a refresher on the storyboarding process).  The basic story idea was good, the plot interesting and well structured. But the writing was way too linear for a love story. Written law-brief style, with romance plugged in, using dry language that sparked no emotion in a reader, even the writer herself was uninspired by it.  But Jess was one persistent woman. She was committed to her story. She knew she had a great book idea. The prob­lem, we realized, was with her writing. She needed to learn how to show, not tell. Training her to listen to the creative side of her brain wasn’t easy. It bucked her natural preference for logic and analysis, for telling. I proposed a plan to loosen her up.      Pay a lot of attention to the senses-taste, touch, sound, smell, sight     Go on solo outings to places inspiring these senses and take notes on what      you see, smell, touch      Begin a touch journal-jot down what things feel like     Read novels and short stories that are strong in images      Watch romantic movies instead of the documentaries you prefer     Begin having fresh flowers in the house and eating home-cooked food     Take long walks and afterward write down favorite images     Listen to music-different kinds than you usually listen toJess was dubious. She cited no time for walks, music, flowers. She said I was asking her to change her life.  Yes, I told her, I was asking her to change but not her life, rather her very left-brain approach to life. I told Jess to get a copy of My Stroke of Insight, by neuroanatomist Jill Bolte Taylor. In this short but stunning memoir, Dr. Taylor reveals how after a sudden left-brain stroke shut down her left brain, she learned what it was like to operate just from the right brain.  For hours after her stroke, Dr. Taylor was aware only of what the right brain delivers--sensory details, images, wholeness of being. In the bliss of right-brain beingness, she was barely able to save her own life. Her left brain, which is home to ordered, logical thinking--the kind necessary to pick up a phone and call 911--had been all but annihilated by the stroke. It would take years of rehab to bring it back to life. Dr. Taylor had to learn all over again how to read, to add, to make decisions. This dramatic experience of losing her left-brain functions changed Taylor’s entire approach to living. She slowed down, did less, but much to her surprise found she enjoyed life more.  As Taylor says, we tend to use more of one side of our brains. We need both. This is especially true for writers. We often miss the full potential of our book-writing journey by not tapping into the right brain. Our manuscripts develop primarily from the voice of our dominant hemisphere, which for most of us is the left. Blind spots appear on our book map because of this, creating unnecessary roadblocks on our journey. We get stuck easily. Alone, neither the linear left brain nor the image-rich right brain can create a complete book. Using the whole creative self delivers both coherent structure and emotional engagement. Both sides working in concert turn every book into a more complete vision. Jess took up the challenge of freeing her right brain. The newly embraced creative self began to speak up. Her writing changed. Novel scenes, very good ones that packed an emotional punch, emerged. What Happened NextI didn’t predict the next event, but I wasn’t surprised. Jess fell in love. She sold her practice, and she and her lover moved to another country. Falling in love is very much a right-brain activity. A person in love suddenly appreciates detail, especially sensory detail. Love changes your percep­tions about everything.   I thought that was the end of Jess’s novel. But six months after her move, a chapter arrived by email. I couldn’t believe the difference. Here was real romance! The writing made my heart jump.She was listening to the right half of her brain-and it changed not only her writing but her life. To date, the book is still in the works. It’s going to be wonderful.“Share this story with your classes,” she emailed me. “If someone like me can make this change, anyone can.” Do you have to fall in love to change your habitually left-brain approach? No. You just need to be willing to ac­cept the parts of your self that don’t make logical sense. Learn to balance the strengths of the organized left brain with the whimsy of the right. Learn to structure your wild imaginings so you really communicate your book’s message.Which Side Do You Favor? As book writers our first task is discover which side is taking up the most room in our creative process. Asking good questions can help you learn which side you are favoring, and which you are ignoring. Good Questions If you are naturally ordered in your writing, ask ques­tions that propel you or your character into awareness of senses, which comes from the right brain:What did it smell like?What sounds did you/she/he hear?What time of day was it?     If you tend toward the meandering and random, ask questions that track time sequence or logic, which comes from the left:What happened right before this?What will up the stakes right now?What could happen next?Our second task is to train ourselves to use both, to switch readily between them, using our whole creative selves and making our books publishable.How many writers are able to seamlessly switch from ordered to random and back again? It often depends on how we approach our daily lives, how fluid we can be. When I surveyed my book-writing classes, writers were visibly uneasy at the idea of such fluidity. (Let’s not forget our culture is very left-brain oriented.)  “My material is way too emotional to access all the time,” said a new memoirist. “It’s a wild animal; I have to keep it contained.” A skilled essayist and mother of three said, “I stay in left brain to survive. If I let myself get dreamy, I get instant chaos at home. I want to write this book but not if it means giving up control of the rest of my life!” This is not about giving up anything. It’s about open­ing up to more, it’s about trusting the part of your creative self that gets less air time. If you’re naturally organized, keep the left-brain control, the structure-it’s essential. Just add in the beauty your nonlinear right-brain self can contribute. If you’re one of the rare right-brain dominant, then you will need to learn to embrace a structured writing system that can help bring order to your freewheeling words. Your Weekly Writing ExerciseThis exercise allows you to access both sides of the brain, back and forth, and strengthen your ability to switch between them, via sensory memory and physical, present-time body sensations.  It's great training for any writer.1.  Find an event from your childhood that evoked strong emotion.2.  Write about it for 20 minutes, using the sense of sound as much as possible.3.  Pause and close your eyes.  Briefly scan your physical body for any sensations that might have arisen as you wrote--are you feeling a bit dizzy, nauseous, euphoric?  Do you have a buzzing feeling in your head or a tightness in your throat.  Write about your present-time physical body sensations for a few minutes.4.  Now go back to the childhood memory and continue writing, using the sense of smell.5.  What differences do you perceive in the second writing session?"},

New writers can start out writ­ing a couple ofparagraphs, building gradually to two pages, about 500 words, per sitting. Twopages is just enough to engage the creative self but not overwhelm it. It'sfine to keep the pages unpolished--and eventually you'll get into a rhythm oflightly revising as you go. The goal at first is simply to build stamina foryour writing practice.  The momentum of the practice gets you enthused,and once you are producing 500 words regularly, you might find yourself uppingit to 800. How about 1000?Fiction and memoir writers might spend their two pages on a shortscene, a description of character or setting, or even a list of unansweredquestions about their story. Nonfiction writers can use this time to buildresearch facts into interest­ing prose, or develop anecdotes to illustrate atheory.Note to those who love to edit their work:  It's important tomake sure revising time doesn't replace fresh writing. If you find yourselfwrestling word choices, try a freewrite to get the creative flow moving again.Getting started can be a challenge.  Anne Lamott, author ofthe modern classic on writing, Birdby Bird, has an empty one-inch photo frame on her desk. When shesits down to write, it reminds her \"all I have to do is to write down asmuch as I can see through a one-inch picture frame.\" Once you start withenough fresh writing for this short assignment, you may find yourself easilywriting more.Don't worry if it's any good--we often can't tell when we'reproducing writing that's fresh. We don't have the per­spective because we'retoo engaged. Plenty of time for the editor self to judge that later.Your eventual goal is simple: two pages, every day, with depth andmeaning. You'll be amazed at how quickly they become enough to make a book.The Brainstorming List of Ideas One of my students is a professional journalist, with many awardsbehind him.  He's writing his memoir now, and when he got really stuck a fewmonths ago, I suggested he begin a list.   He was to write down all the top­ics he might want to writeabout.  Important:  Don't edit or censor them, and include the onesthat terrified and bored him.  Even topics that might not end up in thebook.  Everything went on the list.He did.  With some reluctance.   Once he had the list in hand, he found himself adding to it quiteoften.  He still was stuck, but his imagination was getting involvedagain.  After a few days of jotting down ideas, he had over thirty. And there were a few he couldn't stop thinking about so he sat down one morningbefore the family got up and jotted down some notes.   Of course, you know the end of this story.  The notes got himmore interested.  And soon he was writing.   And he still is.  He hasn't gotten writer's block againsince.  He told me the list insured he always had something to write aboutevery day that was relevant to his memoir.He gave me permission to share some of his list.  Although itwon't make sense to anyone else, it gives you an idea of the kinds of thingsthat can be included:red flannel shirts with leather elbowsmiscarriagedisgust with spudsUncle S. and his smelly pipelaughing too hard at the dinner tablerain on dirty windowsI recommend all book writers start keeping a brain­storming list.It is the key to connecting your current life, your interests, passions, fears,and hopes, with your book. It enlivens the material with you. And best of all,it keeps you writing regularly.Brainstormed ideas don't have meaning at first--not until they'rewritten about. As E.L. Doctorow said, \"It's like driving a car at night.You never see further than your head­lights, but you can make the whole tripthat way.\" Like imag­es caught in headlights as a car passes by, or likenotes taken from a dream fragment, certain phrases or words encapsulatecomplete scenes you'll develop later.Note: For the list to work, you need to jot down enough to jogyour memory.Keeping a brainstorming list is an ongoing task. I sug­gest addingto it at the end of each writing session. Use it throughout your book journey.The last few pages of my writ­ing notebook are reserved for my list, where it'seasy to lo­cate. Some writers start a computer file for their lists, adding oneor two new items every writing session.It's important not to censor your list or eliminate top­ics thatdon't seem to \"fit\" the book. This is not the time to decide. Oftenyour Inner Critic is talking you out of a deli­cious clue from the right brain:an insignificant image that finds its way to your list may become the verything you need to bring emotion to an otherwise dull scene.Ready to try it?  Here are the steps. Your Weekly Writing Exercise1.  Get out your writer's notebook or open a new document on your computer, saved to your desktop or some place you'll see it frequently.2.  Write down 5 topics you're interested in writing about, that could possibly be part of your book or current writing project.  Don't censor the ideas that come--even if they seem off base right now.3.  Save this and walk away for an hour.  Come back and add 3 more ideas.  4.  Do this until you have 25 listed.  5.  Pick one topic from the list and set a kitchen timer for 20 minutes.  Begin freewriting on it, again not censoring what comes through.  6.  Repeat each day for 1 week.  See what you get."},
{"title": "A Letter to Your Inner Critic--How to Stop the Invisible Sabotage to Your Creativity", "date": "Saturday, May 26, 2012", "text": "If I had a way to capture the self-talk inside most writers' brains, as they sit down to do their writing practice, here's what I might hear:“You need a lot more backstory here.”“This section will take months of research. Stop writing and get started. It’ll be a good distraction.”“You need to explain what your character is thinking here. Your writing isn’t good enough to just let the action show it.”“For God’s sake, use bigger words. Everyone will think you’re uneducated.”“Get to the action. How is anyone going to know what’s happening if you go on and on about setting?”“This is pretty boring, you know. Maybe wrap it up faster.”“Your mother will hate this section. Kill it.”“Why don’t you run out and get the dry-cleaning now, then write when you get back?”Who is doing all this talking?  Who is making us hate our own writing?  I call this being the Inner Critic, and we each have one.  The challenge is to figure out what to do about its venomous voice, its worrisome messages, and how to keep writing anyway.I've interviewed hundreds of writers at every skill level about the Inner Critic.  Professional writers, even those who have published widely and won awards, are well acquainted with this inner voice.  Sometimes it's funny, sometimes it's sad, sometimes it's menacing.  But rarely is it truthful--and too often it sabotages our efforts to make art, to do our writing.  Professional writers have learned to calm the voice, to write anyway.  Some relied on alcohol or drugs or distractions to get a word in edgewise.  I've found a better plan.First, it's important to face the facts:  The Inner Critic is part of any book journey—no matter how many books you’ve published.Facing Down the Critic Inside YouYour first step is to disable the Inner Critic's overwhelming influence. I call this renegotiating the contract.  You might think you don't have a contract.  Read on.Common wisdom suggests you fight the IC--use any means you can. Engage it in its own Hunger Games.  But that often turns into a never-ending battle.The way that's worked for me is this:   Get to know your Critic and make it an ally, not an enemy.First, recognize when it's affecting you.  It can be both strong and sneaky. As you explore and plan your book, it might worry that you don’t have a good enough idea. It will rumble in the background, causing doubt that your ideas are serious enough or good enough.Then, as you write your book and form the chapters, it will convince you the draft is definitely in OK shape to show your best friend—right now, today! This, of course, is a not-so-subtle sabotage attempt, made real when your friend asks about missing parts and you crumble with the realization that you have omitted half your story.Or as you revise, the Critic will get bored with inner story, theme, or pacing, those essential fine-tuning steps each book writer must implement. It will even tell you to edit out the juicy parts because all your relatives will shun you when they read them.And as you try to sell your book, the Critic will come into full battle mode. It may suggest you stop now before any rejection letters arrive.It's actually trying to protect you.  Sound impossible?  Here's how I experienced it, with one of my books that was published years ago.  The lesson taught me a lot about how to keep writing, and how to work with the Inner Critic. The Inner Critic as a GatekeeperOne morning, I was finishing up a chapter in my self-help/memoir that centered on my business bankruptcy back in the 1980s. As I wrote, the Inner Critic began flooding me with feelings of shame about my failure. I began writing more slowly, reluctantly. The voice inside my head got louder, warning me to stop my exploration. “Why bring up this all over again?” it argued. “Totally in the past, not helpful to anyone else. Let it be.”I persisted, angry at its interference. Suddenly I had to run to the bathroom. I was very ill, vomiting and dizzy. As I lay on the bathroom floor, the cold tiles against my face, I wondered if this was the work of the Inner Critic. Had it escalated the sensation of shame so strongly, that it turned into a physical reaction?After a while, I came back to my desk. I was shaken. How could I keep writing if I was going to make myself sick? But I knew in my heart that the bankruptcy story was important in my book. During the 1980s recession, I met so many people who were devastated by failing businesses and personal loss. I wanted to help them with my own and others’ experience. How could I do this if I couldn’t get past my own Inner Critic?So I did what I tell my writing students to do:  take a break and do a freewrite—write outside my story.I located my writing notebook under the manuscript pages. I began writing about being literally sick with shame. As I wrote, I got the idea to start a “treaty” letter to this Gatekeeper-as-Inner-Critic, thanking it for its help in keeping me safe all these years. I wrote about how I appreciated its role. I wrote how I understood why it brought caution to my writing life because it had my best interests at heart. With each sentence, I felt a lessening of tension in my gut, a softening in my heart. No longer waged in battle, I was able to see my Inner Critic in a new way.Then I asked it kindly to step aside, to let me write this chapter. I explained why I needed to write it, reassured the Critic that this story didn’t have to end up in the final book. I just needed to get it on paper.When the letter was finished, I closed my notebook and went back to my desk. The chapter flowed out better than I could’ve imagined and the Inner Critic was noticeably calmer the rest of that writing session.My Inner Critic only wanted to protect me from the shame of fame:  people looking at me in a different way because I told about a business failure many years before. By collaborating with this gate-keeping voice, instead of rejecting its help, I was able to proceed.My book, How to Master Change in Your Life, was finally published, and I got more letters and comments about that bankruptcy chapter than any other.My intuition was right—people needed to hear about self-forgiveness for big mistakes. Your Weekly Writing Exercise:  A Letter to the Inner Critic This is an exercise we use in my Part 1 online class, Your Book Starts Here.  Try it yourself.  You'll need about thirty minutes.1.  You're going to be writing a letter to the Inner Critic.  Do this on paper or on the computer--whichever is easier.  To start, describe your Inner Critic.  What does it sound like?  Can you picture it?  Does it remind you of someone in your past?2. Ask the Inner Critic what it’s contributing to your life. Listen inside for anything that might come, even small things it does for you.  How does it keep you safe?How does it keep you connected to others?How does it keep you responsible?How does it make you feel intelligent?How does it bring you respect of peers?3. Thank it for its help in these areas. If more comes to mind as you write, add your gratitude about those.4. Now write a request to the Inner Critic:  ask it to step aside for a week. Tell it you’ll be exploring a new avenue in your writing and you feel you need freedom. Ask for its help in letting you try it.5. Mark on your calendar to follow up in a week.6. After one week, spend five minutes freewriting about any changes you’ve noticed. Are there fewer blocks in your creative process? Is your writing any different? Do you experience less negative self-talk?"},

How do you find time to write?  That's a question I'm asked alot--by other writers, by students in my classes, by attendees at conferences where I give my book-structuring workshops. I've had a prolific writing career, with thirteen books published.  Yet I also have a family that needs attention and a teenager to raise, an elderly parent to care for, a huge garden that both gives me joy and takes a lot of energy, and a passion for painting.How is it possible to do it all, and do everything as well as I'd like?Answer:  I can't.  Nobody can.But I've learned about what I can do.  And it's usually a lot more than I think.  If I can take an honest look at what is outwardly derailing my attempts to be a creative, fulfilled person--and what derailment is coming from inside--I can make time for the writing.First, you need the five fundamentals in place.  Last week, I talked about these five fundamentals for writers.  See that post here.  Once these five are working in your life, even a little, you have a better chance of actually fitting your book into your life.  You must allow yourself to make room for writing, just like you'd make room for your grocery shopping or your kid's homework or your sleep.  If your writing is left to last, it will never fit in.This morning is a great example, for me.  My wonderful spouse and I tag team childcare, and we talk about it ahead of time.  Mornings and evenings are the peak chaos moments, but usually if things are OK, only one of us needs to be \"on duty.\"  While one person keeps the morning moving (waking the sleepy teenager, monitoring the clock, gathering stuff to take, heating up some breakfast), the other is allowed to retreat into creative work.  This morning was my time, and I woke earlier than usual, sat with my writer's notebook and thought about my chapter-in-progress, all before anyone else stirred.  By the time the family was up, I was already at work on the chapter--which is due this week to my writers group.  Around me was the normal morning chaos, but because of my agreement with my family, I was able to keep going, without guilt.This sounds amazing, yes.  But when the writing begins to feed us, when we give it time to do so, it helps everyone around us. Writing posted, I had time to help clean up the kitchen, say goodbye to my teenager, kiss my spouse, and make myself something to eat before my own workday began.I came away really energized.  Yes, it took negotiation--but as a family we are pretty good at it now.  It also took honoring my own time and space to write--despite the frantic nature of school mornings.  But most important, it took me believing in myself--that my writing was as important as everything else that was going on.Radical Thought:  Doing My Writing Practice Heals Me, and Also Everyone around Me I believe that my writing practice heals me, makes me a better person.  I am convinced that when I am creating regularly, my family, my work, and my relationships benefit as well.You probably know by now thatregular writing has been documented for its healing benefits. James Pennebaker, professor at the University of Texas, Austin, and author of Writing to Heal, studied the effects of writing on groups of medical patients. His landmark study showed marked improvements in immune function and general well-being from patients who wrote regularly.Dr. Louise DeSalvo, in Writing as a Way of Healing, narrowed it down. She listed three areas writers must tap into, to benefit the most from writing practice.Three Areas1. How did the person feel then (during the event)?2. How does person feel now, in comparison?3. Which specific, concrete details, especially sensory detail, describe the past event?This morning I was writing about a difficult crisis one of my characters is going through. For the writing to be transformative, it must reveal how the character felt when it happened, as well as afterward, and the comparison of feelings between the two. It must also use sensory detail to describe the past event.To test this theory, I applied it to my character, Molly, after the fight with her father.If you're working on memoir, the \"character\" would be you--and incorporating the three areas would make the writing come together in an amazing way.  For nonfiction writers, the goal is to use these three areas to provide transformation for your reader.  How did the reader feel then, now, and what are the details around the change?  You use these three areas in your anecdotes.In my classes, I ask students to prove this to themselves:  to scan favorite nonfiction books, memoirs, and novels from their bookshelves, ones they reread often and feel transformed by.Here's what they usually tell me:  In every one, the authors showed people who (1) felt things in the present moment, and (2) remembered past feelings via backstory and compared the feelings of present and past, demonstrating change. Well-crafted scenes also used (3) specific sensory details to illustrate those feelings.When I look at my own published books, my best-loved moments also showed these three healing aspects.So I try to include these three transformative areas in my writing practice, as questions to ask about my story. When I can, I find using these healing guidelines increases my joy in my practice of my craft.Writing practice becomes easier as you do more of it. You see how it changes you for the better, how it helps you be happier, how it even keeps you out of trouble. “I create every day,” a painter told me, “because it keeps me happy. I’m less likely to cause problems for myself.” So it is with writing practice.In Women Who Run with the Wolves, Clarissa Pinkola Estés wrote, “It is the love of something, having so much love for something—whether a person, a word, an image, an idea, the land, or humanity—that all that can be done with the overflow is to create. It is not a matter of wanting to, not a singular act of will; one solely must.”A radical thought:  The act of writing can keep you so at peace that you don’t search for problems where there aren’t any.Your Weekly Writing Exercise:  Negotiating a Regular Writing Practice (Time needed: ten minutes a day for three weeks) 1. Find ten minutes a day that you can devote to your book.2. Put your writing time on your calendar. Make it the same time every day.3. Talk with your family, roommates, spouse, or kids. Explain that you’ll be spending fifteen, thirty, ninety, or more minutes a day on your writing. Ask their cooperation:  when you are in your writing space, you are off duty. You can’t be asked questions or talked with.4. Make a sign that says “Writer at Work” and put it near your writing space or on your door.5. For the first week, do freewrites for ten minutes each day. Write about something that stuck with you, something that happened recently. One student wrote about going to a movie that week where the audience was primarily elderly people and how the way they laughed, moved her. Another wrote about taking her son to dinner at a Chinese restaurant where large cylindrical red-and-orange paper lanterns hung along the walls and how the conversation blossomed in this colorful atmosphere.6. Keep these writings in a file on your computer called “Week One.”7. Start a new file called “Week Two.”  Day one of the second week, make a list or freewrite for ten minutes on possible topics for your book—anything you can imagine including. The rest of week two, choose one of these topics each day and write for ten minutes on it.8. The third week, write about a new topic from your list each day but add one observation of something you experienced, saw, felt, or learned that week. See if you can blend the exercises from weeks one and two."},
{"title": "Five Fundamental Practices That Professional Writers Lean On", "date": "Sunday, May 13, 2012", "text": "Navigating a book is sometimes like traveling an unfamiliar pathway through murky waters.  Even though the scenery can be gorgeous--and inspiring--there are many times when the book writer is lost, confused, overwhelmed by all the options.There are certain practices that help smooth the way.  They act like an internal compass for professional writers, who honor them without question.They begin with willingness to ask for space, time, the privacy and solitude needed to do our writing.  How is this working in your life?Creative People Require Creative Withdrawal  Julia Cameron, in her book The Artist’s Way, talks about predictable reactions artists get as they begin to request time for their art.  “Such time, space, and quiet will strike our family as a withdrawal from them. It is.” She explains that if we don’t honor our need for the private time and space to create freely, we begin to die a slow death. Often we don’t recognize this is happening. Or we may shrug it off—What can a busy person do?  Of course, family, job, life responsibilities cannot be ignored. But there’s a place for creativity too.Virginia Woolf wrote an entire book about the basic human need to be creative and have your own space to do so. Reading A Room of One’s Own spurred me on during my first few books. I learned that not having time and space to write is an excruciating experience, as not only did my book abandon me, but I abandoned myself. Whenever I compromised my need to have privacy and writing time in a busy life, I soon lost the threads of my creative ideas. But worse, I began to feel discouraged, so much so that I doubted I was ever creative at all. Re-establishing a writing practice again slowly helped me regain confidence in myself and joy in my creative life.Writer David Ogilvy, author of Confessions of an Advertising Man, joked that he’s developed certain ways of keep¬ing open “the telephone line” to his unconscious, in case that “disorderly repository” has anything to say. Poet and essayist Lewis Hyde speaks of the invocation that’s an essential part of any artist’s life. “Part of the work cannot be made,” he says, “it must be received.”But receiving requires taking a stand against the demands of our lives. And this conflicts with our desire to be good people, contributors to society, supportive of our family, to say nothing of showing up for our job. “We want to be generous, of service to the world,” Julia Cameron says. “But what we really want is to be left alone. When we can’t get others to leave us alone, we eventually abandon ourselves. To others, we may look like we’re there. We may act like we’re there. But our true self has gone to ground.”Practicing art is a constant balancing act. How much time and energy you can devote to your book depends on your life responsibilities. Be realistic, but also realize that saboteurs come not only from without. They also come from within ourselves.One way to keep a balance is to start small and negoti¬ate each stage. If you tell yourself you’ll write three hours each morning and know full well that life usually prevents that, it sets you up for failure. There is no benefit with man¬aging two days then giving up.Build your writing practice gradually. Start with ten minutes a day for two weeks, the same time each day if possi¬ble. See if you can maintain this, get used to the new rhythm, grow confidence in your own trustworthiness and your own commitment.What Are the Five Fundamental Practices?So it isn’t talent that makes an artist succeed. Talented people fail all the time.Success comes from practicing these fundamentals.  It also demands belief in yourself, persistence with your craft, within this good routine—setting aside regular, sacred time to make art.To dedicate time, you must believe in your worth.  As the painter and author Frederick Franck wrote in The Awakened Eye, “You shall not wait for inspiration, for it comes not while you wait, but while you work.” You must believe your art is important and deserves your attention. So must your family and friends. I’ve found five ingredients that make a book writer’s practice successful.If all five are in place, they will support and sustain the long journey.1. Find and honor your best time to write.2. Keep writing equipment private, secure, and in good working order.3. Have a dedicated writing space.4. Have a set time to write.5. Close the door to the world when you are writing.Use this week to upgrade your practices.  Be honest--assess how you're doing in each area.  If you are stuck, it might not be your determination or your material.  It might be your practices.  Your Weekly Writing Exercise:  Practicing the Five Fundamentals1.  Study each of these five practices.2.  Honestly assess:  Which are in place in your life?  Which could be strengthened?3.  Take one small step this week to create more support for your writing within one of these fundamental practices."},
{"title": "Imagination and Being Stuck--New Brain Facts for Writers", "date": "Friday, May 4, 2012", "text": "The topic of creativity and brain science has exploded in the past few years.  There was Daniel Pink's amazing book, A Whole New Mind, which explored how we're becoming more right-brain able and how it's causing creativity to blossom in our culture.  This week I've been reading another wonderful new book--Imagine by Jonah Lehrer.  Lehrer brought us Proust Was a Neuroscientist, an easy-to-understand exploration of senses and how we access them as creative artists.The opening section of Imagine talks about Bob Dylan.  How Dylan was on tour in the early stages of his career and hated it so much, he told his fans he was giving up music.  He felt his songs were meaningless, that they no longer thrilled him in any way.  He didn't like who he had become.He ended the tour and got on his motorcycle, and he rode to his cabin in Woodstock, New York, intending to hole up and do something completely unrelated to writing songs.One day, Lehrer recounts, Dylan felt a sort of buzz inside, the first tingles of imagination stirring again, new ideas coming through.  Because he wasn't trying, because he'd given up the \"right way\" to write songs, the lyrics and melody of \"Like a Rolling Stone\" began pouring through.  You may know that this particular song changed the face of rock 'n' roll;even Bruce Springsteen and John Lennon were influenced by it.  It broke all the rules back then, and introduced us to a new era.Why did it happen?  Because Dylan got stuck. Because he got sick and tired of how he was doing things and decided to stop.  Lehrer says Dylan's imagination was then free to engage in a completely new way.  This seems to be a key component of breakthroughs, creatively.We need to get stuck, first, Lehrer proposes.  Before the imagination can take new pathways, we may need to really feel we're going nowhere.  Julia Cameron also talks a lot about this, in her well-loved guide to creativity, The Artist's Way.  As I understand it, Cameron originally wrote it for creative artists who were stuck, who were not doing their art anymore.  The idea was to actually acknowledge the stuckness, to almost embrace it (morning pages), then begin to give yourself creative alternatives.  Try new things, let go of how we \"should\" be doing it.  Only then can the imagination stir, buzz inside us, give us those ideas that might lead to a breakthrough.  Cameron very gently assigned readers a weekly artist date:  to spend an hour exploring something completely unknown.I teach online book-writing classes and week-long book-writing retreats.  In both of these courses, there's the keen possibility of getting stuck.  I watch many writers reach this place, and although they despair, I am quietly celebrating.  It doesn't mean I am a nasty person who likes to watch people suffer.  I just delight in the knowledge that this \"stuck\" writer is about to breakthrough to a new level, because I deeply believe that getting stuck--even for an hour--is a prerequisite to that letting go that allows the breakthrough to happen. It's obvious that many writers give up when they are stuck, rather than exploring how to fill up the creative well, as Cameron recommends.  The Inner Critic gets excited, shuts the creative gate, and that's that for the book project sometimes.  I hope more writers allow their support networks to coach them through this stage, past the discomfort, and encourage them to explore something new.Remember this formula is exactly how the imagination gets sparked.  Odd, isn't it?  Creativity is only partly the ability to be disciplined and responsible to the Muse, to sit ourselves in the chair and write.  It's also about keeping the imagination ever seeking the new and different to spark from.Interesting that brain studies are finding out the same thing:  the brain doesn't court imaginative breakthroughs as often if it's plodding down the same road, taking things in sequence.  Discipline is great, but it alone won't make you a great writer.  So the point is to let yourself daydream, go out of focus.  How do you incorporate this kind of activity into your writing life, especially when you are working hard on a book project?Your Weekly Writing Exercise1.  This week, put aside your project and go exploring.  Do something completely unrelated and allow yourself to become saturated by color, image, sounds, smells.  Spring is a great time for this--in our neck of the woods, the lilacs are in full bloom and the air is scented with heaven.  Go outside, barefoot if possible, and repair your nature deficient.  2.  Get a copy of Lehrer's book, Imagine, and enjoy learning more about the brain and creativity."},
{"title": "Making Lists:  A Way to Find Land When You Feel out to Sea with Your Manuscript", "date": "Monday, April 30, 2012", "text": "Many writers in my online book-writing classes get to the point where living with their manuscript is like living with a chaotic child.  There are pages and pages, all over the place.  A storyboard keeps the overview, to some extent, but as the editing and revision get on, the book gets overwhelming.  It's hard to keep track of where you are, because the landmarks are all changing so fast.This happened to me lately too.  I'm in revision with my next novel, and my wonderful writing group gave me some big suggestions this week.  Core changes for one of the main characters.  A lightening up of the downslide--\"give them some good times too.\"  Maybe even a setting changed or gotten rid of.  Whew!  I really agreed with them--good suggestions like these help you see how to take your book to the next step.  But over the following days, I found myself avoiding anything to do with writing.  It all just seemed too much.How to Get Out of the OverwhelmAt the same time, a writer from Texas wrote me about this very dilemma:\"I've been struggling for the last couple of months to get traction,\" she said,\"because so much of my book is changing and I'm becoming overwhelmed quickly.It's hard to know where to start, and then when I do start and hit a bump, hardto keep going. It feels like a maze. \"One thing that is not helping is that I have notes and bits and pieceseverywhere, and inspirations that I've written down are being lost. So I know Ineed to do something about that. When I start to pull them together, I tend togo wandering again... I know it's a personal thing but just wondered if you hadany tips on systems. Actually, I know this is in your book (Your Book Starts Here), Mary. I'll go backto it this morning. :) \"I was also thinking about not knowing when pathsare blind alleys or dead ends. Once you've done enough writing on your projectto know that they exist, and you have all those little darlings hanging out todry and cure, the Inner Critic has something solid to hook his claws into, that this nextpath you're on could be another dead end.\"Do you have any thoughts and tips on organizingthings with where you are with your story?What approaches are you using? Ato-do list?\"Yes.  That's exactly where I am headed.  Lists are lifesavers at the overwhelm stage of revision.Three Kinds of ListsI make three kinds of lists during this stage.  Some have been ongoing since the earlier drafts and some are new.  Each acts as a mini-map out of the maze of pages.  Each helps me orient and find that precious overview again.They are:1.  Questions List2.  Location List 3.  Character List  (River of Life)Questions ListFirst and most important is the Questions List.  This revision-stage list is basically a to-do list but made up of questions.  I find that tasks are well and good, but I can get equally overwhelmed by another list of tasks.  So I trick myself into a sense of exploring and creativity by turning the to-do's into questions.I get a pad of paper and all the feedback and ideas I've accumulated thus far (printing them out is very helpful).  I don't refer to the manuscript during this exercise--it'll just bring back the overwhelm.  On the top of the pad, I write \"Questions List.\"  I begin with anything I've been mulling about, based on feedback or my own ideas.  I list these as questions.For instance, rather than \"give Mel a fun scene in Act 2\" I would rework this as \"What could Mel do in Act 2 that would be fun for him?\"  Questions get the creative brain juiced up and working.  To-do's make us feel burdened with tasks--and tasks are driven by discipline, which is part of the overwhelm (we're tired!!).Once I have my Questions List started, I stop writing, get up, and do something completely unrelated to my book or my writing for an hour or so--fill the creative well.  The goal is to distract the linear self and allow the right brain to engage and the creative self to get cooking.  Tasks that help might include paging through a magazine and tearing out photos for collage, meditation or yoga, gardening, making food, reading a book in your book's genre, listening to music, taking a walk.  Gradually, as you disengage from the pressure, the ideas will start flowing.  I find that sometimes I'll get a new map, a sudden idea, a solution to a problem. If there's a desire to keep writing, then do it via a mind-map or cluster technique--where the question is put in the center of a blank sheet of paper in a circle and spokes come off of it with related ideas.Location ListThe second list that helps me during this stage is the Location List.  This exercise requires the manuscript.  I write down EVERY location in the book.  Every single one.  Usually this exercise takes only an hour or so--skimming the manuscript is pretty fast--and I come up with an astonishing list of all the places where I expect my readers to follow the story.  Here the kicker:  I try to reduce this to seven locations.  Even fewer is better.  Locations that are meaningful are like characters or people in a book--we can only get to know a certain number.So I circle the ones that are most important to me/the story.  What can I eliminate?  What might deliver the same meaning as another location and be less redundant?  Getting rid of excess locations is like closet cleaning--it makes the story simpler and less overwhelming.  It brings air and light into the stuffy places. I've found this exercise very effective in helping me move ahead.Character List (River of Life)The final list is the Character List.  It's also called the River of Life.  You can use this for any key players in your book--no matter the genre.Take a pad of paper and write the name of each main player in your book, allowing one sheet of paper per character.  Include yourself, if you are writing a memoir.  Begin listing the main events for that person, which are in your book or will be.  Write as quickly as you can.  Try to get 25 events for each person--this is an indicator that they are developed in your mind and preferably on the page.When you run out of ideas, go to the next page and the next player.Read your lists and highlight or underline the five most important events for each person.  Next to the event, write down how it changed the person.  What did they do or think or feel or believe differently because of that event?  Again, this is a way to check the relevance of your events--if the character didn't experience growth, then there's a good chance the event is not outwardly dramatic enough to feature in your book.See if you have at least five events that are pivots for each character.  If you don't have enough, it points to why you may be overwhelmed--there are not enough \"turning points\" in this character's River of Life to build a book out of.  If you have a lot more than five, it also points to overwhelm--there's too much happening and not enough time in the book to process the changes.Finally, if you wish, draw a river on a piece of paper (I have these as charts in my writing room--I use them for the entire book journey).  Place each player's key events on the river.  Note where they are in relation to each other.  This can help you with weaving multiple timelines and people's stories. This Week's Writing Exercise1.  Pick one of the three lists and try it. 2.  Post your questions and results here--or share them with your writing friends. 3.  If you're interested in working with these kinds of organization techniques with me, online, my next class for book structuring begins the week of May 14.  Check it out here."},
{"title": "Stepping-Stones to Publishing:  The Pros and Cons of Self-Publishing", "date": "Friday, April 13, 2012", "text": "My long career as a writer has taken me through the three different types of publishing:  agented manuscripts published by large houses, unagented manuscripts published by small presses, and self-publishing.  I've learned a lot from each venue.  I enjoyed working with my agents, I liked the book tours and promotional backing that used to be automatic with publishing with a major publisher.  I enjoyed the editorial help from small presses and the feeling that you were more than a byline.  And I loved the autonomy and product control that comes with self-publishing.Each avenue has its pros and cons.  These days, I find that self-publishing is often the best option for writers working on their first book.The media is coming out with many success stories about self-publishing.  One of the biggest stars is Amanda Hocking (read about her here) who sold so many of her self-published e-book, she was picked up by a major house and got herself a six-figure advance.  But Amanda had already made her millions under her own steam.  She knew how to write something good, and market it.  That seems to be the formula no matter which avenue you choose.It used to be that writers only had to be good writers.  Write a good book and the publisher would do the rest.  Now, publishers want to know how you are going to market your own work--whether you have a platform, if you're prepared to broadcast your book on social media like Facebook and Twitter and Tumblr.  Which is one of the reasons I'm so sold on self-publishing--I do all the work of selling my book anyway, so why not keep control of the product and make the most money for my creative efforts?USA Today ran an interesting article on self-publishing e-books recently.  It's no longer the province of authors who can't get a contract.  The stigma that's always surrounded self-publishing (formerly known as vanity press) is dissolving.What Do You Need to Know about Self-Publishing?Lisa, a reader who is working on a book project, sent me an email with some good questions about the self-publishing options she'd explored.  She wants to make a good decision and there are many options out there now.  Lisa writes:  Until I was twenty-two years old I never consciously considered that I had been without a mother, even though my birth mother died shortly before my third birthday. My dad had remarried before I was five and I only remember my stepmother as my mother. However, I believe I was always searching for something, whether I knew it or not. As I became acutely aware of the fact that what I was missing and searching for was her, I began gathering as many stories, pictures, and information I possibly could. People have been very generous. My original goal was to create a biography so that not only myself, but also my children could come to know who she was. It has been a magnificent journey, but it did not turn out as I had envisioned. The whole experience has been more of an odyssey worthy of Greek mythology as I set out on a quest for knowledge but was subsequently sent on many unexpected detours, presenting challenges through which I learned more about myself as well as valuable life lessons. As a result, my project has become a memoir of my journey through the experience, with the addition of many photos and a collection of my favorite stories shared by her family and friends.My main goal is to have enough copies printed for my children and my mother’s family, but so many people have encouraged me to share my story on a larger scale than I originally intended. I believe that self-publishing is the way to go. I have researched online, and have also spoken to about 5 self-publishing companies. They all have stated that they believe that they can handle the amount photos that I wish to incorporate and that “we would be a good match.” I am wary of being taken advantage of and want to make an educated decision. Each has their positives and negatives in the categories of cost, features such as editing, layout, cover design, and the royalty offers.Lisa lists these questions: 1.  How can you tell if an offer is a good deal and actually fits your publishing needs? 2.  What are the top three qualities to keep in mind when choosing a publisher? 3.  What are the biggest pitfalls a novice should avoid? 4.  Is one royalty structure better than another, i.e., more money up front, but better royalty structure, or less up front and then less in royalties later? 5.  How important is help with layout and book cover design?Specific Questions for Your PublisherWhen you're looking at possible online publishers for your manuscript, you need to consider several aspects:  quality of product, cost, and ease of working with the publisher.  You need to research how they pay you when copies are sold (the royalty agreement), how the rights are handled, and whether the publisher automatically places your book in the two large wholesalers--Ingram (for bookstores) and Baker & Taylor (for libraries).  Over 60 percent of books are purchased online, so you'll also need to be sure your book will appear in the large online bookstores, such as amazon.com and barnesandnoble.com, and the indie distributors such as Powells Books (powells.com).  When I began researching publishers, I first asked friends who have self-published.  The best recommendations were for three companies:  LightningSource (which is owned by the wholesale distributor, Ingram); CreateSpace (which is owned by amazon.com); and iUniverse.  I also talked with writers who had published with Lulu.com and loved their customer service but not the quality as much (one person said the cover peeled off her printed book after a few months).Then I went on the websites for each of these three and looked at the terms.  I liked CreateSpace because of the ease of getting paid each month.  It's also important to read the contract terms for specifics like who will hold the copyright for your book.  This is very important in the long run.After I'd chosen a potential publisher, the next step was to put my book manuscript through the tasks that a regular publisher would normally take care of:  professional editing, typesetting and interior design, and cover design.  I needed to prepare my manuscript.  Preparing Your ManuscriptMany self-publishing companies offer a package deal for the manuscript preparation, but I wanted to work with people I knew and trusted.  I'd been an editor myself for over thirty years and I had very high standards.So I approached a former student who'd worked for a major publisher for many years; I liked her thoughtful understanding of how books were built and the importance of editing carefully.She agreed to take on my manuscript.  Was I ever glad!  She saw things I'd missed and suggested rearrangement of some of the chapters.  We worked by email and postal mail, me sending her chapters in batches, she returning them to me with her red pencil marks.  It took many months to implement all her suggestions and produce a final revision that I was very satisfied with, time I hadn't really budgeted, but I revised my timeline and it was worth it, 100 percent.Next was the interior design.  Because I've worked in publishing for years, I know that, despite good  skills with desktop publishing, I could never churn out a book design on my own  computer that I would still love in ten years.  I remembered a wonderful typesetter I'd worked with years before at one of the publishing companies where I was an editor.  I knew she'd gone freelance, so I approached her and asked her to typeset a sample chapter for me.We worked for a few weeks by email to make the chapter closer to what I envisioned.  Eventually, I was so satisfied with the results, I negotiated a contract for her to typeset the entire book interior.  She made the book look professional, and I was able to add in wider margins and pull quotes, exercise boxes, and other extras I wanted.  Again, very worthwhile.I traded services with two proofreaders to make one more run through the manuscript after typesetting.  They found a total of 32 errors which I hadn't seen--even thought I'd read it through carefully SO many times myself and I've been trained in proofreading.  This step was also very valuable to me.Finally, the book cover.  I knew how important this was, so I found a designer and hired them to send me some ideas.  Again, money forked over up front but oh-so-worthwhile.You can certainly choose not to do any of these steps.  They may not be essential if you are only planning on using your book to share family memories with family members.  But each of these will make your book more professional, more apt to be read by others, and more satisfying ten years later when you pick it up again to read yourself.Royalty Structures and Self-PublishingTraditional publishers used to (and some still do) offer an \"advance\" on royalties.  This was paid to the author before the book was published, then paid back as sales came in and royalties accumulated.  Royalties are the quarterly or semi-annual payments that publishers make to the author based on a percentage of sales, and standard royalties are 7.5% of sales. Sometimes this is net, sometimes it's gross sales.  The publisher also holds back an amount of royalties for bookstore returns and discounts to the wholesalers, so it's very hard to actually calculate how much you'll be getting.  For more information, click on this helpful website.In self-publishing, things are simpler.  You pay a flat fee to have your book \"set up\" for printing; this is part of your upfront costs so the printer can format your pdf into a digital file to print your book.  Most charge under $300 for this set up.  That's it.  (Remember that some self-publishing companies offer a package that includes the editing, typesetting, etc., above, but the set-up fee is not part of that.)  Next, you get a proof--a sample, usually in pdf format, that shows you how the book will look.  Once you approve that, a couple of weeks go by and then people can start buying your book as an e-book or as a printed book.When do you get paid?  Each time a sale is made, your royalty account gets a deposit.  Most self-publishing companies pay out royalties each month--a process I found very helpful, like getting a paycheck--but this can vary so check their websites carefully.  You can choose to receive your royalty directly into your bank account or by check.How much do you make for self-publishing royalties, compared to traditional publishing?  I've found it's about 5-6 times as much per book.  The online publisher takes a percentage, but it's a lot less than a regular publisher takes.  For instance, I make about $1.13 per copy of my novel (published by a small press) and about $5.49 per copy of one of my nonfiction books (self-published by CreateSpace).  In both cases, I have had to market the book myself.  Do the math. Even with the upfront costs of getting my manuscript prepared, I've made more with my most recent self-published book than with my last traditionally published book.  Plus, I got to keep control of the product.All the avenues of publishing are worth pursuing, and which is the best one for you depends on what you want from the experience.  As Amanda Hocking has shown us all, fame and fortune do not just come from traditional publishing anymore.  Your Weekly Writing Exercise1.  If you're curious about self-publishing, give yourself an hour to do some research online.  Visit the main sites for CreateSpace, Lightning Source, and iUniverse, to start.  Maybe check out Lulu.2.  Also visit some of the hybrid publishers, which select certain books to self-publish each year and guide writers through the process.  Two I like are Beaver Pond Press and Epigraph."},
{"title": "How Do You Finally Get Your Book Finished (and Published)?  Passion and Determination--An Interview with New Author, Atina Diffley", "date": "Friday, March 30, 2012", "text": "Atina Diffley, an organic vegetable farmer in her former life, is now an  organic consultant, author, and public speaker. Her just released  memoir, Turn Here Sweet Corn: Organic Farming Works, is called \"a must read love  story, a lesson in entrepreneurship, a master class in organic farming,  and a legal thriller.\"Atina showed up at one of my writing workshops at the Loft Literary Center in Minneapolis a few years back. She had a book in mind.  She was passionate about the topic, and--from her determination to make others passionate about it too--I could tell she would be successful at writing her book.  Although she'd written quite a bit, she needed help structuring and developing the material.  As an experienced organic farmer, she wanted to share what she knew, but in memoir form.  Her life, and her farming, were and are very intertwined.From that first workshop, Atina got fired up.  She liked what she learned about book structuring.  And over the next year or so, I saw her again in a workshop, then another.  She began bringing along her writing friends to learn about structuring their books.Flash forward to last Friday, when I was back in Minneapolis teaching at the Loft Literary Center.  It was the same two-day book-structuring workshop that Atina had first attended.  She wasn't there.  But two of her  friends were.Before class began, they handed me a book.  Atina's just-published book:  Turn Here Sweet Corn.  University of Minnesota press had accepted it, and they'd done a great job publishing it.  On the back cover were strong endorsements, and I've heard since the class that Atina is getting good reviews and interviews.  As an author, she's launched.I felt very privileged to share in her writing journey, from early days of crafting her manuscript to finally glory.  This happens fairly often in my classes, I'm happy to say.  One of my favorite moments is when a former student stops by and hands me their published book or sends me a copy by mail.  I'm so happy to celebrate with them.So I asked Atina to share her writing journey, from seed to sprout to published memoir.  What did she learn along the way that might help other writers who are dreaming of a book?When did you begin writing this book--and why was it so important to you to write?I thought about writing a book for over a decade, but I’m glad I waited, as crucial parts of the story hadn’t been lived yet. It became a priority for me in November 2009. There are so many reasons I wrote Turn Here Sweet Corn. To pass on the support and guidance I have received to other women and farmers, for personal healing for my family and myself, to bring more people into the conversation on food and farming, but the most powerful—the subconscious driving force that kept me on task—was the ecological collapse I experienced in the development of our first farm.This was burning to be shared. Any obstacles you encountered along the way?Mostly myself. I had everything—all the support and teachers I needed. Sometimes self-doubt would interfere. I had to learn to trust.What was the biggest turning point in your writing process?Two weeks in, I wasn’t accomplishing much at home so I went off alone to write for two weeks. I didn’t really know what the book was about beyond being a memoir based on my farming experience. I started to write and it was like my life was on a Rolodex card file and each card contained one moment. I couldn’t figure out which belonged in the book. Painful memories piled up and became emotionally exhausting. The thought of publishing made me feel completely exposed and vulnerable. The card file spun faster and faster, and I became so overwhelmed that my body developed bursitis of the right shoulder. I was in excruciating pain, close to vomiting and passing out. I spent the next week doing nothing but emotional work and by the end of the week the bursitis was cleared and I was one determined and committed writer. I later learned in a writing class that the body sometimes acts as a “gatekeeper” to prevent a writer from going into areas that are emotionally painful. What would you do differently, based on what you know now about book writing?I LOVE the island method I learned in Mary’s class \"How to Plan, Write, and Develop a Book.\" It solved my problem of not knowing what the book was about. Once I learned to trust the process and my subconscious to bring forward the needed storie,s the islands literally poured out of me. I couldn’t write them fast enough. Next book I’ll start right in on writing islands.Any advice to first-time book writers?Believing in ourselves is the most powerful thing we can do. When I sit down to write, I thank my inner critic—her name is Sylvia—for all she’s done, and I assign her the role she has in my present work. (I learned this from Mary Carroll Moore in a class at the Loft Literary Center.) During freewrites Sylvia is sent on vacation. While line editing she is appointed the responsibility of “specific” and “constructive” feedback. If she’s having a bad day and insists on self-defeating criticism, or her ego is raging out of control offering talk shows with Oprah, I send her packing.How did you land your publishing contract?Every writer’s dream! Turn Here had a fairy godmother, food writer Beth Dooley, who not only mentored me during the writing, she also connected me to her acquisitions editor, who just happened to be a freezing-corn and canning-tomato customer of ours from twenty years ago. I never even wrote a query letter.The University of Minnesota Press was fantastic to work with and many of the staff had eaten our produce over the years so they had a personal connection. May the stars align again for my next book!What's it feel like to have your book out there? The thing I felt most vulnerable about--not having any control over the reader’s relationship with Turn Here or their interpretation of my writing--has turned out to be the greatest experience! Readers are telling me how the book is affecting them and of parallels in their own life. I am receiving stories of their own loss and grief, and celebration, in connection with land and nature.Their relationship with the book has brought me deeper understanding of the inner story of Turn Here and of my own life! What's the reader response so far?Readers are loving it, and it is meeting my goal of a compelling read for people from all walks of life! But there may be some liability issues. The story is so engaging that readers are reporting irresponsible behavior. One person turned a kettle on high, started reading, and forgot until hours later when smoke was pouring out of the kitchen, another reported forgetting to pick his kids up from daycare, there have been marital disputes about who gets to read, and one reader laughed so hard, and for so long, that she couldn’t drive and was late for work.How has writing your book affected your life?I’ve heard that writing is cathartic, but writing Turn Here has transformed me! It gave me the structure to completely reevaluate my life experiences and what they mean. In the process I learned that bad things happen but me, I’m fine, in fact I’ve thrived. Anything else you'd like to share with others who are writing a book?The world needs your story. Trust yourself and the process. Make a commitment and let the writing happen.

{"title": "The Timeline of a Book Project--How Long It Can Take, What to Do at Each Stage", "date": "Sunday, March 25, 2012", "text": "D.W., a reader from the West Coast, emailed me this week with some great questions about the timeline of a book project and how a writer can best assess her needs for feedback at any stage.  D.W. just read my new book, Your Book Starts Here, and  is working on her first manuscript.  \"Thank you for  your wonderful book on getting published,\" she wrote. \"It has been the biggest help.   But I have a couple of questions.\"  And she listed them:1.  At what point do I spend the money for a professional editor?2.  Does one wait until they find an agent and let the agent guide them or should it be done before the agent sees the work?3.  When does one get their work copyrighted? Is that part of the work an agent helps with also?D.W. is right to ask these questions.  Books have particular timelines, and they need different things to help them grow at different stages.For many years--and the last eight books I've published--I've worked with a successful timeline for building a manuscript and moving into the editing, then the submission process.  Of course, it varies with each new book, because books, like babies, have their own plans.  Some take a lot longer than you expect; others are very fast because you've done so much of the \"gestating\" before you put fingers to keyboard.Writers know that a lot of book writing happens solo.  You, your words, the dream worlds you're occupying, are not shared with others in the beginning.  No editors are involved because there's not a lot to edit yet.  This is as it should be.  You're gestating something very fragile, easily destroyed by other eyes.  I love the support of other writers and creative artists, including professional editors, during the writing journey, but if I share my work too early, their voices blend too easily with my own and confuse me.I need time to listen to my own thoughts, let my own ideas emerge.Unlike other creative artists who give themselves  this important time to explore and \"birth\" their idea before sharing it with the world, lots of book writers have  publishing in mind immediately.   I know very few new artists who paint with the goal of a gallery, few beginning musicians who are composing for that recording contract.  But writers tend to be motivated by the starry dream of seeing their name on the cover  of a published book.  Or by the hopeful royalties that will let them  quit their day job.Give yourself the dream time, first.  Books aren't that different from paintings or a  musical composition or a dance--there needs to be open, goal-less space in your timeline.  Space for just writing, for exploring your book idea, before you imagine an audience.Truthfully, you must enjoy a dedicated one-to-one conversation with your book, before you are able to produce a publishable manuscript.The  essence of your book, the story only you can tell, comes from the  unstructured part of the creative self.  This part loves the dream time of incubation.  Go into it and live in it for a while.  You'll gradually get a sense of what your book is really about.  Its voice is unique to you; you must have time and interior space to find it.That the first successful step on the timeline:  to have a chance to explore.  A sabbatical  from the goal of publishing it.  For this stage, I advocate the \"island writing\"  method promoted by writers like Ken Atchity and Natalie Goldberg, where  you allow yourself to scribe a collection of random scenes or ideas,  then begin to structure them.  You allow yourself to be in the \"process\"  of writing your story, exploring it and getting deeper into your  material.Moving into Conversation with the Reader But at some point, you do need to think of the book as a  \"product\" as well as a way for you to personally explore ideas and  images.  At this second stage, welcoming the reader into the conversation is essential.This is where we begin to work with structure.  The book moves out of the dreamy place forever--and we structure the islands so that the  reader can actually understand the dream too.  I find we cycle back and forth between these two stages--dreamtime and structuring--as we create  the manuscript.  For instance, we may run into an obstacle or a big question--and we're not sure how to proceed.  So, it often helps to return to the  exploration of the material, do some research or create a collage--a  wonderful exploration tool used by many professional writers--to see  which direction is best. This two-part experience  takes however long it takes.  I always advise getting a lot written  before structuring, then pull the bits and pieces (islands) together  into a rough draft before editing too much.When It's Time for Editing Help With my first books I didn't worry about when to bring in an  editor.  I didn't need to hire one, because back then (the 1980s) publishers had  in-house editors.  Part of my book contract was assistance from an editor.  They were trained to help me see the forest instead of just the trees, the whole book instead of just my individual words.This doesn't happen as often anymore, except at some small presses.  Agents can help a writer with editing, but rarely the early stages of editing--only the final polish.  So it's up to writers to decide when their manuscript is holding together well enough to warrant an outside editor.I encourage writers first to learn some editing skills and try to edit their own material.  How do you do this?  Take writing and editing classes.  Learn the areas you need better skills--characters, for instance, or dialogue or balancing your information with enough illustration (anecdotes) if you're writing nonfiction.  Study good books to see how those writers did it.  Read (a lot!) in your genre.When I've polished as best I can, I work with my writing partner, my writers' group, to see what else needs attention.  I learn my blind spots as a writer.  Many things I'll be able to fix myself if I can see them.  Then, when I've done all I can, I find a professional editor for hire, someone who is not familiar with my every word and can give me a clear perspective that peer reviewers can't.  I work with a professional editor for each book I publish.Again, writers ask:  Don't agents give this kind of help?  Some do.  But only after the manuscript is very clean (well edited) or the subject matter is so compelling or the writer is so famous or well-connected, it's worth the agent's time to dive in.  Most agents I've known will not take on a manuscript that hasn't been through editing.  And usually, you only get one chance with an agent, so it's best to take care of the editing yourself, before you approach an agent. Before Submitting--Do You Need to Copyright Your Manuscript? Some writers feel it's important to register their unpublished manuscripts with the U.S. Copyright Office (click here to find out more).  For me, in all my years in publishing, I've found that few people steal other writer's works.  Of course, there are exceptions, but the reality is that publishing is a very small world, especially with the internet.I've been happy to just add a copyright notice on my works that go out to readers either electronically or in print, just by writing (c) [year] [my name] and All rights reserved on the bottom page of the story, article, essay, column, or manuscript.  This serves as a warning and has protected me well without the hassle of registering the work officially.Publishers take care of this process, as well as getting the book its ISBN, etc., and if you self-publish, you'll be guided by the online printer as to the steps to register yourself. These are the different stages in my book writing timeline.  Be comfortable at the stage you're in now, give it the time it deserves before moving too fast to the next.  Your book will benefit.   Your Weekly Writing Exercise1.  Brainstorm on paper a possible timeline for your book project.  Ask questions like:*  Where am I now in the process, based on what I just read?*  With my work, family, and other obligations, how much time can I devote to my book each week?*  Where would I like to be with my book in a year? *  What editing skills can I learn in the meantime?  What is missing in my editing toolbox?"},
{"title": "How a Writing Partner--or a Writers' Group--Can Help You Finish Your Book", "date": "Monday, March 19, 2012", "text": "Finding a writing partner is like finding gold.  A solo journey to writing a book--or just making time for regular writing practice--can be hard.  I've worked with a writing partner for many years, and we meet monthly by phone to report on our writing progress and set goals for the month.  My writing partner holds me accountable and gives me encouragement when I feel blue about my creativity.  I found my writing partner via a writers' group that disbanded; she and I stayed in contact and decided to start our partnership.  It's morphed over the years as our writing needs have changed.  We're both working on books, and we both believe our partnership has helped us keep going.Lynn and Carole are two blog readers who live in the Midwest.  They are writing partners.  After my book, Your Book Starts Here, was published, Lynn asked if it could be used as a weekly study guide for writing partners or book study groups. Of course! I said.  Over the year since my book was released, Lynn has updated me on their progress.  They have been steady about using the book to help their writing partnership (and their writing!) grow.  Such a support team is inspiring--and I thought you might like knowing how to put one together for yourself.  I asked them a few questions about their writing partnership. How long have you been writing?  Are either of you working on a book--and what kind?Lynn:  I have been writing (letters) since grade school and dabbled around with stories in my early thirties.  In 1993 I attended a seminar/writing conference in Minnesota where I started taking writing more seriously.Coincidentally I met Carole at this seminar and we realized we both lived in St. Louis. Carole’s been dreaming up stories for years. She started writing in junior high school when a teacher inspired her with creative writing assignments. When Carole recently moved out of state, we wanted to keep checking in with one another. So when Your Book Starts Here came out, we both knew we’d want to use it for the stories we were working on--and for future stories.How long have you been writing partners, and how often do you meet?We started helping each other with writing a long time ago, but we began working together with your book in July 2011. We check in with one another on a weekly basis. We decided to work together on a chapter each month in Your Book Starts Here. We stay flexible; sometimes we need to spend more time on a chapter, so we will. Or if we get through a chapter sooner, that’s fine too. Of if something comes up on either of our ends and we can’t finish, we don’t punish ourselves!How has your writing changed from using a writing book as a study guide?Having  a book on writing to follow is a great tool.I’m not structured at all when it  comes to writing a story. I can’t do outlines, etc., but Your Book Starts Here helped me see that it’s not as scary as I thought. Carole is all about structure and outlining, so freewriting  and \"island\" writing in Your Book Starts Here was a new approach for her. We  have different  writing styles and have been able to help each other in that way.When you try the writing exercises, do you have favorites--ones that have helped your writing the most?A hard question!  We are only on Chapter 10, so we haven’t gotten through them all yet.Lynn liked Chapter 4, p. 53,  \"Letter to Inner Critic\" – since she struggles with the Inner Critic and since she love to write letters.  She says she needs to do it more often! Carole liked this exercise too, not realizing how powerful the Inner Critic was and how inhibiting.Lynn also liked p. 25 \"Following the Unexpected\" and p. 78 \"My Life and My Writing,\" which asks you to list the minimum requirements to keep a writing practice going in your life.Lynn:  I started using this book with a completed rough-draft manuscript in hand. I thought I could skip ahead and figure out what I needed to do to make it better. When I read a chapter where I thought I could start at, I realized I needed to go back to the chapter before. Once I got to that chapter, I again had to go back to the previous chapter.It finally became evident that I needed to start right from the beginning. This has been a bit of a challenge—applying things to an already written story… like Chapter 10 which focuses on working with Acts 1, 2 and 3.I had a hard time figuring out where those were in my story. But with Carole’s help and talking through it, I started to understand and then could see more clearly where the different acts were in the story.  Having a writing partner to work with has made all the difference!Anything you'd recommend to other writers who want to get support for their writing, or use Your Book Starts Here as a study guide?Lynn:  I’d imagine you could use this book on your own if you wanted, but I think it’s really helpful to have at least one other person you can work with because you can bounce things off one another—especially if you’re styles of writing are different like Carole and mine.What works for me sometimes doesn’t work for Carole, but when we talk through the process she can see how it could work for her, and vice versa.Also by going through the book with someone, it holds you accountable.As a writer—especially a new one—you can easily get discouraged or distracted and put it away if you don’t get it. By working with someone, there’s less chance of giving up—it’s like you’re encouragement and inspiration for one another—just like the book.It may take us a while to get through Your Book Starts Here, but I think having it as a guide will help it along faster than trying to write the book alone, and will ensure that it will get finished. When I’m finished with all my “in progress” manuscripts, I’ll be excited to use this book for a fresh idea.Your Weekly Writing Exercise1.  Consider the benefits of a writing partnership.  Is there someone who might support you in your writing journey?  A fellow book writer, especially?  Take one step toward exploring this idea this week.2.  Visit Carole and Lynn's blogs--they are wonderful.  Lynn: Present Lettershttp://lynnobermoeller.blogspot.com/Carole: Lasting Impressionshttp://letterpressdaughter.blogspot.com/"},
{"title": "A Cure for Writer's Block:  Value Writing--A Surprise Post by One of Mary's Editors", "date": "Tuesday, March 13, 2012", "text": "Mary is off writing, which is a good thing for a writing teacher to do every now and then. News flash: many writing teachers don’t actually write all that much. Of course they used to. There were the novels, the plays, the essays, the articles. And better yet, payment for their writing. They were “real writers.” Then …for quite a few of them, the writing sort of dwindled. This may be your story, as well. It’s definitely mine. (I am a former publisher/editor who is hard at work NOT working on a book about Montaigne the writer who invented the personal essay.)  I have got good excuses. Life gets in the way—there’s all that family, health, laundry. You know, \"issues.\" And in the grand world of employment, writing often does not pay that well. Writing can start to feel like you are building a house on spec, where you use your own hard-earned cash to build a snazzy house in the hopes that when you sell it you will recoup your money and make a pile in royalties. The thing is, I don’t have the money or patience to write on spec. Does that qualify as writer’s block? Not really.Spec is short for speculation, a noun that can mean “contemplation of a subject” and “engagement in a risky business transaction in the hope of profit from changes in the market price.”Know anything else that calls for the mutually exclusive acts of contemplation and engagement in an activity in the hopes of big payout from market changes? Hint: it is what I am trying to do right now. So I got to thinking… why don’t more of us go off and sink some time into our writing like Mary? For the same reason most of us don’t buy shares in a gold mine in Peru. You could make a bundle, but chances are you would lose your shirt. Why? A gazillion reasons--the mine is about to be nationalized; the mine is lying on a fault line; the mine doesn’t even have gold in it, it has silver. When you are trying to sell spec stuff, there is no way to know all the variables. The same goes with writing. Writing is a risky business. You invest gobs of time, and the upside is a book contract with the six-figure advance. Great! Ah, but the downsides are huge, and here is the kicker: you won’t know why your book didn’t pay out. The reasons are just as specious as the Peruvian mine. For example, the publisher you sent it to says it now wants vampires not zombies, the editor “just” did a book like yours two years ago, the one agent who got back to you said your main character does not have enough “fill-in-blank” adjective, the book group who read it said it was too long, another group said it was too short. No surprise when risk does not get rewarded, it leads to risk aversion and money gets stuffed under the mattress. When it comes to writing, risk aversion leads to something known as …. wait for it… writer’s block.  How many of us have a book stuffed under our bed? This is not necessarily your fault. It is simply the price you pay when dealing in an unregulated publishing market. What to do? How do you turn speculation into safety? There are lots of answers, but it has occurred to me recently that maybe it pays to actually discover what the market wants to read. That means attending publishing conferences, marketing seminars on how to sell books. Learn the business from the publisher’s point of view. Learn who their customer really is. Hint: it is not you. Now here is where it gets weird: while publishers claim they want safety, they secretly pine for the new, the different, the unknown. They want a piece of that risky Peruvian mine. They just want it to be really well written. What’s a smart writer like you to do? There are a ton of ideas out there, you probably have read all the do’s and don’ts like me. But here is a new “do” idea—do what the most successful investor of all time does. Ignore the market. Warren Buffet could care less about the market’s ups and downs; he invests for the long haul. And only in those companies that have a significant competitive advantage over its competitors. He calls this advantage the \"economic moat,\" and the wider a company’s moat, the more valuable the company. The trick is figuring out what a company has going for it that sets it apart from its competitors. For Warren, his value investing called for a new type of analysis that requires some number crunching and a whole lot of gut checking. Value Writing--The Cure for Writer's BlockThe cure for writer’s block could be something remarkably similar: value writing. Perhaps the problem is not with the writing, but the way we analyze our writing. Maybe all we need to do is to start asking better questions about our work. Start with the basics: what you like to read and why. Do you read to escape from the everyday drudgery? Do you read to learn something new? To be moved by the actions of complex characters? Before you can write to be read, you need to start asking tougher questions about your story. What moved you so much it you found yourself writing it down? Was it the drama? The complex characters? Solving a mystery? Wanting to share family legacies? Does this come across in your own writing? If not, why not? What does come across in your writing? If you are answering these questions truthfully, you should start to feel a little buzz of energy about now. Now get ready for the really big value-illuminating question: what is the question your book is attempting to answer? (I can see your eyes starting to cross. Knock it off!) For a book to have value it needs to ask at least one really compelling question and then answer it. Will Oliver Twist grow up to live a long and healthy life? Can a white would-be writer manage to tell the story of two black maids in the deep south in the 1960s? Does knowing the personal history of Henrietta Lacks shed new light on how we look at cancer research? Yes, yes, and yes.Does your opus have a compelling question? If you stopped writing it midway through, I can almost guarantee that it doesn’t. Hence the writer’s block.  Get on our knees, and dig out your manuscript from under the bed. Blow off the dust bunnies, and see if you can’t find that question. Once you do, the drive to answer it will fuel your writing and add a whole lot of moat to your work. Our guest blogger is a former editor with a large book publishing company.  She was also the editor for Mary's newest book, Your Book Starts Here, for which Mary is eternally grateful."},
{"title": "A Whole New Mind:  Why Right Brainers Will Rule the Future", "date": "Monday, February 27, 2012", "text": "Did you grow up thinking you were an alien on a very strange planet, because you liked to daydream and doodle and muse over words and invent weird plots for stories?  Even as an adult, until I became a writing teacher and started publishing those plots in books and stories, I worried a little that my brain was not working like everyone else's.I got good training in how to think linearly, but I really preferred thinking from a global view, seeing patterns and systems and how the disparate pieces intertwined, rather than looking at their separate and orderly parts.Daniel H. Pink's well-loved book, A Whole New Mind:  Why Right Brainers Will Rule the World, gave me hope.  I wasn't crazy.  I was just a right-brainer.  Many writers are.  Especially book writers, who need to have a holistic view to make their books work for readers.Pink is the also author of Drive, which is about human motivation.  He understands the brain and how it works--especially for creative thinkers like book writers--and I find his theories helpful in my classes.  For 12 years I've been trying to help book writers learn the right-brain skills that will make their books read as a whole rather than a series of parts.Cultivating a Holistic Viewpoint--Your Book Needs It Holistic viewpoints are the work of the right brain.  While the left brain, as I understand it, sees things in sequence and in part, the right brain sees the whole.  Many book writers find themselves at a loss when trying to create this holistic feel to their book.  Chapters come across as individual units rather than part of a larger whole.  Two skills that Pink describes--narrative and design--are born in the right hemisphere and are useful when you want to make your manuscript feel like one instead of many.The first, narrative, might seem obvious.  After all, we're book writers, we have a narrator, we write narrative.  But do we really?Narrative is actually the aspect of story that I call \"flow\" or pacing.  Strong narrative keeps a reader reading. The flow is like a strong river.  It's often simply a matter of good transitions, how fast you deliver your information, and excellent design.  Design is about making a story logical yet also appealing to the aesthetic senses.  We consider design when we think about knowing how much to add, and how much to just imply.  It's about skillfully shaping your book with enough image to fire the imagination of the reader.    This week, your weekly writing exercise is to find a copy and try one of the Portfolio exercises on narrative or design that Pink offers.  Let me know how your right brain likes it. And check out Pink's other writing at this link."},
{"title": "Making a Map of Your Book's Structure--Three Different Kinds of Storyboards", "date": "Sunday, February 19, 2012", "text": "Storyboards, the visual map that  filmmakers use, are a lifesaver for writers needing to brainstorm the structure of their books.  I use them to chart the primary pathway through my  piles of material.  A great tool for organizing and structuring  novels, nonfiction books, and memoirs, they can be approached in three ways.Both my online classes and my Grub Street workshop on February 26 play with storyboards , so I wanted to revisit the three kinds you can use, depending on where you are in developing your story.First, remember that storyboards benefit both writer and reader, but in different ways.  For the writer, they give the first glimpse of the book's structure.  I couldn't possible create publishable books without them.For the reader, the storyboard smooths the pathway through the story.  Holes in the narrative become very apparent and can be filled.  Too much talking also shows up clearly--as well as digressions.  Storyboards help you trim the fat and bulk it up--wherever each is needed.But storyboards can also help you chart a character's growth, or the development of a place (setting).Storyboard Resistance Many writers resist storyboards.  They aren't always as fun as the \"flow\" writing that we think of when we imagine creative writing.  You have to use the more linear part of your brain. On good days storyboards yield tremendous insights into why that &*%% chapter feels so out of sync or what kind of ending might work best. On bad days, storyboards feel like bossy mother-in-laws, telling us what we're doing wrong.  They point out exactly what we don't want to look  at about the book-in-progress:  where we have too much blah-blah-blah,  where we've skipped a juicy opportunity for conflict, where we've stayed  on track or gone on a tangent. Essentially, it becomes clear as day where the book isn't yet working.This can derail some writers. Storyboards also present, often for the first time, the glimpse of how your book will be when it's actually published.  Sometimes this is so scary (the thought of actually being published!) that writers abandon the project in emotional overload. But I believe in storyboards.  I create several for each book I write and I keep the best ones on my office walls, reminders that I am grateful for their linear know-it-all attitude.   Better realize the problems now, via a piece of posterboard in the privacy of your own home, than later via a rejection letter from an agent, yes?The Golden Opportunity of StoryboardsA big question as you begin your book is this:  How are you going to  know if your story flows when it's outside of your own inner worlds?You can craft a draft, of course.  Get it typed out and printed, read  through it.  But it's still hard to see if the idea you presented on  page 31 will thread through to page 231 in a way your reader will track.Some writers make long lists.  I do this too.  Facts to check, threads  to follow.  The lists on my desk are as numerous as my printed drafts,  after a while, and I start to go crazy under all that paper.  Here's  where storyboards present a golden opportunity, like a good map out of a  swamp.A writer needs to know the structure of her story flow, the placement in  time and space of each idea or plot point.  It's not just enough to  churn out the words. The sequence matters, a sequence that readers can  follow, and you need some method to clearly see sequence. Filmmakers use  storyboards to provide this.I use a giant W to structure my storyboards or a row of empty boxes  lined up on my posterboard. I place Post-it notes along the W that  represents scenes or ideas or chapters, then I move them around until  the sequence of ideas equals a reasonable flow for my book.This kind of storyboard charts the events, the outer story, and you can see if you have enough happening.  Character StoryboardsAnother kind of storyboard charts the character's growth through the book. Early in the revision process of my novel Qualities of Light, I did a storyboard for each of the main characters.  I learned, to my dismay, that one of them, Chad, had dropped out of sight in chapter 10.  Not so great because he was competing for Molly's attention as the other love interest in the story.  By crafting a character storyboard for Chad, I could immediately see the problem--and it was not apparent when I read the draft. I used a character storyboard to chart the progress of my reader through my nonfiction book, Your Book Starts Here, and realized I had planted too advanced material too early in the book.  Once I saw that the reader (my character, in a sense) wouldn't have understood some of the basic principles by that point, I could rearrange the chapter order to not overwhelm or confuse.  Much better sequence. It's not uncommon to emerge from a storyboarding session with an  awareness of what still needs to be written--whether it's an event or a scene to show an aspect of a character.  I usually find missing  sections or even chapters, places where a character or location has  dropped out of sight, transitions that need to be made. Research still  to do. Setting (Container) StoryboardsSometimes a book's setting is so real and vivid, it is like a  character.  I love books like this.  When I want to create them, I use a  storyboard to track the \"development\" of my setting--how it grows in  influence and changes in impact through the story. So a third way to use storyboards is for your setting, or the \"container\" of your story--its culture, value and belief system, its history and atmosphere, the physical and psychological effect it has on the people and events. Chart the images, when you do this one.  How do they change as the story proceeds?  (Scroll down to review the impact of images in the post from last week.) What If You're Just Starting ?  Using a Storyboard to Brainstorm I also use storyboarding during the first weeks and months of my book journey--when I have little written.  I imagine, or brainstorm, ideas for how I might create the narrative.  On the Post-It notes, I jot scenes or ideas or things I want to include.  Then I begin arranging them on the W storyboard, just to see what I have.  Most of the time, I get more ideas from this.  In fact, ideas start flooding in.Storyboarding really lets you see possible ways to bring your book into manifestation.So you can use storyboards to begin your journey or to organize it when you start to feel restless and overwhelmed with the amount  of words you've collected.  It's always a good time to storyboard when you want a  clear direction and development of your original idea.This Week's Writing ExerciseThis week, watch the video below. Then get yourself to an office supply store. Buy a posterboard and some Post-It notes. Go home, take a deep breath,  and try creating your W storyboard.  Start with just two moments:  the  opening and ending of your book, by asking yourself the questions below.1.  Where might you begin? What moment do you see launching your reader  into your topic or story? Write a note about this on a Post-It and place  it on the storyboard.2.  What moment might end your book? Where would you like the reader to  be at the last page--with what new understanding, hunger, idea or  feeling?

{"title": "Creating the Image Arc for Your Book", "date": "Sunday, February 12, 2012", "text": "This week I'm in Florida, treating myself to a workshop with my wonderful painting instructor, Susan Sarback of the School of Light and Color.  It's truly a gift to myself to be able to get away from the chill of New England and get saturated with images of sea, sun, and sky. It seems fitting that last week one of my online classes created the \"image arcs\" for their books, a process I didn't have a clue about as a new writer, but which transformed my understanding of story when I found out about it.Image arcs exist in all books--essays and short stories often have them too, although they are most apparent in longer works.  Images thread something called the \"inner story\" which is where readers get the emotion from your writing.  Events provide momentum; images provide emotion.  Both are needed to (1) keep a reader reading and (2) make your story have an impact on more than just an intellectual level. When readers \"fall in love\" with books, it's usually because the image arc is strong and well threaded throughout the chapters, from beginning to end.But how does a writer begin working with her book's image arc?I didn't even know the image arc existed when I began my early books, and I worked primarily with editors at the publishing houses who took care of that sort of thing.  I was responsible for the material itself, they did the fine-tuning.  But as I published more and taught more about how books are constructed, I found out about this very important element. So this week I want to share with you the writing exercise that my online class has been working on (Part 3 of Your Book Starts Here class, sponsored by the Loft Literary Center).  I find this exercise interesting to do at any stage of book writing, but it's most helpful at revision.Your Weekly Writing Exercise:  Creating Image Arcs Images link the parts of your book's inner story, providing a pathway for a reader to follow.  Images are part of \"language\" revision.  This exercise asks you to track  the key images in your book to see if they create this all-important  pathway for your reader.1.  Look at the 5 main moments of your book.  You can use the W storyboard, as explained in this video I made.  Write down the events associated with these moments, as specifically as you can.  To do this exercise correctly, it's important to choose one event or a small series of events that happened in the same time frame (not over weeks or years, for example, but in several hours or one day).  2.  List the primary location for each of these 5 events.  You may also notice that certain objects, or details of atmosphere such as weather, stand out in these events. 3.  Find the key image in each of these 5 locations.  The key image  might be a body of water, an object, a certain sense like smell or  weather, a building, a color, a texture.  Make a list of these 5 main  images.  Note:  you may have images that repeat within these 5--that's  fine.  Ask yourself how the repeating image changes, evolves, at the  different points.4.  Now look at the chapters between each point.  They are bookended by a  pair of images, yes?  (Act 1 has two main points, triggering event as  #1 and end of act 1 as #2.)  How does each chapter between those  bookends continue the image you begin and transition to the image you  end with?5.  Can you build this pathway, or image arc, in the chapters between your points?This is a wonderful but challenging exercise.  If it interests you and you'd like to work more on it, consider attending one of my summer or fall retreats on beautiful Madeline Island (July and September this year), where we spend five days together exploring the deeper levels of your book--including its image arc."},
{"title": "Drawing Solutions--How Visual Maps Help Your Book-Writing Dreams Come True", "date": "Sunday, February 5, 2012", "text": "I first met Patti Dobrowolski at a seminar on the East Coast, at a time when I was trying to manifest a new goal with my writing--finish and get my book on writing, Your Book Starts Here, published at last. I knew I was stuck.  I felt overwhelmed by the need for a good editor and a bigger vision for the book.I had lots of chapters, but I knew they weren't especially good.Patti is a fireball on stage.  She loves what she does, which is mostly about drawing or visually mapping the goal-setting process.  She handed out copies of a simple goal-setting worksheet made up of three parts:  (1) a place to describe the vision of how you'd be or feel when your goal was realized, (2) any obstacles that stood between you and your goal, and (3) three bold steps to take.Patti is the founder of Up Your Creative Genius,  a consulting firm that uses visuals and creative processes to help  companies and individuals around the world accelerate growth and change.  A critically acclaimed comic performer, internationally recognized  keynote speaker, writer and business consultant. She talked about how  she'd imagined getting into a Broadway show in New York, and how she  used this goal-setting method to imagine it.  Of course, it came true.   Since then, Patti has brought her innovative visual practices to NGOs,  Fortune 500 companies, small businesses and individuals around the  world.So, in that seminar, I wrote down my vision for my book project.  I  imagined finding a wonderful editor who would help me take it the final  steps to publication.  I saw it being the basis for my classes, and I  wrote down how it would benefit all the writers who would use it.  Three Bold Steps The last aspect--three bold steps--intrigued me the most.  I thought about this seriously.  What would be my wildest dream?  First, to find a fabulous editor who believed in my book and would be able to help me take the final steps in shaping it.  I knew such an editor in New York, but she was pretty busy.  I took a deep breath and wrote as one of my bold steps to email her and ask.  She might think I was insane but it really wouldn't hurt.The second bold step was to take the plunge and get my website revamped.  It was old and tired, and I knew just the right person to help with that.  But what I had in mind would cost thousands.  Was I really able to justify the cost right now?  Would it make that much difference?  I imagined the book being published, people visiting the site, and decided yes. The third bold step was about my book cover.  I wanted something really great.  I also wanted the interior to look amazing, with some graphics and a clean feel and wide margins for taking notes.  So I wrote down:  Find a designer and typesetter whose work I love.After the seminar, even though I was reinvigorated by Patti's unique method, I put the chart away as life went on.  Daily demands took me away from my book ideas and it wasn't until a month later that I remembered Patti's chart and what I had promised myself.  I found it and looked over my three bold steps.  They still seemed incredibly scary to me, but I knew they were what I wanted.  I started taking action.Miracles Happened!  This Method Works! The editor, to my drop-dead astonishment, said yes.  She and I began working together and within months the manuscript took shape, becoming something so much better than I could've imagined.  With the enthusiasm of that success behind me, I contacted the website designer and forked over the money to start working with her.  When she sent me the template for her redesign I was astonished again--a huge step up.  Amazingly, she also did book design work and I talked with her about a possible cover.  Again, the results were better than I had imagined.  The best typesetter in the world was also easy to find.Was this magic?  Or just good visioning, with the help of Patti Dobrowolski's wonderful template?  Had she really allowed me to tap into my creativity--my creative genius--in some new way, which allowed these miracles to happen?I'm a great believer in good visioning.  And a firm supporter of Patti's way of doing it.Her new book is just out, which gives all the details of how to do this visioning for yourself.  It's called Drawing Solutions and it's wonderful.  She's doing a book give-away contest the week of February 12 and click here to enter the contest.Questions for Patti I asked Patti to answer some questions about her process and how she discovered it, then wrote her book.  Here's our conversation:When did you first know you wanted to write a book?In 1995, I began experimenting with using visuals to goal set and develop the Snapshot of the Big Picture process. I realized how simple it was for me to make change when I had a visual to help inspire me, and be a road map for the success.  It was at this point that I thought, I should really write a book about this.    How long did this book take to write, from first written word to publication?    I started writing the book at a workshop lead by a writer's coach, Tom Bird.  I remember sitting next to a woman at a conference and she was the speaker and her book had just come out.  I asked her how long it took and she said, \"Five years.\"  I thought to myself, I just finished my first draft, it will never be five years, maybe 1-1/2 at best.  How long did it take me?  Exactly five years!Who do you imagine is your ideal reader for this book?The ideal reader is someone who has a dream but isn't sure quite how to get it started.  It may be as simple as writing your first book, or creating that change that keeps you up at night, that you fantasize about.  That is the perfect reader, because this book helps to motivate you and get you doing by helping you see that by using a visual and lining up your brain to start working for you, you too can make that dream a reality.What are some of the funny/tragic/inspiring experiences you had during the book-writing journey?      Tragic:  the typos that were found after I had two copy editors review the materials!  Funny:  how easy it was to get derailed in the process.  Anything became an excuse not to edit!  Here's a synchronistic thing:  Early on when I sent out query letters to get an agent, and one of the agencies that approached me gave me some really solid advice:  The agent said, \"Look at other people's websites:  you have to have a slick video, a cool platform, a unique differentiator.\"  He then offered to coach me for about $10,000.  I declined, of course, thinking I could get that stuff together on my own (which I did).  Recently I got a referral from a friend to do a private coaching session for a woman in transition (this is a two-hour session I do in person or on Skype and I draw a big map for them real time)  That woman was the former business partner of that agent.  She had left the agency and was going out on her own.      What's some advice you might give a new writer who is interested in putting together a book? Discipline is critical!  In my case, what I learned from Tom was to get up every day and write for two hours or a certain number of words, without going back and editing.  Also, I went all the way through just writing the book before I came back and edited it.  I wrote longhand and when I went to transcribe it into the computer, that was my first edit.What's your experience with publishing these days and why did you decide to publish the way you did?  While I did land an agent, he couldn't ever figure out how to get a publisher interested in my book. So I decided to do POD (print on demand self-publishing), which Tom Bird outlines in his writing.  I think, for me, this was absolutely the best choice. I am still learning about it, but all that money that would have gone to a publisher goes directly into my pocket and that is very satisfying.  It does go right back out the door, however, for advertising, etc.  But I think it is worth it.What would you never do again, in terms of book writing or publishing?  Probably never work with an editor I didn't know. I spent a huge amount of money getting a \"writing coach\" and a New York editor who was recommended by a  friend of a friend.  While I was happy to have them, I see now that they took me down a path that diverged from me developing my own voice, and I eventually scrapped what they had me write and went back to my original idea.    Anything else you want to share?  While writing a book is an enormous amount of work, there is nothing quite as satisfying as finishing it.  It feels like a huge mountain, but once you are on the top, you see the whole range of mountains there are and yet each of those next peaks do not feel quite as daunting as this one.  Your Weekly Writing Exercise The weekly writing exercise is to check out Patti's book!  You may have some miracles appear in your life because of it, as happened to me.Imagine your personal three bold steps, and see what it might take to bring your book into manifestation."},
{"title": "Working with Images to Get More Emotion into Your Chapters", "date": "Monday, January 30, 2012", "text": "This week, a fellow writer in New York sent me this bit of wisdom from writer Richard Bausch, who is known for his wonderful short stories. Bausch has been published widely, and he currently teaches in the writing program at the University of Memphis.  His thoughtful ideas on image and emotion will be the basis for our writing exercise this week.\"Make your feeling in things, images. There is so much more in an image because that is how we experience the world, and a good story is about experience, not concepts and certainly not abstractions. The abstractions are always finally empty and dull no matter how dear they may be to our hearts and no matter how profound we think they must be. I am perfectly aware that I am presently speaking in abstractions. So here is an example: there has been an auto accident. A head-on collision. We can say it contains all the horror of death and injury, and the terrible shocks to existence that await us all. Or--as my pal Allan Gurganus did once long ago in a workshop we were in, talking about this very matter--we can say a man with blood trickling from his ear and eyes wide and glittering unnaturally, knelt, shaking, at one of the broken headlights, trying, with trembling fingers, to put the pieces of shattered glass back into place. That opens the richest vein of horror,  and it is experience, and we witness it, and feel it. So, in revision, get rid of all those places where you are commenting on things, and let the things stand for themselves. Be clear about  the details that can be felt on the skin and in the nerves.\"This is echoed in one of my favorite writing books, From Where You Dream by Robert Olen Butler.  Butler recommends doing away with any interpretation (thoughts and feelings about things, essentially).  Let the things stand for themselves.Readers are awfully smart.  They can get the meaning behind the message, if the message is delivered through images. In my writing classes, I help writers see how their book's \"inner story,\" or the message of meaning in their writing, is primarily delivered to the reader through these images that reveal emotion, rather than through abstract thoughts and feelings.This often seems counter-intuitive to the new book writer.  But look at your favorite stories.  Often the emotion is presented at a peak moment through a gesture, an object, the way light glints on a table top that's just been shined.  Images are how readers absorb the emotional impact, or payoff, of such a moment in a book.  I find this true, no matter which genre we're working in. For this week's writing exercise, I encourage you to test this out. Your Weekly Writing Exercise1.  Choose a passage from your writing that is abstract:  maybe it's internal monologue, or thoughts and feelings from a character or narrator or author.2.  Locate a tangible \"thing,\" as Bausch says, that could possible convey this emotion or thought.3.  Play with taking out the abstract and letting the thing speak for itself.  4.  See if the emotional impact is enhanced."},
{"title": "Pros and Cons of First and Third Person Point of View", "date": "Sunday, January 22, 2012", "text": "One of my online students recently emailed me with a very good question.  Many book writers struggle with this during revision:  which to use, first person or third person. Which has the most impact on the story?  What are the pros and cons of each voice?Sometimes the writer will create \"islands\" or scenes or snippets of writing in different points of view, as she moves through making the manuscript.  This is absolutely fine--it gives our random creative selves freedom to test out many options.  But when you've finally assembled your first draft, you need to settle it down.  You need to choose a point of view that tells the story best.A wonderful writer, much published, once told me this secret:  for newer writers (new to book-length works), it's easier to get to know the characters in first person voice.  \"The first book is often first person,\" she said, \"the next ones are in third person.\" I found this true.  My first novel was attempted in third person but I had a terrible time bringing the main character to light on the page.  She seemed so distant.  On the advice of a writing teacher, I converted her scenes to first person. Suddenly she was visible, audible, clear to me.But when I began work on my second novel, the me-me-me of first person was a bit hard to take.  First person can come across very self-absorbed.  Which is beautiful in short pieces, tiresome in longer ones, like listening to a rant.  To make first person palatable, much has to be worked in the environment of the story--letting the setting (container) reflect the emotions of the first-person narrator, rather than the narrator always delivering them.In crafting my first book in first person, I learned this the hard way.  My teachers red-penciled out long and, to me, lyrical passages of self-reflection.  I remember one x-ed out an entire page, writing \"Enough!\" in the margin.  And it was.  I'd learned one of the downsides of first person voice--it can be way too much. My current novel, written in third person, is difficult in its own way.  Third is more distant, so I have to work harder to bring out the emotions of each character.  I usually write \"islands\" in first person, in their voices, to get to know them.  Then switch over to third for the actual scenes and chapters Memoir--Its Particular Challenges Memoirists have a tricky task here--memoir is always written in first person (except for very experimental memoir) because it's all about me, the narrator, anyway.  It's my story, and no one else can tell it.  So the memoir runs the risk of being very blah blah blah about their own precious thoughts and feelings, which the reader may not care about. I've been enjoying two memoirs this week that do very well with the first-person challenge:  Don't Let's Go to the Dogs Tonight, by Alexandra Fuller, and Let's Take the Long Way Home, by Gail Caldwell. Fuller makes use of setting brilliantly--we completely get her personality in the story, but we see it against the very large backdrop of the Rhodesian civil war, and that puts her personal angst in perspective beautifully. Caldwell falters occasionally in her memoir.  A long chapter about her alcoholism left me slightly bored with her; I found myself skipping ahead to where the story reunites with her friend's story, the meat of this book (about her friend's death).  I found it hard to just have Caldwell's musings without the stronger backdrop of something of bigger importance than a single life.As my student wrote, \"First person gives more immediacy and emotional punch,\" and it certainly does.  But one human life, with its singular thoughts and feelings, needs always to be balanced in literature with a broader landscape.  Otherwise, the self-absorption will deafen the larger voice and theme of the book.She also wrote, \"Third person allows for more backstory, summary, and the internals of more than one character at a time. It allows for more emotional coloring.\"  This is true.  The range of colors is wider, too.  Which makes for a potentially more profound story.  She was kind enough to send two examples from her book, which she gave me permission to share here.  One is written in third person, the second in first person, with the same narrator.  Which appeals more to you, as the reader? Third personJenna is always touched with a wisp of melancholy when she sees him and she chides herself for thinking of him other than the way he is now. She knows that, his tall figure is slumped in his wheelchair, his stringy muscles gone flaccid and shrunken; his forehead is a map of wrinkles and brown spots below a no longer existent hairline. Still, he holds her fast to this earth though he is disappearing before her eyes and it matters, more than anything, and not of knee-jerk reaction either, to please him.First personWhen Dad isn't in front of me, I forget; I think of him as he was when he was younger. Now, every time I see him, I'm overcome with melancholy. I stand a moment at the door to the sun room and the surprise sweeps me again. His tall frame is slumped in his wheelchair, all his stringy muscles gone flaccid and shrunken; his forehead is a map of winkles and brown spots just below where his hairline used to be. Still, I think, he holds me fast to this earth and being his stand-up girl matters as much as it did when I was a kid.Very different effects, yes?  Your Weekly Writing Exercise1.  Take a passage from your own writing, about the length of the one above.  Write it in the opposite voice as you've chosen.  If it's third, make it first.  if it's first, make it third.2.  Read each aloud.  Which feels more layered, more interesting to you?3.  Even if you are writing memoir, try this.  It's very revealing--you can see immediately where you've neglected the larger landscape of your story."},
{"title": "From Event to Emotion--How Do You Bridge the Gap in Your Writing?", "date": "Saturday, January 14, 2012", "text": "E.M Forester said that human beings lead two lives, \"the life in time and the life by values.\"  In Aspects of the Novel, he writes: \"A story is a narrative of events arranged in their time sequence — it simply tells us what happened and in what order. It is the time sequence which turns a random collection of episodes into a story. But chronological sequence is a very primitive feature and it can have only one merit: that of making the audience want to know what happens next. The only skill of a storyteller is their ability to wield the weapon of suspense, making the audience eager to discover the next event in the sequence.    \"This emphasis on chronological sequence is a difference from real life. Our real lives also unfold through time but have the added feature that  some experiences have greater value and meaning than others. Value has no role in a story, which is concerned with the life in time rather than the life by values.\"She waited for him for thirty minutes, but it felt like forever is a  good example of this dual experience that we go through in real life, but makes for dull reading if placed in a book as it really happened (thirty minutes of not much).But our books are enriched, our characters more vivid, if we can show both of these lives, the one driven by events and the  one driven by the inner journey, or what writer Vivian Gornick calls the situation and the story behind it.  Obviously, readers crave meaning.  And they are best carried along by both the  tension of the event and its emotional undercurrent.  This week's exercise asks you to look at a peak moment in your book and analyze it based on this  duality.  How much of each kind of time have you dedicated to this  moment?  Most writers put 80-90 percent of their storytime into the \"time value\" that Forster speaks of, since this provides tension and momentum.  But a small percentage of every scene must also be revealed as \"value time,\" revealing the meaning of that event.Skilled writers do this through showing, versus telling.  What a character notices in her environment during a particularly tense moment, for instance, shows us the value of that event to her.  Smells, sounds, visual details, weather--all of these are used by writers to help show value and meaning."},
{"title": "Rest Breaks for Writers--Feeding the Creative Artist", "date": "Sunday, December 18, 2011", "text": "I'm rerunning this blog from last December, since it is timely at this season.  To honor my artist and focus on my writing, the blog will be taking a break until the first week of January.  Feel free to browse the archives back to 2008 for inspiration--and consider taking a rest break and feed your own creative artist this month!There are some important signs of burn-out that writers need to attend  to.  An overactive Inner Critic.  A feeling of the blues about one's  work.  A sense of deep depletion, despite enough sleep and exercise.December often rolls around with all of these symptoms, for me.  I'm finishing up my fall semester of teaching my online and in-person classes.  I adored them--the students were amazing, wonderful, and  inspiring-- but I give so much to each group, holding the creative space  for them when they can't see the pathway, it takes a lot of energy and time.  This week, as the classes complete and the last posts are made, I find myself sitting on the couch, staring at the  mountains outside my living room window, wondering where I am.  More important, who I am.  I can't tell anymore.Crying jags often accompany this, for me.  Wails of \"I'll  never write again\" sometimes come too.  It's normal to dive even deeper  as the tension releases and the stress lessens, as both body and  emotions come forward with long-ignored needs. Don't get me wrong:  I  eat healthily, I exercise regularly, I sleep reasonable hours, and I  have good family and friends support.  I'm living a good life.  But in  the realm of manifestation and creativity, which is what my work is all  about, I had been stretched to the max these past months.  I didn't know  any other gear to drive than Intense.  I didn't know how to get  back to the \"necessary boredom\" that Dorothy Allison talks about, the  place where my own creativity bubbles up. Somehow, though, I'd managed to carve out three weeks in my calendar.   My spouse started a new job about that time, my son was visiting friends  for the holidays, so I was alone.Blissfully, frightfully alone, with nothing to do.  Or, let me rephrase, nothing anyone else was asking me to do.So what next?  How do I make use of this nothing, and let it heal me, fill me up again?  I hadn't a clue how to begin.Taking a Creative Retreat for the Inner Artist I have a wonderful book for these occasions:  The Woman's Retreat Book  by Jennifer Louden.  It's packed with ways to disengage and reacquaint  yourself with yourself.  I found it on a back shelf, went back to my  spot on the couch near the mountain view.  I closed my eyes and opened  the book at random.  Of course, it opened to this section \"Feeding the  Artist.\"  I read the first line: \"If there is one cosmic law I know the  consequences of ignoring, it is this one:  you cannot create from an  empty well.\"Duh.  Why didn't I see this before I had my meltdown?  Well, obviously,  when one is empty, it's hard to see that.  Many of us keep running  anyway, fueled by adrenaline, and the joy of life gets dimmer and  dimmer.  We lose track of where we are, who we are.  We get swept up  with other people's lives (and creative needs--if you're a teacher).   It's all good, it's all important.  I love my work.  But there's a  moment to say, \"Stop!\"  Let yourself go back to yourself.I decided I would ignore both calendar and lists for these three weeks,  as much as I could.  Even my visioning lists went into a nice blue  folder and into my desk drawer.  I began to putter, to play.The first day I cooked two soups.  I love to cook, and two soups in one  day seemed lovely and extravagant.  Besides, the vegetable drawer was  foreign territory and I could use up a dangerous-looking butternut  squash (fine with the dangerous part cut off).  I took a walk and went  to bed by 9.  The next day I listened to Christmas carols and wrapped a  few gifts then read a lovely novel (Let the Great World Spin  by Colum McCann) and let myself nap.  Day three I got out the card  table and started a jigsaw puzzle.  I cleaned out my clothes closet.  I  took myself to lunch.You get the idea.One of Jennifer Louden's most important directives in this chapter on  \"Feeding the Artist\" is not to create while you're filling the well.   Stop working on your project, stop trying to manifest anything.  Ugh,  that was hard.  I hadn't had enough time to work on my  novel-in-progress, so these three weeks were planned as full immersion.   But when I took out the manuscript and my editing pen, I froze up.  It  all looked terrible--a sure sign of the Inner Critic's negative notions  surfacing--and I couldn't bring myself to do anything.  Reading Louden's  advice felt like a reprieve.Funny thing.  As I began to fill up again, new ideas started coming.  I  would be watching a movie or marveling at McCann's amazing prose, and I  would find myself thinking very lightly about my own creative projects.   Images would come.  An idea of how to solve a sticky plot problem in  the novel.  A place to get information I needed.  I didn't pursue these,  just took notes.I'm letting the creative tension build for another week.  It's getting  fun.  I look forward to my empty days, I no long dread the thought of  moving so slowly. This Week's Writing Exercise  1.  Take stock.  Do you need to feed the artist?  Is she or he starving  from too much output and not enough input these past busy months?2.  If the answer is yes, can you carve out time for a rest break?  Even  five hours in a day when nothing is needed of you is amazing and  precious."},

She was rejected by over 100 literary agents and dozens of publishers, then went on to self-publish her debut novel and sell over 400,000 copies on Kindle.  Think this kind of story is a fairytale?  It's happening more and more.The link to Darcie's story is here.Self-publishing is still a controversial topic.  But as the industry takes one hit after another, it's an option many writers are considering--and succeeding with.For more success stories about self-publishing also check out chapter 25 of my book, Your Book Starts Here."},

They are my primary pathway through my piles of material.  They are my best tool for organizing and structuring my novels, nonfiction books, and memoirs so that a reader can make sense of the story.I love them.  I couldn't make publishable books without them.I also hate storyboards. They are like bossy mother-in-laws, telling me what I'm doing wrong.  They point out exactly what I don't want to look at about my book-in-progress:  where I have too much blah-blah-blah, where I've skipped a juicy opportunity for conflict, where I've stayed on track or gone on a tangent. Essentially, it becomes clear as day where my book isn't yet working.I teach storyboards, I have several hanging on my office walls, and I barely tolerate their linear know-it-all attitude.  But I think they're gold.  The Golden Opportunity of StoryboardsA big question as you begin your book is this:  How are you going to know if your story flows when it's outside of your own inner worlds?You can craft a draft, of course.  Get it typed out and printed, read through it.  But it's still hard to see if the idea you presented on page 31 will thread through to page 231 in a way your reader will track.Some writers make long lists.  I do this too.  Facts to check, threads to follow.  The lists on my desk are as numerous as my printed drafts, after a while, and I start to go crazy under all that paper.  Here's where storyboards present a golden opportunity, like a good map out of a swamp.A writer needs to know the structure of her story flow, the placement in time and space of each idea or plot point.  It's not just enough to churn out the words. The sequence matters, a sequence that readers can follow, and you need some method to clearly see sequence. Filmmakers use storyboards to provide this.What's a storyboard look like?  Check out  this video where I demonstrate a storyboard.   Read more »"},

{"title": "That Tricky Balance of Show and Tell in Your Writing--How Do You Work with It?", "date": "Sunday, July 31, 2011", "text": "One of my favorite quotes about showing versus telling comes from Anton Chekhov, who wrote, “Don’t tell me the moon is shining; show me the glint of light on broken glass.”  This seems to sum it up.  Readers get emotionally engaged in writing that demonstrates rather than delivers. Not sure you agree?  Think of a book you may have read recently.  Did you skim any of it, skip some sections?  Go back and look at those pages, and perhaps you'll notice that the author went into her head a bit, perhaps.  Maybe she decided it was a good time to get on a small soapbox and explain something.  You lost interest, as a reader.  That's because telling contains less emotional charge, so we're less involved in the images of the story.Showing brings image to the page.  It's a demonstration of scene through specific details. Most books need to have more showing than telling nowadays, partly because of our fast-moving culture.  We have a shorter attention span.  Even movies are changing to adapt to the new ways our brains work. That's not to say that telling isn't important too.  Once something is framed on the page by shown details, a small bit of telling can deepen the meaning, the understanding a reader gets from the scene.This week I've been teaching a retreat with 11 writers from all over the world.  We're at Madeline Island School of the Arts, a beautiful art school located on restored farm on one of the Apostle Islands in Lake Superior near Bayfield, Wisconsin.  During class this week we were reading an excerpt from William Trevor's Cheating at Canasta, a short story about a woman who has Alzheimer's.  In this scene, the woman is playing cards with her husband, and although she can't really play cards anymore, he loves her so much that he helps her win.  After a page of showing this sad and beautiful relationship they have, Trevor ends with a line of \"telling\" that always knocks my socks off:  \"I cheated at Canasta, and she won.\"  Because the telling is framed by earlier shown detail, we totally get it. So while telling at its worst brings an almost intellectual assessment of what happened, and showing at its best relies instead on sensory detail (smells, sights, sounds), telling is important. Telling lets us back away from the moment, giving us brief perspective on what's been shown.  While showing places the reader squarely in the moment, telling gives distance.The key to showing is to demonstrate. This means not interpreting the things you are placing in front of us.Robert Olen Butler, author of many wonderful stories and novels and instructor at this writing at Florida State University’s MFA program, talks about this in his book From Where You Dream. To learn how to show better, I like to pass along these tips from Butler's book.  They help me deliver emotion in its purest form.Most important:  don’t dilute your moment with interpretation.Butler observed that emotion can be delivered to a reader (shown, versus told) generally in five ways. Here is my translation of his terms:• what I am feeling inside my body (goosebumps on my arm, itchy foot, tight throat)• what I am observing in your gestures and movements (tearing a small paper napkin into bits, jiggling foot)• specific memory• fear, anticipation, desire (projections into future)• sense selectivity (during moments of extreme emotion, all but one sense goes away)During the developing stage of book writing, whenever I need to change a scene to more “showing,” I will go through Butler’s list and ask myself how I can bring in one of these.Your Weekly Writing ExerciseThis week, translate a passage that \"tells\" into one that \"shows,\" using one of the above techniques.

Both take tons of practice, trial and error, failure and misery. Both have some magnificent moments. If you're not into gardening, forgive this analogy, but for me plants and soil have taught me a lot about the practice of writing. The patience I need, the forgiveness of my own big bloopers, the times when I want to chuck it all and go work at McDonalds (not really).I began gardening because three of my grandparents had the bug. My grandfather lived in Nyack, NY, right on the Hudson and he grew raspberry bushes and roses in a boxwood maze and flowers I could never hope to identify. We were both early risers. When I would visit, I could peer out my dormer window from bed and see him walking in the garden, so I'd get dressed fast and go out to join him. The raspberries were his precious spot. He pondered them like I ponder a chapter, scene, character. My grandfather taught me to go slow with creating. It worked well to put in time, both fingernail filthy time (digging into the soil, feeling it, working it with your hands) and pondering time.So that leads us to this week's topic: practice.

Outside, trees are in full leaf, lilacs are blooming, signs of spring are everywhere, unheard of in Minnesota in late April. But because of the rain, my class of 25 writers is content to be indoors.They've been working on their books all morning.  Now I've sent them off to write.  They are each going to travel the river that is their book.Viewing a book as a river let me imagine it as a journey.  I wonder which part of the river will make the most engaging focus for my story?  Memoirists, unlike autobiographical writers, choose one or more sections.  These must be filled with deep meaning.  They must have good content.So first we look at this question:  What's the most interesting landscape the river passes?  What content is the most relevant to the story I want to tell?Step One:  ContentChoosing content is a basic first step in crafting a manuscript, no matter what the genre.  Memoirists look at the content of their lives, the events that happened, and try to select those with the most impact.  While memoirists work from true events, novelists create story from fictional ones, but in the same manner--what engages the reader most easily?  Nonfiction writers also do this.  I may be writing a book on learning to play the piano, but the first essential question is What do I include and what do I omit?Content is the outer story, the facts or events your book revolves around.  You must have content, dramatic and engaging moments, to create any momentum.  To keep us reading.  A river always moves.How do you begin gathering content?  Read more »"},

Eventually you have to tie all the loose bits into reasonable conclusion. Great books leave us in love with the story we've just read, excited about the ideas we've just heard. There's an effect of satisfaction and engagement.  How does a writer achieve that?I learned about it one summer long ago, when I took a writing course at the University of Iowa.  My instructor taught me a concept that was new to me:  earned outcomes.  He referred to good endings, how they make sense because the hints are built in as we go along.  Yet they are not overly predictable.  I was attempting my first novel back then (one which will forever remain in the file cabinet) and I'd never before heard the question: Have you earned this outcome?He advised going back through the chapters, seeing if each thread brought into the ending actually wove, unbroken, back through the book.In that novel, there were so many broken threads, I couldn't finish it.  Conclusions I planted in my ending chapters were not foreshadowed earlier, so readers would certainly feel unpleasantly surprised, not pleasantly satisfied.  A good ending, or Act 3, of any piece of writing must be anticipated but not expected.  In other words, you plant the hints and you deliver the result in a way that makes us think, Wow, that's great, and I suspected it might be so.I learned a lot from that U of Iowa instructor.  Ten years later, when I was writing Act 3 of my second novel, Qualities of Light, I asked myself this \"earned outcome\" question.  I made a list of how I wanted the reader to feel about each character and major event by the last chapter.  Then I brainstormed that outcome, working backwards.Read more »"},

We wanted a system, an easier way to navigate a book-length manuscript, make the path easier to follow--not just for our eventual readers, but also for us, as writers.Many writers think that books are just expanded shorter pieces of writing.  I thought so too, at first.  I came from writing short and sweet, as a newspaper columnist for twelve years, and short pieces fit my creative impatience.   I liked the closure of writing something each week, limited and succinct.  I could work hard, get the writing done, and move on.  But I really wanted to dive into a book.I was naive in those days, innocent enough to think a book would be similar to the process of writing weekly columns.  Just longer, right?Wrong.Read more »"},
{"title": "Being on the Radio--WNPR Helps Me Fall in Love with My Story Again", "date": "Thursday, March 25, 2010", "text": "This week I had my small moment in the sun.  A thrill for any writer, I was invited for an interview on WNPR about my new novel, Qualities of Light.   I'd sent a copy of the book to WNPR in October, when the book was released, hoping but not expecting.  The email came in February--We're interested in interviewing you.  Yes!  I said.The host is a real expert at getting the story behind the story, no matter who she's talking with. Faith Middleton's show is in its twenty-ninth year, and it has won two Peabody Awards (broadcasting's equivalent of the Pulitzer). I've spoken on over 100 radio and TV programs in past years, for my other books, and it should've been a breeze.  But the novel felt much more personal, more risky to talk about. I prepared lots of notes, and even with all my experience, I was nervous as I drove to the studio in the rain that morning.  I'd heard wonderful things about Faith's warm and engaging style, but it didn't matter.  What if she asked me something weird?  Or, worse, criticized my book in front of all those invisible listeners?She asked me to sit across from her, in a cozy armchair.  I asked for a table for my notes, and she said I wouldn't need any.  Oh, boy, more jitters.   But her smile and obvious enjoyment of the process of our interview softened everything.  So did her first question:Tell us about the image or moment when you began this book.  Where were you, what were you doing?  Read more »"},

You may need to get a platform.What the heck is a platform?  Writers in my classes ask this question regularly.  Some are submitting their manuscripts and hear this back from agents they contact.  Platform used to mean something to stand on, a stage.  Now it means the place from which your book's message goes out into the world.Platforms are built over time and eventually let you be visible to a wider readership. They let people see you and hear you above the crowd. Not all writers--including me--feel comfortable with the idea of a platform at first. Can't we just write? Can't we just create something wonderful with words? Do we have to stand out? Platforms smack of being called a leader, an expert, someone who knows whereof she speaks. In my decades as a published author, I've sold lots of books without platforms. Books were based on my expertise (nonfiction) or my experience (memoir), and that was good enough. Three years ago, I sold my novel without any platform at all. The publisher fell in love with the story. But things have changed. I'm editing my next book, Your Book Starts Here, to be published later this year. It has propelled me into the world of platforms.Think of a Platform as a Solid Place for Your Book to StandA very wonderful agent gave me some great advice. Read more »"},

{"title": "Learning to Edit Your Own Writing", "date": "Friday, March 12, 2010", "text": "Painters carefully choose what to include, what to edit out. I learned this when I studied still life. You may see ten things but you focus on three because it makes the painting stronger.Same is true in writing. It's called editing. Do you know how to edit your own writing? Can you easily see what needs to stay, what needs to go? Can you tell when your tendencies, the places you go \"unconscious\" in your own work, take over, making the writing less strong and the writer more stubborn? In the final revision, do you have the detachment to let go of what's not working, even if you love it more than your first-born child?Editing is a craft. Trained editors are truly craftspeople in their work. When a writer is able to self-edit, that becomes an art and a craft. Art, because what emerges is often transformative to both writer and reader. Craft, because it requires practice, discipline, and appreciation for how it improves your work.My training as an editor came in the trenches of a small press in the midwest where I worked for eighteen years, and as I freelanced for other publishers throughout the U.S. as a book doctor. I learned the craft of editing different genres--what adult literary fiction demands, compared to a children's book, compared to a mystery or self-help or memoir. At the small press, a team of four very experienced editors suffered through my early years, as I learned ways to enhance, not erase, the original voice of the writer and bring out what the manuscript could be. As I learned to edit other people's manuscripts, I noticed my own writing improving. I began to publish more: essays, a short story here and there, my first books. I didn't really connect my editing training with my writing success until a publisher asked me if I worked as an editor, by any chance. \"I can always tell someone with editing background,\" she said. \"The writing they send me is so clean.\"Wow, I thought. Learning to edit means learning to write?Self-Editing ToolkitI began to put together a toolkit of techniques I used in editing, which might apply to my writing. This included my tendencies to expand or contract as a writer, where I went unconscious (usually during a highly emotional moment in the writing) and skipped over important details, where I was overwriting, where my love of sparseness got in the way of conveying a setting, where I explained too much of what was really obvious, where the pacing slowed too much or sped up and lost a reader.This toolkit was really valuable. In my workshops, I began teaching special sections on editing. I wanted to give writers a new understanding of their own \"unconscious areas\" and a new appreciation for editing tools as the solution.One of the favorite writing exercises, one that draws big \"ah-ha's\" from the class, is called Expansion/Contraction. It reveals, in very short time, where we get too expansive with our words, covering huge territory, and the reader loses track of the point. And where we are so careful with each sentence, crafting it so sparsely, that the story drops big pieces. It's different for each writer. This week's writing exercise shares part 1 of Expansion/Contraction. Next Sunday, March 28, I'll be teaching Self-Editing for Writers, the one-day workshop I developed from what I learned. I teach this workshop twice a year. It's going to be at the Loft Literary Center in Minneapolis, 11:00 a.m.-5:00 p.m., and it costs $78. There's still room. If you are serious about learning editing techniques, you may enjoy this workshop. More information below.This Week's Writing Exercise 1. Choose a paragraph of your writing. Read it aloud to yourself and find the one sentence that really is the essence of the paragraph for you--be it action, character, information, or setting. Now rework that one sentence until you have condensed the paragraph effectively. The writing won't be better; don't try to get that. It's just going to help you see where your paragraph's main punch might be. 2. Now do the opposite. Take that one sentence and expand it to two paragraphs. 3. Which was easier for you? Practice again, with another paragraph, whichever was harder. This tells you a bit about your tendencies as a writer--are you more comfortable expanding or contracting?Self-Editing for Book WritersA fast-paced, hands-on workshop to explore how to edit your own work, refining it from draft to final revision. We'll cover the art of pacing, line and structural editing, substantive editing (filling holes), and much more. You'll leave with a new perspective on your work and a toolbox full of essential techniques for getting a manuscript ready for publication or submission to agents and publishers. Bring 2 double-spaced pages of your manuscript or story/essay draft to use in the exercises. For all genres and skill levels.

{"title": "Discouragement as a Springboard into Higher Creativity", "date": "Sunday, March 7, 2010", "text": "It was a discouraging week for one of my writing classes.  We delved into a new level of information about books, and many writers crashed.I was deluged with emails after a few days--\"Help!\"  \"I'm lost/stuck/floundering.\"  \"Not sure I really want to write a book after all.\"  Big discouragement.Discouragement means losing heart, losing perspective, and it happens to all us writers, no matter how often we've been published.  It's a terrible moment when your work looks like dog meat, when you can't imagine how you're going to move forward, when you read other (wonderful) writers and sigh with the impossibility of being that good.  I got a couple of chapters back from a good editor in early January.  I had thought these newly revised chapters were almost there.  But my editor friend had much to suggest--and this was our third call-and-response session (I call out, she responds with edits).  She's so good, she sees so well what needs work, that although I felt the discouragement keenly for at least the length of a long car ride home after our meeting, I knew better than to give up.So I set about finding what was truth for me in her suggestions, and what she might be seeing that were my own blind spots and therefore invisible to me?Make a ListThe first thing I do with feedback that discourages or overwhelms me is make a list.  List-makers for generations, my family instilled in me the beauty of list-making as a way of getting perspective.  When faced with an onerous task, my mother made lists.  Revising for the twentieth time is certainly onerous, so when I got home I took a sheet of paper and listed my editor's main suggestions.It helped.  A lot.  As I listed them--the global changes, the smaller changes--I felt myself move into a different viewpoint.  I saw how 90 percent of her suggestions actually made the chapter flow much more smoothly for a reader.  My stomach felt better too.Perspective--Learning about Your Personal Learning CurveNext, I put the chapter away for a week.  I wanted to spend a little time away from the editing and get perspective (that word again) on my personal learning curve.  Where was I in the process of this manuscript?  I'd worked on it for four years, it had been through group and individual feedback, and I thought I was really there.  But she was telling me that from a reader's point of view, things were still jumbly.After a week I looked at it.  My God, she's right, I thought.  The temptation to get newly discouraged rose fast.  Why hadn't I seen those things myself!I reminded myself that blind spots are blind to us until we get perspective.  Then we see what we didn't see before.  Seeing new levels is a sign of growth, and growth is a good thing.  She'd pointed out what was not visible to me before, and now it was visible.  Lucky to have someone to help me see blind spots in my writing.  Lucky too that she'd given me practical steps to fix them.I went back to my list and began making the changes that made sense to me.  Some of them were so big they caused tremors throughout the chapter--lots had to be rearranged.  But I reminded myself that this was all good, this was all growth, and I wanted the chapter to be the very best it could be.How This Process Makes Us Better WritersAfter I corrected my chapter, I printed it out, got some Coconut Bliss, and let the chapter rest for an hour while I stared out the window and went into heaven with my bowl of ice cream.  Then I read it aloud.  Wow, was it better!  So much better, I was amazed.I felt grateful now, not discouraged.  And curious--would this learning translate into changed skill?  Would my attempt at the next chapter come out better because of what I'd just learned?This is the goal--you gain skill from good editing, from good feedback.  Yes, there's discouragement, losing heart, but there's also skill--if you keep on keepin' on.End of story:  The next chapter was indeed much better.  When I went back to work on its revision, I saw much of the same problems as my editor friend had caught.  Blind, but now I see.  And I did see, a lot more, which means my skills as a writer had increased via this path of discouragement.This Week's Writing ExerciseIf you can get some feedback on your writing this week, do.  Then try one of the techniques above.  Make a list.  Set the writing aside.  Have some ice cream.See if your learning curve isn't a springboard into higher creativity, in disguise."},
{"title": "Setting:  The Best Way to Get Emotion into Your Stories", "date": "Sunday, February 28, 2010", "text": "Author Annie Kelleher sent me a great question about setting in her upcoming mystery (she’s a well-published writer) set in the Florida Keys.“I’ve tried to be more mindful of adding in atmosphere,” she wrote me, “to heighten the sense of being in Key West, but one of the things that struck me when I visited the Keys was how familiar they seemed, how much like the Jersey Shore town I was born and raised in: the landscape, marshy and swampy and riddled with bays and inlets in South Jersey, has long encouraged all sorts of the same activities that take place in the Keys. “Even the architecture is similar,” she said, “and the tourist trade and the activities are all alike. How do I give the reader a sense of Key West while showing that, for my character, it feels so familiar?\"Setting Brings Out the EmotionSetting is what brings emotion to the reader. Dramatic action creates momentum, makes your book a page turner. Good characters well depicted and vivid on the page, linger in our memories long after the book is finished. But setting, the way you frame your story in physical time and space, generates the emotion. Seems counter-intuitive, doesn't it? But it's true. Just check it out in one of your favorite books--notice where the setting it, and what emotion is conveyed there.Even if you know a setting well, your reader won't. Even if the character knows the setting, from growing up there or visiting, your reader won't. So place us in space, time, weather conditions, hot and sultry or cool and breezy. Place us in the intense greens of summer or the black-and-white landscape of winter. Place us in the time of day, letting us experience the light slanting across the floor or the way the night wind rattles the windows.You can even mention the familiarity of it to the character, let us into that aspect. But we haven’t been there. Just like we’re not inside the writer’s head, we’re not yet inside the character’s either. So place us there, via how the character notices where she is, how it impacts her, what she sees and what she ignores.You can’t skip this step. Or else we won’t feel your story.Why Setting Delivers EmotionI worked for several years with a promising new novelist who was coming from a nonfiction background and trying to learn setting. In nonfiction, setting is used effectively in the anecdotes that illustrate ideas, theories, or methods—you’ve probably noticed the small stories that accompany a diet book or a book on repairing communication in your relationship. But setting is not primary in nonfiction. In fiction it is.This new novelist was stumped with setting. At first he thought it was just plug and play: rather stiff (his words) descriptions of breezes, sunlight, and birds injected into a scene willy-nilly. I asked him why these setting details were placed just then in his scene, and he couldn’t tell me. He was just trying to check “setting” off his writerly to do list. I explained that setting details must make sense with the moment when they are used. When his character, Jules, was struggling with a big decision, he might notice something in the setting that mirrored uncertainty. Not the clichéd dark and stormy night, but a small detail like a sweater buttoned the wrong way on an old man he’s talking to. Or shoes scattered in the front hall. A smoking pan on the stove. The idea was to use the setting to echo the character’s emotion. If Jules just thinks about his decision, it stays in his mind—and doesn’t reach the reader’s gut. If the setting, an objective part of the story, reflects Jules's indecision, the setting emphasizes what we’re supposed to be receiving from the scene.A small example. It really helped the writer.When Is Setting Too MuchYou choose your placement of setting details. Nobody rushing to a hospital will notice many setting details. Maybe two or three short bursts pass by, but not long paragraphs of it.Keep setting to where there’s a turning point, emotionally. Keep outer drama where you need momentum.Setting slows, drama speeds the pace.This Week’s Writing ExerciseUse the following checklist to help yourself enhance setting in a section of your writing where you want the reader to really get a punch of emotion. Choose three items and slip them in—not long sections but short (five to ten words) phrases.1. What does the narrator smell at this moment?2. What does the narrator feel on their skin at this moment? (air temperature, etc.)3. What does the narrator hear close up? In the distance?4. What three objects are in the room?5. What’s the time of day—morning, afternoon, late evening, night? How can the narrator tell via the setting (without a clock)?PS Be sure to visit Annie Kelleher's blog at http://anniekelleher.blogspot.com/."},

{"title": "Envision, Think, Dream, Refine:  The Four Steps to Manifesting", "date": "Monday, February 15, 2010", "text": "The process of manifesting a published book, whether seen from the starting gate or halfway to the finish line, demands a lot of trust.  We often don't know how to get over the blocks and open stretches ahead of us.  We hope that we are good enough writers with a good enough idea to make it to publication.What if you knew there were four measurable steps that successful book writers pass through?  Four steps that are far from magic, that don't demand unusual talent, that only ask for your belief and persistence to follow them. And if followed, result in a finished manuscript?I came across these four steps by trial and error.    And desperation.  And getting lost and frustrated and overwhelmed by my book projects time and again.But I'm a systems lover (as well as a creative person).  And after successfully publishing thirteen books in three genres, I suspected a system might exist that could help book writers overcome the overwhelm.I began looking for anything that dependably brought a book to the finish line.   Looking in my own writing notebooks to see what I'd done with my own books, interviewing other published writers, reading writing articles and craft guides.  What actually made the book journey  successful?  Was there any common experience between book writers, in any genre, who published their dreams?Successful Book Writers Use VisioningMost writers said they spent a lot of time, before they wrote much, just visioning the book. For some this didn't take place on paper.  Others took notes while musing over their book idea, jotting down ideas and images that came through the creative right brain.  Others discussed their ideas with friends and writing buddies, testing the waters (and this worked as long as the energy was not dissipated by the talking). But more than just jotting notes or talking, writers who succeeded with this step actually \"saw\" the book in their imaginations.  Some said they saw the book as a completed manuscript, a stack of papers on their desk.  Others saw it in published form, on a bookshelf.   In this step, the successful writers infused the journey ahead with confidence and belief in their project.It's an ancient principle:  As above, so below.  As you vision, so shall it be.  It's the basis for visualization, used in professions from sports to business.No surprise that successful book writers use it too.I love the visioning step of manifesting a book because it's so intensely internal and delightfully creative.  I spend time visiting bookstores, seeing what else is out there, imagining my book and how it will be different and unique and speak to the readers' need.   I also love drafting a mock cover of my book--complete with wished-for testimonials by famous writers.   Collage is great in this step (scroll down to see book collages from other writers in my post two weeks ago).  I also love writing a visioning statement for my book, asking myself,  What's this book about?Step Two:  Thinking It OutSuccessful authors often move directly from a solid vision to the action step of thinking.  Once the book is alive and breathing inside, then it's time to plan the journey.Planning feels very \"uncreative\" to many writers.  But books take planning, because they are so large.  Many writers spoke about planning including their research tasks, character sketches, drafts of scenes (also called \"islands\" or \"freewrites\"), or interviews.For me, a writing notebook is necessary now.  I use it to freewrite often, get deep into the idea of the book, try out ideas on paper.  While visioning can be done completely internally, planning begins to externalize the process of manifesting a book.  My goal during the planning step is to get my book thought out on paper, and create as much written material as possible so I have plenty of choices later.This step can take months, even years, depending on how much time a writer devotes to the book.Dreaming the Form There's a moment when the material grows so plentiful, it must become organized or insanity might result!  When a writer has so much written, then dreaming the form takes over.  This is a fun step, as the book starts to look like a real manuscript.I use storyboarding now, to pick and place, arrange and rearrange, until I have a good structure and can use that to cut and paste together a first draft. I'm looking for something that is still rough, but something that looks a bit like a book--it flows, it makes me proud or at least hopeful.Few published writers omit this step.  Many note that it's the place where manuscripts can feel like impossible journeys.  Sometimes this third step feels like slogging through thick sand.  But if the writer is persistant, the manuscript comes together.Dreaming is about structuring, accepting the need to organize the material you've generated so that it makes sense to someone outside your writing world.  The reader is very important in the dreaming stage--that's why I call it \"dreaming.\"  It's as if you are finally creating a world that can be entered fully and populated with witnesses who are also able to enjoy your story.Finally, RefiningMany published writers love this last step, refining.  I think it's the make-or-break moment for books.  If a writer has no love, skill, or tolerance for refining, the book doesn't usually make it to publication.Because refining can take up to 50 percent of the book journey, it helps to reach out for help during this step.  I get feedback from writing colleagues and good readers, even hired editors, to help me see with fresh eyes.Working as a WholeThese four steps are not separate from each other.  Often, they weave together as the writer journeys forward.  For instance, we revisit our visioning as the book shifts, as new ideas are explored midway through.  It's normal that creative work doesn't travel a straight path.  But it's also helpful to know approximately where you are in the journey at any one time.That way you have a sort of map which can orient you if you get overwhelmed, frustrated, or just plain lost.This week, take a look at your manuscript or writing project as a whole.  Think about where you are with these four steps.If you'd like, get out your writing notebook and dialogue with your book on paper.  Ask it where it thinks you are.  Write some notes to yourself about your next steps.PS  If you live in the Minneapolis-St Paul area, I'll be teaching this four-part process at my workshop, \"How to Plan, Write, and Develop a Book.\"  It's a two-day, very hands-on event held in the beautiful writing classrooms of the Loft Literary Center on Friday and Saturday, March 26-27.  For more information, visit www.loft.org or my website (look under Writing Classes) at www.marycarrollmoore.com.We stand with our players, the souls who populate our writing, and we think we know them pretty well as we write our books.  But do we?  What if we're not really listening deeply enough to know the story behind their stories?A reader from New York sent this wonderful comment:\"I was reading about one of my favorite subjects, something called Narrative Medicine. This is where doctors learn to listen receptively to their patients and frame their illnesses like a story. That means going beyond the clinical and getting into the whole person.\"And it struck me as curious that the techniques used in attentive listening, that docs are supposed to use to uncover their patients' stories, work because [these techniques] uncover what patients usually don't tell their docs.  Thus the idea.... why not apply that to fiction?\"Listen receptively to your characters to learn what they haven't told you. Receptive listening leads to the truth.\"Learning to Be a Better Listener to Be a Better WriterHow do you listen better in real life?How do you use the same skills to listen better in your writing?In real life,  a good listener puts all attention on the person speaking, looks the person in the eyes, reads body language for what's not being said, even repeats back to them what's being said so they know we're listening well.Most importantly, a good listener lets go of what they think they already know about this person--to be delightfully surprised, to let the speaker have the freedom to change.In writing, we use similar skills.  Full attention, repeating back, looking deeply.  But most importantly, getting past our own reactions or beliefs about our stories and the players in those stories.A challenge for many of us writers.  We know who these people are--maybe we grew up with them, if we're writing memoir.  We can predict every eyebrow twitch.Fiction writers get equally stubborn about \"knowing\" their characters.  \"She'd never do that!\" my students exclaim, when I ask about an idea to up the stakes in their novels.But our current view is often limited, gives the person no freedom to change, and occupies only one perspective.  So this week, try opening your perspective on your players, using the simple question I wonder...This Week's Writing Exercise1.  Pick somebody in your writing you'd like to get to know better.2.  Make a list of 10 things this person would never do.3.  Pick one item on the list.  Set a kitchen timer for 15 minutes.  Begin writing to answer this question:  I wonder what would happen if this person did this?  Let receptive listening begin.Remember this is just an exercise; you don't have to include this in your story.  In fact, you may not for many reasons.  But it will very likely let you get a new perspective on the player who has been hiding behind what you think you already know about him or her, and you'll hopefully be surprised at what you hear."},
{"title": "Remedies for Writer's Block--How I've Been Using My Storyboard to Break Through", "date": "Sunday, February 7, 2010", "text": "How you open your book determines whether it's read. What's opening your story right now? Is it compelling? Exciting, like a flower about to burst into bloom?This week my on-going book-writing classes at the Hudson Valley Writers' Center in Sleepy Hollow, NY, are working on this question. We're studying Act 1 of our books, asking ourselves if the opening chapter of Act 1 is strong enough.I like working with the three-act structure in books, because it makes the hugely unweildy manuscript more manageable. But it means doing a storyboard. If you've been reading this blog for the past weeks, you know my love-hate affair with storyboards. They force a writer to structure the story, to know what it's about. And the opening chapter stares you straight in the face.But the beauty of a storyboard is this: It is fluid, compared to an outline. Parts move around as you learn. Writers in my classes will bring in their storyboards this week and we'll rearrange stuff. Maybe chapter 5 will become chapter 1. Maybe the other way around.Inner Story Comes Through in a StoryboardStoryboards also reveal that serendipitous inner story. Inner story is the surprise element that emerges when we're not looking, and it's directly responsible for theme, voice, and elegance of manuscript--those memorable bits that delight both writer and reader. Inner story explores meaning versus event. Inner story can't be forced, and in my experience, outlines tend to make the book's structure rigid and hard to change, much as we want to.Storyboards are very successful because they are organic. They evolve. But you still have to decide what you're really writing about. That's the other beautiful aspect of storyboards. They make us choose.Choosing Act 1 ElementsYour storyboard of Act 1 should contain certain elements. If you look at three-act plays, at books that use a three-part structure, you'll see some very important elements in these opening chapters. From my study of Act 1, I've compiled a little list:1. Act 1 needs an opening that's strong enough to launch the rest of the book. It delivers the main question or quest of your book and make us want to read on.2. Act 1 also benefits from some parallel action or discussion or moment in its final chapter (say, chapter 7 or chapter 18). In other words, whatever you start in chapter 1 gets echoed in the final chapter of Act 1. This creates a very satisfying loop for the reader: we believe the writer is truly on the ball, because we recap what we've covered so far. Not in obvious ways, just as a parallel moment. For instance, letters received in chapter 1 of Act 1 could be revisited and then burned in the final chapter of Act 1.3. This final chapter of Act 1 must launch more trouble, a bigger question, to propel us to Act 2.4. It's helpful, especially if the book has multiple locations, time periods, or points of view in Act 1, to create a strong thread that runs through all of these, to hold all the chapters together. For instance, a recurring object in all chapters, or a metaphor or symbol.This Week's Writing ExerciseLine up seven Post-It notes on your desk. Close your eyes and drift into the creative imagination. Of all the ideas you have for your book so far, what's the strongest possible opening? Jot it on the first Post-It. Close your eyes and consider what possible ending for Act 1 would echo that first chapter idea. Jot it on the last Post-It.Now go back to your outline, storyboard, or book notes. Compare what you just came up with and the ideas you originally had for opening your book. Which is strongest?See if you can fill in the remaining Post-Its. Add more if needed. Then look at your storyboard. Sometimes this exercise results in surprising openings. And the storyboard changes. Make those changes--see how they feel this week. Do new doors open for you? Does writer's block disappear?"},

Making a collage, from bits of magazine photos and words and sketches and pretty much anything that can be glued onto paper, is a way I lift myself out of what I already know into what's possible.Two readers, Lynn and Carole, were inspired by a previous post on making a collage for your writing project.  Collaging your writing goals, dreams, focus, or questions can help clarify and bring in new energy.  Lynn and Carole said: Before we got started, we contemplated and then we talked--about what we'd both like to understand about our characters in our stories, what our purpose for writing the story would be, things like that. Collages tend to take on a life of their own sometimes but it's always great fun and a nice reminder afterward to look at for inspiration.They gave me permission to share their collages with you.Here's Lynn's:  And here's Carole's:See what variation there is, how free each collage is, how beautifully it speaks of individual creativity.  Can you take on the assignment this week?  Get together with a writing buddy.  Bring some magazines, posterboard, glue or rubber cement, colored pencils, scissors.Your Weekly Writing ExerciseOnce you've created a collage, try the exercise below.  It's great fun and oh-so-revealing about your writing project.It comes from writer Sheila Asato of Monkey Bridge Arts, (her website is www.monkeybridgearts.com), who passed along some wonderful questions she uses to ask about collage.I've taken Sheila's ideas and developed them specifically for book writers.  When you've finished your collage, ask yourself:1.  Is there a pathway in my collage, a beginning point and ending point?  If so, how do these relate to the beginning of my story and the possible ending?2.  Squint at the collage and find the place with most contrast, which jumps out at you.  Ask yourself how it might reflect the highest moment of tension in your book, or the question that remains unanswered, or the unmet challenge your book speaks of.3.  Look at the types of pictures you chose.  What are they, mostly--images of people, places, animals, landscapes, buildings, the ocean, the sky, abstracts?  How does this predominant type of image tell you something about your book's main focus, the aspect you feel most comfortable with?Send your writing collages, your questions, and I'll post the ones I can!"},
{"title": "How to Survive Writing a Book--The Blessing of Short Assignments", "date": "Monday, January 25, 2010", "text": "Finding a pathway through your book project can seem impossible at times.  You haven't a clue where you're going, and what seemed like a solid outline or storyboard can shift completely, right in the middle of writing.Despair sets in.  Sometimes writer's block.  Often overwhelm.  How does a book writer survive?First, we accept that books are organic in nature.  They must change as they evolve.  The best books always surprise their writers.  A teacher once said to me, If the writer isn't surprised, the reader won't be either. But there's still the factor of overwhelm and how to deal with it.  My answer comes from years as a syndicated columnist:  short assignments.The Beauty of Short AssignmentsWhen I was a columnist for the Los Angeles Times syndicate, I produced 600 words each week.  Writing became a job in those years, not a romance.  I had a firm deadline, I got a paycheck for it, and no excuses were accepted by my boss.  I couldn't blow my deadline off even once, or I'd lose my precious slot in the Times lineup.  So I did it.Back then, I wasn't used to short assignments.  Six hundred words was really hard to work with.   So much to say, so little space on the page.Over the years, I learned to love the beauty of short assignments.  Most times, they reduced any overwhelm.  They cancelled out writer's block.I use short assignments to survive writing books.  I break my books into small sections, most often three acts.  Since it's impossible to keep THE BOOK as a whole in my head, working on each act individually keeps overwhelm at bay.Short Assignments Show the Pathway ThroughMy current novel-in-progress is called Breathing Room.  It's the sequel to Qualities of Light, which was published in October.  Breathing Room is a much more difficult story. It's much easier to get overwhelmed.Three point-of-view main characters rotate by chapter. It's very easy for me to lose track of the individual stories, much less weave them together into a coherent whole.So I broke the story into three acts.  Working with three acts is the perfect short assignment.  You focus only on one third of the book, making that act like a complete book in itself, with a beginning, middle, and end, but you create a sudden new beginning again in the final chapter. In other words, act one seems to take us to a nice settled plateau, but it really ends up raising the stakes.  That propels the reader into act two.  Get it?It works beautifully in playwriting. I'm finding it works equally well in novels, memoirs, and other genres of books.  I'm also using it on a nonfiction book I'm writing about how to write a book.  I use a series of key questions, to keep me within my short assignment of each act:1.  Is the storyline for each character tracking well just within this part of the book? 2.  Is the triggering event, what starts each person on their individual journey, exciting and dramatic?3.  Does each person go to some new place during act one?4.  What dramatic event ups the stakes at the end of act one, for each person and the group as a whole? 5.  What main threads hold the three stories together?  How do they intersect via theme, objects that repeat, places that echo in all three stories?But it's important to give it all you can.  Not hoard the best for later. To Make a Short Assignment Work, Give It All You GotI was sitting in the library Sunday afternoon, stuck in the final chapter, when I noticed I was holding back.  No wonder my character, Mel, was feeling moody and blah on the page.  He wouldn't risk anything, and I didn't want to use my \"really great\" scenes to propel his story into act two.Then I asked myself, why was I saving these for later in the book?  Within this short assignment of act one, or chapter 18 in particular, I needed to give it all I had.  So I took an idea from later in the book, inserted it in the chapter, and let it up the stakes for Mel. From that, three other ideas came forward.  They grew into surprising new scenes, right on the spot. The \"saved\" idea actually fit much more successfully into act one. When you work in short assignments, don't hoard the best stuff for later. The present is much more important than the future.Your Weekly Writing Exercise--Two Options1.  Practice short assignments this week.  How can you break THE BOOK into manageable bites?2.  Divide your book project into three acts.  Use the questions above to analyze whether each act has enough energy.  Then, using your storyboard or outline, see what you can rearrange to up the stakes."},
{"title": "Pacing through Paragraphs", "date": "Sunday, January 17, 2010", "text": "Imagine standing in a forest.  This photo is from our family trip to see the California redwoods.  Magnificent doesn't even describe them.  Each is so different.  They are naturally unique. A writer's job is to bring out that kind of uniqueness in her or his own work.  This comes from several arenas:  content, meaning, voice, and pacing being a few.Judith Hendin, PhD, author of the excellent book The Self behind the Symptom:  Accessing the Healing Gold of Shadow Voices, asked me to help her with the editing of her latest revision.  I'm a big fan of Judith's work, and her writing, so I was glad for the chance.  I first looked at her material in terms of content, meaning, voice, and pacing.  Judith's content is strong--she knows her material and she communicates her points very well.  In earlier drafts, we worked together to add meaning to some of the examples she uses.  It wasn't hard to adjust or add a sentence here and there to make the example more universal for the reader.  Voice is already present; she uses interesting words and ideas and makes them her own.Our last and biggest challenge was pacing.  I suggested many pacing changes on her final draft last month, and when I returned it to her, she emailed me with a very good question.  \"I have just finished incorporating your edits,\" she wrote. \"They were wonderful, so clear and helpful. I greatly appreciate that you read the entire manuscript. Can I ask you one question? In a number of places, you suggested making a new paragraph. I love the effect. Can you articulate how I can think about that in future writing?  You know me, I love to learn.\"I asked her if I could use her excellent question as a launch for this week's writing exercise, and she graciously agreed.  I hope you'll check out Judith's new book at her website. Paragraphs--How They Create PacingWhen I first started working professionally as an editor, I had good instincts about pacing. From being a passionate reader and a fairly experienced writer, I knew intuitively when a page bogged down from too-slow flow, when it moved too fast for a reader to keep up.  I saw a few ways to correct the pace mechanically.  Here are some easy ones:1.  Change sentence lengths.  When you want a tenser, faster pace, use short sentences.2.  Change word choice.  Use short words to get faster pace, longer words to slow things down.3.  Add in more description when you want the reader to linger or absorb more emotion.4.  Use dialogue to speed things up.5.  Use dialogue to reveal character and heighten emotional tension between people.After a few years of working intensively with these basic pacing tools, I began to notice paragraphs.A really good editor is the best training a writer can have, in my experience.  For eighteen years, I worked with a team of really good editors at a small press in the Midwest.  One of them was savvy about paragraphs and began training the rest of us.  Here's what I learned.Most writers are ridiculously unconscious about paragraph length.  We find a rhythm, a pulse that feels good, and we repeat it.  Over and over.   For instance, five line paragraphs.  In many manuscripts, page after page of five-line (or four- or three-line) paragraphs are unconsciously churned out from a writer's mind.Result?  Sleepy pace.  No matter what excitement is happening, the same old stuff creates a sleepy rhythm.  Imagine a symphony orchestra playing the same phrase for three hours.  You get the feeling of drone?  The visual rhythm of white space and text on a page imprints on a reader's mind and creates a strong effect that can overshadow the actual meaning of the writing.Remedy?  Vary your paragraph length.  Break 'em up.  A lot!Breaking Up with MeaningHow do you to start breaking up your sleepy rhythms?First, print out a chapter of your work.  Lay the pages on the table.   Squint at them.  Study the patterns of white space and text.  Do you see any similar sections?  Now, be ruthless.  Go in and change them, make them long here, short here.  Five lines here, two here, seven there.But break up your paragraphs consciously, designing it for the effect you want from your words.  Short paragraphs, such as one liners, will have the effect of a tiny stop sign in the middle of your page.  The reader will take notice.  So choose well.Let's take this quote from writer John Fowles, mess up the paragraphs a bit, and see what difference it makes in the writing.OriginalYou have to distinguish two kinds of writing: most important is first-draft writing, which to an extraordinary degree is an intuitive thing—you never quite know when you sit down whether it’s going to come or not, and you get all kinds of good ideas from nowhere. They just come between one line and the next.Changed for Different EffectYou have to distinguish two kinds of writing: most important is first-draft writing, which to an extraordinary degree is an intuitive thing—you never quite know when you sit down whether it’s going to come or not, and you get all kinds of good ideas from nowhere.They just come between one line and the next.Doesn't make it better, perhaps.  Who am I to argue with John Fowles's placement of his paragraphs?  But it changes the effect.  The singled-out sentence, the new paragraph, becomes more emphatic.  The reader pauses longer on this one, digests it differently.This Week's Writing ExerciseTry two things this week, using two pages of your own writing.1.  Print out the pages and use the squint test--see where you've fallen into unconscious rhythms in your writing.2.  Mess up a few paragraphs.  See what effect you get, what different pacing happens, what tension and interest heightens."},

{"title": "Quotes to Inspire Writers", "date": "Monday, January 4, 2010", "text": "A writing friend, Jean Sands, author of the newly released book of poems, Gandy Dancing, sent round a lovely collection of quotes from writers and others to inspire us as we begin our new year.  Jean gave me permission to share them.(Check out her new poetry book at www.antrimhousebooks.com)This week's writing exercise is to choose one of the quotes below and write for 15-20 minutes about what it means to you.  If you're writing a novel, have one of your characters discuss it or think about it.Quotes to Inspire Writers“Out of the artist’s imagination, as out of nature’s inexhaustible well, pours one thing after another. The artist composes, writes or paints just as he dreams, seizing whatever swims close to his net.” John Gardner  “The novelist’s imagination has a power of its own. It does not merely invent, it perceives. It intensifies, therefore it gives power, extra importance, greater truth, and greater inner reality to what well may be ordinary and everyday things.” Elizabeth Bowen  “Before you begin to write a sentence, imagine the scene you want to paint with your words. Imagine that you are the character and feel what the character feels. Smell what the character smells, and hear with that character’s ears. For an instant, before you begin to write, see and feel what you want the reader to see and feel.” Othello Bach  “Poetic value is an intrinsic value. It is not the value of knowledge. It is not the value of faith. It is the value of the imagination.” Wallace Stevens  “The truth seems to be that we live in concepts of the imagination before the reason has established them. If this is true, then reason is simply the methodizer of the imagination.” Wallace Stevens  “In literature, you know only what you imagine.” Carlos Fuentes  “You put yourself apart from yourself, and you enter the imaginary world.” Andrew Lytle  “The realm where the narrative you are working with becomes true and alive for you.” Madison Smartt Bell  “The composition of fiction can, at least theoretically, be broken into two stages. First, and most important, comes imagination. Next is rendering. Imagination is no more or less than a highly structured form of daydreaming. Daydreaming is fun, a form of play. Once the people, the places, the events you are imagining become fully present to your senses, then it’s time for rendering. . . . to express your vision in language.” Madison Smartt Bell  “I do find something distressingly amoral in the very nature of film and TV—possibly because the photographic image denies the spectator virtually all use of his own imaginative powers. Whereas reading requires a constant use of the reader’s imagination.” John Fowles   “The artist’s imagination, or the world it builds, is the laboratory of the unexperienced, both the heroic and the unspeakable.” John Gardner  “It [imagination] is the one thing beside honesty that a good writer must have. The more he learns from experience the more truly he can imagine. If he gets so he can imagine truly enough people will think the things he relates all really happened and that he is just reporting.” Ernest Hemingway  “The real man, the imagination.” William Blake  “There is something in the nature of nature, in its presentness, its seeming transience, its creative ferment and hidden potential, that corresponds very closely with the wild, or green man, in our psyches.” John Fowles  “The writer’s sole authority is his imagination. He works out in his imagination what would happen and why, acting out every part himself, making his characters say what he would say himself if he were a young second-generation Italian, then an old Irish policeman, and so on. When the writer accepts unquestioningly someone else’s formulation of how and why people behave, he is not thinking but dramatizing some other man’s theory: that of Freud, Adler, Laing, or whomever. Needless to say, one may make some theory of motivation one’s premise—an idea to be tested. But the final judgment must come from the writer’s imagination.” John Gardner  “A strong imagination makes characters do what they would do in real life. A subtler work of the imagination—a subtler way in which the writing of fiction is a morally serious mode of thought—is symbolic association.” John Gardner  “The bad writer may not intend to manipulate; he simply does not know what his characters would do because he has not been watching them closely enough in his mind’s eye—has not been catching the subtle emotional signals that, for the more careful writer, show where the action must go next.” John Gardner  “The imagination sees with the eyes of the spirit; the maker, finished with his making, must then see what he has done, like the reader, with corporeal eyes.” Guy Davenport  “Romantic theory: the imagination, wellspring of compassion, is an innate faculty but one which requires exercise and training.” John Gardner  “The intellect has withdrawn its watchers from the gates, and the ideas rush in pell-mell, and only then does [the creative mind] review and inspect the multitude.” Schiller  “Ridiculous little parakeet faced woman; but not quite sufficiently ridiculous. I kept wishing for superlatives; could not get the illusion to flap its wings.”  Virginia Woolf  “I began the making up of scenes—unconsciously: saying phrases to myself; and so, for a week, I’ve sat here, staring at the typewriter and speaking aloud phrases of The Pargiters.” Virginia Woolf   “Elvira and George, or John, talking in her room. I’m still miles outside them, but I think I got into the right tone of voice this morning.” Virginia Woolf  “A novel, as we say, opens a new world to the imagination.” Percy Lubbock  “All literary and dramatic enjoyment, whether of nursery tales in childhood or of moving pictures later on or of ‘great literature,’ appears to involve to some degree the reader’s imaginative identification of himself with the roles portrayed and his projection of himself into the situations described in the story. (At what age does the capacity for imaginative identification of oneself with the roles portrayed in a story begin? The writer would suggest, on the basis of very limited observation, that it begins around the age of two or earlier. An interesting test case is to read the story of the Three Bears to a very small child to see when he begins to identify himself with Baby Bear.)” S.I. Hayakawa  “The first conception of the work needs intuition and imagination more than the craftsman’s toolbox, and so does the final consummation.” Madison Smartt Bell  “The landscape that opens before the critic is whole and single; it has passed through an imagination, it has shed its irrelevancy and is compact with its own meaning. Such is the world of the book.” Percy Lubbock  “Safety is a crime writers should never commit unless they are after tenure or praise.” Pat Conroy  “Don Quixote does not invite us into ‘reality’ but into an act of the imagination where all things are real.” Carlos Fuentes  “If the writing is any good, it struggles free of you, and the feeling of being inside it just as it moves away is so brief; a sensual visitation, the brush of His hand.” Jayne Anne Phillips  “Throughout time great writers have always been able to transpose themselves imaginatively into not just the racial other, but the sexual other and also into other historical periods.” Philip Gerard  “I think you will agree that the good lasting stuff comes out of one individual’s imagination and sensitivity to and comprehension of the suffering of Everyman, Anyman, not out of the memory of his own grief.” William Faulkner -  written in a letter to Richard Wright"},
{"title": "New Year's Resolutions for Writers--What Do You Want for Your Creativity This Year?", "date": "Sunday, January 3, 2010", "text": "Traditionally, at this time of year, I like to set some goals for my writing.  Winter, when things are stripped bare, makes it easier to see what I really want from my creative life.I found inspiration this week from teacher and writer Emily Hanlon, creator of The Fiction Writer's Journey and Creative Soul Works.  Visit her website at www.emilyhanlon.com. Emily sent out these wonderful new year's resolutions for writers.   They also fueled this week's writing exercise.Emily's resolutions are very inspiring because they locate the adventure and joy of writing rather than the production of pages or books or published articles.  Her resolutions include (and as she notes, these are in no particular order):1. I write for the passion and adventure of the journey.2. Writing comes from my heart and the fire in the belly.3. Writing is a craft. Craft supports writing, it does not define it.4. I love my first draft writing for its fertility and uncovered gems.5. I welcome the unexpected in my writing.6. I will not think about being published until the piece is finished.7. I go where my imagination takes me.8. I will set up a writing schedule that supports, not defeats, my writing. Discipline is a necessary part of being a writer, but I will not use failure to keep to my schedule as a reason to give up.9. I will write the story that is gestating within me – even if it scares me or makes me think I am losing my mind.10. When I begin a new piece, I will begin without thinking, without planning.How often do New Year's resolutions focus on the qualities of the writing experience, not the results?  It's very refreshing.   And accurate to my own experience.  Goals set as qualities are much more likely to manifest.  They make it easier to enjoy your writing journey.They also tend to create better writing.  Why?Goals That Loosen Us Up--Rather Than Put Us in a Box--Work BestWhen writers put all of their attention on publishing rather than the creation of something unique that expresses their truths and journey, they tighten inside.  It's a great road to writer's block.  But when writers put attention on the qualities of their journey, what they want as an experience, it opens them up creatively.  Magic happens.This week's exercise helps you loosen up your writing goals.  You'll be crafting a few New Year's resolutions for your creativity.  The exercise can be done over a series of days, as you think of something to add to your goal list, or in one session of about 20 minutes.  Have pen and paper or your writer's notebook or computer at hand.This Week's Writing ExerciseClose your eyes, relax, and imagine yourself a year from now. Project yourself into the future.Focusing on your creative life as a writer, ask yourself:What qualities are in place with my writing that have come about during 2010?Maybe you trust the process more, maybe you created good writing habits, maybe you manifested a supportive writing group or partner.   Begin to list these qualities, as if you are at the end of the year looking back.  List anything that comes to mind, using Emily's ideas above, thinking about what's lacking in your writing life, dreaming some writing dreams, or even polling your writing friends about their goals to get some ideas.Here are some questions to get you started:What would you like to feel by the end of 2010 about your writing journey?What changed with your creativity?What did you learn--new skills, new habits, new ideas?What manifested for you?This exercise is fun, if you let yourself travel forward in time and use the visualization to create a new experience for yourself.  It may bring you an unexpectedly fertile new year--your most creative, fulfilling one ever!"},
{"title": "Why Bad Decisions Make Good Stories--A Cure for Writer's Block", "date": "Friday, December 11, 2009", "text": "Still life--it doesn't make for good stories.  Bad decisions?  They do.A friend from Florida just emailed me a list of random thoughts, truisms to laugh at or shake your head over.  Here's the one that grabbed me for this week's writing exercise:  \"Bad decisions make good stories.\"  Funny, but really accurate.  A good motto for writers.Bad decisions are one of the only ways plot is furthered in memoir and fiction.  If you're stuck in a rut, chances are your writing is staying too safe.  This week's discussion and exercise looks at a simple question.  Why are you keeping bad decisions out of your book? Staying SafeA student in my classes complained about her writer's block.  She wrote several chapters that just flowed out.  Then, about chapter 5, she got stuck.  Nothing happened--either on the page or with the pen.  I suggested she look at the bad decisions in her chapters.  Try to find something that made everyone uneasy or got them into trouble. What you're after here are the qualities of risk.  What does the edge feel like?  What does it feel like to \"up the stakes\" in your writing?This writer was working on her storyboard (see post two weeks ago) so she went back to it.  As she reviewed the plot points, she realized nothing big had happened.  She was saving the big stuff for later.  No bad decisions yet, so very little momentum.  Very little energy to propel the plot.I asked her why not.  As she explained, I saw that this writer is a very nice person.  She believes in a world where most people are good at heart.  She just couldn't see getting her characters in trouble, painting them as anything but good people too.I like her, who wouldn't?  And I also believe in that kind of world.  But not on paper.  Not in fiction or memoir, especially if you want to publish today. I'm not suggesting you have to make murder and mayhem.  Bad decisions can just be telling a white lie, and watching the consequences unfold.  I asked this writer if she'd ever told a white lie, and she said, \"Of course, who hasn't?\" \"Find your bad decisions,\" I suggested.  \"List them, then transport one into your story.\" Finding Bad Decisions--This Week's Writing ExerciseWe've all made bad decisions.   We've been on the receiving end of other people's, too. They are hard to forget, no matter how hard we try.   Think of what your \"story\" was after the decision.  It probably had drama, movement, energy, and consequences.  That's what you're after in your writing.This week write about one really bad decision you made in your life.  Write about it in all its glory.  I like to set a kitchen timer for 15 minutes, to limit the agony.  Maybe you're far enough away to not feel the pain of it again, but if you do feel some embarrassment or unease as you write, good thing--because it'll make the writing that much more emotionally grabbing for a reader.Now look at your book draft.  Where are the bad decisions?  If you don't have many, make a list of 10 things your character would never do.  (Use this equally for memoir or fiction.)  Now write one scene, one moment, using one item on the list--imagining it happening.  See if this provides momentum.  Gets you unstuck.  Out of that \"still life.\"PS  We'll carry this one step further next week, with an update on storyboards.  I've been learning a lot as I work on my novel's sequel, and I'm feeling far from stuck now--hooray!"},
{"title": "Working with Unsavory Characters", "date": "Wednesday, December 9, 2009", "text": "A reader recently posted this excellent question: \"I have many stories in which the characters are not easily appreciated. I am sure many of my stories will be filled with hints of resentment, bitterness and disdain. Many players acted badly, and hurt the lives of many people. I guess forgiveness is due, but the facts are the facts. How do I deal with that?\"Another reader wrote me the same week, very disappointed in the ending of a popular thriller which let the bad guys triumph. Why'd the author do that? he wondered. Such a let down, after a great story.So here we have the same dilemma, from both sides.What do you do, as a writer, when one or more of your characters is not very likeable (at best) or downright horrible (at worst)? You'll be spending time with this person. A negative character isn't like a downward turn of plot. Plot changes. People often do, but they don't always, especially if their nastiness is part of who they are.And how does a negative character affect a reader? Will they stop following your story, or will they read to the end and be so disgusted, they won't want to recommend your book to anyone?An Example from Tobias WolffTobias Wolff wrote a fabulous short story called \"Bullet in the Brain.\" I teach this story in one of my one-day workshops because it's complex, amazing, and gives writers so much information on working with unsavory characters.Wolff presents a character, Anders, who is thoroughly despicable. So much so that he gets himself killed halfway through the story. But the way Wolff continues the story, revealing Anders beneath the anger, boredom, and frustration that makes him a really bad guy, is brilliant.We end the story actually feeling the depths of humanness, even in this miserable person.  How is this possible?  How does the process work, for the writer, while he or she is putting the story together?My Challenge with MelvinMelvin Fisher is the main male character in my novel Qualities of Light. He's the first character that \"came\" to me, nine years ago, and was the subject for a short story published many years before the novel. Melvin was a pest; he didn't let me stop writing about him, even though I grew to really dislike him.He's everything you don't want in a friend or relative: self-absorbed, terrifically talented but pretty mean-spirited about it, short with loved ones, a betrayer at his worst. A painter, who hasn't actually had affairs, Melvin falls in love with his models and does everything but sleep with them. Somehow he believes this is OK, justified by his need to \"absorb beauty.\"Bleech. My writing groups, three of them over the years Melvin has haunted me, agree. The first one actually told me they really didn't want to hear more Melvin scenes until he got nicer.So what's a writer to do?I would've dumped Melvin like a bad lunch date if he hadn't presented some interesting writerly problems for me. I needed to learn how to make him less evil. In other words, if my basic belief in life and in writing is that human beings have many sides, not just bad or good, where was Melvin's compassion, beauty, shades of gray? Could I show him as vulnerable, learning and growing? Who in my story would help me do this?It turned out to be Molly, his teenage daughter. She saves the entire family in Qualities of Light, but mostly she saves her dad. From himself.One reader told me, \"I loved your book, and by the end I even got to like Melvin.\" That was my biggest complement.This Week's Exercise: Write a \"Good\" Bad CharacterFind someone bad in your story, be it a real person or a fictional one, and interview them on paper. Pretend you are a very skilled interviewer who knows how to get to the truth about someone. First ask them what bad stuff they've done. Get them to be specific--who have they cheated, lied to, stolen from, or worse? Then begin asking them about good stuff they've done--even small.Finally ask your character about their missed chances, their longings, what they wanted from life but never got. Go beneath their bitterness if you can, into the innocence they once had.If you can, get ahold of \"Bullet in the Brain\" (search for it online, or better, get ahold of the short-story collection--you'll love Wolff's other stories too).  Read it as a writer, asking yourself how Tobias Wolff allows us to see a bad character in a good light.The ending lines are particularly important, so pay attention, but don't read ahead. It's a great surprise."},
{"title": "What Makes Strong Writing?  Something to Think about as You Work on Your Book", "date": "Monday, December 7, 2009", "text": "How does a book writer create writing that pulls a reader in, that engages us so well, we can't stop reading?  A favorite nonfiction writer, Malcolm Gladwell, spoke about this in the preface to his book What the Dog Saw and Other Adventures.Gladwell's topics are potentially dry.  I love his ability to present his material in an amazingly engaging way.\"Good writing does not succeed or fail on the strength of its ability to persuade,\" he said.  \"It succeeds or fails on the strength of its ability to engage you, to make you think, to give you a glimpse into someone else's head--even if in the end you conclude that someone else's head is not a place you'd really like to be.\"Each book writer has their topic, the thing they must write about.  Some write about flowers, some write about addictions. No matter your topic, the trick is to make it engaging.  It's harder than it sounds.  The key is something called \"container.\"On Sunday I taught a one-day workshop at the Loft Literary Center in Minneapolis called \"Self-Editing for Book Writers.\" We spent all day on this question:  How does a book writer move from the writer's view to the reader's?  How do we get the reader engaged in our work?  It usually happens in the crafting stage, or editing stage.  In the class, I guide writers through a series of exercises that let them move to the reader's chair, instead of the writer's.This is the first step to producing the engaging writing that Gladwell is talking about.Tough Material, Great ContainerIn the class, we read an essay by Susan J. Miller, excerpted from her book Never Let Me Down. Miller's father was a well-respected jazz musician who hung out with the likes of George Handy and Stan Getz. But he was also a heroin addict, and her life was terribly affected by this.  Her memoir is heart-breaking. Some of the class members were really repulsed by the essay.  Some couldn't even finish it. Others loved it. No one was nuetral.  We had a lively debate, trying to understand why the essay affected us so much.In the end, we concluded it was because of her extraordinary \"container,\" the living environment of her story.Container Equals EmotionThis is the key to engaging writing.  Container, the enviroment of your book's story, delivers more emotion than plot, characters, topic, structure, or all of these combined. \"It's counter-intuitive,\" said one class member.  You would think that good plot, exciting action, would create emotional response.   Good plot creates momentum.  It drives the story forward.  Container creates emotional response.  It's what makes us feel hit in the gut by a story's tender moment or feel our hearts racing with anticipation by a twist.  Without container, plot is just a series of events, like a newspaper report.   Why else would I, as a reader, become so engaged in the healing of a crime-ridden neighborhood, the comeback of Hush Puppy Shoes, and other examples from Gladwell's book, The Tipping Point?  I don't care about Hush Puppies.  Really.  But I did when he talked about them.  Same with Susan Miller's work.  Heroin addiction is not on my list of fun things to read about.  But I was totally engrossed by her tale.Because both Gladwell and Miller are masters of writing container.How Is Container Presented?Container is presented in writing in several ways. Here are a few from just one paragraph of Miller's essay:1. physical setting (being on a speeding subway train, watching the night flash by outside the grimy windows)2. use of the five senses (screech of train wheels, whisper of her father's voice against her ear)3. physical sensations (the rocking of a train causing nausea, felt in the body)4. word choice (\"screech\" and \"whisper\" echo the sounds of jazz being played--Miller's overall container for the essay)5. paragraph length and flow (a series of clauses, separated by commas, giving the impression of movement and jerkiness while on the subway train)The effect of this paragraph--one where her father takes her on a train ride then gleefully whispers that he just dropped acid--is one of terror. A young girl is aware that her father might at any moment decide the train car is a tomb and try to jump off. What can she do? Not much. She just has to ride out the ride.It's an astonishing container.This Week's ExerciseChoose a dead spot in your writing--a paragraph or a page. Insert one of the above tools to increase container. See if you can let go of your preferences as a writer and be willing to see your work from the reader's view. Does more emotion come through?"},
{"title": "A New Way to Do a Storyboard for Your Book", "date": "Sunday, November 29, 2009", "text": "I really dislike storyboards.  They tell me what I don't want to know--where I have too much or too little, where I've written on track or on a tangent.  Where my book isn't yet working well.A writer needs to know placement in time and space--where things will be, in her book.  It's not just enough to flow out the words.  You need to have a sequence that readers can follow.  Storyboards provide this.  They are used a lot in publishing and the film industry. Imagine a giant blank cartoon--a row of empty boxes lined up on a page or wall or posterboard.  You insert ideas, then you move the boxes around until the sequence of ideas equals a reasonable flow for your book. What you learn:  All the things I grumbled about above.  What is working, yes.  Also what is not working.  It's not uncommon to emerge from a storyboarding session with many blank boxes.  Stuff you know you need to write, transition chapters or sections.  Research still to do.  It's also not uncommon to feel discouraged.  All that writing done, but it's not yet a book.  Sigh.Why even bother?  Storyboards are the absolute best way I've found to see if I have a working book, to force myself to structure the flow of ideas, to see what's left.  I usually get kind of squirrely (imagine a squirrel twitching in agitation) when I have written too much to really see my book anymore.  When I get squirrely, I know it's time to storyboard.After the Meltdown, Even though I Really Hate Doing It...If you read my pre-Thanksgiving post below, you know I had a nice little meltdown after my recent book tour, when I got back home and tried to storyboard my next novel, the sequel to Qualities of Light. It just didn't track--the new book's flow, that is.  Too many dramas, too many characters, not enough cohesion.  So I rescued myself from myself by putting the storyboard aside and making a character plot chart for each of the three main players.  After screaming under the covers for a while.That plot chart was fun.  It reminded me how much I love Molly and Zoe and Kate and Anna and Sammy and even bad-tempered Melvin, my continuing characters.  From the plot chart, I began to approach storyboarding again.   I did it a new way this time.  I went to Staples and bought a foam core posterboard, clean and white.  And three colors of Post-It notes.  My main players are Molly, Kate, and Melvin.  A different color for each.  Using my plot chart, I wrote Post-It notes for the beginning and ending boxes.  The plot chart had told me where I want each of these three characters to begin their story and where I want them to end.  Then I began to imagine what could go in the other boxes.This was very different from past approaches to storyboarding.  I pretended I hadn't written anything (I've written about 100,000 words already) and let myself take the three stories wherever I wanted.  New ideas came through--better ones than I'd already written scenes for.When they were laid out on the storyboard in their rows of boxes, I saw very nice connections between the three characters' individual plots, as well.Then, Back to the ManuscriptI liked what I created.  But there were 100,000 words waiting to be used, if possible, and I'm too economical to toss everything and start over.  So my next step was printing out my manuscript pages, in all their rough and raw glory.So many errors, I winced when I read it over.  So I tried not to.  I just scanned each chapter, each island, each section.  I thought about where it might be placed on the new storyboard.60 percent of the pages made it.  They fit nicely, they filled in blanks.  Some will be heavily reworked or repositioned in time.  But I can do that now; I know what goal I'm shooting for.The rest?  They go into my \"extras.doc\" file. I created the extras.doc file when I was working on Qualities of Light.  The extras file was about 30,000 words at its peak, but almost all of the pages got used in Qualities of Light's revision.  Sometimes an idea or setting, only.  But little was wasted.My new storyboard is complete.  I finally have a working map for my next book.This Week's Writing ExerciseThis week, get yourself to an office supply store.  Buy a posterboard and some Post-It notes.  Go home, take a deep breath, and try creating two boxes on a storyboard:  just the opening and ending moments of your book.First ask yourself:  Where will you begin?  What moment do you see launching your reader into your topic or story?  Write a note about this on a Post-It and place it on the storyboard.Then, what moment ends your book?  Where would you like the reader to be at the last page--with what new understanding, hunger, idea or feeling?  Write a note about this too.If you get brave, if you get enthused--as I did--see how many of the other boxes you can fill."},

{"title": "Finding Your Story's Pathways--The Art of Rethinking What Your Book Is About", "date": "Monday, November 16, 2009", "text": "Today I had plenty of creative energy, so I decided to tackle a big project:  storyboarding my new novel.  It's the sequel to Qualities of Light, which was published this fall.  I've been working on this sequel for five years and I love the story, but it's gotten complicated.  Three characters, three separate plot lines.  In desperate need of a storyboard.I've taken this new book through NaNoWriMo twice, so I have a decent first draft.  I just haven't tested the draft for logical flow.  Which is the purpose of a storyboard.So I set about it.  Got tea, a piece of homemade pie, and closed the door to my little office.  Began to note the main points for each chapter and the islands (separate dramatic scenes) within each chapter.  Arc them on a flow chart as a series of cartoon boxes.  Test their track.They didn't.  Track, that is.  Boring, boring, boring.The critic got real happy.  \"You're a one-novel author,\" it shouted.  \"Yes, your current book is getting lots of great reviews and people are loving it.  But that's it, baby.  Nothing more to come.\"After a pretty discouraging two hours fighting my storyboard and this ruthless inner voice, I went back to bed.  Screaming under the covers does help, especially when someone who cares a lot about you is listening and can give good advice.Such as, \"What story are you really wanting to tell?  The one you have sketched out so far?\"No.  Not really.\"Then how do you rethink it?\"I talked it through.  I went through each character's main plot points, or story arc, and let the words out into the air.  As I spoke them, I could hear the strengths--there were some!--and the flaws.  \"What does she really want?\"  I answered that question.  \"What about this idea?\"  It was a good one.  Suddenly I had to run back downstairs and write it all down.The result wasn't a revamped storyboard--that will come later.  It was a character plot chart.  One for each of the three people I'm tracking.  As I wrote down their initial longing (that opens the story), their main challenges (that provide meat for the story), their crises (that peak toward the end), and the results, I saw the overlaps.  I realized I needed to do three separate storyboards, one for each of these characters.  Then weave them together.Whew.  Saved from my own self.  The critic stood back, nodded, said, \"Maybe you do have another book in you, after all.\"This Week's Exercise--for Novelists and Memoirists Make a plot chart for each of your main characters.  Keep their passageways separate until you get each uniquely on paper.  Then place them side by side and see where there's overlap.If you feel extremely brave after this, try storyboarding what you learn."},
{"title": "Ever Seen Your Name in Lights? I Just Did!", "date": "Friday, November 13, 2009", "text": "When I did my book signing last week at the Loft Literary Center in Minneapolis, a friend said, \"Check out the marquee.  Your name is in lights.\"  Luckily, someone had a camera.  My mother will never believe this otherwise.  It was a first, there for all the rush-hour traffic on Washington Avenue to see.  Book tours are strange experiences.  I've been very lucky on this one.  Minneapolis's book signing drew 90 people, and they listened to my 20 minute reading then asked such good questions about writing, I wanted to stay and talk with them all night.  I've been on book tour events where only a few people showed up, and I've spoken to other authors who've experienced the same thing.  So thank you, if you came to listen and support a fellow writer.  It's a solitary profession and we need all the support we can get."},
{"title": "Three Aspects that Make Writing Healing--And Create Good Books", "date": "Friday, November 6, 2009", "text": "This past weekend I taught my trio of one-day workshops at the Loft Literary Center in Minneapolis.  One of them, the most difficult to teach and the most rewarding for me, is called \"Writing through Healing, Healing through Writing.\"Twenty-eight writers of all skill levels, genres, and ages gathered in one of the Loft's beautiful classrooms for a day.  We explored what made our writing go deep enough to be healing--for us as well as for a reader.I've taught the class for about ten years, using ever-growing research about the healing effects of certain types of writing.  James Pennebaker, from the U of Texas, Austin, launched my interest in this topic.  He clued me into the amazing medical documentation on creative writing's benefit in reducing physical illness and emotional stress.One of my favorite books on this subject is Louise De Salvo's Writing as a Way of Healing.  De Salvo talks about Pennebaker's research and how important it is that writers use all three of the elements that make writing actually heal.  I've journaled for years and was very interested in hearing that venting into my journal, for instance, doesn't have healing effects on me.  It's good for processing, not healing.To heal us and touch the reader, writing must have:1. specific details (senses-rich images, rather than concepts)2. how the writer or narrator felt about the event when it happened3.  how the writer or narrator feels about the event nowDe Salvo cites the research of Pennebaker and others, noting that it is the combination of these three elements that makes writing a healing process.  Not one alone, not even two.In my workshop this weekend, writers asked themselves which of these three aspects they  naturally favored.  A person who writes about thoughts and feelings will use doorways #2 or #3 to enter her story--reflective, conceptual writing.  The third aspect, specific image-rich detail, is the missing element.  When it's added to the piece of writing, the magic happens.  The writing becomes healing.  Same with a writer who lists events and specific details with no trouble.  But the missing element is the feeling, the \"what does this mean to me?\" analysis of the experience.  Some writers believe that the events should speak for themselves.  But there needs to be some reflective writing to make it mean something to both writer and reader. Why don't writers naturally incorporate all three aspects, giving themselves a healing boost from their own art?Because it causes them to re-experience strong events, re-feel the strong feelings.I wrote many times about my experience with cancer.  I could reflect for pages on my feelings and thoughts about what happened.  But it wasn't until I began to add the specific details--describe the room and the chair where I had chemotherapy, tell about the movie I went to each week as a treat to keep myself from throwing up too much, talk on the page about what it looked like when I lost my eyebrows--did I begin to heal.This Week's Exercise List 10 turning points in your life, events or moments when you experienced a big change.  Pick one.  Set a kitchen timer for 20 minutes.  Write about it as it comes, then read it over.  Ask yourself which of these three doorways did you go through?  See if you can fill in the missing aspects.  Does it make the writing more healing for you?"},
{"title": "Beginning and Ending Chapters--Bookends You Can Work on First", "date": "Tuesday, November 3, 2009", "text": "My weekly book-writing classes at the Hudson Valley Writers' Center are wrapping up their six-week fall session this month.  We're reviewing what we've learned about first and last chapters.   In my teaching, I've learned these are essential signposts, bookends to keep a writer going forward with a book project.Many writers start with outlines. An outline seems the best way to manage a huge project like a book.  Outlines stall me.  I use an outline, like I use notes cards and a writing notebook, but outlines can't form the basic structure of my book.  It becomes too linear, too predictable.  If it doesn't surprise me, it won't surprise the reader.I use islands to start a book.  Kenneth Atchity (author of A Writer's Time) introduced me to the concept of \"islands,\" although Natalie Goldberg and others use them too.  Islands are nonsequential units of writing, dramatic moments in fiction or memoir, teaching moments in nonfiction.I begin my book in islands, not worrying how they're going to link up.  I just let myself write freely.Freedom's great.  But have you ever noticed what happens when there's too much freedom?  Islands become hard to organize.  The writer starts to lose perspective on her project. I use another tool, storyboarding, to help this.  But even more effective is the exercise of first and last chapters.Your First Chapter Must Have . . .In our summer session, my writing classes worked on their first chapters.  I asked them to consider these \"must haves\" in a first chapter:1.  Introduction of main players (narrator, others) via anecdote2.  Introduction of main dilemma or conflict (fiction and memoir) or main questions or need (nonfiction) that the book will answer3.  Placing the reader in a relevant container (physical and emotional and cultural setting) that will echo throughout the bookThe goal of the first chapter is just to create a tension cord, tight enough to pull the reader into the second, third, fourth chapters, and so on to the end.  You don't give everything away yet.  But you create a triggering event that triggers the reason for the rest of the book.  You create an engaging place and time for the story you're going to tell--even nonfiction books must do this via their opening anecdotes.We workshopped (shared with discussion) our chapter drafts and crafted them during the summer session.  I saw huge improvement in everyone's writing--it was as if the focus on a small part of the book, one essential chapter, helped the writers see strengths and weaknesses in their overall writing.By fall we were ready for the last chapter.  Even though nothing in the middle had been written yet.Your Last Chapter Must Have . . .Ending chapters are not where everything gets wrapped up neatly.  In fact, you must leave the reader with some hunger, some unresolved emotion, some longing to go back and read your book again.  That way they will think about the story for days, talk about it with their friends.  Lining up all the ducks is satisfying for you, boring for the reader.This isn't to say that you can leave large sections or questions unanswered.  If you're writing a mystery, you need to solve it.  But perhaps your memoir isn't going to reveal a happily-ever-after.  That's just fine.  Leave with a call to action or a relevance to the reader's life.  Make them think and feel a lot, and you have a good last chapter.What else makes a good last chapter?  Not introducing new dilemmas, or main conflicts.  It's too late.  The reader will go, \"Where'd that come from?\"  You can hint at one, if you're writing a sequel.  But main dilemma is rarely wrapped in the ending chapter.  More often you need to finish tying dilemma threads in the next-to-last (penultimate) chapter.What really needs attention in the last chapter are the main relationships.   How did the narrator change?  How did the method you're teaching shift your way of approaching life?  How did the character realize something?  Show us how the primary players changed, how something new was realized or achieved or lost.   Demonstrate a new state of being and you'll have the reader hooked, hungry, and happy.This Week's ExerciseSpend time with your first chapter, your last chapter, in whatever shape they might be.   Craft them if you haven't already--brainstorm possible beginnings, possible endings.  Then, using the notes above as a checklist, analyze the chapter drafts for what's missing and what's too much. Any time you spend on your bookend chapters will teach you a lot about your writing in general.And if  you live near the Twin Cities, consider joining me for a writing workshop on this subject.  It'll be on Thursday, November 5, 4-5:30 p.m. at the Loft Literary Center.  The workshop is called \"Container, Dilemma, and Players:  Three Essential Elements for Making Your Writing Come Alive,\" and we go into more depth and try writing exercises for these important chapter elements.Registration is limited.

{"title": "Pushing vs Resting--Why We Need Both Will and Vision to Complete a Book", "date": "Thursday, October 29, 2009", "text": "Today I am sitting still.  I'm visioning, listening, waiting.  It's the opposite pace of these last few months, when my novel Qualities of Light was released into the world.  When a book gets born, there's nonstop activity. Publicity, the book tour, interviews, good reviews if you're lucky.  I've been deep in all of this.  Today is different. Outside my window are sunlit fields and the fiercely gold last-ditch efforts of three fading maple trees. Inside, a vase of flowers is catching the light.  I haven't noticed this beauty lately, because of the pushing, the pace, the will needed to move my project out into the world.  Like birthing, it takes that push.  It's essential. Today I am resting from the pushing, to let bigger visions filter in and bring their welcome creativity and renewal.Balance of Visioning and WillVisioning and will balance each other in book writing like two ends of a seesaw.  If you don't have an initial vision for a book, you really don't create something that goes deep enough to touch readers, make them tell their friends and family and writing group about your writing, even change lives if you're lucky.  Visions change as the book evolves.  For Qualities of Light, I started with a vision of unexpected romance.  As it evolved, as more characters got developed, the vision changed into healing of a family.  Both stories made it into the final book.  I like to think the pauses, the visioning I did, helped them weave together into a whole.It's hard to book time for visioning.  The sequel to Qualities of Light is cooking.  It needs the visioning help to take it to the next step--I have a solid draft, some edited sections, but not a sense of the whole picture.  While I'm working on my publicity, I can't seem to slow down enough to vision.  I have to book a visioning day.Today, the end of October in peak leaf-changing New England, it feels like a cycle shifting, a perfect time to vision. New possibilities, the season changing.  Ideas are starting to come, faint pictures that will make a wholeness for this next book.  I am committed to taking notes today.I enjoy the golden trees, the flowers indoors.  The pushing mind empties, the attention is freed up.When You Know You Need Visioning TimeI usually don't accept the need for visioning time until I'm maxed.  Yesterday it hit me as a wave of sheer exhaustion:  I needed visioning time like oxygen.  I'm very happy about all that's happened but the pushing it's required has stressed me way beyond my comfort zone.  I'm grateful for the cheers and congratulations, but I'm an introvert (like many writers) and it wears me out after a while.  I'm really excited about my booksigning this weekend, November 1, in Washington Depot, Connecticut, and my booksigning Thursday, November 5, at the Loft in Minneapolis.  I'm really thrilled with the reviews coming out, the buzz happening.  Releasing a book is the realization of a dream:  wonderful, joyous, overwhelming.  But it needs the balance of visioning.  Otherwise we lose sight of why we're doing it.  Don't we.I was driving back from teaching a writing class when things reached critical mass.  The cell phone rang, I couldn't locate my headset in time, and for some reason this felt like the last straw.  I was on the very rainy Saw Mill Parkway, a twisty highway in western New York, and Chris Pureka was on the radio.  Her melancholy voice perfectly reflected the rainy fall day.  I felt myself let go inside.  Let the call go to voice mail.  Let myself just listen and drive, sink into the slow motion.    Then it happened.  I suddenly got a picture, a new idea, a wholeness.  As my pushing self let go of all the efforts, creative ideas came fast. Ideas to solve some dilemmas in my next novel, things I'd been struggling with.Planning for VisioningTake advantage of the change of seasons to set up a visioning time for your writing project this week.  Maybe you've noticed the difficulty in talking yourself into this need--and the effect of dried up writing that comes when you don't have an overview of your project?  And maybe you've noticed the serendipity that comes through, the originality, when you let yourself stop pushing and start visioning? This week's exercise: Take your solo self and your writing notebook someplace for an hour, an afternoon, a morning or a day. Let yourself look at changing leaves or mountains or the ocean.  Sketch, doodle, or write what comes.  Take notes.  Maybe you'll get the overview of vision, worth gold to the book writer.Also:  Write down what you'd really like from the project you're working on. What vision do you have for it?  Why are you doing it, really?"},
{"title": "Five Things You'd Never, Ever Do for Yourself", "date": "Monday, October 19, 2009", "text": "One of my favorite writing exercises is to list five things I'd never do, or I'd never make a character do, then write a scene imagining that very thing happening. It's an edgy exercise. But it always gets me out of a slump. This past week, I did something on my list--stand in front of about 70 people and read from my new novel. The novel is edgy, and I'm always aware that the subject matter might be seen as, to quote my wonderful mother, \"not my cup of tea.\" But it was what I felt compelled to write.  I'm proud I pushed past my fears, that I did something that scared me.  Because the results were so very worth it. The picture above was taken by photographer Bruce Fuller ( see his amazing work at http://www.brucefuller.com/).  If you look closely, you'll notice I'm not fainting or stumbling over my words, but really having a pretty good time. You'll see people listening and not walking out in boredom or disgust (a common fear of authors at readings).  It's a SRO crowd (the empty seat was even taken).   Most important to me, this photograph captures a moment where I was facing my fear and doing what was in my heart. This week's exercise is about pushing past your limits and fears.  Want to try it? This Week's ExerciseMake a list of five of the most frightening or impossible things you can think of doing to further your creativity, your book, your writing in general. Buy an expensive pen or laptop you want? Take a workshop you can't imagine being brave enough to try? Spend a weekend at a writing retreat to get peace at last?  You can also try this with your character, especially a stubborn character who refuses to evolve. What five things would this person never, ever do? Have them do one.  Warning label: Results of this exercise might feel astonishing, freeing, and joyous. The process might make you tremble before it helps you fly.  But look at me, in the photo. I'm actually having a blast. No problem that I couldn't sleep the night before, worrying about every little thing. It was worth it. And afterward, I slept like a baby. Very satisfied that I'd tried something that a few years ago I would never, ever do."},

Then I learned of some fascinating notes on the book at Derek Sivers's website.Sivers is no slouch when it comes to creativity--he knows whereof he speaks, having created the awesome www.cdbaby.com that helped so many independent musicians stay independent.One of Ignore Everybody's main points is that most creative people have two jobs. Ouch, my friends say. Can't I make a living at what I love?Well, yes, if you really really want to. That means (1) amazing luck, (2) incredible hard work, and (3) sometimes years of not earning enough to rent a teepee. I've watched so many writers quit their day jobs when The Book Idea comes along. I've watched them suffer with the pressure of trying to write to make that six figure advance, when they never wrote a word before. Better to take that pressure off your creativity, not flatiron your book into being. Books don't like that.You may not like this post this week. You may be a worthy dreamer who hates your cubicle life and wants to break out into the wealthy world of published authors. Most of us aren't. We're midlist, which means our books sell OK but not enough to pay all the bills. The most I ever earned from royalties in a year was about $30,000. I loved my book which earned that, but it was written without the pressure to earn big bucks.I was able to, because of my day job, stay creative. That's the point, isn't it? How to stay creative in a world that doesn't really like it.That's why MacLeod's book is so timely.This Week's Writing ExerciseThis week's exercise is pretty simple. Read the book review for Ignore Everybody on Derek Siver's site http://sivers.org/book/IgnoreEverybody then write your own list of what it takes for YOU to stay creative.Is it about ignoring everybody?Is it about paying attention to a few trusted people?Is it about a room of your own, a la Virginia Woolf, or a kitchen table a la J.K. Rowling, or a great Internet cafe that keeps you bubbling with stolen dialogue lines?Enjoy making your list. Let it simmer all week.In my novel, Qualities of Light, there's a triangle of love interests. Boy likes girl, girl kind of likes boy, girl falls in love with another girl. Not so unusual these days. To make matters even more tangled (a key element of novels), the love affair begins during a family tragedy, an accident that causes the girl's young brother to fall into a coma. The accident, of course, is caused by the girl. Or so she believes. And her belief causes the main dilemma of the story.Considering the questions exercise from last week, I was intrigued by this one, and it became the pivot for my book: Is love something you can expect, something you can delight in, when you are in deep trouble? When you have almost caused someone you love to die?My novel has several layers of these kinds of questions. I enjoyed not knowing the answers, exploring the topics.One topic that fascinates me is how gay or coming-out teenagers cope with their lives. So when a colleague pointed me toward an amazing article in last Sunday's New York Times magazine, I had to respond.I decided to write a letter to the editor. My experience sparked an idea for the writing exercise this week.Writing Your PassionThe article was called \"Coming Out in Middle School\" and author Benoit Denizet-Lewis interviewed some very interesting teens who did this and had various experiences. Molly, my heroine, struggles with the same issues real-life gay and straight teens face--acceptance and rejection, self-identity, the beauty of falling overwhelming in love at last. In writing the book, the struggles of my heroine and other kids like her became my passion. So I wanted to send a passionate response to this wonderful writer, Benoit Denizet-Lewis.Letters to the editor are a chance for low-risk passion statements. They may never get published, of course, but they're a chance for you, the book writer, to get your ideas, thoughts, and words to readers who might not otherwise touch them.My letter isn't a model of great Letters to the Editor, but here it is:Dear Editor,\"Coming Out in Middle School\" by Benoit Denizet-Lewis spoke eloquently of the challenges teens and pre-teens face when they discover they are gay. Finally our society offers support for GLBTQ youth, the necessary emotional shelter they need as they come to terms with who they are. I especially enjoyed reading the discussion of how old youth are when this awareness happens--much younger now, and thankfully much more supported.However, the author did not cover a huge and essential aspect of teens coming out: What happens when a teen finds out they are gay because of a sudden love interest? I explore this topic in my new young-adult novel, Qualities of Light (October 2009, Spinsters Ink). Perhaps the teen has always dated boys and suddenly falls in love with a girl. What happens when the teen's friends, who are heterosexual, make fun of the new pairing? Is it safe to tell parents, who may not support the sudden change?Unlike Denizet-Lewis's subjects, these teens may not know how to make the transition. When researching for my novel, I found few books treated this subject, few served as literary mentors for teens falling in love with their best friends, as my heroine Molly does. A vastly different experience than the gradual coming out of the profiled teens in Denizet-Lewis's excellent article.It's timely that this article comes out at such a ground-breaking moment in our history, when states are legalizing gay marriage and accepting that love is love. What we need is more literary models for teens who experience the sudden awakening of the heart and wonder how to reorient their lives to its truth.Sincerely,Mary Carroll MooreStand Up in Print--A Way to Practice Your Book-Writing PassionDo you feel it's important to stand up for something in print, be heard--before your book sees its readers? Find an article to praise and comment on. Editors of publications like both. They work hard to find good material and they love it when readers notice that.Scan your local newspaper or a monthly magazine this week and find something that connects with your book topic. Craft a response. Mention your book (in progress, if that's true). Send it off. See what happens.PS Most Letters to the Editor can be sent by email nowadays. Just follow the guidelines--they usually need your name, address, and phone, although the last two items are usually not printed."},
{"title": "The Power of Unanswered Questions", "date": "Tuesday, September 29, 2009", "text": "As someone who loves it when the ducks are lined up, I used to hate unanswered questions. Problems I couldn't solve, dilemmas unresolved, drove me nuts. I worked hard at applying solutions to every problem.I felt great when the issue got fixed. I tallied up answers like gold.Then I began writing books. Books are large, unweildy events, worse than organizing a family wedding. Hard to predict what will happen. Hard to plan entirely. Full of unresolved problems and big questions that may not get solved until the final draft. My first books were nightmares, partly because of my need to solve every problem right away. Luckily, back in the olden days when I began publishing, I worked with patient editors who taught me the power of the unanswered question.This may not be your issue--at all! But if it is, read on.Love the Questions ThemselvesRainier Maria Rilke, the German writer responsible for the beautiful volume Letters To A Young Poet, said, \"Have patience with everything that remains unresolved in your heart. Try to love the questions themselves, like locked rooms and like books written in a foreign language. Do not now look for the answers. They cannot now be given to you because you could not live them.\"Rilke's point was that hanging around with questions leads to the best answers. You need time to live your way to the answers.  There's real gold in the questions themselves because they open up the creative self.I've often asked my book-writing classes to begin a list of questions about their books-in-progress. Add to the list, one question daily, and let yourself muse and wonder about what the answer could possibly be. Once I became patient enough to try this myself, I saw great improvement in my writing. It was as if a creative faucet got turned on.I wasn't just working my problems to find solutions; I was creating something new. My random, creative, wondering and wandering writer inside was excited.Does Unanswered Equal More Creative?Why are unanswered questions so helpful for book writers? Why do we need NOT to know everything before we begin our writing process?Theme, subtext, and inner story all emerge from the random, creative side, not the linear left brain of the writer. You can't get good theme by going after it directly. It bubbles up. It surprises you. A writing mentor once told me: \"If it doesn't surprise you, it won't surprise the reader.\" You'll have a too-predictable plan, leading to an unoriginal and uninspired book.  This week, make a list of unanswered questions. Things that are worrying you about your outline or theory, plot or characters, theme or beginning or ending. Let the list simmer. Let the questions become part of your breathing and living each day. When you get the bubbling up of a possible creative idea that addresses your question, listen and take notes. Your muse is talking.PS This exercise isn't just limited to writing. I've used it to create answers to tangles with family and friends, health issues, everything under the sun. It's fun, creative, and it works."},
{"title": "So Your Book Is Finally Written and Published--How Do You Launch It?", "date": "Sunday, September 20, 2009", "text": "If you're in the very lucky position to have (1) finished writing your book, and (2) sold your manuscript to a publisher, you'll soon be facing an exciting question: How do I want to launch my book? You're about to be on stage--and that's a good thing. Long ago, publishers did this work and writers stayed behind the scenes, but readers of this blog who are savvy to the changes in the book publishing industry know that publishers no longer launch a book for you, unless you're a proven best-seller. You do your own singing. Often there's very little publicity budget once your book is published, and most publishers depend on writers to do the legwork, find the reviewers, and set up their own book events to help readers find out about their books. You can't be shy now--you have to believe in your book enough to design, dream, and deliver a successful launch.I can hear those trigger fingers moving, but before you click away from this post (\"I am nowhere near launching anything!\"), read a bit further. Even beginning book writers might have fun with this week's exercise. It's a way to design your book launch but also work with a tried-and-true universal principle of thinking from the end. In other words, what you put your focus on, manifests. Put your focus on publication, and it might work. This week's exercise is in two parts, and we begin with famous cartoonist Scott Adams.Scott Adams Did ItDilbert's creator, Scott Adams, was said to have penned a positive statement about his cartooning career each day. He wrote it fifteen times. The theory is that his focus was shifted, over time, to the potential instead of the fears. I don't know what he wrote, but it was something like, \"I will be a famous cartoonist.\" And so he was. I love this exercise. I use every time I am wanting to manifest something really good--like an excellent book launch--and remind myself of the potential rather than the fears in this crazy life of writing books. The exercise works best if you keep the statement beneficial to more people than yourself (another universal principle).Some examples of this exercise from my writing students: \"I'm delighted with my published book.\" \"My published book is everything I've dreamed it could be.\" \"Readers are loving my book and it's changing lives for the better.\" \"My book is practically writing itself--and I am thrilled at how it's coming together.\" \"My writing feeds my soul.\" As I prepare for three book events for my new novel, Qualities of Light (see below for dates--please join me!), my positive statement is: \"My book events are easy, delightful, and full of joy, and people are so inspired by my novel.\" It focuses me on the highest dream. Try it yourself, at whatever stage in book writing you are right now. Make sure to write the statement fifteen times--because something shifts around the tenth or eleventh time you pen that statement. It starts to click in the change of attitude.Part 2 of the ExerciseOnce you've set the tone of your book launch, it's time to get specific. Ask yourself:1. What venue would I enjoy most (a bookstore, a writing school, a gathering in a community center or art gallery)? No limits nowadays. Just be sure you can accomodate the crowds you hope for, there's plenty of parking, and the venue is open to the public.2. What format would make my book shine? At a minimum, authors will often read an exciting excerpt (about 10 minutes max), answer questions from the audience, and sign books at a table. But you can also conduct a free workshop on your book's topic, talk about how you wrote it, offer a panel discussion of contributors, etc. Think about your best result (see part 1 of exercise) and what would bring it. 3. What publicity do I want to do ahead of time? Are you up for radio/TV/print interviews? Posters and postcards? Email to friends and family? Publicists say that people need to hear about something six times before they are hooked enough to buy or show up, so spread the word in more than one way.Using the inspiration from your positive statement, written fifteen times, brainstorm on the specifics. Spend 10-20 minutes on this part of the exercise. Benefit: You focus on the potential, not the fears.Please join me for the book launch of Qualities of Light, my first novel,if you're near any of these locations:Tuesday, October 13, 7:00 p.m.: Hudson Valley Writers' Center, Sleepy Hollow, NY (Westchester County, on train line from NYC), http://www.writerscenter.org/ for directions.Sunday, November 1, 2:00 p.m.: The Hickory Stick Bookshop, Washington Depot, CT, http://www.hickorystickbookshop.com/ for directions.Thursday, November 5, 7:00 p.m: The Loft Literary Center, Minneapolis, MN, http://www.loft.org/ for directions."},
{"title": "Reading My Own Novel--A Lesson in What Happens When You're Not Looking", "date": "Saturday, September 12, 2009", "text": "The week I got my first copy of my new novel, Qualities of Light, I was like a raft floating in serene blue water. It had happened at last. Holding it in my hands was a thrill. I didn't even open it for a few minutes. Then I gave myself two days and read it cover to cover.A wonderful editor accepted the book and a wonderful press has published it, but I spent a year trying to sell it before that happened. I'd kept notes from agents and editors who'd seen the manuscript that difficult year. These agents and editors sent me brief or beautiful rejection letters--and I kept many of them. The helpful ones encouraged me. The agents and editors who were kind enough to take time from their busy workdays to tell me why they rejected my manuscript, what they'd recommend changing. This kind of information is gold to the writer struggling to publish.The most constant comment: \"Begin the story in chapter 5.\" Chapter 5 is where the main character begins to fall in love. I couldn't figure out why everyone thought this was the main story of the novel. To me, the main story is the complex relationship Molly has with her artist father. But everyone else disagreed. Eventually, I heeded the advice. The last helpful editor sent me detailed suggestions, including the now-familiar \"Begin with chapter 5.\" So I jettisoned the first four chapters. I put them into my \"extras\" file on my computer and wove the best bits into other chapters. Now the book starts right in with the love tangle instead of the family tangle. Rereading it this week, I saw why it works. As deeply as I was interested in the family tangle, most readers love a love story. That's what they wanted.Why We Writers Need Readers These agents and editors--and my writing partner and writing groups--did me a great service. Their comments forced me to go back to what I was originally excited about in this novel when I began writing it nine years ago. It was the unlikely romance. The family tangle came later, when I was searching for a subplot to give tension to the story. Once I rediscovered, via helpful advice, the real center of my story and rearranged it accordingly, I sold it within a month. We writers want to keep our ideas \"pure\" and untouched by others' opinions. This is downright snobby, a typical ego-driven artist viewpoint. I'm there often, and it never serves me. Most readers, if they're intelligent and kind, will point the writer back to her original focus. They will help the writer weed out the sidetracks that don't serve the story. This Week's Writing ExerciseMake a list of feedback you've gotten so far about your book. What's the most consistent comment? Is it, like with my novel, to begin somewhere else, with another focus? Why have you listened or not listened to this feedback? What has changed in your writing because of it? Then make a list of the readers in your life--people who have read your work and given you feedback. Send the most important one a thank-you note. Tell her or him why you appreciate the feedback, what it's taught you."},
{"title": "How to Use Your Writing Notebooks to Feed Your Book", "date": "Monday, August 31, 2009", "text": "Sarah Tieck, a fellow instructor at the Loft Literary Center, emailed me with a great question about writing notebooks. I've heard the same question from other writers.\"I was remembering a recent blog entry where you talked about how you work with your exercises in your notebook on a weekly basis,\" Sarah said.  \"I'm wondering what you do with older writer's notebooks. . . I've got dozens and their current format isn't useful. I almost never return to them because the information is not organized or easily retrievable. How do you handle your archives? Any tips or thoughts would be appreciated!\"Writers produce writing. And if you're a writing geek like me, you love to write longhand in notebooks, not just on the super-fast computer. Notebooks let the right brain ramble slowly, and the writing I do longhand is often pensive, full of imagery.  I notice things I'd breeze over. My just-released novel, Qualities of Light, started from a notebook full of tiny scenes scribbled while vacationing at a lake cabin in the Adirondacks. It was too hot to think, so I filled one notebook with random images: weedy lake smells, sounds of loons yodeling, fast-moving clouds, a girl in a bright-red tank suit racing across the lake on water-skis. This slow cooking got me started.  I moved to scenes where the girl falls in love, her six-year-old brother almost drowns, her artist father betrays her, her entire family tries to orient itself after the near-tragedy.  Each tiny snippet became a chapter. And now it's all become a published book--thanks to my notebooks that summer. So I believe in these notebooks. Big time. The question is: How can you make the best use of yours?How to Use Your NotebooksClaire-Fontaine notebooks are my favorite. I fill them up pretty fast--every two months if I'm cooking on a new book. New books require lots of freewrites, bad writing, shitty first drafts as Anne Lamott calls them. Notebooks are private, so they are perfect for these SFDs.But notebooks become unusable if you let them languish on a shelf. Right?So I set up a system. On a writing day soon after I complete a notebook, I set aside two hours for reading and marking. I try to take myself out to lunch or dinner or to a museum or public garden, make this a little artist's date, a la Julia Cameron, have some fun. I bring along a yellow highlighting pen and a stack of Post-Its in different colors, snacks and tea, my iPod with no-lyrics music, and headphones. I plug into my wordless music (lyrics are too distracting when I'm reading). I plug into my word-filled writing.Mark Anything You Can UseReading through the freewrites, ideas, notes to self, and character sketches, I first mark the ones that seem possible for my current book. These get a yellow highlighter stripe down the margin. Even if I don't know how I'll use the material, I mark it as possible. Post-Its are for ideas to follow up on. In my writing notebooks, I gather lists: books to read, topics to research, people to contact, websites to visit. The Post-Its become the logging system. Different colors for different tasks.The key here is to be as nonjudgmental as possible about your work and ideas. Treat anything as possible--and view your raw writing as if you've never seen it before. Like a reader would. Look for sparks that could possibly ignite something bigger. Back at the DeskWhen I get back to my writing desk, I begin the hard work: transferring the highlighted sections into a computer file called \"extras.\" This is tedious work (for me). But so necessary. Otherwise, I'll never, ever use the writing I've just delighted in. I also make a list on a legal pad of my to-do's. Sometimes, if I'm feeling particularly organized, I'll keep separate lists of tasks by type. This actually helps the tasks get done. And before I'm finished for the day, I select three tasks and put them into my calendar with dates to tackle them. Then What? What to Do with the Pile of Past NotebooksI never throw out my writing notebooks. Yes, this means dedicating an entire file drawer or shelf for them. But too many times I've been stuck for an idea and when I browse one of the old notebooks, I find it. Then there are the stacks of past notebooks that, once filled, haven't yet been opened. Milking them requires a steel will and a full day or more. When I was working on my last nonfiction book, How to Master Change in Your Life, I forced myself to go through old journals. Too many words to read carefully and still be home for dinner, so I just skimmed and place a Post-It on pages that seemed promising. I visited a photocopy store and Xeroxed the pages. Then put them into a folder. Planned an artist's date. Read through them and did the highlighting work. These became the backbone of my nonfiction book--believe it or not. All my best stories came from these notebooks. Even though they were old and reading through them was nothing short of embarrassing, I tried to keep that nonjudgmental attitude and be open to what might work. A lot did.Your Exercise This WeekGet one of your writing notebooks, even one you haven't finished, and try the highlighting and Post-It exercise above. Take an hour and transfer the most promising into your computer file. Name it \"extras\" and save it where you can find it again. Two more ideas:  See the new post below for a step you might want to take--using your notebooks to advantage by pairing them with a weekly class.

I've found you need three things:  persistence, support, and inspiration.  This blog was started to provide them all--the accountability that comes from regular writing, showing up at the page (whether in your notebook or on the computer) with practice; a forum for book writers to gather online; and inspiration via stories from those who've published.But sometimes you need another step, a real-time gathering of writers like yourself.My next round of weekly book-writing classes begins Monday, September 21, at the Hudson Valley Writers' Center near NYC.

{"title": "Keeping It Contained--Why Writing Short Can Help You Write Long", "date": "Monday, August 24, 2009", "text": "Sometimes we have to get small to get big, with our books. But it can also feel like a sidetrack away from the \"important\" writing. A writer from one of my book-writing weekend workshops wondered about this. She wasn't sure if the short stories she was suddenly drawn to were valuable detours or derailments.\"I'm working on Week 7 toward a January 1 rough draft date,\" she wrote, referring to a goal-setting plan each writer sets up for herself in my workshop. \"I have a nag buddy, which has been a great driver for me and for her. I'm doing well meeting my committment but I veered off into writing a short story, which will somehow end up as part of the book. I wonder if this has happened to you. Have you gone to something else just to keep writing? It irks me to have to ask this question, but I don't want to be diverting myself from the book writing, and I don't want to kid myself. On the other hand, all writing can go toward something, and I don't know where this book is going.\"Are you a memoirist who's working on essays as a relief from The Book? Even publishing a few in advance of finishing your longer work? A novelist noodling around with short stories? Believe me, this is normal--and a lifeline during the book-writing journey. I began my writing career as a newspaper columnist. Columnist write each week, on deadline, and their output is intense but brief. When I slid into fiction, I started with short stories. They were also intense but brief. Short pieces of writing taught me so much--about pacing, dialogue, the tension arc, the beginnings and endings.Lessons I learned for my novel Qualities of Light, which began as a series of short stories about the same group of characters. I was working from small to large, and an agent gave me timely feedback, pointing out the most compelling of the stories and saying the manuscript could become a novel centered around it. And so it did.In the long years of writing my novel, I needed breaks of brief intensity. I consciously diverted to short stories each summer. It was too much during the hot weather to think about 350 pages, so I thought about 20. Each summer I'd come back from my \"vacation\" into short form fiction refreshed and ready for the long haul. So short is good. It's not derailment, it's valid detour. Most writers need to write short in order to stay with the longer work. So I'll propose this writing exercise--which will seem to some like a total diversion. It's not. It's going to inform your book, I'm sure of it.Poem ExerciseCreate a haiku or short poem about your book, as it is now. Try to have the beginning, the ending, and the main conflict included in a few brief words. Then add a line about the main setting. And a line about the emotional container (see post below, two weeks ago).Like short stories, poems are great ways to refresh yourself, get new perspective, take a much-needed break for the creative brain. Thanks to writer Stuart Dybek for the idea. And to answer my student's question: Yes, by all means write short stories. Dive into them for a month or two, then bring what you learn back to your book."},
{"title": "Persistence--What You Learn When Your Book Is Finally Published", "date": "Sunday, August 16, 2009", "text": "This week my long-awaited (to me, at least) novel will be published. I began writing it nine years ago while vacationing at a lakeside cabin with friends. To acknowledge the hard work it took, today I listed my activities of persistence--what it took to finish it.1. I hired two coaches2. I went to five series of writing classes3. I enrolled in two years of an MFA program4. I joined three writers' groups5. I wrote every day for many months6. I found a great weekly writing partnerAll this helped. But in the end, it got finished--and published--because of one small writing exercise, which I'll explain below.Belief and PersistenceI've worked with thousands of book writers. Many finish their books. Some don't. They are sometimes very talented writers with great stories to tell. Stopping mid-process puzzled me. But as I worked with more writers, I learned how persistence shapes creative work. How book writers need to keep going, even when the going is very tough. I learned to value persistence and a healthy belief in oneself and one's creative expression. Unless you love your writing, who will? This isn't to say you are ego-driven. You acknowledge what's not working as well as what is. But to constantly doubt, that's dangerous. That will lead to endless revising, endless questioning, and not holding your published book in your hands. This week's writing exercise is a list. It's a belief-boosting exercise that a fellow MFA student once gave me. We'd just left our morning workshopping session and I was beyond discouraged about my novel (the one that's being published this week).\"I'll never finish this,\" I said. I was quite certain. \"I'm not meant to. I don't have it in me.\"\"Nonsense,\" she said. (I love people who use this word.) \"You'll finish and you'll publish. It's a good story. It just needs your love.\"She told me to go back to my dorm room and start a list of anything I liked about the book so far. Keep the ongoing list in my writing notebook. Add to it, look at it as a reminder. Like a Valentine card to my emerging creative work, it would help me remember to love it. Here's what I wrote that day:Molly (the main character)Zoe (her best friend)when they first meet at the Boat House (the local dive)Chad's glassesthe still life paintinghow Molly felt driving the motorboat that morningthe lake at sunriseThis exercise reversed my discouragement. I went back to work. I regained my persistence and belief. Since that day, I added to my list as I learned more about my book and fell in love with it again. Start a list about your writing. What do you especially love about it, believe in? What gives you the persistence to keep going?If you'd like to join me in celebrating my novel, please consider visiting amazon.com today.

{"title": "Your Book's Container--And How to Write It", "date": "Sunday, August 9, 2009", "text": "A coaching client with a great story to tell is working on her memoir.  She asked a very good question about her book's container.  It sparked this week's writing exercise.I had asked her to incorporate more container in her chapter, by taking out the sections of thinking and feeling.  Whenever the author talked about her feelings and thoughts, the writing grew abstract and distant and the container was lost.  This confused her--as it does many writers.  \"It was my understanding,\" she told me, \"that 'container' is the place where everything happens.\"That's true.  I call it \"container\" because it's much more than just setting.  It's both inner and outer atmosphere, both physical and psychological/spiritual/emotional environment of your story.That's also where her confusion started.  \"Outwardly as setting and inwardly as emotional or cultural environment,\" she said. \"Therefore, it is two part. If I take out all feeling and thinking it would seem that one part would be missing.  I don't know what to put in its place.\"Such a good question--and a situation that stumps many writers, especially in memoir and fiction.  How do you create emotional container without telling us what emotions are being experienced?  How do you create a psychological container without telling us the thoughts of narrator or character?You show.  It's an old axiom in writing:  show, don't tell.  Showing reveals container as subtly as a butterfly landing on a late-summer dahlia--without any interpreting.  It just presents the situation and lets the readers perceive the effect.A pretty hard thing for us writers to do! But not impossible.  Here is how I suggest this talented writer go about refining her story's emotional and psychological container (feelings and thoughts).First, Do Your Outer ContainerThe first container you need to always address is the outer container.  This is what is traditionally called setting--and it's shown to readers via outwardly felt things.  Such as weather, time of day or night, where we are in a room or garden or other specific location, how the light falls on an object or a wall or someone's arm, what smells and sounds surround us.  Amazing how many writers omit these details, thinking they're boring or slow or unnecessary.  But they actually are the main transporters of emotion for a reader.  They set the stage.Imagine a play set on a blank stage--no backdrop, no furniture, no atmosphere.  OK, maybe nothing is an atmosphere, but only if the actors are very talented and can create something from that nothing.  It's much easier for the audience to perceive, say, an 1850s interior farmhouse if there are furnishings and a woodstove and windows with eyelet curtains. Same in your story.  Outer container is shown via your surroundings, what your narrator notices.  It's transmitted to a reader most easily via the five senses: smell, sound, taste, touch, sight. And it's best done without interpretation, no qualifiers, nobody telling us what the sights mean. In other words you may write, \"The dahlia was pink and gold and filled with summer light.\" You don't have to add \"It was beautiful.\" We already get that.Outer container is used by all kinds of book writers--even nonfiction writers who share ideas and techniques via personal stories need to make use of container to engage their reader in the setting. We engage most when we can \"be\" in the place you're describing.Then Do Your Inner ContainerWe also want to \"be\" in the emotional, cultural, and intellectual container of the situation, but we want to be shown (not told) this as well.  Readers are smarter than the writer thinks, most of the time.  They can perceive inner container via nuances of gesture, body sensations felt by the narrator or character, memories.  Say we're writing about a woman looking at a butterfly on a late-summer flower.  She's sad because her father just died.  The writer might choose to tell this sadness by having the woman think,  \"Looking at that perfect flower makes me so sad.\" Or, in third person, \"Joan felt sad suddenly, not knowing why.\" But these statements are abstract.  They tell, they don't show.  So the emotion of sadness is not conveyed.  The emotional container is a blank stage.To convey the emotional container, the writer needs to find a way to demonstrate Joan's sadness. Not speak it or tell it, but show it.  Maybe the woman picks the flower and shreds it in her fingers.  Maybe she creates a trail of flower pieces along a sidewalk or windowsill.  Maybe she goes outside at the same time each morning to watch the flower as it fades and dies.   Much harder work to notice these actions and write them, than to just say \"Joan was sad.\"  But that's how good books are made.  By hard work, by good noticing, by careful writing.When I'm stumped on how to write emotional container, I go back to Pulitzer-Prize winner Robert Olen Butler's wonderful book on writing, From Where You Dream. I use two of his suggestions for enhancing emotion in story.  This works in every genre, although Butler's book is geared to fiction writers.  Here's a recap of his two suggestions, in my own words:1. Have the narrator feel something in their body. This is a physical sensation that's not interpreted. It has to be felt by the body, not thought or observed by the mind, to convey emotion to readers. \"Joan's throat tightened and her eyes stung.\" \"Flashes of heat traveled across my skin.\" \"My stomach was suddenly hollow.\"Specific and felt sensations, these happen in the body and are not interpreted.   Let the reader perceive what this means.  Most of us would understand what emotion is experienced by tight throat and stinging eyes (sadness) or flashes of heat on skin (fear, excitement).  We'll read on to find out if we're right!2. Have the narrator access a brief memory of a similar time that contrasts or connects in some way with the emotional container now. \"Joan remembered her father's hands picking dahlias from the garden, arranging them in a cobalt vase, bringing them to her room.  Only three dahlias, but always perfect.\"  We don't need to add \"He loved her very much.\"  We read on to find out if he did--because the emotional container hints at it--or if he was obsessed with her or what.  No interpretation needed.This Week's ExerciseTake a thought or feeling--any sentence in your work where you've written the \"told\" feeling or thought, such as \"Joan was sad.\" For 10 minutes, brainstorm all the ways the surroundings could reveal this sadness.  How can you transmit sadness without using the word sad?  Then replace the telling with showing.  See if the emotion is heightened."},
{"title": "Writing past the Summertime Blahs", "date": "Monday, August 3, 2009", "text": "When I first came across Julia Cameron's The Artist's Way, I loved her morning pages but was stymied by Artist Dates. Cameron recommends we stuck creative artists spend an hour a week out and alone somewhere new, exploring a museum or craft store, walking in a park or by a river, just to fill the creative well.Sometimes writers face a flatness in summer, when it's hot and the writing is not. I've found NOT writing a great way to get started again--but the NOT writing has to contain something to fill the well, a la Julia Cameron's Artist Dates.This week's exercise encourages you to go on an hour's vacation from your normal life--work, family, home, endless to-do lists--and visit a creatively inspiring place. Let your racing mind slow down. Stare at museum exhibits or paintings. Watch the breeze in the trees. But don't write. Not a word. Force yourself to stop your output and just input for a while. Instead of all the endless exhaling of energy, fill yourself with new breath.Sounds silly, simple, stupid? Not at all. Your right brain will start engaging, seeing and hearing and smelling things your busy left brain has forgotten to notice. These small details are what fills the creative well.Part two of the exercise: After you come back from your Artist Date, sit for ten minutes and record impressions. Nothing big, just little ideas, sensations, thoughts, memories that come now that you're refreshed. Scribbling is good. Drawing is even better. Let the images flow onto the paper. Make it fun, easy. No pressure here.I've come to my best writing ideas by doing this deliberate break. It takes me off the production wheel and really fills the well.See if it works for you! It might help you write past the summertime blahs."},
{"title": "Linkage--A Great Technique to Beat the (Writer's) Block", "date": "Monday, July 27, 2009", "text": "Like boards on a fence, sentences tie together thoughts. But too tied up, they lead to blocked creativity. Enter linkage, a technique that beats the block and keeps the gate open.  I learned about linkage years ago. Maybe in a writing class, maybe from a colleague. Since I heard this simple technique, I've read that it's used by many professional authors. Try it this week--it'll help you keep momentum between writing sessions. Here's how it works: Simply leave your last sentence of the day unfinished.For example, instead of ending a writing session with a complete sentence, which leaves no \"linkage\" to the next day's work, I leave the sentence hanging.Not \"Molly looked out the window and saw the blue Ford Escort.\" But \"Molly looked out the window and saw...\"Why does linkage work so well? Because the mind hates a vacuum. Overnight (or over several days, if you write less often) your creative mind will explore options for ending this sentence. It will drive you a little crazy--a good thing! You will itch to get back to the page to finish the thought. Simple, huh? Harder than it looks. You'll want to finish the thought and wrap it up. Clean as you go. But repress the urge and leave it hanging. Along with a little crazy, linkage will drive you back to your writing faster than anything I know."},

I found a large jar of buttons collected from friends who love to sew.So when a writing colleague passed along this great exercise, I had to try it. It's by writer Roz Goddard, and it uses the tiniest of ojects--a button--to get deeper into a story. I tried it in my classes and many of the writers found it helpful for uncovering aspects of character that had eluded them.Click here to try it out.Imagine using it for one of your main players in your book. Let your limitations go, and see what comes. For memoir or nonfiction writers, use your imagination while trying the exercise, then ask: How is this person I've just written about similar or different to someone in my book? (This brings your freewrite back to factual truth, which is essential for these genres. But the imaginative qualities of fiction-writing will open doors you won't believe!)"},
{"title": "Dilemma, Players, Container--Three Essentials for Chapter One", "date": "Monday, July 13, 2009", "text": "My summer session writing class is climbing mountains! They're working on chapter one of their books--perhaps the hardest chapter to write. It has to establish three essential elements that pull the reader into your story. These elements are key to successfully placing your manuscript with an agent. If you don't have them securely in place, you won't get a contract. They exist in any genre of book, if you know how to find them. Three Steps to an Eye-Catching Chapter OneChapter one is often the chapter agents request, if you're lucky enough to write an eye-catching query letter. So this initial chapter is a make-or-break experience. If an agent loves it, they'll ask for more. If not, \"Sorry, it's not for us.\"I've found most great books--in any genre--hint at these three elements in chapter one. Dilemma (the conflict, the question). Players (who's on stage, who should we care about). Container (the place everything happens, both outwardly as setting and inwardly as emotional or cultural environment). These elements create a kind of tension cord. It pulls the reader through your book to the last page. If they are not all in place, the cord is slack.Entering Your Book via Your Natural StrengthEvery writer has one of these as a natural, almost unconscious, strength. A mystery writer might think up plots--dilemma. She would enter her story from the question What happens? But she might overlook the place it happens, and the characters who are complicating things and getting deeper into trouble. So her story is interesting but the agent or editor might say, \"Your prose needs tightening.\" Read: \"Two elements are missing here; plug them in.\" Or, most important: \"Make us care!\"A medical memoirist might also think of dilemma first--the accident that left him in a wheelchair, for instance. Event is what matters most to him, but the reader engages through first caring about his dilemma--or character. So the memoirist must begin to reveal himself on the page, more and more. Not always comfortable, but essential. A psychologist writing a book on mental illness might think first of players--the people she counsels at the clinic or hospital, their personalities. She presents their background, their case histories (disguised or with permission), but she can't figure out how to place them in a setting that's believable. She begins to write the setting--a hospital--and suddenly we see the frailty of these people because we smell the antiseptic or hear the intercom paging doctors. Your job is to think of all three, no matter which strength you build from. And they all must appear in chapter one.How Does Chapter One Reveal Dilemma, Players, and Container?I just read the opening chapter--only three pages long--of Judy Blundell's What I Saw and How I Lied. Blundell won the National Book Award for this novel. Her first chapter made me want to buy the book. Because it covers all three elements.We learn of the main players first--a mother who smells of cigarette smoke and My Sin perfume, the young daughter who pretends to be sleeping beside her, the brother who may have died tragically, the father who left, the mysterious friend. We learn of the dilemma--a small reference to the beach town and how everyone knows the family's faces because they've been in the news recently. Blundell also creates an amazingly engaging container, both physically and emotionally, with lines like \"The match snapped, then sizzled, and I woke up fast\" or \"I heard the seagulls crying, sadder than a funeral, and I knew it was almost morning.\" This Week's Writing ExerciseWant to join my writing class--at least virtually--this week? Try focusing on chapter one. Can you draft it--or look it over if it's already written--and check it for these three elements. What's missing? What's already present?Then find a favorite published book in your genre. Read it to learn how the writer presents dilemma, players, container in the first chapter. How were you hooked into reading on?How can you change your chapter one to be as successful?"},
{"title": "Keeping Your Book Project Alive--While Living a Normal Life", "date": "Tuesday, July 7, 2009", "text": "Michelle Goodman is the author of two really good books, helpful to writers and anyone seeking a creative life. First, she quit the 9 to 5 and wrote a guide on how to do it--The Anti 9-to-5 Guide. Then she wrote another book on how to be a successful freelancer--My So-Called Freelance Life--that gives practical advice to anyone trying to earn their living by doing what they love.I interviewed Michelle about her book-writing journey. Hopefully some of her ideas will be useful to you too--as they provide the idea for this week's writing exercise.MCM: What do you do to keep your faith in your book projects during the tough times that hit every author?Michelle Goodman: Enlist a couple of close writing friends to read my pages for major gaffes or holes and to talk me off of the ledge as necessary. Tape reminders of what I want to accomplish with the book to the wall behind my computer, along with any pep talks and publishing-related jokes friends have sent me along the way.Get out of the house for some blood-pumping exercise to clear the creative mental cobwebs that seem to appear at least once a week.Make sure the house is stocked with really tasty health food that requires little preparation, as well as several pounds of chocolate. When too spent to complete another sentence, hit the hay, even if just for an hour.MCM: What's the funniest learning experience you've had while working on a book?Michelle Goodman: I'm not sure how funny this will be to anyone other than me, but YouTube really saved me while writing the last book. I'd watch my favorite Buffalo Springfield, Woodstock-era CSNY, and early 70s Genesis videos as a reward after finishing each section of a chapter. Who knew Steven Stills and Peter Gabriel would play such an important role in the book-writing process?MCM: When you are working on writing a book, how do you juggle your bread-and-butter work (regular job) around creative time?Michelle Goodman: My regular job is being a full-time freelance writer (articles, columns, blogs, and sometimes, corporate copy). When I was working on my two books, I had to clear the decks of all other projects. It's too difficult for me--and most people--to write/edit a book 6-8 hours a day and think that I'm also going to have the time, energy, or brain juice to write something else that day.For my first book (The Anti 9-to-5 Guide), the advance was so small that I just lived off savings during the six months or so I spent writing it. Fortunately, the advance for my second book (My So-Called Freelance Life) was a bit more substantial. Of course, things never go quite the way you plan: I landed both a regional and a national column while writing My So-Called Freelance Life and had to work on meeting weekly deadlines for both during the last couple months of writing the book.I was working all the time, sometimes not even sleeping more than four hours a night. It was hell, but I'm glad I did it. Those columns now help sell both my books.MCM: Thanks, Michelle, for this real-world advice. To learn more about Michelle's books click here (My So-Called Freelance Life) and here (The Anti 9-to-5 Guide). You can also read her great ideas on using a blog to boost a book proposal by clicking here.This Week's Writing ExerciseMaking your writing dream happen--what does it take? Magic, hard work, belief, all of these? From Michelle's comments, you saw how much a professional writer supports her dream--with music, chocolate, reminder notes that boost the spirit, good writing friends.It takes a willingness to put into place this kind of good support. But it also takes a willingness to let go of something that might be blocking you, taking up too much time, or wearing down your energy.This week, look at your life. Either chart one day, as one of my coaching clients does, to see where support is and where time is disappearing into stuff you really don't get much out of (her support list included a weekly writing group; her energy drainers were nightly evening news, long phone calls with her sister, and too many potato chips).What are you willing to put into place for support?What are you willing to let go of?Stop the magical thinking about your creative dream with this book. You can do it. Just make room for it in your life.What do you think of this?  Do you agree with Michelle's suggestions--or have ideas to share with other readers about your own experiences with juggling your writing and your life?"},
{"title": "Emotional Punch in Your Writing--Why Setting and Show-Don't-Tell Deliver Emotion", "date": "Monday, June 29, 2009", "text": "A memoirist in my writing workshop was refining a passage in her story about the effect of her father's early death on the family. She wanted this passage to be especially impactful for the reader--convey the emotion of this difficult day.  After her father dies, she is in the kitchen with her aunt, watching breakfast cleanup and trying to absorb the grief that's descended on everything. \"It's a really important moment in my story,\" the writer pointed out to us, \"so why do I feel like I'm writing it from another room?\"Since the passage wasn't delivering the emotional punch she wanted, we started analyzing her description of her aunt that morning. \"Well, her hair was messy, her clothes didn't match, and she picked at her fingernails while we ate breakfast,\" the writer said.Our class agreed these were good details to describe the upsetting moment, and they were specific. But we were still not getting the impact of grief. It wasn't a \"felt\" emotion, only a thought. The writer wasn't yet putting us in the container of the story.\"Is it because you're telling us about her,\" one student asked, \"and you need to show us?\"For a Reader, Emotion Comes from Demonstration, Not DescriptionShowing and telling are familiar terms to many writers. But what do they exactly mean? The writer in my class selected a key emotional moment to demonstrate the family falling apart. She felt the bewildered grief because she had been there, watching. But we didn't, as readers. That meant that she hadn't yet succeeded in demonstrating the emotion. She'd only described it.I asked this memoirist to close her eyes and put herself back into that scene, if she could. What did she notice, what small details came forward now? \"Watch your aunt move around the room,\" I suggested. \"Is she cleaning up from breakfast? What do you notice--smells? sounds? anything odd that stands out?\"Setting Details--Small but Essential Transmitters of EmotionThe writer jotted down four things:A rotten smell came from the garbage can.Her aunt's lilac sweater is buttoned funny, and she was usually the fashion example in the family.Her aunt's hands shook--they were so unsteady she dropped a glass in the sink.She didn't clean up the broken pieces.The writer looked up from her page. There were tears in her eyes from that final image of the broken pieces of glass in the sink.  I asked her why.  She said the glass pieces remained in the sink all morning--and sun from the window made them sparkle enough to catch the attention of anyone coming into the room. But nobody did anything. It was a touchstone for her from the emotion of the day, one she'd forgotten until now. It demonstrated the disorientation the family felt.Bingo. She got it. She rewrote the scene and it sang.  We all felt the emotion now. This bit of \"shown\" story--via a setting detail--transmitted (demonstrated) the emotion of grief and loss directly into the hearts and minds of her readers. She'd been unsuccessful with description, but demonstration succeeded. This Week's Writing ExerciseRead a passage of your writing where you want to convey emotion, where you want a punch. Now close your eyes and put yourself in the scene (if writing fiction, imagine your character in the scene). What setting details, tiny ones especially, do you notice? What smells or sounds? Make a list, as the writer above did. Add one to your passage. See if it helps! Let me know."},
{"title": "Necessary Boredom--Why Nonstop Rainy Days Actually Help Creativity", "date": "Tuesday, June 23, 2009", "text": "Dorothy Allison is the author of Bastard Out of Carolina and many other novels and short stories. Unusual in someone who has had a very dramatic and traumatic life, Allison spoke in an interview about \"necessary boredom.\" If it's present, she has enough intensity in her head for writing.As I thought about this, I realized the truth of it: when I have too much going on in my outer life, there's no internal space to dream. My writing process suffers.Writing process asks you to put aside the tendency toward drama in your outer life and put it into those pages. Writing is a priority in your life, you are committed to starting/finishing your book, and you are able to disengage from the outer drama enough to find the inner stillness to capture original ideas.Lately, I have had to work hard to find this inner stillness. In the past month I got married at my home with 70 guests present, my family began packing to move to another state, my teenager graduated and is preparing for a month-long cross-country trip, I squeezed in a visit to see my elderly mom, and I helped open a cabin belonging to my family. Exhausting just to write about! And that's not counting normal work--teaching writing classes and coaching writers each week. Where, I've wondered, is there time for necessary boredom?Schedules help. As much as they hamper the creative flow for me, they also create space for it. I sat with my family and went over schedules. We blocked in time for doing nothing. Sounds strange, backward, but it worked. Each family member got nothing time, alone in the house if possible, or alone at the fun places he or she likes best. We're all creative people. We all needed this necessary boredom.The rain helped too. New England has had rain 19 out of 21 days in June, and many are experiencing what the New York Times called \"rain rage\" but I took it as a sign from the Universe that necessary boredom was being fostered.Today's my morning. As soon as I post this blog, I'm taking myself into a spare bedroom with books and journals and ideas. I'm sitting and staring, getting bored with myself and my life. Out of it, I hope ideas will come. I'll be there to write them down.This week's exercise: get bored. Stop running the wheel for two seconds and do nothing. Schedule it if you have to, as I did. Let yourself slow, slow, slow down enough to where the original thoughts begin to surface. Where you let go of all those other people's voices and begin to hear your own."},
{"title": "Self-Assignments and the Writer's Notebook", "date": "Tuesday, June 16, 2009", "text": "Years ago, I read Writing Down the Bones by Natalie Goldberg and got the idea of self-assignments, based on writing prompts or seed ideas. These \"freewrites\" are simply set-aside moments when you write about something, anything, and stir up the creative juices. In book-writing, freewrites are where the \"inner story\" comes from--the theme, meaning, subtler levels, unconscious connections that delight both reader and writer as they emerge onto the page.My self-assigned daily freewrites came out a bit self-conscious when typed on the computer. When I read in another writing guide about having a writer's notebook to scribble notes and ideas, I decided to use it for my freewrites. I lived in France, so I became addicted to Claire-Fontaine's graph-paper-paged notebooks, spiral bound and thick, with bright colored covers. At Prisunic in Paris they cost less than $2.00. I would buy them by the dozen and load my suitcase on the way home to the U.S. Now they're available on Claire-Fontaine's website, although they cost more than $2.00 each. I'd date the beginning page, paste in photos or sketches, make lists of topic/island ideas for my book, craft the openings of short stories or essays. Each week I read over my notes and typed the most interesting ones into the computer. Begin a New Notebook for Each Book ProjectI began a new notebook whenever I started writing a new book. When the notebook was filled, I combed through its pages once more, then shelved it. Often, months or years later, I'd remember something neglected in its pages and I could retrieve a passage I liked for a story or chapter that needed a hole filled. My daily self-assignments came from the lists I kept going in the current notebook. When I finished the notebook, I photocopied the lists and pasted them into the new notebook. The lists became the front or end pages, easily located.Why Have a Writer's Notebook?The muse speaks at unexpected moments. How do you capture her ideas, which can disappear as fast as a dream on a busy morning? You take notes. I'd love to take a survey of published writers, since I know many have these writer's notebooks. One colleague said it was the main way she scribes her interior landscape. If the muse begins to funnel ideas and there's no place to get them written down, over time the ideas stop coming.I've learned that by making myself available to the muse, the inner vision, more ideas come. It's as if I'm forging an agreement. You give me the idea, I promise to pay attention.This week's assignment: Get yourself a writing notebook.  Claire-Fontaine or thrift store or local bookstore, small or large, spiral or perfect bound or loose-leaf pages, lined or plain. Enjoy the process of finding one. Write the date on the first page, then spend 10 minutes starting an \"idea\" list of topics you're interested in writing about someday. Create this list on the first or last page of your notebook. Practice this week carrying the notebook around and scribbling down ideas whenever they come."},
{"title": "How to Balance Structure and Exploration in Your Book Writing Process", "date": "Monday, June 8, 2009", "text": "I've just spent a few intense days reading the galleys for my upcoming novel, Qualities of Light, which will be published this summer.  My editor is wonderful, and I love how the book has come together.  I began it almost nine years ago with a short story about a complicated family of artists who live on a lake in the Adirondack mountains. Through many twists and turns, dozens of rewrites and moving over half the manuscript to be in another book, I finally got my story. Who was telling it, what it was really about. Now that it's going to be published, I'm working on its sequel. These characters won't leave me alone, and that's a good thing. But it's as if I've forgotten everything I learned on Qualities of Light. I'm once again agonizing over that balance beam a novelist--and any book writer--must walk between structure and exploration.When Exploration Starts a BookWhen you begin a new book, you enter via one of two doorways. If you start via exploration, it feels like an expansion inside. You're following a winding river, not sure where it's going to lead.   You get a direction, a glimmer of light, and you follow it. You may overhear a snippet of conversation and it intrigues you. Ideas float into your writer's vision. You're pulled into these ideas, and they take you somewhere.  One writer said, \"It leads to a moment.  I write to that moment.\" Writing a book from this doorway is expansive and playful. You may wonder, Am I really writing a book? (Or, Am I really a writer? Both worries surface for me, with each book I start from exploration.) But the gathering of images and words on paper is too much fun to stop. It brings you insights, it can change your life. You may also look as many book writers do--distracted. A conversation in your head is occupying most of your attention and nobody else can hear it.But there's a point when you start to lose your way. Writing expansively is fun, but it just creates more and more ideas. Eventually, you need to structure them. You need to get serious, as one of my teachers would say. Fish or cut bait. How do you do that? Coming from exploration, you use tools like outlines, storyboards, and character/plot lines--the structuring place where some writers begin.How Structure Begins a Book I began some books (the two novels mentioned above) from exploration. My nonfiction books were all begun from structure. I had an idea, yes, but I outlined or storyboarded it immediately. The structure formed the book-writing journey. Structures are reassuring to many writers. They create the outline and it's like a good map--or so they feel at the beginning. Structures can take you far. But most structures only represent part of a book: the plot, the action, the outer thread of the story. To get deep into character, emotional truth, insights that surprise both you and the reader, you have to go back to exploration.Moving from structure into exploration is a wild ride, especially for very linear thinkers. I recognize these writers (I are one!) when they come to my class, outline tightly in hand, and refuse to deviate from what they've already decided. No matter that their book hasn't sold, that agents or editors have told them \"it needs depth\" or \"it's a bit dry.\" Exploration would give them exactly that depth and juice, but it's too scary.I learned this when I fell into fiction. I learned how to explore. Because much of the good stuff came from places I'd never been as a writer.  The goal?  Balancing these two.  Exploration writers move to structure, to get their books grounded in form that a reader can follow.  Structure writers explore, to give their stories juice and energy.  It's a lovely dance.  If you're feeling stuck, it may be because you're not welcoming the other part of the process. Writing Exercise for This WeekThis week's exercise asks you to freewrite for 20 minutes about where you are with your book or your writing in general. What are you craving right now? Do you long for wild rides or more sense of direction? What's your next step--more exploration or more structure?"},
{"title": "Toggling between the Arts--Refresh Your Writer Mind", "date": "Monday, June 1, 2009", "text": "Do you pursue more than one art form? How does it help your writing? Are you toggling between the arts to good effect? Most days, I write. But when the writing dries up, when my chapters feel old and tired, I switch to painting. Susan Hodara from the New York Times interviewed me about my artistic multi-tasking--click on the link at top of right column above my photo to read it. I'm certainly not alone. Joni Mitchell was a painter first. Steven King plays in a band. There are hundreds of other examples out there--who can you name? Benefits of Artistic Multi-TaskingHaving another art form lets the writer mind play. Images, for me, lead to better writing. My painting feeds my books. A well-loved writing mentor told me she has dry spells that last for months. She's well published, prolific--from poems to novels to plays to even an opera. This used to worry her but no longer. She realizes a renewal time is necessary between efforts. Whenever she finishes a big writing project, publishes a book for instance, she lets her creative self lie fallow. Eventually, the ideas begin to bubble up. I often do this in summer, for one month. When summer comes to New England where I live, when my garden bursts with iris and peony, I become slightly disinterested in my book and my painter's eye wakes up. Another Way to Do Artist's Dates?Julia Cameron, author of The Artist's Way, calls this \"filling the well.\" Cameron recommends a weekly artist's date, solo, away from your work, to get renewed. I do it with my painting. Slop on some color, daydream over images for a while, and the writing ideas begin coming through again. This week, your writing exercise is to play with color. Get out some markers, crayons, oil pastels, watercolors, collage materials. Paint your story, your book idea, your frustration, your glee with your writing process. It only needs to take 10 minutes out of your busy schedule, and it'll pay you back many times over in renewal of creativity. See if toggling between the arts affects your writing the next time you face the page."},
{"title": "God--and Emotion in Your Writing--Is in the Details", "date": "Tuesday, May 26, 2009", "text": "Striving to get more voice, more emotion in your writing? One of my favorite nonfiction writers, Rick Bass, shares an important clue on how to do this. It goes back to the old saying, God is in the details.\"All of the smallest elements,\" Bass writes, \"the direction of a breeze one day, a single sentence that a friend might speak to you, a raven flying across the meadow and circling back again--lay claim to you, eventually, with a cumulative power.\"We're all after creating that kind of cumulative power in our writing. It's like the moment of seeing a completely developed perennial garden in full bloom--the sight of all those flowers, shapes, and scents in the summer light can take your breath. How do we get this in our writing--this synergy, this emotional effect? I think the clue is in the details, as Rick Bass suggests. How Much Detail Is Needed?In my writing classes, we labor over this: how to bring in the small details, not get bored with our own writing in the process, add just enough and not too much. Most writers add too little. I think it might be born from our sped-up lives. We move so fast, it's literally hard to stop and smell the roses. But we need to, in our writing, because the reader will want this emotional punch, this moment of truth, to come through. And if the writer doesn't experience it, the reader won't either.I'm not talking about painstaking details. One writer thought I meant this when I talked about putting in more details: \"I put my hand on the doorknob, turned it slowly, pulled the door toward me, stepped over the threshold.\" No, it's fine just to write, \"I walked into the room.\" But whenever you want emotional punch, effect, a moment of truth, you need to linger in detail.  Externally Felt Senses--Keys to Effective Detail in WritingMy tried-and-true way: adding senses. I can almost hear my writing classes groan. That again? Well, yes. It's vital. How many senses are used in the paragraph above, from Rick Bass? I count three. Touch (the breeze), sound (the friend's voice), and sight (the raven). It brings home the emotion, doesn't it? This week's exercise: Pick a random page of your writing-in-progress. Make sure it's random, not your best or worst page. Count the number of times you use the senses on that page. Where do you use them--when there's need for emotional impact? When you want a message to come across? Then brainstorm a list of sense details you could add to that page. I realize, for some of you, this will be boring, feel like too much detail. Usually if you have that reaction, you need more of it. It's been way too long since you slowed down enough to even notice the roses, much less smell them.Make sense? Agree or disagree? I'd love to hear your thoughts and your experiences if you try this exercise."},
{"title": "Building Just Enough Fire in Your Story to Attract a Reader", "date": "Monday, May 18, 2009", "text": "A writer in my Loft Literary Center book-writing class was working on her memoir. She asked a really good question during the weekend workshop. \"How do I keep enough personal fire or passion in my story, since it's about me? Yet not be too big a presence? If I'm there too much, interpreting and being the narrator too obviously, my reader can't connect with the story herself. It becomes a three-way conversation--not ideal.\"This writer is smart. She wants to understand a very basic book-writing challenge. How do we add just enough of our own passion to ignite the story for a reader--but not hang around warming our hands on the blaze?Have you ever read a story that had too much narrator presence? Beginning book writers often feel they must interpret for a reader--tell why something happened, give too much background, rather than let the story tell itself. It's indeed like buiding a good campfire. You get it going. It lights up the dark. The reader approaches, tentatively at first. If your fire is blazing and inviting, maybe they'll linger.Don't stand there talking the reader's head off, telling them about what wood you used and why it's so hard to build good campfires in this particular spot. Just let them enjoy the warmth. Let them inch closer. Otherwise, you're overwriting. Are You Overwriting?Your job, as the author, is to feed the fire, not worry it to ashes. You let a fire blaze on its own, after it has enough oxygen, kindling, dry wood. If you keep poking it every few seconds, the blaze will probably die out. Publishers, agents, editors--and readers!--look for stories that stand alone, fiery and bright, burning without any interpretation from the author. And it's not easy to keep a fire burning. Keep your passion for your story alive but take out your desire for interpretation. This is called \"overwriting,\" this is when you decide the dialogue isn't enough alone--you have to tell the meaning behind it. Some examples I've read of overwriting and author interpretation (beginning students' writing--used with permission):The trashcan smelled really bad, like a million rotted apples. Jason's hands shook and fear raced his throat. He felt scared.I longed to be outside, smell the trees and feel the spring air. Nature always gave me strength. I loved the great outdoors.Can you pick out the places where the author is standing too close to the fire, talking to the reader instead of just letting the reader enjoy the story that's being woven?Here are how these sentences could look, without the overwriting:The trashcan smelled like a million rotted apples. (We know rotted apples smell bad--why interpret?)Jason's hands shook and fear raced his throat. (These are already signs of being scared--why add it?)I longed to be outside, smell the trees and feel the spring air. (We'll read further to find out why--and the action itself will demonstrate that nature gives the narrator strength. The \"love of the great outdoors\" is implied--no need to restate.)This week, as an exercise to hone your fire-building skills, read two pages of your recent work. Look for any place where you restated the obvious, added more background or feeling or information just in case the reader didn't get it. Strike through those sentences and read the paragraphs without. See if you don't feel a stronger blaze."},
{"title": "Marrying Two Things That Don't Go Together--A Book-Writing Exercise", "date": "Monday, May 11, 2009", "text": "When I was in the deepest struggle with my novel, Qualities of Light, I took a one-day workshop from author Alison McGhee. Alison has won awards for her fiction and my favorite of her novels is called Shadow Baby. I was truly stuck in the shadows of my story, not knowing where to go next. I thought she could help.Alison gave us a writing exercise that changed the way I look at story-making. She wrote two lists on the blackboard. One list had five people--a six-year old boy, a seventy-five-year old woman, a teenager, etc. The other list had objects--a birdcage, a water glass, a jackknife. We were to pick one item from each list and write a scene using them both. I picked the six-year-old boy, since one of my main characters fit that age, and the jackknife. I stared at my writing notebook, hoping for magic.I don't know much about jackknives. I know they are precious to boys, especially if they belong to someone revered. I decided I would have my character steal the jackknife that belonged to his father, a war-era relic very precious to the older man, and the jackknife would be subsequently lost. When I began writing I didn't know all this, but I trust freewriting, automatic writing, stream of consciousness, for developing scenes. The writing time was much too short. I was literally silenced by the scene that emerged. Sammy, the six-year-old, steals the jackknife on the morning of his birthday. Molly, his older sister, is badgered into taking Sam for a dawn boat ride, even though her father has forbidden use of the ancient motorboat. Sam, leaning over the side to watch ducks, drops the knife in the lake and falls in after it, hitting his head on the boat. That accident became the \"triggering event\" for my story. And because the trigger happened on the lake, I could then imagine the next twist: Molly falling in love with her water-skiing best friend, even as her brother lies in a coma in the hospital. The story became her story--what she does as her family blames her and copes with their loss, whether she can accept the amazement of love in the midst of her guilt over her brother. All because of a simple writing exercise.Qualities of Light is now being typeset and the cover designed. It's going to be published by Spinsters Ink/Bella Books in August, the same month as much of the story on Cloud Lake takes place. I have to write Alison a thank-you note sometime, send her a copy when the novel is printed. I love her writing exercises, and I think you will too.To try it: make yourself two lists, one of people and one of items. Marry two things that don't go together. Shake them up, see what happens. Set a timer for 20 minutes for this writing session. It's bound to be a productive one."},
{"title": "Your Ideal Reader--Advice from Kurt Vonnegut", "date": "Tuesday, May 5, 2009", "text": "My ideal reader is a confused teenage girl; she feels like an outcast because her best friend just moved to Montana and nobody understands her at school or at home.My ideal reader is crazy about fixing old cars. He's got three in his backyard, if you could call it a backyard.My ideal reader is forty-two, a discouraged mother and homemaker who is looking for the spark in her life that disappeared too many years ago.My ideal reader manages an art gallery; she's fascinated with Renaissance art. She wants a new system for managing exhibits.My ideal reader is gay, single, and loves helping others. He volunteers at hospice and soup kitchens. He really wants to learn how to balance his life, though. It's too crazy...so he thinks my book will help him.Readers wait for your story, like a group of beautiful still life objects in an artist's studio. They wait for your attention, your interest in their particular shape and size and need. When you start thinking about them, your art changes. In a good way.As I write this, my class of twenty-seven book writers at the Loft Literary Center is exploring this question. They are busy researching this aspect of book-writing, one they may not have ever thought about. As they ask about their readers, the answers will shape their book journey--how the chapters are structured, what is added or omitted, what benefit (take-away) they present. Why would anyone read this book? Who is this \"anyone\" anyway?Write to Please One PersonKurt Vonnegut wrote, “Write to please just one person. If you open a window and make love to the world, so to speak, your story will get pneumonia.” When I heard this writing advice as a beginning writer, I couldn’t imagine what it meant. He’s a funny guy, but I didn’t see what was funny in this. Now that I’m an experienced book author, Vonnegut’s advice makes all the sense in the world.Many professional writers talk about this idea. Some visualize their ideal reader—maybe modeling her or him after someone they know. As they work on their book idea, they imagine asking that reader, What would you need here—more time to digest the idea or more information? More character or more plot? It’s not so far-fetched to begin this kind of dialogue. It’s, again, another guidance system to keep your book on track as it develops. You can also watch your reader’s profile change, as you discover more about what you really want to write.Vonnegut also said (both of these quotes are from his book, Bagombo Snuff Box: Uncollected Short Fiction, New York: G.P. Putnam's Sons, 1999), “Use the time of a total stranger in such a way that he or she will not feel the time was wasted.”This is another reason to consider a reader from the get-go. It’s unreasonable and a bit self-absorbed to think that a total stranger would take time to read your book, even if it’s fascinating to you, without being invested in its story.This week, think about your reader. Who will read your book, who will get the most from it? Spend ten minutes describing your ideal reader--what you know about him or her, what you'd like to know."},
{"title": "Being Stuck--Ideas on How to Work with Your Inner Critic", "date": "Monday, April 27, 2009", "text": "A reader wrote: \"I'm sure you hear this often--I'm stuck! I am great at first drafts, in fact I'm submerged in them. They never get anywhere. I found your site online and performed the \"Ophra\" asks exercise and it helped. I would love to attend your classes however geography does not permit. The internet may. Please let me know your thoughts. Thanks so far--it worked.\"Being stuck. How familiar that feeling is. Like trying to pass through a high-walled canyon. No way to travel easily.It happens to most of us, no matter how many books we write. I've published 13, and I still run into the frustration of writer's block with every new project. The difference is: I know it's happening. I prepare for it. I have a bag of tricks.Inner CriticIn each stage of writing your book, you’ll meet a most unsavory part of yourself: the Inner Critic. Single-handedly, the Inner Critic causes more cases of \"I'm stuck!\" than anything else.Some find themselves stuck in too much structuring, too tight a focus, and the book journey loses freedom. Others are stuck in the opposite arena--too much writing and no way to organize it. As you explore and plan your book, the Critic can even help you worry that you don’t have a good enough idea--so your writing never even gets started. Later on, it will hint you are seriously lacking in the skills to pull it into a book. And here's another one: As you write your book and form the chapters, it will convince you the draft is definitely good enough to show your best friend—right now, today! (This, of course, is a not-so-subtle sabotage attempt, made real when your friend asks about missing parts and you crumble with the realization that you have omitted half your story.)Even as you revise, the Critic will get bored with your book's inner story, theme, pacing--those essential fine-tuning steps each book writer must implement. It will begin to say things like, \"Edit out this part; all your friends and relations will shun you when they read them.\"I'm at the final stages of the book journey with my novel which will be published in August. I'm still facing this Inner Critic. Now the message is: Everyone will know what your life is like, what you are! Hide now!Writers beware. Get to know your own particular Inner Critic and how it delivers its sabotaging self-talk. Learn to feel the fear and write anyway.Here's a first step. Write a letter to the Inner Critic. Get to know it, what guise the Critic takes, how it stops you. Name it, describe it. Make a sketch of it. We'll tackle more Inner Critic tools in future posts. But let me know how this one worked for you."},
{"title": "Why Books Aren't Just about Shooting in the Dark--And a Writing Exercise to Prove It", "date": "Tuesday, April 21, 2009", "text": "Five weekends each year, I travel from my home in Connecticut to Minnesota, to teach book-writing structure at the Loft Literary Center in Minneapolis (http://www.loft.org/). I gather thirty-five would-be book writers who want some light in the darkness. We spend two days together in a classroom and come out with our personal book-writing plans, a workable structure and step-by-step method to creating and crafting a novel, memoir, or nonfiction book.I love teaching at the Loft. The Loft is unique. I've taught at university and college, art center and private school, but nothing is like the Loft. It's the largest nonprofit writing school in the U.S., offering hundreds of classes and writerly events each year. I've been proud to be part of the Loft's teaching artists staff for nine years.Two of my own books have gotten healthy beginnings from Loft classes. My novel, Qualities of Light, which will be published this August, was launched via a class with Loft instructor Alison McGhee (author of Shadow Baby and other novels).I'm packing today for my workshops at the Loft this coming weekend, April 24-26. Friday and Saturday, I'm teaching the most popular of my Loft workshops, a two-day intensive on \"How to Plan, Write, and Develop a Book.\" I wish I'd had this workshop when I began writing and publishing books in the 1980s. I didn't have much back then, just hopes, fears, and book ideas. Somehow I published, but it wasn't easy. It's still not easy but at least now I have a method, a strategy. It's not just shooting in the dark.I want to make book writing simpler for any writer. In my Loft workshop, this group of 35 book writers will be mixed, in skill and achievement. Some have manuscripts drafted, some only have an idea. During the two days, we create the structure of our books via tested writing exercises. We start with tag lines, move to writing segments that develop the inner and outer story, then craft linear and nonlinear storyboards.By day 2 of the workshop, writers are jazzed. That's when their books become real. They are really going to happen.Maybe you'll be joining me this coming weekend. If you'd like to, call the Loft at 612-379-8999 and get your name on the list. There are 9 places left, as of this writing. You'll be among the greatest book writers in one of the greatest writing schools. It's fun, inspiring, and creative.Mostly, it's a wake-up call about how books are really written. Writing a book is not just about hoping for the best--although hope does factor in. There's a real formula, a real strategy. I've seen very beginning writers follow this strategy and come out with a good, solid book. One just published last month. She is not alone. My favorite experience is when a writer appears at my workshop, someone who took the class a year or two ago, and hands me a copy of their published book. I love the look of pride on their face.Books take hard work, of course, and dedication. But having a strategy makes it possible. Otherwise, you're just shooting in the dark.Writing a Focus StatementHere's the opening exercise from the workshop. It's easiest if I am there to coach you through it, but try it on your own if you can't join us this weekend at the Loft. Set a kitchen timer for 20 minutes and write three paragraphs about your book--everything you think it's about. Then read it outloud to yourself. Find the sentence that is most interesting to you, that speaks to you, that maybe surprises you. Underline it.Using this sentence, craft a statement about your book. This is your focus statement, elevator speech, tag line. Your answer to Oprah's question, \"What's your book really about?\" Make sure you create a statement that contains the book's outer story (event or method) as well as its inner story (answer to a quest or question).Post it where you can see it. Let it be your light during the book-writing journey. It will be simpler to navigate the trip."},
{"title": "The Beauty of Regular Writing Practice--Watching Your Book Grow", "date": "Monday, April 13, 2009", "text": "Writing practice is like walking a path and not knowing exactly where you're going, but enjoying the journey. To paraphrase my yoga teacher, writing practice is not writing perfect.Perfect means you have it all under control. Practice means you're willing to make mistakes to get to a goal. Practice is about sitting in the chair, putting words on the page, letting mistakes happen. Letting miracles happen too.In Thunder and Lightning, Natalie Goldberg wrote of a time when she and a friend were in the dumps. They first tried a long hike to cure it. That didn’t work. They sat zazen (meditating), but both women still felt bad. Finally, Natalie suggested writing practice. “We wrote for half an hour, read to each other, wrote another half hour, read aloud,” she said. “By the end we were both beaming. Writing practice had done it again—digested our sorrows, dissolved and integrated our inner rigidity, and let us move on.”Goldberg adds “Writing practice lets out all your wild horses. Everything you never dared to utter—didn’t even know you thought—comes galloping and whinnying across the page. This is good. You become connected with a much larger force field, one where you’re not in control.”Not being in control: that's what practice is all about.In my writing class today, we practiced practice. We did three 10-minute freewriting exercises. I asked the writers to pick a line from their homework that stood out in some way, write it at the top of their page, then write for 10 minutes--nondirected practice. They tried it again.  The third 10-minute freewriting session, writing got looser, more interesting. Discoveries were made.Writing practice has worked for me more times than I can count—and I certainly often can’t remember what I wrote about during these freewriting sessions. Although they have produced many books, stories, and articles, that wasn’t the point of the practice. The practice itself was the point, the rhythm it gave to my writing life.This non-directed practice is called automatic writing by Peter Elbow (author of Writing without Teachers) and Lynn Lauber (author of Listen to Me), freewriting by Natalie Goldberg and others. Try it yourself this week. Pick a \"prompt\" (starting phrase or sentence) from your favorite piece of writing. Set a kitchen timer for 10 minutes, and go for it."},
{"title": "Why Book Writers Need to Hang Out Together", "date": "Wednesday, April 8, 2009", "text": "I teach weekly writing classes for book writers at the Hudson Valley Writers' Center in Westchester County near New York City. The beginning class, meeting each Monday afternoon for six weeks, draws a range of skill and experience levels. Some writers come in with a good idea, encouragement from friends and family (\"You should write a book!\"), expertise in a topic, or a group of characters who won't leave them alone. I take the group through a series of writing exercises to determine where their real story lies.It's the tools in the class that start the process of discovery. But it's the gathering of other writers, those specifically working on books, which lends clarity and inspiration. The class discussions, the helping of each other, bring very interesting results which reveal to the writer (and me, the teacher) where the real stall-out is.One woman in my class, a brilliant ex-journalist (and I've changed details here to protect her privacy), was writing about an entertainment world legend. She had put together ten chapters then stopped for some reason. Nothing moved the book forward, so she came to my class to figure out why. Over the six weeks, she discovered that she was deeply afraid of ridicule from fellow reporters and of making some monumental mistake in reporting accuracy. Her award-winning newspaper and magazine were pieces of cake compared to a book. How could she ever create copy that was interesting enough to hold a reader for 300 pages? More importantly, how would she keep all those piles of research accurate?Navigating this writer's block came about through discussion with thirteen other struggling book writers and ended her procrastination on her manuscript.I've taught this weekly class for many years. I'm fascinated, at the beginning of each session, how varied the group of writers is. We are usually between twelve and fifteen people. We meet for three hours once a week for six weeks. By the end of the session, we are often changed inside. The books we write reveal ourselves, our deepest fears and longings, whether they are fiction, nonfiction, or memoir. Good books put the writer on the page. They can't help it--they have to.I'm starting a new session in May. Already writers are signing up, coming from around the East Coast. Some drive in for an overnight to attend the class, and when I am amazed at this, the writer tells me, \"There aren't very many classes like these. My friend took it last year and raved about it. And her book is actually finished now.\" I hear many stories like this, because we, as a group, are unique. We specifically address the strange and wonderful needs of the book writer.I know these classes keep me writing! I have two books coming out this summer, and I am thanking my classes for the inspiration and momentum to keep going on them over the past few years.If you want to join us for the next session of \"How to Plan, Write, and Develop a Book,\" here are the specifics: 6 Mondays, 1:30-4:30 p.m., May 4-June 22 (skips May 18 & 25), $355, at the Hudson Valley Writers' Center in Sleepy Hollow, NY (near Tarrytown). Visit http://www.writerscenter.org/, email info@writerscenter.org, or call 914-332-5953 to register. Class size is limited, and this one usually sells out. So call soon. Maybe you'll find the missing key to finishing your book, as you are supported and encouraged by this wonderful group of fellow writers.If you're too distant to join us, try an exercise from the class. Consider the writerly support in your life. Write for ten minutes about how you are encouraged, motivated, and appropriately mirrored in your efforts to write your book. Where does your support come from--and where might it be missing?Writers, especially book writers, need each other. It's essential to hang out together so we realize (1) we're not going crazy in this book-writing process, (2) it actually demands more of us than we might first believe and there are specific tools to get stronger, and (3) we can keep going when the going gets tough."},
{"title": "If You Dream It, They Will Publish It?  An Exercise in Dreaming Your Book Cover", "date": "Tuesday, March 31, 2009", "text": "A couple of years ago, I dreamed up a book cover for my novel. I spent an hour with some colored pencils and nice paper, drew and wrote and typed and pasted. I drew a lake shore, since the story is about a lake in late summer when the birches are just turning yellow. It was great fun. I even made up \"blurbs,\" those bright one- or two-liners full of nice comments from famous writers about the story.I put the book cover above my desk. I think I was struggling with my fifth draft then and seeing the cover made me hopeful it would someday be published.Fast forward, book travels the rounds of agents and publishers for over a year, despair sets in, but book finally gets accepted. Editor is great, loves it, edits it, sends her suggestions. I am impressed: my novel's better than ever.We exchange a happy flurry of emails, like people do when a baby's coming. Excitement, anticipation, overwhelm.The book goes into production, gets typeset. Release date is planned. We ask famous writers for blurbs. We talk cover art, jacket copy. I imagine what it'll be like to hold this book in my hand in August.Each time, this process of birthing a book is both terrifying and lovely. Each publisher is different; some communicate a lot with the writer, some don't. My editor is sending emails, telling me in the same week, \"I just love this book. What a superb writer you are,\" and \"Do you have any ideas around cover art?\"Relief. She's been microscopically involved for months and she still loves it. Gulp. Cover art?Then I remember my book cover exercise. I dig it out of some file. It gives me ideas. I open files of photos and images, go on line for free stock images, dream my cover again. Send her some ideas, which she likes. The cover is born.But it make me wonder: Which comes first, the dream or the published book? Does dreaming your book (and its cover) create an open door for it to be published? Some people believe that what you imagine, you bring into manifestation, good or bad. Maybe you don't buy this, but in my experience, positive imaging certainly doesn't hurt.So, try it this week. Design your book cover. See what happens.Exercise: Set aside an hour, grab a piece of paper or open up your desktop graphics program, and play. Make up blurbs (those two-liners from famous people) for your cover, write your jacket copy, imagine your book published."},
{"title": "What's the \"Me\" in Memoir?--Avoiding Overwriting When You're Writing about Your Life", "date": "Wednesday, March 18, 2009", "text": "Memoirs--sometimes they feel to us writers like we're talking to ourselves, not seeing the forest for the trees.  But isn't that what memoir is?  Or is it?   What exactly is a memoir? And how does a writer become \"the writer\" and not \"The Writer\" (see last week's post,  below, on the dangers of The Writer's presence in books)?A reader from Louisiana wrote this about last week's post and writing exercise: \"I don't really know what a memoir is supposed to be. Am I not suppose to write about my experiences, what I saw, felt, and thought? Have I been writing all this too much as an ego trip? Should I tell the story as if it is someone else, using the word she rather than I? Should I just forget thinking of it as a book, write it simply for a possible interested family member after I'm gone?\" Excellent question. It was triggered by this writer's concern that she was supposed to absent herself from her own story, and how was that possible? I wrote last week's post (see below) about writers who are way too present in their stories, who take on two roles: (1) they sit the center-stage to tell their story AND (2) they stand on the sidelines to interpret the story for us readers. In memoir, you are the main character (makes sense, doesn't it?). You fill the center-stage role. But if you are nervous about whether readers will \"get\" the message of your story, you might be tempted to be the stage manager as well. This is the mistake.Alison Smith, author of the wonderful Name All the Animals, wrote about becoming aware of her role in this memoir. Her original drafts were more about her brother's sudden death than about her own life, but she soon realized she was leaving herself out of her own story. The death was the memoir's \"triggering event\" (in book-writing language, what started the story). How the death affected Alison and her family was the story itself. She had to assume the center-stage role. Memoir is about me.But it's not about me plus ME (center stage plus stage manager). The writer is important, but not The Writer.Alison never tries to put herself between the reader and her story. She isn't constantly interpreting what's happening, making sure the reader gets it. Some writing instructors call this \"overwriting\"--you are writing, then you are making sure we get it by repeating what you just wrote, saying it in another way--overwriting your words. \"Betty ran her finger down the wall and checked for dust.\" What does that tell you? She's neat, fastidious even, obsessive maybe. The writer doesn't need to add \"Betty was obsessed with cleanliness.\" Yes, in a memoir you feel, think, say, do. But instead of adding more about why you are feeling, thinking, saying, and doing the thing, you just let the story show it. You don't need to interpret if the actions are strong. We get it. Another way to look at this: Actions, events, and dialogue shows us. No need to tell us, as well. Keep yourself in your memoir, by all means. But take out The Writer who is on the sidelines, stage managing, telling us what it all means. Confusing and unnecessary at best; obnoxious at worst.Read some examples if you want. A few great memoirs that feature a strong main character (the writer) but no interpretation (The Writer) for the story are:Alison Smith's Name All the AnimalsVivian Gornick's Fierce AttachmentsFrank McCourt's Angela's AshesDani Shapiro's Slow MotionNuala O'Faolain's Almost ThereClosely read a chapter. Notice if you feel the author's presence interpreting the actions and being too present in the story--taking away from your engagement with the book."},

Read This!", "date": "Monday, March 16, 2009", "text": "I finished a big freelance editing project today so I treated myself to a bowl of popcorn, a movie, and a good read: the altogether quirky My So-Called Freelance Life by anti 9-5er and freelance writer, Michelle Goodman. Lots of great advice, and Michelle's entertaining style takes a potentially boring subject to new heights.I loved her frank assessment of freelancing--you can't live in la-la land, hoping for the creative gold all the time, so grab some bread-and-butter work while you're working toward your dream.Are you struggling to thrive as a freelancer in this economy? Visit her online at http://www.anti9to5guide.com/ and let me know what you think.Today in my class at the Hudson Valley Writers' Center in Westchester Co., NY,we talked about moving from a writer-centric viewpoint to a reader-centric one. It's a natural part of a writer's evolution. A maturing, where we begin to see why someone else would read our book (besides our mother, best friend, and partner/spouse). In other words, we begin to write for a reader.This isn't about compromising your ideals. It isn't about not telling your truth. It's about becoming less self-focused.An odd idea, for us writers. Aren't writers supposed to be self-focused? After all, that's where we get the juice--from our lives and our imaginations.When I got my novel manuscript back from my editor (see my overwhelmed post below), I realized the book was a stranger to me. I was no longer on center stage, as The Writer. The story had now become my reader's. I almost didn't remember writing certain parts. These, of course, were the parts my editor liked best.What happened? In the editing and revising stages, I'd moved out of the \"room\" and all that remained was my story--and an open door, welcoming my reader. I hate books--and wonder how they ever got published--where the writer is The Writer, on his or her soapbox, telling us what to think about every moment in the story. Don't you? But how do you, the writer, get out of the room where your story lives? How do you convince yourself that it doesn't need you there, acting as interpretor for your own story?Know what I'm talking about?

{"title": "My New Novel Is Coming Out--And I'm Trying to Breathe Deeply!", "date": "Tuesday, March 10, 2009", "text": "I just got the big packet every writer waits for--edited pages of my soon-to-be released novel, Qualities of Light. My super-duper editor, Katherine Forrest, sent them to me for a look over and corrections. Katherine is so good at what she does and I value editors highly, but still there's a bit of a catch in the breath when I open the package and see what needs changing. She tells me over and over in the cover note, \"This is a really fine novel,\" and then makes her suggestions.I'm used to this. I've been a professional editor since 1986. It's part of the job. An editor only hopes for a cooperative writer, who can hold her original vision for the book--and release it for a better one.So I took a big breath, undid the tape, shook out the contents. She loved it! Wow...And she had great (great!) suggestions. Tiny places to tweak, small moments to clarify, little adjustments here and there. It is making the novel really sing. After I read through everything, accepting 99.9 % of Katherine's suggestions, I looked back in my writing notebook at my présumé exercise. I wrote it three weeks ago, on one of those snowbound days of deep writerly despair, when I didn't really believe my novel would be published, ever, ever. The présumé said this:\"April 15, 2009: Everything is moving along beautifully with my novel and publication. Katherine's edits are amazing, I'm grateful for all her insights and suggestions, and we're in good communication.\" April 15, huh? Guess I was behind the timetable of the universe. Not a surprise. Présumés often happen early, in more delightful ways than we can imagine. They work because they let us let go. Once we let go the stranglehold on our creative project, lots of amazing \"coincidences\" occur.You don't have to believe me. For this week's exercise, just try the présumé you didn't do last month (see post below) and make it short, sweet, and focused on something you really want to happen in your writing. Just a couple of sentences, written in present tense, as if you are looking back from a future date and feeling great about what's happened. You can post your présumé here, so we can cheer you on!"},

It's great that someone else is there with tips to aid the process — at least agents are now looking past my query letters.\"Adele has published and won awards for her writing; from her years of experience as a professional editor, she wanted to share these common sense tips for writers:For narrative: Write with your experience, not about it (especially for people with a journalism or nonfiction background, writing needs to be writing, not reportage).In a similar vein, tell a story; don't report the facts.For varied points of view: Make sure to \"inhabit\" all your characters, and use a different voice for each to distinguish one from another.About dialogue: In a Hemingway kind of approach, most dialogue is about what we don't communicate, not about what we do communicate.Thanks, Adele!

{"title": "Key West Collage Exercise--Nonlinear Book Structuring Fun", "date": "Tuesday, February 24, 2009", "text": "Island life is great. I'm at the Coffee Plantation in Key West, Florida, relaxing in 80-degree island breezes, enjoying a day off after my three-day workshop at The Studios at Key West. Our workshop group was wonderful--energetic, intelligent, insightful about their very varied book projects. We had writers of all skill levels, professional to beginner, and a variety of books--novels, memoirs, art books, how-to books, and true crime. Our writing exercises and discussion revolved around book structuring, trying to figure out the outer and inner stories, and surviving through the long committment of bringing a book into the world. After we covered the basics of book-structuring, I asked them to try a pair of activities to engage both the right and left creative brain: toggle between creating a book storyboard and creating a book collage.They dove in. Many began with the collage, a relaxing and free-form, right-brain activity. Some went for the more linear storyboard first. After an hour, we all switched to the other task. I loved walking around the beautiful studio space, visiting the writers as they worked at their tables. By Saturday afternoon, storyboards were forming but the collages were really coming together. Each was as colorful and unique as its creator. I'd cut out hundreds of magazine photos before the workshop, spread them on a large counter, and encouraged the writers to browse the images, letting their intution guide them. I was watching to see how they arranged their images on the large posterboards--what order they would choose.Before we ended the session that afternoon, we studied the group's collages. I taught them the squint test: hold the collage away from you, squint, see if any images create obvious pathways. Having taught this exercise for years in workshops, I knew that often a clear path emerges on a very randomly created collage. Pathways can start at the bottom right or left, lead to the opposite corner. Sometimes the path is circular. Often there's a strong angle or series of connecting colors. Sheila Asato (http://www.monkeybridgearts.com/) told me how she uses collage pathways for dreamwork. The collage often reveals good information about the unconscious part of our art. And when quizzed by the workshop group, many writers agreed that the pathways made sense. The beginning and ending images indeed reflected a beginning and ending moment of their books.Do you know how to make a collage? This week's exercise is to try one. Collages are powerful tools to get at clues about where your book should start and end. Even if you know this \"secret\" about how your right-brain creates pathways in this exercise, play with a collage for your book-in-progress or your writing in general. You'll need a posterboard, a few magazines, scissors, and a glue stick. Spend 30 minutes leafing through the magazines, cutting out any photos that grab you. Don't analyze why--no need. Just collect. Then spread them out and begin pasting on your posterboard. This takes 30-45 minutes, usually. Let yourself be nonlinear. Swim like the island sea turtles through clear blue-green water and let random images approach you, like the bright yellow fish in the photo above. Let your intuition create the collage. When your collage feels complete, take a break. Then come back to it, try the squint test, and see if you notice any pathways. What do the images at the start and end tell you about your book's opening, your book's conclusion?"},
{"title": "Writing a Great Query Letter and Book Proposal", "date": "Tuesday, February 17, 2009", "text": "A good book proposal is like handing an agent a perfect rosebud. It smells wonderful, it hints of much more. It's meant to entice, stimulate, and promise. Your goal with your book proposal is the same. You only want one thing: Get the agent asking for the whole manuscript.Book proposals have two elements: (1) a great query letter and (2) the proposal packet. Great Query LettersA query letter is sent first, by itself, before you send the proposal. Queries are one-page, single-spaced documents that sell the concept of your book in exciting language. Many agents now accept emailed query letters, but check their web site guidelines.Query letters are not easy to write. Plan to take some time with yours. One agent I know receives two hundred query letters each week. Often there are only a few minutes to spare to read yours.A query letter has three parts: (1) sales pitch for your book, (2) a short bio, and (3) why you are approaching this agent. For the sales pitch, I start by crafting a short sentence that describes my book--what is it about. Expand that sentence to two or three dynamite paragraphs. Then add what gives you the credentials to write this book, your writing experience or life experience. This makes up the body of your query letter.It's essential to add one sentence from your research of the agent’s work: tell her why you want to work with her, specifically. Mention a book she represented that you liked. Some writers wonder: Why not work into it gradually, maybe beginning with a sentence like “I love your agency and would love it if you represented my book”? If you’re the agent who gets two hundred query letters a day, imagine reading the “I love” sentence two hundred times a day. The letter would go straight into the round file. It’s essential to make that first sentence engaging, even electrifying—and about your book. You worked long and hard on that premise statement; now use it.The goal is obvious. You want the agent (or agent’s assistant who screens query letters) to read on. In Making the Perfect Pitch (edited by Katherine Sands), you can read some dynamite query letter openers, such as:“I am a Vietnamese American man, a witness to the fall of Saigon, a prisoner of war, an escapee, a first-generation immigrant, and an eternal refugee.”--from Catfish & Mandala by Andrew X. Pham (memoir) “When all the kids around him were coming of age, Robin MacKenzie was coming undone.”--from The World of Normal Boys by K.M. Soehnlein (novel)The Proposal PacketOut of twenty agents queried, you may get a few who want to see your proposal packet. This packet contains a synopsis that gives the substance of your book, a chapter outline, platform (marketing niche) information if your book is nonfiction, and sample chapters, or the “partial.”Proposal packets must contain your very best work. One publisher I spoke with said their editors read the first two pages only—and if the editor isn't grabbed immediately, the proposal is rejected. So polish carefully.  Read these two bibles to proposal crafting: How to Write a Book Proposal, by Michael Larson, and Write the Perfect Book Proposal, by Jeff Hermann. Although geared toward nonfiction writers, there’s great information in these. Larson’s book is a classic, reprinted often. Hermann’s book is unique because it gives ten proposals that actually sold. You can read the packets and see what’s in them—and how fine-tuned the language must be to capture an agent’s attention.Fiction and Memoir Proposal Packets contain:cover letter (your query letter can be reshaped)bio (one page)chapter outline (one to two pages, with two brief sentences about each chapter)synopsis (one-page overview of the plot and meaning of your story)sample chapters (usually two, or between fifty and one hundred pages)Nonfiction Proposal Packets contain: All the above plus:platform plan and marketing analysis (how you’ll help sell your book)competitive titles (six to eight books in your field, published recently, and why yours is unique)Writing the SynopsisThere's much differing opinion on this part of the proposal. Some agents like to read three or four pages, with detailed information. Most, in my experience, prefer a well-crafted and focused one pager. Start with your expanded premise statement from your query letter. Use that to design your synopsis. Then go through the book's outline, chapter by chapter, and pick the major points--either plot points for fiction or memoir or theory and application for nonfiction. I choose five or six, write a paragraph on each, then edit it like crazy. You want really, really captivating language here. Synopses should give an agent confidence that you can tell your story in a way that keeps a reader engaged through the last page. Don't give away the entire story--you want to be sure this proposal packet leads the agent to ask for more. You want to deliver the complete manuscript next.More questions? Post them here and I'll try to answer next week."},

Where are all these chapters going? What's the book really about? What's the point?Toggling between seeing the trees to seeing the forest is an important skill that book writers develop.A book writer uses the right brain to create scenes and snippets. This keeps most writers happy for a while. The task is to hold off needing to organize these bits and pieces, because during the nonlienar process, the right brain gets to inform the writing about the \"inner story,\" or the underlying meaning. Meaning develops theme in most books.You've probably done this random writing. Kenneth Atchity calls it \"islands\" and Natalie Goldberg calls it\"freewriting.\" It's a wonderful part of most books. I wrote my first five books without this method, and I suffered. But there's a point of critical mass: the sheer volume of writing accumulated in these freewrites becomes overwhelming. We grow desperate to move away from the trees and see the forest.Enter storyboarding. Storyboards are used in filmmaking to diagram the plot or arc of a movie. Publishers also use them. I was hired by publishing companies in 1990s to design books by storyboarding a topic the publisher decided they wanted to produce. Once the book was storyboarded, a writer-for-hire put it together. It was a common practice.I learned a lot from storyboarding. Below are the steps I use. See if they might help with your book-writing process--and give you a good glimpse of forest instead of trees. If you get confused, feel free to write me an SOS email at mary@marycarrollmoore.com. And if you want hands-on practice, join me in Key West next weekend!Storyboarding Steps1. Print out all the sections you’ve written for your book.2. Cut the sections apart so each covers only one scene, idea, anecdote, point of view, or location. Write a cue card for each. Put the manuscript pages aside.3. Go through the cue cards until you find your triggering event*. Place this card in the upper left-hand corner of your poster board.4. Scan the remaining cue cards until you find your integration moment**. 5. Place this card in the lower right-hand corner of your poster board.6. Arrange the remaining cue cards on the storyboard, creating a flow that fits your book at this moment.7. Place blank cue cards for any missing sections.* Triggering event: the moment without which the story wouldn't exist.**Integration moment: what you want to leave the reader with."},
{"title": "Ken Atchity's Brilliant Book-Structuring Method", "date": "Tuesday, February 3, 2009", "text": "I was thrilled to have a visit on my blog from a writing mentor, Ken Atchity, who authored A Writer's Time, one of the textbooks used in my book-structuring classes. Ken introduced me to the concept of writing in \"islands,\" which makes use of random as well as linear structuring.If you haven't come across A Writer's Time, be sure to get a copy and read the first five chapters.  It'll open your eyes to a brilliant method to organize a new book idea.Visit Ken's blog for a great post by Garrison Keillor.  http://kenatchity.blogspot.comIn her book, Thunder and Lightning, free-writing expert Natalie Goldberg describes a writing exercise she created after reading Borrowed Time by Paul Monette. Borrowed Time is a memoir of Monette's experience with AIDS.When one of her students commented that AIDS gave Monette his voice as a writer, Goldberg realized that voice is created when \"something crosses our lives, brings us to our knees.\"His partner's diagnosis of AIDS brought Monette to his knees, and Goldberg writes, \"All this cut across his throat and released his voice.\"So Goldberg asked her class two questions: What has brought you to your knees? What do you love with your whole heart?How do we mature as writers, develop our voice? Goldberg proposes that some combination of deep love and aching loss brings us to this place where we deliver story in some unique way. We become different, not only in what we say but how we choose to say it. What we omit, what we focus on.What loss has come into your life? Make a list. See how it has shaped you.Now list any gifts that came from these losses. What do you love with your whole heart, without reservation?If you haven't read Goldberg's Thunder and Lightning, get a copy. If you want to explore the origins of your own creative voice, try these two questions this week. Watch how your writing changes."},
{"title": "Show, Don't Tell--What Does That Really Mean?", "date": "Tuesday, January 27, 2009", "text": "Imagine trying to describe the image to the left. Lights swirling all over a black background? Winter wheat in a field, caught by the last sun?  What could possibly convey the movement and delicacy of this photograph to someone who hasn't seen it?  That's basically what we writers are up against. We're trying to convey the emotional truth of a moment to readers who've never been there. Some writers do this by telling about the moment. \"She was depressed after he died.\" \"He never felt so excited.\" But this telling doesn't really put us, the reader, in that moment. We're still observing from a distance. When you translate telling into showing, the reader comes into the same room with the story.\"She was depressed after he died\" becomes \"One day Mollie drew the curtains on the daylight and did not ever draw them back again\" (William Trevor, \"At Olivehill\" from Cheating at Canasta). \"He never felt so excited\" becomes \"His skin was now flushed, his eyes sparking. He leaned into the provocation\" (Vivian Gornick, \"At the University\" from Approaching Eye Level). See the difference? It's great writing, but why? Because it places us there, with the people in the story, not telling but showing.This week find a passage, a sentence, a phrase where you backed off, out of the room of your story. Bring yourself and your reader back. Translate the telling into showing.PS  Go out and find the two books mentioned above.  Fabulous writing, great winter reading."},
{"title": "Winter Writing--A Chance to Slow Way Down", "date": "Tuesday, January 20, 2009", "text": "Outside my office window, the snow is coming down fast. I cancelled a dentist appointment today, shoveled the steps, walked to the mailbox, but mostly I'm reveling in being snowbound. It gives me no excuse not to slow down. Slowing down is great for my writing. A naturally speedy person, I tend to get bored with passages where I should linger longer. So I use snow to lull my fast-paced mind into that drifty dreamy place my characters often need. What slows you down? We're not talking coma level, just slowed to the place where you appreciate--and can write--the finer details. This week's exercise will help you notice how your book comes alive in the small things that you might notice more as you slow your pace.1. Put on some music that lets you drift.2. Don't look at emails, Facebook, or My Space for 20 minutes--force yourself!3. Look around the room you're in. Begin noting what you see.4. Then pay attention to sounds. Note what you hear.5. If you can, add temperature and texture--the touch sense. Or smell.6. Do this while breathing. Deeply if you can.What's the difference in your writing?"},
{"title": "Reverse Goal-Setting:  Magic Action for Writers", "date": "Tuesday, January 13, 2009", "text": "Goal-setting doesn't work for many book writers. Maybe we're too random. Maybe we need more flexibility than traditional goal-setting allows. Even those of us who love lists rebel three months into a prescribed plan. Our books are evolving in a new way, and the plan doesn't fit.Enter Reverse Goal-Setting. With Reverse Goal-Setting, you start from the end and work backwards. You get flexibility. You get chances to adjust and modify as you go. You also get a reality check--and you create writing goals that are actually possible to achieve and still stay sane and happy in your larger life arena (with family, friends, work responsibilities).Want to try it? Using the presume you did last week (see post below this one) you can launch your Reverse Goal-Setting pretty easily. If you didn't do last week's exercise, take time to do it now (10 minutes max) then come back.Get a large sheet of paper. Create 12 columns or boxes, one for each month of 2009. Label them by the months, from January to December.Starting with December's column, review your year-end goal from your presume. Ask yourself: What would have to happen in December for this January 2010 goal to be realized? Write three tasks for December 2009.Move back one month to November 2009. What would have to happen in November for December's goal to be realized? Write three tasks for November.And so forth. You get the picture. Continue backwards through the months until you get to now, January 2009.Here comes the reality check. Look at where you are now, with your writing in its present state, with your other responsibilities. Is your year-end goal reasonable, even possible? Is it too big or too small? Does it feel good, well aligned with your other creative goals and your life responsibilities?Modify, add, reduce, adjust as needed, until the year-end goal in your presume feels accurate and just enough of a stretch.I learned this the hard way: Success in goal-setting is all about being accurate. It's also about adjusting the goal so you can succeed. Each time you succeed, your self-esteem as a creative person goes way up. Using Reverse Goal-Setting makes it easier to see where you're going to succeed with your writing goals--and where you're not."},

I even know--I think!--where to take them next.\"Martha: \"This year has been good for my writing in that I finally understand what this book is about. By February, I worked out a regular writing schedule, which I kept to more or less, and B. and the kids have been very supportive.\"Celeste: \"After some deep thinking, I realized I needed a break from the book and took a couple of really outstanding poetry classes.

Does this happen to you? Maybe it's because the right brain engages, that non-linear side of our creative selves.  This week, I spent many lovely hours immersed in a book that talks about this right-brain gift to creative folks:  My Stroke of Insight by Jill Bolte Taylor.  Dr. Taylor is a brain scientist who wrote about having a left-brain stroke that changed her entire way of being in the world.

{"title": "Ongoing Spirit of Gratitude--A Thanksgiving Writing Exercise", "date": "Tuesday, November 25, 2008", "text": "A book-writing client talked with me this week about having an ongoing spirit of gratitude for her characters. She regularly notes on paper what she appreciates about them. She also works as a newspaper reporter. Her interviews are always full of understanding of the people she profiles and their situations.She believes this spirit of appreciation sparks unspoken cooperation between writer and subject—whether that subject is memory, imaginative, or factual.Make use of the annual holiday of Thanksgiving for your writing exercise this week, by writing each day for 2-3 minutes about what you appreciate. This is sometimes called a gratitude journal.Writers use gratitude journals to unblock their creativity. Gratitude is simple, easily forgotten, more powerful than expected when you practice it. With our creativity, it fosters a kind of deeper understanding and appreciation about our lives, what we specifically offer the world, what’s unique about that offering and why it matters.Each evening before bed, list three things you felt grateful for that day. You can focus, as the book writer above does, on what you’re grateful for about your book, your characters, the topic you’re exploring. Or just your life.Keep going with this exercise for seven days.

More awareness of what’s actually working, what you’re doing well.This sounds like a lightweight activity. It’s not. It’s potent. I’ve keep a gratitude journal for many years.

{"title": "Writing Exercise--Pace Yourself via Expansion or Contraction", "date": "Tuesday, November 18, 2008", "text": "Pacing—a delicate affair in writing a book—depends on a balance of expanded and contracted moments. Good pacing creates a rhythm between the two. This week’s exercise lets you notice your natural (often unconscious) tendency of either expanding or contracting too much. If you adjust, correct, and balance, your writing will soar.1. Set a kitchen timer for fifteen minutes. Begin to write about a childhood event that influenced you greatly. Don’t overthink this exercise, just let it rip. No editing along the way! 2. Read the piece out loud. Whenever you get interested, as you read, highlight the paragraph that pulled you in. (It’s essential to read out loud—you’re switching from a writer’s viewpoint to a reader’s.) 3. Contract (condense) the paragraph into one sentence, as short as possible, without losing the essence of the larger paragraph. 4. Now expand this one sentence into five new sentences (a new paragraph). Which was easier for you, expansion or contraction? Think about whether this short exercise helped you see anything about your natural tendency as a writer. 5. Return to your original freewrite about the childhood experience. Select your favorite section, a paragraph or two. 6. Apply the aspect (expand or contract) that was the most difficult for you in steps 3 and 4. If you had trouble with expansion, expand the section to three or more paragraphs. If you had trouble with contraction, condense the section to half its length.Read the new writing out loud. Can you notice the difference in flow, in music, in pacing?"},

But we are trained in school to communicate with words first. Images are considered random, illogical, somewhat dangerous. In my experience, writer’s block occurs when we become too word-based. Freeing ourselves requires tuning into our natural, childlike ability to perceive images.This week, explore the two languages we use as writers: the language of words and the language of images. Both are necessary to a good book.For ten minutes, pay attention to images around you. What can you perceive when you remind yourself of details perceived via the five senses?"},

{"title": "Does Your Writing Show or Tell?  Learn from Robert Olen Butler", "date": "Tuesday, October 21, 2008", "text": "Anton Chekhov wrote, “Don’t tell me the moon is shining; show me the glint of light on broken glass.” Showing is a demonstration of emotion through specific details. Telling can bring in an almost intellectual assessment of what happened. Showing, the opposite, requires very little intellectual language. It relies instead on sensory detail (smells, sights, sounds).   While telling backs away from the moment, summarizing feelings from a distance, showing places the reader squarely in it.  The key to showing is to demonstrate. This means not interpreting the things you are placing in front of us. Robert Olen Butler, author of many wonderful stories and novels and instructor at this writing at Florida State University’s MFA program, talks about this in his book From Where You Dream (Grove/Atlantic, Inc., 2005). To deliver emotion in its purest form, don’t dilute it with interpretation. Butler observed that emotion can be delivered to a reader (shown, versus told) generally in five ways. Here is my translation of his terms:• what I am feeling inside my body (goosebumps on my arm, itchy foot, tight throat)• what I am observing in your gestures and movements (tearing a small paper napkin into bits, jiggling foot)• specific memory• fear, anticipation, desire (projections into future)• sense selectivity (during moments of extreme emotion, all but one sense goes away)During the developing stage of book writing, whenever I need to change a scene to more “showing,” I will go through Butler’s list and ask myself how I can bring in one of these. This week, translate a passage that \"tells\" into one that \"shows,\" using one of the above techniques.  What happened?"},
{"title": "Your Creative Vocal Chords--How to Warm Them Up", "date": "Tuesday, October 14, 2008", "text": "William Wordsworth said, \"Fill your paper with the breathings of your heart.\"  We're not all poets.  But all of us have these breathings of the heart, which some call voice.Voice is your passion, your style, the things you must write, the way you must write them.  But voice can easily be squelched.  It can go through silent passages, coming out in a mere whisper.  The biggest problem in silent passages is that you don’t know they’re happening at first. They start innocently—a tiny bit of boredom with your characters, a chapter that feels rough with no inspiring fixes. These pile up and an overactive Inner Critic can make them seem worse. Slowly the silence inside the writer grows, until words trickle to a stop.Educator Steve Peha from Teaching That Makes Sense http://www.ttms.org/ says voice is a combination of choices a writer makes. In other subjects, we all learn the same rules and theories.  Think:  math equations, history facts.  Creative writing is supposed to showcase the individual and how individual they can be and still communicate well. “Everyone’s writing needs to be different from everyone else’s,” writes Peha. “The set of all the different choices a writer makes, and the collective effect they have on the reader, is what is often called ‘voice’ in a piece of writing.” Choices include your style of language, the words you use, the length of your sentences and paragraphs, tone.  Just like in conversation.And conversation--with yourself--is the key.  Having a regular writing practice is the single most important way to gain and belief in yourself, and keep the writing voice warmed up. This week, try writing every day for 5 minutes.  Just 5 minutes.  Observe the excuses and grumblings that might float (or thud) in during the first few days.  Then observe what happens once your voice gets warmed up.  Check in here to let our book-writing community know how your 5 minutes/day went."},
{"title": "Pace Yourself:  An Exercise to Create Rhythm in Your Writing", "date": "Tuesday, October 7, 2008", "text": "Like changing seasons that move elegantly into each other, a good book has an almost invisible rhythm called pacing. Excellent pacing creates music a reader can resonate with. Pacing makes writing memorable.An Important Tool for Your WritingPacing is one of the most complex and exciting tools in book writing. It’s the speed of the story, the balance of anecdotes and concepts, the ebb and flow of the writing. Pacing determines your paragraph and sentence lengths, where you put in a line of dialogue, where you muse, where you wax lyrical over a setting. Two-Page SquintTo study how different writers deliver pacing to a reader—find a favorite book.  Open it, hold two pages up, squint at them, and see the balance of white space to text. Notice how conversation sections have more white space, description has less. So dialogue usually equals faster pace, and description (summary) equals slower pace. Studying the Pacing in Your Own WritingNow study the pacing in your own work.  For this week's exercise, find two favorite pages of your writing.  Read it aloud.  Freewrite for 10 minutes on these questions:What rhythm do you perceive? Is the pacing fast or slow? Where does it vary?"},
{"title": "It's Often What You Don't Say That Counts--A Weekly Writing Exercise about Negative Space", "date": "Tuesday, September 30, 2008", "text": "Painters know the concept of “negative space.” I learned it in art school. Negative space is everything that is not the main object in a still life or portrait.(If you can't imagine this, picture a painter getting ready to capture three yellow apples on a fuscia plate, with blue cloth as background. To the painter, the apples are the main objects. Plate and blue cloth are negative space.) Negative space is kind of like what's not said in your book.  Sometimes this speaks louder than your words.  The silences, the spaces between things.  The hum of what's unspoken brings more tension.  Especially true for memoir and fiction.  You have to have the main object and the negative space in constant conversation in a painting; although some experimental artists disagree, I’ve found one doesn’t work as well without the other. The apples in my painting above, without plate or cloth on the table, float in space, unanchored and possibly unbelievable. And without the plate's intense background, the apples' luminous golden color would not be as sharply defined and contrasted. Negative space serves to define and illuminate the main focus.So it is in book writing.Consider a chapter of your book-in-progress this week.  List everything that's not being said.  Is it creating absences of tension or omission?  Then ask yourself about the negative space in your life:  How does your book writing co-exist within your life? Is there a conversation going on?  What kind?  One of harmony and back and forth acceptance?  Or one of conflict, avoidance, irritation?Spend 10 minutes writing about negative space, both in your book and in the relationship between your life and your writing."},

{"title": "Red Smith's \"Opening a Vein\" versus Stephen King's \"Do It for Joy\"", "date": "Friday, August 15, 2008", "text": "When Walter Wellesley “Red” Smith said, “There’s nothing to writing.  All you do is sit down at a typewriter and open a vein,” he was talking about the vulnerability a writer must bring to the page. What does that mean?  Vulnerability for writers is how much they reveal, show, let the reader see about themselves.  Some writing teachers call it “showing up at the page.”  Many of us struggle with this vulnerability—how much should be shown, how much should be hidden, and how much “letting it all hang out” will cause the rest of our lives to fall apart.Last year, when I began writing another nonfiction book--this one about how to write a book, since I'd written and published twelve and was asked so often if I had one on my writing methods--I was also working on two others.  They were at various stages of drafting and almost-completion.  My novel was being shopped to publishers, who were giving me feedback and suggestions for changes.  The novel's sequel was in second draft, with all the sections written and pasted together; it did not yet resemble a book but it held promise.  The third, the nonfiction monolith, was in the proposal stage and I was beginning to draft chapters. One fine day, the novel got accepted by a small publisher with a good editing team.  I was thrilled, called my friends, cried with my family, and went out to celebrate.  When I got back to my office the next morning, the other two manuscripts looked at me reproachfully, as if to say, “We still need work.  Don’t forget you’re a working writer.” I write and teach full-time, so I have the luxury of many days alone in my writing studio with just my words to keep me company.  Finishing the last rewrites of this soon-to-be-published novel was like being in a dream state.  Some days, I found it hard to “wake up” and greet the normal world.  So I wanted a few minutes with normal activities, like watering the garden and cleaning the bathroom—believe it or not!The successful writer’s life is all about this balance between creative time and our normal life. A big myth:  writers (and other creative artists) must be financially distressed alcoholics who can’t keep a relationship going.  In fact, many writers in the past have been, but today’s book writer has other options.  It’s a matter of finding that edge where you can walk in some comfort, produce good work and get your book written, and still be a responsible member of your community.As Stephen King says in On Writing:  \"If you do it for joy, you can do it forever.\""},

There wasn’t a moment during Puccini’s music or story when my attention wandered. That’s exactly what good pacing does.  It doesn’t let the reader wander.Start tuning your writer’s ears by re-reading books you love.  Pick three in the genre of your book. ●  To study how the writers deliver information—where the pacing is fast, where it is slow—hold two pages up, squint at them, and see the balance of white space to text.  Conversation sections have more white space, description has less.  So conversation (dialogue) usually equals faster pace, and description (summary) equals slower pace. ●  Study the pacing at the end of a suspenseful or exciting chapter in one of these favorite books.  How short are the sentences?  Are the verbs particularly vivid? ●  How does the writer transition to the next chapter’s opening paragraph?  Is there a change in pace (usually, there is—so the reader can take a breath)? ●  Read two pages aloud.  What rhythm do you perceive?  Is it fast or slow?  Where does it vary?●  Look at the internal parts of the writing—what is being revealed by the author when the pacing is slow?  Is it an emotional moment where the author might want us to linger?  When the pacing is fast, is an event happening that’s very tense?  Is there a slower-paced section later in the chapter, where the meaning of the event is presented?●  Practice writing fast-paced scenes to fast-paced music, slow scenes to dreamy music.  How does your understanding of pace change as your writing changes?"},

Like you're in a forest of bits and pieces where nothing makes sense enough to be a book?A reader wrote me about this common dilemma:  \" I feel like a have a big mess!\" she said.  \"I like what I have written, but I don't know how to add to it at this point. I'm constantly thinking about writing. Constantly putting it off. My question is.....is it okay to keep writing this way? Is it okay to have bits and pieces? Do writers of memoirs (etc.) ever give a handful of pages to a 'writer' or editor to be written? Do/can these writers work together to create a wonderful story?\"Making Sense of the MessMany writers in my classes encounter this.  It's very normal.  The random part of you might love the bits and pieces you are producing, but the linear part wants it all to look like Something Good.  It's the time-honored struggle between the two creative sides of ourselves.  The trick is to acknowledge both as useful, and know when to switch.If you get that itchy feeling that there is too much mess, it's time for some structuring.  My favorite is the storyboard.  Used in film production, a storyboard is a giant blank cartoon--boxes waiting to be filled with steps of your story. So here's what you do:1.  Give a title to 10 of the bits and pieces you've written.  You can do more if you want--eventually, you'll do them all but this is a nonthreatening way to get your feet wet.2.  Draw a storyboard on a large piece of butcher paper.  Just create blank boxes, row after row, until you have 10 or more.3.  Look at your list of titles.  Imagine how they might logically or intuitively be placed on the storyboard.  What order could they go?4.  Write one title per box. This is a very basic storyboard.  What does it do?  It begins to calm that frustrated part of you that wants to see progress and order in your book writing journey.

{"title": "Exercise of the Week for Book Writers", "date": "Tuesday, June 24, 2008", "text": "Book writers (and all writers!) need to be able to hear both the random, illogical side of their creative selves, as well as the structuring, logical part.  Clues about how to improve our writing come from both.  If you have some difficulty listening to all parts of your creative self, ask the questions below.  If you find one of the questions harder, it might tell you that you are using an unfamiliar part of yourself (maybe your work and family life demands more of your logic than intuition, so the random side is underused). 1.    What do I think I should write about?2.   What am I most afraid of writing about?3.   What can’t I write about?4.   What won’t I write about?5.   What’s a sound or smell or taste I remember, but I don’t want to        write about?6.   What is the most logical thing to write about?  7.   How do I feel when I think of writing about that?Let yourself go into these questions in 10-minute segments of freewriting (no editing, crossing out, or even stopping writing), by setting a kitchen timer for 10 minutes and trying one question at a time.  Try to keep the pen moving the entire 10 minutes, even if it’s just to write “I don’t know, I don’t know” until something comes. When you feel you’ve exhausted this exercise, look over what you wrote.  Ask yourself which question brought up the most unexpected material, what you new insights on why you are writing this book.  And where you are not listening to yourself completely."},

{"title": "The Art of Persistence--Advice on Agents", "date": "Monday, June 16, 2008", "text": "A writing colleague just emailed me this wonderful site for information and advice on agents.  Check it out for lively discussions, then post your comments below on my blog. BookEnds, LLC — A Literary Agency: The Art of PersistenceWriting a book is a lot like taking a long trip down an unknown river. It's beautiful, exciting, and slightly dangerous--but entirely worth the effort. Especially if you have a good map.Maps are easy to create. I use the three questions below as a start. As you answer them, you'll begin to chart your particular book-writing journey.Why do I want to write this book?Why do I think a reader will want to read this book?What is this book’s purpose in the world? What greater good or mission could it fulfill?Why do these questions help you create your personal map for the book-writing process? Maps give confidence. They tell you where to go next if you get lost.Answering these questions tells you about your reasons for making the trip. That'll sustain you later--during editing, rewriting, and revisioning your manuscript so it can be successfully published.In my workshops, I've learned that if a writer considered why she wanted to write this particular book, and name the reasons on paper, she was much more likely to succeed.What do your answers mean?Here's what I've learned, working with many writers over many years:1. If you can only write easily, at length, about why youwould be satisfied writing this book, you’ve ignored thereader and the book itself—what it wants to say that’sbeyond your current knowledge. If the book-writingprocess only satisfies you, I promise it’ll be similar tojournaling. And that’s not very publishable, except if youare famous.2. If you know your exact reader but you don’t include yourown wishes and needs as you write the book, it willgravitate toward formula writing. I promise you it will behard to overcome the real work ahead because you maynot have the stamina to finish it or include the essential“inner story” which requires you to show up on the page.3. If you only write to expound on a strong convictionwithout taking your reader into consideration, the bookwill tend to sound preachy. The reader may not trust you,may feel you’re trying to “sell” an idea. You must bepresent on the page to deliver the sense that you’ve beenthrough this too, that you are invested in what you arewriting about. And if the writing satisfies only acommunity who are already convinced, it's the same aspromotional writing.When you first explore these questions, you may not have good answers to all of them. If you can’t answer the second and third question, your first assignment is to get out there and discover what’s in bookstores right now, what readers are reading, what topics are important. In your writer’s notebook (see below for more about this notebook), begin to jot down what means something to you that might also touch others.If you’re missing a good answer for the first question, do some soul-searching. What are you afraid of revealing on the page? What scares you about putting your heart into a book?Some writers, certainly, churn out book after book in a formula method, but usually they must have had one success—usually a big success—in order for that formula to work. For your first book, you need to invest yourself on several levels.“As I worked on these questions, I got stumped on #2. I realized that I’d never considered a reader at all. I had no idea why anyone would want to read my book, but when I began thinking about this, it was a revelation.”--Workshop attendee"},
{"title": "Why in the world am I writing this book?!!", "date": "Thursday, June 12, 2008", "text": "I once lived in Paris--the photo at right is the Eiffel Tower at night, all lit up for summer tourists. I learned the streets and shops and favorite places to get cheese and a baguette for picnics in the park.My most important guide was Plan de Paris, a small red book with detailed maps. With these maps, I could navigate the city with ease. A no-brainer, perhaps, for a journey through a foreign country. But how many of us use maps for the journey of writing a book?Maps are essential in book-writing. It's a process of mapping out a dream, a belief, a story, a theory. You're mapping it for yourself, first. Then for a reader.And the most important question you need to ask yourself, to create this map for your book?Why am I writing this?Sounds unimportant, perhaps. But in my experience teaching over 2000 writers how to plan, write, and develop their books, it's become one of the most important questions. It helps you create a map because it gives you clarity on your own reasons for writing the book.Books are long-term committments. Find out the reasons for the trip, before you begin to travel, and you'll have a great map to refer to if you get lost.So, why are you writing this book? Some initial questions might be:Is it for fun?For the family legacy?For money?For credentials for your job?To have a book to sell at your workshops or business?Because you have an amazing story to tell—one that won’t let you alone?And here are the most important questions to askNow you have begun to think about your deeper reasons for beginning this journey. It's time to home in on three aspects of the book-writing: self, reader, and the larger mission of your book.Take a minute to consider the questions below.Why do I want to write this book?Why do I think a reader will want to read this book?What is this book’s purpose (greater good or mission it could fulfill)?Read posts below for more information about these three questions and what they mean to your book."},

Perhaps your analytical, left brain balances your checkbook and navigates the road when you drive your car.Your more random right brain might enjoy a painting, daydream a garden design, plan the flavors of a meal, or replay a conversation with a friend, trying to sense the meaning behind it.   You’re listening to yourself, using all of yourself.And just as you do this naturally during your every day, you must also listen fully to yourself as you write your book.It’s not a new idea.But it’s really not used consciously by most book writers.I found that when I deliberately trained both sides of my creative self—the practical and the random, the editor and the creator—my book grew stronger and more able to touch a reader.Then a writer passed along this link to a very cool article about the way we switch back and forth.Let me know what you think!

{"title": "My story--thirteen books in thirty years", "date": "Thursday, May 8, 2008", "text": "I’ve written and published thirteen books in thirty years--novels, how-to books, memoirs, self-help books, and technical books. Each was a journey. There are so many benefits to being a published author:* seeing your name on books at your local bookstore* sharing your expertise with the world* having a reader say, \"This book changed my life!\"* telling your story* creative self-expressionEveryone always asks me, How did your first books get published?I'm a bit of an unusual case. Publishers came to me for my first three book contracts because I was an expert. I owned a natural foods gourmet cooking school. It was reviewed in USA Today. There weren't many such schools in the early eighties. The first publisher called me up. She was interested in a book about my healthy cooking methods. I wrote it with a lot of help. The book, Healthy Cooking, had all my favorite tips and ideas and great recipes. People loved it. And so did the cooking professionals. To my great delight, it won second place, best cookbook of the year, in the health and diet category of the IACP/Julia Child Awards, the largest awards for food publications. It was also the publisher's best seller that year out of 30 books.This success led to another book contract. . . and anotherAt the time, I didn’t ask myself why I wanted to write books. I was busy teaching and the books were a side project I was thrilled to do. Because the benefits were obvious: money and credentials. The books enhanced my career and helped pay my way for several years.Then I got hooked on writing books!I began writing other kinds of books (I co-authored Cholesterol Cures, published by Rodale Press, for example). Technical books were similar in format to food books—both were nonfiction, both expert-based. I became a good researcher and interviewer. I wrote about topics I learned about, from my unique research and perspective.A big life change--and change in my book-writingThen I had cancer, a business bankruptcy, and a divorce within a short period of time. Life changed!I used my writing as therapy but I also realized I wanted to share my outlook on life (how to handle such changes and trauma) with a reading audience.So I pitched a memoir/self-help book to a small publisher and got another book contract.    Switching genres--and a much harder book to writeThis book was called How to Master Change in Your Life and it was about my many experiences with changes in my life--plus interviews and stories from people about fear of change, how we can befriend change, and how inner guidance helps the entire process.  Click here to see more about this book:  How to Master Change in Your Life by Mary Carroll MooreIt was much harder to put together.  I had no experience writing in this new genre. When I asked myself why I was writing this book, it was because the experiences I’d lived through were life-changing. I knew others were going through such experiences. I wanted to help.I had all these stories, all these ideas. A writing friend suggested I try just writing these out, without worrying how to organize them. Even after ten years of book writing, with many published books behind me, I was still stymied by the book-writing process, but her suggestion freed me up from the more rigid outlines I’d used with the food and medical books. A memoir was less rigid, in essence, and I loved the flexibility.Memoirs also demand much more of you, personally. I had survived many hardships and learned much about the miracle of spiritual community. I wanted to write about this in a book about my life. This genre requires a writer to show up on the page and reveal beliefs, thoughts, weaknesses, failures, victories. I liked all my previously published books, but I hadn’t been as involved in them. I was the expert, I had good information to share, but I didn’t need to be vulnerable on the page.Doing my homework about the craft of book-writingI began to speak with other writers who’d published memoirs. What did it take? Most didn’t know. Almost all of them told me the same thing: you sit down in front of the computer, you wait, and you hope for the best.It sounded too hard. But the memoir idea persisted. Besides, I was hooked now. I liked seeing books on a bookstore shelf with my name on them. I wanted to write more books.So I wrote. I wrote small snippets. I didn’t worry too much about how they would go together. I photocopied sections of my journal where I’d recorded something that seemed to relate to my book idea.Two helpful books I discovered along the wayMy method was improved when I came across a writing book called A Writer’s Time, by former UCLA creative writing teacher Kenneth Atchity (W.W. Norton and Co., 1995). Atchity called my snippets “islands.” He validated my idea of keeping these islands separate during the exploration of a book idea. Then, after a certain number of words (or islands) was written, structuring could begin.My snippets were coming from both outer events I’d lived through and also the meaning of these events. I would come to call these the “outer story” of a book and the “inner story.” Soon I came across another writing book that confirmed my grass-roots idea: Vivian Gornick’s The Situation and the Story (New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2001). Gornick analyzed essays and talked about the important two sides to any good story, whether fiction or nonfiction—the situation or events (what I was calling the “outer story”) and the story underneath those events, their impact or effect or meaning (what I called the “inner story”).If a writer doesn’t make room for both the outer and the inner world of their book, the book will not touch a reader in a satisfying way.The story will not linger."},
{"title": "What are the inner and outer story of your book?", "date": "Wednesday, May 7, 2008", "text": "I'm a painter, too (one of my still life paintings is to your left), and I remember my favorite painting teacher once saying this: What's around the object in a painting is as important as the object itself.Artists call this area around the object \"negative space.\" Whenever I got stuck painting the object itself, I trained myself to look at the negative space and see if putting attention on that would bring the object into focus.   It often did.And this painting technique taught me a lot about how the inner story and the outer story work together as you're writing a book.Snippets (\"islands\") let the inner story evolve organicallyIn the post above, I talked about Kenneth Atchity's book, A Writer's Time, and Vivian Gornick's The Situation and the Story.  They gave me excellent ideas to improve my book-writing method.  I became skilled at pacing myself, writing in snippets (\"islands\"), and--most of all--restraining my need to organize until I had exhausted the random side of my writing self.This random side produces the inner story, the emotional juice, the creative leaps in literature.  Just like the negative space in a painting, it usually isn't the thing a writer focuses on.  Luckily, it comes out organically if you write in snippets.You'll probably be most familiar with your book's outer story.  It's the structure of your story (the framework, the building).The inner story is the life lived inside the events.  It's what we remember long after we finish a great book.  So, you can see how necessary it is!Learn to let the inner and outer story grow naturallyThe outer story grows from obvious outer specifics--like plot, setting, characters, your prime theories and techniques, the conflict your book presents.  Many writers are naturally strong in outer story.  If you tell a good story (orally) or you find plot easy, you're an \"outer story\" writer. People who mull over meaning, think about motive, consider psychological reasons for actions are often \"inner story\" writers.Both are good, both are necessary.  We all start from one of them as our strength.  It depends on our temperament, our introversion or extroversion to the world. It depends on our way of approaching our writing.So neither is more or less important. But they are essential to the reader--both of them.Each has a specific question I decided the outer story could best be answered by the question, What happened? The inner story was best answered by the question, What’s the point? The inner story is demonstrated (remember \"show, don't tell\"?) from the book's outer events or main topic.  To be believable, it must emerge naturally, organically.  Not be tacked on. I found it was a process.  As I wrote, the inner story began to peak through--almost unconsciously.  My best stories and books had this organic feel. I found that a writer must discover the inner meaning of her own book as she writes it, to produce a compelling inner story.   In a reader's mind, that makes a book worth lingering over.Inner story isn't always easy, but it is very rewardingAs I worked on learning about the inner and outer story, I began to see patterns.  Themes were emerging within the sequence of outer events. Patterns and echoes are delightful in literature. They bring out emotion. The inner story was showing itself in an organic way—and I realized it had emerged because I let myself create my book in snippets, accessing not just the linear writing self but the random one as well.Both Atchity and Gornick had taught me something very valuable and now I had discovered another level of each concept: Atchity’s idea of writing in snippets, letting myself be random, had allowed many new possibilities to emerge. It also had organically developed the subtler aspects of my book (Gornick’s \"story\" of The Situation and the Story).Without one, the other was much more difficult.I saw how the inner story—the meaning, transformation, or discovery—is born of the process of risk, of showing up on the page.What it meant for my writingMy last two published books, a novel and a self-help inspirational book, contain very developed inner and outer stories. Because I paid particular attention to developing both of these, the two books are my favorites of anything I've published.Not to be immodest, but I think it's wonderful that they still bring me delight when I read them—and that odd (but not uncommon) experience of wondering: Did I write this?And being delighted when I realize the answer is yes. You may already know this--but writing a book takes a lot of stamina.Because unlike writing a story, poem, essay, or article, completing a book-length manuscript is like a long-term relationship. You and your book will share head and heart space for months, even years.What books demandEver hear of \"platform\"? It's what today’s competitive publishing arena demands from book writers in any genre, especially new authors. Books are needing more upfront time--getting to know the book concept, planning and exploring that concept long before the first draft.Too bad! But it's the reality of publishing now.Few good books are written by someone just sitting down at the computer and letting it rip. (Unless they have already written ten books and know how to do it.)What I love most--and why I have taught book-writing for so many yearsMy favorite experience, often a year or two after they took the class, is when one of my former students appears with a copy of their published book in hand. “Here,” the writer says, handing the book to me with an intensely satisfied look on their face. “Because of your class, I finally finished this. And it was just published.”This can be your dream come true, too. But I've learned not everyone can do it. It takes work, belief, stamina to realize any dream, and especially it's true if you're trying to manifest a book.Here's what to ask yourself, a kind of self-test to see if you have the stamina to write (and publish) a book:1. Are you willing to spend actual time--regular time--on yourwriting?2. Do you feel passionate about your topic?3. Are you willing to explore, not know, \"dwell in the unformed\"as a writing friend calls it?4. How are you about receiving feedback? After the initialohmygod, do you rally and renew your vision?5. How are you at negotiating with friends, family, job--andyourself--for the privacy and dream time you need to write abook?6. Do you have support for your journey?I hope this blog will provide a good map on your journey through the foreign territory of planning, writing, and developing your book. I hope the tips, tools, encouragement, and practical advice will give you the momentum and confidence you must have to finish your journey.In the meantime, check out the exercise on the side of this page. Let me know how you like it."}
