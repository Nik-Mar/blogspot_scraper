{"title": "December bargains ", "date": "Thursday 4 January 2024", "text": "Carlisle cathedralI've already mentioned the bargains I had from Marks and Spencer, which are for birthday presents this year.  I think apart from those, I've just had food bargains in the latter part of the month... some truckles of cheese from M and S which were £1.12 instead of either £3.75 or £4.75, and half price mince pies, chocolates and a Christmas pudding. I live in hope that at some point this year I'll be well enough to eat the pudding... it's something to aim for.In the local Co-op we bought half price Malteser reindeers, which were directly next to full price Malteser bunnies... exactly the same chocolate,  just a different shape!We did have a free day out earlier in the month, as our Edinburgh trip didn't go to plan. Our train was cancelled not far away from Edinburgh due to a broken down train, and so it headed back to Manchester. We were given the option of trying to get onto a 3 carriage already busy train that stopped briefly at Carstairs where we had pulled in. The scenes were horrendous as people from our packed, 5 carriage train tried to fit onto it. We opted not to try, and instead headed back,  getting off at Carlisle for a few laughter packed hours. I claimed our train fares back, and they more than covered what we'd spent there, and on a couple of drinks when we got back to our hometown. It wasn't the day that we'd all planned and were looking forward to, but we enjoyed the day and it cost us nothing."},
{"title": "The sandwich", "date": "Wednesday 3 January 2024", "text": "2023 was a year of massive change. I started the year living in a quiet household of 2, alone quite a lot of the time, and mostly able to please myself as to what I did when. I ended the year living in a busy, noisy household of 5, rarely alone,  and no longer able to please myself as to what I do when.It was also the year that I finally admitted that I have an eating disorder. I sought help, was diagnosed, and yet still feel like a fraud.I have no idea what 2024 will bring, but I do know that I need to find some time for me again because I've lost myself quite a lot. Chunks of me are given to everyone, and to the ED, which leaves little to nothing.I am truly the filling in the sandwich,and have been for a number of years, but I'm now caring for and supporting 3 generations, not 2.Knowing that I need to find the time is one thing, figuring out how to achieve it is a whole other ball game."},

The hallway has had garlands, wreath and tree removed, and the living room mantelpiece is back to normal...The tree is still in place as I have to fit removals around the little one napping or being in bed at night.

{"title": "Sales", "date": "Thursday 28 December 2023", "text": "Nothing to do with sales, just the Bailey's cheesecake my daughter made. Many years ago, when my dad was still alive ( it will be 29 years in February since he died), going to the sales after Christmas was a big event for us. Mum and dad, me and a sister would hit the sales, leaving our husbands and children at home, then dad would take us to our favourite Italian for lunch. My dad loved shopping and loved a bargain even more. In those days, sales really were sales, and we would be laden down with bags. They were happy times, much looked forward to, but when he died, the sparkle of those days was gone and couldn't be recreated.I haven't been to the sales for years, but went yesterday. My mum had given me £20 for Christmas and I bought a black cord pinafore from New Look, reduced from £26.99 to £10, and a jumper from Primark, reduced from £18 to £10. My husband got a jumper in Primark reduced to £7, and we bought 3 birthday presents in M and S, along with a pair of leather shoes for my daughter. The original price for those 4 items totalled £124 but I paid £42.50.I only went into M and S for a loaf, and was surprised by how good the sale prices were. I only have 2 adult birthdays and the little one left to buy for in 2024 and will keep an eye out for more bargains.Today I bought half price wrapping paper for the little one's gifts for next Christmas,  and a half price roll of plain brown paper to use for birthdays throughout the year. I'll wrap the things I bought yesterday and put them into a storage box for the next 7, 11, and 12 months!"},

{"title": "Ticking", "date": "Sunday 17 December 2023", "text": "I've had a list of things to do for what feels like forever,  and as I rarely seem to have time to myself these days it's been difficult to get things ticked off.Today has been a good day for ticking.The first thing was to finally try on the pyjamas my daughter bought for me and the nightie I bought for myself weeks ago which have been hanging there waiting to be tried. It seems ridiculous that I haven't had the time, inclination or mental ability to try 3 items on, but that's how things are nowadays.Bottoms, top and nightie all fit, and have now been washed, have been out on the line for a blow, and are finishing off on the radiators. Next on the list was to finish clearing 9A ready for giving it up at the end of the month. Things worsened with our plot neighbour, which confirmed that we did the right thing by deciding many months ago to give it up due to his earlier behaviour.Today we dug out the last of the bulbs, a dogwood and a clematis, moved the last of the piles of weeds, and cleared bits of plastic, roofing felt etc that had blown onto the plot. It's in a decent state for whoever takes it on. Two of the three planting areas are weed free, the other just has surface weeds which can be easily hoed off. I pruned the raspberry canes, and there's a bed full of strawberry plants. When we took it on the council had to provide a skip solely for our use as it contained so much rubbish.A few weeks ago we removed our shed, paving, water butts, and the bricks and wood that edged all of our paths and growing spaces. We replaced all the wood a few years ago, which wasnt cheap. It's been painted regularly and is still like new, so it will go around the beds on the other plot. If we'd been giving up allotmenteering altogether, we'd have left everything, but we're keeping our other plot, where everything will be used as we have a big revamp planned.I feel relieved that we've finished everything and don't have to think about it any further.These 3 photographs were taken in January 2016 when we took it on...By July 2016 it was a tidy, productive plot...This is how it looked today...Next on the list today was to plant all the bulbs that I'd dug out of 9A; hyacinths, crocuses, daffodils and snake's head fritillaries. I've put them all into the long bed in the front garden which my husband had just hoed and weeded. I also planted a few primroses from the plot, and some violas and a heuchera, which I'd rescued from the posh garden centre a few weeks ago. My husband tidied the other two beds that border the front garden, so it all looks good again.I feel better for ticking a few things off, and working outside always helps my mental health.This week I have an appointment at the eye clinic, my ED appointment, 4 days of childcare, and the car is being serviced and MOTd. Fingers crossed it doesn't need any repairs and it passes. It's 13 years old now, so it's always a worry.Have a good week everyone."},
{"title": "M is for Memories", "date": "Friday 15 December 2023", "text": "I put a small Christmas tree up in our bedroom yesterday.Memories of Christmases past came flooding back; of childhood Christmases in all the different houses I lived in, of Christmases with my girls, and the excitement I felt each Christmas Eve, just like when I was a child, of Christmases missing people, and of my grandchild's first Christmas last year.Some happy, some not. Just life really."},

Christmas decor 2023", "date": "Saturday 9 December 2023", "text": "Most of the Christmas decoration is done, in matching colours, which is just how we like it.The tree skirt is new this year, half price from the local posh garden centre. I'd looked at them  when they were £19.99 which was beyond my flinch point. When I returned the following week they were £9.99 so I bought one.A stocking, bought by mummy, to match the bear bauble I bought last year. Hung well out of reach of little fingersA 'new' wire tree, 50p from a charity shopThe dining table is now sited in the hallway. The tree that's on it is a fibre optic one, bought for me by my dad over 30 years ago. The little one loves the colour changing lights.The living room doesn't look like it usually does, because there's now a fireguard and toy boxes in there and there's a barrier around the TV unit, because the little one likes the sound bar too much. So far, they've been gentle with the tree, and have 2 or 3 baubles that they really like, and will spin around whilst kneeling alongside.I decorated the banisters and mirror in the hall yesterday. I spent about 20 minutes doing it, and it shows, so I still need to have a play about with that. It's so dull and wet that it's going to have to wait as I need some more greenery from the garden.Enthusiasm for Christmas is still lacking, but I'm trying."},

This year there won't be any of the precious things on the tree  because they're either glass or fragile or both, and as my grandchild lives here and is even more precious, those things will be staying in their boxes, so my decor will be even more ripe for the hatred.Pathetic."},

I was eventually diagnosed with ME/CFS, though I'm sure two bouts of Covid have also played their part, along with the anorexia. I can't remember what it's like to feel really well, or not to pay the price for a day of feeling better and 'doing too much'. I'm currently on a train to Edinburgh, as we're having a day out with my husband's brothers and sisters in law. I will doubtless pay the price for it, but if I don't try to do things it's an existence rather than a life, so I keep on trying."},

I always fill them with Celebrations chocolates, and this year the tub cost £4.Some left over after filling both calendars.I looked to see if Celebrations calendars are available... they are, at £5 each.

{"title": "R is for Ribs", "date": "Thursday 23 November 2023", "text": "I damaged my ribs on Saturday. I think they're either bruised or cracked, but not broken.We'd brought some bags of bindweed home from the allotment to go into our brown bin to be collected by the council. When I opened the lid it was empty except for two oat milk cartons that had been thrown in by mistake.Stupidly, I leant in to get them and damaged my ribs on the narrow ridge of hard plastic around the bin as most of my weight was on it. I forget that I now have visible ribs and not the inches of padding I once had. Unfortunately it's at the same side as the ribs I popped a couple of years ago, and which often feel ' twisted'.Since Saturday it hurts to take a deep breath, and I wince, and gasp involuntarily, if I move in certain ways. Sleeping is difficult, as is sneezing, coughing or laughing.I looked up bruised and cracked ribs on the NHS website and the advice is the same for both. It does say ' no heavy lifting' , but that's impossible whilst looking after a toddler.Who knows how long they'll take to heal."},
{"title": "D is for Degree", "date": "Wednesday 22 November 2023", "text": "I returned to education aged 40, having turned my back on it at 16 after taking my O levels. I went to the local college to take an Access course, and then to university to undertake teacher training, studying Primary Education with English. I loved college, but university was a grave disappointment, apart from my English specialism; the specialism leader was the one shining light and was full of encouragement. My first piece of work for him was graded 85, and he told me it was almost of publishing standard...not bad for the person who only got a C in her English Literature O level.The course was badly run and some of the tutors were absolutely useless. The day before I was hospitalised with a suspected heart attack in the November of my final year, I handed to our tutor group rep 3 sides of A4 of complaints about the course and its running, as things had deteriorated yet again. I never did find out if anything was done as I ended up having to take a year off, diagnosed with a debilitating heart condition.When I returned, things were no better. I'd received my timetable, but on my first day back, having driven 25 miles to get there, I found that the day's classes had been cancelled the previous week but nobody had bothered to let me know. I beat a quick path to the course leader's door, and let her know my thoughts. I walked out more than once after that, yet still achieved a first for every piece of work submitted in my final year, and a first overall, averaging 75 over the 3 years. My first year's work won me a scholarship for academic excellence which gave me a financial reward each year. I never told anyone at uni about it because it would have been seen as bragging. I've always found it strange that people are celebrated for sporting prowess or musical ability but academic ability is sneered at as being a 'swot'. My younger daughter referred to it as my ' clever money', which always made me smile.I graduated in 2010 knowing nobody, because my friends had graduated the year before. The degree certificate is somewhere in the attic, and I have one photo of me in cap and gown, stored digitally who knows where. I also have tens of thousands of pounds of student debt that will never be paid back, good memories of DS who was my amazing English tutor, and the majority of my assignments still in a box, so I can read them and remember what I was once capable of."},
{"title": "C is for Christmas  ", "date": "Tuesday 21 November 2023", "text": "Following on from yesterday's 'B is for Baubles' post, I thought I'd write about Christmas. Two posts in 2 days, and in alphabetical order... I'm doing better than I anticipated.Our Christmases aren't like most people's. We haven't exchanged gifts for years, although I will make a hamper for my Mum with home baked things and I have bought gifts for our little one (one toy and some clothes).We don't all gather together. We all do what we want to, and nobody is offended by others' choices. There's no pressure for it all to be 'perfect', which suits us all really well, and makes for a much happier time. We gather when it suits us, not when society thinks we should.I've put up a ' Thoughts on Christmas' page from an old blog. You can find it underneath the header photo at the top of the blog. The ' Top Tips' posts are from 2011 but I still feel the same about Christmas 12 years later, particularly the 'Great Expectations'."},

We were thrilled to find a shop selling items that represent her little family.I have colour co-ordinated Christmas decorations, because, quite honestly, I would find it jarring if I didn't. Contrary to popular belief, colour co-ordination doesn't mean that I'm constantly changing decorations and throwing stuff away, or that there is no sentimental value to anything I hang. My current black and gold scheme is courtesy of my Mum's cast offs, but my tree also has things on it that I hung on a tree as a small child in the early 70s, others that hung on a tree for our first married Christmas in 1984, others that commemorate the deaths of parents, one that my elder daughter made for her little sister to hang on the tree the Christmas she found out she was expecting our little one, and also baubles from their childhood days. They just happen to co-ordinate with the black, gold and neutral baubles that I have.I hope some enthusiasm to decorate the house appears very soon."},

I display all the same behaviours as someone who suffers from typical anorexia ( and a more obscure one that most don't do but I have found medical research papers about it), but my weight is still within 'normal' limits. I didn't even know there was such a thing, and kept telling myself there was nothing wrong with me because I'm not emaciated and I'm almost 59 years old, not a teenager. There's lots of information about atypical anorexia online if anyone wants to know more about it.In case you havent seen it and it's relevant to you... this was buried due to the shenanigans in Downing Street yesterday..."},

The other bedroom just needed clearing, some paint touching up and the carpet cleaning. A new boiler has been fitted and the stairs will be carpeted soon. More stuff than I care to think about has been decluttered, and most of it has been donated... furniture, clothes, shoes, books, fabric, yarn, ornaments, vases, bedding, curtains, cushions, and my collections of Hornsea and Meakin. I hope people enjoy finding treasures, and the charities benefit. Some things have gone to the tip, but not many in comparison to what has been donated.It's been an expensive, exhausting and stressful couple of months, as we've tried to fit things around work and providing childcare. I lost precious time through having vertigo, but we're done now.There were many decisions to be made about what was to go and what was to be kept... always difficult for a pair of indecisive Pisceans,  and the house has been in a permanent state of disarray as things were moved downstairs and out of the house, furniture was cleared out or moved between rooms, and work took place.I had some regrets about starting the bathroom on top of everything else,  but it was the right decision and we're pleased with it. Even the toilet has turned out well considering I bought the paper online and the colour wasn't as expected.Being the filling in a sandwich of supporting an elderly parent, aswell as my younger daughter and her family is far from easy. It wouldn't be easy for a healthy person. Add in an eating disorder, ME/CFS and a heart that doesn't always behave as it should, and it becomes even more difficult.Our last trip away was very much needed, as will be the next one, whenever that comes... I'm always on the lookout, childcare permitting.Some people live such wonderful lives that they don't need to get away from the everyday now and again. I'm not one of them, as I can't turn my back on people who need my help and support a lot of the time, even when I'm feeling sub-par myself. However, I occasionally need peace and quiet, wide open skies, and most importantly, nobody wanting a piece of me, so that I can feel physically and mentally ready to cope with the next round. I think that's a fairly normal way to be, and it helps to prevent the ED spiralling.Last night our little one went to bed in the bedroom that was once their mummy's, and mummy and daddy went to bed in our old room. We climbed the stairs to our lovely attic room.Not forever, but for now, so that one day they too will be able to own their own home."},
{"title": "Trashed", "date": "Wednesday 25 October 2023", "text": "Our half plot at the allotment has been trashed. Not by young vandals who broke in, but by the site Secretary and 2 other plot holders.We are giving the half plot up but are still working on it so that it's in a good state to hand over to a new tenant. We've cleared one rotational third and covered it, cleared another third, we're in the process of clearing the final one, and I've cut back the Autumn raspberries. The area referred to as ' the woodland' that was planted with hundreds of spring bulbs, had recently been weeded and painstakingly dug over by me, on my hands and knees, using a trowel so that I could remove the bulbs to bring home and plant in the front garden.The site Secretary called at my home yesterday to drop a letter off about insurance and asked if I'd read the email he sent. I hadn't, so he said he'd put the wood from my plot neighbour's recently demolished shed on the covered part of our plot, that it would be moved in time for the site bonfire, and if I wanted it moving before that he would do so. Fool that I am I thought it had been neatly stacked.I went to look today. The wood has been dumped haphazardly, just thrown there. It is full of nails, and has been thrown on top of brand new plastic sheeting. That's bad enough, but my recently worked woodland area has been trashed... trampled all over, butler sinks full of bulbs emptied, upturned and dumped in the middle of the area, wood dumped on top of plants and shrubs I intended to bring home for the garden.I saw our plot neighbour, and voiced my anger and disgust at what he and the others have done whilst demolishing part of his shed and rebuilding what is left. It clearly fell on deaf ears, as when we returned this evening so my husband could see it, the area is in an even worse state than it was this morning. He's also emptied our water butt and fitted a downspout into it. We removed it and placed the butt onto our large plot. Our plot sign which I painted with our names and plot number was dumped on the ground, roofing felt is all over the plot and the ground is even more churned up than it was this morning.We are furious, and sickened that they think they have carte blanche to do what they want, just because we're giving that plot up at the end of the year.We were working hard to leave the plot in a good state, and we had made a lot of progress. It now looks like it's been trashed.Emails have been sent to the secretary this morning and this evening. No reply has been received yet. I have made 'Keep off' notices and will put them in the woodland area tomorrow. If this continues I will have to contact the council.Needless to say, we will not be attending the bonfire.

There is only one way to get a ladder into there, so you need to be a contortionist doing anything at height. The ceiling height is over 10 feet, which is why the room feels like a lift shaft.The change of plan is that we're now not having tiles. There isn't time to do them, so I've bought some wallpaper that was reduced to £6 per roll.

I also needed the loo, and got stuck there for ages, with cold sweats, loud whooshing in my ears, blackness descending and feeling I was going to vomit. It was the worst I have felt in a long time.At that point, I thought I should see my GP. I rang at 8am, explained the problem, and was given an appointment for 10.30am. After a thorough check , he says I have BPPV. He asked why I hadn't sought medical help sooner, and I explained that I thought it was a virus, or the ME/CFS, or the ED, all of which can cause me to feel as I do. It's a bit like stick a pin in and guess which thing is causing the problems on any given day... I'm just used to feeling ill.It's ongoing, though much better than it was, and I'm doing the prescribed manoeuvres. I'm not driving; it happens when I'm in bed, or getting out of bed, but I'd rather be safe, and it's left me feeling exhausted. There's no way I can paint the ceiling and walls in the toilet, the only new photos on my phone are of the little one, and they're off limits, so there's nothing to write about at the moment."},

We may have beading in the garage, but if not have priced up what we need.Details of the 2021 revamp can be found here, when I went for dark decor...One of these days I will get the bathroom of my dreams, but in the meantime cheap and cheerful revamps have to do...The tiles had 4 layers of paint scraped off them to return them to how they were when we bought the house in 2011The charity shopped wallpaper was great quality, but not worth the retail price of £64 per roll.One new plantpot, and one moved from another roomOur new to us cupboard was bought from the British Heart Foundation.We'd been looking for ages unsuccessfully, and I'd found a white one in Argos that would do. We went out on Sunday and found this, which is perfect. I much prefer secondhand.It provides lots of storage spaceA big change from the old black and white. The room is so light and bright now that my husband keeps thinking the light has been left on.These are the things I've bought recently...Earlier this year I bought soap dispenser, toothbrush holder, beaker, a few plantpots, wall mirror, flexible mirror, and 2 hand towels. The towels were bought at Marks and Spencer with 20% off, all other items except the flexible mirror were red stickered at TK Maxx. The mirrors were the best bargains at £7 instead of £29.99 for the wall, and £1 at the carboot for the small."},

It took ages, but I did a bit at a time, and finished it this afternoon. I couldn't remember when the laminate was laid, but I found a picture on an old blog...It was laid in September 2011 to replace some secondhand flooring we'd laid the month before and which was ruined soon after because the shower leaked.The wallpaper is being hung tomorrow, and we'll buy the beading for around the edge of the laminate and fit that.Not needing to buy flooring, and opting not to replace the light fitting, means there is money to buy a radiator cover and a tall narrow cabinet, as the cupboards that were in the shower room in 2011 are now in the attic room, having originally been bought when I started uni in 2006."},

Dulux Natural HessianThe wall that is black on this photograph is the one that's been strippedThe shower room revamp is ongoing and it seems to be taking forever. I always find small rooms more difficult as they're harder to work in, and as it's the only bathing facility we have, it has to remain usable which means constant clearing up.I don't rate Dulux paint very highly as it's taken 3 coats of it to cover the bathroom walls and ceiling.  It was okay when I used it in the bedroom, but I painted that over newly hung lining paper. This has gone over the top of white emulsion, and coverage is poor to say the least. Existing tiles on the left, new one on the rightThe scraped tiles have come up really well, and we've found some that are almost identical, but slightly smaller, so we're going to use them in the toilet as I prefer to have the two rooms tied together decor wise, even though they're  separate. I'm trying to reuse as much as I possibly can to keep costs as low as possible, so although I'd love a new light fitting for the shower room, there's nothing wrong with the old one so it's staying. I also think the laminate flooring underneath the black and white tiles is salvageable. If so it will be cleaned up and some new beading fitted around the edges.Once it's finished I have to start the lift shaft  (the toilet room that has a tiny footprint but very high walls). We're working to a deadline and everything has to be finished by the end of next month.I've heard nothing about my ED treatment so life goes on as usual."},

I bought both, having settled on a green and neutral colour scheme for the shower room.When we got home I looked up the make and pattern number and was stunned to find that it originally retailed at £64 per roll!

I shop in there regularly for basics. My husband highly rates their 50p per tin baked beans, preferring them to his usual Branston, and the little one has their reduced sugar and salt version. Other items, such as a 500g block of English butter, are cheaper than in the supermarkets.They had red shelf labelled lots of products, mainly to one tenth of the usual price, probably to make space for Halloween and Christmas ranges. There wasn't much left, but I was particularly happy with the baking cases, which I've looked at numerous times but couldn't justify them at full price.Apart from these things, I've had a pair of M&S jeans, and a pair of River Island jeans, both in immaculate condition, for £1 per pair from the Salvation Army charity shop sale rail, and a long, hooded bodywarmer for £20 rather than £36.99 from New Look.I'd been looking at the same style thing in Primark for weeks, but it was around the £27 mark. I have no idea why a new range item was reduced so much in store, but was very happy to find it. I've had my money's worth from the jeans already, and have worn the bodywarmer almost every day since I bought it as I feel the cold a lot."},

{"title": "This is why...", "date": "Saturday 16 September 2023", "text": "... I don't put names, faces and details on the blog.Some time ago someone who uses a nom de plume posted something identifying about one of their offspring on their blog. I wondered how much they'd revealed by doing so. Within no time at all I hadfound the social media of their offspring, their offspring's partner, the writer's spouse, some of their grandchildren and I had seen photographs of them.I found one of their offspring's place of work, position within the company,  and employment history. If I'd spent some money I could have obtained their home addresses. It's not the first time this has happened; some bloggers and Instagram users have revealed so much that I have found their home addresses, business names and the financial accounts they've submitted to Companies House.Other people have chosen to put photographs of their children or grandchildren on their blogs and Instagram, with enough information that I easily found where they live and go to school. Some of them have posted photographs of those children half naked and in underwear or swimwear. Some of the adults doing this are, or have been, in positions with responsibility for safeguarding children in their professional lives. These children are too young to understand or give consent to information about them, and photographs of them, being available to anyone and everyone online.All of the information I've mentioned was easy to find. Yes, I used to be a fraud investigator in a former life, but I no longer have access to those systems and solely used what's freely available on the Internet. The posters made it easy with what they'd revealed.I have no ulterior motive for doing this, I was just curious about what could be easily found by those who do have ulterior motives. I wonder if people who put identifying information online, particularly about children, realise what they're doing.Children are taught about Internet safety, and yet the very people who should protect them, are putting them at risk for likes, comments, and to make money from ads and affiliate links."},

This room was covered in woodchip wallpaper which was painted yellow and it had a gold carpet. I don't have any  photos of it looking like that. We did a quick makeover so that my daughter could have her friends to stay after their prom.By 2014  it had become a dumping ground, so I renovated using what I had, other than a £1 spend on a circular mirror...The very dated wardrobes which lead to 'Narnia'2016 brought a debilitating mystery illness that took 6 years, umpteen medical procedures, MRI scans, steroids and other meds, to find out what was wrong with me. The room became a dump again, and this was it in 2017...Yet again I used the ' how do you eat an elephant?' method, sometimes just doing 15 minutes tidying a day, because that's all I was capable of. Eventually it was done...My crafting area was tucked away behind a curtain. The doorway in the wall the desk faces has been reinstatedI used what I had, and sewed, knitted and painted things for the room.Yet again it didn't last, as I became more and more ill, and then we stored all the baby's outgrown clothes and equipment, amongst other things. By last month the room looked like this ( it was worse than this and the floor was covered, but I dont have photos)...Now, it looks like this...I dug out my painting of Polruan while I was up in the attic yesterday. It was bought from a little second hand place in Liskeard years ago and is dated 1976.  I also put a fake plant on the shelf under my bedside table.On top are my Eidelweiss music box which was a gift from a trip to Vienna,  and a carved bird bought last year for £1 in a charity shop. Somehow, the room feels bigger than it did in any of the other incarnations despite it now having a king-sized bed in it.We have donated 3 carloads of 'stuff', along with a desk, filing cabinet and sofa bed, we've taken a couple of carloads to the tip, and there's still a bit more to go. I fully intended to renovate without spending any money, but it hasn't turned out that way. I've been noting down everything we've bought for the room and it's currently...We still need to get the new door and fit that, so it's going to come in around £210, but I think the transformation is worth the money.The areas of the room near the door and window can be seen on the previous post."},

There are still a couple of things to be completed/ moved, but we're in touching distance now.I bought the curtains and wallpaper, but everything else in these photographs has been reused from other rooms, or taken from storage.The Dorma curtains have been made with the pattern upside down ( it looks wrong to me, and the matching curtains at the window have the pattern what looks to be the 'right' way up). Changing the heading tape so that they're the right way up is one of the jobs on my list.The Lloyd Loom laundry basket was originally green, then red, now it's white... the original green would have been perfect.These four photographs are of the corner as you come into the room via the reinstated doorway. At some point in the house's history the attic was 2 separate rooms. The curtains cover the old 60s/70s sliding wardrobe doors, one of which leads to the storage space in the eaves, and at the end of the house. It's always referred to as ' Narnia' as we access it through the wardrobe.I'm finally happy with the area near the windowI'm not happy with the lamp but it's a touch base one so I can't paint it, and my taller lamps don't fit due to the slope of the ceiling. The shades don't look right, so I need to rummage through the small quantity of fabric I kept to find something better. My husband added a shelf to the bottom of the table this week, using an offcut of MDF from the garage.I'm hoping to get a few things done in the room this afternoon once I drop the baby off, then I can try to photograph the main body of the room and do some comparisons with previous incarnations, and the dumping ground it was last month."},

I popped into the local hospice charity shop and found 2 boxes of Lego for £10 each. A flurry of WhatsApp messages later, I bought them and they were handed over yesterday.I want neutral tiles in the shower room, and remembered that under the black paint, grey paint and 2 layers of white paint that have been applied over the years, the tiles are neutral. Scraping began, and with a glass scraper (£2.20 in Wilko yesterday) the paint is coming off like a dream. It's messy, but far less messy than knocking them off and re-tiling, and so much cheaper, which leaves money to be used on other things for the room."},
{"title": "More changes", "date": "Thursday 31 August 2023", "text": "Having to change plans due to the voile curtains not fitting the wardrobes has meant I've had to re-do the bedding box and 2 chairs. I'm entirely responsible as I should have checked the curtains before doing anything else. It's a bit of Rob Beckett's idiot tax, but in time, not money.I stripped the old tablecloth off the bedding box and used a remnant of green velvet; one of the few that I kept when I decluttered. I've changed the curtains ... it was necessary after the voile debacle. I'm going to use the green ones I had hanging here as linings. The pink cushion is an old one from our bed, and I made the one with the embroidery back in 2012.I used an old curtain on the chairs. I was gutted that I had to remove the blue curtain, but it just didn't go with what I've used instead of the voile, or with the old rug that I dragged out from the depths of the attic ( passed on by my mum years ago, and previously used in my living room)  so it had to be changed. At least there was only one of these chairs to do; the other was given away as there was no space for it. The 'hall chair' had also been covered in the tablecloth. This chair came from a charity shop back in 2013. I stripped the treacle like varnish to reveal beautiful oak. It's had a number of different seat covers over the last 10 years. My mum has its twin in her hallway but it's painted white with a Laura Ashley seat covering.There's still some tidying to do, and a few things to move round, then we're done up there.It's a busy time:New wallpaper and a freshen up of the paint in the kitchen...✔️A complete overhaul of the attic room with a huge amount of decluttering ✔️Decorate the back bedroom ✔️We have some furniture to dispose of from the front bedroom, and I'll probably give the walls a fresh coat of white paint too.I'm still going through drawers and wardrobes, and trying to be ruthless with clothes.I've found a cheaper solution to updating the shower room and toilet, and started that this afternoon. I need to find and order a stair carpet.There is so much going on, so many balls are being juggled, there are not enough hours in the day, and I'm not getting enough sleep... that could be the ME/CFS, the ED, the vitamin deficiencies and/ or the menopause... a perfect storm indeed.Just keep swimming, just keep swimming... and when exhausted, float to survive."},

The picture is one that I'd bought months ago for the bathroom, which is now on the back burner. The white emulsion for the walls and ceiling, and the wood paint for picture rails, skirting, door frame and radiator cover were left over from doing the attic room. The lampshades are the existing ones as mentioned on the previous post; I trimmed them with some ribbon from the stash.Walking the walk is sometimes difficult, particularly when it means huge upheaval, but that's life, and when there's not much choice you just have to get on with it."},

I've had to spend to solve some problems, which is annoying, but I didn't have much choice. I've also had to buy new light fittings as the ones up there had multiple bulbs of a type which used a lot of electricity and generated a lot of heat...so much for doing the room without spending money.I'll take some photos soon, when we get some decent light. We've now almost finished another room, and I've just sorted the lightshades in there.They've hung in the room for years and were originally grey and had 3 tiers. When I last revamped them I removed 2 tiers and covered them in a remnant of silk. Today I removed that, sanded the glue from the edges and painted them black with some watered down emulsion.We have spent very little time at the allotments over the last few years, and it shows. First there was family ill health, then covid, then the baby, and more illness. The weather has played a big part, too. Too much heat, and then too much rain at the wrong parts of the growing season.We've decided to give up our original plot at the end of the year, and just keep the other. We visited one evening this week; I strimmed everywhere and picked produce and my husband dug potatoes and finally planted the leeks... I think they're going to need a miracle as they're so late going in! The first of the Autumn raspberries and the blackberries were both for the baby. It's said that rhubarb shouldn't be picked after July, but I do it every year. I have at least 10 crowns, so I alternate. The one this came from is showing no signs of slowing down for the season, so I picked from it. It's now in the freezer. The courgettes will become soup and be frozen and the tomatoes will be roasted and frozen. Maybe I'll be able to eat some of it in a few months' time, but not now.Trigger warning... ED stuff belowI had my appointment for a health check at the ED clinic this week. It was third time lucky and this one wasn't cancelled. My bloods hadn't been done for 3 months, so they were needed, my BP was checked ( it's low at the moment according to my monitor) and was still on the low side despite a brisk 20 minute walk,from where we parked across town, to the clinic. I was weighed. You'd think that wouldn't be a problem for a woman who gets weighed numerous times a day, but it is, because they weren't my scales, and I wasn't weighed under my conditions. I was up at 5am on the day, and weighed multiple times, both naked and clothed. I closed my eyes on their scales and requested not to hear the result. I rarely eat what people would recognise as meals, on a plate, with a knife and fork. I ate 2 in May. The first was a small amount of pasta with salmon on our wedding anniversary at what used to be our favourite restaurant, where we went regularly. I really tried because it was our anniversary, but it was a disaster. I had a couple of Quorn meatballs and salad leaves for the other meal. I ate 1 meal in June ( some ham and salad leaves),  none in July, and none so far this month, because I just can't face it. The number of things I will eat continues to reduce, and the last cooked, hot food I ate was that pasta in May.This is dinner most nights, served in a 6\" cereal bowl...A Granny Smith apple, always chopped into a particular, set number of pieces, 2 dessert spoons of fat free Greek style yoghurt, and a sprinkle of fruit and nut muesli. I eat this for a lot of my 'meals', whether breakfast, lunch or dinner. Today it was lunch, and I think it will be dinner too.Treatment can't come soon enough."},

I've added that job to tomorrow's list, to be tackled once I've gone through the last of my sewing stuff to decide what to keep and what to dispose of. Also on the list is sorting the curtains to cover the hideous built in wardrobes. I did find a curtain track in Wilko today for £2, so that was a win. It's by Swish, 225cm long, an old fashioned curtain track which is just what I needed. Their own brand one was £8 for 2m."},
{"title": "Winning", "date": "Sunday 6 August 2023", "text": "We're winning in the loft room. The old  cupboards that have been painted numerous times over the years have gone from black to white and are in position. I've put food in them, though I don't keep as much in stock as I used to. They're in the space where the freezer used to be. We've put a curtain rail up, ready for the vintage curtains that I've had for years and never used.We needed to stop for a rest once we'd got the freezer down the stairs, something that involved unblocking an old doorway. I was younger and much stronger when we took it up there, and I just couldn't manage to manoeuvre it through the other doorway to get it out.Walls, ceiling and part of the floor painted, a set of drawers moved, and it's a vast improvement on last week...Today we decided to just be completely ruthless and donate everything that is decent rather than do a carboot. The weather is awful, and we don't have the time or energy for it, so the charity shops will get all of my treasures. I hope they sell well for them and I hope people are as happy as I was when I found them and get as much pleasure from owning them as I have.I'm going to keep the quilt I made. It doesn't match anything, but it will keep us warm in winter or be used when playing with my grandchild... I think it might make a good 'tent' draped over the clothes horse when they're a bit bigger, and I'll climb in with them and remember when I did the same as a small child in the 1960s.Since I started writing this earlier we've decided to have wallpaper on one wall. It's money I hadn't expected to spend, but the new door is half the price of the other we were going to buy, so in the end it will only cost around £20 more."},

The clinician was incredibly cheery, and loud. I will do my best, but I'm not sure how that's going to work as I am noise sensitive and feel anything but cheery. I am beginning to think that feeling I had no hope is preferable to having hopes dashed repeatedly.As a consequence of the ED, and the difficulties with the appointments, I have had no inclination to be creative, nor any interest in the house/ hobbies. All my energy goes into looking after our little one, who brings such joy and keeps me going in the bleakest of moments.Circumstances have dictated that we need to clear out the attic room, which on Sunday afternoon looked like this ( and this was an improvement on last week when the floor wasn't visible)... By Sunday evening, some progress had been made...A desk, filing cabinet and bed settee were dismantled and moved to the garage. They were reassembled this morning  and were collected by a charity furniture shop. A broken chest of drawers went to the tip, some textiles to recycling, and umpteen bags to the conservatory ready for a charity shop donation trip. An old exercise bike ( bought secondhand 12 years ago and used regularly) and an old radiator were collected by the scrap metal men this morning, making a bit more space in the garage.I spent an hour up there late on Monday afternoon while my husband was out running... 2 more black sacks for textile recycling, 3 bags of vintage linen for a car boot, a bag of rubbish to the dustbin, and a coat of paint on the wardrobe frame. We're going to do one car boot sale, and anything that's left will be donated, no matter how much it's worth. Everything was bought or made really cheaply, I've enjoyed owning the things and it's time they went elsewhere, including my Hornsea Saffron, and the red, white and blue quilt I made.Shown on a king sized bed. After all that work, it's never been used, just placed over a sofa bed.I spent another hour on Tuesday and just half an hour yesterday as I was very tired. I made a bit more progress but there is still much to do. Once cleared I need to paint the walls/ ceiling, floor, skirting boards and 2 storage units, make curtains to cover the horrible, circa 1970, fitted wardrobes (not seen on these photographs), and revamp 2 chairs.The room will be revamped without spending any money apart from a new door at the entrance to the room."},

I'll have to battle the system again on Monday.It's all such a mess, because it's a grossly underfunded service, in an NHS that is on its knees, and each impending appointment/ fallout from an appointment/ cancellation of an appointment causes a downward spiral and escalation of poor behaviours around food/ eating/ body image.

It was £175, but 3 seater Alston sofas retail at well over £1000. It's also perfect with the patterned one...The Laura Ashley sofa was donated to the charity shop, and is for sale for a lot more than I paid for it.My husband's football boots split weeks ago. He'd looked in the shops for a new pair but everything was way above his flinch point. He found a pair for £6 in the charity shop where I later found the sofa, and when I checked on ebay an identical pair were £109.99.After buying 2 sofas in 2 months, and not needing anything further, I won't be searching for more things so am publishing this before the end of July.I probably won't be around unless I have anything to put into an August bargains post."},

I saw this in a charity shop for £195. My daughter thought it was hideous, but I liked it.I also liked a 3 seater sofa and armchair in peacock blue, but that wouldn't have matched my dining table and a few other pieces in the room. I don't have the mental capacity, energy or budget for changing all that, however much I liked the sofa and chair.When I looked again a week or so later the patterned sofa had been reduced to £136, my husband was with me and he liked it too, so we bought it. I donated the striped one to the same shop, and it was sold quickly for just £5 less than I'd originally paid in a different charity shop several years ago.Multiyork made high quality sofas, but sadly went into administration in 2017."},

Eating Disorder", "date": "Tuesday 27 June 2023", "text": "I've had problems around food for most of my life.I've now been diagnosed with an eating disorder that controls my life and is damaging my health.This was sent to me today. I don't know the source, but it's a good description of what this is like.I no longer cook, I eat alone, mainly when there's nobody in the house to see me, particular crockery and cutlery are used, I avoid situations where there's lots of food or people are eating as it makes me panic. Baking a birthday cake and being around food and lots of people at our little one's 1st birthday party caused a downward spiral and a big weight loss.I'm 6 sizes smaller than I used to be, can look at clothing on a hanger and think it looks small, fit into it then look in the mirror and see fat.When the words 'eating disorder' are said, most people picture a teenage female. My first encounter with someone who was diagnosed with an eating disorder was a schoolfriend...  a teenager, but a boy. Now here I am at the age of 58, feeling unfixable because it's such entrenched behaviour of well over 50 years. I've been told there is hope, and I have professionals willing to help, so I'm going to try.The effort that's going to take, on top of everyday life, with chronic illness thrown in, is going to take all my energy, so I probably won't be around for a while.I know this is a very personal post, something that hasn't happened for some time. I also know that I don't owe anyone an explanation, but I have a small, and seemingly regular number of readers, and didn't want to just disappear.If you think someone you know has problems around food, please encourage them to seek help sooner rather than later. I thought I wasn't ill enough, or worthy of help, and that's just not true."},

The gravel is bagged up ready to be used in our daughter's garden and the surviving strawberries will also go to her garden.The aim is to fill this border with plants as cheaply as possible. I've been buying up reduced stuff when I've seen it, I've bought some shrubs in Poundland for £2 each, have some things that are currently in pots, some stuff at the allotment,  and some stuff to split. Despite that, I suspect that I'm not going to have anywhere near enough, so plan to pop in some French beans to grow up a wigwam, and a courgette or two to fill some gaps.The seat we rescued from the kerbside several years ago has had a lick of paint to change it from worn out grey to black.Midway through painting this areaFinished... and the fences have also gone from grey to black. There are 2 more panels to paint of the 7 across the back of the garden, and then 26 pieces of wood and 3 fence posts for some new fencing we're putting in.

This definitely qualifies though, even if it's not very interesting to anyone else...... 26 pieces of wood to make our new fences. We bought 24 @£1 each, and the manager gave us 2 spares free of charge. The woodyard, run by a charity, is always our first port of call.

{"title": "How did we do...", "date": "Monday 3 April 2023", "text": "... with our Winter energy usage?The answer is that I think we did well.In the last 10 months we've spent a total of £1015.80 on gas and electricity.Our highest Winter bill was for mid November to mid December and was for £135.53.The £67 per month help from the government was paid into my bank account each month by my energy provider because my account was always well in credit. I also took 2 refunds; one of £200, and one of £67.48 as I'd built up such a large credit on the account.As of today, my account is still £371.40 in credit. I could have reduced my payments from £155 but chose not to, and probably won't.For reference: I live in the North West of England in a place where it rains a lot. I struggle particularly with what I term 'damp cold', as I have arthritis in my hands, feet, cervical, thoracic and lumbar spine ( all diagnosed), and I suspect it's in my knees and hips too. I have a heart condition, hypertension ( controlled by 3 medications) and I have ME/CFS. I live in a 2 bedroom bungalow that has had the attic converted to a room, the ceiling height downstairs is 10 feet and my daughters think it's the coldest house we've ever owned...but neither lived in our first house when it was heated solely by a gas fire in the living room and we had ice on the inside of the windows in Winter.I/ we look after the baby anything between 2 and 4 days per week from 8am to 2pm. All of these are factors affecting our usage, particularly ensuring the baby is warm enough, but just like we've been doing since we were children, we've dressed in layers, used blankets on the sofa, worn pyjamas in bed ( and even my dressing gown on some of the nights I've moved to the spare room) and used hot water bottles as we can't stand sleeping in an overly warm room."},

It was well established when we bought the house 12 years ago this month, and we loved it for 11 years, but alas it finally came to the end of its life after a last hurrah in 2022.That prompted a change, and my husband has been gradually cutting it, and a Virginia creeper, back and filling the brown bin. There's still the dead foliage on the pergola that goes over the steps down into the garden, and on the garage, to cut back, but the trellis has been removed and our view down the garden now looks like this...Fortunately, we transplanted some shrubs from the allotment to the garden in 2020, and they're now tall enough to provide some cover so that we don't feel as if we're in a goldfish bowl when sitting on the patio area outside the back door.It's the latest change in the garden. 2020 saw us knock down a shed, and remove dead/ dying shrubs, masses of ivy, a compost area and rubbish, to give us an extra 400 square feet that had been hidden at  the bottom of the garden, and can be seen in these photographs...By opening it up we gained an area for an arbour, 2 new flower beds, a brick built barbecue and space for a table and chairs. There's still tidying to be done and dead foliage to be cleared, but it's wonderful to see things springing back to life. I'm just sad that the wonderful clematis that seemed to glow in the fading light of late Spring evenings, and smelled of honey and vanilla, isn't among them anymore."},

The pile of prunings and dead wood will be burned when we get a suitable day for a fire.The fruitcage has almost been dug over now. There's a massive problem with bindweed in there, and under the paths is solid with roots.The flower bed has been weeded. I thought the lupins had been lost, but they're just much slower in this bed for some reason.  The ones at the top of the plot are much further on.Large rhubarb bed dug over and weeded and the raspberries pruned right back.The shallots are in and covered. I got these for £1 a pack in Poundland yesterday, and might get some more if they still have them next time I go to town.The long bed has had dead foliage removedBuds are appearing on the fruit treesThe alstroemeria is through. We have some in the greenhouse at home which are much further on with being under glass.Buds on the clematis Rhubarb in a different spot, that's much further on than that in the rhubarb patchI couldn't resist bringing some home!There's much less to do on the half plot so apart from moving some things from one shed to another we didn't work on there today."},

I've repaired the badges that attach to a family member's uniform and tailored a pair of their trousers and returned them today. I like to do things quickly when they're for someone else. I've also modified a cosytoes for the umbrella fold buggy we bought recently to use when we take the baby out in the car. My sprung pram is great for walking but too big to fit in our i10. The cosytoes is a generic one and didn't have a piece to go over the back of the buggy seat to prevent it from slipping down, so I added one using fabric from a broken umbrella, and a piece of velcro. I had to add the velcro as the added piece covered the velcro on the back of the pram that the hood attaches to.I need to knit something for one of my younger daughter's colleagues who goes on maternity leave at the end of this month. I have plenty of my late mother in law's yarn for that.There are some changes planned for the shower room and toilet so I've begun to gather things for those projects. Some items have been charity shopped, and some bought for reduced prices from TK Maxx. I have paint left from doing the spare bedroom but we will need tiles, wood, a new toilet and flooring. We're in no rush to do it as it's a want not a need, and our days are currently busy with the baby, and the allotment and gardens when the weather allows.Fingers are firmly crossed that the snow forecast for Thursday/ Friday misses us."},

I found one reduced from £20 to £5 and snapped it up. It was grey velour and a bit grubby, so I gave it a good vacuum, used Nancy Birtwhistle's ' dry-ish cleaning' method, then left it to dry before vacuuming it again. Finally, I re-covered it in the remaining half of the sheet I used to cover the other one when I originally revamped the front bedroom.I've also bought a stainless steel 3 tier steamer for £6, a pure cotton duvet cover for £3, a pure cotton duvet cover and pillowcases for £5, a puddlesuit to put away for the baby for when they're walking £2.49, a fleece lined jacket for the baby £2.59, a brand new with tags dressing gown for the baby £1.49, and a cellular blanket for the baby for £2.All were charity shopped and in immaculate condition. I'm always on the lookout for things that we need, and secondhand is always my first port of call."},

My husband hung it yesterday.It was a day for doing jobs that we'd been putting off as I finally re-covered the rocking chair.I used a vintage wool blanket that had been languishing in a suitcase in the attic...... then made a cushion using something else that had been in the attic for too long.

They don't have a huge number of items, but I have bought cards from there ready for baby's birthday and Christmas and one from them to give to their daddy on his birthday.The cards are good quality, are delivered quickly, and they often have free shipping offers.Cards are quite widely available online, but in my experience it's been more difficult to find reasonably priced books.In knitting news, I've started a cot blanket ready for when the baby transfers from bedside crib to cot, and I'm knitting various baby hats in what, at the moment, seems to be the vain hope of finding one that fits, as the sizing on patterns is so vastly different.

It took 100g of yarn (inherited from my mother in law), and 7 secondhand vintage buttons from the stash, so cost me nothing but time. There was just enough yarn left to add the collar, and to stitch on the buttons.It's a 6-9 month pattern, which I lengthened ( 14 rows in the body, 4 rows in the sleeve.)I've just cast on for another, and have also finished a quilt top so need to look in the attic for some backing fabric for it and get it pinned up."},
{"title": "Fit for purpose ", "date": "Friday 23 September 2022", "text": "I finished this today for my grandchild. It's just a simple quilt to be used when they're playing on the floor. They have a play gym but the mat is a slippery fabric, making rolling more difficult.I used fabric from the stash...there's pyjamas that belonged to the baby's mum when she was a teenager ( she's now 27), my mum's old gingham kitchen curtains, fabric left from making my elder daughter's school dresses when she was in the infants ( she's now 34), old shirts, some fabric sent to me by a blog friend, and some passed on by my elder daughter. I backed it with a single tab top curtain that was charity shopped ages ago, and as it wasn't quite big enough I added a piece of old, plain red duvet cover that I'd kept, which I also used around the edges. I didn't even bind it, just folded the edges over, and hand stitched it down.The label was made from part of an old shirt, stitched with thrifted thread.The only thing I bought was some wadding that cost £4.It's not fancy, but it's fit for purpose, and I hope my grandchild has many happy hours playing on it."},
{"title": "Not bitter ", "date": "Monday 12 September 2022", "text": "I'm exercising my right to reply without having to take over the comments section of someone else's blog.I've been accused of leaving a bitter comment, by two anonymous commenters. They're always anonymous aren't they? In a comment  I left on a blog this morning I stated that I felt nothing at the death of someone I don't know and who has lived a long life, that her eldest son thinks it's beneath him to move an inkwell, and that her second son ran his hands over his own daughter's backside while she was looking at floral tributes.I've barely watched coverage of the aftermath of the Queen's death, because I'm not that interested, but I have seen the footage of both of those incidents, and of a woman snubbing the mixed race member of the family, then smirking and laughing about it, and of a teenager hugging that same member of the family to let her know she's welcome here.I am not bitter, I was just stating facts. I am not upset by the death of a privileged old lady. I didn't know her. I've never met her, just seen her pass by in a car when I was a child. My mother has a letter, signed by her, that was sent when my dad was awarded his BEM almost 50 years ago.I am aghast at a man's inability to move an item along a desk himself, and his clear irritation that it was in the way, and having seen the face of his wife in the background I can hazard a guess that she felt something similar, or maybe embarrassment. In the time he spent gesticulating for it to be moved, he could have done it himself.I am sickened by the actions of his brother; a man who fraternised with a convicted paedophile, including post conviction , who was himself accused of having sex with a trafficked minor, and who was filmed running his hand down his daughter's back and buttocks whilst she was looking at floral tributes. The anonymous two... would you leave a young female relative, or indeed any young female, alone with that man? In addition, I am disturbed by the fact that people showing any kind of dissent are being arrested; a woman holding up a sign saying 'not my king' was led away by police, another woman was charged for holding up a sign saying ' fuck imperialism, abolish monarchy', a young man was arrested for shouting  'Andrew, you're a sick old man', and a barrister was questioned for holding up a blank piece of paper in Parliament Square.If this was happening in another country there would be shouts from the UK about human rights, and the right to protest. Unfortunately, our right to do just that was eroded by the Policing Bill which was passed earlier this year, with barely a murmur from anyone.I make no apology for not feeling sad that the Queen has died. She was a privileged lady, who grew old and died. That's the natural order of things. If you're lucky, you grow old, and have the best of care whilst doing so. Not many people can say their parents or grandparents have enjoyed the same privilege. The majority muddle on, hoping their relatives don't have a long wait for an ambulance, that they don't have to lie on a hospital trolley in a corridor for hours on end, or that they don't die in a noisy hospital ward.I also make no apology for commenting on the less than favourable actions of two of the Queen's sons. If someone who wasn't royalty had behaved in that way, would people turn a blind eye or make excuses for them? I think not.Grieve for the Queen, equate her with your mum or your grandma, think that she played a huge part in your life, feel sad, lay flowers, pray for her, cheer for the King if that's what you want to do. I won't abuse you for doing so.Just don't expect everyone to feel the same, call us bitter if we dare to say that we don't, or arrest those who say it out in the world when the royals happen to be in the vicinity."},

I had some in the attic, picked up either at a carboot or charity shop for pennies, so spent some time this afternoon stitching some detail, and then blanket stitching around the edges.I just need to buy the frames and get the pictures up.Small changes, that are going to change the look of the kitchen and much cheaper than the subway tiles I was thinking of buying."},

I still have the denim patchwork I made. Eventually it will be used for something else.In March 2019, I painted it orange and covered it in the grey fabric. I can't remember when I swapped to the orange barkcloth... maybe 2020. I can't find photos of when I originally did it. At that time I added some leftover wadding to the foam that I'd replaced earlier to make it more padded, and my husband added the solid seat using an offcut of MDF he had in the garage. I painted the frame black last year when I painted behind the glass splashback.Now it has the grey fabric back on it, prompted by the purchase of some artwork for the wall behind it... the orange barkcloth just didn't go with what I bought.

It was white, which wasn't the colour she wanted, but I bought it anyway.I was going to swap it with the black shade on my hallway lamp, giving her the black one, but the fitting was too small for the wide lamp base.Instead, I used the fabric left over from making her new cushion covers earlier this year, to cover the shade.I glued it at the top and bottom on the inside, then covered it over with black electrical tape.I used up the leftover fabric, and the lampshade goes perfectly with her black and neutral decor, so it was a win all round."},

I bought it secondhand years ago and completely revamped it. It's had a new seat, new foam, and this is its 3rd different fabric. It's also been painted red, then the orange and now black... This is what my kitchen looked like when it had just been fitted, with a plain glass splashback...I was never really happy with it, but a coat of black paint on the wall behind it last year made all the difference...I recently toyed with the idea of removing the splashback and tiling with subway tiles but decided against it, so yesterday I freshened my kitchen up with a coat of paint, and gave everything a clean and tidy. It's still the same colours, as I like the black and white, but it looks clean and fresh again, for no cost as I used what I had in the garage...In crafting news...... the grey blanket is finally finished.

{"title": "Never a finished article ", "date": "Tuesday 28 June 2022", "text": "An allotment is never a finished article as there's always something to do. This year in particular,  the weeds are rampant, and being laid low with a virus for several weeks recently( I'm still coughing, and it wasn't another bout of Covid), and not being able to do what was needed didn't help matters, but we're gradually getting back on top of things...Looking from the bottom of plot 7... From the side of the greenhouse...From the end of the flower bed...From the side of the peas ( covered by the green net)...From the top of the plot looking back...On plot 7 we have apple, pear and cherry trees, black, red and white currant bushes, gooseberries, strawberries and raspberries, rhubarb, potatoes, Jerusalem artichokes, peas, French beans, broad beans, shallots, beetroot, asparagus, lettuce, rocket, Spring onions, tomatoes and cucumber. Most of that is on the lower half. We have alstromeria, red hot pokers, foxgloves, daisies, poppies, gladioli, dahlias, lupins, hostas, violets, lavender, honeysuckle, clematis, jasmine, irises and numerous flowering shrubs. We look after the top half as it's unlettable due to the high walls on 2 sides ; it doesn't provide enough growing space with sufficient light for vegetables and is riddled with mare's tail, bindweed and brambles ( they were over 7' high when we agreed to look after it).We've tried to make it as wildlife friendly as possible, with lots of flowers, wilder areas and a second small pond.The soft fruit in the cage is almost ready to be picked, but doing that will involve hacking my way in there through the bindweed that has engulfed everything.Plot 9a...The compost bin on here is now stacked 6' high after weeding plot 7 this morning. We also have 4 compost bins on there.Plot 9a is a disappointment this year. The weeds are rampant, coming from the adjoining field. A lot of the onion seedlings were washed away by torrential rain shortly after planting and our courgettes failed, or were badly slug damaged so we don't have any this year. My spiraliser won't see the light of day this Summer! On here we have strawberries, raspberries, what's left of the onions, newly planted leeks ( they survived the torrential downpour last Friday just after they were planted), chives,mint, clematis, dogwood, foxgloves, spring and summer bulbs, and lots of poppies, which we harvest the seeds from.Allotments are rewarding, even if seeing the plots overrun by weeds feels overwhelming at times. I know we're not the only ones who think the weeds are worse this year, or who have had failures with seed sowing, and crops due to the weather and pests. I enjoy the peace and quiet, and the hard physical work when my body allows it.On the crafting front, I'm part way through a grey wrap over cardigan for my grandchild, and have picked up the grey blanket again for some easy TV knitting while Wimbledon is on."},

I painted them black using paint I already had.The bench was rescued from a skip at our old allotment site many years ago. The ends are very heavy cast iron, but the wood was left in the skip and replaced because it was rotten. We used it at the old house and brought it with us 11 years ago. It too had a paint job. I didn't have any paint suitable for outdoor use on the wood, so used the same black silk emulsion that's on the walls in the bathroom and toilet. It's been outside for about 6 weeks and still looks perfect despite lots of rain, and some sun. I figured if it didn't work I'd have to buy a small tin of something more suitable, but it was best to try first.The plant stand that can be seen at the left hand side with the geraniums in was £3 at the carboot years ago,  and after being in the garden all that time was rusting and the paint was peeling, so I treated the rust with inhibitor from the garage and painted it black to match everything else.The fake greenery was £19.99 from Home Bargains  and was bought many months ago to use at the bottom of the garden as there was still a space between our trees where I could see the huge, imposing house at the back since they hacked lots of shrubs in 2020. My planting has grown sufficiently in the last few months to cover it, so I was left with the roll. It was too late to return it, so I used it to cover the lower half of the glass in the conservatory. My husband just staple gunned it to an old, unused trellis and propped it into position so it can be stored in the garage over Winter.The only recent spend was £19.99 for the outdoor rug from Aldi, bought to cover the paving that my husband hates so much as despite jet washing it soon becomes dirty again. Water and electricity are expensive, so spending £19.99 on a rug that will last many years was a cost effective choice... and it keeps the weeds down!"},

I bought 2 boxes for £3 each at TK Maxx in May 2021, and had 4 leftHandles, £4, TK Maxx March 2022I need 10 Handles in total, so now have enough.Sheet and pillowcases £13 Primark, February 2022I have a white duvet set I can use.Table,  £1, charity shop in Northenden in 2019. We bought 2 and they've been used in the garden. This is the smaller one. I've got some rust converter left from rescuing some garden chairs in 2019 so will use that on it, then spray paint it. This will be a bedside table.2 x 2.5 litres sage green paint. £9 per can ( on offer instead of £14 per can) Wickes, March 2022White spray paint, £2.50, Poundland March 2022The sage green paint is for the ceiling and walls above the picture rail. Below will be white, which I'll buy next month.Shade for standard lamp and doilies/ lace from the attic. The lamp base is still up there. I need to strip the paint off it. The base was £3 at auction and the shade was £1, over 5 years ago. The doilies and lace were very cheap at auction/ carboots in the same sort of time frame, and I sold those in colours I knew I'd never use. I ended up with more money than I'd paid in the first place, and still had all the neutral ones I wanted. I also have a Lloyd Loom bedside cabinet bought for £5 in the charity furniture shop 6 years ago, that I used to use in the spare bedroom but which is currently stored in the eaves space. That will be painted sage green and used at the other side of the 'bed'. I have a wooden framed bed settee in the attic which will be moved downstairs, and left opened out as a bed permanently.I'm going for a green/ neutral look, with lots of plants, and waxed wood ( the wardrobe and dressing table will also be stripped back... they're currently dark blue, and have been grey, and before that, green).The room will be light, bright and calming; very different to its current look, which is lovely, but too 'busy' for my tasteCurrently on the needles......another baby blanket. It's  Marianna's easy basketweave design. I haven't knit this one before, but am enjoying it."},

When I got them out I found that the covers were damaged ( they were that cheap, paper type fabric), so I removed the originals and made new ones from part of a pure cotton vintage sheet that I'd bought for £1 at a carboot sale years ago.I then made simple envelope back covers from the cream fabric seen here. I made a pair and they go well with the owner's existing cushions.This magazine holder was passed on to me about 10 years ago, but it's been stored in the attic for the last few years as my living room is no longer green.I bought a can of white spray paint for £2 at Poundland, and sprayed it. Most was done outside, but the last touch up had to be done in the kitchen as it had become windy outside. Plastic sheeting and tins of beans/ tomatoes to the rescue!        The room was well ventilated, and I wore a                                           safety mask.I finished this pram blanket last night and the cardigan this afternoon. The yarn is the same chunky as I used for the larger blanket. It was 70 stitches, 6mm needles, 2 x 100 gram balls, total cost of £1.98. The cardigan took less than 1 x 100gram ball, and the yarn was inherited from my late mother in law.The rethink is the lampshade mentioned in my last post. I'm hoping to use up a lot of vintage doilies in the revamp, but I wasn't happy with my first attempt at placing them, so will have to look again in a couple of weeks and hope inspiration strikes. There's no rush for it as the room it's destined for needs quite a bit of work.I've cast on for  another pram blanket, and should really make a  start on cutting the fabric for the patchwork I'm going to make."},

They haven't had the strings pulled to gather them either.I've also made a cushion with some of the pillowcase fabric, adding a thin layer of wadding behind the front piece, and stitching around the white, yellow and turquoise parts of the pattern to anchor it.I'll ask for photographs when they're hung in position in the nursery, but the curtain police should look away if I get them, as the curtains are not windowsill length, or floor length, but somewhere in between, and I know how much some people are offended by that!For an outlay of around £45 (duvet set x 2, double flat sheet x 2, curtain tape, orange and beige fabric) I have, so far, made 66×72\" lined curtains, and a quilted cushion cover, and have lots of fabric left to make a good size patchwork to keep mum warm while she's up feeding baby in the colder months. The orange and beige fabric were bought specifically for the quilt.I was very impressed with the quality of the Marks and Spencer duvet sets ; 100% cotton and very well made with zipped fastenings ( I removed them and they're in my stash now), and I wouldn't hesitate to buy again."},

Ditto with the bookcase. Revamping the bookcase wasn't without its trials, as I discovered that I'd used PVA to stick the wallpaper in the back of it. It was a nightmare to remove the PVA residue, but I managed it.This is the paint I used on both items, which I can highly recommend ...It is by Wickes, and is blue in the tin and when painted on, but it dries to a lovely matt black  I used it on my stairs and it's holding up really well.Next thing is to measure for the nursery curtains tomorrow, and make a start on the footstool as I got the fabric for it on Sunday.And, as usual I've got sone baby knitting on the needles."},

I have some plain white, and possibly some plain grey and that will have to do I think as I couldn't find anything else that wasn't too strongly coloured. I'll be measuring for the curtains next week, but won't have access to my sewing machine until the week after, so curtains and quilt are on the back burner for now.I finished a pair of trousers to go with a baby cardigan I knitted ages ago. I have an identical cardigan and plenty of yarn left so will eventually knit another pair and donate that set to the charity I knit for. I've located my grey yarn so am going to cast on another set to go with a grey, green and white baby Yoda outfit.I've just about finished revamping this tray for someone. It was mine, and has been wooden, then painted white with red/white/blue paper( used in the attic room) then white with a floral paper( used in the conservatory).Now it's just painted, and needs a final coat.Today, I made a start on this bookcase. We bought it 25 years ago ( it didn't have a back then) when it was unfinished pine. Since then it's been white, lilac, white again, black( for the first time) blue, and I've just painted it black again. It also had a back added between white again and black for the first time. It's been used in two homes here, and two in Manchester, and is still going strong.Once those are finished I can make a start on revamping this footstool that I originally did several years ago using vintage fabrics. It's still like new, but doesn't fit in with anything in the house, so will be redone and passed on to a family member to make use of.I'll post photos of the tray, bookcase and footstool when they're finished,which should be fairly soon,  and the quilt and curtains once they're done, which will probably be late February,  early March, health permitting."},

It had the neutral colours that they wanted, but they couldn't find curtains that they liked/ weren't too expensive.I found matching duvet covers on the M&S website, and showed them what could be done.Very soon I'll be turning 2 duvet covers ( total cost of £29) into a pair of curtains. The pillow cases and any excess fabric will be used to make a play quilt, and a cushion for the nursing chair. I'll show you when they're done.The wrong colourway, and much more expensive than 2 single bed sets!In the meantime, I'm plodding on with another pair of baby trousers, to match a cardigan in the pile of stuff I knitted for charity, as I can't find the grey wool that I know is in the attic room... somewhere!"},

Not sure about ears on that one yet, but I already have grey yarn so can make a start as the ears are knitted separately and then attached at the end.The yarn for this cost around £3.50 and the buttons were from my stash. Similar sets in the shops seem to be around the £20 mark, so a good saving."},

It's no fun, and even my super fit husband who was least affected by it, said the same ( his resting heart rate is usually that of an athlete, but almost doubled whilst ill). I still have a cough, ate my first proper meal in 2 weeks at lunchtime today, still can't taste or smell properly, though it has returned a little. Coffee has tasted OK for a couple of days and is now like poison again, and I feel sick every time I eat and have diarrhoea every day. Like I said, no fun.Wishing everyone the Christmas they're hoping for, but if it isn't, please remember that it's only one day, and social media isn't real life, mainly people pretending all is perfect.Tomorrow will be whatever it turns out to be for my family.

I have all the classic symptoms now but had many others before the classics appeared, so please don't dismiss things as being 'just a cold'. I had sneezing, earache, sinus pain, toothache, headache (it felt like it would explode with the pressure), blocked nose, runny nose, chills ( like icy water running through me), eye pain ( both me and my daughter had to wear sunglasses indoors as brightness made them hurt more), fever, agonising joint pain, painful skin, and dry lips, before I got the cough and lost all sense of taste and smell.It's day 5 and I felt a little better when I woke up, but after walking upstairs to get something I was breathless and exhausted and am back in bed. We have a pulse oximeter and have been monitoring. Symptoms are very up and down, and seem to get worse as the day goes on, and symptoms that had disappeared come back... my daughter's sore throat has returned, as has my painful skin. It is bloody exhausting.***Edited to add dizziness and diarrhoea to the symptoms, as they've arrived during the course of today.Good luck getting tested if, like me, you're unfortunate enough to live in England at the moment.  I believe that LFT test kits are unavailable and have just been sent this...Time for a sleep I think.Happy Christmas."},

{"title": "Hallway", "date": "Friday 26 November 2021", "text": "We lived here just short of 2 years before the hallway was sorted. It was the last room in the house to be tackled and was quite a big job. All new doors were fitted by my husband, flooring was laid by him and spindles were hand cut and fitted on the staircase. It was originally papered with lining paper and painted cream. Later it was painted white, and wallpaper was added under the stairs. It had a grey/orange /yellow colour scheme. The stair carpet ( secondhand, over 10 years old) was removed and the stairs painted, and then wallpapered by me.The lining paper had started to come away at the top of the stairwell, and despite gluing it numerous times, it still peeled( it had been on for 9 years). That wall has the eaves space on the other side so is cold, and we have, in the past, had problems with condensation there. That was resolved with a dehumidifier. We decided to remove the lining paper, repair the wall and just paint it. A lot of Polyfilla and sanding later it looked good enough to paint.Enough of what went before, here's the after...The house now flows much better, as all the 'public' spaces have the thread of black running through them, leaving the bedrooms (blue/ pink and navy/ dark green) and the attic room ( red, white, blue) with a lot of colour in them.I bought a lot of new things for this room: radiator cover, lamp, light shades, 5 mirrors, table, old pine hifi unit, but got almost everything reduced. The lamp was £16 instead of £29.99, the table £18 instead of £29.99( it's legs were uneven so I removed the feet and added stick on felt furniture pads that I had). The mirror at the top of the stairs was £9 instead of £24.99 because it had a few small scratches on the frame, easily resolved with a Sharpie. The tightrope walker figurine was £16, reduced from £29.99, and was bought not only because I love it, but as a reminder that I have to strive to find balance where my health is concerned. All items were from the reduced section of TK Maxx. The lightshades were bought from Argos with Nectar points. The candle was £2 , reduced from £5 in Primark. The small mirrors were 50p each in Poundland. One was black, one cream and one grey. All cheap looking plastic, but effective when sprayed gold.The hifi cabinet was £15 from a charity furniture shop, the reeded glass film for its door was £8 from ebay/ Amazon, I forget which. The wallpaper was £16 per roll, reduced from £20. We used 2 rolls. The white emulsion was reduced in Wilko to £12 per can, and we only used one and returned the other. Black paint for the staircase and existing large mirror was £10 from Wickes. Black paint to paint the large plantpot, small clock, and door knob of the understairs cupboard, was left over from painting the shower cubicle. Fabric to re-cover the laundry basket was a £7.63 remnant from Abakhan and I have loads left so might make a window covering for the bottom of the stairs. The radiator cover was a big investment at £110 from Wickes, but is something we've wanted for a long time. White paint for the woodwork was from the garage, and the circular black mirror was £14 in Home Bargains.The room has cost a lot of money ( for us, but it's all relative though isn't it?), but the cost has been spread over months, as I've bought things when I've seen them, and almost everything has been reduced in some way.Now I'm looking forward to decorating the house for Christmas with the black and gold items that my mum recently passed on to me..."},

It stands in a charity shopped planter, which will have cost £1.50 at most as I won't pay more than that.The large cross stitch was part of an auction job lot that I paid a pound or two for. I think there were 7 pictures in the lot. The frame was pine, and I painted it white.The smaller picture is a signed print of Bolton Abbey, and was a gift from my elder daughter.I don't pay much for anything, so that I can swap things around, but this corner has been like this for a while, so I must be happy with it!"},

I keep such things in a cupboard in the garage so I can swap things round. I bought the candle when I moved here 10 years ago and only lit it recently! The candlestick and planter were originally thrifted, and the plant is an offshoot of a spider plant given to me when I worked at the hospital... I left there when I had KL, and she's now 26.The flamingo is a Christmas decoration, bought for £3 ( half price) in January 2019. I painted the base black. The small pot was a 17th birthday gift, and the black leather pot an 18th birthday gift... I am now 56. Those items were moved from the conservatory. I revamped the firescreen several years ago using thrifted doilies ( I think it's on the ' No wonder my fingers were sore post), and painted it black to tie in with the room now. It hides the silver fire. Plants, stands and candles on the hearth were already in use before the colour change.The mirror was painted from silver to cream/ beige using matchpots from the garage.And the £1? I spent it on the clock in a charity shop on a visit to Todmorden last month."},
{"title": "Handmade, homemade", "date": "Tuesday 5 October 2021", "text": "All my cushions are handmade/ homemade. I recently changed colour scheme in the living room, from grey to black. The geometric fabric was from Abakhan and cost just over £6. I got 2 big cushions, a table runner and part of another cushion front from it.Quite a few of the cushion backs, and part of one front were made from my existing cushions, which had been made from a pair of velvet curtains that were hanging in the kitchen when we moved here 10 years ago. The cream was an offcut from some throws I made in 1997, the black with the cream ribbon trim was left over from re-covering my dining chairs, and the plain black was left over from re-covering a sewing box for my daughter. The hare and moon cushion I made several years ago ( it's shown on the 'No wonder my fingers were sore' post). It was in a storage box in the attic until this morning.Both my sofas are secondhand... the cream is by Laura Ashley and was £60 at auction (shop price was around £1200 depending on fabric), the stripe is by Alstons, £120 from Age UK ( brand new price seems to be between £1500 and £2000 for something similar... a label on mine shows it was made in 2011.           Nice things, without the exorbitant price tag."},

We paid for skips, bought an arbour and gravel, but spent very little on plants as the budget was gone.After the annual miracle of everything springing back to life, the result was even better than expected...17th July 2021 23rd May 2021 23rd May 20213rd February 20213rd February 2021The top and bottom photographs were taken from the same spot, 5.5 months apart, and the views down the path were 2.5 months apart.The way the garden springs back to life never ceases to fill me with awe and wonder."},
{"title": "It took a while...", "date": "Saturday 2 October 2021", "text": "but I finally found a use for some of the Liberty fabric I bought back in 2016 and which can be seen in this post.I revamped my bedroom in April ( I was painting with Prince Philip's funeral on TV in the background), and needed to do something with the lampshades. They were in good structural condition but looked shabby.I had a small piece of this... wide enough to go round the lamps and just deep enough for the pair if I cut carefully. The pattern repeat means that one is predominantly pink, and the other predominantly blue... the same but different to look at. I just used a Prit Stick to attach it, folding it over carefully at the top of the shade for a neat finish, and painting the top edge white. I covered the raw bottom edge with a piece of braid from my stash.I used a bigger piece of the Liberty scraps to cover the ceiling shades. They originally had 3 tiers to them, but I removed the bottom 2.I now have pretty light shades that didn't cost the earth."},
{"title": "The latest incarnations ", "date": "Thursday 30 September 2021", "text": "The shower room and toilet have been decorated numerous times since we moved here 10 years ago.Earlier this year I gave them their latest makeover. The shower room was done first, and then I used the leftover materials to do the separate toilet.A lot of people have knocked through to make one large room, incorporating the small adjacent part of the hallway into the floorspace of their new bathroom. We prefer to keep ours separate.I ran the black paint across the door at the same height as on the walls, and am happy with how it turned out.Taken when I first finished the roomTaken today... I've changed the planters for others from around the houseThe multi-surface paint worked well on the exterior metal parts of the shower,and on the plastic parts too. I can't recommend it though, as it is an absolute nightmare to work with.I originally left the door white, but it looked odd, so I carried the black paint across at the same height as the adjacent wall. Fortunately it was the same height as the door frame.We chose black sealant for the shower, as I was sick of having to bleach it to remove mold spots when it was white.I ordered new rollers (£7.99) and door handles (8.99) for the shower, floor tiles and spray adhesive(£35.41), black multi surface paint (19.99) to paint the exterior plastic and metal parts of the shower cubicle all from Amazon as my daughter has Prime and everything was cheaper on there... the floor tiles were almost 50% less than on Dunelm's website! I bought black emulsion for the walls (£16 Wilko), masking tape (£4 Wilko), and black sealant for the shower (£3.49 Screwfix).I removed the old sealant from the shower and my husband resealed it. I removed the shower doors, scrubbed and bleached the seals, removed the rollers and fitted the new ones, then re-fitted the doors. I painted the plastic and metal exterior shower parts black. I masked off the walls, painted the ceiling and top third of the walls white, then painted the bottom part, the radiator, skirting boards and door black.I painted the cupboards, mirror and plant stand black, and my picture frame pink, and finally my husband was able to lay the new flooring.I already had the pink tester pot for painting the picture frame and white emulsion for the ceiling and top of the walls. All the accessories were reused as the bathroom was grey and pink before the revamp. Total cost £95.87Mostly done using leftovers and things from around the houseThe light fitting was a couple of pounds from a charity shop years ago and hung in the kitchen until it was refitted 2.5 years agoThe colours in the bee print tie everything together, and are a nod to the Manchester contingent of the family. The join in the paint was a bit wobbly as the wallpaper had a bit of texture to it. Adding the tape covered that and added a bit of interest too.The original mirror ( it was passed on to me in 1995), and the original planter I bought for £4.99. I preferred it to the one I've ended up with, and it was cheaper!The paint and tiles were left over from doing the shower room, and I used existing plants. I bought duckling tape (£2) washi tape (£5.70) and the picture frame (£17) all from Hobbycraft. The bee print was £9.50 (Etsy), the original planter was £4.99 ( TK Maxx) ,the replacement planter was £6.99 (TK Maxx) and I bought 2 black planters for £6 (Poundland).I also covered some small storage boxes I've had since my teacher training days with black vinyl wrap left over from a project in the living room, then trimmed them with washi tape. You can see a corner of one in the photograph above.Total cost £52.18, with tape and paint left.Doing the toilet was not without its trials. The mirror fell off the wall and smashed the original planter I'd bought. My husband put it back up but I didn't trust it, so I moved the one from the top of the stairs and painted that. I also suffered from first coat collywobbles when I started painting...Fortunately, we had faith in my vision, we're happy with how it turned out, and the new windows which were fitted last week have finished the rooms off nicely."},
{"title": "How many, and a footstool", "date": "Saturday 25 September 2021", "text": "I wonder how many finished articles there have been over the years. It must be hundreds, if not more. I've been sewing since I was 13, renovating/ upcycling furniture since I was 18, and knitting since I was 19. There have been things for me, things for my family and friends, gifts, things I sold for charity, and knitted items that I continue to donate to the neonatal charity at the local hospital. There's been over 40 years of crafting, initially born out of necessity, as when I started sewing it was much cheaper to make than to buy clothes. That isn't the case any more, and it's years since I've sewn for myself, though I did make clothes for my elder daughter, and fancy dress costumes for both of my girls.I'm on an enforced lay off from knitting as I seem to have developed tennis elbow after decorating my bedroom in April ( it hasn't stopped me decorating 2 more rooms and refreshing a third, but knitting every day is too much).There are so many things that have gone undocumented, so I'm going to try putting things I do on here publicly to show that you don't need to spend a fortune to have nice things.This renovation of a footstool was part of my elder daughter's birthday gift...Footstool, £3.50 carboot several years agoHer room is black, gold and cream, and this fabric was left over from when I renovated a rocking chair for her. Now she has a footstool to match.Hi-fi unit £15,  charity shop Sanded, painted black ( leftovers), reeded film ( £7.99 with lots left over for future projects) added to the door, handle changed ( left over from changing handles on living room furniture)Will be sited in soon to be revamped room Bought at auction around 5 years ago for £7 + feesIt had been pink at some pointThe old covering was stripped off, the legs and handle painted,  and then it was re-covered in vintage barkcloth ( 2 pairs of curtains £9, carboot Cleveleys several years ago).It will be re-covered again to match a soon to be revamped room."},

I've also sorted the fabric for a patchwork throw for the revamped conservatory but need to buy some new blades for my rotary cutter.Pictures at some point... the light has been terrible again so far this week."},

I saw them and thought they would look nice on the dresser in the kitchen.I know a lot of people don't like chrysanthemums, but I'm not one of them!I liked them so much I bought two bunches and filled a vase. You can just see from the label that the ' display until' date was 22nd December - the day I went into the shop. You can also see that I actually found something reduced that I wanted to buy, that I paid 30p per bunch, and that the flowers were guaranteed for 14 days.The photos of the flowers in the vase were taken today - day 14 after their purchase. I think they may well last another 14 days if I carry on looking after them."},
{"title": "Christmas Crafting UPDATED", "date": "Monday 26 December 2016", "text": "I like making and renovating things, and my family like the things that I  make and renovate, so there are always renovated and handmade gifts at Christmas. These are this year's. Some of the before photographs aren't very good due to very poor light at the time I started the renovations.BookcaseWe've had this since the girls were small, but it has been in the garage for a few years and was covered in dirt. I gave it a good scrub, painted it black, and added a hardboard back which had 3 different wallpaper samples attached. ChairThis was one of a set of 4 chairs that I bought for £9 in 2014, just before we gave up having a car; we were car-free for 2 years and 3 months before buying one in June 2016. They have been in the garage since then. They're a teak colour wood, and have the most awful, dirty, dark chartreuse corduroy seat covers. The fabric was stripped off, the wood was painted black, and the old thin seat foam was replaced with some thick wadding. I then re-covered the seat in some gorgeously soft and tactile black faux fur fabric. I made a matching cushion, which can be used either on the chair or on her bed.FootstoolI wasn't using the rosy footstool, and K loved it because of the shape and the legs so I renovated it for her and A to use in their home. I stripped off the fabric, and as I was gifting it I also replaced the old foam. The chipboard was used as a template and the foam cut to size. It was then covered with some thin wadding, and a cover made to fit. This was stapled in place, and the bottom of the footstool was covered in red felt( I forgot to photograph the underside). I then attached some black ribbon and re-used the red braiding. These were stitched on together.Hot water bottle coversI made these for K's in-laws. Both were made from vintage wool blankets, and were decorated with felt. and finished with ribbon.BagI made this from a pattern that I've used a lot. The pattern gives the bag long handles, but I had these handles, which cost me 20p at a carboot sale, and thought they would look good with the shape of the bag's body. The fabric is vintage towelling, and it's lined with white curtain lining.The recipient is going on holiday to sunnier climes early in the new year so it should be perfect for that.Patchwork quiltI made this for K and A's spare room, which is decorated in lavender and grey. The fabric is all thrifted. There are men's shirts, a damaged Boden blouse, a couple of Next cushion covers, a white blouse, a duvet cover and some vintage white sheeting in it. The back is vintage white sheeting. It was machined together but has been hand quilted in the ditch.  I stitched a label and attached it to the back... she has called me 'Mim' for years.All of the gifts were well received by the recipients, my fingers are just about healed, and I've started to think about what to make next, but first we need to sort out the attic room, so that I have a ' studio' where I can create to my heart's content and help to make my daughter's dreams come true.**************Updated to say that there was something weird going on with the blog, so I've removed all the posts except the last couple for now."},
{"title": "Traditional for us", "date": "Friday 23 December 2016", "text": "After an enforced pyjama day yesterday I felt well enough today to get dressed and to get on with some baking. It is traditional here to bake chocolate brownies for Christmas. It used to be done by KL and I on Christmas Eve with Michael Buble crooning along in the background. Baking together came to an end last year due to her working ( she had a part-time job whilst at uni, and now works full-time), so this morning I baked alone, with Smooth Northwest playing in the background. It isn't the same as those happy times spent baking together, and that ' Christmas feeling' is sadly lacking here.Some of the brownies may end up being eaten as dessert on Christmas Day.It is also traditional to take cake when we go to see K and A,; due to logistics we will now be spending Christmas Day at their house, with K's in-laws and KL. The family favourite is carrot cake; apparently the recipe I use is better than any other eaten anywhere, by any of my family, so that too was baked. We'll enjoy it on Christmas Eve.It is also traditional to make a fat-free, eggless fruit cake, to which I add glace cherries and flaked almonds, and place blanched almonds on the top so that it resembles a Dundee cake.Some of the baking will be frozen so that KL can take it back with her when she returns to her home.It has also been traditional for us to eat leek and mushroom Wellington for Christmas lunch for the last few years, and we have been eating leeks in cheese sauce with our Christmas lunch for donkey's years. To that end, J got out his garden fork when he arrived home from work this evening and dug up plenty of leeks for me. They've been trimmed and washed ready for me to make the individual Wellingtons to take to K's.No Christmas cake, Christmas pudding, mince pies or turkey, but things that are traditional for us.We also have a new tradition of attending a Parkrun on Christmas Day. Last year J and A ran it, along with A's uni friend M who was in the north-west visiting family for Christmas. This year it will just be J and A, with the females of the family cheering from the sidelines.Do you have anything that is traditional for you at Christmas, but which is a little different ?"},
{"title": "The last", "date": "Thursday 22 December 2016", "text": "The last week has been fraught to say the least, and not of my making. Yesterday I escaped from the hassle and the madness and came home for a couple of hours, in order to save my sanity. I tidied and cleaned KL's room ready for her , and put up a Christmas tree in there. It's the one that she and K had in their room when they were children.All of the baubles are old. Some are vintage glass ones, but the majority were passed on to me by my Mum in the mid 1990s. It's not the best I have ever decorated a tree, but it was done with love, and I'm sure she will appreciate it when she sees it.That's the last tree, and the last of the crafting is complete. The sun came out just long enough between downpours yesterday to enable me to take some photographs of the things that I have made/ renovated, so once they have been given to the recipients I will be able to post them. I still have presents to wrap, cakes and brownies to make and the house to clean, so I'd better go and get on with it."},
{"title": "Up the wooden hill", "date": "Monday 19 December 2016", "text": "When we decorated the hall  we removed the wallpaper that was at the top of the stairs as it no longer matched the soft furnishings. It was a shame as I liked the paper, and I didn't want to have to buy a roll of wallpaper for a very small area, but it had to go. I decided to have a patchwork wall, which meant that no money would need to be spent. I went to a shop and picked up several wallpaper samples in neutral colours of creams and greys; colours that are in my ' new' curtains. The paper was cut into squares and then applied in a random pattern before my £1 mirror, which finally got its paint job, was hung... and most of the pictures have been hung on the staircase wall too.All have some significance to us, from windmills, to a Cornish village, to Hanover."},

I also have decorations in the hall and lounge/ front room/ room ( I alternate between the 3 names for it as I've used them all over the years - different names were picked up depending which area of the country I was living in at the time).I've decided to put the final tree in KL's room ready for when she arrives for a few days over Christmas.Here are photos of the hall and ' that room'!My little fibre optic tree ( a gift from my parents circa 1992) and candle arrangement fit well on the plant stand.I swapped the Autumn leaves cushion for a stag's head one.I put an old candle ( I've had it around 10 years!) and some old decorations ontothe plate at the bottom of the stand and added a bit of ivy from the gardenEverything on the tree is at least 15  years old; some of the things came off some posh Christmas crackers that my Mum bought years ago! The tree topper is actually an old bauble that I turned upside down and attached.Two intertwined garlands have been attached to the banisters ( which were handmade bymy talented husband). Both garlands are donkey's years old- in fact I've had one since I livedat the ' old, old house', and we left there in 1992. I always put the garland away with the baubles still attachedso all I have to do is add some ivy, and the ' picks'.Just the same as usual in this room. The fireplace has been decorated, there's an arrangement on the table, and the Christmascards we gave to each other 15+ years ago are on displayThe fireplace is decorated with another donkey's years old garland, ivy from the garden, a few old ornaments and baubles and the felt poinsettias I stitched a few years ago - I think it was in 2012.There was a clump of ivy left over so I popped it on the corner of the firescreen. Bathed in sunshine; it was so lovely that I had the windows open all day.The tree. It's decorated with a mixture of old and new.The Father Christmas, the heart and the little house were bought by my parents in the early days of their marriage.I remember them from my childhood. They hang alongside modern baubles which were all bought in the post Christmas sales, and vintage baubles that I've bought in charity shops and at carboot sales for pennies.This was in a bag of red baubles I bought at a charity shop near K and A's old homea few years ago.The legs at the bottom of the tree are hidden by a garland I bought at the sale in Next when I lived at the old house ( we left there in 2011) . It was reduced from £18 to £4 and I used to have it in the conservatory when I lived there as that wasdecorated in green. Nothing is disposed of here - it just moves rooms! The pine cones and other bits are from a bag of pot pourri that my Mum bought and didn't use.My ' Christmas at the ........' sign that K made . It usually sits in front of the wedding photographs but I moved it when I took the photos so that my surname couldn't be seen. It's an unusual name, there are only a few of us in the town where I live and we are all related through J's great, great grandfather. The little fairy house was made by K's mother-in-law and was a gift to me.Those cards that are brought out year after year, alongside the one my Mum sent to us this year. The caseunderneath the table was a gift to me from K and A last Christmas.' The new sofa', which had to be dismantled to fit through the doorway! The stag's head Christmas cushions I made last yearare on it, and I've spent quite a few hours reclining whilst watching ' The Crown' on Netflix .That's it for now decoration wise, until I sort KL's room ready for her visit. Some things need to be moved out of it, it needs a thorough clean and then the final Christmas tree can go up."},

Today it just had the equivalent of a fringe trim! A bucket of greenery and the gold wreath on top of my plastic sheeting which came from one of the £1 shops ( I forget which one). It's been one of the best things I have ever bought!I pushed the greenery into the hoop, working in a clockwise direction. Ten minutes later it was full. I attached some wire to the back, fixed on a silk poinsettia, and hung it on the front door; I haven't trimmed it to make it look even as I like the slightly ' tousled' look. Twenty minutes from cutting the hebe in the garden, to the wreath being hung on the front door, and with no financial cost as I've had the wreath and the poinsettia for donkey's years and both were passed to me by my Mum.I've finished the decorations in 3 rooms now. I will do the conservatory if I have the time and energy, but finishing gifts is a priority.This is the kitchen decked out for Christmas - it was a very quick and easy job as the tree is put away each year with the baubles on it and the rest is very simple.   A  few glitzy bits on my Ercol dresser My £1 white tree, with very old baubles on it, a dish of baubles, pine cones and a garland of bells, and 2 gold trees which were passed on to me by my MumA garland of bells and my 2 little angels, chosen by my girls when they were small.Matching, but still full of memories."},

It's safer that way, even if that means that the blog is a poor reflection of me. There will always be people who read something that isn't actually there and decide to have a go, and quite frankly I can't be bothered with that... even less so than usual at the moment.So, here's the bread and butter pudding post...I popped into Asda one evening recently and actually found some yellow stickered itemsWhen I saw the brioche rolls I immediately thought of bread and butter pudding. It was a firm favourite as a child, and my Dad often made it with stale bread, probably to help fill us up because money was very tight when I was a child, even though I didn't know that at the time.The rolls were sliced, buttered, and layered with a scant sprinkle of sugar, dried cranberries and sultanas then an egg beaten with some soya milk was poured over  Baked in a moderate oven for as long as it takes - I use a mini oven ( because that's all I have,  need or want) which cooks this much more quickly than a full size oven. I cover it with foil which is removed for 5 minutes or so when it is almost cookedA generous portion for J Served with some lovely custard, it went down a treat on a cold evening."},
{"title": "Sewing and painting", "date": "Friday 2 December 2016", "text": "It's been a busy week and I've accomplished a lot; not all of it can be shown because some of the things I've been doing are Christmas gifts. Yesterday I finished painting the drawers in the conservatory, removed all of the veneer from the top of my treadle sewing machine table because I couldn't stand it any longer ( it was damaged when I bought it a few years ago), re-covered the Ercol chair and finished painting a mirror for the hallway.Today has been slightly less busy; I've done a bit of shopping, visited my Mum, painted another mirror for the hallway, tidied some stuff away from KL's bedroom as she'll be visiting over Christmas, put the first coat of paint onto the treadle tabletop and metalwork, made a ' chicken', leek and mushroom pie and an apple and blackcurrant crumble ( some for tea today, leftovers for tomorrow so that I don't need to cook), processed some veg and stale bread, made another Scrabble picture for the hallway, scrubbed the kitchen floor, cleaned the bathroom and toilet. There may be other things but that's all I can think of for now!Here are the before and after pictures of the Ercol chairOn the left is the chair as it was when I bought it in 2012. On the right is the chair as it looked once I had sanded and re-covered it in June 2012. We had it in the lounge until we got the new sofa and furniture from my Mum in December 2014. It has since been either in the attic room or the conservatory.This is the chair now; it's plain and simple.It has a new home in the hallway. I re-covered it using a vintage wool blanket that I bought for £1 at the carboot in the Summer. It's not perfect, which at the moment is annoying me, but I'll get over it. Stitching through 4 layers of wool blanket to insert the piping was a difficult job. I like all of the textures; it's not the best of pictures because the light here has been very poor today.The conservatory drawers looked like this after their last paint job in  April 2014. They are oak and were rescued from my sister's cellar when she moved into the house in 1982Now they look like thisThey've had a paint job in shades of grey - not quite 50, though it felt like it when I was applying them!The hallway is almost finished now - we just have the pictures and mirrors to hang, which we're planning to do this weekend as we will be at home for the majority of it.The conservatory still needs a bit doing to it - I have to finish revamping the treadle, clean the room, pick up the throws I've ordered, and possibly make some new cushions. And all because I couldn't bear to part with a footstool I revamped!The materials to finish a couple of furniture renovations which are to be Christmas gifts will be bought tomorrow and then they can be completed. Once that's done I can start on a large sewing project that is also going to be a Christmas gift!The busyness continues, and I might be doing another Makers Market in a couple of weeks!"},

We'll be in the square near Armani.It started life looking like thisAnd now it looks like thisI'd been struggling with what to do with this stool, but after seeing that beautiful stag on Saturday night I was inspired, and this is my tribute to him.The legs had several coats of paint as I had originally painted them cream before I decided on the stag design.The checked fabric is part of a pure new wool vintage Marks and Spencer skirt I bought at a carboot during the summer. It was in immaculate condition, and I also have a Welsh wool skirt which I bought from the same seller who was obviously disposing of a relative's things.  The skirt lining was used in a bag I made this week. Nothing gets wasted here; I pride myself on using recycled materials as much as I can and using every possible scrap of them.I absolutely love it, and think it would be lovely in my conservatory, which is being given a revamp , but it would also be a thrill if somebody else liked it enough to want to buy it from us tomorrow - a few celebrities were spotted at the market last weekend so let's hope people will be there in force tomorrow, wanting to buy rather than browse for ideas!"},

I stumbled across one thanks to  not switching my phone from vibrate to ring a couple of weeks ago. Due to me not hearing my phone ring, I'd missed J at our meeting place and he had gone off to move the car to another free parking spot so I popped into a charity shop to keep warm.I found this plants stand for £3. It was damaged, but that didn't matter  as I didn't want the woven bits anyway.It was primed/ undercoated - I think I gave it 2 coats.Then it had 3 coats of Wilko's ivory tusk - those matchpots go a really long way. I've used 2 and a half so far on 4 footstools and this plantstand.It's turned out just as I hoped it would, making use of 2 of my Kathie Winkle plates - 'Rushstone' at the top and ' Romany' at the bottom. I used to have more of these but I had to sell them to help raise money for the new radiators 2 years ago. It's nice to have these where I can see them every day.Here it is in place next to the Ercol chair, which still hasn't been re-covered as I'm still busy stitching. This was my fingertips last week, and they're a whole lot worse now - on both hands, but I do have a lot of lovely items to show for it. Let's just hope somebody wants to buy them!"},
{"title": "No diagnosis, finishes and WIPs", "date": "Sunday 13 November 2016", "text": "My rheumatology appointment didn't bring me any answers as he still can't work out what is going on. Whilst I have all the symptoms of the thing he mentioned last time, I also have numerous other symptoms that don't fit that, but which fit other auto immune disorders for which blood tests have been negative. I seem to be a bit of a mystery, but I have form for that. The course of steroids has been extended, with the dosage reduction being more gradual and I'll take my last one on Christmas Day. My next appointment isn't for 2 months after that so it's a case of wait and see what happens when the steroids stop. He has reassured me that if things get too bad I can ring up for a prescription which will last until I see him again. It would be great to have a diagnosis after more than a year has passed, but for now I'm just grateful that I have some semblance of my life back and I intend to make the most of things until Christmas arrives. My opthalmology appointment has been postponed as the clinic has been cancelled. It doesn't surprise me as it fell between Christmas and New Year. I now have to wait another 3 weeks to see someone and hopefully find out what is wrong with my eyes which are permanently bloodshot and painful.I had my 3 monthly B12 injection this week. I hope it makes a difference as I have been stumbling around and have also had electric shock sensations in my hands and very odd sensations in my limbs. We'll see.Being able to sleep rather than waking each time I move in bed, being able to get out of bed in the mornings in a normal way rather than having to gradually roll out, and being able to walk around normally rather than being stiff and in pain means that I've actually been able to get up and get going which has been good on the crafting front. I finished this earlier this week.  It's made from pieces which were left over after making K's Christmas quilt 3 years ago.  The white around the edges is what was left over after piecing the sheets I bought at the carboot sale not long ago.It's all thrifted fabric - duvet covers, tablecloths, pillowcases, a laundry bag, napkins and sheeting and it's been hand quilted.I made this yesterday from some of the fabric which was very kindly sent to me by another blogger, and an old shirt of K's which I had kept because I liked the fabric ( part of it was used on a cushion I made for my bedroom a few years ago).I've also made a string of double sided bunting with 18 flags which bears K's business name ready for the stall at the end of the month.This is currently in progressIt's made from men's shirts which were bought for £1 each, a blouse of mine and a Cath Kidston pillowcase. It should be finished this week.Also in progress are two more cushion covers which are are being appliqued, and 4 pieces of furniture which are being painted.Like I said, I'm making the most of having some semblance of my life back."},

Just because it can't be seen doesn't mean that I don't make it look as good as possible. It was covered in cream damask.And this is the finished article. I'm very pleased with it!"},

I suspect that they'll consist of more photos than words but I figured that anything is better than nothing, so here's the first.******************I bought this firescreen at auction earlier this year. I was the only bidder. There were other firescreens in the auction which went for prices which were much too high for me. Those were undamaged whereas this one had a huge piece torn from the back of it.The front had a nice enough piece of embroidery in it, but it had water stains on it.I removed the glass, the picture and the back and was left with this on my kitchen floor......and the picture which was removed from its backing- it will be ' up-cycled' into something elseThe legs were also removed from the frame. I pinned doilies and pieces of vintage lace onto a piece of white pure cotton vintage sheeting, then hand stitched them to it, and I painted the frame and legs with 2 coats of undercoat/primer and 2 coats of emulsion paint in Wilko's 'Ivory Tusk'I then put it all back together, added a new back which was painted then fixed with panel pins and framing tape, and this was the result.I much prefer the updated version and I hope somebody else will like it too.It has been finished with some wax and will be on sale at the Makers' Market in Spinningfields at the end of the month."},

I don't know how long for, but I do know that where I'm concerned it isn't procrastination that's the thief of time, it's the internet.I'll be back when I've got lots of stuff done, with before and after pictures!"},
{"title": "Swanning around & changing things", "date": "Friday 30 September 2016", "text": "I spent an hour this morning finding the materials for, and making, this,It's made of a cross stitch picture that I paid 10p for at a carboot last year and some fabric that was in a book of samples I bought last year for £2. The back is made from old curtain linings. The total cost was around 30p.It just needs a gentle wash and a good press now. The cross stitch I used, and the other one, were languishing in a box of empty frames that were all being sold for 10p, so I rescued them. I'll take the other one out of the frame and make a cushion with that too at some point. The frames will be passed on to K, as she does amazing things with frames, wallpaper samples and a die cut machine.It took an hour, from walking upstairs to rummage through fabric, to photographing the finished article, and that included having to find a new needle for my machine half way through as I broke the other with a near miss on my finger. The tree fabric picks up the tree image on my key holder, which is handy; the key holder hangs under the stairs, which is where the cushion will be, in the Ercol chair. I finished the door curtains yesterday afternoon, other than hemming them. I've hung them to allow them to drop and will hem them next week. They turned out to be a fairly simple job in the end and we're both really pleased with how they look. I have enough fabric left to make the curtain to hide the gas meter, and to make the front of new covers for the Ercol chair. Somewhere upstairs I have a large piece of grey cord fabric, and a similar amount in a caramel colour, either of which could be used for the back of the covers.  I just need to find it as it wasn't with any of the fabric I looked through this morning :(It feels good to be creative again.Have a good weekend.*********************In the time it took me to write the above, hit publish and make a cup of coffee, I'd decided that I didn't like what I had just made. The tree fabric detracted from the cross stitch picture, despite the fact that it picked up some of the colour in it.Another trip to the attic threw up some much better fabric - another sample from the book- so I did some unpicking and restitching and now it looks like thisAnd, as you can see, I also found a piece of the tree fabric in a lovely silver colour, so I whipped up another cushion...... and they're going to sit in my Ercol chair together.I still haven't found either piece of cord fabric though!"},

I also used it without the long handle - hence the slattered hand.Aswell as painting I've been doing a few pretty bits. I saw this at a garden centre earlier this week and liked it, but not the £24.99 price tag ( the price is below the item) . I have a letter rack so don't need anything to store mail but did want somewhere for us to keep our keys far enough away from the front door so that nobody can steal them by fishing through the letterbox!I made my own version - a frame from Hobbycraft which was £4 as they're half price at the moment, a wallpaper sample and 3 hooks from a £1.99 pack of 6 .His and hers keys, or should that be hers and his?I've also made a start on this mirror. This is the before, but it's not quite finished yet so the after picture will come later. It was £3.50 at the car boot about 6 weeks ago and has been given a paint job. This one is for the hallway, close to the front door. I have a similar but rectangular shaped one bought at auction recently for £1 which is to hang at the top of the stairs. It will be given a paint job too.I've also made a start on revamping my letter rack as it was a teak coloured wood which won't fit in with the look I want.We've been to the allotment this afternoon. I picked some more beans, courgettes and raspberries, then we had lunch in the sunshine. I pruned some trees, then J took over and scalped them! To be honest one of them was pretty much dead and the other got plum leaf curl this year; they'll either grow again or they won't, and if they don't I'll grow clematis through them.I'll be busy next week working on the hallway, but hopefully will find some time and energy to blog. If not, you know where I'll be - getting spattered with paint, and then in the shower scrubbing it off before collapsing in a heap."},

{"title": "Cornerstones", "date": "Friday 19 August 2016", "text": "Not the house across the road from me which is named Cornerstones, or Ang's Norfolk home which has the same name, but cornerstones on my red,white and blue quilt.The patchwork items I've made in the past have just been squares stitched together with a border or two added, but this time I wanted to try something different by making blocks and adding sashing. It was going to be a disappearing 9 patch, but I couldn't face cutting the blocks up, rearranging them and stitching them back together; I am not an enthusiastic quilter. My first attempt at adding sashing was a disaster, and I was compromising because I really wanted cornerstones too. I remeasured, trimmed and tried again. It took me ages to get round to stitching the bits together because I kept putting it off, thinking it would be too difficult.Like most things, I'd built it up to be something much more complicated than it actually was, and this tutorial is helping to make doing this much easier.This is what it looked like in the early evening yesterday - I have stitched the blocks together into rows since then.Remeasuring and trimming paid off as every one of the seams of the sashing and cornerstones matches up beautifully.This is another  reason why progress has been so slow on this quilt, and why the blocks were laid out on my bed in the previous pictures, but he's going home this evening, so there can be no more excuses.......although the weather forecast is grim for the next few days so for the majority of the time I may be wielding a paintbrush in the hallway - just 7 doors and doorframes, all the skirting boards, the meter cupboard door and all the spindles on the staircase for me to paint as J hates painting woodwork and I quite enjoy it. Then it's over to him for the walls and ceilings and hanging all of the picture we have accumulated, whilst I sew new soft furnishings.I'm looking forward to it being finished - even more than my quilt!"},

All the jars have been washed and are now in use.The windbreak wasn't complete, but the metal poles will be brilliant for building a fruit cage at the allotment.This is the ' tapestry picture' which cost £1Nobody else appreciated this beautful piece of textile art as I was the only person to bid on it. I'm going to remove it from the frame and turn it into a large cushion.And the box of pictures for £1 contained the following 13 pictures 2 framed advertising prints for Lotus shoes and boots. They need fixing back into the frames but I like them very much and will be hanging them in the attic when it gets a makeover. A framed print of my hometown in bygone days, and a signed and numbered print showing Cragside and the Debden Burn . Both of these will be hung on the staircase wall once we have decorated the hallway. A cross stitch picture and 2 needlepoint/ tapestry pictures. These will be turned into cushions or bagsAn oil on canvas. This will also be hung in the hall once it's decorated as J really likes it.2 framed  Pears prints. These will be removed and the frames and mounts re-used by K 2 foil-art pictures. These will also be removed and the frames re-used by KAnd this one is already on the wall! It's a print of a street in my hometown circa 1924 and now hangs above our bed as it goes nicely with the old photographs which hang on the opposite wallThe £6 lot comprised the following 4 pictures 2 more needlepoint/tapestries. These will also be removed from the frames and upcycled into other itemsA huge print of a ship in a rather nice frame which will be reused and a tapestry/needlepoint of a cottage which will also be turned into something more usable.I also bought this stool and firescreen. Each of them cost £2 and will have a makeoverI was outbid on numerous other things, and some others opened with bids left on the book which were far higher than my budget. I was outbid on an immaculate vintage Singer electric sewing machine. It was gleaming, and looked like it had never been used. I still have the feeling that it is one that I let get away."},

These are from 1st July. The weather has been grim lately with lashing rain so we haven't been to the allotment as much as we would like.Courgette and mushroom omelette, garlic and herb homegrown potatoes and frozen peas- because the homegrown ones are so good they don't even make it through the front door! Courgette and chili soup - homegrown onion and courgette, 1 litre veg stock, a sprinkle of dried herbs and a sprinkle of chili flakes. It cooks in no time at all, is dirt cheap if you grow your own courgettes( why are they so expensive in the shops?), and is very tasty. I used to add blue cheese and omit the chili but we don't really eat cheese now.We'e been eating from the allotment and front garden - potatoes have been roasted with garlic and herbs or simply steamed, courgettes have been enjoyed in omelettes, have been roasted with other veg or turned into soup, and strawberries have been savoured as once ours are finished we won't eat another strawberry until ours produce next year. Salad leaves and spring onions have accompanied numerous meals, and peas haven't even made it into the house but have been enjoyed straight from the pod out in the garden.We did a lot of weeding last night so the plot is looking a lot tidier than it does on these photographs..... for now!"},

Underneath that was the original flowered quilted plastic cover which had been patched up with another piece of plastic which had children and animals on it. Now it has been covered in a piece of vintage barkcloth which was so kindly sent to me by L, a friend I've never met.I used the same barkcloth to recover the stool I've had for a few years.It looked like this when I originally bought itI recovered it in 2013 I liked it, but it had become grubby. The fabric was washed after I removed it, and it's been put back in the stash.Now it looks like this - fresh and very SummeryI've also revamped my ' Beyond the Nook' Scrabble tile pictureIt now has a red backgroundI just replaced the existing green fabric with some red rose card that I bought when I started my teacher training in 2006.This morning I found a red glass vase in the attic and filled it with flowers from the garden...   ... including a beautiful red roseI don't just have red things in the lounge.

Growing on in pots are leeks, courgettes and tomatoes.This was part of the back garden on a rainy day last weekend, and the wonderful clematis has started to flower againIt extends even further this year and is also climbing over the garage roof. Once it's in full flower I'll take some more photos . The flowers on the last photo are right outside the back door.And this was the allotment at the beginning of last week The rain which has been followed by some sunshine means that things have grown more, but the battery went on my phone when we were there on Sunday so I didn't get any photos. It won't be long before we are completely planted up - there are courgettes, sweetcorn and a few other things still to go in, as well as some more sowings of salad crops. Things are a tad higgledy piggledy this year as we didn't expect it to be sorted as quickly as it was, and we had to put the fruit bushes that we moved from the old allotment into any available piece of decent soil. It will be much more organised next year when the rhubarb, the whitecurrants and the rasberry canes have been moved to where we want them.We eat seasonally, so are very much looking forward to all the things that we haven't tasted since last Summer!"},
{"title": "Patriot games", "date": "Friday 20 May 2016", "text": "I started making a quilt months ago . I don't remember exactly when it was, but I know it was before October last year. I just put it away, undecided on what to do with it once I had made 16 of the blocks. I was going to make a disappearing 9 patch, but couldn't face cutting up the blocks that I'd just made, just to stitch them back together again- I'm not a naturally born quilter as I don't really have the patience or dexterity for anything too fiddly. Then I became ill and forgot all about it.Crumpled from being shoved in a bagI came across the final 4 unstitched blocks earlier this week and stitched them together. I laid it all out on the floor so that I didn't have 2 edges the same touching- or so I thought. Whilst adding the numbered and lettered labels I realised that I had stitched 2 of the blocks without the plain red square in the centre, and that I had some of the same edges touching. Less of a game, more of a chore, but as it's red, white and blue, I'm going to call this quilt Patriot Games.It will be getting some sashing between the blocks, and maybe some cornerstones - neither of which I've ever done before, but I think the sashing will set the blocks off nicely, aswell as increasing the size of the quilt top. I'm torn between white sashing and blue cornerstones, or red sashing and white cornerstones, so if you have an opinion on which you think would look best, I'd be glad to hear it! It's made of some fabric that was sent to me by a fellow blogger,  a small amount that was sent to me by L, my friend I've never met, my Mum's old gingham curtains, fabric leftover from making K's school dresses over 20 years ago, and some thrifted shirts.I have no idea what I will do with it, as it won't go with anything in my house - I just wanted to use  the lovely fabric that was so kindly sent to me. Maybe it will become the first thing in the pile of makes for sale - once I've shuffled those blocks round a bit.

They were perfect apart from the fact that they were ring topped, which would have looked odd in my bedroom. I bought them anyway, knowing that I could sort them out.I cut off the ring tops, and used a pillowcase which came in a black sack full of bedding bought from the charity shop for £3 more than two years ago...... to form a piece at the top to take the header tape.Having done that, and hung them at the window to check, they weren't quite long enough. Whilst annoying , it wasn't the end of the world. I just went up to the attic and found another piece of toning fabric and added that to the bottom.Difficult to get a good picture because of the light coming through the doors, but this is what they looked like from my bed this morningWe now have a lovely pair of curtains for the cost of a few pounds and a bit of stitching... and they look good with the patchwork bedspread I bought recently."},

It was bought from Wilko's and was cheap because it was a discontinued line. Fortunately for us it was perfect with the existing colour scheme in the lounge; the darker green in the paper picks up the colour of the rug, and both greens in the paper pick up some of the colours in the striped chair. The colour is actually a lot more zingy than it looks on these photos. I don't want to be stuck with the same wallpaper for years as, quite honestly, it would drive me mad. I prefer to look out for a bargain and enjoy it for a few years, before having a change.What it looked like when we completed it in 2012 - the total cost of renovation for the whole room then was £295, which included paint, wallpaper, lining paper, an Ercol chair, a stool, a wicker basket, fabric, tray, ornaments, mirrors, blinds, curtain pole, standard lamp, fire surround ( free from a neighbour) fire ( moved from another room in the house and the laminate flooring. Since then we have bought a brand new sofa ( 1 of 2 pieces which we have bought brand new in the last 15 years) and been given all the other furniture by my Mum. Our old sofas and dining table and chairs were donated to the British Heart Foundation. Smaller pieces of furniture are now utilised in other rooms in the house, and the TV unit which we originally bought for £1, has been dismantled and the wood used at the allotment.This is what it looked like when we moved in - minus the furniture of course- as this was the photograph on the estate agency detailsThe room feels much cosier now, and once we fit a carpet later in the year it will feel cosier still. I like the laminate flooring and it's still in good condition, but this is the coldest house that we have ever lived in, and the lounge is the coldest room in the house, so we're hoping that a carpet will help to warm it up a bit.And it's a huge improvement on what was here when we moved in!"},
{"title": "Re-use", "date": "Wednesday 4 May 2016", "text": "We do a lot of re-using here; it's not a new thing in our lives as we've been doing it for as long as I can remember; tomorrow we'll have been together for 35 years and married for 32 of those.When we removed the black carpet from KL's room we didn't throw it away. Part of it was cut off and transported to the allotment at the same time as the drawers and trunk that we moved down there. It's now on the floor of the shed, helping to keep it cosy on those chilly, rainy days that we've experienced recently.Another piece was cut to size and is now on the floor in the conservatory, covering up the cold ceramic tiles that were in there when we bought the house. Black isn't the ideal colour for in there, but most of it is covered by a large rug, so it doesn't matter.I've done more re-using this week. The bathroom was looking very much in need of freshening up after a very damp Winter. We always ventilate the room when we shower, there's an air brick in the wall and there's a radiator in there which is switched on, but we invariably end up with small spots of damp on the  2 outside walls. They've been scrubbed and all the walls and the ceiling have been re-painted. Unfortunately, my lovely laundry basket was also showing signs of damp so I had to remove the beautiful fabric that I covered it with last year. I was going to re-cover it using some grey fabric left over from making K's school pinafores about 22 years ago, but, typically, I couldn't find it just when I needed it. I had to find something else that went with the bathroom decor and found a piece of fabric that I cut off the bottom of a pair of curtains my Mum gave me for the lounge over 4 years ago. She gave me 2 pairs - 1 pair was perfect and the other pair was too long. As I have 4 curtains hung at the window I had to shorten one of the pairs. The fabric was just right with the colour scheme in the bathroom so the offcut, which I'd kept for over 4 years was re-used to cover the laundry basket.The last time we went to the allotment J re-used most of the bricks and blocks that he'd dug out of the allotment to form a path edging on 2 sides of the last rotational third that we sorted.I'm sure we'll be doing some more re-using whilst we're at the allotment tomorrow."},

It's entirely possible that I haven't done much more than that, apart from yet another visit to my GP. Most of the furniture has been moved around today, and J has stripped the wallpaper from the alcoves in the lounge. I did complete a very small revamp on Friday afternoon.My Mum had given me these jardinieres, along with a lot of other dolls' house stuff.They don't go with the look I want to achieve inside the house, so I revamped them to go on the outside.                                  A replica of my much loved childhood pet sits on the steps of the houseI used a pale grey first, and then added a darker grey over the top. The paint was from matchpots left over from painting things for the bathroom last year. I used children's paintbrushes ( £1 for a pack in Wilko's) to apply the paint.The wallpaper for the house has arrived, but I need to be in the mood to do that as it is going to be fiddly, particularly with my painful, and far from dextrous hands. I do have a bed and a few other bits for the house that I want to paint, so might do that this week, then everything will be done ready to be put in once I've wallpapered.Oh, and I bought another footstool yesterday, so that's another little project to keep me occupied."},

{"title": "Progress", "date": "Saturday 26 March 2016", "text": "As I mentioned recently, we have a new allotment. We moved in January to a smaller plot on a different site. The other one was just too large for us to cope with since getting rid of the car ( it will be 2 years next week) and because I'm struggling with my health.The new one is a bit closer to home. I used to work next door to it so am very familiar with it as I used to walk past it 5 days a week.We've visited on Sundays since we took it over, spending anything from 2 to 5 hours there. On Good Friday the weather was glorious and we were there from 11.15 until almost 6pm.Here are some photos that show our progress. Most of the hard work is J's , though I have worked at my own pace doing things that I've felt capable of on any given day - I have done a lot of painting, particularly the shed which needed so many coats of paint that I lost count, and I then painted the inside too! The left hand side photo was taken on 16th January which is the day we ' moved in', bringing everything from the old allotment including our small shed whch can be seen propped up against the fence. The right hand photo was taken on 25th March. It's not quite the same angle, but it's the nearest I've got. The fruit bushes and rhubarb crowns are in temporary positions. Again the left hand photo was taken on 16/1/2016 and the right hand on 25/3/2016. Two of the beds on the left have been converted into one larger bed, rubbish has been cleared, the shed has been erected, unwanted and rotting structures have been dismantled, the ' midden' has been emptied and dismantled and all the paths have been covered in weed suppressant and then covered in bark chippings. I did a lot of painting yesterday. The trunk and the drawer unit  were transported there strapped to a sack truck, and just as suspected we got a lot of strange looks. J constructed the bench from some of the bricks he has dug out of the soil, and half of an old table top that we took from the old allotment.The shed is starting to look as I had hoped. The trunk provides seating ( aswell as storage), along with a couple of old garden chairs that were given to us years ago. I painted the back wall and the inside of the door with the same wood paint I used on the exterior, and then painted the walls and ceiling in paint leftover from doing our kitchen, which I thinned with water. The cupboard on the wall is a bathroom cabinet which I bought when KL was a baby ( she will be 21 in the Summer). The curtain hides the ' facilities'. This shed is for cooking/ brewing up/sitting in. We share the large shed in the other pictures, and that houses the allotment paraphenalia. It will be renovated by J and our allotment neighbour once the weather improves enough for them to work on the roof.Just some of the rubbish that has been cleared/ dug out of the plot.I did a bit more ' prettying' yesterday. I filled the old sink given to us by our allotment neighbour, and planted some aubretia which was given to me by another plotholder - everyone we have met has been absolutely lovely. The old watering can without a spout that we brought from the old plot was given the same treatment.I brought primroses from the old plot. They originally came from around my great great grandfather's grave many, many years ago, and have been split and transplanted numerous times over the years. They look good underneath the fruit trees ( 2 plum and a pear we are told). I also put in a few primulas bought months ago for 30p yellow stickered at M'sons, and my hyacinths once they had finished flowering. I've planted some Summer flowering bulbs in this area too.We've still got lots to do to get it how we want it. Once the rubbish has been skipped ( a council skip will be delivered very soon) we can make more progress, but some of the onions and some broad beans are in, as are a couple of gooseberry bushes and a redcurrant, and the potatoes and blueberry bushes will follow soon. We'll get there, weather and health permitting!"},

It did not go to plan at first, then I reached the ' Why have I started this' stage, then I had a change of mind and now it feels a little like I am painting the Forth Bridge.I needed to find something else to occupy me whilst I was waiting the 3 days until we could go to town to buy the paint I needed in order to rescue the furniture.This laundry basket was dragged from the depths of the garage in order to become a bedside table for KL. I bought it in 2011 and paid £3 or £4 for it. I used to use it in the conservatory as shoe storage but it was moved out of there some time ago. I finished it this morning and here's a photo of the before and afterIt had several coats of white emulsion paint, and a wallpaper sample was cut to size and fitted under the newly cleaned glass. The flowers and leaves will tie in with those on the wallpaper in the bedroom, and the colours will pick up some of those in the quilt I made for her which is made of 1970s sheets and pillowcases.And the bargain? I found this at the local charity shop on Friday , and although I ummed and aahed about it, I am very glad that I saw sense and bought it as I absolutely love it.My dark red bedspread will be washed and put away for the Winter, as despite having looked at it on my bed for about 8 years, I still like it very much.I'll be back to furniture painting again tomorrow. I'll be so glad when it's finished, not only because I currently have doors and drawers in the hallway, more drawers in the kitchen and a roll of carpet in the lounge, but because everything seems to take me so much longer these days as I never know from one day to the next how fit I am going to be."},

The new covers have cost just pennies for the four.I cut the fabric on the fold, stitched around 2 sides with the machine, leaving the bottom of the cover open, turned it to the right side, placed the feather cushion inside, stitched up the bottom seam and attached a crocheted chair back by hand. Simple but effective, and a good use of the piece of fabric and chairbacks.Can you tell where J sits? I must smooth out the leather!I'm happy with how they look on the sofa - they tie in with the throw which is covered in vintage doilies.I've started a similar throw to use on my chair in the lounge, which will use up a piece of fabric, a fleece throw and some more doilies; I like turning clutter into useful things.

{"title": "Rough and stuff", "date": "Monday 13 April 2015", "text": "I decided today that I would check that I had enough doilies for my bedspread, and whether my idea of stitching them all together would look as I imagined it would. I can usually ' see' things, and knew how I imagined it would look, and how I wanted it to look.I sorted through most of the vast quantity of doilies and linen that I have accumulated, putting anything neutral coloured to one side.These were then laid out on our bed, with the tablecloth I want for the central panel placed first and the doilies added around it in a rough fashion.I bought a huge vintage tablecloth last week for 50p. It is damaged in a few areas, but is beautifully embroidered and has lots of crochet lace on it. This will be cut up to add to the doilies, and everything will be stitched to a vintage pure cotton white sheet which is the perfect size.I spent some time this afternoon knitting in the conservatory.  I started the cardigan yesterday and did a little bit of the back. It's taken from a booklet my MIL gave to me when I was expecting K in 1988.I finished the back this afternoon and started one of the fronts The lemon cardigan and bootees I knitted. I opted for plain things as I didn't know the gender, and much as I love the lacy matinee coat patterns that I knitted for the girls and my Mum knitted for me, I wasn't sure if they would be deemed ' old fashioned' these days A lacy blanket in mint green - this was J's favourite colour for our girlsKnitting is much harder going these days than it used to be as my fingers are stiff and very painful at times, but I do love doing it. Oh, how I wish that I had appreciated my youth when I was in the midst of it! This was my view as I sat knitting. I spent an hour or so in the back garden one afternoon last week. I filled a wheelie bin within that time as I removed so much dead foliage. I had a lovely afternoon; knitting, drinking steaming mugs of coffee, KL keeping me company in the other chair, and  singing along to songs from the 70s, including the soundtrack from Grease."},
{"title": "Not that different...", "date": "Wednesday 8 April 2015", "text": "Firstly, welcome to new followers via both Bloglovin and here. I hope you enjoy reading snippets of our life together in our little piece of Lancashire.Secondly, thankyou for all your comments on my last post about my latest linen haul and my plans for the bedspread. The idea is to piece all of the doilies/ pieces of linen together, attaching them to a vintage pure cotton white sheet ( also thrifted) as I go. This will then have some sort of filling ( cheap fleece blankets probably) and then be backed with another pure cotton vintage sheet ( thrifted again).The colour palette will be white/ cream/ beige; all neutral so that I can change the decor in the bedroom if I want to and it will still match.On to the kitchen, which we decorated last week while J was off. It doesn't look that different really, just new wallpaper in the same colourway of brown/ orange/cream, and there are a few things in the kitchen which weren't there last time I took photographs. Orange is a difficult colour to photograph - it either looks fluorescent or dark when I take photos of it, but as some readers had asked to see the kitchen when it was done, here are the best of a not very good bunch!The cupboards are at least 20 years old - we're still making the best ofthem, and will be for a few years yet.Everything was steam cleaned. The paint job on the cupboards is standing upwell to the rigours of everyday life in a very hard-working roomThe top of the mini-oven is not faring quite so well. KL took a metal scourer to it one day whilst I was out.Now if anything spills it leaves a stain. It's still functioning so it won't get replaced - just hidden by a tea-towelwhen it's not in use.The new wallpaper.Having a radiator in this room still makes me smile. I lived without one for 3.5 years, and in a room with 10' high walls and a tiled floor, it makes a huge difference to have one.I now have a lovely copper-coloured kettle. It was aChristmas gift from my Mum.J did a great job of covering the mark that was left after removing the very old, fluorescent light fittingMy Ercol dresser. I still love it, and the bits and pieces that stand on it- all of them second-hand and bought cheaply at car-boot sales and the odd charity shop buy. The brown and orange melamine coffee-pot on the right hand side was a recent birthday gift from K and A.The back door got a fresh coat of paint on Saturday. I did it, and the steam cleaning while J was at the allotment planting the first 7 rows of main-crop potatoes, which he'd transported there in crates tied to a sack trolley.A ' duck' egg holder. I bought this last year in my local charity shop for £2.50. It has replaced my amber glass chicken which has gone to live with K and A. The mustard colour of my Hornsea saffron collection is a perfect match to the new light fitting. Some of my collection had to be sacrificed to raise money for the new radiators. Better that than my wedding necklace though.My new toaster - also a Christmas gift from my Mum.It stands on my 30p Taunton Vale tray.The wallpaper picks up the poppies on this Meakin jug...... and this M&S tray. K has an identical one. When KL saw the photos of K's she said ' I'm sure Mum has one like that', to which K replied, ' Probably. It is orange and brown!'There's that M & S design again on the last of my placemats. I bought 8 or 9 for £1 at the carboot in 2011, but they too were sacrificed last year to pay for the radiators. I kept this one because it has a small chip.My ' new' clock which was passed to me by my Mum, as she replaced it with a turquoise one to match her latest colour scheme.So, that's it. Pretty much the same, but looking much cleaner and fresher for a coat of paint and some new wallpaper. The paint was left over from doing the kitchen last year, the wallpaper was bought at a reduced price with money made by selling some things on ebay, as was the magnolia paint for the ceiling - we bought a huge tub as it is the same colour that is in the hallway, which also needs freshening up.The light fitting was £2.99 at the charity shop.The kitchen will definitely not be to most people's taste. I can't imagine there are very many people these days who would choose to have an orange and brown kitchen, but that's fine because we all like different things, and it means that I can find brown and orange vintage treasures for pennies!"},
{"title": "Enough?", "date": "Monday 6 April 2015", "text": "I think I may now have enough items for my 'big project', which is a patchwork bedspread made from old doilies and linen.I struck lucky at the Tuesday carboot last week. I got up early and took myself off as I had a bus pass. The weather was dreadful - really windy, so there were fewer stalls and fewer people looking. I saw lots of old doilies on one stall, but the woman was rude and pushy ( two things I can't abide) so I left them, despite being told what a good price they were, and how she could sell them next week at a carboot in another town to one of her regular buyers. I headed off and came across a stall which had just a few things on it - some beautiful old chairs which I would have loved as I have a bit of a thing for chairs, and some other vintage bits and pieces. Piled up on the stall was what can only be described as a  'heap' of old linen. I asked for a price for the lot, was told ' a tenner love, I paid five for them last week', and told him I'd take them if he could hang on 5 minutes while I popped to the nearby cashpoint. I don't haggle when the price is fair ( more than fair in this case), as I think it's insulting, particularly when people are doing this to make their living.I got back to find he'd packed them all into 3 bags, had put in some fabric ( a piece of polyester and a piece of lining material) too and I happily paid my money.For that £10 I got 8 tablecloths of different varieties, but mostly featuring beautiful lace and crochet work, 2 linen napkins and 2 others, which match up with 2 of the tablecloths, a fabulous whitework laundry bag, 52 doilies/ traycloths, a piece of embroidery and a beaded jar/ jug cover.I washed them over the weekend, putting the delicate things into a tied pillowcase to do so, and here they are, drying outside on the line and racks.  Some of the detail on the tablecloth which will form the central piece of my bedspread. It's a bit crumpled with being washed, but it's really beautiful. There are 4 of the diamond pattern chair backs, so I'm going to turn them into new cushion covers for use on the sofa. I can use the polyester fabric that the man put in the bag and attach the chairbacks over it to make the fronts. Some of the detail on the laundry bag. I think it will go nicely in the bathroom when we revamp it - that's the next project, but I need to sell some things to fund the wallpaper first. The piece of embroidery - it measures around 18\" squareThe beaded jar/ jug coverA few of the things had tiny marks on them , but most have come off after being rubbed with Fairy soap ( 2 huge bars for 30p at the carboot 2 years ago!) before being put into a 40 degree wash with some ' oxy-action' stuff ( 99p a few weeks ago at Home Bargains - much cheaper than the top-brand equivalent)The bedspread is going to be a labour of love, and I'm planning on taking my time with it, so it could well be next year before it is finished.Meanwhile I have a baby bootee to make - this ball of wool seems never-ending as I have alredy got a cardigan and bootee out of it and I think there may be enough for a hat too. Baby was due yesterday, but hasn't made an appearnce yet."},
{"title": "Because he's worth it!", "date": "Friday 3 April 2015", "text": "I knitted this jumper for J when we lived at what we refer to as the old, old house.It was our first house purchase, and J moved into it in January 1984. We married in May and I moved in with him then. It's the home that we took K to after she was born in 1988.Anyway, back to the jumper. It was knitted sometime between May 1984 and January 1992, because that's when we left that house. It has had a lot of wear over the years, and despite the fact that it has gone a  bit ' bobbly' and developed a hole I kept it because I'd spent so long knitting it due to the cable pattern which runs up the front and along the sleeves.It is now miles too big for J, so I've decided to knit him a new one in charcoal grey - yes, I still have the pattern. I've bought the wool and I'll start it as a knitting project once I have finished the baby cardigan. I'll be able to pick it up and put it down when I want to and have it ready for the Autumn.This old navy blue one will still be worn though - probably by one of us when we are working at the allotment."},
{"title": "Worth the wait", "date": "Monday 30 March 2015", "text": "Worth waiting for - my mustard coloured 1960s/70s onion shaped glasslight fitting. It's a perfect match to the colour of my Hornsea Saffron pottery.When we moved here on 21st April 2011 there was a horrible fluorescent light fitting in the kitchen. It gave out really good light, but, like the rest of the kitchen we inherited, it was a bit grim. I cleaned it up as best as I could, and we've lived with it ever since, because I firmly believed that I would find something perfect someday which would go with our 1970s style kitchen.It was one of those things that is on the list that I carry round in my head and don't speak about for fear that I will jinx things and never find any of the things that are on it. A couple of months ago we took some stuff into the charity shop I use the most. J spotted something on a shelf - a vintage light fitting which he thought would be just perfect for the kitchen. How clever of him to know what was on the list n my head that I've never spoken of!We took it to the counter, and the elderly lady said ' You don't want to buy that do you ?' We insisted that we did, she looked at us like we were mad, we handed over the money and took it away.It cost us £2.99.It has been in a bag in the conservatory since then, waiting to be put up. I asked J on Friday if we could do some ' niggly' jobs this weekend and he agreed. One of my birthday gifts has been attached to the wall in the conservatory, and the light fitting has been put up. The weather was too bad to put another of my birthday gifts up outside.We will be redecorating the kitchen this week as J finished at lunchtime today and doesn't go back until next Tuesday. The ceiling will be painted, the walls will get a fresh coat of orange as I have plenty left from last time, and the cupboards will have a fresh coat of white; again I have paint leftover. Things will be steam cleaned, the wallpaper will be stripped and new wallpaper will be hung. I do love the current wallpaper, but some cold winters, having no heating in there until the end of last year and the fact that it's a hard-working room have played havoc with it and it now looks a bit grim in places. I managed to find some paper in the right colourway and bought it a couple of months ago after selling some things on ebay to fund it. I need to get some paint for the ceiling, but I sold another lot on ebay yesterday which will more than cover the cost of the paint, so it will be a free kitchen spruce up, other than the £2.99 we paid for the light fitting."},

I'd treated myself to a weekly bus ticket as I had a lot of parcels to post and I really didn't fancy carrying them all to the post office in the wind and rain.  The ticket had a lot of use Anyway, because I had the pass I decided that if I woke up in time I would get the 8.35 bus into town. The carboot was quite busy when I got there just before 9am. I bought a make-up bag still with the tags on for 20p, a bag for the Summer for 30p, a book for my Mum for 10p and a glass sugar bowl for me for 10p. I wandered round and came close to buying some vintage linens, but they weren't exactly what I was after for a big project I have in mind. I walked further on, and looking at the ground as I always do, I spotted in the gloom, a carrier bag with what looked like vintage doilies in it.I bent down, had a quick look inside and asked the trader how much they were. He gave me a price for the lot of £5. I didn't have that much on me, so he settled for £4.This is what was in the bag - 40 beautiful vintage doilies for £4, hence the blog title of 40 for 4. Most of them are destined for ' the big project', and some for a smaller project; those I don't want will be sold.I've almost finished the baby blanket that I've been knitting for K and A's best friends. The baby is due on Easter Sunday. I've decided to wait to make the quilt until I know the gender of the baby. It seems to be very rare these days for parents not to have asked the gender beforehand, but they haven't.That leaves me a couple of weeks to do the smaller project that involves the doilies, unless the baby comes early!"},
{"title": "Getting ready for it...", "date": "Sunday 22 March 2015", "text": "We had a really busy day yesterday, helping K and A move into their new home.Let's just say that, amongst other issues, the house hadn't been left in the way it should have been by the vendors, and I spent much of the day scrubbing out a filthy kitchen and cupboards in other rooms, along with shifting furniture and unpacking boxes.We got home at 11.10 p.m, having walked the 2.2 miles from the railway station as that was preferable to hanging around in the cold waiting for a bus.That was a good decision as we were most of the way home before the bus passed us.It was late when we went to bed as we both felt the need to ' come down' a bit, and we needed a cuppa and a couple of painkillers to deal with the aching joints.I thought I would have slept in, but I was awake just after 7am and the washing was on the line in the sunshine just after 8am.J didn't wake until 10am; he had done a lot of lifting and shifting yesterday, on top of doing the 5k Parkrun yesterday morning, and cycling there and back to do it ( that totals around 5 miles).We'd decided on a pottering kind of day after yesterday's strenuous activity, and the weather today has been glorious. We've eaten lunch and drunk copious cups of tea and coffee in the front gardenJ has planted potatoes, moved strawberry plants and planted lots of seeds in the greenhouse.I decided to Spring clean the conservatory, as Bold has used that as ' his room' for the past 10 days.The windows, frames, and floor have all been washed. Everything has been vacuumed. The chairs have been taken outside, dusted and polished. All the cushions from the chairs have been vacuumed and left outside in the sunshine for a few hours. Soft furnishings have been cleaned.Furniture and ornaments that were removed for Bold's arrival have all been cleaned and put back, and now we're ready for more lovely weather so that we can sit in there, feel some warmth in our increasingly painful bones and relax for a while.Here are the photos I took once it was all finished and everything was back in there.Full of secondhand stuff!Our vintage chairs ( bought secondhand in the 1990s for £30 the pair) which I recovered almost 4 years ago in a patchwork design. The covers have faded now, but I still love them. The chairs recline through 3 positions to lie flat and are incredibly comfortable.Cushion covers and blankets from carboot sales and charity shops and my Dad's 1970s bureau which has had several ' new looks' since it was passed to me in the 1990s. A treasured gift - the happily ever after sign was sent to me by a friend I've never met as she said she thought it was appropriate for me and J. For someone else to recognise the love that we share was incredibly touching. Thanks L xxBits and pieces that I've accumulated over the years. The trinket pots were 18th birthday gifts. The vase was 50p from a charity shop in Southport on a day out there about 7 years ago, the wooden pot with the metal handle on the lid cost 30p at the carboot, and the other wooden pot was made by a friend's husband, along with the sycamore dish which stands on top of the bureau - both items were gifted to me. The wooden lamp base was 50p at the carboot and the shade 10p.Picture - handmade by me and put into a 50p charity shop frame, the sycamore bowl, a lignum vitae urn which cost £1 at a charity furniture warehouse, M&S planter 30p carboot, ' Trespassers will be composted' sign - a gift from K and A, Christmas cactus - rescued from Homebase a few years ago for 25p - it flowered last year for the first time, ' Make do and mend' hanging heart - one of my recent birthday gifts.My treadle machine which was bought locally, my ' hall chair' which came from the charity shop for a few pounds ( I can't remember if it was £3 or £5) and my sewing box which came from the Sunday carboot for £5 and which was full of vintage buttons when I bought it! Another wooden bowl - 10p at the carboot, the bear is one of K's childhood treasures, and both giraffes were gifts from K and A.Now, if we could just have a sunny day tomorrow, and I could relax in there with my knitting and recover from yesterday's exertions, I would be very pleased indeed!"},

The brown and the cream were bought from a charity shop a few months ago, and cost £4 or £5. There's a grain of sand in the camera which makes it look as if one of the grey squares is a slightly different colour! Knitted in simple garter stitch, because of the nature of the mohair yarn, the squares were mattress stitched together into rows, and then the rows blanket stitched to one another It was all then attached to a cheap fleece blanket ( 2 for £3.99 from B and M) by blanket stitching, and anchored with a couple of stitches at the corner of each suare.  Badger - I used toy filling ( bought for 50p at the Sunday carboot in 2012) and a bag of S'bury's Basics rice to stuff him. He is now nicely weighted so that he can be utilised as a doorstop.I just hope Bold doesn't attack him! K loved him; she was a huge fan of Farthing Wood when she was a little girl, which is why our gorgeous grand-kitty is called Bold. Bought in a charity shop in 2011. Someone had started to make it and given up, which isn't surprising as each piece that they had attached was incorrect and had to be unpicked.The gifts didn't cost much in the way of materials, but took quite a lot of time - luckily I have plenty of that, particularly when I step away from the internet.Now, I must get on with knitting a baby blanket because after that I have a play quilt to make; the baby is due in 5 weeks."},

I hope that never happens; I love those trees and they are protected as they stand in the conservation area. One had to be felled due to disease the year before we moved in and the house at the back had to get permission to do so.This morning we had wintry showers, but by this afternoon we had sunshine so I headed out for a walk to my Mum's, depositing 20 more items at the charity shop en route. I try very hard not to look at the things on the shelves as I head to the back room with my donations, but I did see a lovely teaset today. I didn't succumb to temptation though!I also gave my Mum a CD that I knew she would like, and the Mary Higgins Clark book which I bought at the carboot on Sunday. I've read and enjoyed it, and I've started the other one; I'm  93 pages in and enjoying that too. Definitely 20p well spent. I've been eyeing up some of the books on KL's bookshelf , and whilst rummaging in the attic I have come across a few of mine that have remained  unread along with some that are worth reading again. I seem to have plenty to keep me going for a while.Here are today's views  The birds have been busy - the feeder is almost ready for filling againThe front garden is the emptiest it has been for a long time, though the onions that J planted to overwinter are doing really well. The soil is looking decidedly sticky after all the rain we have had and we don't have many leeks left in the ground now.I'm going to have an hour with my book and Smooth radio now. I love the fact that I can sing along with almost every song they play. I'm not sure J would agree - my singing isn't very good!"},
{"title": "Finished in time", "date": "Monday 29 December 2014", "text": "The quilts I made were finished in time.The one I made for K and A was a very last minute decision, as I realised that the other thing that I had started to make them would definitely not be finished in time. Fingers crossed they will soon have a new home so it can be a house-warming gift for them.This is KL's, made for her room at home, and now keeping her warm as the temperatures dip.It's made with brick-shaped pieces, all handcut using a template and a pair of scissorsThese were edged with a plain pink border, then a border made from smaller brick shapes, and a final pink border which I folded over to use as a binding.All of the fabric is used; thrifted sheets, duvet covers and pillowcases, and one of K's old skirts is in there aswell. The quilt top was attached to a fleece which KL used on her bed at the old house.I'd cut a lot of brick shapes, far more than I needed for KL's quilt, which was fortuitous as I could use them to make a quilt for K and A. It will go perfectly in their new dining room as their soft furnishings are made from vintage fabrics, and the 'Big Brother' chair which we gifted to them ( it's an original 1960s swivel chair that we have had for a number of years and is an identical shape to the chair used in the first UK series of ' Big Brother') is currently upholstered in vintage sheeting. It's much smaller than KL's quilt, but is intended to be used as a throw The wadding is an airline fleece blanket that I bought in a charity shop for 50p, and the backing is vintage sheeting, which was also charity shopped. Hand embroidered labels were added to each quilt, and both quilts were hand stitched in the ditch.That completes my crafted presents for Christmas 2014 - a teacosy for my Mum, a cat bed for Bold and 2 quilts.I know absolutely nothing about quilting and just make it all up as I go along, using common sense and what I was taught at school 35 years ago, so if you're a quilter you'll no doubt be able to see all kinds of things wrong with them.They are made with oodles of love though, and I like the thought that I'm making things from fabric that was unwanted, or was worn, just like generations of people before me.I'm back to crafting already, despite the scarred fingers and the cut on one fingertip ( I slipped with a knife on Saturday), as I still have K and A's original gift to finish!"},

{"title": "Chaos...", "date": "Monday 22 December 2014", "text": "... seems to be the order of the last few days here at Beyond The Nook.KL's present still isn't finished, though I did manage to hand-quilt and bind K and A's quilt yesterday, embroider the label and attach it, so that is ready to be wrapped.I alo made a teacosy for my Mum. The stripey fabric is a thrifted pillowcase, the lining is part of a thrifted sheet, the 'wadding' is part of a thrifted fleece blanket, and the thick lining is part of a piece of thrifted woollen fabric. I just quilted it along all the stripes and I'm really happy with how it turned out. It will match the stripey tiles in her kitchen perfectly!K contacted me yesterday to ask if she and A could come for Christmas, which was a lovely surprise, and I'm so looking forward to seeing them, but it seems to have sent me into a tailspin for no apparent reason.I was out before 8am today as I had to go to my Mum's to help her with the new furniture that was being delivered, and that took longer to sort than expected.Then, at lunchtime we received letters from the Student Finance Company dated 9th December, asking for evidence of our income for the year ending 2013 to be sent to them within 21 days as part of a random sample ( we weren't asked to provide evidence when we completed the application more than 6 months ago). I have contacted them to point out that 13 days have already elapsed since the letter was printed, and that it is almost Christmas. I managed to find J's P60 without too much trouble, but I now have to go to the library to photocopy it, write a letter to say that I had no income that year, and get it in the post, as the letters we received stated that without the evidence KL's finance could be reduced. The lady on the other end of the phone claimed this was just to give people a shove into sending things rather than putting it off, but quite honestly I don't want to take any chances.I could just do without having to mess about with this.KL's out at the moment having another tattoo ( this is number 5), so I've had peace and quiet for a little while. I've wrapped some presents, and attempted to machine the binding on her quilt, but it looked awful, so I've had to unpick it which means that  I'll be shut away in my bedroom for a few hours tonight hand stitching that ( an probably tomorrow night too)When she gets back we're going to the library to photocopy the P60, then Asda for a few bits (chicken for K and A and a plant for J's Mum, as he's decided at the last minute that he is going to get her something), and then to my Mum's to deliver her gifts. I like her to have them ready to open on Christmas morning.It all just feels chaotic; my own fault in part for not coming up with ideas for gifts soon enough, but I can't force creativity. Tomorrow is earmarked for cleaning and tidying, as the state of the house is making me feel on edge; the lounge looked like a sewing room yesterday and isn't much better today as I can't get into the attic to sew up there because it's full of furniture and boxes. On Christmas Eve I'll be  baking with KL before J finishes work, and K and A arrive.Does anyone else feel like everything is chaotic, or is everything calm at your house?Please tell me it's not just me!!I don't feel like my normally relaxed self today, more like the anxious, edgy person I used to be, and I really don't like it.I need to breathe and count to 10."},

When I see it like this it's hard to think what a magnificent sight it will be in 6 months time.  Looking bare now as lots of the plants have disappeared until the weather warms up again in Spring It's very drab out there, and so very different from the jungle like secret garden that we enjoy so much in the SummerThat's outside, now inside.The new sofa arrived this morning so here are some photos of what the room looks like nowI'm looking forward to J arriving home from work so that he can see it.We feel very lucky, are really happy and couldn't ask for anything more."},

She wasn't due home until tomorrow, but is unwell so has come home today. At least she has a freshly decorated bedroom rather than the one which was looking distinctly tired and shabby after 3 years of use.As always, this room makeover has been done on a tight budget. The only thing which has been bought brand-new is the wallpaper, and I bought that in April of this year when there was one third off the price of all wallpaper in Wilkos. It cost £8 per roll and took 2 rolls. Almost everything else in the room has come from the garage or the attic, or has been passed on to me by my Mum. The exceptions are the small book shelf which I bought at the Saturday carboot last week for £1, and 3 matchpots of paint from Asda.The photos haven't come out that well as the light has been terrible here today, and I had to take them quickly as KL was due home.The makeover has come in at just over £33."},
{"title": "Under strict instructions", "date": "Wednesday 15 October 2014", "text": "I was under strict instructions to have an easy day yesterday. I've had chest pains intermittently for the last few days (I've got them again today) so I've probably been doing too much; either that or I'm in for another rough patch. I sincerely hope that I'm not, as I have plans to strip the wallpaper then paint KL's room this week so that J can hang the new wallpaper at the weekend.I promised J that I would take it easy, and decided to do some sewing for KL's room. She's having a complete change of colour scheme and look, so everything needs to be replaced.Once it's done I'll do a ' ta-da' post with all the costings, but as ever, it is being done with not much money and a lot of imagination.I've only managed to source one ' new' double duvet set in the right colourway and style. It's a vintage Marks and Spencer one that I picked up for not much money, somewhere or other. I'm usually very good at remembering where I got things, but that one escapes me, which means it may well have come in a large bag of vintage bedding I got for £3 from a charity shop which saves them for me as nobody else wants them. That left me short of a duvet set in the right colourway and style.What I did have was a vintage Plumbs' single duvet cover with a side opening. As you can see from the label, it cost me £1.25; I bought it in May/June 2013.I opened the duvet cover up by unpicking the seams; that gave me one large piece of fabric. I then took the back off one of the white duvet covers KL has been using since we last did her room 3 years ago ( it's a pure cotton one which was bought for £3 at a charity shop and which is now looking well used). I attached the vintage fabric to the cotton to make a double size cover.Here it is, finished and laid out on our king sized bedI reused the old buttons, and made some new buttonholes, and I now have a lovely duvet cover in the right size and the perfect colours and pattern.There was some of the vintage fabric left so I  used that along with part of the front of the white duvet cover  and some ribbon from my stash ( thanks M- the green was perfect for this project) to make 2 pillowcases. I still have a small piece of the vintage fabric which will probably be used for something else within the room.I'm really happy with how they have turned out, and J's happy that I did as he asked and took it easy all day.I'm having another easy day today, so I'll probably be making new cushion covers for her room.*******************Many thanks for the well wishes for K and A's house purchase, and welcome to new followers via Bloglovin and on here."},

This gives you some idea of how dark my kitchen is.It's still looking very green considering it's nearly the end of SeptemberThe leaves are falling off the Virginia creeper now The sweetcorn have been harvested and the plants removed.The tomatoes are still ripening. I harvested a colander full earlier this week  Still looking wild and woolly in the back garden. It's hard to believe that in a few months the garden will be almost completely bare, as all the perenniels will disappear until next SpringThose slabs are still there!I've finally crafted something - even if it is just a cushion and lavender bagsfor KL's room in her new house. I found some of this daisy bedding at a charity shop last year for £2.50, and bought it because I thought it would be lovely for crafting with. KL had other ideas! She really loved it, used it on her bed at uni last year, and it's the bedding she chose to put on her bed when we arrived at her new place last Saturday. Earlier this year I found a single duvet cover and  frilled pillowcase in exactly the same fabric - I paid just £1.25 for them at a local charity shop. It is Debenhams bedding and every piece I've found has been in lovely condition. I unpicked the frilled pillowcase, cut some of it into strips for the front of the cushion,made the back in a simple envelope fashion from mismatched pieces, and used part of the frill to make the piping.Some of the offcuts were used to make  the very simple lavender bags to hang in her wardrobe at her new place.These are the first things I've sewn for absolutely ages, and I used my carfree gift to myself - a new electric sewing machine. It was bought online from Hobbycraft, £69 with free delivery and 10.1% back through Topcashback. I last bought a brand new sewing machine in 1992,which also happened to be a Brother, and needed this as that one gave up the ghost almost 2 years ago, and my old electric Singer, which K found at a carboot sale, and which I've used for almost 2 years, has developed a mind of its own - it runs as soon as it is switched on at the plug - terrifying the first time it happened, as it had been running normally. I'd gone downstairs to make J's lunch and a few minutes later I heard the sewing machine start running in the attic room. Seeing it running on its own was like something from a spooky film!This new one is a cheap and cheerful model, it has good reviews, and is good enough for the sewing that I do.  There were no fancy functions on the machines I used at school, hence me learning to do everything by hand for my 'O' level; in fact I still make most of my buttonholes by hand!"},
{"title": "A mixed bag...", "date": "Wednesday 6 August 2014", "text": "A mixed bag of a post today.I finished making myself a bag this morning. I needed one that was large enough to pop parcels in, which had pockets to hold my phone and my keys, and which was comfortable to use, so I made my own.I used some of the £1.49 charity shop piece of corduruoy that I bought a couple of years ago, part of which I used to make this cushion earlier this year.Vintage buttonsPiped seamsI lined it with part of a vintage duvet cover which was previously used to line my oldpatchwork kitchen curtains. I washed the curtains when I took them down to decorate thekitchen, so I just unpicked the fabric and reused it.Frugal living continues to be the norm here at Beyond the Nook.The garden produce is being incorporated into most meals.Yesterday's lunch was mushrooms on toasted homemade bread served with salad. The salad contained homegrown lettuce, Spring onions and peas, with shopbought British tomatoes as ours aren't ready yet.Tea was penne pasta served with a bolognese type sauce. The sauce was made with 100g of soya mince(37p), courgettes and onions from the garden, 100g of mushrooms(35p), a tin of tomatoes(25p) a sprinkle of basics dried herbs, a squirt of tomato puree, and a teaspoon of Marmite ( approx. 20p for the lot) and the pasta was 30p.I made plenty, so we had smaller portions for tea today with garden salad and some garlic bread that I made with pizza dough I had frozen last time I made some.     £1.47 for the pasta bolognese and approximately 30p for the garlic bread, so that's 6 main meal portions for around 30p each.Further frugal news with the washing powder. I always mark the box with the date that I open it and decant half into my ' washpowder tin' along with a bag of soda crystals.The latest box was opened on 15th June. Half a box of powder and a bag of soda crystals have lasted from then until yesterday, when I emptied the remaining half a box and another bag of soda crystals into my tin. If this lasts as long as the other half I'll have got 14 weeks worth of washing out of the box. The powder costs £2.52 and 2 bags of soda crystals cost £1.38. That works out at just under 28p per week for washing powder. I know some people make their own laundry liquid, but I don't want to; this is what works for me.Our beautiful boy is arriving tomorrow for a 3 week holiday with us, while his Mum and Dad go off to sunnier climes for their well-deserved holiday, so I'm hoping that there will be cuddles aplenty; I always feel very honoured when he comes to sit on my lap for a cuddle."},
{"title": "Birthday presents", "date": "Tuesday 22 July 2014", "text": "On 11th July my ' big girl' celebrated her 26th birthday.It's difficult to believe that it is that long since I first looked into the beautiful eyes that are so much like her Daddy's.I made two of her birthday gifts and the other was something I found at a carboot sale many months ago. That's the way things go here; handmade, homemade, and thrifted gifts are the norm.I decided to make her some bags; a strong one for work for her to carry her marking in ( she teaches English in a high school), and a beach bag for her well-deserved 3 week holiday in the sun next month. They were made on the weekend before her birthday and posted a couple of days later.The strong one for work Made from part of a thrifted piece of denim fabric ( a huge piece for £1, carboot 2013) and a thrifted pillowcase ( 50p charity shop St Annes 2013) Bound edges  I made it so that it's reversible  Beach bag.Made from part of a piece of absolutely beautiful fabric which was so generously sent to meby the lovely Gigibird, and lined with part of an old shower curtain Simple tie fastening The shower curtain must be around 6 years old. It was in great conditionapart from an inch or so around the bottom so I saved it.I knew it would come in for something - eventually!The thrifted item was a carved wooden turtle, which I forgot to photograph before I posted it to her.She loves turtles, and they formed part of the theme for the wedding last year. K made signs for both the room A was getting ready in, and for their room, which she used.Their amazing cake topper - K and A riding on a turtle. K sent photographs of her dress and A's suit to the lady who made itso that she could replicate them.Even  Bold, our beautiful grandkitty, was included! Handmade by K, as were so many of the things at the weddingShe loved her presents, which is the most important thingThe total spend including postage - less than £5.The amount of thought and love that went into things - priceless."},
{"title": "52 Projects number 26... Spruce up the shower room", "date": "Sunday 29 June 2014", "text": "Anyone who has been reading my blogging efforts for a long time will know all about 'the shower of doom'.We don't have a bathtub here at Beyond the Nook. The fact that the house only has a shower room was just one of the reasons I dismissed the property numerous times in our search for a new home. The fact that the room had a mouldy carpet, a window that was stuck closed and dripping taps ( you get the picture) just added to my woes, as they were just more things to add to the verrrrrry long list of things to be sorted.It did however have fairly expensive tiling on the walls, and an all singing all dancing shower cubicle, so we decided to make the best of it.J laid some laminate flooring, and within days, the shower leaked underneath due to some shoddy plumbing and the flooring was ruined, hence it being named the 'shower of doom'.That was fixed, new flooring was laid, new taps were fitted, wallpaper was hung, painting was done and pipework was boxed in.Anyway, we've been making the best of it ever since. The room has a tilt and turn window, which isn't the best thing for ventilation, and despite the room also having an airvent, it gets a bit mouldy on the outside walls.It was time for a spruce up, so I scrubbed the affected areas and painted them with damp seal. The following day I attached a small roller to a broom handle, taped it in place, and painted the walls and ceiling in less than half an hour.It immediately looked a lot better.Yesterday I gave everything a really good scrub, swapped some things around, put some sweet peas from the garden into a vase, and everything looks even better.It's a small room, but has a good sized window in it so is really light.I'm guessing this has come out dark because the camera was pointed towards the light source.The tealight holder came from the living room, the plant holder from the garage.I had the ' Relax' sign at the old house, aswell as the green vase andthe white pottery jarThe painted area had mould spots. Now it looks clean again.The mirror was in the attic room when we moved in, and this is the towel rail that was here.Both seemed to ' go' in the room so we used them.Green glass picked up for pennies at the carboot. Sweet peas from the front garden.I bought the cupboards when I started uni in 2006. I stored text books etc in them in the conservatory at the old house. They were then moved to the attic room there, then into the attic room here, and finally intothe shower room.Nice clean walls and the shower of doom. It has 2 different shower heads as well as massage jets, a seat, and a mirror!We do now have a bathtub and tiles in the garage, just waiting for us to decide when to start renovating. It's going to be a messy job - the nice tiles have been fixed on top of some very old ones ( we found the evidence when sorting out the leak from the shower), so that's 2 layers of tiles to remove, plumbing to alter, a bath to fit, tiling to do, new flooring to be fitted, wallpapering and painting to be done.If I forget about wanting a bath so much ( it's been over 3 years since I've had a soak in a bath), this room isn't bad at all now it's been freshened up.Total cost for the spruce up ?Nothing, as I already had the paint in the garage."},
{"title": "Almost as good as new...", "date": "Saturday 14 June 2014", "text": "Cushion covers washed, body scrubbed (hence the darker patches on the arms - it's not quite dry yet!) The large, green, patterned cushions at the back  were gold when I bought the suite, but I made new covers when we moved here and changed the colour-schemeI bought my suite - 2 x 2 seater sofas and a large matching footstool- on 14th August 2006. I bought it on ebay and paid £140. I then paid £21 to hire a van to transport it in, so the total cost to me was £161. I didn't think I was going to get it as the seller put a reserve on it quite late on and my bid didn't reach it. Apparently there were lots of people watching it, but I was the only bidder. The seller contacted me and told me I could have it for the amount that I had bid, and a few days later I collected it. The seller was a headteacher at a fairly local school. He had bought it from DFS on a '1 year free credit and then 3 years to pay' offer. He had just finished paying for it, so it was 4 years old when I got it. Now it's almost 12.It was looking a bit grubby so yesterday I removed all the cushion covers and put them through a 30 degree wash and then pegged them on the line to dry in the sunshine. Today I've scrubbed the body of the suite using a nailbrush and some Stardrops in warm water.It's all been put back together now, and looks almost as good as new. I once read a blog post in which the writer sneered at DFS suites, but mine is still going strong after 12 years, even though I bought  it secondhand.One thing's for sure - I've definitely had my money's worth out of it."},
{"title": "Welcome, and 52 Projects 22,23, 24 and 25 ... Kitchen revamp", "date": "Tuesday 10 June 2014", "text": "Welcome to my new followers, both via Bloglovin and on here - there seem to be a few more than there was last time I looked, so I hope you enjoy what you see.The kitchen has been in need of a revamp for a while now. The renovation on a £220 shoestring was completed in March 2012, and it is a very hardworking, room - photographs of what we inherited, and what we initially did with it, can be found on the ' Previously Finished Articles' page at the top of the blog.I painted all the cupboards and the back door at the beginning of last month ( no. 22), just before we went on holiday; I didn't change the colour of them and just kept them white. Really, I want sleek, glossy white units, but I'm stuck with the ones I inherited when I moved in, and just have to make the best of them, despite the fact that they are at least 20 years old.Whilst the outside of the cupboards looked much better for a fresh coat of paint, the insides looked just as bad when I opened the doors. When we were charity shopping in Plymouth ( doesn't everyone charity shop while they are on holiday?), I found something that has been on ' the list' for a very long time. I'd given up hope of finding any, but there it was on the bric-a brac shelf - the shelf that had a sign saying ' 4 items for £1'.3 rolls of vintage sticky back plastic - the answer to my cupboard woes!Vintage sticky back plastic - it reminds me of the stuff that myMum used as kitchen wallpaper for my homemade Sindy kitchen in the 1970sThe bottom shelves of the cupboards have been covered in it, as have all the cupboard and shelf edges. They all look so much better, and now I smile when I open my cupboards. The upper shelves have been re-lined with leftover wallpaper, because I didn't want to waste my precious sticky back plastic on things that can't be seen. That's number 23 crossed off the list.The revamp hasn't stopped there. I was sick of the 3 magnolia walls and wanted more colour. I wanted to keep the wallpaper that I have on one wall because I love it, so I chose to paint the walls orange - it's ' Jelly Bean' by Wilkos. It has made such a difference to the kitchen; now the cupboards stand out against the orange, as do the white frames of the pictures on the wall. Painting the walls is number 24.The cupboards stand out much better against the orangeWhere all my cooking is done - a mini oven with 2 rings on itI was thrilled when the lady in the hospice shop showed methis tablecloth - I knew it would be perfect for new curtainsThe window I take some of my Thursday view photographs through.The tray was 30p from the Sunday carboot months ago. It's perfect with theorange walls.I no longer have a microwave, so I have a bit more worktop space.The breadmaker I bought in 2000 finally gave up earlier this year. This one was bought at the Sunday carboot in 2011/12 for £2.50 and stored away.Some of my Hornsea ' Saffron' pottery and my 3 chicken ' egg holders' sit ontop of the cupbaoardsThe orange is perfect with the flowers in the wallpaperNot quite the glossy white units that I had in mind when we moved in. The kitchen unitbudget was eaten up by the need for a new front door and glass panels to the side of it -those that were on the house were a burglar's dream!We added new handles to the cupboards a while ago and I bought glass ' worktop savers'after discovering that glossy white worktops show every little scratch!Orange tablecloth and brown geometric duvet cover combined to makenew curtains!The pelmet was made from offcuts of tablecloth, part of a damaged damasktablecloth and some ribbon that was sent to me by a blogfriend - thanks M -the colours are perfect!I bought this lamp at the carboot in Bodmin last month - I paid £2 for it.The tureens are Sunday carboot finds from 2011/12 - I paid £1 for each of them.I broke the lid of the Meakin poppies one last week so now I'm using it to keep onions in.The other is  Midwinter Stylecraft ' Rosewood'I've also used some fabric that the lovely ladies at the hospice shop saved for me  to make new curtains to hide the washing machine and the shelves underneath the oven, and I've also made a pelmet for the window with the bits that were left , and part of a white damask tablecloth that was damaged. I used a tablecloth for the front of the curtains and part of a duvet cover for the lining. Making new curtains is the 25th thing crossed off the list.  I can count on the fingers of one hand the number of times I closed the curtains that I had up at the window and on the door, so I'm not going to have curtains now. Anyway, it means that it's one less place for the spiders to hide - I have never lived in a house that has as many spiders and cobwebs as this one does-  I moved 10 spiders while I was decorating the kitchen. Apart from the painting,and revamping the cupboard interiors that I did last week, I've given everything a thorough Spring clean, albeit a little late. I'm happy with it, J and KL like it too, and apart from the £1 I recently paid for the sticky back plastic ( I still have 1 roll left) all it has cost is my time. The paint for the walls was bought with a portion of the money I made selling something on ebay a couple of weeks ago, and I've had the fabric for months. The hospice ladies had saved me a bag full of stuff and charged me £3 for it -' because nobody else would want it' apparently!The orange isn't quite as ' dayglo' as it appears on these photographs - who knew that orange was such a difficult colour to capture accurately?!?"},

All my kitchen cupboards, and the back door, got a fresh coat of paint, so they went from slightly yellowing white paint to nice bright, glossy white again - that's number 17 on the list. Nothing was done while we were in Cornwall - though I suppose I could have added ' Visit The Lost Gardens of Heligan' to the list and crossed that off - I had been waiting 10 years to do it! This week I've painted the dresser, washed all the pottery that was on it and put it all back again, so that's number 18 crossed off the list. There are a couple more things to do in the kitchen - the walls are all going to be painted with something a bit different to the magnolia that's currently on them, and I'm going to be making some new curtains too - if I can find the fabric that I put away safely a few weeks ago! Why is it that something can be hanging around for months, and as soon as it's put away you need it and can't find it? Once it's all done I'll take some photos.I've also crossed number 19 off the list by weeding the driveway and the paved area outside the back door, and today I've crossed number 20 off the list as I've revamped my Dad's bureau and moved it back into the house from the garage.This is what it looked like after its last revamp in July 2012, and before the hallway renovation - painted cream and with some pale wallpaper fixed in the panels and on the drawer front. Now, my treadle sewing machine sits in this spot, and the bureau had been relegated to the garage again. It was looking dirty and chipped so when J went to the allotment just before lunchtime today, I set to.I used a small amount of paint from the same 2 matchpots I used on the drawer unit a little while ago ( I've now painted 2 pieces of furniture with them and still have more than half left in each pot), and used some Laura Ashley wallpaper that I bought at the Sunday carboot 18 months or more ago ( I got 5 rolls for £1), then gave it 2 coats of water based varnish.It fits nicely between our chairs in the conservatory and has provided fantastic storage.We are both really busy with the house and garden, and at the moment it feels as if there aren't enough hours in the day!"},

J managed to get the decorating finished by Saturday lunchtime, after I'd had a trip to town very early to buy another roll of paper as we'd run out . I didn't think it would take 3 rolls of plain paper to decorate a tiny room, but fortunately I managed to get the same batch number.When we moved here 3 years ago the toilet looked like thisAfter the initial renovation it looked like this                               I loved the wallpaper, but after almost 3 years it was definitely past its best and in need of replacing, so now it looks like this.The paper isn't different colours - it's the light coming through the windows that is giving that effectTall walls, dark wallpaper, and definitely handsome rather than pretty; we all love it, and it seems to change colour with the light levels.Total cost - 3 rolls of wallpaper from Wilkos @ £7.46 per roll and a packet of wallpaper paste for 99p.I just reused everything I had in there, but it looks completely different."},
{"title": "52 Projects 15 - Paint it", "date": "Sunday 20 April 2014", "text": "Linking up with Liz for 52 ProjectsIt's 3 years since we moved to Beyond the Nook - we arrived here on Maundy Thursday, 21st April 2011, and when I woke early the morning after, crept into the lounge so that I didn't wake J, and sat looking around me, I wondered what on earth we had done by moving here. Things have improved somewhat since then, but just like the other properties we've owned, there's always something that needs doing - maintenance is boring, but necessary in order to make things last as long as possible and to keep things in a good state of repairThis weekend I've been painting outside. I sanded and painted the porch canopy a couple of weeks ago, and have been waiting for some more nice, but not too windy, weather since then so that I could get on with the rest.Before - half the wall was painted by J when he did the outside of the house in 2012, and I painted half the trellis last year.The other side hadn't been touched as until recently there was a pile of  'stuff' in front of it. That went to the tip before we got rid of the car.On Friday I painted the garden wall on both sides, gave the ' driveway side' of the garden gate one coat of paint, and painted all the trellis on that side too.Painted and looking much better - I'll give the wall and gateanother coat when the wind dies down again.The garage also needs attention this year.I ended up having to paint all of the trellis on this side as J had taken the remaining 'seagrass' paint to the tip!Luckily I had a tin of black gloss paint, so I used that, but not without a few grrrrs first! It ties in nicely with the black guttering on the houseand the black paint at the bottom of the house and garden walls.It's been too windy since then to give the gate and wall another coat, or to paint the gate on the ' garden' side. No point in painting it and ending up with it covered in bits which are blowing around in the very stiff breeze, so it will have to wait for another dry but still day. I also have the garage fascias and window to sand and paint.J has finished decorating the toilet, and while he's been at the allotment planting the last of the potatoes and onions I've finished clearing up and cleaning. I've taken some photos of the finished room so I'll post them tomorrow."},

I thought it was time I used them up.So I made thisI attached the leftover leaves, along with some cut from other shades of brown, to a piece of brown corduruoy which I cut from a remnant that I bought in a charity shop in Scarborough when we visited for J's 50th birthday in March 2012.The back of it is made from a remnant of vintage sheeting leftover from making the patchwork curtains for the kitchen.And now my new cushion is sitting in the conservatory; in my 40+ year old charity shop chair,which I covered in a patchwork of charity shop fabric, along with a cushion which has a cover knitted from charity shop wool, a quilt made from the patches leftover after recovering the chairs, and an antimacassar which also came from a charity shop.Faded, ageing and homespun - a bit like me really!And...

It always looks a bit tatty by the time Spring rolls around again, so, carrying on from last week's 52 Projects when I made some new pictures for the wall, I spent time over the weekend sprucing it up.All the plastic and glass, and the floor have been washed.I've given the wall a fresh coat of paint and hung the new pictures.I've repainted the oak drawer unit, that I rescued from my sister's damp basement when she moved into her house in 1982, as it was looking grubby and chipped. It had been cream for a long time but I fancied a change, so it's been painted with Wickes ' Mocha' and Laura Ashley ' Camomile'.It's had 3 coats of water based varnish to protect it .Bold is coming to stay during the Easter holidays while K and A go off on a short jaunt and he loves to sit on it and ' watch'.I hope he appreciates my efforts to spruce up ' his' room!I have one more picture to stitch to fill an old frame, and also something to finish which I started ages ago and which is destined for the conservatory - that will be this week's Project."},

The covers were perfect  for the pictures in terms of fabric so one was cut up to be used for the background. I had lots of felt and embroidery thread; again carboot purchases, that keep on coming in handy for projects, and I had some old matchpots to paint the frames with.Just simple designs... ...that made use of oddments of felt.I didn't want to spend ages on something that will fade in the sunlightPopped into the painted frames...... and hung on the wall.I still have another couple to do - they'll be a little project for one afternoon this week."},

{"title": "52 Projects No 7 ... Read a book", "date": "Sunday 23 February 2014", "text": "That sounds so simple doesn't it?As a child I had a voracious appetite for books. As an adult it was unusual for me not to have a book on the go.Then, at the age of 41 I went to university, and that killed my love of reading.It wasn't really the fact that I ' had to' read things. When I used the train, I spent the time reading course notes and books; I soaked up information like a sponge and I enjoyed it.No, what did it was the fact that I specialised in English, and I became skilled at critical analysis. It became nigh on impossible just to read literature and enjoy it. I was constantly analysing as I went along, picking things apart and applying literary theory.I've had books passed on to me and I've picked up books at the charity shop for very little money. Most remain unread as the only book I read last year was Richard Madeley's debut novel - it was passed to me by my Mum as a holiday read, and I did read it whilst I was lazing on the beach in the DR last August, but I did pick it apart. Last month we went to Clitheroe, and a charity shop was selling off books 3 for £1. Two were the type of book that my Mum reads, so I scanned the shelves looking for something  I might like. I plumped for this one, and I am pleased to say that I've read it.I enjoyed it for what it was, and whilst I cringed at some of the bad language, and thought the ending was a little weak, I didn't analyse it as I went along.That is huge progress."},

I have some fleece blankets to snuggle under, which are kept in a blanket box when not in use as they don't match the lounge. What I wanted were things that were decorative aswell as functional. I really wanted patchwork, but didn't have the right colours - I'm a ' matchy' sort of person! The leftover piece of curtainAfter making the cushions for the 52 projects in week 1 there was a piece of fabric left. It started out as a single curtain, picked up for £2.49 at Dunelm in 2012, and has been turned into a piece of wall art, 4 cushions, and now a throw. I stitched doilies to it. These have all been bought for pennies at carboots and charity shops. I've accumulated them over the last couple of years and have been saving them for a project.I added an old fleece blanket as wadding, a piece of carboot fabric that I bought in 2011 as the backing, pinned all the layers together with safety pins, and then stitched around each doily.The stitching is decorative and also serves the purpose of holding all the layers together.I stitched along the pintucks too, then added some binding ( cut from the curtains that were in the toilet room when we moved in).I'm really happy with the finished result, and now have to decide what to use to make another one.And, check out my new lampshade! It's a vintage one, found at the charity shop as I dropped some things off yesterday.I ummed and ahhed about it, had just enough money in my purse to pay for it, decided it was perfect, and when I got it home, it was!I am delighted with it, and as I haven't been to the carboot for weeks, and have barely bought anything for the last few months, I decided that the £5 I spent was worth it, particularly as it was the local hospice charity shop, and the hospice cared for J's Auntie B."},
{"title": "52 Projects...Eggless carrot cake", "date": "Friday 24 January 2014", "text": "I've been making carrot cake for over 25 years, and have used the same recipe all of that time.It comes from this book, which my Mum gave to me. It was published in 1984, the year I was married, which probably accounts for the state of it - it has beenwell used as you can see from the grubby page. K and I used to bake it together when she was small.I have been meaning to try making it without eggs for ages, so that we can enjoy it again. I made it today as my Week 3 project for the 52 Projects which I'm joining in withI substituted linseeds and water for the 3 eggs which the recipe called for, white sugar for brown, and added a little black treacle and some sultanas.I baked it in a lined roasting tin, rather than the deep round tin that the recipe calls for. I do this with a lot of cakes as it means that they fit into the mini oven better( it's the only oven I have) and the baking time is greatly reduced, which saves me money. It took around 50 minutes I cut it into 24 pieces, and enjoyed one with a cup of black coffee after I'd eaten my soup at lunchtime.The only identifiable difference between this and a cake made with eggs is that this is a little more dense in texture. It tastes exactly the same.It's been a busy day in the kitchen. I've made carrot cake, scones, carrot and coriander soup, a multi-seed and grain loaf, sundried tomato and herb rolls, a spicy raisin loaf, and pies for tea and for the freezer.I'm wondering why I waited so long to try using the linseeds as a substitute in this cake!"},

It's lovely to have you here and I hope you enjoy what you see.*************************Things don't always go to plan when I'm crafting, and turning the embroidered panel into a cushion for the sofa has turned out to be one of those occasions.When I removed the embroidery from the frame I found that it had become faded in the shape of the circular mount it had been framed in. I've decided what I'm going to do with it, but whilst thinking about it I also decided that I wanted 4 matching cushions for the sofas.Whilst searching for some fabric to make them I came across the remains of a single curtain I bought in Dunelm for £2.49 in May 2012. I used part of it to recover an old piece of wall art for the wall in the lounge in June 2012.It's not a bad place to work is it?I removed the remaining embroidered part from the bottom of the curtain and cut it into 4 equal pieces. Then I took 2 cushion covers and deconstructed them, saving the zips and piping to reuse on something else. Each side of the cushion cover was cut into 4 equal pieces and pinned to the embroidered fabric.The pieces were stitched together, and the curtain lining was turned into a back for each of them.J's sofa, complete with new cushions. My sofa with new cushions.The sofas are 12 years old . They were bought secondhand 8 years ago from somebody who had just finished paying for them ( no payments for a year and then 3 years to pay!). The new cushions provide a little extra support and have made the sofas really comfortable again for our backs.I still have this large piece of curtaining left, so I'm going to turn it into a throw.While I was looking for fabric I found this cushion front that I had stitched together. It's highly unusual for me not to finish something.The centre panel is a beautiful piece of whitework embroidery that was in a box of old linen that I bought at the carboot in 2012. I used  a piece of old curtaining to make a back for the cushion, and it's now in one of the chairs in our bedroom.So, 5 cushions made, but I haven't utilised the embroidered panel in any of them.At least I now have my new cushions for the sofa, and I've completed project 2 of my 52 Projects."},

I suppose that means that I'm a grown-up, because when I was a child it seemed forever from one Christmas to the next!I've taken my time with decorating the house for Christmas; savouring it, rather than feeling that it's something I just want to get over and done with. This year I have 4 trees; the 'big tree' in the lounge, the 'little tree' in the hallway (it was a gift from my parents when K was a little girl ), the girls' tree which I've put in the conservatory ( they used to have it in their bedroom), and a mini white one which used to be in the porch at the old house( I bought it in a post- Christmas sale years ago for £1), which I've put on the dresser in the kitchen. None are new and no decorations are 'new', though I did spend £1 on 10 assorted red baubles at a charity shop local to K and A when we delivered their table and chairs a couple of weeks ago. The rest are a mixture of modern baubles, vintage baubles from my childhood, and vintage baubles that I found at carboot sales last year. I have 3 trees which match the decor of the room that they are in and the 4th is multi-coloured. I know some people get quite het-up about the subject of matching or non-matching trees. Personally, I prefer matching, but it's each to their own, and I love looking at everyone else's whether they match or not.The fireplace and the big tree in the lounge. Decorated in green, white, and neutral colourswhich match the room, with splashes of red on the tree. My footstool has had a makeover too-its legs are now white rather than black, and it has had a new cover made from some vintage fabric which was a Christmas gift from K and A last year.A silver bauble from mine and J's first Christmas tree in 1984. The little house frommy childhood, ivy from the garden and some more modern baubles.Flooded with sunshine. My 30p candlesticks entwined with ivy from the garden, a snowflake and cherubs from the tree that K and KL had in their room when they were childrenOne of the felt poinsettias I made last year sparkling in the sunshine, and ivy from the gardenKL's advent calender which I made when she was 4. I made another one anddonated it to her school as a raffle prize at the Autumn Fayre. It's just waiting for herto come home.My decorated staircase. Two intertwined garlands that were bought more than 20 years ago,ivy from the garden tucked into it, pine cones and baubles from the colour scheme we had at the old houseThe ' picks' have been decorating my staircases for around 20 yearsThe little tree in the hallway stands on my renovated treadleand is decorated with things that used to go on the big tree at the old house.Nothing gets cast aside even if I do change colour schemes.My dresser, all dressed up for Christmas!The tree sits in a planter I bought at the carboot for 30p in 2011, and isdecorated with baubles used at the old house along with a couple of vintageones from my childhoodK and KL chose these when they were children. They stand in a vintage jug which was a present from K and A last Christmas.A string of gold bells and piles of baubles placed in an amber glass dish ( another carboot buy) with a gold candle in a holder. All are things that were used at  the old house but which go with my kitchen colour scheme here.The ' girls' bedroom' tree now stands in the conservatoryand is decorated with multi-coloured baublesThe vintage ones are carboot finds, the wooden ones are from the 1980s, some were bought for the girls by my Mum and the Father Christmases with beardswere dirt cheap in Ikea after Christmas about 10 years ago.That's Christmas decorating finished here at Beyond the Nook.Now I just have to get on with completing the handcrafted gifts!"},

We will have to make another journey as it wouldn't all fit into the car.A few months ago K asked if I could find them a dining table and chairs and revamp them as their Christmas gift. I've seen tables and chairs go at auction for as little as £5! Finding the right thing took a little time, but patience paid off and after several trips to carboot sales, and a couple of auction visits I found something I thought would be perfect. My Mum is perfectly aware of my financial situation, so she said if the bidding went above my budget she would pay if I would renovate, and it could be a joint present. She's a great Mum and we had a lovely time at the auction viewing it and then buying it - it is a joint present and K and A are aware of that.The chairs were a bit drab, but a lovely shape and in great condition.The dropleaf table was scratched and the colour was uneven, but it was nothing that a good sanding couldn't sort out.The chairs had a quick sand and several coats of white paintThe seats were recovered with strips of vintage sheets, pillowcases and duvet coversThe tabletop was sanded and waxed until it gleamed and was as smooth as glassThe legs had several coats of white paintThe table and 2 of the chairs were delivered yesterday, and they look right at home in K and A's loft style apartment.

The circular mirror is the only thing I bought for the room - total renovation spend of £1Some haberdashery items are held in the 20p spice rack, others are in the curtained unit. Scissors are kept in an old Tupperware beaker which cost 10p at the carboot. I found the lamp in a box in the garage which hadn't been unpacked when we moved.The throw was made from vintage sheets and a vintage embroidered tablecloth.Pages from an old craft book bought in a charity shop in Penzance last year were placed into carboot frames to create pictures for the wall.Curtains made from strips of vintage sheets. The old chest freezer is covered in a vintage duvet cover. The artwork on the wall  hung in KL's room about 8 years ago.It's a room that I really enjoy using, and I've been up there today sorting out fabric for my next big sewing project."},

We all met up yesterday for a bridesmaid dress fitting, and a belated birthday celebration.I took an old chair from the garage ( it came as a ' freebie' with the pair of Ercol chairs that I bought at the carboot sale last year - I paid £17 for 3 chairs) and gave it a couple of coats of white emulsion as I wasn't sure how well  paper would cover the dark varnish."},

I have Ladybird books that I've bought for crafting and have, as yet, done nothing with. I have nowhere to put a shelving unit, nor have I anywhere to put the lovely flowery painting in a gilt frame, and I already have a set of kitchen scales, although mine are red and were passed on to me by my Mum.I came home with just a few things; another sheet for KL for uni which cost £1, a soap dish, toothbrush holder and liquid soap dispenser for KL for uni which were still sealed in their packaging for 30p, and my favourite thing which is this lovely glass rose bowl.When I cleaned it up I found the mark ' Made in Edinburgh Scotland' on the bottom"},

{"title": "One year, 51 weeks and 2 days", "date": "Tuesday 16 April 2013", "text": "That's how long it is since we left our home of over 19 years and moved to Beyond the Nook.The house wasn't in a very good state, but it was the best we had looked at and it was in our price range.We've never yet bought a house because we've fallen in love with it; we've never had the luxury of walking into a house and thinking ' Wow'. Each one has been bought because it was what we could afford and because we've known that we had the ability to sort it out.This time it has taken 1 year ,51 weeks and 2 days to do that. There are still a couple of windows that we want to replace, but we will have to save long and hard to pay for them, so to all intents and purposes, the house is finished.I don't have any photos of what it looked like when we first moved in; when all the walls and the ceiling were covered in woodchip wallpaper, when it still had the front door that would have needed just one shove from burglars for them to gain entry, when the staircase had a handrail held up by 2 spindles, 2 newel posts and some glue, but here are some photos of midway through the renovation."},

They were a matching pair; both were covered in the dark brown treacly varnish and had mock leather seats when I bought them. The one on the left was transformed with several coats of cream paint and some 15 year old Laura Ashley fabric and now sits in my Mum's dining room.Firstly a warm welcome to my new followers - it's lovely to have you here, and I hope you enjoy or are inspired by some of the things you see.When I went to bed last Saturday night I didn't think I'd wake up in time to go carbooting on Sunday morning. A few days of chest pains (I knew it was going to be rough as they radiated down my left arm), six hours sleep on Friday night, followed by our trip to Todmorden on Saturday and not going to bed until midnight, left me thinking I would sleep well.I actually woke up at 5.34 am.I'm one of those people who finds it difficult to go back to sleep once they are awake, so rather than lie there listening to J breathing I got up and went.I bought a couple of pieces of vintage Tupperware - 70p for the two; now bleached, washed and in use in my kitchen cupboards, a teacosy still with its tags on for 50p which matches my Mum's kitchen perfectly , and a brand new 2 tier dish drainer for me for 2.00 - not very exciting but all very useful.I also bought this - I paid 5.00 for it.An oak sewing box.It's going to live in the hallway( which, as you can see, now has new doors (yet to be painted) and laminate flooring!!) and will be given the lightest of touches on the outside.The attic room is ongoing. I'm waiting for J to hang 2 mirrors up there, but he's been busy in the hallway, so hanging mirrors came second to hanging doors, particularly when the doors were being stored in our bedroom!I'll wait patiently for the mirrors to be hung, so that the photos can be taken and the blog post can be writtenIn the meantime I've been busy with needle and thread turning something else I already had into an item for the attic. nopin = \"nopin\" I bought this teatowel last year in a charity shop for 50p. It's from the 1960s and was designed for Oxfam. They go for silly money on ebay ( one sold recently for 31.00), but mine is quite washed out and has what looks like gloss paint on the giraffe's hind legs.There was quite a lot of progress in the hallway over half term. We managed to buy the new internal doors and J has fitted some of them, a job that wasn't without a few trials and expletives! The most progress was made on the staircase. I haven't got any good photos of what the hallway looked like when we first moved in, but you can see bits of it on these photos.Taken in July 2011, when we'd just got back from a holiday in Cornwall ( we bought the bedding box there!) You can see the side of the staircase clad in very orange pine tongue and groove, and you can also see the light sapping dark red carpet.More of the orange pine and dark red carpetWhat you can't see is the banister rail that was held up by 2 newel posts, 2 spindles and some glue, or the woodchip that covered every wall and ceiling! I found some framed pictures in the garage last week - they had come from the auction and were in some of the mixed lots that I bought last May. The things I wanted from the boxes of ' stuff' quickly found their place in the house, some unwanted things were good enough to be sold on ebay and more than recouped the money spent on the lots, some were donated to the charity shop and the rest are earmarked for a carboot sale, if the sun decides to actually shine in Lancashire this Summer. nopin = \"nopin\" Both the frames and the pictures left a lot to be desired, but the frames had that wonderful thing - potential. I painted one with several coats of white emulsion and used it to frame my Lloyd Loom advert that K and A bought me for Mothers' Day last year - it was a perfect fit!The Big Brother chair in its 2011 incarnationWell, the grim weather didn't materialise yesterday. It was a lovely, sunny day, but very cold. Great weather for seeing to sew, as I need good light these days, not so good for my hands as they have lost a lot of dexterity, and the cold makes that worse.It took longer to recover the chair than I had anticipated or hoped for - mainly due to the fact that I couldn't remember how the pieces went together! The back and front are obvious - the 7 pieces which connect the back and front aren't quite so obvious. I was okay once I'd looked closely at the photographs of the old cover.My Mum started collecting dolls' houses when my Dad was still alive. She had packed most of them away, had given her largest one to charity, and I sold a lot of the furniture from that on ebay a while ago.I encouraged her to bring them back into the house, and with some rejigging she made space for all but one of them.She gave that one to me, so I'm now the proud owner of Number 3, Queen Street - it was given that address as it's where my maternal Grandad was born.It has pride of place in the attic room.Do you want to see inside? nopin = \"nopin\" Moving my desk away from the window in the attic room, to a place where it fits better, left me in need of a lamp to give me a bit more light when I sew in the evenings as my 1935 Singer doesn't have a light attached.This lamp base was in K's nursery when we decorated it 25 years ago whilst she was still known as ' Fred' or ' Bump'. It was originally pale green but was painted white some years ago. The shade was part of a lamp that I bought for 50p at the carboot last year. When I got the lamp out of the attic last week it didn't work; I changed the fuse, and now it does. It's had a fresh coat of paint too. nopin = \"nopin\" I think about my Dad all the time, but as the 18th anniversary of his sudden and untimely death approaches, the things he said, and the ways in which he influenced me are filling my mind more than usual.In his speech at my wedding nearly 29 years ago, my Dad announced that J and I didn't need lots of money, we just needed to keep on loving each other as much as we did that day.J's extended family looked at my Dad as if he was mad - J and his immediate family were very much the  'poor relations'; they still are compared to his cousins. My family looked at him as if they knew exactly what he was talking about, nodding, and knowing deep down that he was right because that's how the majority of them had lived their lives. My Great Aunt V can be heard sobbing gently on the wedding video, she was so moved by his speech, which he hadn't even written down; it was completely off the cuff and inspired by the card which my Grandma had sent to J and I.The trials and tribulations he spoke of, and which I mentioned in my previous post, had made J and I stronger, tougher, more resilient and resourceful than any of our friends. We had already got through so much, and it has stood us in good stead for the years that have come after. We are still together, most are not, having divorced many years ago, some having married and divorced for a second or third time.People have said that the love that J and I have for each other is clear and evident and very special. That's something which could be seen in my Mum and Dad, and which can be seen in K and A.That makes me happy; happier than any amount of money could make me.So, we have the love, and the resilience, the strength and the resourcefulness, and of course we have each other.We still don't have the money!That has never stopped us trying to achieve as much as we possibly could, even if it is only making things out of what we have.So here is my latest offering, inspired by a no longer worn t-shirt, a song by four very famous people, and my wonderful Dad. nopin = \"nopin\" Old t-shirt, old wool blanket, thrifted thread, bits of old duvet cover for the piping and backing, a sprinkle of imagination and happy memories of 5th May 1984Thanks Dad, for all you taught meI will love and miss you foreverx nopin = \"nopin\" I started, and finished, another cushion over the weekend. I used the same things as I did for the last one - old wool blanket,  leftover felt, thrifted thread, bits of old duvet cover, a sprinkle of imagination .This one also got a few buttons from my tin.J and I also had a lovely walk in the sunshine on Saturday - we didn't have beautiful scenery as we headed to the DIY store, but we had conversation, laughter and each other. After almost thirty two years  together we love each other more than ever. We know each other so very well, and what's more we actually still like each other and want to spend time together. Whilst we may have very few actual pounds in the bank, we have a million pounds of love, and quite honestly I'd rather have that than the money.In his speech at my wedding my Dad spoke of ' the trials, the tribulations, the unemployment' that J and I had already known, and how we had got through that and were there, ' starting out, full of hope, and anticipation'. He was right, we'd already weathered some financial storms; me on a 23.50 per week YOP scheme, J a ' long-term unemployed' statistic for 2 of the 3 years between meeting and marrying. But we did it, we saved the money, we put down the deposit, we signed for the mortgage aged 18 and 21, and we carpeted and furnished the house. Oh, what a good investment that 1000 pound deposit was.After almost 29 years of marriage we're no longer starting out, but we are still full of hope and anticipation, despite all that life has thrown at us and continues to throw. I know deep down that we're not meant to ever have much money, and that really doesn't matter, because we have something which is  far more precious than that; in fact it's priceless.Talking of money, I spent the princely sum of one pound on an item for the attic at yesterday's carboot. I ummed and ahhed about it, and then decided it would be perfect and I'd be foolish not to buy it just to satisfy   a self-imposed spending ban. Hair shirts really don't suit me. nopin = \"nopin\" So here's my pound's worth,  a vintage, bevelled edge, circular mirror which has a diameter of 18\". I bought  it from my regular stall - the one where everything is priced, everything is dirt cheap and the stallholder won't haggle. Personally I think trying to haggle down an already cheap price is insulting. Whilst I enjoy a good haggle as much as the next person, I never haggle over a fair price.Would you have bought it, or worn the hair shirt?NOT SURE WHAT HAS HAPPENED WITH THIS POST BUT YOU'LL HAVE TO SCROLL A LONG WAY DOWN TO FIND THE COMMENTS!!"},

The things I wanted from the boxes of ' stuff' quickly found their place in the house, some unwanted things were good enough to be sold on ebay and more than recouped the money spent on the lots, some were donated to the charity shop and the rest are earmarked for a carboot sale, if the sun decides to actually shine in Lancashire this Summer. nopin = \"nopin\" Both the frames and the pictures left a lot to be desired, but the frames had that wonderful thing - potential. I painted one with several coats of white emulsion and used it to frame my Lloyd Loom advert that K and A bought me for Mothers' Day last year - it was a perfect fit!"},

My family looked at him as if they knew exactly what he was talking about, nodding, and knowing deep down that he was right because that's how the majority of them had lived their lives. My Great Aunt V can be heard sobbing gently on the wedding video, she was so moved by his speech, which he hadn't even written down; it was completely off the cuff and inspired by the card which my Grandma had sent to J and I.The trials and tribulations he spoke of, and which I mentioned in my previous post, had made J and I stronger, tougher, more resilient and resourceful than any of our friends. We had already got through so much, and it has stood us in good stead for the years that have come after. We are still together, most are not, having divorced many years ago, some having married and divorced for a second or third time.People have said that the love that J and I have for each other is clear and evident and very special. That's something which could be seen in my Mum and Dad, and which can be seen in K and A.That makes me happy; happier than any amount of money could make me.So, we have the love, and the resilience, the strength and the resourcefulness, and of course we have each other.We still don't have the money!That has never stopped us trying to achieve as much as we possibly could, even if it is only making things out of what we have.So here is my latest offering, inspired by a no longer worn t-shirt, a song by four very famous people, and my wonderful Dad. nopin = \"nopin\" Old t-shirt, old wool blanket, thrifted thread, bits of old duvet cover for the piping and backing, a sprinkle of imagination and happy memories of 5th May 1984Thanks Dad, for all you taught meI will love and miss you foreverx"},
{"title": "Cushions, love,life, and spending a pound on the attic...", "date": "Monday 4 February 2013", "text": "nopin = \"nopin\" I started, and finished, another cushion over the weekend. I used the same things as I did for the last one - old wool blanket,  leftover felt, thrifted thread, bits of old duvet cover, a sprinkle of imagination .This one also got a few buttons from my tin.J and I also had a lovely walk in the sunshine on Saturday - we didn't have beautiful scenery as we headed to the DIY store, but we had conversation, laughter and each other. After almost thirty two years  together we love each other more than ever. We know each other so very well, and what's more we actually still like each other and want to spend time together. Whilst we may have very few actual pounds in the bank, we have a million pounds of love, and quite honestly I'd rather have that than the money.In his speech at my wedding my Dad spoke of ' the trials, the tribulations, the unemployment' that J and I had already known, and how we had got through that and were there, ' starting out, full of hope, and anticipation'. He was right, we'd already weathered some financial storms; me on a 23.50 per week YOP scheme, J a ' long-term unemployed' statistic for 2 of the 3 years between meeting and marrying. But we did it, we saved the money, we put down the deposit, we signed for the mortgage aged 18 and 21, and we carpeted and furnished the house. Oh, what a good investment that 1000 pound deposit was.After almost 29 years of marriage we're no longer starting out, but we are still full of hope and anticipation, despite all that life has thrown at us and continues to throw. I know deep down that we're not meant to ever have much money, and that really doesn't matter, because we have something which is  far more precious than that; in fact it's priceless.Talking of money, I spent the princely sum of one pound on an item for the attic at yesterday's carboot. I ummed and ahhed about it, and then decided it would be perfect and I'd be foolish not to buy it just to satisfy   a self-imposed spending ban. Hair shirts really don't suit me. nopin = \"nopin\" So here's my pound's worth,  a vintage, bevelled edge, circular mirror which has a diameter of 18\". I bought  it from my regular stall - the one where everything is priced, everything is dirt cheap and the stallholder won't haggle. Personally I think trying to haggle down an already cheap price is insulting. Whilst I enjoy a good haggle as much as the next person, I never haggle over a fair price.Would you have bought it, or worn the hair shirt?NOT SURE WHAT HAS HAPPENED WITH THIS POST BUT YOU'LL HAVE TO SCROLL A LONG WAY DOWN TO FIND THE COMMENTS!!"},

You can also see part of the throw I made from a vintage tablecloth and thrifted sheets/ duvet covers The felt was bought for Christmas for KL about 8 years ago when she wanted crafty items. The thread was from a carboot buy - a huge bag of embroidery thread for £1 last year. The fabric is part of a green wool blanket that I bought at the Salvation Army shop last year- I was going  to use it in the lounge, but when I bought the fabric to revamp the Ercol chair and the sofa cushions the green of the blanket clashed. The piping is made with the trim from a charity shop duvet cover which I bought last year and which I used to line the new attic room curtains. The quest to use up things I have and spend no money revamping the attic room continues - I have to find some small screws to fix the hinges back onto something I revamped during the week, I have some more cushion covers to make, a chair to recover and some frames to revamp so that I can put up some pictures.I'm really enjoying the challenge of this though - it has made me more creative than usual, is keeping me occupied and is giving me a huge amount of satisfaction, not to mention using up things that I've had for ages.   ﻿"},

I don't mind changing things if I come up with a better idea as we never spend a lot of money on anything.  The first attic makeover cost very little - just lots of white paint, a lot of hard work stripping, sanding and painting, some work constructing a new cupboard for the boiler, and the purchase of a secondhand sofa bed - we paid around one tenth of the price of buying it new from A**os. It was a light, bright and airy room - a nice place to be, but it didn't last.The first makeover - June 2011As renovations in the rest of the house took place it became a dumping ground for all kinds of things - things that we weren't using anymore, treasures that I'd bought but which didn't yet have a home, fabric, wool, 2 exercise cycles.  I've had a busy week sorting things out - there have been a couple of trips to the charity shop, with one more to go, and there has been a trip to the tip.These photos were taken midweek.Some furniture moved, and at least I can now see part of the floorI moved my desk from under the windowIt's now at the other end of the room. This will be my new sewing space. At the moment I'm using my sewing machine on the dining table.The old chair bed went to someone who was grateful for it,meaning there's now more space in this part of the attic room. Narnia is just through the mirrored door!A bit more progress was made yesterday afternoon. Some more furniture was movedand the boiler cupboard which J built out of some old wardrobes, and 2 matching cupboardswhich hold my stockpile of groceries, were painted white. I just need to paint the hinges and handleswith some gloss paint today.It's already beginning to look clean, bright and uncluttered again, only this time the room will have a different feel, as I make use of some of the vintage things which I've bought for pennies over the last year or so. The vintage sheets which I've bought are finally being made into things which are useful and beautiful and that I will be able to see all the time, rather than having to open a drawer to look at them and admire the colours, patterns and quality of the fabrics.I am absolutely determined that no money will be spent on this room makeover. I'm using leftover paint, fabric from the stash, pictures from old books, old picture frames, leftover felt from K and A's Christmas presents and a lot of imagination and hard work.It can, and will, be done for nothing, it's coming along nicely and all will be revealed when it's finished."},

It stands on an old toy box which ,this year, iscovered in a 50p vintage tablecloth.I hate being able to see the legs at the bottom of the tree, so I used an old garland, some ivy from the garden and some bits that came in a large bag of pot pourri yearsago to disguise them.The fireplace, trimmed with an artificial garland which is years old,ivy from the garden, a few old decorations, and the poinsettias I made.The clock and candlesticks seemed to tie in quite nicely so I left them on themantel.The table decoration stands in a glass dish which is one of Mum's recent cast-offs. The linencame in my carboot job lot in the summer so cost less than 10p.The candle came with me from the old house, the little wreath is about 20 years old as are the cream baubles. I finished it with ivy from the garden, and the windowsill has been decorated to matchusing an old garland.Food shopping has been 'completed' - the extra items amounted to some profiteroles for KL, a jar of beetroot and a tub of soya cream for J and I, and a bottle of cordial as K and A are visiting after Christmas- we don't drink it, and I didn't have any left. Everything else will be made from ingredients that I normally buy and keep in the cupboards, fridge and freezer. There will be the 3 of us for Christmas this year. K and A are spending Christmas in Paris and we have arranged to see them (and the beautiful Bold !) on 29th.
