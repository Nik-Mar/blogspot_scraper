I had sent to my branch one of our mobile computer labs--8 laptops, plus an instructor laptop, so those of us without dedicated program computer lab space can offer computer programs--and a kit of MaKey MaKeys, and a group of 9-12 year olds and I set to creating our own computer games with the added excitement of using the MaKeys to play them. Here's what we did.Part I: MaKey MaKeysTo get things started, I introduced how circuits work; completing a circuit is key to getting the MaKeys to function properly, so the introduction seemed apt. From there, kids opened their MaKey MaKey kits and we started to attach the alligator clips to the board. With a MaKey MaKey, you can turn anything that will conduct electricity into a computer key. We used paper clips attached to an index card to help keep everything orderly.Getting the MaKeys set up took a few minutes, but pretty quickly the kids were able to figure out how they could complete their circuits and get their MaKeys to function. They were experimenting with their setups and playing the default MaKey games before I knew it.Part II: ScratchAfter a half hour of MaKey setup and experimentation, we moved on to the portion of the program where we created computer games. We used Scratch--which, I found out during the program, about half of the kids had already used in school programs. Scratch is a free, web-based, visual programming platform created by MIT, and it offers lots of options for creating computer programs at varying levels of complexity.We set out to create simple maze games in which the player avatar--called a Sprite in Scratch--navigates a pathway using the arrow keys until reaching the end and finishing the game. I had created a sample maze before the program, and I projected the game's scripts onto a blank wall to provide examples of ways to make a maze game. I moved from child to child for about 45 minutes, coaching them on creating their game backdrops; the next steps in their programming; talking about x and y axes; asking questions to help them think about how they could tell the game to do what they want, etc. After trial and error and lots of tinkering with their code scripts, the kids were able to get their games to do what they wanted.Part III: Playing Scratch Games with MaKey MaKeysVictory!With the Scratch games in working order, the children plugged their MaKey MaKey apparatuses back into their laptops so they could use their paper clip keys to play their games. Several of the kids tried one another's games before their parents rejoined us in the room, at which point it was great to hear the kids explaining what they'd created and to see them guide their parents through playing their games. I heard lots of feedback that the kids would be continuing to experiment with making Scratch games at home.That's a sign of success for a maker program, if you ask me--kids learn new skills and discover new interests that they'd like to continue to pursue."},

If you're unfamiliar with this story, allow me to recommend Charlotte Huck's version, illustrated by Anita Lobel.When I adapted this story for a flannel board, I created flannel pieces to give a visual to the jewels and slimy creatures with which the fairy in the story \"gifts\" the two girls. That means that I'm doing straight oral storytelling for the setup of the story, with the flannel pieces starting about halfway in. I've found that this story is plenty captivating for most audiences preschool and older--a good story keeps you interested regardless of what there is to look at.I will say, when I tell this story, I modify the ending a bit. Instead of the kind sister ending up getting married to a prince, the jewels her dowry, I tell a version in which she ends up venturing out on her own and finding true friends--people who respect her for who she is, not what she has. Let's call it my feminist re-envisioning. Check out this week's full Flannel Friday roundup on Hannah's blog Lovin' the Library."},

McSweeney's McMullens. 23 Sept. 2014. p. 384.When we last saw the three West siblings--Kit, M.K., and Zander--they had had quite an adventure: discovering a treasure hinted at by a secret map given to them by their father; letting a bully of a young explorer take credit for finding the treasure; safely securing another secret map hidden at the cache; and gaining entry to the Explorers Academy. You'd think life might be somewhat calm after such an experience, but not so for the Wests. The stakes of success at the Academy are ever higher now that the threat of war looms for the United States and its Allied Nations, and Kit is struggling to crack the secret map he and his siblings discovered in Arizona. Some sleuthing leads him to discover that this map points him to a place called King Triton's Lair, but figuring out the location is only a small part of this new quest. You see, all ships trying to pass through King Triton's Lair have sunk. And if you try to avoid this treacherous stretch of sea, you'll still have to contend with the pirates.It's been about a year and a half since I read Taylor's first installment in this Expeditioners series, and I found myself quickly pulled back into the reimagined modern world that she's created. It's full of interesting Newly Discovered Lands, strange and wonderful creatures, and a whole host of places and animals to discover--a perfect setting for any explorer. The feelings of a surveillance state and the warmongering in the government have only grown, with some of the Wests' immigrant classmates detained for questioning after an assassination attempt on a high government official. The mood created by this backdrop for the main story makes this second novel in the series equal parts adventure and menace--in other words, a story that will pull you in just like the mysterious forces acting in King Triton's Lair. I also particularly appreciate the character development in this sequel, especially with regard to Kit; Taylor could easily have just relied on the characterizations she created in the first novel, but she really allows her characters to mature in their relationships and their perspectives. A lot more is happening in their world and quest than the Wests ever knew--and it's a treat to ride along with them.I have a handful of readers who absolutely loved the first novel, The Expeditioners and the Treasure of Drowned Man's Canyon, and I cannot wait to hand them this second installment. I think there's high demand right now for great adventure and exploration titles like this, especially considering the popularity of such series as the Superstition Mountain books, which are great readalikes for this title. The Expeditioners is an excellent steampunk adventure series with tons of heart and appeal.Review copy provided by the publisher."},
{"title": null, "date": "Friday, June 13, 2014", "text": "Being a children's librarian in an ever-growing community means a consistently bustling story time schedule, both in the library and for outreach visits. To keep my material fresh and exciting for me, and thus for the kids I'm reading with, I like to pick new books to share pretty regularly. I've had great success with a handful of books in particular lately, and I wanted to share them with you (in case you're looking for something to save you from reading that same go-to for the millionth time this month).Favorite Interactive BooksDon't Push the Button! by Bill Cotter - This silly story is just begging for you to push the big red button. When you finally do, plenty of interesting things ensue. As will delighted laughter.I Got the Rhythm by Connie Schofield-Morrison and Frank Morrison - A girl steps out of her home and immediately catches the rhythm of everything around her. It's impossible to not move along to the beat of this text, and the words invite plenty of great action. The diverse children depicted in the illustrations make this an exemplary story time choice.Lines That Wiggle by Candace Whitman - This title was brought to my attention by a post on The Library as Incubator Project, where Jayne Gammons talked about sharing this story while having kids wiggle their bodies the way the lines on the page are wiggling. I've been having kids wiggle their fingers along with the story, to great success.Tap the Magic Tree by Christie Matheson - Follow a tree through the \"magic\" of the seasons, from bare branches to buds, flowers, and apples, before the leaves change colors and blow away. Kids have a look of wonder when I've shared this book, and it invites plenty of talk about seasons and the life cycle.Favorite Folk TalesClay Boy by Mirra Ginsburg and Jos. A. Smith - A lonely old couple form a boy out of clay to keep them company, but it turns out the clay boy has an insatiable appetite. Luckily for everyone in the village, the local golden-eyed goat's wisdom is a match for the creature's hunger/The Three Triceratops Tuff by Stephen Shaskan - This dinosaur retelling of the Three Billygoats Gruff is a great, well-paced read, with an opportunity to give yourself short T-Rex arms. Side note: When I read this story, I rename the biggest triceratops \"Babs\" instead of the written \"Bob,\" because why should all the dinosaurs only be boys?~~*~~What have been your recent favorite story time reads?"},
{"title": null, "date": "Monday, June 9, 2014", "text": "At the end of April, while I was struggling as a reader, I decided to spend a few hours of my vacation in a Reading Spa at Mr. B's Emporium of Reading Delights, a fabulous indie bookshop. At Mr. B's, you reserve your Reading Spa in advance, giving their staff some info about your personal reading tastes. This allows them to pair you, the spa recipient, with a well-read staff member who has similar tastes, thus upping the chances of said staffer being able to make recommendations that the spa recipient will actually like.The Reading Spa itself starts with a 30-45 minute chat in which the recipient talks about books, authors, themes, etc., they like, while the staffer take notes and asks clarification questions. Note: At no point in the conversation does the staffer make title recommendations.Once the conversation is over, the spa recipient is given some tea and cake while the staffer heads to the bookshop stacks to pull recommended titles. Upon collecting piles of books--my Reading Spa included 25 recommended titles--the staffer returns to the spa-goer and book talks each title, making sure to note why they thought the reader might find said title interesting. The Reading Spa concludes with the spa recipient left on their own to browse the recommended titles and make decisions about what books to take home from the experience.For me, this Reading Spa was pure luxury. It was wonderful to be on the other end of talking about books--me sharing what I like as opposed to me being the careful listener of others' tastes. Having full freedom to talk at length about my reading tastes led me to discover things about myself as a reader that I had never consciously realized. For instance, that I am a science fiction fan. I never would have self-identified as a sci-fi reader, although considering what I love to read, yes, that makes sense. Also, without talking about lots of books I've enjoyed, I wouldn't have been able to easily put my finger on the fact that I particularly enjoy narrative structures in which multiple characters share narrative duties. I had previously read maybe half a dozen such books in a year, but had never overtly realized that I have a preference for this style of narration.I left with a stack of 15 books--enough that I needed to check two bags on my flight home instead of one--all of which I have been thoroughly enjoying. But I also left with some thoughts on reader's advisory. The three big ones follow.Readers often don't know what kind of readers they are. Especially young readers.I am a librarian. I read a lot. I talk about books every day. I've taken reader's advisory trainings and classes. I possess the vocabulary to talk about books and reading. And yet, I did not recognize that I am a sci-fi reader. I did not fully understand what actually draws me to a book, and I am theoretically an expert on books. If someone like me isn't able to self-identify my reading proclivities, how might the casual reader, the young reader, the struggling reader be expected to do so? It takes a wide pool of books to really suss out a reader's true colors. Think of those kids who come to the reference desk and say they like fantasy. Great! But, in fact, upon further conversation, it's not really fantasy that attracts them--it's not magic, it's not dragons, it's retellings of folk and fairy tales. Unless you compare a wide range of books read, something most readers don't know or think to do, it's hard to stumble upon that specific preference. Which leads to my second thought...Quality reader's advisory takes time.I'm talking about those reader's advisory interactions where a customer comes to the desk and says, \"I'm looking for something good to read.\" Not for class, not for a project, just for fun. These true reader's advisory interactions take time, because you need to have a conversation about books and that customer as a reader. A full conversation.I think that, since reader's advisory so often happens at the reference desk, we have gotten into a habit of treating reader's advisory requests like reference questions. That is, the customer provides the query, and we provide the response. One-two and done. That's not going to be sufficient for quality reader's advisory, for helping readers find lots that they'll enjoy reading. Quality reader's advisory means starting with a basic response question--\"What are some books that you have enjoyed?\"--and encouraging the reader to keep talking from there. Quality reader's advisory means the staff person asks questions to deeper understand a reader's preferences, but does not interrupt the reader's answers with suggestions. Suggestions come only after the reader has finished detailing their reading life.And on that note, please notice that I say \"suggestions\" plural. Because quality reader's advisory will not leave the reader with just one book to try next. Quality reader's advisory will leave the reader with a whole host of possibilities for reading, able to be perused and enjoyed over the course of several months and subsequent library visits. Reader's advisory isn't a one-and-done service, not when done right.And, lastly...One staffer cannot be an expert on every genre or format.One of the most transformative aspects of my Reading Spa experience was that I got to talk to someone who likes the same types of books as me. That may seem obvious, but it doesn't always happen in reader's advisory interactions at the library. So much of the reader's advisory training I see in libraries involves bringing staff up to speed on every genre so that we all have five go-to titles to recommend in any given reader's area of preference. That's good to satisfy those reference-style RA questions--I need a historical fiction for my book report--but not so much for quality reader's advisory.I think libraries need to take more of a slow food approach to quality reader's advisory. That is, it won't all happen instantaneously via whoever happens to be staffing the desk when the reader comes in. Think of your staff instead as artisans of different genres and formats. If a customer comes in wanting animal stories, direct that customer to your staffer who enjoys and thus reads animal stories. Know and use your staff reading expertise. The reader's advisory interactions that follow will be that much richer and successful because a person who knows what they're talking about is serving as guide to a reader with similar tastes. The resultant recommendations will be better, and customers will be happier.~~*~~My Reading Spa experience has left me ruminating quite a bit on what reader's advisory does and looks like in the library setting. How do you use reader's advisory to truly support your readers as opposed to just making sure they leave with a book?"},

This summer marks Year Two of our Picture Book Walk at Quail Ridge Park, a local county park with a number of paved trails, one of which boasts 17 beautiful, handmade signs displaying the entirety of a picture book, spread by spread. For details on the \"hows\" of the project, check out my post on the topic from last summer.This year, the book around the lake trail at Quail Ridge Park is the immaculately illustrated Berlioz the Bear, by Jan Brett. The introductory sign encourages wandering readers to pay special attention to what's going on in the illustrations around the edges; Brett is known for fitting intricate visual storytelling in every space of the page. While this book doesn't have as explicit a connection to nature as last year's choice (The Curious Garden by Peter Brown), I chose it for the walk because it invites leisurely reading. The buildup of the story, the visual interest, the climax of the story--they all lend to a relaxing stroll along the trail while enjoying a great book.The library and parks department team up to put on a festive kickoff event in the lodge adjacent to the Picture Book Walk trail. After some introductory remarks at sign #1, as well as the option of \"guided walks\" (in which a library staffer or volunteer leads a group and reads from the pages), children and families are invited into the lodge for a range of activities. This year, we offered the following slate:light refreshments of a cake (donated by Sam's Club) and cookies, along with plenty of water (all outdoor activities require continued hydration!)summer reading signups for children, teens, and adultsa memory game involving matching overturned pictures of instruments (many corresponding to those played by Berlioz and his friends in the book)summer reading tattoosshaker instrument craft station (decorate and attach a colorful strip of paper to an empty plastic water bottle, use a funnel to add ½ cup rice, top the contents off with a pretty bead, and duct tape the whole thing shut; voila, recycled shaker!)tree cookie necklace craft from the Parks Department (using wood from invasive cedar that has to be removed from the parks)Parks Department informationSt. Louis Lions soccer team information and ball drills with real playersThese eight activity stations were ongoing throughout the two-hour event, with a special performance halfway through the kickoff by one of the park rangers. He shared and passed around a huge range of animal pelts of creatures indigenous to Missouri. Kids had a great time feeling the different furs and seeing the range of sizes of these animals. Most recognizable by far: the skunk.I had teen library volunteers to help staff the library's activity stations, as well as some assistance from my colleague Miss Melanie at the summer reading signup station. The library could not have offered so many activities at the kickoff without their help.In the course of the two-hour kickoff event, we shared reading and recreation with just over 200 people, mostly children and their families. We got tons of folks signed up for summer reading, and we generated a ton of excitement about returning to the park to experience the Picture Book Walk again. The Berlioz the Bear installation will be up for several months, hopefully giving every interested family a chance to experience it.If you happen to be in the Wentzville, Missouri area this summer, I do hope you'll stop by!"},
{"title": null, "date": "Tuesday, June 3, 2014", "text": "Welcome back for the latest installment of Common Core IRL (In Real Libraries), a blog hop featuring outstanding librarians and bloggers Mary Ann Scheuer at Great Kid Books, Alyson Beecher at Kit Lit Frenzy, and Cathy Potter and Louise Capizzo at The Nonfiction Detectives. Our goal: to provide examples of and facilitate thinking about what the Common Core State Standards look like in real libraries.This month, we're visiting the topic of Colonial America. To cover this topic to the best of our abilities, resources for a variety of ages and uses will be on the following blogs:Colonies and the American Revolution (grades 3-4) -- The Nonfiction DetectivesLife in Colonial America (grades 3-5) -- Great Kid BooksRead Aloud Historical Fiction (grades 1-6) -- The Show Me LibrarianDigital Resources (grades 4-6) -- Great Kid BooksPrimary Sources (grades 4-6) -- Kid Lit FrenzyChildren across the United States usually encounter basic information about Colonial America when they learn about the First Thanksgiving, usually in preschool or in kindergarten. More in-depth learning, however, takes place in the older elementary years, when students encounter a (hopefully) more nuanced historical perspective. By supplementing this factual learning with historical fiction read alouds, children can engage in a deeper understanding of the time period and what it was like to be a Colonial American.I've divided the read aloud titles discussed in this post into two age ranges: grades 1-3, and grades 4-6.Younger Read Alouds (grades 1-3):Anne Hutchinson's Way by Jeannine Atkins, pictures by Michael Dooling (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, 2007)     This picture book conveys the story of Anne Hutchinson and her family, Puritans who arrived in the colonies only to experience further religious persecution. Anne had strict religious beliefs about inclusiveness, rights of all community members to preach, and non-violence, for which she was ultimately banished from colonial Boston. The story is based on the life of the real Anne Hutchinson and her family.     Anne's perspective on faith and what is right is clearly very different from male colonial lawmakers, and the story provides opportunities to connect to standard RL.3.3, which focuses on describing characters and how their traits and actions contribute to what happens in the story.Pilgrim Cat by Carol Antoinette Peacock (Albert Whitman & Company, 2004)     This picture book follows a young girl, Faith, as she journeys on the Mayflower and endures the first year at Plymouth Rock, culminating in the First Thanksgiving. She shares the experience with a cat whom she discovers on the Atlantic voyage and names Pounce. Faith and her fellow colonists encounter Samoset and Squanto, Wampanoags who may be familiar to young readers from their previous Thanksgiving lessons.     The illustrations do much to convey the amount and variety of work that went into staying alive on the journey to and in the new colony, connecting to standard RL.2.7, which emphasizes using information from both words and illustrations to demonstrate understanding of the contents of a text.Older Read Alouds (grades 4-6):Our Strange New Land: Elizabeth's Diary, Jamestown, Virginia, 1609 by Patricia Hermes (Scholastic, 2002)     Part of the \"My America\" series of fictional first-person historical diaries, this book (and its two sequels) allows readers insight to a young girl's perspective of the day-to-day struggles and new experiences associated with living in Colonial America. A number of historical figures, like John Smith and Pocahontas, make appearances in the storyline, allowing readers to make direct connections to historical facts they learn in social studies lessons.     The diary format of this book provides ample opportunity to explore pacing in storytelling. This exploration fits with standard RL.5.5, which deals with understanding how a series of chapters (or, in this case, diary entries) creates the structure of a story.*A note about read alouds on the topic of Colonial America: As I did some research to locate a variety of historical fiction titles that could fit this Common Core IRL topic, I discovered that there is something of a void in this area of literature for children. Most of the books I found were published before 2000, and of these, many were culturally insensitive--a disproportionate number added drama through tales of abduction by Native Americans. While abductions did occur in Colonial America, these texts overwhelmingly depict Native Americans in stereotypical and harmful ways. The majority of the more recent titles I found deal specifically with the American Revolution; while a worthwhile topic on its own, life during the American Revolution was not the same as life during the Colonial period between 1620 and 1775. There is a real dearth of high-quality children's historical fiction set in Colonial America. Given the ubiquity of the topic in school curricula, one would hope that authors and publishers will rectify this lack of sensitive and compelling Colonial America stories."},

As I've mentioned before, our public internet computers are not in immediate proximity to the children's area. Which means, if a caregiver wants to use the computers and there's no one to attend to the child/ren in the children's area, the kids have to stay in the computer area.As I've also mentioned before, we aim to do what we can to keep these young customers engaged and happy while they wait for their grownups. We've got coloring books and crayons, portable toys, quick reading material... And, now, stand-along Where's Waldo sheets.You see, I had a Where's Waldo book that was falling apart. While the binding was shot, many of the pages were just fine. So I spent a few minutes locating Waldo on the pages that were in good shape, then cut those pages right out of the (now withdrawn) book. I printed up some sheets with the library logo and the request to return the pages to the information desk when the quest for Waldo was complete. Then, when I was visiting the cataloguing department to laminate the pages for our second annual Picture Book Walk, I laminated these standalone Waldo activity sheets, too.Now the sheets are at the information desk, and I anticipate them getting plenty of use this summer when the days are hot and the computer bays are packed.And who knows!

In fact, I'll find myself at work, flipping through picture books, and suddenly I'll see how a story might translate to a felt version. I must say, that's not something that ever just popped into my head before.I was particularly surprised, then, when I woke up one day on my morning off thinking, \"I'm going to make finger puppets today!\" And, reader, that's what I did.Since lots of my storytimes are outreach events for classrooms of up to 60 preschoolers, I chose the story of The Little Red Hen for my puppets. The story is repetitive, which I find works well with groups, and because the characters are all different animals, I knew the finger puppets would still be easily differentiable from the back of the storytime room.I created my own freehand patterns for these puppets, although I spent about 20 minutes on Pinterest looking at what other folks have done for hen, cow, pig, and cat finger puppets--I wanted to get a sense of how I thought my puppets might best look. After hand-drawing my pattern, I used felt, embroidery floss, some small buttons, and puffy paint to get the final products.These puppets have been making the outreach storytime rounds with me, much to the delight of many a local preschooler.

{"title": null, "date": "Friday, May 16, 2014", "text": "My last few takeaways from the 2014 School Library Journal Public Library Leadership Think Tank in Nashville came from a presentation by Denise Lyons. While Lyons had lots of interesting things to say about her topic--connecting to broad strategic development--the two points from her talk that hit home most to me really come down to staff empowerment. Admittedly, staff empowerment and empowering youth services folks in particular is on my mind a lot these days, what with the whole M.O. of the Storytime Underground. Thus the impact these two statements have had on me.First, there's a way to move away from the most common roadblock in implementing a new service: \"We tried that and it didn't work.\" That statement forces staff to slam on the brakes, taking away agency from people moving forward with ideas--ideas which, in all likelihood, they've given a fair amount of thought and research. BUT, says Lyons, you can restructure that negative shutdown by empowering the staff members who make the seemingly idea-ended statement. Get the staffers focused on a historical lack of success on the team of people who are figuring out how to launch the new iteration. They'll be able to bring their perspectives of what went wrong to the discussion, simultaneously letting them feel listened to and allowing the project team to take into account and make plans for historical problem points in order to avoid or address them this time around. Empowering!The other big empowerment takeaway is most excellent: to get staff to do micro trainings, which Lyons called \"Mini TED Talks.\" The argument is that staff don't need hours of trainer certification and experience at conferences in order to talk for 10 minutes about that thing they're really knowledgeable about. If a staffer is good at something and hearing about it would positively impact the work of other staffers, create a platform for micro trainings where that expertise sharing can take place. (That's basically the entire methodology behind guerrilla-style trainings anyway; a rose by any other name and all that jazz.) I've made no secret of my desire to see more folks speaking up about and sharing the excellent work they do, both for personal empowerment, advocacy, and the sharing of best practices that can result. Hearing that call for expertise sharing from another forum makes me very, very happy.~~*~~That wraps up my recaps of the 2014 SLJ Think Tank. I had an excellent time attending the conference, and I very much look forward to the conversations that will continue and develop out of the ideas that were shared in Nashville!"},

At the very least it costs time, then oftentimes you add in craft supplies or purchased decorations, and pretty soon you have something else in the library that'll collect dust and/or look dated when you forget to take it down in time. I'd much rather put my time and effort into appealing materials displays than decorating.But.You know those uber-popular kids books that are so heavy their bindings break much too quickly? Think Star Wars character guides and Disney storybook collections. They always have a high damage rate, as the many thick pages stress the binding. I've been replacing a lot of these titles recently, but instead of just withdrawing and recycling the pages of the fallen-apart copies, I saved them.And I made decorations for the library.Recycled Book Bunting in all its colorful, draped glory!I know! Me! Decorations!A close-up of the bunting.I made a triangle template out of cardstock and cut out recognizable characters from the pages of these books: Mickey Mouse, Nemo, Mulan, Bambi, C-3PO, Yoda, Princess Leia, etc. I also made triangles out of bright blue and green, our library's colors, and strung all the little flags up on some purple string to make bunting. Our maintenance staffer hung them Monday morning, and I must say I'm pleased with the results.So, despite my being someone who generally abhors decorating, apparently I think it's a grand idea when it repurposes illustrated books that have met an untimely demise. By turning the recognizable illustrations into colorful bunting, we're getting more bang for our buck out of these titles.And now I'll go back to my general \"our decor is fine how it is\" M.O."},

{"title": null, "date": "Thursday, May 8, 2014", "text": "Today marks the first time I'm participating in Common Core IRL (In Real Libraries), a blog hop featuring outstanding librarians and bloggers Mary Ann Scheuer at Great Kids Books, Alyson Beecher at Kit Lit Frenzy, and Cathy Potter and Louise Capizzo at The Nonfiction Detectives. I'm joining the ranks to add an additional perspective to what the Common Core State Standards look like in real libraries.I should say that the Common Core State Standards are controversial here in Missouri, and it's unclear how much longer they'll be part of the state curriculum. Many of the principles within the CCSS, however, remain excellent for thinking about sharing excellent books--especially non-fiction--with young readers, so I have no qualms about continuing to use the CCSS as a lens to think about the readers' advisory I do in my public librarian job.This week's topic for Common Core IRL is that quintessential American springtime activity: baseball. I'm talking about non-fiction baseball titles for beginning readers, but you can find other baseball titles for other age ranges on the other Common Core IRL posts this week:Here's our batting line-up for Common Core IRL: Baseball:read aloud picture books (grades K-3) -- Kid Lit Frenzymiddle grade readers (grades 3-4) -- Great Kid Booksolder middle grade readers (grades 5-6) -- The Nonfiction Detectivesbeginning readers (grades K-2) -- The Show Me Librarian~*~No matter how contentious CCSS may get here in Missouri, baseball is a staple. Not a day goes by that I don't see a dozen kids in the library in their baseball/softball uniforms or St. Louis Cardinals gear, and quite frequently they want books to read that support this interest.In a public library setting, the librarian may not be as familiar with a particular child and their reading level as a school librarian would be. That means it's particularly important to have a range of books on a topic, each at a different level of complexity, so that the reader can get the right book for them. On the topic of baseball for beginning readers, that leaves libraries with several excellent options:Baseball is Fun! by Robin Nelson (Lerner, 2014)This simple text for very beginning readers introducesbasic baseball concepts, and it includes an illustrationof a baseball field, a glossary, and an index.Cool Baseball Facts by Kathryn Clay (Capstone, 2011)For beginning readers who already understand the fundamentalsof baseball, this title with interesting tidbits and trivia will matchinterest with reading level.On the Team: Baseball by Mason Burdick (Gareth Stevens, 2012)Higher-level beginning readers will enjoy this in-depth explorationof baseball, its history, and playing basics. Includes interesting textfeatures called \"The Coach's Corner,\" which share additional details.How does this all fit with the Common Core? For beginning readers, the CCSS emphasize reading informational texts appropriate for their grade level (CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.RI.1.10, CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.RI.2.10). That means the library having a batting order with non-fiction options at different levels of complexity, all of them heavy hitters that will engage and interest readers. As beginning readers visit the library this spring and summer completely amped about baseball, we'll have plenty to offer."},
{"title": null, "date": "Wednesday, May 7, 2014", "text": "At the second annual School Library Journal Public Library Leadership Think Tank, which took place at the end of April in Nashville, the day-long professional development included a collaborative think tank session. All attendees broke into groups on a variety of topics of interest to public library youth services, and those groups brainstormed and discussed.I was facilitator and note-taker for the Savvy Tech Strategy group, and my excellent groupmates had plenty of thought-provoking ideas and perspectives to share. A recap of highlights follows.Savvy Tech StrategyHow do you build your technology toolkit?Collaborate with other institutions that have technology to share information and supplies. There's no need for everyone to buy the same databases, for instance, if they are already available through your state library. That's just one example of not unnecessarily duplicating tools.Ask a series of questions to inform what you add to your toolkit: 1) What do your users want? 2) What do your users need? 3) What do your users already have? Asking these questions can help ensure that you get resources that will be valued and useful to your service base. It helps, for example, to know if all your users have access to laptops already, because then you don't need to buy laptops.Make all resources seamlessly accessible. That means using tools that work together and complement one another instead of requiring multiple versions of a similar product for multiple platforms.Consider what you want to accomplish, and do that thing really well one way. Don't get bogged down in having three versions of a service--downloadable books, for instance--when having a single version will be simpler for users and staff.Strategies for Effectively Using Tech with KidsGive kids room to play. Don't hover over children using your tech supplies. Instead, let them explore how they work and use them in a way that feels natural to them. Dictating how to use a tech tool, or repeatedly saying things like \"Be careful!\" are going to serve as deterrents for kids who might otherwise use them.Provide options and variety. Not every kid wants to use laptops, and not every kid wants to do arduinos. Have different tech tools available to suit the needs and interests of kids.Take the tech where kids are. That could mean bringing a cart of laptops to a public space, like a school football game, so that folks are aware you have them. It could mean traditional outreach opportunities. It also means having tech available in the parts of the library that kids already use.Offer what is immediately relevant to your users. A great example is in sharing electronic resources with kids: talking about SAT and ACT prep resources to seventh graders is going to be a dead end because kids that age don't care about college test prep. Make sure you're sharing appropriate tech.Use all the bells and whistles to draw attention. Everyone has seen a laptop, but MaKey MaKeys? That's attention-grabbing. Generate interest by showing how your tech is interesting.Know your community and their access issues, and provide accordingly. This is an extension of making it relevant, and it can go two ways: 1) provide tech tools that build on what kids already have access to; or 2) fill in the blanks with tech that kids aren't getting anywhere else.Those were our major takeaways of our Savvy Tech Strategy think thank session. The discussion certainly left me with many things to think about. For details on what the Makerspace think tank group discussed, you can see notes taken by Justin Hoenke here."},

In case you're looking for some new tech tools to add to your library tablets, you may want to check out these two.App: Axel's Chain Reaction by Laura Allison Pomenta BadolatoPlatforms: iPad, iPhone/iPodContent Area: eBook, STEAMAge Recommendation: 7+Premise: Axel is the protagonist in this school story eBook. Axel isn't always successful at school; though he's definitely clever, although his mind wanders and he tends to get frustrated when things don't turn out how he wants them to. That combination of personality traits could result is disaster when it comes to the school-wide fair, where each child creates a project or invention. Axel does struggle a bit, but ultimately he learns just how much he can accomplish with his mind and his hands.     The app has fun interactivity throughout, which will add quite a bit of enjoyment and interest for children experiencing it for the first time. Bright colors and good pacing recommend the app as well.Potential Library Uses: As a shared read-aloud in a program; on in-library devices for customers to use on their ownApp: Literacy LevelerPlatforms: Android, iPad, iPhoneContent Area: Reading levelsAge Recommendation: All readersPremise: Help readers and caregivers identify the reading level of books using the ISBN scanning feature or text/author search feature of this app to identify the Lexile, DRA, and GRL of books. Not all books will include reading level information, so for those who need to find a book at a specific level, it's possible to search by reading level; these searches will return a list of fiction and non-fiction titles that meet the reading level needs of the searcher. This app is an excellent tool to have out in the stacks to help quickly identify reading level of titles--something that happens pretty much on a daily basis at my library. It's invaluable and getting better as more and more titles are added.Potential Library Uses: Reference"},

For the time being, however, I wanted to note a few big thoughts from Gretchen Caserotti's keynote. I'd love for fellow attendees to chime in in the comments!Quick Takeaways from the 2014 SLJ Think Tank Keynote by Gretchen Caserotti\"Fill your well.\" - It's important to take care of yourself, to do things that are for yourself, and to take things in and live in the moment. If we don't center ourselves first, we can never really focus on others. Taking care of ourselves is the first step toward excellent customer service.\"Avoid drama. Just because we work with young people doesn't mean we should act like young people. If we act like young people, we run the risk of being infantilized and not taken seriously as professionals.\" - Yes. Just, yes. We need to be mindful of always conducting ourselves as professionals and not get sucked into workplace/organizational/association drama that looks exactly like the gossip and fights our kids and teens have.\"You don't need to be a manager to be a leader.\" The two are not necessarily synonymous, and you can be an outstanding leader for your organization from any position. It's about doing excellent, transformative work and motivating/facilitating others to do the same."},

I very much enjoyed this novel, and I can't wait to book talk it to my teens.The Stats: The Black Butterfly by Shirley Reva Vernick, released May 27 from Cinco Puntos PressThe Synopsis: Penny's Christmas break is not going according to plan. Her mother, off on a ghost hunt in Idaho, has deserted Penny for the holiday and sent her to a bed and breakfast on an island in Maine owned by a woman she's never met. Things couldn't possibly get any worse, thinks Penny--until two unexpected things happen, that is. Romance and ghosts; they can turn any isolated holiday into an adventure.The Review: This book is highly enjoyable and hits all the right notes for a teen reader. Penny's voice rings so true, bouncing back and forth between anger, intrigue, excitement, gratefulness, and everything in between. The plot has great variety, too, with a few unexpected ghosts, slowly-revealed family histories, and the forging of new friendships. All of these aspects are well balanced, with nothing feeling out of place or overdone. The bed and breakfast is well-drawn, adding a great sense of place to the story. There's also a perfect amount of kissing in this book, which I, and many of my teen readers, enjoy.The Programming Connection: I'll be book talking this title lots in coming months, especially when the cold Maine winter will provide an excellent literary escape from the hot Missouri summer. I imagine my readers who enjoy Myra McEntire will be particularly pleased with this addition to our shelves.Digital review copy provided by the author."},

I also made some slices of onion, green pepper, and pepperoni (all some of my favorite pizza toppings, not coincidentally).I've found that this simple felt activity can be used in so many different ways.

This comprehensive title explores the spectrum of vegetarian eating and lifestyles, then dives into the details of how vegetarians--young girls in particular--can meet all their nutritional needs while making the food decisions they want. The title includes excellent resource lists as well as plenty of recipes to get any new vegetarian started going veg healthfully.The Review: Man oh man, I wish this resource existed when I was a middle schooler. It's completely accessible in its language, tone, and scope, always taking an individual's food choices seriously and never verging on condescending. I'm also quite impressed with the tips and ideas peppered throughout the text, including things like how to approach the school cafeteria or a restaurant menu when you're a vegetarian. The variety of recipes are outstanding, too.The Programming Connection: The volume would fit well in a teen program on food and nutrition, a topic of interest to a number of the teens who frequent my library.The Stats: Fly Away by Patricia MacLachlan, released April 8 from Margaret K. McElderryThe Synopsis: Lucy's family are a musical bunch, what with their listening preferences (opera for her dad) and proclivity for singing. Lucy doesn't sing, however, instead channeling her energies into poetry. When Lucy and her family travel to their Aunt Frankie's to help her during the river's annual flood, she encounters an aspect of nature than she's ever before experienced. She also learns the power of words and song when her toddler brother wanders away during the flood.The Review: In true MacLachlan fashion, this quick, spare story introduces a heartfelt, captivating character, her family, and her inner thoughts. Readers will hear truth in Lucy's insecurities, her need for a secret between herself and her brother, and her strong, strong love for her family.The Programming Connection: I could connect this title to STEAM areas in two different ways: with the flood connection (science of extreme weather), or with the poetry and music aspects of the book."},
{"title": null, "date": "Monday, April 14, 2014", "text": "Some of you may not know that I am a huge Jane Austen fan. My love of all things Austen doesn't come up that often here on this blog, as most Austen content is aimed at an adult audience. That changes today, however, as I review today's title.The Stats: Lizzy Bennet's Diary by Marcia Williams, released April 22 from CandlewickThe Synopsis: Elizabeth (Lizzy) Bennet and her sisters, living in Georgian England, have their lives just about turned to chaos when their mother learns that Mr. Bingley--a very eligible bachelor--has moved into the neighborhood. The social world of a single Regency woman revolved around marriage prospects, and Lizzy Bennet is no different. This book constitutes her diary, and it proves that all the marriage fuss doesn't mean Lizzy can't have her own opinions and interesting experiences along the way.The Review: Williams's diary-style interpretation of Pride and Prejudice is fair indeed. It keeps mostly consistent with the characterization from Austen's original--an important detail for me, since adaptations for younger readers need to represent everything that's excellent about the real thing. There are a few moments when Lizzy seems to think or say something that doesn't quite seem in character, but I attribute that to the liberties of changing a third person story to a first person internal narration. I've got no major complaints, which is a pretty big endorsement for me when it comes to an Austen adaptation.The Programming Connection: I'd book talk this title in conjunction with other diary-style novels, like the Dear America and Royal Diary series. It would also make a nice complement to a suite of historical novels.Review copy provided by the publisher."},

If you're looking to add another activity or two to your own April festivities, give one of these a whirl!Blackout PoemsAll it takes to create a blackout poem is a page from a book and a black marker. I've been mindful of what books I've had to withdraw for broken spines, missing pages, etc., and I set aside ones with \"juicy\" words specifically for use in this activity. In my program earlier this week, for example, pages came from The Blue Fairy Book and Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.Once you've got your page from the book, the process is to black out all the words you don't want to use with your black marker. It's almost like making poetry with negative space--choosing the gems of words you want to use in your poem, and getting rid of the rest. What's so great about this activity is that it truly focuses on what words can do. You can't add words, and you can't change word order--what's on the page is what you've got to work with.Book Spine PoemsI use this activity every year because it's so quick and fun. The premise is to find books on the library shelves, combine them with others, and use their titles on their spines to create a poem.

{"title": null, "date": "Monday, April 7, 2014", "text": "I've got a confession to make: I'm not doing such a great job as a reader right now.I suppose, in some ways, I have an advantage over other folks stuck in reading ruts because I know the probable cause of mine. I happily spent all of last year reading a ton, in a specialized and critical manner. And I know that I should give myself permission to take a break from reading for a while now that that intense reading year is over.But the thing is, I don't want to take a break from reading. I love books. I just can't seem to get into them right now, and that's really disappointing for me.I love reading a great book. I love getting to know the characters, inhabiting the world of the book. I love the surprises, the twists and turns of an excellent plot. I love great language, the conversation between characters. I love reading.I just can't seem to find the right book for me right now.Which has given me opportunity to think a bit about the readers' advisory aspects of youth librarianship. Namely, do we give kids space to be struggling as readers? Do we recognize, in the way we do our jobs, that a reading life is fluid? That it's not all the same all the time, with readers and reluctant readers statically on two ends of a spectrum?Because what my personal reading rut is affirming for me is that if there is a reading spectrum, it's spherical and we each individually move across and around it all the time. Sometimes our preferred genres may very; sometimes we may only want to reread favorites; sometimes we voraciously read anything we can get our hands on; and sometimes we just might not be able to get into anything at all. It's all normal. The reading life is a fluid one.So while I try to claw my way out of my own reading rut, I'm going to slow down in my readers' advisory interactions with kids to make sure I'm listening to what's happening in their reading lives, and to do everything I can to help them find the right book right when they need it."},

{"title": null, "date": "Wednesday, April 2, 2014", "text": "My adult services colleagues and I have been brainstorming ways to work together in my branch lately. One of the ideas we came up with was offering joint children's/adult programs--that is, programs for families that involve some overlapping activities as well as distinct spaces and activities for kids and adults. We had a few goals for these sorts of programs:Allow the caregivers to enjoy content geared to them.Provide thematic crafts/activities for kids so that caregivers need not find childcare to attend the adult program.End programs with an invitation for the family to continue the program exploration at home, whether through conversation or related activities.With those goals in mind, my colleague Michele and I offered our first joint programming endeavor earlier this week. It wasn't heavily attended--we still need to figure out how to best advertise this new style of program--but it was fun. Here's what we did:Recipe Swap for Kids and CaregiversThe joint activity: What's the herb/spice?     Michele created a poster board with images of 16 herbs and spices used in different types of cooking. She also created a sort of game page, with spaces to guess all 16 herbs and spices based on their pictures. For additional clues and interest, she also set out plates with all 16 of the herbs and spices. Smelling, carefully grating, and feeling the foodstuffs were all acceptable means of exploring what the herbs and spices were. The goal was for families to work together to explore these foods, talking about what they were, what they smelled like, what they use them for in their house, etc.     This hands-on and self-paced activity provided great ways for families to use food vocabulary and to talk about their own food traditions.The adult activity: Recipe Swap & Cookbook Exploration     The advertisement for the program encouraged attendees to bring a printed copy of a recipe or two that they enjoy at their own homes. At the beginning of the program, a library staffer ran off copies of each of the recipes for everyone to swap. There were pasta dishes, a breakfast sausage recipe, some baked goods, and a sweet and sour pork recipe, all with recommendations for their ease, healthfulness, and kid-friendliness.     Michele also called in and displayed a wide variety of cookbooks in the library's collections to share with attendees. They were then able to talk about their favorite recipe sources--cookbooks, blogs--and swap personal tips for the best stores for certain ingredients, keeping meals well-balanced, etc. So many caregivers try to be cognizant of the types of foods they share with their families, and so this topic produced tons of conversation.The kids' activity: Decorating Recipe Cards     I created a blank, half-page recipe card template in Publisher and printed a bunch on white card stock. I had the library's washable, large-size ink pads on the craft table, ready for kids to do fingerprint art to decorate the backs of the recipe cards. I also had plenty of wipes on hand for when the artists wanted to switch to a new color of ink.     The end result was a great variety of personalized, colorful recipe cards, ready to be used to share favorite family recipes. This craft is a pretty straightforward one for the crafters, so we were able to talk about our favorite foods and how we help cook and bake at home while working on our recipe cards.The wrap-up: Cookies!     Michele shared a recipe for chocolate crinkle cookies in the recipe swap, and she prepared a batch to share at the program as well. Kids and adults reconvened to try the cookies, which provided a nice end to our joint programming adventure.~~*~~Do you partner with adult services to offer simultaneous or inter-generational programs?

{"title": null, "date": "Thursday, March 27, 2014", "text": "Allow me to preface the recap of my recent Lost in Space program, inspired by an emergency program at the LaCrosse Public Library, with a string of possibilities:It is possible that you should decide to offer a space-themed unprogram during spring break. It is possible that 30+ highly energetic, highly imaginative children will attend. It is possible that one of said children will pretend he has concealed a space knife, which is mostly similar to a real knife, on board the spaceship. It is possible that said child will commit the first space murder. It is possible that a group of fellow space travelers will elect to create an ad hoc jury to bring said murderer to justice. It is possible that said murderer will be sentenced by said jury to be dumped into the atmosphere of Venus to fry in retribution for said murder. It is possible that all of these things will happen without any hint or suggestion from the librarian/space captain. It is possible that all the children/astronauts will find it highly amusing.You've been warned.Lost in Space!The introduction: As the astronauts assembled in the program room/spaceship, they each found a seat at a table, which had been assigned a pod number. These would be the astronauts' pods for the duration of our space voyage. While waiting for all the astronauts to arrive, podmates could play games of concentration using a deck of cards showing different spaceships, real and fictional.The connection to library resources: I the space captain gave initial instructions and explained our planned journey: to exit the solar system. I discussed the length of time which such a journey would take, and also shared a number of items available in the ship's library to pass the time. I book talked Zita the Space Girl, The Fellowship for Alien Detection, and What We Found in the Sofa and How it Saved the World. Then we segued to our in-flight movie, an Eyewitness DVD featuring information on the solar system. It was while we were watching a clip about Saturn that...MAYHEM! (or, the organized chaos of activity stations): The lights flickered, the tv screen went dark, and our ship crash landed on Titan, a moon of Saturn. Suddenly our primary goal was survival, which translated into a number of stations:Building Shelters - Luckily this moon seemed to be littered with LEGOs, which provided the building materials. I prepped small cups of LEGOs on a table, and the astronauts used robot hands to grab and carry them back to their pods, where building shelters could commence.Rations - An astronaut has to eat, so we rationed out some astronaut food--freeze dried ice cream.Staving Off Space-Madness - An assortment of brain-feeding materials were available, from books about space and space exploration, to stories about aliens, to the aforementioned spaceship concentration game.The wrap-up: After we finally figured out how to fix our spaceship, it was time to head home to Earth. As a group, we made sure our spacesuits were on securely, and we buckled into the ship. I split the crew into three groups, each responsible for part of the takeoff, flying, and landing process. Setting foot on Earth again after so much time away was wobbly, to be sure, but oh, did it feel good."},

This picture book chronicles how Michelangelo's David came to be, detailing why Florence wanted the statue in the first place, how hard the artist worked on it, and how it was received when it was finally revealed. The text concludes with an informative author's note and bibliography.The Review: This short, straightforward non-fiction picture book provides so much detail surrounding one of the most famous works of art in the Western world. Sutcliffe obviously believes that having the context for great works of art is integral to appreciating them, and she makes sure her readers understand why the David statue was and continues to be important. Shelley's illustrations add a great level of interest to the book, with intricate borders and side illustrations that depict every aspect of this statue's life--from the biblical inspiration, to the sculptor's tools, to the process of moving the enormous statue after its completion. Sutcliffe and Shelley combine to offer a comprehensive, interesting, and kid-friendly introduction to Michelangelo's marble masterpiece.The Programming Connection: I'd take either the art historical or the engineering/art routes for programming with this title. In terms of art history, this book lends itself to a program in which many famous works of art are explored for their context and how they were created. On the engineering/art side, I would use the book in a program about creating with negative space. We'd have blocks of clay to sculpt into our own creations by chipping away at the parts we do not need. Not a simple process!The Stats: Milo and Millie by Jedda Robaard, released May 27 from CandlewickThe Synopsis: This quick picture book follows Milo and his bear as they have a sailing adventure in an origami boat. At the end, the reader discovers the adventure was only an imagined tale taking place during Milo's bath. The book includes instructions for making an origami boat.The Review: This simple story comes beautifully to life in Robaard's watercolor, pencil, and collage illustrations. There is much to enjoy and appreciate here--the brevity of the text, which mimics a young child's storytelling; the gorgeous and minimalist illustrations; and the ultimate realization what we can imagine all sorts of adventures for ourselves. A lovely, quiet book to share with preschool-age children.The Programming Connection: I would absolutely use this book in storytimes, taking care to talk about the beautiful illustrations. On some pages, we could talk about shapes; on another, animals; on a third, what a whirlpool is. I would also love to use this book in a program in which the children can fold their own origami boats, then describe the adventures that they go on inside of them.~~*~~See February's STEAM Reads Roundup here."},

I also got a fair number of recommendations for simple felt stories that really pack a punch with kids. One of the most recommended was \"Little Mouse, Little Mouse.\"Readers, I was skeptical. You see, the entirety of \"Little Mouse, Little Mouse\" is a felt mouse hiding behind one of several differently-colored felt houses. When the mouse is successfully hiding, the entire group chants together: \"Little mouse, little mouse; are you in the *color* house?\" The person leading the story then pulls back the appropriately-colored house to reveal whether the mouse was hiding there or not. Simple.But, oh. The excitement! The cheers! The absolute disbelief when the mouse was not to be found inside a particular colored house, and then the absolute joy when it was discovered!The moral of this story is: Make this felt board. It is simple and straightforward from the creator's perspective, it reinforces color knowledge and ideas of object permanence, and kids completely adore it. I can still hear them chanting: \"Little mouse! Little mouse!\"Check out this week's full Flannel Friday round-up on Katie's blog Story Time Secrets."},
{"title": null, "date": "Wednesday, March 19, 2014", "text": "The 2014 PLA Conference in Indianapolis was a great one. I got to attend some outstanding sessions by dynamic librarians whose words are certainly feeding my professional development; I broke bread with a number of excellent library land friends and colleagues, some of whom I met IRL for the first time in Indy; and my presentations went off quite well. As I have come to do after conferences, I am sharing a recap and some of my greatest takeaways here on the blog in hopes that you might enjoy some free PD!First, the recap.I presented during three sessions in Indy. The first session was a SparkTalk, an extremely adrenaline-filled 5-minute-limit presentation with slides to a truly high-energy audience. I talked about tapping in-house expertise to provide more meaningful, more empowering, and less expensive trainings. Slide deck (possibly my favorite slide deck I've ever created) below:   Spark Talk: Guerrilla Professional Development #PLA14  from Amy Koester On Saturday morning of PLA, Brooke Rasche and I co-facilitated a Guerrilla Storytime. So many storytime providers participated in the session, and the result was fantastic skills sharing. I put together a full recap for the Storytime Underground.And last but not least, I filled in for Marge Loch-Wouters on a session about advocating for youth services at the library, community, state, and national levels. I wrapped up the session by sharing some tips for using social media as a tool to champion the work happening in youth services. Check out the Pinterest board that co-presenter Rhonda Puntney Gould and I put together to gather advocacy resources.The TakeawaysThese are the biggest, most services-transforming ideas I brought home with me from PLA. I truly hope you'll read the ideas, think about them, and start a conversation about them (preferably with me, but really, with anyone!). These are the ideas I want to think more about so that I can apply them to the work that I do in my library and career.\"Always assume there are queers in the room.\" -Joel Nichols     And that's why every storytime provider, every youth services librarian should mindfully make sure that their programs and readers' advisory suggestions aren't just propagating heterosexism. Even when you take away the books and programs that purport to appeal directly to boys OR girls (a restrictive binary in and of itself, and off-putting to many), there is a lot of background heterosexism in books. We owe it to the children and families we serve to not exclude anyone or make anyone feel uncomfortable or unrepresented, even unintentionally. I will most certainly be thinking about this topic much, much more, with respect to my library's programs and services and also to the profession as a whole. Suffice it to say, more on this later. Because it's big, and it's important.\"You were hired for your brain--feed it!\" -Megan Emery     In her most excellent, The Outsiders-themed SparkTalk, Megan talked about inevitable librarian burnout and ways to stay gold. Namely, she advises refreshing and restarting on a day-to-day basis. That, and doing the professional development you want to do and not just putting it to the side \"for later.\" Read those articles. Check those blogs. Have that convo on Twitter. Then, when you go work with customers, you'll be in a much more refreshed, informed mindset.\"You're not an asshole. You're saying things other people are thinking, too.\" -Julie Jurgens     I most sincerely hope that Julie will convert her SparkTalk into a blog post, as her viewpoint and message are much needed in library land today. Namely, that speaking out about the unbalanced, alarmist, and privileged attitudes coming from the librarians with public soapboxes can most definitely be commented upon and criticized--and should be, if we want to learn from it and change the professional culture for the better.\"Power pose before your next high-stakes interaction.\" -Amy Cuddy     Cuddy's TED Talk is one of my favorites of all time, and her live presentation explored the same concept: that intentional, physical posturing can cause beneficial physiological adjustments that allow us to perform better in difficult and stressful situations. Which can be every single day for librarians. I highly recommend taking some time to watch the TED Talk:~~*~~What were your biggest takeaways from PLA? Let's chat!!"},

Our session is titled Be a Champ! Effective Advocacy for Youth Services, and it's meant to inspire all manner of youth services personnel to use their storytelling skill set to advocate for their departments, their libraries, their customers, and themselves.Throughout our presentation, we're talking about a number of outstanding resources that can aid advocates as they go about their work. All of these resources, plus plenty more that we love and recommend, are available on our presentation Pinterest page. Rhonda, Marge Loch-Wouters (who was originally supposed to present with Rhonda, but, life) and I will continue to add to this board as we collect more resources. I do want to highlight a few key resources here, however, to get you started thinking about how you can be your best advocate.Advocacy ToolkitsAdvocacy University - From ALA, this compilation of resources covers everything from how to start being an advocate, to quotable facts about libraries, to strategies for advocating for different types and sizes of libraries.Pew Internet: Advocacy Tools for Librarians - This site, available through WebJunction, compiles all of those Pew studies that share quantitative data about the use and value of libraries.Turning the Page 2.0 - This online course from PLA is available in its entirety to get anyone started advocating.Youth Services Advocacy Facts, Ready to ShareColorado Libraries for Early Literacy - The CLEL advocacy page is overflowing with messages just begging to be shared with administrators, library customers, community members, legislators--everyone!Growing Wisconsin Readers - Use the excellent information on this site to help craft brief, powerful messages about early literacy and the work the library does to support parents as they help their children develop early literacy skills. Don't forget to check out the resources for librarians for even more good stuff.Advocacy SupportEveryday Advocacy - This initiative of ALSC gives ideas and bite-size advocacy projects that any youth services librarian--any librarian, really--can implement from the reference desk on any given day of work. This is a new initiative, so more content is added all the time.Storytime Underground - Looking for a community of folks with whom you can share, commiserate, and swap strategies for effective advocacy of youth services? Peruse the Storytime Underground, a community of youth services advocates who stand fully behind the expertise that is serving children in the library.Advocacy at a National LevelEvery Library - The only registered Political Action Committee (PAC) for libraries, Every Library has made a huge different in election campaigns that could have been severely damaging for libraries all over the country.National Library Legislative Day - Every year, library advocates descend on their elected officials to make sure they understand just how necessary it is for the communities they represent to have vibrant libraries--and how important it is that their votes reflect that reality.~~*~~What are you waiting for?

The most comprehensive array of programs on this site fall into the \"Art Explorers\" category--plenty of room for scientific method and asking questions to figure out how different styles of art work--but the handful of \"Time Travelers\" programs are great, too.STEAM Programming ResourcesScience Sparks - Looking for ideas for activities to add to your upcoming STEAM programs? Science Sparks has plenty of options for libraries looking to engage both preschoolers and school-age kids in hands-on exploration of science.What's STEAM, and Why Do it in the Library?What does STEM look like in preschool and what is STEM anyway? - This post on the \"Teach Preschool\" site is a bit older, but its content is great for anyone looking to justify STEAM or find age-appropriate STEAM activities for preschool programs. After she introduces what hands-on STEM is and why it's necessary for preschoolers' intellectual development, Deborah J. Stewart, M.Ed. gives some tips for folks who serve preschoolers to integrate STEM into what they do.Q & A with David Cole: Why We Need the \"A\" in STEAM - Cole, an educator and curriculum developer in California, succinctly summarizes one of the big benefits of adding that arts/creative aspect to the STEM content areas. Bonus: he also touches on that whole maker thing.NSTA Position Statement: Early Childhood Science Education - The National Science Teachers Association released their official position statement on early childhood science education--namely, what it is, what it should look like, and why it is absolutely vital if children will be able to reach their full potential in science once they start formal schooling.

As part of our festivities at my library, we hosted a special program: Read with a Police Officer.The premise of the program was to have a recognizable community figure come to the library to read a story aloud, talk about why they love to reading and why reading is important to them, and then answer kids' questions.Officer Ochs of the Lake St. Louis Police Department came to my branch completely ready to read--what else--Officer Buckle and Gloria. Officer Ochs is the police officer in our town who visits lots of schools and daycares, so she's well versed in dealing with kids. She even has her own copy of Officer Buckle and Gloria, as it's one of her favorite stories to share with kids.After she read Officer Buckle and Gloria to the kiddos in attendance--both preschool- and school-age--Officer Ochs talked about how she needs to read to be able to do her job, and that she enjoys reading stories for fun, too. Then she asked the children what they want to be when they grow up. As the kids responded (president! ninja! firefighter! musician! librarian!), she reinforced how important literacy is by mentioning that each and every one of these jobs will include reading.Officer Ochs's portion of the program wrapped up with a Q&A, with the kids asking her questions about her job. They asked some great questions: what's on her utility belt, and why is it included? what are the patches on her uniform for? how many bad guys has she stopped? The kids were absolutely riveted as they listened to the answers from a real, live police officer.I finished up the program by tying everything back to World Read Aloud Day and how much fun it is to share stories out loud. From there, the kids could add their favorite read-alouds to our celebration poster. I had die-cut books in a variety of colors, as well as lots of markers, for kids to write down their favorite stories before taping them to the poster. That poster is now hanging from the reference desk at my library, in clear line of sight of almost everyone who visits the library. Others can add their own favorite read-alouds to the poster, too.That's how we celebrated World Read Aloud Day at my branch library this year: with a community helper reinforcing the importance and joy of literacy right alongside me, the librarian. Kids had fun, shared stories, and then checked out books to read at home. All in a good day's work!How did you and your library celebrate World Read Aloud Day?"},

I'm excited to get to read more books that are strictly young adult this year, and Gurtler's novel was a great, fun book in this category.The Stats: 16 Things I Thought Were True by Janet Gurtler, released March 4 from SourcebooksThe Synopsis: Morgan is working at an amusement park during the summer before senior year when her mother has a heart attack. Morgan's already been having a tough summer--she lost all of her friends after a video of her went viral. When Morgan's mother, fearing death, finally tells Morgan the name of her father and where he lives, it's like Morgan's entire world has shifted. She wants to meet and confront her father, and she decides to road trip to Canada to do just that. Luckily she doesn't have to go it alone, as Amy and Adam, two of her amusement park coworkers, offer to be with Morgan along the way. Can Morgan deal with everything happening in her life?The Review: I loved how quickly I was able to get into Morgan's head, feeling her confused rush of feelings about her mother, her stranger of a father, and her friends (or her perceived lack thereof). The three major teenage characters really are well fleshed out, each complex enough to make the occasionally melodramatic plot interesting without weighing it down. Gurtler does a pretty good job with the pacing, too; while some conversations seem a bit hurried and could be more developed, the overall feeling of life moving at a complicated, frantic pace really mirrors Morgan's state of mind. 16 Things I Thought Were True will appeal to a variety of teen readers, as teens can see parts of themselves in Morgan--cynical, not as confident as she wants to seem--, Amy--cheery, unapologetically honest--, and Adam--well-meaning, trying so hard to be the excellent student and citizen he thinks people want him to be. There's lots to captivate in the road trip and personal drama plot, and plenty more to enjoy in the characters.The Programming Connection: I'll be book talking this title to teens during readers' advisory interviews and chats with Teen Advisory Board members. It would make a great addition to a book list of young adult titles with a road trip theme, too.Review copy provided by the publisher."},

Kathleen got in touch with me after she attended the Wild Wisconsin Winter Web Conference webinar that Marge Loch-Wouters and I gave on the topic of unprogramming. I admired Kathleen's enthusiasm for thinking about programs for kids, and I asked her if she'd be willing to share her thoughts and first experience with unprogramming. Today we get to hear about unprogramming from her. Take it away, Kathleen!This crafter dubbed his costume \"Obama Baby.\"The thought the costume prop hat was ababy bonnet, which of course prompted meto explain some of the colonial garb.The program I specifically used this approach for is called Expert Hour, which we started during Summer Reading Club of 2012.  This program began as a way to offer special programs focusing on the arts and sciences for older kids, sort of a workshop-type program during SRC.  We began with staff utilizing or teaching a special skill that they had, as well as a few paid presenters.  Prior programs have included illustration lessons, cake decorating, comedy improv, intricate crafts, and a juggling workshop.  We continued the SRC-only option during the summer of 2013, but we have now morphed the program and are offering it all year long. In the fall of 2013 and spring of 2014, we offer a Homeschool Expert Hour for kids age 5-12 at 2pm once a month, and an After-School Expert Hour for kids age 5-12 at 4pm once a month.February was my turn to lead the program, and I opted to incorporate history (a passion of mine) with traditional crafts and literacy elements.  February Expert Hour focused on the Presidents of the United States.  My original plan began with the dreaded powerpoint presentation.  There were to be lots of slides sharing information about the presidents past and present, some fun facts about several presidents, and a description of how one becomes president including facts about the election process.  I found a neat website that would allow us to take a virtual tour of the White House, and I planned to show that to the kids.  I had a craft in mind to add at least one element of what a typical program looks like: share some info, make a craft, go home.  Sounds really boring, right?  The more I planned, the more I got bored with my own presentation!  I was really at a loss as to how to make this fun for the kids.  I did not want to get trapped in the theory that history is dry, boring, and a total snooze-fest, much like I remembered it from school.  In fact, I didn’t want this to be like school; I wanted it to be fun!  I wanted the kids to see how much fun the library can be and how many cool resources the library has.  My original plan lacked both of these messages I wanted the kids to come away with.Craft StationFinished CraftJump forward to January and the 2014 Wild Wisconsin Winter Web Conference!  I heard about the conference ahead of time from reading this blog, and after reading the words “free” and “virtual” I decided to sign up. I’m so very glad I did!  I was really interested in Amy and Marge Loch-Wouters's presentation “Unprogramming: Recipes for Successful Programming with School-Age Children and Teens.” I wanted to know how unprogramming could work at my library.  How I could plan a program without spending weeks on it and pulling my hair out?  How do I incorporate ALL the THINGS with very little planning and stress???  I had my doubts.But, as I watched and listened to these two super-smart ladies explain the process, I had an epiphany.  I didn’t need to stand in front of the group and tell them stuff.  I didn’t need to hold their hands and lecture them on how history was cool.  I didn’t need to have everything so detailed and specific that the kids in attendance were being shown the information as passive bystanders.  I only needed to be a facilitator; the kids are smart enough and curious enough to be given some options and the discovery can begin with THEM taking the lead!  Brilliant!!Abe or George?I immediately reconfigured EVERYTHING.  I shortened my powerpoint to four slides, one of which was a breakdown of all the cool stuff there would be to do after I shut up.  I added a non-fiction read-aloud to begin the program as a way to present some of the information that was included on my previous slides.  I kept one slide with a fun fact (Grover Cleveland was the 22nd and 24th president. Technically we have only had 43 different presidents, although Barak Obama is considered to be our 44th president – cool, right?).  Our Children’s Director began to get excited about my plans and ordered a Presidential Bingo game from Oriental Trading.  She also ordered some costume props the kids could use: faces of presidents and colonial garb to play and experiment with.  I pulled all the books on presidents that we had to create a table display to encourage the literacy component and the hope that kids would take the books home.  I pulled a few laptops and set them up with different websites: the virtual White House Tours, a Colonial Williamsburg website with games to play, a National Geographic website with fun facts, and a Presidential Mad Lib type game.  I printed out some fun word games, coloring sheets, and writing prompts to create a ‘writing center.’ I kept the craft, but had it as yet another optional activity for the kids to do.  Now I had a program that included about ten minutes of me talking and lots of stations for the kids to explore on their own.Mad LibsI began the program reading If I Were the President by Thomas Kingsley Troupe and playing one round of the mad lib type game with the entire group.  I explained what activity stations were available and turned them loose.  Within minutes, I heard kids talking and sharing information with each other about what they already knew.  They began sharing their own ‘fun facts’ knowledge with each other!  They asked me questions about presidents they weren’t as familiar with. They tried to impress me with their knowledge, finding cool stuff in the books I had out.  They laughed at their own mad lib creations and wanted to share them with me.  They came up with some great ideas for what they would do as president: “All kids should be taken out for pizza on Friday nights by their parents” and “War should be illegal.” The boys were off laughing at the way they looked in the costume props area and the girls were giggling with each other while making crafts.  A studious young lady was so absorbed in the book display that I didn’t hear a peep from her until it was time to leave.  She wanted to make sure it was ok to check out five of the books (yes, of course!).  I heard a lot of “Whoa, I didn’t know that!” and “Hey, check this out!” and “That is so cool, look at this!”Presidential BingoAs I called the presidents' names for Bingo*, I looked around the room and saw engaged, happy, bright-eyed children having FUN.  And all it took was 20 minutes of room set-up (with a helpful volunteer) and 20 minutes of room clean-up (with a helpful coworker).  I spent more time planning than Amy or Marge probably would have, but it being my first attempt at this style I’m ok with that.  It was still MUCH less time (maybe two hours) than I would have spent using my old methods (days or weeks of planning).  But mostly, the STRESS was non-existent, or close to it.  I was worried there would not be enough to do – it turns out there wasn’t enough time!  I was worried this new style wouldn’t go over well – what a non-concern that turned out to be!  The kids had more fun during this program than many of the others I have planned and presented.  To me, that is the key – the fun, the learning, the discovery – that the kids can find for themselves when utilizing the unprogramming idea.  They did this, they were empowered, they were excited, they learned, they discovered, they experimented.  So much of what we do in the Children’s Library is focused on these goals – leading the kids to discover new things.  If I had planned and structured the program using my old methods, this discovery would not have happened the same way.  Success!!  Thank you Amy and Marge, for making my job more fun, easier, and less stressful.Writing CenterWriting Station*So as not to come away without at least one total fail, I share this story:  During the fun fact about Obama being the 44th President, one six-year-old boy states “He’s the devil!” upon hearing Obama’s name. Color me shocked!  Another boy, age 9, said “No he’s not.”  The first boy said “Well, he’s Muslim and that’s bad.”  The older boy said, “Well, actually, some of his family is Muslim, but Obama is a Catholic.”  I finally recovered from shock and said, “Ok, well moving on.”  During Bingo, one card was Obama and Mr. Six-year-old at the craft table beside us said “He’s a bad man!” while Mr. Nine-year-old and two others say “No, you are wrong.”  To avoid any further controversy I said “Regardless of what we think of the man, he is the President of our country so let’s be respectful of that.  There are deeper issues that reflect the political stances of each of our presidents, which we don’t really have the time to get into.  Let’s just say that Obama is our President and keep it at that for today, ok?”  Both boys seemed to be ok with this and there were no further incidents.  I should point out that this area of Arkansas is deeply conservative and very Christian.  I’m sure Mr. Six-year-old has overheard some lively conversations at his house and wanted to enlighten the group.  We were having a grand time of sharing information after all.~*~Guest blogger Kathleen Connelly-Brown's main duties include baby storytimes for ages 0-24 months, as well as tween programming for ages 8-12.

{"title": null, "date": "Friday, February 28, 2014", "text": "This February, my new ukulele song is one to which I found the chords after learning the words at a Guerrilla Storytime in Chicago. Illinois librarian Lindsay Huth was at that Guerrilla Storytime and shared one of her favorite songs for having the wiggles: \"Stick to the Glue,\" a rendition of \"Skip to My Lou.\" I wanted to use this song because it doesn't require everyone to stand up; in many of my outreach classrooms, there simply isn't room for all the kids to stand up for a wiggle song, so sit-down versions are my bread and butter.In this song, kids start out by pouring imaginary glue on their hands. Then, with each verse of the song, their hands get stuck to a part of their bodies (elbows, knees, shoulders, etc.). Kids can get out some energy after each verse as they have to use all their muscles to unstick their glued hands.When I've shared this song on the ukulele, I usually sing it first without the instrument to demonstrate how it goes and how the actions work. Once the children have that down, I'll pick up my uke and we get to jamming.Here are the chords I use for \"Stick to the Glue\":If you're interested in an alternate version of this song, check out Jim Gill's version, which is a bit more active and requires kids to stand up."},

The focus of the webcast is showcasing new and upcoming nonfiction from Gale, ReferencePoint Press, and Scholastic. I’ll link to the archived webcast here when it’s available, but in the meantime, perhaps you’d like to peruse some additional resources?As supplementary material to the webcast, Cathy and I are both expanding on some of the topics we’re sharing with attendees. Head over to Cathy’s blog, The Nonfiction Detectives, to get some context for the nonfiction we’re seeing published for youth today. Cathy and her co-blogger, Louise Capizzo, are veritable experts on this topic, and they have lots of examples and food for thought for understanding the nonfiction available now.I’m sharing some programming and classroom connections for titles mentioned in this webcast. I’ve connected a variety of titles from each of the three featured publishers to public library program options--so you can see how you can add these titles to your programming repertoire as well as your nonfiction stacks. Cathy shared some great info about how some of the titles can connect to classroom activities (I don’t go into as much detail here, as no one wants to see me pretend to know what school curriculum or a typical school day looks like in 2014).So check out Cathy’s intro to the types of nonfiction available for libraries serving youth; read up on some programming and classroom connections for specific titles; accessing the archived webcast when it’s available; and get using more nonfiction in your library. I’d love to hear what you’re currently doing with nonfiction down in the comments.Gale CengageIn the public library:The Book: Eye on Art: Walt Disney by Barbara SheenThe Program: Animation School-Age ProgramEvery librarian knows that Disney is big--and perhaps more so here in Missouri, Disney’s birthplace. So an animation program that has some Disney materials tie-ins will be popular. To create context around animation, I’d use Sheen’s book as well as the Disney Animated app (the 2013 Cybils winner for best app!). Then we’d get animating. If we have enough tablets, we could go high-tech and use animation apps for the iPad to create cartoons. Or we could go old-school and make flip book cartoons using markers and pads of sticky notes.The Book: Science Behind Sports: Cycling by Stephen CurrieThe Program: Sports and Simple Machines School-Age ProgramLots of sports equipment uses the principles of simple machines to help athletes perform well. In this program, we’d introduce the different types of simple machines and test them out at different stations. From there, we’d see either video clips or still images of athletes performing their sports, and then we’d try to identify how simple machines are at work. Currie’s title would add great context and examples to this activity. We would end with some hands-on, creative construction to try to imagine making our own sports equipment.The Book: Teen Rights and Freedoms: Bullying by David M. HaugenThe Program: Teen Chat & Chew: Bullying EditionMy library regularly hosts Chat & Chews for teens. These programs take the form of a book discussion, although there is no assigned reading leading up to the event. Instead, teens gather to enjoy some snacks and talk books. Teens share what they’ve been reading, and then the library staffer shares book talks for titles on a theme. Bullying happens in a huge variety of young adult titles, and it’s a nearly universal experience, so it would make a great topic for book discussion in a Chat & Chew. Haugen’s title can also add great context to these discussions and instances of bullying in books, allowing teens to see facts and legislation about bullying.The Book: Eye on Art: Public Art by Meryl LooninThe Program: Graffiti Art for TeensI’d share some examples of public art from Loonin’s book as well as some graffiti images (think Banksy) to get the graffiti juices flowing. From there, I’d designate a space--a bare wall covered with butcher paper, large glass windows--and hand out supplies for teens to create their own graffiti. We’d talk about keeping it appropriate if it’s going to be displayed, but I don’t see too many teens at a library program trying to get away with crude illustrations. I’d love to host this program in the lead-up to summer reading and have teens decorate on the summer reading theme.In the classroom:The Book: Hot Topics: Medical Marijuana by Kevin HillstromThe Classroom Activity: Supporting opinion with facts in both persuasive writing and speakingThe Book: At Issue: Drones by GaleThe Classroom Activity: Persuasive writing on a current event topic in social studies classThe Book: Opposing Viewpoints: Human Genetics by Louise GerdesThe Classroom Activity: Understanding different points of view in biology classReferencePoint PressIn the public library:The Book: Tattoos, Body Piercing, and Art by Kris HirschmannThe Program: Henna Tattoos Teen ProgramMany teens are drawn to tattoos for the artistic aspect, which means a henna tattoo program can be a huge draw. Hirschmann’s title allows the program to have just as much information as creativity. Share facts about tattoos as teens sketch their own designs and then get temporary henna tattoos.The Book: History of Rock and Roll by Hal MarcovitzThe Program: Music Club Teen ProgramMy library hosts a monthly teen music club. Each month highlights a specific genre or decade in music, allowing teens to both enjoy the music they love and hear music to which they’ve not been exposed. Marcovitz’s title can add a lot of context and interesting facts to a music club meeting, and I can see several of our die-hard musician teens checking it out for leisure reading.The Book: Life During the Roman Empire by Stuart A. KallenThe Program: Minute to Win It - Gladiator Style for Teens or School-age KidsEven if they aren’t familiar with the Minute to Win It television show, lots of kids and teens are drawn to game competition programs. The quick pace of Minute to Win It tasks (ideas here) keeps everyone interested. I’d throw a Roman Gladiators-themed Minute to Win It program, complete with an introduction about all the perils facing those alive in Ancient Rome--info that can be provided by Kallen’s title. Togas optional.The Book: How Serious a Problem is Computer Hacking? by Patricia D. NetzleyThe Program: CoderDojo for teens or school-age childrenMake a STEM programming connection and help teens and kids learn to code by offering a CoderDojo at the library. I would either use Scratch or Code Academy to introduce basic coding skills, and I would include facts from Netzley’s title to give context to the potential for coding skills to do both great and destructive things. We would of course talk about using our coding powers for good.In the classroom:The Book: Thinking Critically: Social Networking by Andrea C. NakayaThe Classroom Activity: Classroom debate on the school’s social media policiesThe Books: Life in the North During the Civil War by Jim Whiting and Life in the South During the Civil War by Diane YanceyThe Classroom Activity: Understanding different points of view in history class; Using first-person accounts to further understandingThe Book: The Future of Renewable Energy seriesThe Classroom Activity: Persuasive writing about current topics in science and politicsScholasticIn the public library:The Book: Monster Bulldozers by Chris BowmanThe Program: Preschool Construction PartyPreschoolers love to build, and they love the equipment associated with construction. Monopolize on those interests by offering a construction party program. Share plenty of nonfiction with great images, like Bowman’s book, to work in some great construction vocabulary, then let the construction begin. You can set out all the library’s building materials and let kids engage as they please, or you can follow a more specific program plan.The Book: Unexplained Mysteries seriesThe Program: Fact or Fiction? School-Age TriviaTake advantage of the common fascination with the unexplained and myths to put together a trivia program for school-age kids. I’d create a long list of possible questions on a variety of topics using the Unexplained Mysteries series as well as some Ripley’s Believe it or Not! titles. During the program, I’d break kids into teams and have them compete to answer each question as fact or fiction. Prizes may result, but bragging rights are great, too.The Book: You Wouldn’t Want to… seriesThe Program: Time Travel Adventures School-Age ProgramSet up a carnival-style program with several different games and activities stations. Each station would represent a historical time period, with the games and activities gleaned from this popular nonfiction series. Think pyramid-building tasks and mammoth- and whale-hunting skills. I would make sure to display titles from the different historical time periods alongside the activities, because so many of these little history factoids inspire interest and leisure reading.The Book: You Can Draw It! seriesThe Program: 12-Hour Comics Day for Teens or School-AgeI previously worked at a library that offered a variation on 24-Hour Comics Day, a worldwide event that encourages comic writers, artists, and fans to create a full 24-page comic in one day. I’d book the program room for an entire day and set out plenty of paper, pencils, pens, and coloring implements as well as tons of resources for crafting stories and drawing. The new titles in this You Can Draw It! series would assist comics creators in making comics around some of their favorite topics: mythical beings and cars.In the classroom:The Book: Blastoff! Readers - Exploring Countries seriesThe Classroom Activity: Using different text features to get all the information, in the school media center; Social studies country projectsThe Book: Cornerstones of Freedom: Gun Control by Steve OtfinoskiThe Classroom Activity: Persuasive writing or speaking assignmentsThe Book: Extremely Weird Animals seriesThe Classroom Activity: Animal research unit; Science unit on animal adaptationThe Book: Rookie Read-About Science: Acorn to Oak Tree by Lisa M. HerringtonThe Classroom Activity: Science unit on plants or the life cycle; Arbor Day activities~*~How would you use these or other new nonfiction titles in your school or public library?"},

They were looking for a STEAM perspective--specifically, programming ideas and examples for integrating STEM concepts into those \"traditional\" arts and crafts programs that take place at so many libraries. I LOVE the LAIP and was thrilled to say \"yes.\"My first post serves as something of an introduction to this idea of harnessing the STEM potential in arts and crafts programs. It's meant to serve as an introduction to the idea that there are STEM applications for arts & crafts activities. Readers of The Show Me Librarian are likely already familiar with this concept in theory, but fret not: from here on out, my monthly posts on LAIP will each highlight a specific program, ready to replicate in your library. These will be programs that at first glance look like straight arts and crafts programs, but which actually have tons of avenues for adding in STEM concepts, too.I hope you'll head over to LAIP to read my first post for them. Then stick around and browse all of their great content. It's a gold mine of ideas over there!"},

{"title": null, "date": "Monday, February 24, 2014", "text": "It's probably no surprise to anyone that a ballet-themed story time is a hit with our young program-goers; after all, how many young ones are in ballet and other dance classes, and how many more love the idea of dancing? And so a ballet story time is really a no-brainer. But what if you think outside the book when planning that story time and partner with a ballet professional in your community for an extra special program experience?That's what my library district has been doing this week. My colleague made a call to a ballerina with the Missouri Ballet Theatre, and before we knew it, a ballet dancer was scheduled to make a costumed appearance at storytimes at each of our programming branches. Since the real live ballerina is a huge draw for this program, that means restructuring the story time format a bit. Here's what we did.Ballet StorytimeWelcome & Introduction     I wanted to make extra sure that all our attendees had time to get into the program room, so I spent the first few minutes of the program time talking to the children (many of whom came in tutus and other fancy dress). We talked about who likes to dance, who takes dance classes, what they wear to dance, and who had been to the ballet. Lots of fans of The Nutcracker here.     When it was time to get started, I introduced myself and Miss Rachel, our ballerina from the Missouri Ballet Theatre who was in full Sugar Plum Fairy regalia. I also explained the format for our special story time.Story: Brontorina by James Howe, illustrated by Randy Cecil     This is truly a dance story of grand proportions: it's got dance, dinosaurs, worries about fitting in, and strong friendship themes. I did my read-aloud of this book standing up, which allowed me a larger range in sharing the illustrations--a necessity considering we had about 60 people show up for the program. There are a few pages that show Brontorina and her dance classmates doing a few ballet steps, and Miss Rachel demonstrated those moves so that the children could get an even better idea of what they look like.Ballerina Time!     After the story, Miss Rachel took over for a bit. She invited all of the children (almost all girls, with one lone boy who was equally captivated by the demonstration) to stand and try some ballet steps. The learned to stand in first position, to plié, to arabesque, and to relevé. They finished up their mini lesson with a combination--a short dance, if you will. There was plenty of excited ballet dancing going on.     After I had the children sit back down, they were able to ask Miss Rachel questions. Questions included how long she had been dancing, what are her favorite ballet roles, and questions about what moves she can do and how much she practices. Our lone male storytime attendee raised his hand last to ask if boys can be ballet dancers, and Miss Rachel happily shared how important male dancers are to ballet.Craft and Picture Time     Our event advertisement mentioned that there would be a photo op with the ballet dancer, and many a young friend was clamoring for just that chance. To help with crowd control and keep the line of children waiting to meet the dancer short, I also offered a simple ballet craft at the back of the room. I printed (and a volunteer cut) card stock ballerinas. I set these out with crayons and scissors, and also available were cupcake liners, which could be glued on with glue sticks to create tutus and dancing skirts (see finished craft in above photo). The children could do the craft then get in line for a picture, or vice versa, or any combination that worked for them. I made sure to have plenty of ballet fiction and nonfiction books by the photo op area, too, to encourage folks to check out a book and keep learning about ballet. Having two activities going at once definitely cut down on the waiting time for pictures with Miss Rachel, and it also helped us keep the program at the advertised 45 minutes.All in all, our Ballet Storytime was a delightful success. I saw several attendees leap and dance out of the library afterwards; I think that's pretty indicative of a meaningful library experience, when you are literally acting out the program as you head home."},
{"title": null, "date": "Friday, February 21, 2014", "text": "In continuing my 2014 story time resolution to begin creating felt stories, I decided to focus this month on creating a story using a book pattern. In choosing a story for this challenge, I looked to the box of books to consider for withdrawal on my desk. Dog's Colorful Day by Emma Dodd was in the box thanks to a few too many tears on the well-read pages. Srince I had to get rid of the book and wouldn't have a replacement for a while, I figured the tale would make a great felt story.Turns out that Dog's Colorful Day is something of a felt story staple. Search Flannel Friday and you'll see many a variation, which was incredibly helpful as I planned making my own pieces. In the end, I used this great printable pattern from MakingLearningFun.com. After printing and cutting out the pattern for Dog, I cut out my felt Dog using a somewhat freestyle manner (I had forgotten where I'd put my sewing kit and straight pins). I then cut out circular spots freehand. I was quite pleased with my final product, which involved my first foray into puffy paint. And every time I've used this felt story in outreach story times, it's been a crowd-pleaser. Month two of felt story goal: complete!Check out this week's full Flannel Friday round-up on K Leigh's blog Storytime ABC's."},
{"title": null, "date": "Thursday, February 20, 2014", "text": "One of the ways in which I plan to blog about books on this blog now that I'm post-Newbery is to focus on STEAM titles. That's books, both fiction and nonfiction, that have some sort of connection to science, technology, engineering, the arts, and math. Since I aim to read as many of these titles as I can in the time I've got, the plan is to share a roundup of my STEAM reads once every month or so. Reviews may be on the shorter side depending on the overall length of posts, but I hope they'll still give you the gist of how I'd use any particular STEAM title in my library.STEAM Reads - February 2014The Stats: Assorted titles from Bullfrog Books/Jump!, including Red (Glaser), Clownfish (Meister), Pumpkins in Fall (Schuh), Ants (Schuh), Lions (Lindeen), Bulldozers (Meister), Pigs (Dieker), and Fall (Dawson), copyright 2014The Synopsis: Easy nonfiction series on topics including animals, colors, seasons, and trucksThe Review: These 8\"x8\" volumes are full of rich, high-quality color photographs that illustrate each books topic in a beautiful and interesting manner. Combining simple informative text with a touch of narrative, these titles are excellent for young children looking for information on and pictures of favorite or new topics. Titles include simple glossaries and indexes.The Programming Connection: I'll be using these books to add nonfiction elements to story times, in preschool science programs, and as visual display elements in programs centered around relevant topicsThe Stats: Dinosaurs #1: In the Beginning... story by Arnaud Plumeri, art by Bloz, color by Maëla Cosson, released January 7 from PapercutzThe Synopsis: Indino Jones is a dinosaur expert, and he gets this graphic novel started by sharing some major dinosaur facts and records. The book touches on a range of dinosaur facts, exploring imagining the lives of a variety of different dinosaurs.The Review: The storytelling style of this fact-based graphic novel is peppered with dinosaur factoids, action, and plenty of humor to keep readers enthralled. It's not all strictly lighthearted dino chat, though, as real information comes through in the panels as well as the index and glossary. The lettering is a bit on the small side, but I don't think that will deter many young readers interested in dinosaur graphic novels.The Programming Connection: A great addition to displays of materials for check-out at dinosaur- and paleontology-themed programsThe Stats: Feathers: Not Just for Flying by Melissa Stewart, illustrated by Sarah S. Brannen, released February 25 from CharlesbridgeThe Synopsis: When we think of feathers, we tend to think only of flight and nothing more. In actuality, though, feathers serve many different purposes for the birds who have them, from providing protection and camouflage to acting as tools.The Review: This beautifully-illustrated book is a treasure trove of information about feathers, a nature topic that never fails to captivate children. The field journal-style layout gives readers multiple ways to engage with this title: as an introduction to the myriad roles feathers play in the natural world, or as a leisurely exploration of the beauty, diversity, and function present in such a simple thing as a feather. This title is part informative, part invitation to explore, and the combination will serve readers well.The Programming Connection: Offer a school-age program about birds and spend a good amount of time focused on feathers using this title. I'd pair it with high-resolution photographs from books about birds, and I'd include an open-ended craft utilizing feathers as an art medium.The Stats: Aviary Wonders Inc. Spring Catalog and Instruction Manual by Kate Samworth, released March 4 from ClarionThe Synopsis: The year is 2031, and birds are extinct in the wild. Luckily for folks with some spending money, however, that Aviary Wonders Inc. can offer custom-made birds with any shape, color, or function desired.The Review: For all the whimsy of the premise of this title, it's an extremely strong STEAM text. Samworth's illustrations are beautiful, but the value of this text extends far beyond aesthetics. Readers will chuckle upon reading the specifics of designing one's own bird--choose a beak! a tail! a style of wings!--but they'll really be learning plenty about birds along the way. Clever illustrations implore readers to consider the physical nature of birds with a critical eye, ultimately leading them to learn why different real-life birds look the way they do. Those short beaks or long legs serve a purpose, after all.The Programming Connection: This is a great title to share as an inspirational text in a program about birds, or really about any type of animal. It begs for children to be able to assemble their own bird oddities. In fact, I'd love to see this title adapted into book app format to really allow kids the opportunity to order their birds from Aviary Wonders Inc.The Stats: Behold the Beautiful Dung Beetle by Cheryl Bardoe, illustrated by Alan Marks, released March 11 from CharlesbridgeThe Synopsis: Dung beetles are so much more than just bugs who hang around animal feces. In actuality, they are tiny creatures who take advantage of a readily-available resource in a variety of ways.The Review: Who knew there were so many beetles vying for animal dung? That's exactly what young readers will discover in reading this book. There's a whole insect world focused around eating, moving, and utilizing animal dung, this title demonstrates that the small dung beetle has much to captivate us. The text is handled quite well, with larger font denoting the major facts and paragraphs in a smaller font adding more detail (these paragraphs could be left out in read-alouds without limiting the book's efficacy). With some particularly great turns of phrase (\"Clad in splendor, dung beetles ascend into our world.\"), this book is surprisingly interesting and never stoops to using obvious poop jokes.The Programming Connection: This title will make a fascinating, non-traditional addition to story times about bugs (move over, hungry caterpillar!), and it would be an attention-grabbing element of a school-age program on entomology.The Stats: Wild About Bears by Jeannie Brett, released March 11 from CharlesbridgeThe Synopsis: There are eight species of bears living on earth today, each with distinct attributes and habitats as well as a few commonalities.The Review: After giving a basic introduction to bear physical traits and behavior, this title shares simple, fact-packed descriptions of the different types of bears that exist in the world. Sun bears and sloth bears get just as much page space as the more common polar and brown bears, and each illustration boasts a few additional pieces of interesting bear trivia. Each bear is identified by scientific name, common names, and size, making this title a strong starting resource for reports on bears. Back matter includes a world map showing where different bears live as well as a glossary of different habitats.The Programming Connection: I'll make this title available for check-out after sharing Florence Minor's If You Were a Panda Bear as a read-aloud, as Brett's text goes into more detail and depth and can truly inspire interest in bears of all kinds.Review copies provided by the publishers."},

{"title": null, "date": "Monday, February 17, 2014", "text": "I've had a growing number of children asking me about Arthurian legends of late, so I decided to put together a program centered around the topic. I only played a part in half of the program, as I brought in a fencing instructor from the community to share some great weapons presentations. I love being able to tap the community for outstanding and interesting program content. Here's what the school-age program looked like.Knights of the Round TableTraveling back in time through swordplay     I arranged with a local fencing instructor and one of his friends/students to bring an assortment of weapons so they could demonstrate fencing at different times in history. To get the sense of traveling back in time, they opened up by briefly explaining how modern competitive fencing works: the equipment, where you're trying to stab your opponent, safety, etc. After demonstrating modern fencing, they moved back to the Renaissance period. They switched to Renaissance-style swords, talked about duels and the Three Musketeers, and did a bit more fighting. Last was a demonstration of Middle Ages fencing, with broadswords and a unique style of fighting. After the explanation and demonstration of Middle Ages swordplay, kids were invited to ask questions. Tons of hands shot up, with children interested in knowing more about the differences between weapons, excited to feel the heft of an armored gauntlet, and to hear from real swordsmen what it's like having a sword fight.Storytelling: Sir Gawain and the Green Knight     Sir Gawain and the Green Knight is one of my all-time favorite Arthurian legends, and I've found that it's a lesser known tale to children just getting interested in Camelot. I told the story as oral storytelling--out loud, from memory without a book, just as the tale might have been told in halls and at feasts in King Arthur's time. I prepped for the storytelling by reading through several books on Arthurian legend from our nonfiction stacks; there are plenty of versions and editions of these tales available, and you can find one to suit your audience and timeframe. I love storytelling in my programs, as kids always get totally engaged in the story.Activity: Creating Armored Shields and Straw Swordplay     When I was at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in NYC last year, I stumbled upon a family art activity in the hall of armor where kids could use heavy-duty, art-quality foil sheets to create their own armor designs. I adapted that activity for this program. I had out on the craft tables sheets of aluminum foil and card stock shield-shaped templates for every child. Children cut out their shield shapes, then wrapped them in aluminum foil to create a relatively smooth shield the size of a hand. With the armor plating in place, kids used the ends of paint brushes to etch designs into their armor. Once the design was complete, a pipe cleaner put through the shield served to create a strap to keep the shield firmly in place on the hand. I handed out drinking straws to serve a swords, and kids went at it fencing with one another and defending themselves with their hand shields.Time for Further Questions and Materials Exploration     The fencing instructor was generous in supplying time and materials for this program. As the program was winding down, he made himself available for questions and his fencing equipment available for kids (and their just-as-interested caregivers) to touch. No children actually wielded a sword, but they got to feel how heavy they were and see their designs up close--plenty of excitement in and of itself. I also made available a bunch of books with Arthurian subjects. The Gerald Morris Knights' Tales series are a particularly easy hand sell thanks to their action and hilarity.~*~Have you worked with knowledgeable people in your community to put on interesting collaborative programs?

Check out the gallery of some of the final products:Roses are red / Violets are blue / I hate poetry / I love bacon and you!I had around 20 kids in this program creating art, and they were all particularly talkative and eager to talk about their work. I love these informal conversations that take place while hands are busy doing other tasks, and I'm always able to get the conversation focused on books. Since this particular program was centered around Valentine's Day, we talked about books we love. I stuck a large sticky note on the wall to encourage kids to share the books they love, and several of them obliged.Open-ended creation and talking books: a great way to spend an afternoon at the library."},

{"title": null, "date": "Friday, February 7, 2014", "text": "It's been a long, cold, snowy and icy winter here so far, with no sign of the weather improving anytime soon. It's no wonder that the little ones visiting the library are feeling antsy--they've been cooped up for weeks with little space for running around! What better reason to offer a library program that rich with play and that exercises gross motor skills and fun muscles* at the same time?That's what we did at my library for our toddlers and preschoolers, and boy oh boy was it a hit! I set up a number of \"obstacle\" activity stations throughout our program room, and after an initial welcome and some stretching to loosen up, the kiddos were free to play at whatever obstacle stations they pleased. The obstacle options were:Small Tunnel - I set out a medium-length, see-through tunnel for kids to crawl into and roll around in. Of course they found additional ways to use the tunnel, too, including as a vertical tube of \"hiding\" and as a chute down which to toss balls.Big Tunnel of Awesome - This zig-zaggy tunnel was created from four big furniture delivery boxes that I saved when my branch got some new meeting room chairs in the fall. I pieced them together with the help of a colleague and some book tape, and the boxes fit well while also allowing mid-tunnel \"secret\" exits in case any child had an in-tunnel freak out. Never fear; the children were completely in love with the Tunnel of Awesome. I witnessed some pretty stellar play happening in and around this tunnel, my favorite of which was a little girl pretending to be a little pig while her dad was the big bad wolf. The power of play to connect to literacy, anyone?Hoop Jumping - I set five hula hoops on the floor so the kiddos could jump from hoop to hoop.Parachute with Foam Balls - Some of the children had fun playing with the parachute; some with the foam balls; and some with the parachute and balls together. In addition to the motor skill action here, there was plenty of chatter about colors.Sack Hopping - With a set of jumping sacks and a duct tape alley drawn on the carpet, children worked on not only hopping, but also figuring out how to get in and out of the sacks. I demonstrated plenty of silly ways to get in and out of those sacks, too.Baby Station - Even though the program was geared for toddlers and preschoolers, I knew baby siblings would be in attendance as well. I set out one of our story time rugs in a corner of the room, and on there I placed our soft blocks and two wooden play centers. This station was a perfect congregating point for caregivers with their little ones, while still within easy view of the action of the rest of the room.Drawing Station - In the midst of all this running around and gross motor skill development, I thought it prudent to include a drawing station to provide downtime and some fine motor work. With crayons and paper set out on tables at the far end of the meeting room, I invited kids to draw pictures of their own imaginary obstacle courses. The results were pretty great, and I loved getting to hear the kids talk about what they were going to build at home.Our program was originally scheduled for just 30 minutes, but I didn't have a problem with families opting to stay a bit longer. Everyone was just having so much fun! I also set out a number of books from our non-fiction collections that focus on at-home and rainy-day games for young children. I had a number of outstanding conversations with caregivers throughout the program about the benefits of all these gross motor movements and the importance of play.When it comes down to it, there's no need to feel more cooped up in winter that we absolutely have to. And there's nothing quite like running a bit amok to emphasize that.An excellent rendering of an imaginary obstacle course.*I can't believe I just used the term \"fun muscles.\""},

I've reviewed a few of his hilarious non-fiction offerings in the past, so I'm excited to review his new title, a rhyming fiction picture book.The Stats: Peter Panda Melts Down! by Artie Bennett, illustrated by John Nez, released February 11 from Blue Apple BooksThe Synopsis: Peter Panda is your average young child who loves whatever it is he's doing--until something goes wrong and he melts down. Luckily Mama Panda is there to help him move beyond his tantrums, and to show him that melting down is something that happens to everyone every once in a while.The Review: I love Bennett's dexterity with rhyming text. His lines are always a joy to read, and they roll off the tongue like in the best of rhyming picture books. This particular story also includes a fun, repeatable refrain: \"Uh-oh. Here it comes. Here comes that frown. Peter Panda melts dowwwwnnn!\" It's a line that will be tons of fun for young readers to recite during the story. I couldn't help smiling whenever Peter began to have one of his meltdowns, as they feel so genuine in how they occur. Peter apologizing for making his mom melt down rings very true, too. Nez's illustrations, which are big and bright, depict the action of the story along with the text, giving this title great potential for read-alouds and one-on-one sharing with a child.The Programming Connection: I'll be using this title in story times for sure. I'll also include it in book displays at ECRR and other parent story time workshops, as this would be a great title for parents to share with their kids to talk about feelings and work through difficulties transitioning between activities.The Giveaway!I've got a copy of Peter Panda Melts Down!

STEAM experiences allow children to develop understanding about how the world works. At the most basic level, these sorts of experiences introduce children to new vocabulary, content knowledge, and narrative skills that are an integral part of early literacy. The more a child experiences, the more a child knows; and the more a child knows, the more a child will be able to recognize and process when it comes to reading. STEAM is important.That's why I created a guide to STEAM for these families with young children. The guide resembles a handout on the five early literacy practices that accompanies my library's early literacy calendars, so it's a format with which my library families are familiar. The guide explains what STEAM is, notes how it's important, and gives fun, simple activity ideas that families can do together to promote STEAM experiences and learning. I've found that parents really enjoy having a handout that gives them a running start when it comes to literacy-positive activities with their kids. These sorts of guides plant the seed for parents, and they empower parents to find the early literacy potential in every day. If I can accomplish that in my library, I consider my work successful."},

In conjunction with that webinar, I want to prompt you, dear reader, to think about unprogramming and to point you toward some resources to help you make it work for you at your library.To unprogram, ask yourself...How does what I'm doing in my program connect kids and teens to:a book or booksan author or illustratorthe library and our servicessome aspect of kids' and teens' interests that can connect back to the library?That's the key question for the key part of unprogramming: the library connection. The answer to this question can be incredibly varied--which is great, because that means your unprogramming options are pretty near infinite. You can aim to connect kids to award-winning books. You can aim to connect teens with your graphic novel collections. You can connect kids to their fascination of disasters and draw resources from throughout the collection. Possibilities for a starting point to unprogram are endless, and your programs are guaranteed to fit library goals when you start with this question.The unprogramming recipe...Marge is best at conveying the simplicity that is unprogramming, and so I will defer to her wording here.So you want to unprogram...Hooray!

{"title": null, "date": "Monday, January 13, 2014", "text": "Ever since Marge at Tiny Tips for Library Fun blogged about her library's after-hours reading camp-in--twice! she's blogged about it twice, that's how great it is!--I've wanted to offer a similar program. This past Friday, I gathered my supplies, arranged for a coworker to stay after hours with me, and finally offered my own take on the program. Here's how we did it.Family Forts After Hours5:30 p.m. - Arrival, Snack, Stories     My library closes at 6 p.m. on Friday nights, and I wanted our program families to be in the program room while the rest of the library was getting cleared out for the night. Thus I started the program a half hour before the doors would be locked.     As families arrived in the program room--sheets, pillows, and blankets in tow as recommended by the program description--I passed out cups of walking s'mores. I've used this treat before, and it was successful once again. (Recipe: Mix together a box of Golden Grahams, a bag of mini marshmallows, and a bag or two of chocolate chips. Stir.) As the families munched on their treat, they found spots in the program room for the introductory activities of our evening.      I shared two stories that worked very well to bridge the large age range of our attending children: Jon Klassen's I Want My Hat Back and This Is Not My Hat. Admittedly, these are two of my favorite books to read aloud--I like to think I add a certain over-exaggerated drama that really makes the story funny for all ages. The stories did not disappoint in this program, as the kids' gasps and laughter made clear.5:50 p.m. - The Rules     With ten minutes to go before closing, I handed out flashlights to the kids (leftover prizes from summer reading) and explained the rules. Additional building materials were available at the back of the program room: disposable tablecloths, fabric remnants, and floor cushions were ready for the taking. I explained that books could not be taken off the shelves for building forts--but they could be taken off the shelves for reading. I also reiterated a perennial library rule: use walking feet at all times.6:00 p.m. - Family Fort Building and Reading     Once the customers and other staff were out the door, the families took over the library and carved out spaces for their forts. I would estimate, from my wanderings around the library, that most forts took about 10 minutes to construct. That left plenty of time for in-fort reading, and I was beyond thrilled to see the families engaging in reading together. In some forts, siblings took turns each reading a page or two. In others, mom and daughter browsed through a princess book together and talked about the pictures. This was reading gold, people. Library win 100%.6:45 p.m. - Fort Clean-up (in anticipation of a surprise final activity)     I used the library's PA system to announce that it was time to start cleaning up forts. After supplies had been put away, everyone was to report to the information desk for the final activity announcement.6:50 p.m. - Lights Out Hide and Seek!     Hoots of excitement accompanied my announcement that we would wrap up the program with lights out hide and seek. I gave each family a single glow stick bracelet, and I explained that the person with the bracelet would be the hider. It would then be the job of the rest of the family to seek their hider. Once found, the hider would surrender his or her bracelet to the successful seeker, whose turn it became to hide. This strategy of creating teams, so to speak, worked really well. Sure, there were plenty of glow bracelets seen throughout the various library hiding spots, but seekers couldn't be sure until they got close whether they had found their hider.     I turned off the overhead lights that illuminate the library stacks for our game, which left safety lights as well as illuminated areas at the front of the library. No one fell or stumbled, so the arrangement seemed to work well for our size group.7:05 p.m. - Goodbyes     Everyone was having such fun at lights out hide and seek that I let them have an extra five minutes before bringing the program to a close. Lights came back on, and I thanked everyone for coming as they gathered their fort supplies. I let all of the families out of the library at the same time so that no one would be trying to avoid cars in the parking lot--instead, everyone got to their cars safely at the same time.This unprogram was incredibly low-intensity for staff and attendees: low planning and minimal cleanup, with very high literacy connection and enjoyment. I highly recommend modifying it so it can work for your library!"},

The signs I created on behalf of the library feature what I hope will be some bits of inspiration for folks enjoying a winter walk. Using our library databases, I put together two different signs: one inviting hikers to look for three different birds native to Missouri this time of year; and one exploring the science and poetic beauty of snowflakes.Click the image to enlarge.The recent snowstorms prevented me from getting pictures of these signs in place out on the trail, but hopefully these images will suffice. I am thrilled that we're using library information sources to create a sort of mini-exhibit, full of images, information, and tips for using the library for further exploration of these topics.Do you have any winter outreach to your community?"},
{"title": null, "date": "Monday, January 6, 2014", "text": "Our first Saturday morning story time of the new year was a great way to start off 2014--lots of energy, plenty of dancing, and bucketsful of smiles. Luckily our program preceded the bad, bad weather by about twelve hours, meaning plenty of children and their families were able to make it to the library to participate. Here's what we did:Opening Song: \"Open, Shut Them\"Books to read!Story: Dinosaur Kisses by David Ezra Stein     What a wonderfully silly story. When Dinah the dinosaur hatches from her egg, she tries out all sorts of actions, including kisses. Yet a dinosaur has a hard time achieving a gentle kiss, and Dinah accidentally chomps, stomps, and whomps several unfortunate animal friends in her efforts to show them affection. Luckily, another dinosaur with Dinah's exact skill set is hatched, and the two hit it off. Literally.Song: \"We Are the Dinosaurs\" by Laurie Berkner     We enjoyed plenty of stomping around to this song, including holding our arms close to our sides to give ourselves tiny t-rex arms. All of the kiddos had a ball trying to \"stop and eat our food,\" as the lyrics direct, with those tiny arms. The song ends with plenty of roaring, so of course it is a hit.Song: \"The Shaker Hop\" by Carole Peterson     I handed out egg shakers to everyone so we could all get boogying to the Shaker Hop. The song starts off like the Hokey Pokey, with shakers moving in and out, but also offers free dance breaks throughout the song. We spent our dance breaks shaking like we were animals in the ocean and like astronauts in space. Lots of imagination and vocabulary here!Props to add to the fun!Puppet/felt Story: \"I Know an Old Woman Who Swallowed a Fly\"     A colleague who used to be an elementary teacher gifted to me her puppet set for this story, and I made some velcro cards with the story's animals on them to provide further visual interest. While I started telling this classic cumulative tale on my own, the children soon picked up on the format and cheerily joined in. And, to demonstrate that children think statements like \"Perhaps she'll die!\" are funny rather than macabre, they had plenty of fun shouting that recurring line.Song: \"Sleeping Bunnies\" on the ukulele     I will share full details of this ukulele tune, including my chord sheet so you can play it yourself, later this month. It was a complete hit, and I am indebted to Jbrary and Miss Mary Liberry for mentioning it a few weeks ago on Twitter.Story: If You Were a Panda Bear by Wendell and Florence Minor    This rhyming text explores several different types of bears, some of which are familiar to young readers and a few that are not. My kids enjoyed identifying the distinguishing features of the different bears in our reading of the story, and quite a few bear roars could be heard throughout the telling.Song: \"I'm a Little Teapot\"     The song cube landed with the teapot illustration pointed upward, so we sang this song. I was informed by a young girl that we needed to sing it a second time, \"and do the other side.\" Okay then.Song: \"The Peanut Song\"     This short, silly rhyme was a great way to wrap up our story time on a zany note. Lyrics and hand motions here.Milk & Cookies Time!Free Play Time     While our varied play stations included two types of blocks, magnetic writing boards, shape sorters, and our wooden garage/car set, the hit of the morning was the puzzle table. A group 5- and 6-year-olds worked together to solve a large 24-piece alphabet puzzle, at which point they decided (without ANY prompting from me!) that singing the alphabet song would just be the icing on the cake. Which they did, and it was. Then they asked me to get a harder puzzle, and they successfully assembled a significantly more difficult 64-piece picture puzzle with a bit of help from me. The visual literacy and problem solving skills that went into that play time were substantial."},

I'm sure you can imagine my utter delight upon reading that Kate DiCamillo has been named to the post!Kate DiCamillo DisplayI was so delighted, in fact, that I spent the first 20 minutes of my shift both putting together a Kate DiCamillo display in my library (half of her books are already checked out!) and loudly sharing the news with my colleagues.All things considered, I have not been a librarian for a particularly long time. One thing that has been consistent throughout my stint in librarianship, however, has been my propensity to introduce readers of every ilk to Kate DiCamillo's books. Her oeuvre truly spans that amorphous zone embodied by \"young people's literature.\" She has books for emerging readers, and books that challenge older readers; books beloved by both boys and girls; books that make you laugh until milk comes out of your nose, and books that make you feel all of the feelings. My kids always come back to rave about Kate DiCamillo books after I put one in their hands. The Library of Congress and Children's Book Council name a National Ambassador for Young People’s Literature every other year. The ambassador's task becomes raising \"national awareness of the importance of young people’s literature as it relates to lifelong literacy, education and the development and betterment of the lives of young people.\" I have no doubts that DiCamillo is up to the task.See the National Ambassador for Young People's Literature website for full details on selection criteria, DiCamillo's credentials, and the calendar for DiCamillo's tenure as Ambassador."},
{"title": null, "date": "Wednesday, January 1, 2014", "text": "I've been giving some thought to my goals for library services in this new year. Last year was all about STEAM in so many ways, and I'll continue to spend considerable time on my own STEAM initiatives as well as promoting STEAM at conferences in 2014. What I decided, though, as I reflected on the fact that 2013 birthed the Storytime Underground movement, is that my story time skills could use some expansion.I gave that general goal some thought, keeping in mind that the heavy majority of the story times I provide happen at large outreach locations and thus have few story time \"extras\" (i.e., parachute, shakers, bells). What I came up with were two monthly tasks for myself to both spruce up my story times and push my librarian skills, as well as a goal to better use the plethora of resources out there in libraryland.My 2014 story time goals:1) Share a new (to me and my kiddos) ukulele song every month. That'll be a total of 12 new songs added to my repertoire by the end of the year. Since I'm the sort of person who needs a chord sheet in front of me in case my mind fizzles out come story time, I'll be putting together simple lyrics-and-chords sheets and sharing them here on the blog (copyright permitting, of course).2) Create and use a new felt story every month. My personal felt story collection currently consists of a store-bought Little Red Hen. It's an okay, generic set. With plenty of encouragement and tutelage from the fantastic folks at Flannel Friday, however, I am embarking on a journey to create 12 felt story sets that work with the way I tell stories.3) Pay better attention to the resources being shared by outstanding story time librarians, and go beyond just bookmarking them \"for later.\" I'll keep a close eye on Anne's Instant Professional Development series, for example. And I'm ALWAYS grateful to see the storytime badassery that Cory links to at Storytime Underground.With some thought and hard work, I'm going to make my 2014 story times even better than their 2013 cousins. If you've got tips to help me achieve these goals, I'd love to hear them in the comments or on Twitter. And love and support to you as you aim still higher for your own library services this year!"},

Regardless of where you weigh in on that particular argument--whether you want wider recognition, whether you don't, whether it's the principle of the matter--Cory's piece is a must-read. THIS is the sort of article that should be in American Libraries Direct, because then all sorts of librarians would read it. But this is the sort of article that never gets linked for all librarianship to read.So many librarians are doing good work for the communities they serve; that accolade is not reserved solely for youth services librarianship. But when factors like privilege, race, and sex prevent the good work in the children's room from getting equal recognition to all the shiny new trends? That's a serious problem, for our profession as well as those we serve."},

{"title": null, "date": "Monday, December 23, 2013", "text": "Ever since I first read/listened to Lemony Snicket's The Composer is Dead, I knew I wanted to one day use it in a program. In my mind, The Composer is Dead is on a level with Peter and the Wolf in terms of using narrative to introduce instruments in the orchestra. Better, even, because MURDER. It just so happens that this book fits well with the Unprogramming model that Marge and I have been chattering so much about as of late. Which is great, because who wants to spend a million years creating a program when you can make something truly engaging and fun in a much shorter amount of time? Here's what we did:The Book Component: The Composer is Dead by Lemony Snicket     I read the story aloud, but I added peripheral elements that made the telling interactive and visual for the kids in the program. When kids entered the program, I passed out instrument cards on popsicle sticks. Each card showed a picture of an instrument featured in the story, its name, and the section to which is belongs (strings, woodwinds, brass, percussion). Then, each time a particular instrument or section was mentioned in the story, the children holding those cards would raise them up and shake them feverishly. I also put together a Prezi to accompany my reading; I mirrored the Prezi from my iPad to the HDTV in our program room, providing visual intrigue throughout and visual clues for what instruments were being featured.     Fun fact about sharing this story with kids: The kids loved the premise that the composer has been murdered, and every section of the orchestra must be questioned to find the culprit. Toward the end, when the grand joke of the whole book is revealed, there's a whole two-page spread on which composers are listed, then immediately proclaimed, \"DEAD!\" The kids got really into shouting \"DEAD!\" after I named the composers, and they were particularly amused to see portraits of these composers, too (Thank you, Biography in Context!).The Activities Component: The Orchestra app by Touch Press     We had just over a dozen children in this program, a perfect size for exploring this really great app together. This app allows you to find out more about individual instruments in the orchestra, including 360-degree views, interviews with players, orchestra excerpts, and sound samples. We explored one instrument from each section of the orchestra, making note of the different ways things are played (buzzing like brass players was a particular favorite activity). We also tried to figure out the instrument that can play the lowest note, and the instrument that can play the highest. Favorite instrument sound for this group: the tam tam.     We finished this activity by watching and listening to part of a performance of an orchestral piece. These performances show, in real time: the score, so we talked about reading music; panning clips of different instruments when they were featured in the piece; constant video of the conductor; and a great illustration showing dots for every player in the orchestra, with the dots expanding whenever a particular player plays. That illustration was particularly captivating to several of the kids.Explore!: Make rubber band instruments     I brought all sorts of recycled plastic and cardboard containers into the program, as well as tons of rubber bands (which are always in large supply at the library). After demonstrating my own rubber band instrument, and showing how tightening or loosening the tension in the rubber band can change the sound, the children go to work on creating their own instruments.     We wrapped everything up with a short rubber band orchestra performance, which garnered rather a lot of applause from the attending caregivers. (They may have just been happy that rubber band instruments are quieter than that time we all made homemade kazoos, which are loud.)Take things home: I put out other Lemony Snicket books, some nonfiction about music and instruments, and a few orchestral CDs. Several parents asked me about The Orchestra app, as a few of the kids stayed after the program to try out a few more instruments on it.I was incredibly pleased with this unprogram. The kids enjoyed the longer story, they got into instruments and making their own music, and overall we enjoyed an evening of culture at the library on a cold night. Lemony Snicket may say something sarcastic here about the program, but I was pretty proud of it."},
{"title": null, "date": "Friday, December 20, 2013", "text": "I've been offering a monthly Kids Advisory Board program for about nine months now. The program is successful in essentials--a variety of kids ages 9-12 attend, we talk about books, we talk about what programs they want to see happen in the library, etc. The only problem is that, despite there being a variety of kids who have attended so far, only 2-3 children ever show up at any given program.I've tried personal phone calls to past attendees as a reminder of upcoming meetings. I've tried all manner of promotional signs around the branch to recruit new members. None of it has worked, and so I think a rebranding is in order.Really? You thought that program name would work?When I brought up this issue at the December Kids Advisory Board program, both the attendees--one female, one male (if that even matters)--were totally on board with the idea of a name change. According to these children, nine- to twelve-year-olds don't always associate with the term \"kids\" anymore. In their experience, \"kids\" means young children, 2nd grade and younger. So calling the program the Kids Advisory Board is potentially missing my target audience. They also told me they don't identify with the word \"tween,\" and that if some age signifier absolutely needs to be employed, they prefer \"pre-teen.\" Also, I was informed that \"advisory board\" sounds like work and not fun.So, \"Kids\" is out. \"Advisory Board\" sis. What to call this group, then?I've been playing around with different program names that may somehow reflect the fact that this is a social group for older elementary students, and that books and library happenings will be discussed. Here are some of the names I'm considering, culled both from pre-teens' suggestions and my own browsing of library event listings and blogs:The Idea SquadBooks and MoreLibrary ClubChatterbooksDear reader, do you possess insight or advice on this topic? Do you have a similar type of group/program at your library, and what do you call it? Do you have a good suggestion? Or may just an example of when you've rebranded a program to give it a new look? I'd love to hear any and all thoughts in the comments or on Twitter."},

Last year we did gingerbread houses, which is a wonderful STEAM program. Gingerbread houses will be back next year--I want to stay away from too many annual programs so we still have plenty of time to try new things. This year, we put on a Nutcracker Tea Party, which was a raging success. Here's what I did:Program advertisement: Come dressed in your tea party finest to enjoy the story of The Nutcracker and some festive treats. Before we're through, we'll decorate magic wands and dance like sugar plum fairies!Program supplies:festive treats (I got mine at Trader Joe's, which always has small, fun, inexpensive goodies that you don't see at every grocery store)drink options (I had both hot peppermint tea and cold juice drinks)a copy of the story of the Nutcracker, either for a read-aloud or for oral storytellingmusic from The Nutcracker ballet by Tchaikovsky, and a way to play itsupplies to make magic wands: chopsticks, stars on card stock, crayons, crepe paper, and book tapeProgram audience: ages 3-6, or preschool (siblings of children falling in that age range may also attend)Room setup: On the large side of our room, I created two long banquet-style tables by setting several of our moveable tables end-to-end and covering them with bright-colored tablecloths. Each place setting was set with a napkin and a small plate with pre-portioned treats (I kept ingredient information for interested caregivers), and crayons and scissors were set along the middle of the table for our craft.     On the smaller side of our room, I set out our story time rugs to delineate our story space. I also set a table against a wall to use as our craft assembly station. Our CD player was on this side of the room.Program schedule: The entire program was 45 minutes.Welcome: When I opened the doors to our program room, I had each child check in with me before finding a seat. I took that opportunity to welcome and compliment each child on his or her lovely attire and how confident it made them. This was also when I passed out each child's drink. Every child could choose a cold juice or a hot peppermint tea; about 5 of the preschoolers opted for tea, which is more than I would have expected. I also had a stack of flyers for a January \"ballet story time\" sitting on the welcome table; almost every caregiver picked up a flyer.Tea party snacks and chat: As the young partygoers enjoyed their treats, I moved from table to table to talk with each of my guests. Some were shy and just nodded demurely at my questions, but others were eager to tell me all about their party clothes, or their holiday plans, or the upcoming snowstorm.Story: We headed over to the story time rugs for the read-aloud of The Nutcracker. I used the version by Susan Jeffers, which has great illustrations and is an appropriate length for a preschool group.Craft: I handed each child a card stock star after the story, and everyone moved back to the tables to decorate and cut out their stars. I helmed the craft assembly station at this point, asking each child what color streamer they wanted for their wands. The star and streamer were book taped to the top of a chopstick for an easy, inexpensive craft.Dancing: Our final activity was to dance like sugar plum fairies with our wands! I cued the CD to the Trepak, the energetic, Russian-style dance from Tchaikovsky's Nutcracker. The children had lots of fun dancing however they wanted, with some twirling, some jumping, some marching, and some leaping about. To help bring down our somewhat chaotic dancing to finish the program, I invited all of the children to follow me into the library for a Nutcracker parade. Our single-file line went out one program room door, past the circulation desk, through the children's area, and back in the other program room door, at which point I invited everyone to find their grown-ups and thanked them for coming.Reactions: So many parents thanked me profusely for offering a program like this in the winter. Several said that their children love to get fancy, but they just don't have many opportunities to indulge that. My coworkers said they appreciated the Nutcracker parade, as it allowed them to enjoy seeing the excited preschoolers all dressed up. The reactions to this program were overwhelmingly positive, which is saying something when your final attendance count is 50+ attendees. We'll be doing  a variation on this program again in the next few years, that's for sure."},

This volume promises to be a useful introduction for those children who are new to the Minecraft world--and to their parents, who are often a bit baffled by the whole thing.From Tiger Tales: I Can Do It! by Tracey Corderoy, illustrations by Caroline Pedler, March 2014     What librarian hasn't heard a child loudly exclaim, \"I can do it!\" in the library? It's a universal experience of childhood: wanting to do things for yourself, but everyone rushes to do them for you first. I expect this title will make a great addition to our \"Growing Up\" neighborhood in our picture book section, and it will be a welcome title for families experiencing assertions on independence.From Simon and Schuster: Noggin by John Corey Whaley, April 2014     I cannot wait for my teens to get their hands on Printz-winner Whaley's newest book. The story follows Travis Coates, a teen with cancer, who chose a drastic treatment option: have his head removed and cryogenically frozen, then reattached to a donor body when the technology exists to do so. Travis thought it would take decades for him to wake up, but when he comes to just five years later, the landscape of life is rough. He's still 16, but his best friend and girlfriend are both 21; his parents have lived five years without him. How will he cope with this new reality of existence?

You see, that Saturday morning program has been consistently popular, filling my meeting room to the max. It just so happens, however, that our new children's dvd shelving couldn't be delivered last week as planned, and so all of our children's dvds are currently on tables in the back half of the meeting room. That meant coming up with an alternate plan for the story time, snack, and play time of my program.Except then it turned out to be about 15 degrees outside Saturday morning, with a windchill just north of 0. The prospect of venturing to the library on the first frigid morning of the year was apparently unappealing, and my attendance numbers dropped to a minimalistic 13. Happily, that more intimately-sized program was completely doable with the temporary meeting room logistics. We were all in closer quarters than we might usually be, but everyone professed to having a great time.December Milk & Cookies Story MorningWith this smaller group, I asked the kids if they wanted me to read from a chair or to sit on the carpet with them. They chose carpet, so I grabbed my first book and we got started.Story: Six Little Chicks by Jez Alborough     This rhyming book is quite a bit of fun, with a story that builds in anticipation as a mother hen worries about a fox in the chicken coop. There are a selection of animals whose noises you can mimic, there are opportunities for counting, and there are great spots for movement as kids copy the little chicks. The illustrations are bright and big as well, making this book a good choice for groups. I had quite a few kiddos helping me to finish the rhymes throughout the story.Song: \"I Know a Chicken\" by Laurie Berkner     I passed out egg shakers to our group--we had enough for every child to get two eggs--and we got really into the shaking of our eggs according to the song's instructions. One little girl in particular was way into some interpretive chicken-egg dancing, which helped get some of the more shy kids into the groove.Story: Theo's Mood by Maryann Cocca-Leffler     This book finds Theo at school on Mood Monday, and his teacher asks what happened over the weekend and how he feels. Theo shares that his mom just had a baby--a new baby sister--but that he doesn't know how he feels. His classmates help give him options of moods--happy, mad, jealous, proud, sad, and afraid--and ultimately Theo figures out how to express all the feelings he has as a new big brother. The pace of this quick story is perfect for inviting kids to uses their faces to express their different emotions; \"Show me your afraid face\" got some especially great facial reactions. This story explores a range of emotions in a safe, heart-warming way, illustrating that it's okay to feel all sorts of different things. I love that this story really shares vocabulary for the variety of things a preschooler might feel on a daily basis.Song: \"Grey Squirrel\"     Our song cube toss landed on \"Grey Squirrel,\" so I handed out egg shakers once again to serve as acorns to our squirrels. To my great enjoyment, many of the dads in attendance got into this song with their little ones. Shake your bushy tail!Story: The Little Red Hen by Byron Barton     I think this version of The Little Red Hen is one of my favorites--the illustrations are just so kid-friendly. Together, we shared this story and acted out what the little red hen was doing, and at the end we talked about why it's important to help other people. Or hens, as it were.Fingerplay: \"Zoom, Zoom, Zoom\"     I found this simple fingerplay/song on Jbrary (don't you just LOVE them?!?), and I knew I needed to add it to my story time movement repertoire. It has easy hand motions throughout, and it includes counting backwards from five as well, helping to solidify those numeracy skills. Plus, what kid doesn't like to do sound effects for \"Blast off!!!\"?Song: \"We're Going to Kentucky\"     We sang this favorite a few times through, making sure to get a little bit faster and sillier each time.Chant: \"Form the Orange\"     With just two minutes left in story time, I pulled this chant out of my back pocket; a quick scan of the room reminded me that none of the children in attendance had heard me lead the rhyme before! We made some orange juice, mashed some potatoes, and went bananas. As one does in story time.Milk & Cookies Time!     On the menu was 2% milk and cinnamon alphabet cookies from Trader Joe's. I love handing out cookies that providing an opportunity for letter and number recognition, too.Free Play Time     With our more limited space for play this month, I pulled out just three sets of toys: large building blocks, our wooden cars and garages set, and a new alphabet puzzle. Several of the kids got really into solving the 24-piece puzzle, and we ended up finishing it, taking it apart, and finishing it a second time. I'll definitely be bringing out this puzzle again in future programs; it's great for letter recognition, vocabulary, visual problem solving, and cooperation as we solve the puzzle together."},

Brannen, February 2014     This picture book for elementary audiences looks to be both gorgeous and informative. Feathers have long been used for a variety of purposes, both aesthetic and otherwise, and this picture book looks perfect for readers eager to explore collections and natural objects.~~*~~Look for Part IV, the final preview recap, next week!"},
{"title": null, "date": "Tuesday, December 3, 2013", "text": "We've got a set of shelves in the children's area of my library that serves as a display space. My coworkers take turns populating these shelves with themed displays of their choosing, and the space has seen plenty of different display topics. We've had Picture Book Month, National Poetry Month, seasonal themes, award winners, focus on animals and science, focus on picture book biographies...lots of displays meant to highlight interesting and often lesser-known parts of our collections. These displays usually do pretty well, but occasionally one soars above our expectations. That's the precise case with my colleague Erin's most recent display: \"I don't remember the title, but the cover was red...\"This cheeky display theme works on quite a few levels. For kids, it's visually pleasing to see all these like-colored books in one place. The color also tacitly ties into the current festive mood without connecting explicitly to any one holiday or tradition.For caregivers who like to check out our displays for new book-sharing ideas, the title elicits quite a few chuckles. What reader hasn't before encountered that exact experience of remembering nothing about a book besides its cover? The humor of this display works because readers are 100% in on the joke.The display is eye-catching for sure, and it looks like it piques customers' reading interests as well: 20% of the items on the display have checked out in the few days this December display has been up. Let this serve as a reminder to me that a touch of humor can go a long way in recommending books to readers."},

See also: Part I.From Chronicle Books: Here Comes Destructosaurus! by Aaron Reynolds, illustrated by Jeremy Tankard, April 2014     I cannot wait to share this picture book in my outreach story times. It combines two of my favorite children's lit people: Aaron Reynolds and his terrific storytelling, and Jeremy Tankard and his bright, energetic illustrations. My guess is that this story about losing your temper will be a huge hit with young readers.From Macmillan: The Pout-Pout Fish Goes to School by Deborah Diesen, illustrated by Dan Hanna, June 2014     My preschoolers love the Pout-Pout Fish, and I have every reason to believe they will clamor for this newest addition to the series. The best part: it's premise of sea creatures going to school makes it a perfect hand-sell for all those kids who only ever check out Finding Nemo.From Abrams: Pure Grit: How American World War II Nurses Survived Battle and Prison Camp in the Pacific by Mary Cronk Farrell, March 2014     Just yesterday I had two different kids ask me for \"good books about World War II,\" and while there are plenty of great titles available now, two aspects of the war still trail a bit behind: the Pacific theater and women overseas. This middle grade nonfiction text looks to do a lot to rectify that deficiency, and I anticipate that its combination of a captivating historical story--nurses who not only see battle but are captured--and archival photographs will entice readers.From Sourcebooks: When Audrey Met Alice by Rebecca Behrens, February 2014     Audrey is the first daughter, and she finds the security restrictive and the entire experience isolating. Until, that is, she discovers the diary of Alice Roosevelt, another first daughter who had a knack for mischief and a good time despite the expectations of her family. This middle grade novel looks to combine great hijinks with a premise of figuring out how to be yourself--even when you happen to live in the White House.From HarperCollins: Panic by Lauren Oliver, March 2014     This new standalone novel from YA favorite Lauren Oliver will have a substantial holds list, of that I'm sure. Its author isn't the only point of appeal; the thriller plot with strong storytelling would also do the trick, as would the fact that the rights to the movie have already been optioned by a major studio.~~*~~Look for Parts III and IV over the next few weeks!"},

Over the next few weeks, I'll recap what I saw at the preview event by sharing one book or series per publisher that I look forward to getting into the hands of the young readers I serve next year.From Cherry Lake: What's It Like to Live Here? series by Katie Marsico, January 2014     This six-book series aimed at elementary school readers brings the social studies home, literally: by reading about what it's like to live in a city, a fishing village, a mining town, a small town, a suburb, and a farm, children will gain perspectives on the variety of ways and places people live.From Sleeping Bear: Hot Dog! Eleanor Roosevelt Throws a Picnic by Leslie Kimmelman, illustrated by Victor Juhasz, April 2014     When King George VI and Queen Elizabeth visited the United States in the summer of 1939, it fell to first lady Eleanor Roosevelt to decide how to recognize the event. In true Eleanor style, she decided to forego pomp and circumstance and instead host a picnic. This cheekily illustrated nonfiction picture book for older elementary students looks to combine history and great biographical personality.From Scholastic Library: American the Beautiful, Third Series, beginning in February 2014     It's been over five years since Scholastic last updated their series of state books, and they are in as high demand by young customers as ever. The combination of useful maps and illustrations, strong text about many aspects of each state, and the updated material make these titles must-haves for my library. All 52 titles will be released in 2014, with the first batch coming in February.From Houghton Mifflin Harcourt: Hooray for Hat! by Brian Won, May 2014     I love both hats and a bit of whimsy, and this picture book about animals who find a remedy for their bad days looks like it'll be filled with both. It appears this book will make a great story time addition, too.From Penguin Young Readers: This Star Won't Go Out: The Life and Words of Esther Grace Earl by Esther Earl, Lori Earl, and Wayne Earl with an introduction from John Green, January 2014     Esther Earl was a huge fan of YA author John Green, and her fight with and ultimate death from cancer provided some inspiration for Green's bestselling The Fault in Our Stars. This memoir includes snippets from Earl's own journals and letters as well as stories from her parents. A must for YA collections.~~*~~I'll have more previews of 2014 titles next week!"},

{"title": null, "date": "Wednesday, November 20, 2013", "text": "I was lurking in a Twitter conversation between Brooke (@berasche) and Kendra (@klmpeace) yesterday. They started out talking about read-alouds for older kids--around 3rd grade--and while that's a terrific topic for a future, more serious post, I was completely drawn in when one of them mentioned this fact of librarianship: she couldn't share such-and-such book because it would make her cry.The scenario goes something like this. We start off reading great books (and showing kids the pictures, ahem):Then, seemingly out of nowhere, something about the story blows up the dam and we lose it:At which point it's all gasping breaths, snotty nose, wiping away tears, and trying to regain composure:And maybe trying to turn the whole thing into an early literacy moment by talking about feelings.Yep, that's what we're talking about: books you can't storytime* because you'll end up in tears. I'm about to share mine, and I hope you'll feel free to share yours as well--on your blog, in the comments, on Twitter, etc. What read-aloud stories make you cry, and why?And, without further ado, the children's book that reduces me to a puddle of tears:Charlie the Caterpillar by Dom DeLuise -- Charlie is a wee caterpillar who just wants to play with the other animals. Yet they all turn him away in disgust, saying cruelly, \"We don't play with ugly caterpillars!\" That line--even just thinking of that line when I'm still on the first page!--gets me every time. Every. Stinking. Time. Of course the story ends happily and it's a great tale of being friendly and not judging by appearances. But I only get to share that message if I can stop sobbing long enough to actually read the thing.*why, yes, I did just use \"storytime\" as a verb."},
{"title": null, "date": "Friday, November 15, 2013", "text": "We're coming to that time of year when I would normally share some recommendations of my favorite books from the year, both for the sake of recapping the year in reading and for aiding those holiday gift-buying decisions. Committee work prevents me from doing so this year, however, but do not fret! As an alternative, I will be highlighting two resources you might consider when you want to a) find a book perfect for that niece or nephew; b) have handy lists at your reference desk for readers' advisory inquiries; or c) have a resource against which to check your library's shelves in order to make sure you've got great stuff in decent condition.The SpotLit Collection, a new feature from Scholastic, offers librarians, teachers, and parents curated \"best books\" lists for preschoolers through middle schoolers. The lists were created by teachers, librarians, children's literature professors, and other experts, and perusing the lists demonstrates that these folks knew what they were doing when they created the lists. Each grade level list includes fiction and nonfiction, with a wide variety of genres and styles represented. For libraries looking to update or start offering grade-level booklists to customers, SpotLit is a great place to start. The suggestions are heavy on a variety of award-winners, too, as evidenced by this nifty info graphic:The second go-to resource to consider is ALSC's recently-updated Graphic Novels Reading Lists. There are three different lists available for libraries to print in color or black and white: kindergarten through second grade; third through fifth grade; and sixth through eight grade. These lists feature both stand-alone and series graphic novel titles across a spectrum of appeals, so helping kids find the right graphic novel for them is streamlined. The lists come in the form of pretty snazzy-looking brochures, too.What are your go-to resources for finding holiday gift books, making recent recommendations to customers, and spot-checking your collections?"},
{"title": null, "date": "Wednesday, November 13, 2013", "text": "One of my favorite takeaways from the Missouri Library Association Conference in October was the idea of a sensory blanket, which Stephanie Smallwood--Early Literacy Specialist at Springfield-Greene County Library District--shared in her session focused on outreach. I asked Stephanie to elaborate on her texture blanket, and she graciously agreed to share details in the form of this guest post.~~*~~\"What should I do with my baby?\"Families are always happy to learn that the best thing they can do with their littlest ones is talk to them. We know that talking to babies not only builds vocabulary and background knowledge, but also that all-important caregiver-child bond that is so important for all aspects of development. But sometimes we just don't know what to say to those little guys! Especially during the first few months, it can be difficult for new parents to know what to say to their child, so it helps to give them a conversation-starter so to speak.  We do that when we tell adults to talk about what they are doing or to describe everything they see, but there are certain things that babies are particularly drawn to. One of these things is textures.A newborn is very sensitive to touch, and that sense stays strong throughout the baby years. This is good for adults, because there are lots of words to use to describe textures. We can use a variety to describe how they feel (fluffy, scratchy, rough, smooth), and we can compare and contrast familiar textures (\"This denim feels just like Daddy's pants,\" \"Grandma has a blanket that has satin edges like this.\"). So textures give us an opportunity to use a copious amount of words, and since baby's sense of touch is so sensitive, they are particularly open to learning at that moment. You know that wide-eyed look babies get on their faces when they are particularly interested in something? That is the most important time to talk. They are focused, interested, and their minds are especially open.Stephanie's Texture BlanketI use lots of homemade early literacy activities in my work with families, and one of the most popular is the texture blanket.  It is a basic fleece blanket with several different pieces of fabric sewn on it. Babies love it, toddlers love it, caregivers love it, and every time I use it with a family I get to show them that wide-eyed \"That is so cool!\" look on their baby's face. It is an excellent tool for modeling those simple interactions that are so important to a baby's development. Here are some points I make with families and babies of different stages.Newborns: Choose the softest fabrics on the blanket to use with the littlest ones, they will be very sensitive to anything rough. Lightly touch baby's arm or hand with the soft fabric and talk about how it feels. Remember, newborns will be ready to move on in a relatively short time, so no need to overdo it.Tummy Time Crowd: This blanket is so fantastic for tummy time, I can't fully express it in a post. You really just have to watch a baby doing it. Babies doing tummy time have something to feel and look at while they lay on their tummies. As they start creeping and scooting, they have a goal to reach for and explore. Talk about the different textures they touch.Sitters/Crawlers: So much to explore! This is when we really start to see curiosity come through with babies. Sitting on a texture blanket gives them a big area to move around in and so many different things to examine. And yes, they will examine it with their mouth, so make sure your fabrics are secure and that babies are monitored.Walkers: Even those bigger babies will still appreciate the textures. Take off their shoes and let them feel the fabric with their feet. They are beginning to make stronger connections between current experiences and things they have experienced in other situations, so this is a great stage to compare textures.My texture blanket gets used pretty regularly in my outreach programming, but it would be ideal for baby storytimes or a baby corner in a children's department. Mine has been used monthly for three and a half years and is still in pretty good shape. It gets machine-washed after each use, and I line dry it. One of the great things about the texture blanket is that it is that it is portable--it is super easy to roll it up and take it to any of the locations where I work with families. It's truly a perfect activity!~~*~~Picture provided by Stephanie Smallwood."},
{"title": null, "date": "Monday, November 11, 2013", "text": "November marks my ninth monthly Saturday morning Milk & Cookies Story Morning, and the program looks to have developed quite a following. Month after month, I see a combination of familiar faces who express total excitement at the prospect of story time. I also continue to see plenty of new faces, usually accompanied by caregivers who tell me how grateful they are to have a Saturday library program option for their little ones. When I was in library school, one of my professors advised that any new program should be given at least a 6-month trial before deeming it successful or not; nine months in to Milk & Cookies Story Morning, I feel I can start to say that this program is something much needed and appreciated by the community I aim to serve.Opening Song: \"Open, Shut Them\"Story: Tiptoe Joe by Ginger Foglesong Gibson, illustrations by Laura Rankin     This simple rhyming story invites audience participation, so we all stood up to follow Joe, a bear, as he tiptoed through the forest to share a secret with his friends. Page turns bring a new animal to identify, including a fun sound for the animal's footfalls. These animal sounds just beg to be acted out, and the kiddos are happy to oblige. Discovering Joe's secret at the end of the story doesn't fail to delight, either. Give kids some space to stand up and have their feet make different sounds when you read this one--a perfect opportunity for play.Song: \"Bluegrass Jamboree\" by Hap Palmer     Since we were already standing for the preceding story, we kept standing up to dance along to this song. It includes simple, fun actions as the song lyrics, and the strong beat of the song helps pump up enthusiasm.Song: \"I Can Shake My Shaker Egg\" by Mr. Eric and Mr. Michael     After passing out shaker eggs, I explained to the kiddos that we would try to shake our eggs along to the beat of the song--if the song was slow, we would shake slow; and if the song was fast, we would shake fast. The dramatic increase in tempo of this song set to a classical music staple provides a perfect background for reinforcing rhythm.Story: There's Something in My Attic by Mercer Mayer     Before I started this story, we talked about a few things. First, where in a house is an attic? Did anyone in attendance have an attic at their houses? We also talked about how things can happen in stories that cannot happen in real life. When I've got some younger kids in a program in which we're going to read a story that might be interpreted as scary, I always talk about how these stories are made up and that pretend things can only happen inside the pages. By the time we got to the end of the story, kids were twirling their pretend lassos with nary a nightmare fear in sight.Song: \"Five Little Ducks\"    Our song cube landed with the illustration of five ducks facing upward, which meant we would sing \"Five Little Ducks.\" We all practiced showing numbers on our fingers, and we had great fun making big, huge quacking noises to bring the little ducks back home.Story: The Gingerbread Man by Beatrice Rodriguez     The simple, sometimes-silly illustrations in this version of The Gingerbread Man are quite delightful lend plenty of opportunity to talking about the pictures. Most of my attendees had not heard this folktale before--a fact that doesn't shock me as much as it used to, that kids aren't familiar with classic tales. By the end of our reading, though, they were reciting the refrain with me like pros. I've said it before, and I'll say it again: these folktales are classics for a reason, and their pacing and building of suspense are often exquisite. That, combined with the fact that kids need a basic knowledge of these tales to understand many, many things in life, is why I always strive to include a folktale when I can.Rhyme: \"Five Little Monkeys Sitting in a Tree\"     Together, we sang and told the story of the five monkeys in the tree and the alligator using Marge's terrific sign language version. Even the younger kids in the group caught along on several of the signs, and the excitement of seeing that alligator's jaws open wide was quite thrilling.Milk and Cookies Time!     We enjoyed Teddy Grahams and either 2% milk or 100% apple juice. I've learned to pour just a bit of drink in each cup to start in order to minimize both spills and waste.Free Play Time     Our four play stations for the day took advantage of the early literacy play kits currently residing at my branch for November. In addition to our perennial favorite wooden garage-and-cars station, we had foam building blocks; play fruit that can be slices with a play knife, a pencil, or other thin implements; and a variety of magnets (alphabet, dinosaurs, vehicles, animals) with magnetic boards. This variety of play items worked well with the age range of attendees. While younger kids veered toward the blocks and garages, older ones sliced and matched fruit and vegetables or created their own magnetic stories. I was lucky enough to get private readings of a number of these stories, and they were extremely well plotted."},
{"title": null, "date": "Friday, November 8, 2013", "text": "I've seen several blog posts from librarians who have offered life-size Candy Land programs for their preschoolers. As whimsical as these programs looked, I must admit I found the idea of transforming my library's multi-purpose meeting room entirely into Candy Land--then immediately tearing it down before the evening's homeowners association meeting--incredibly daunting. The idea of a life-size game really stuck with me, however, and I put it in my Google doc of back-burner ideas.The meeting room turned into aChutes & Ladders game boardI finally figured out a life-size game that made sense to an unprogramming-inclined librarian like me: Chutes and Ladders! The game is a classic for kids, it's pretty self explanatory, and it doesn't require its own world for real enjoyment. Earlier this week, I offered our Life-Size Chutes and Ladders program to school-age kids in my library. We had a dozen kids participate--a perfect number for a first go at a life-size game. Here's what we did.Room setup - With help from a page, I moved the tables to the back of our meeting room. With chairs along the walls for spectating caregivers, the bulk of the floorspace was wide open. I grabbed stacks of construction paper in red, yellow, green, and blue, as well as a roll of book tape, some yarn, and a roll of electrical tape. I used book tape on the back of construction paper to make the game board path. Chutes were made of yarn and connected two colored spaces on the board. Ladders were made out of electrical tape, and they also connected two colored spaces on the board. I set up the game board with 50 colored spaces, 4 chutes, and 4 ladders to start. (If you anticipate a bunch of kids or want shorter gameplay, decrease the number of spaces on the board.) I also set out a table with some of our books with kids' games.How to play - As kids came into the program, I had them make name signs for themselves. Each sign had a number, starting with 1, and I asked the kids to wear their signs around their necks with the assistance of yarn and a hole punch. The numbers were so I could make sure everyone took turns in order. On a child's turn, he or she would spin a game spinner borrowed from Twister; the Twister spinner has each of the four game colors on it, and it told the child what game space to move to. If he landed on red, he moved to the next red space. If she landed on green, she moved to the next green space. Once on their new spaces, the kids looked to see if they found themselves on a chute or a ladder. If they did, they moved accordingly. Finishing the game meant spinning a color no longer left in front of you.Keeping the game going - With a dozen kids all starting from the same space, the game was a big congested at first. After about three rounds of turns, though, the human game pieces were really starting to spread out. Everyone was a good sport about chutes (even the boy who repeatedly said, and I quote: \"This is the worst day ever!\"*), and ladders were very exciting. That said, it took about 30 minutes of gameplay before the first child finished the course. That child got to choose a book from a prize cart and then start back at the beginning. I also took this half-way point opportunity to do a few things: 1) tell the kids to stay on their squares, then give everyone a roll of Smarties for a Smarties break; 2) talk about how game designers test their games over and over again to make sure it's not too easy and not too hard; and 3) remove a chute and add a few ladders. We kept playing after the Smarties break, and as other children finished the course, I kept removing chutes and adding ladders. These modifications really excited the kids--where would there be a new ladder?!?--and also served to help move the game forward. By the time our hour for the program was up, every child had successfully finished the course and chosen a prize book to take home.How it went - The Life-Size Chutes and Ladders game went really well. Kids stayed engaged throughout the process, and they didn't grumble about waiting their turns or sliding down a chute. They were all really excited to be able to make it to the end of the course, which kept them all motivated and engaged. Caregivers were into the whole experience, too, because the game was very low-key. There was no single winner, and thus no competition to sour attitudes or fighting to get loud. One caregiver even pointed out how the whole game was a sort of exercise in patience and delayed gratification, all wrapped up in a gameplay bow. Children were genuinely excited to see what their spins would dictate, and they relished choosing their books at the end.Never underestimate the appeal of books as prizes.If you want to do this program... I highly recommend it! I would encourage you to think about a balance between number of participants and length of the program; this program worked well for us with around a dozen kids so everyone stayed engaged over the course of the hour. I'd also encourage you to be very flexible with the chutes and ladders you create--having a free hand with adding and removing them during the game can help move things along nicely. Lastly, never underestimate the power of books as prizes. Use those leftovers from the summer reading game, or galleys, or whatever you've got--going home with a book to keep is golden.*His mom told me he says that about at least three different things each day. When he finished Chutes & Ladders, he appropriately switched to saying it was the \"best day ever!\""},
{"title": null, "date": "Wednesday, November 6, 2013", "text": "Last week, Anna at Future Librarian Superhero shared her librarian creation story. She asked her readers to consider sharing their stories, too, and that's what I intend to do.I first wanted to be a librarian after seeing The Mummy. You know that nineties movie with Rachel Weisz as her career headed upwards, Brendan Fraser as his career headed the other way, and that mummy face made of sand? That movie. In case you don't remember the movie as well as you should, Rachel Weisz's character is a librarian. And she can keep her cool and use her brain in the most ridiculous mummy-has-arisen situations, even when her male counterparts just shoot things and/or die. She was the best. Obvious career path.That was middle school. In high school, I read a few articles* about librarianing. I learned about the Lipstick Librarian, whom I emailed to find out how I could become a librarian. I learned about Nancy Pearl and got her action figure. I bought a library community cookbook. I aided in the school library.In college, it took me a while to land on a major. Second-guessing my major made me second guess my longtime career choice, but I kept librarianing in mind. Two realizations during the summer before senior year showed me I was meant to go to library school: 1) I spent my summers as a camp counselor keeping a shelf of middle grade books for campers to read during rest hour; and 2) I made several trips to different libraries during my semester in Scotland despite having no scholastic inducement to do so. All signs pointed me back to libraries.In library school, I tried rare books (pretty interesting); I thought about digitization programs (not quite as interesting to me); but I LOVED doing children's services anything, whether it was in class or in my public library internship. It would appear that all has turned out for the best, as I still love doing anything children's services.And that's how I came to be a librarian.*Bitch magazine ran Abigail Leah Plumb's \"Smarty Girl: Three Librarians on Film\" in 2001; Bust ran Kat Long's \"Revenge of the Librarians\" in 2004."},
{"title": null, "date": "Monday, November 4, 2013", "text": "The number of outreach visits I'm making each season has skyrocketed, which means I'm really refining my bag of storytime tricks. Each month, I put together a new bag of stories, planned songs and rhymes, and maybe a puppet, but all that materials preparation doesn't completely do the trick--especially when a group gets the wiggles and sitting still is just not an option. What do I do when my story time crowds get the wiggles? These are some of the no-materials strategies I've been using in different levels of wiggle crisis:Low Wiggle Crisis:A brief song or rhyme interlude will suffice. My go-to is a wiggle-packed variation on the \"Finger Family\" rhyme.Wiggle Your Fingers!Wiggle your fingers up,Wiggle your fingers down.Wiggle your fingers all around.Wiggle them on your shoulders,Wiggle them on your head.Wiggle them on your knees,And tuck them into bed.I'll add extra variations to that rhyme, too, including having kids wiggle their fingers by different parts of their bodies. My recent favorite variation is to have kids wiggle fingers to one side, then wiggle them on the other, back and forth, so that we have an opportunity to talk about the hula. That odd change of topic at the end of the wiggle rhyme seems to get them back into listening mode.Another recent favorite for those low wiggle crises is the \"Fruit Salad\" song I learned at the first Guerrilla Storytime from Anna.Fruit Salad (tune=Frere Jacques)Watermelon, watermelonhold arms over head in an ovalPapaya, papayamove hands in two groundward bumpsBa-na-na-na-nana, ba-na-na-na-nanastart with hands over head and move downwardFruit salad! Fruit salad!make a bowl with handsWe usually do this song twice: once to learn it, then a second time to get silly with it.My last recent go-to favorite was taught to me during a Skype session with Cory of Storytime Underground:The Peanut SongA peanut sat on a railroad trackmimic holding a peanutAnd his heart was all a-fluttertap your heartAround the bend came Number 10move hand like train, then hold up ten fingersToot, toot!mimic pulling a train whistleSmash, smash!clap handsPeanut butter!raise hands in an \"oh, well\" gestureI should note that I learned these hand motions to go with the song when I did it with a particularly great preschool group--they taught me the motions that they do when they sing the song. (Their teacher also explains onomatopoeia when cowboy goes \"Eeeeek!\" in Let's Sing a Lullaby with the Brave Cowboy. Stellar!)Medium Wiggle Crisis:A sit-down wiggle song or rhyme just won't cut it, so we stand up for an action-packed song or two. I start with \"Form the Orange\" as demonstrated by the incredibly terrific Rick. I'll give you the words, but make sure you watch the video for all the motions.Form the OrangeForm the orange. Form, form the orange.Peel the orange. Peel, peel the orange.Squeeze the orange. Squeeze, squeeze the orange![I ask, \"What do you get when you squeeze an orange?\"]Form the potato. Form, form the potato.Peel the potato. Peel, peel the potato.Mash the potato. Mash, mash the potato![\"What do you get when you mash a potato?\"]Form the banana. Form, form the banana.Peel the banana. Peel, peel the banana.GO BANANAS! GO, GO BANANAS![after I explain what \"going bananas\" means, we do it again!]Another medium wiggle crisis option is the ever-popular \"We're Going to Kentucky,\" which many a librarian has recrafted to suit specific story time needs. I go for the original version I learned from Mel:We're Going to KentuckyWe're going to Kentucky, we're going to the fair,To see a señorita with flowers in her hair.march during this first coupletSo shake it, shake it, shake it, as fast as you can,Shake it like a milkshake, and do the best you can.wiggle/shake/twistShake it to the bottomtwist to the floorShake it to the toptwist back upTurn around, turn around, turn around...spinSTOP!freezeI particularly like Kendra's zoo version, which she uses in zoo-themed programs.High Wiggle Crisis:All hope is lost unless kids get to move their bodies and focus their attention on something they really enjoy. My strategy in these instances may seem counterintuitive, as we do not stand up to work out that energy. Instead, we tell stories with our hands.Little Bunny Foo Foo - I preface this story by telling the kids that they need to be able to do a few things to help. They need to make bunnies; hop those bunnies; make a scoop; bop their knees; shake a finger like someone did something naughty; and make magic fairy fingers. From there, we start singing the \"Little Bunny Foo Foo\" story, with high emphasis on what this crazy thing called a \"goon\" might be. Our goons end up with us making the silliest/scariest faces we can.Five Little Monkeys Sitting in a Tree - Marge shared this mind-bogglingly outstanding sign language version of the familiar rhyme at a Guerrilla Storytime. First she teaches the kids the signs for the important words: monkeys, swinging, tree, teasing, alligator, etc. Then she launches into the rhyme, saying and signing the words simultaneously. The repetition of the rhyme means that, by the time you're at three or two monkeys left, many of the kids have figured out at least a few of the signs. Then, as the grand finale, do the final \"One little monkey\" verse completely in sign. The tension builds and builds as the kids anticipate a big \"CLAP!\" as the last monkey gets snatched out of the tree. There is absolute silence in the room for that last verse, and everyone is fascinated.*Bonus for these stories: teachers and caregivers are familiar with them, even if they haven't shared them with their kids, and so they are interested to see how the librarian does them. When they participate because they're interested in a story, they aren't talking amongst themselves and distracting the kids, which can create wiggle crises in the first place.~~*~~What do you do when your story time crowd has the wiggles?"},
{"title": null, "date": "Friday, November 1, 2013", "text": "Today, November 1, marks the beginning of National Novel Writing Month, or NaNoWriMo. NaNoWriMo exists as a dedicated time to encourage aspiring writers to sit down and finally write that novel that's been percolating in their minds. NaNoWriMo takes place every November, and it presents the perfect opportunity for libraries to consider how they foster writing among their customers.At my library, we provide writing activities and spaces for the full age range of our customers.Children - We have offered a variety of writing activities for preschoolers and school-age kids in our children's spaces and children's programs. We've had a \"What We're Reading\" wall on which kids can write the names of the books they're currently enjoying. We also have magnetic doodle boards out for simple writing activities. In programs, preschoolers have gotten to create their own books while school-age kids have talked about and written poetry several times.Teens - At the request of several teens who started sharing their writing with one another while working the summer reading desk, our library now offers a monthly writing club. Each club opens with a brief writing exercise to get the juices flowing and serve as an ice breaker. From there, the hour-long club may include reading aloud from attendees' works, workshopping in small groups, and discussions about writing strategies and tips for working through writer's block. The teens have already formed a pretty tight-knit community of writers surrounding this club, which demonstrates this was a needed activity for the library to support.Adults (and teens) - On Thursday evenings throughout November, my branch has booked our meeting room for open NaNoWriMo time. We'll set out tables and bottles of water, and any folks interested in pounding out some writing can use the space and enjoy some writerly camaraderie. Staff will check in on the space periodically, but this is mostly a passive programming initiative. Sometimes the only thing holding potential writers back is lack of designated space to write.~~*~~How does your library foster writing among your customers?

{"title": null, "date": "Wednesday, October 30, 2013", "text": "My library has offered two stuffed animal sleepovers in the past, and they've both been hits. I think the premise works on multiple levels: it's undeniably cute; it responds to children's treatment of their stuffed animals as real; it raises intrigue about what happens in the library after hours; and it offers a slight variation on the usual story time format. All these interesting aspects combined create a fun and unique opportunity for early literacy programming.I've shared full details of the logistics of this program in my previous two posts--animals dropped off the night before, me running around the library to stage sleepover pics of the animals, pickup at story time the next morning--so head to those posts if you're looking for point by point explanation of how a stuffed animal sleepover works.Our pick-up story time went without a hitch, with the kids hugging their stuffed friends and listening like doting parents to what their friends did overnight. In our story time, we:Sang some songs - We started story time with my traditional opening song, \"Open, Shut Them.\" We also sang the \"ABC\" song because several children, when they dropped off their stuffed animals the night before, said that the \"ABC\" song was their animals' favorite. Adding little details like this--asking kids what their animals like, then doing those things--adds a whole other level of excitement and engagement in the event.Read some stories - I shared two stories with the kiddos that I had \"shared\" with their stuffed animals the night before. We shared Hugless Douglas and the Big Sleep by David Melling, as that story humorously deals with sleepovers. We also read Mo Willems's That Is Not a Good Idea!, which I said was the stuffed animals' favorite, and we talked about how what we thought was going to happen in the story isn't what really happened.Viewed the slideshow of sleepover pics - I used the Haiku Deck app to quickly put together a simple slideshow of the sleepover pics I'd taken on my iPad. Haiku Deck allows creators to share their presentations to the web, which made it very simple for me to email the attending caregivers so they could view the slideshow again at home.Created with Haiku Deck, the free presentation app for iPadBreakfast snack - I passed around glasses of apple juice and some mini donuts. It's a post-sleepover snack, after all.Craft time - I stapled together three-page books out of white computer paper and set out lots of stickers and crayons on each craft table. I invited the children to create books about their stuffed friends--about what they liked at the sleepover, about their favorite things to do together, etc. The creativity and thoughtful workmanship that went into these books was beautiful, as the children got very into creating accurate stories about their stuffed animals. At least half of the children wanted to read their stories to me before they left the library, and I was happy to hear them.~~*~~This go-round of the stuffed animal sleepover saw a 50-50 mix of return attendees and new faces. From my perspective, that's a good indicator of a program to keep in mind for continued occasional repetition."},

I've talked about this partnership in the past, and if you have the ability to create such a partnership with your local public safety folks, I highly recommend it. Kids especially enjoy getting to see inside an ambulance.If you don't have the ability to create this sort of partnership, however, that doesn't mean you can't tie some Halloween safety tips into an October program. Compliance and Safety shares some free tips for staying safe on Halloween addressing topics from costume safety, to food and candy safety, to other relevant details for families that may be planning to trick-or-treat. These are great tips to know from a reference perspective, and they can also make helpful asides in a Halloween program.I know that different libraries include (or don't) Halloween in different ways in their story time programs, from incorporating a single Halloween-themed story and craft into story time, all the way through having kids dress up and trick-or-treat through the library. Regardless of what your library does, consider making these Halloween safety tips available to the families you serve in some capacity. I've found that parents really appreciate the tips, and they also appreciate that the library cares about the safety of their children outside of library time. These small details really help us to build strong relationships with our service populations."},
{"title": null, "date": "Friday, October 25, 2013", "text": "One of the programs I inherited when I started my job here two years ago was the school-age Fall Festival. The program originated with my colleague Angie, who now puts her excellent talents to use with teen services, but it was such a hit we wouldn't have thought to drop it. What's great about programs like an annual Fall Festival is that, even though you offer them every year, you can switch up the activities you do in them. You end up with consistent attendance without driving yourself mad through repetition. Best of both worlds.This year, our Fall Festival consisted of four activities:Painting Pumpkins     I got a bunch of mini pumpkins from a local market and set them out on dessert-size plates to minimize paint spillage. I set out a few autumn-like colors of paint, too: green, yellow, black, and purple, as well as some glow-in-the-dark paint that was a hit. As children got to the program, I encouraged them to get down to painting their pumpkins however they wanted. Now, this is a Fall Festival--not a Halloween program--so I included pumpkins without a directive of jack-o-lanterns or anything else Halloween-related. I found that the kids painted their pumpkins with hugely diverse designs with this minimal instruction; whereas instructions for a jack-o-lantern would have enforced some creative limits, free painting was completely open.Draw and Tell \"The Night Walk\"     I told the story of \"The Night Walk\" from the script and drawing notes on the Notes from the Story Room blog. The story follows a pair of siblings, professing boredom, who accompany their father on a walk outside at night. In the dark, they encounter plenty of new noises--including the sound of the creature that results from this simple draw and tell tale.Pumpkin Mummy Relay Race     The kids split into two even groups and formed lines for our relay race. The race included two parts. First, each team member was to individually grab two small pumpkins, then speed walk around our course while holding them. When the first team member returned with the pumpkins, the next team member speed walked, and so on. Then, once all the walkers were finished, each team had two rolls of toilet paper and instructions to make two of their team members into mummies. The first team to successfully wrap two entire mummies would win, and incentive that inspired some interesting mummy-wrapping techniques. The excitement was pretty fierce for an activity that took a bit of time. You might say the kids got quite wrapped up in all that excitement. :)Candy Corn Bingo     Several years ago, my colleague Angie created a set of bingo cards filled with autumn imagery. We break out these cards for the Fall Festival and put out candy corn on the tables as card markers. I call the pieces until every child has won at least once--yesterday we had enough time for everyone to win twice. Each win nets two prizes: a piece of candy and a book. I buy a variety of candy from the dollar store to make our sweets options, and the books consist of ARCs and leftover summer reading prize books. I love seeing that, while kids will choose a piece of candy without giving it any thought, they choose their books carefully. There are always a few kids who ask incredulously if they can really keep the books \"for always\"; I'm happy to tell them yes.~~*~~There you have it: our high-energy, literacy-positive Fall Festival for school-age children.

{"title": null, "date": "Monday, October 21, 2013", "text": "One of the longest-running, most successful teen programs at my branch also happens to be an excellent example of teen-driven unprogramming: Anime Club.Once a month, teens interested in anime and/or manga--and there are a TON of them--converge on the library meeting room for two hours of socializing and communally enjoying their shared passion. Within that two-hour space, Anime Club hits all facets of unprogramming with teens:Ice Breaker -- Sometimes the program leader (typically my teen person, Angie) leads a game as an icebreaker, but sometimes the teens are already comfortably chatty and so the program opens with fevered discussion of recently-discovered anime series. On occasions when Anime Club includes cosplay, the ice breaker takes the form of a cosplay show and tell.Library Tie-in -- The library has lots of manga options in the young adult collections, and often the newest additions to the collection will be featured in Anime Club.Stations of Stuff -- The crux of Anime Club is viewing anime, be it in the form of full-length films, episodes from series (both from the library's collection and using free online samples deemed appropriate by a few key club members), and online clips. Often there are other activities, too, including anime coloring activities, making candy sushi, and using elements of the Anime Club Kit sponsored by our Friends of the Library group. This kit includes several manga puzzles from Tokyopop, manga playing cards and card games, and a guide for creating manga.Social Time -- As with many teen programs, there isn't designated, separate social time; instead, teens converse throughout the program.Food -- Anime Club at our branch necessitates two foods on a semi-regular basis: Poky and Ramen. See also: the candy sushi mentioned in Stations of Stuff.Anime Club takes place the same time every month, and this regular offering has allowed a core group of between 8-12 teens to attend pretty consistently. After district-wide teen events, like the lock-in, our numbers get a boost from teens who frequent other branches that don't have their own Anime Clubs.Anime Club has built a great camaraderie among the teen library users who might otherwise not find a niche outside of the manga section. Their enthusiasm for anime, and their suggestions for great films and series to consider for inclusion in the library's collection, really carries the endeavor and ensures that they feel a sense of ownership and belonging in the program. For relatively little staff and program cost, that's a lot of engagement by teens. That's the hallmark of a great unprogram."},

{"title": null, "date": "Wednesday, October 16, 2013", "text": "Maker spaces have been something of a libraryland topic du jour recently, and youth services most definitely has a role to play in the maker movement. Really, youth services is where it's at--where making has always taken place. Currently, there's the idea that maker spaces necessarily involve often-expensive equipment: 3D printers, woodworking tools, looms, soldering irons, computers with a gamut of fancy design software. These tools are great, no doubt about it, but they do not a maker space make. Think of all those crafts and open-ended building activities libraries have been hosting for children for decades. That's making right down to the core. We were making in the children's room long before maker spaces were cool.Libraries of every ilk can tap into their own maker potential by thinking about making's roots in youth services. High-tech is great, but it's not a maker space necessity, especially when it comes to making with kids. In my view, there are only a handful of true necessities. Making with kids means:1. Open-ended Activities -- While I agree that kids need to learn to follow directions and thus product-oriented activities have a benefit, I think open-ended activities are much more conducive to that making mindset. Open-ended making activities for kids can mean creating aliens--you decide what your alien looks like. It can mean choosing from a variety of techniques to create greeting cards for friends, children choosing the methods and materials they want to employ. Open-ended can mean we all have similar goals, but how we accomplish them is up to us. It can also mean a total free-for-all, open creative space in which the sky is the limit.2. Variety of Supplies -- Making is so much more interesting and creative when you have lots of tools and supplies to choose from. That fact works wonderfully with the realities of youth services, where we always have odds and ends left over from various crafts and activities. Making those aliens? Have a myriad of recyclables and leftovers to use as alien body elements. Offer different types of tape and glue so kids can choose what they think is appropriate for their individual creations. Don't assume everyone will want to use the same materials, and don't stifle by limiting supplies to just what you think you'd need to make the \"sample\" creation. Variety also allows makers to explore materials and techniques they've never experienced before, creating a truly valuable informal learning experience.3. Plenty of Time -- It takes time to create. In a library program space, kids need to get situated and get comfortable with the idea of their maker task; only then can they actually start to create something that is meaningful to them. And so time becomes a huge necessity: there needs to be plenty of time for kids to think, to explore and experiment with the materials at hand, to try out different techniques, to see what their neighbors are doing, and to change their minds. Short time limits and strict activity-to-activity schedules lead to unfinished products and creations kids don't care much about; time breeds challenge, creativity, and innovative thinking.4. Display Space -- Having a designated area in which to display children's maker space creations is wonderful. It advertises the types of maker activities other library customers could enjoy, and it allows the makers to feel pride in both their creations and the library. My library displays kids' LEGO Club creations every month on top of our reserves shelving, which is a high-traffic area. Display space can be at a premium in a library, though, so happily there are alternatives to physically displaying creations in the library. One option is to take pictures of the creations and print out a few for a library bulletin board. Another is to upload those photographs to the library's Facebook page or Flickr account. (Want lots of folks to visit your social media pages? Tell caregivers they can see their kids' creations on your pages, and *BOOM* hits galore.) You can even go all out and offer a gallery-style program in which all the various creations from library programs are on display in the program room.In my philosophy, if you have most or all of these components in any of your library activities, you're providing the kids you serve with a maker space. You don't have to call it a maker space. Chances are many of your customers don't even know what a maker space is, so the name isn't all that important. What is important is to offer youth the space, materials, and opportunity to engage their brains in hands-on creation. No curriculum, no specific desired final product. Just plain old making fun.~~*~~I've shared my maker philosophy in connection with my panel for The Digital Shift: Reinventing Libraries, titled \"The Community Joins In: Library Maker Spaces.\" I'd love for your to share your philosophies on maker spaces with youth in the comments, too."},

{"title": null, "date": "Monday, October 14, 2013", "text": "I took a detour from my usual Milk & Cookies Story Morning for this month. My planning process was starting to feel a bit too formulaic, which was harshing my story time juju. I decided to go ahead and put together a story time with a different set of goals for myself: use picture books of the \"new books\" shelf at my library and sneak in early literacy messages about all five practices. The challenge was invigorating for me, with fun interactive results for the kiddos.Opening Song: \"Open, Shut Them\"Story: Ghost in the House by Ammi-Joan Paquette, illustrated by Adam Record     This rhyming counting story is excellent for those looking to add a spooky story to story time without being explicitly Halloween. A ghost starts out in a house all alone, but he hears various eerie noises--a groan, a growl, and shriek--and one by one he's joined by other monster characters. Don't worry, though; the illustrations are cartoonish and not frightening. The kids had lots of fun mimicking the sounds of the monsters, especially the click-clack of a skeleton. This is a great story all on its own, but it would pair really well with Go Away, Big Green Monster to emphasize monsters are nothing to be afraid of.*Talking Tip: Imitating the creatures we see in books helps children become familiar with the range of sounds that occur in spoken and written language; their familiarity with all sorts of sounds will help them when it comes time to sound out words.Song: \"Monster Boogie\" by Laurie Berkner     We danced around like monsters to this fun, silly song from one of my favorite musicians for story time. RAWR!Song: \"Dancing Scarf Blues\" by Carole Peterson (with scarves)     I handed out scarves to all the kiddos in the room, then we shook those scarves with gusto as suggested by the song. What a great way to get the energy pumping!*Singing Tip: Singing repetitive songs with children is great because they reinforce new and important vocabulary. Our song included lots of words about directions: around, side, front, back, high, low. We learned all those words while having fun!Story: Tea Party Rules by Ame Dyckman, illustrated by K.G. Campbell     It's no secret that I loved Dyckman's Boy + Bot, and her newest story is another great look at an unlikely friendship. Cub, a young bear, stumbles upon a tea party table with lots of cookies, but the tea party hostess--a young girl--has several rules to which Cub must adhere before he can get to the cookies. The expressive pictures add to the humor of this story. I wrap up the story by asking the kids what they would like to play: tea party or bear.*Playing Tip: When children play, they get to experience the world and how it works in a safe space. Playing tea party or pretending to be a bear is really a learning exercise; they get to practice table manners, try out having claws, and use all sorts of words that go with special scenarios.Song: \"I'm a Little Teapot\"     After three tosses and a roll of the song cube, we were prompted to sing this classic song which paired perfectly with the preceding story. Serendipity!Song: \"Five Little Ducks\"     Another toss of the song cube led us to sing the fingerplay of \"Five Little Ducks.\" We worked on getting our fingers to show the appropriate number of ducks, and we had plenty of fun quacking loudly as the mamma duck.Story: I Spy on the Farm by Edward Gibbs     This companion to I Spy With My Little Eye contains a great variety of farm animals to spy and guess. Kids are prompted to guess the spied animal by its color and the sound it makes, just like in the companion book, with one great addition: the text says the letter the animal begins with. When sharing this story, I like to say (for a duckling, as an example): \"This animal starts with 'D.' Can you use your finger to draw a 'D'? The 'D' makes a 'duh' sound.\" I love the added element of drawing letters.*Writing Tip: Writing together doesn't have to mean using pencil and paper. Your child can draw in the air, in bubbles in the bathtub, or in a pan of uncooked rice--these are all great ways to get familiar with creating and recognizing letters.Song: \"We're Going to Kentucky\"     What can I say? I just love this song, and so do the kids, and thus I will happily repeat it a second month in a row.*Reading Tip: Don't forget that there are lots of books on display next to me that you can check out and read at home! Reading together with your child is a great way to have fun together, and it also promotes a love of words and reading in your child. If you show that you enjoy reading together, your child will love it, too!Milk and Cookies Time!     Honey Teddy Grahams and 2% milk. Mmm.Free Play Time     I set up four free play stations on the play side of our meeting room: vehicles and garages; play food; puzzles and writing; and science, with magnets, scale, and creature building. One mom in attendance told the whole group that our local fire house was having an event that same day: all the fire trucks would be out of the station and kids could tour them and find out more about being firefighters. That tip meant most of the families didn't stay to play for much longer than 20 minutes--they all wanted to head over to the first station. We had a great time while the kiddos were in the room, however, and I engaged in quite a few conversations with the children about what they were doing. I got plenty of insight into how a child works through a puzzle. Fascinating!"},

{"title": null, "date": "Wednesday, October 9, 2013", "text": "In addition to co-hosting Guerrilla Storytime and presenting a breakout session on Digital Story Times, I got to attend many a quality, thought-provoking session at the 2013 Missouri Library Association Conference. I left with oodles of ideas, some with potential for immediate implementation, and others for future initiatives. Here are my favorites:For Immediate Implementation:Get/Make a sensory blanket for babies. This simple and brilliant idea was shared, as a brief part of a larger idea, by Stephanie Smallwood of Springfield-Greene County Library District during her session on taking early literacy to outreach. Sensory blankets are soft quilt-like blankets, with patches and sections of fabrics with different textures and sensory features sewn into the main blanket fabric. Think a touch-and-feel board book in quilt form, ready to be taken anywhere, laid on the floor, and machine-washed when needed. Genius.Create a designated science area for children, and operate it thoughtfully. I'm taking Stephanie Smallwood's broad preschool STEM idea and applying in more broadly and with more specifics. In my carved-out science space in the branch, I'll keep the science items/theme consistent for an entire month. Use rocks as an example: rocks will by at the science station all month long. For the first two weeks of the month, the station will be about engaging with rocks: lots of varieties so kids can explore what they look like and how they feel, and also including books on the topic to help kids (and caregivers) answer questions they may have. During the second two weeks of the month, the rocks will stay the same but additional elements will be added for experimenting with rocks: a scale to weigh, magnifying glasses to look closer, a tub of water to test buoyancy, for example. Over the course of a month, when a child may visit the library two or more times, he or she gets to first engage with the STEM concept and then experiment with it, allowing for deeper concept learning. There's no reason this strategy would apply only to preschoolers--I can think of many a school-age child who would be fascinated by said science station.Use the Recaptains (recaptains.blogspot.com) for help catching patrons (or myself) up on series backstory before reading a new release. Enough said.Keywords for database instruction with school partners are \"easy\" and \"visual.\" Teachers are super busy with nary a spare moment in their schedules; if we want to entice them with databases and all they can do, we need to emphasize that we can provide tools to make aspects of their jobs easier. For students, be they elementary, middle, or high schoolers, visuals are important. Share the databases with visual interfaces and they'll be much more open to learning how to use them.For Storing In the Library Brain Until a Later Date:Partner with lots of community organizations to support early literacy initiatives, even those organizations that may seem less obvious. Stephanie Smallwood talked about some of her library's community partners, ranging from the traditional (WIC) to the less common but really smart (The Doula Foundation). There are many, many community organizations with potential to impact families in a positive way; the library should work with them.Provide early literacy training for the staffs at partner organizations. The library has the potential to interact with families who utilize these organizations only while a library staff member is present and conducting outreach. Organization staff, on the other hand, have much larger windows of opportunity for interacting with these families--basically, anytime they visit. By providing early literacy training to the staff at partner organizations, not only do these staff get a greater understanding of why the library is involved, but they also develop their own skills and knowledge to share early literacy messages and resources with families during the course of their regular interactions.~*~Have you been to a conference lately?

I think it's particularly important to share details about my own STEAM programs and services, both here on this blog and elsewhere in libraryland; sometimes a bit of info, a testimonial, or a ready-to-go program plan is all that stands in the way of another library trying STEAM, and thus reaching a new, possibly-untapped audience of young library users.

All this week, readers will have the opportunity to hop across a number of outstanding youth services and children's literature blogs to find out more about this new early literacy book award as well as some great go-to books that reinforce early literacy practices. It all starts now!What are the Bell Awards, you ask? The Bell Awards are a new annual endeavor designed to recognize picture books that strongly support young children’s early literacy development. Books recognized by the Bell Award will somehow thematically feature the five early literacy practices: reading, writing, singing, talking, and playing. These recognized books will represent excellent choices for parents and caregivers to share with their pre-readers; the titles will model positive co-reading habits and support them as they engage their children in activities that build reading readiness. While the Bell Award was created and will be administered by Colorado Libraries for Early Literacy (CLEL), note that this is not a state-specific award. The Bell Award can have an impact on libraries and classrooms across the country, helping to identify the best books for early literacy practices in a publishing year. It is hoped that children’s librarians and other professionals will discuss the titles nominated for awards in any of the five practices--after all, it's this type of discussion that fosters sharing and learning about early literacy best practices. I know I'm always up for seeing what my colleagues are using in their own early literacy efforts.As the first stop on the Bell Awards Blog Tour, I am tasked with sharing with you some of my favorite books for young children that strongly illustrate the early literacy practice of writing. Since I'm a frequent storytime practitioner--sometimes with as many as 10 story times a week--my list of \"Write\" books is heavily biased in favor of readaloud titles that work for groups as well as one-on-one reading. Without further ado:Books that Model the Early Literacy Practice \"Write\"Andrew Drew and Drew by Barney Saltzberg     What can you create with a pencil and a blank page? As Andrew demonstrates throughout the story, which centers around his wonderfully imaginative drawings, the sky's the limit when it comes to creating things on paper. This book does a great, subtle job of illustrating that marks on a page have meaning, and that the person who makes the mark can decide that meaning.Chalk by Bill Thomson     This beautiful wordless picture book works best one-on-one or with small groups; I like to ask lots of questions about what's going on in each picture. The basic premise is that children draw pictures with chalk, and those pictures come to life. What an imaginative way to show that what we put on a page represents real things in the world.Giggle, Giggle, Quack by Doreen Cronin, illustrated by Betsy Lewin     Farmer Brown has gone on vacation and left his brother in charge of the farm. His brother is supposed to followed the written instructions left for him, but unfortunately the mischievous Duck has found a pencil and is writing odd instructions of his own. The animals get all sorts of special treatment--pizzas, movie nights--because of the words in Duck's notes. When I share this story with a group, I use my finger to point to the words I'm reading in Duck's notes to emphasize that the words I'm saying are on the page. At the end of the story, I always ask how Duck was able to get the farmer's brother to do all these silly things: because he wrote them down.There's An Alligator Under My Bed by Mercer Mayer     This book may not be the most obvious one to model the practice of writing, but I like to use it in two ways: the minimal text per page makes it simple to point out that the words on the page are the ones I'm saying; and the story is funnier when you read the notes the boy leaves for his father on the last page. I always talk about these notes at the end of the reading, and I ask what the kiddos would write on a note to their parents if there were an alligator in the garage.Z is for Moose by Kelly Bingham, illustrated by Paul O. Zelinsky     This cheeky book is great with preschoolers and early elementary children who know or are learning the alphabet. Moose is meant to be part of a production that features all letters of the alphabet, but he has no patience and starts to mess things up. Not only does this book promote letter knowledge--integral for learning to write letters and words--but Moose's funny signs and other written markings throughout the book are great examples of writing to communicate something.~~*~~Those are my picks of some of my favorite books for the pre-reader crowd that model writing. Do you have favorites? If you've got favorites that have been published in 2013, you should absolutely nominate them for the Bell Awards!

{"title": null, "date": "Friday, September 27, 2013", "text": "While I've not read a ton of steampunk, my few recent forays into the subgenre have been marked with great stories and page-turning premises. In short, I've found steampunk delightfully imaginative, and I couldn't see why school-age kids wouldn't have a similar reaction. Thus my school-age steampunk program was born.In this 45 minute unprogram, we talked books, played a game, and got crafty. Here's what it looked like:All Aboard the Airship!The first element I include in any of my unprograms is something that ties to the library--in this case, book talks. After discussing what \"steampunk\" means and where it got its name, I shared a few of my favorite steampunk books with the assembled kiddos in the form of book talks. I consider Matthew J. Kirby's The Clockwork Three, The Expeditioners and the Treasure of Drowned Man's Canyon by S. S. Taylor, and Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events to be great examples of steampunk for the middle grade reader. I had copies of these books, both print and audiobook when available, for kids to check out if their interest was piqued. (Quite a few copies did make their way out of the library post-program).After our book talks, I got the energy level pumping by introducing a game I called \"Airball.\" One might liken the game to ping-pong with balloons. I made paddles by fixing jumbo craft sticks to paper plates, and we swatted at balloons in an effort to keep them off the floor. Things got really interesting when, with 7 balloons in play, we formed a wide circle and planted our feet on the ground. All of the kids had fun trying to keep the balloons aloft swinging their paddles only in the radius of their arms' reach.In talking about steampunk books, we discussed how many of these titles take place in interesting or fictional places, and thus they include detailed maps. Thus we got down to the business of making our own maps, marking spots for treasure or warning about villains and giving places ominous-sounding names. Quite a bit of creativity was on display in the creation of these steampunk maps, although the younger children didn't have as much interest in adding details to theirs.Our final activity was to make those titular airships. Using paper plates, a straw, a single-egg portion of an egg container, yarn, and duct tape, we built and decorated our airships. To make them fly across our room, we threaded them onto some string using the straws we had taped to their tops. Pretty soon we had a colorful airship parade making its way across our programming room.We finished our activities a few minutes past the 45-minute stated program length, but as everyone was enjoying themselves, no one seemed to mind. In fact, a few of the kiddos, after perusing the steampunk books on display, stayed in the room playing Airball a little longer. A successful program, by one definition, is one where the activities facilitate sustained engagement.~~*~~Have you offered genre- or subgenre-focused programs for the school-age kids who use your library? What works for you?"},

Are you looking for research to justify purchasing a programming tablet for your library? Tablets are a story time tool just like a puppet or a ukulele; they allow library staff to develop children’s early literacy skills while engaging them and their caregivers in new ways. This session will explore the benefits of adding tablet technology to programs for preschool children. Participants will see demonstrations of ways to add digital elements to the story time programs they already offer, including creating and using digital felt stories, sharing books and apps with interactive elements, supplementing themed programs with non-fiction resources, and making songs and rhymes more accessible to audiences. The session will also highlight some of the exciting new programs libraries can offer when tablets are added to the story time toolbox.Speaker: Amy Koester, Children’s Librarian, St. Charles City–County Library DistrictSponsored By: YSCIIf you'll be at MLA, I hope you'll say hello!"},

{"title": null, "date": "Friday, September 20, 2013", "text": "The weather is finally starting to cool off here in Missouri--we're slowly inching closer to my personal ideal temperature range, 45-65. The break from the heat means many families are opting to spend weekend mornings out of doors, and who can blame them? Great weather is a true pleasure. Happily, I saw many families veteran and new at this month's Milk & Cookies Story Morning. Here's what we enjoyed before families headed out into the sunshine:Opening Song: \"Open, Shut Them\"Story: Ribbit! by Rodrigo Folgueira     I love sharing this newer story for a number of reasons. It allows me to engage the kiddos in making animal noises that relate to the page, and it also boasts a simple story about how, sometimes, we all just want to make a friend. When I share this story, the children and I make ever-more-dramatic \"ribbit!\" noises until the climax of the tale, at which point we have a new sound to make.Song: \"Do the Bird\" by The Kerplunks     This song gets everyone up and moving making silly motions like a variety of birds. How many different types of birds do 3- to 6-year-olds know? Judging by their enthusiasm for this song, they know plenty and are happy to imitate them.Song: \"I Know a Chicken\" by Laurie Berkner, with egg shakers     I've mentioned before that this is a favorite go-to shaker song for me. When we're in the bird song mood, how can I not include it?Finger Play with an App: \"Five Little Pirates\" using Felt Board from Software Smoothie     I love the Felt Board app, and I'm just getting the hang of really using it in appropriate story time settings. With its variety of felt shape options--people, scenery, animals, costumes, common objects found in rhymes and fairy tales--I've felt inspired to make digital felt board versions of some of the felt rhymes and stories that would be too cumbersome for my limited artistic abilities (and patience). When I make a series of felt boards that I intend to share in a particular order, I take screen captures of the boards I want to use and then add the images into a Keynote slideshow presentation. Easy peasy, all images are in the correct order and ready to share.     For \"Five Little Pirates,\" I create six different pirates on a pirate ship background--all of the pirates looked a bit different and wore different things, allowing me the option of talking to the kids about what they could see. They easily spotted the captain: the one with the sword and big pirate's hat. I added a slide into the beginning of my felt board slideshow to display the words for our rhyme, inviting caregivers to look at the words and join us in the telling:Five Little PiratesFive little pirates went sailing one day,Over the seas and far away.The captain cried, \"Yo, ho, ho, ho!\"And four little pirates sailed back home...Song: \"Grey Squirrel\"     With a toss of our song cube, the kiddos and I sang \"grey squirrel.\" Many a caregiver thought it was utterly adorable and took photos of their little ones shaking their bushy tails.Song: \"Head, Shoulders, Knees, and Toes\"     I've found that kids really like the whole idea of the song cube, so I've started doing two tosses (and two songs) in a row. Our second song was the perennial favorite \"Head, Shoulders, Knees, and Toes,\" and as soon as they knew the song we would sing, the kiddos launched right into it.Story: Little Red Riding Hood by Bernette Ford     As part of my ongoing goal to share folk and fairy tales with the little ones, I pulled this newly-released version of Little Red Riding Hood to share at our story morning. The clean illustrations are great for crowds of varying sizes, and the pacing of this classic story never fails to enthrall. Each time I share such a \"common\" story, I find that it seems more and more children haven't heard the tale before--and those who have are happy to see another telling.Song: \"We're Going to Kentucky\"     What's not to love about a song that lets us work on our marching, our shaking/shimmying, and our turning around/twirling? Always a hit.Milk and Cookies Time!     I had two teen volunteers in the room for this particular story morning, which meant I had help in passing out the milk and cookies to the kiddos. While the volunteers poured the milk, I went around with alphabet-shaped cookies--perfect for reinforcing letter knowledge.Free Play Time     The biggest hit at play time on this particular day was definitely the play food station I set up. I put out play dishes, play sandwich fixings, and play pizzas, and boy oh boy did the kiddos get down to business making meals for everyone in the room. Vocabulary was absolutely soaring--I heard talk about foods, about drinks, about how to make foods, about kitchens, about family members and what they like to eat. The only time the chatter stopped was when we had to pretend eat our meals and sip our drinks. These play food items are temporarily at my branch while I process our district's early literacy play kits after their first year of branch-to-branch travel, but I will certainly be looking to have some play food items at my branch permanently."},
{"title": null, "date": "Wednesday, September 18, 2013", "text": "I drove over to the newly-renovated Central branch of the St. Louis Public Library last night for a middle grade author event. Three authors were assembled: Catherine Jinks, Catherine Gilbert Murdock, and Jasper Fforde, all of whom are masters of, among other things, world-building. As I listened to the authors talk about their processes, their inspirations, how their characters and places come to life, I kept making lots of connections. One of the benefits of reading in volume, it would seem, is that books become linked and interconnected across genres and publishing date--lots of great titles to pair with others to make the readers in your life happy.My favorite sound bite from the evening came from Jasper Fforde. In response to an audience question which I cannot quite remember with accuracy, Fforde began talking about how once a book is shared, even with a single person, it is no longer just the author's creation. As more and more people read the book, it becomes the book of all those readers. Which means, posited Fforde, that if a reader really, really loves a book, the author shouldn't get all the credit for making it a great book; the reader should get ample credit, too.With all of the talk of the excellent world-building among the novels of these three authors, it would be easy to attribute all genius to the writer. But not so--the writer creates, but the reader envisions. The writer draws the map, and the reader resides within the story. It is that partnership, that working together, that makes for a truly great book that resonates.What does that mean for librarians like me? It means I should give readers credit for the joy they find in the books they love. Readers are active participants in the world of the book, and it is their participation that makes the story so rich for them. I should give readers credit for the interactions they have with any and all books, whether they are books I would love as deeply or not. Giving readers credit means asking young readers not just what they liked and didn't like about a book, but also asking what it was like for them to be within the story. Asking this sort of question can help me to provide better readers' advisory to young readers as well; when I understand how a reader can engage with a story, I can start to make deeper connections to the sorts of books they may like beyond simple genre and standard appeal factors.Think this concept of giving the reader credit for the experience of being in the book is utter nonsense? Try this thought experiment: call to mind your favorite book, and actively try to remember what the experience of reading that book is like; the interacting with the characters, the watching as the story unfolds, the very real, very visible settings. The author did some of that, but you make it real for yourself. Those are the books you fall in love with, the real ones. Give yourself some credit."},

I create my program content around the ready-to-use Powerpoint-based presentations that come with the ECRR2 kit, which I modify to include my library's branding and my own talking points and activities. This autumn finds me focusing on the \"Fun with Letters\" presentation, complete with a variety of activities to pair with each of the five practices. Here's what we're doing this September:Fun with Letters: Activities to Pair with the ECRR Parent/Child WorkshopTalkWe work together to say the letters in every child's name; children write their names on a small paper plate (tactilely more interesting to them than nametags, I've found), so all the adults in the room have a cheat for name spellings.We play an \"I Spy\" game using our alphabet rug in the program room; I name an object featured on the rug, and the kids search for it and identify the letter it starts with, also shown on the rug.ReadZ is for Moose by Kelly Bingham is for slightly older, more engaged audiences, and we talk about the letters and objects we see on each page.With younger children, I usually do a picture walk through G is for Goat by Patricia Polacco,  demonstrating that you don't have to read a story fully for it to have a positive literacy impact.PlayI set out alphabet-reinforcing toys at the beginning of the program while families trickle in: alphabet machines, doodle boards, and an I Spy bottle.We play with pipe cleaners to make the letters in our names. Lots of exercising those fine motor skills!SingWe sing the letters of the alphabet to the tune of \"Mary Had a Little Lamb,\" a trick of Saroj Ghoting's to help children hear the differentiation between all 26 letters--no more amorphous \"ellemmennohpi.\"We make an ABC parade; using the alphabet rug as our guide, we parade along the letters of the alphabet, naming them as we go.We sing \"Willowby Wallowby Woo\" with the silly assistance of a Horton the elephant stuffed animal.WriteWe practice making letters using shaving cream as our medium. I fill sandwich-size zipper-lock baggies with a bit of shaving cream, then seal the tops with duct tape. Ta-da! Trace and erase!With butcher paper covering our program room tables, kids get to use crayons to draw all over the tables. Older children work on their letters while others create a comfort with writing.~~*~~These activities keep kids pretty well engaged and excited while their caregivers get a bunch of accessible early literacy tips they can take home, and we all get to have some fun with letters!Have you offered a variation on the \"Fun with Letters\" ECRR2 workshop?

On busy or tough or downright frustrating days, I know that I'll find motivation and new energy as soon as I see what my peers are up to. Twitter, blogs, conferences, webinars--it all helps me recharge my library battery. And it's because you speak up.I see so many youth librarians who are incredibly passionate about what they do, and because of that passion, they speak up. They speak up for the underserved children in their communities. They speak up to share ideas for new programs and services. They speak up when they think a training--in programming, in readers' advisory, in early literacy--will help staff and the library, and they speak up when asked to make that training happen. Passionate youth librarians speak up because they know that what we do is important.So, today, I just want to remind you--yes, YOU!--to speak up. Do you have an idea for a new program that fills a gap in what you currently offer? Speak up! Do you see an area of your service population that isn't being reached by library marketing? Speak up! Do you see other libraries offering a service that you think your customers would love? Speak up!Bring your concerns and your ideas to the table; speak up and provide an impetus to keep libraries fresh, engaging, and relevant. Speaking up isn't obstructionist, it's productive; it gets conversations started in the library world. It demonstrates that you care enough about your organization and the work you do to always want to do your best.When you speak up, it's inspiring.

{"title": null, "date": "Monday, September 9, 2013", "text": "Every once in a while, I share a day in my library life here on the blog. I love getting to read what other librarians' days are like, with full recognition that no two days are ever the same in this profession. Case in point: my Thursday of last week.8:50 a.m. - Arrive at the municipal building one town over in advance of a training. Chat with colleagues from other library branches before the training begins.9:00 a.m. - Performance Evaluations training. Several staff members from several of our library branches, as well as from other county and city departments, participated in this three-hour training that included strategies and advice for conducting effective, legal performance evaluations. I think trainings like this are particularly helpful, especially when working in a collaborative workplace where many employees consider themselves friends with supervisors. It's always good to get some reminders on keeping performance evaluations objective and productive.12:00 p.m. - Brief meeting with my branch manager and circulation supervisor.1:00 p.m. - Early Literacy Task Force meeting over lunch. This Task Force consists of three children's librarians, each of us from different branches. We meet regularly to coordinate early literacy initiatives for the entire library district, including trainings. Our agenda for the meeting included planning a winter training on childhood brain development; making plans for proceeding with year 2 of our Early Literacy Play Kits; ideas for library-branded ECRR2 signage; and discussion about hosting an all-county playdate next summer. We also brought the newly-hired Extension Services Specialist for the district up to speed on what we do.2:30 p.m. - Head over to the library branch that will host an author event I've coordinated.3:00 p.m. - Since I have time before needing to get up to the room for the author event, I head to the children's services office to check my e-mail and messages. Since this isn't my branch or normal workspace, I do my work on my iPad. I also chat with a colleague about goings-on at this library in both the children's and teen programming arenas.4:00 p.m. - I head upstairs to the large event space and start to get odds and ends prepared for the evening's author visit with Peter Brown. I spend some time verifying his bio and awards, then I write the introduction I'll give to start the event.5:40 p.m. - Folks start to arrive for the author event, and I help direct them toward the table to purchase books. I also talk with folks about other upcoming author events.6:00 p.m. - It's go time for Peter Brown's author event! Peter Brown is one of my favorite children's author/illustrators to work with. His presentation is always engaging for audiences of any age, he happily talks with kids while signing books, and he's overall pretty low-key about visiting libraries. His presentation, which tied into his just-released picture book, Mr. Tiger Goes Wild, got lots of laughs and questions from the audience of 113 people.6:45 p.m. - It's my job to keep the signing line moving, having books open to title pages and post-its for personalization in clear view when I slide them to Peter. I also pass out some cool Mr. Tiger tattoos that Peter brought with him. (Also, if you are wondering, Why the hat? It's become something of a tradition for me to wear something relating to one of Peter's characters when he visits. That hat is a bit proper, a bit wild.)7:30 p.m. - The final book signed, it's time for Peter Brown to head to the airport so he can be in his next city for his next event the next day. It's hugs and handshakes all around, and then a few library staffers and I stay to finish cleaning up the event space.7:40 p.m. - I head home after a long day full of a variety of fun, productive, and insightful activities. Note that I didn't even step foot in my own branch library for the entire day. Rest assured, my desk reflected my absence the next day, with plenty of piles to indicate I'd been missed."},
{"title": null, "date": "Friday, September 6, 2013", "text": "My preschool story times don't usually have a craft component anymore. That has more to do with the types of preschool programs I do: outreach, where it's a large group story time with no space or time for craft; preschool science, where we do hands-on experiments and activities after sharing a story; and Milk & Cookies Story Morning, where our post-story time activity is free play time. Basically, the only opportunities I have to offer a craft in a preschool story time program are when I'm offering a special one-off program or filling in for a colleague on vacation.And in those instances, I am all about the process art for preschoolers.A simple breakdown of \"process art\": an open-ended art activity that focuses primarily on having the children involved in the process of creation. Process art is an alternative to \"product art,\" wherein the focus is on each child creating the same basic craft modeled after a sample. As the names suggest, one is about the creative process, and one is about the final product.I love process art for preschoolers for a number of reasons. First, studies and experts have proclaimed that process art is the most developmentally appropriate art activity for preschool-age children. These young children are building their background knowledge of everything they encounter, even craft supplies. Through process art, children get to really explore what paint is, what it does, how it feels, how it works, and what they can do with it. They can experiment with how colors interact, what happens when crayon and paint mix on the page, how to place paint where they want it on the page. Process art allows preschoolers to gain hands-on knowledge of how art works.Process art also more deeply involves preschoolers in the creative process, giving them more pride in what they create. Basically, preschoolers don't care if the butterflies they make looks like the librarian's butterflies. They are more involved in creation if they get to decide where to place the spots or stripes, what colors to make the wings. Allowing children to create according to their own visions provides ample opportunities for discussion--why did you use those colors?--and the very personal finished product means something to the child. He or she made it in its entirety, which is a definite matter of pride. That's opposed to product art activities in which preschoolers often need adult assistance to make the cut-and-paste replicas of a sample craft. Making a copy just isn't as engaging. Process art is much more personal.I will quickly note here that, sometimes, caregivers do care what their children's artwork looks like, and they prefer a picture that is obviously a ladybug to hang on the fridge than a red blob. These caregivers prefer product art for the wrong reasons: aesthetics over engagement. I've found that a few simple statements shared during craft time help caregivers see the whys of process art, and it makes them appreciate their children's creations much more. We share early literacy information for caregivers' benefits, and sharing similar information on art activities isn't that different.Process art is also great from a story time provider's standpoint. Process art means less pre-program preparation, as activities don't require precise, pre-cut supplies and other specific items. Process art means setting out a variety of supplies and sharing loose parameters for free creation. One recent example from a program I led involved painting ice cream cones. With white paper, brown paper for cones, glue sticks, and paint on the table, each child could paste a cone to the paper and then paint an ice cream cone that suited their imaginations. They all looked very different, and each child had wonderful things to say about what flavors they had painted on their cones. The parameters were basic--create an ice cream cone--but the rest of the craft was open-ended, allowing children to engage in creating an ice cream cone that they saw in their heads.While my library still offers product art activities for preschoolers every once in a while, for the most part my colleagues have transitioned to using process art in their programs. The creations have been diverse, although I think the hit so far has been painting with mud for a springtime story time; what's more engaging for a child, to paint a picture of mud or a picture with mud? Ask yourself that type of question for your crafts, and you'll come up with process art most of the time."},
{"title": null, "date": "Monday, September 2, 2013", "text": "First off, let me say: I think we, youth services librarianship, do early literacy pretty darn well. Sure, we have room for improvement, could use more trainings and refreshers, would benefit from professional development and conference sessions on early literacy programming. But, for the most part, we do a pretty good job of understanding and meeting the need for early literacy programming.That said, I think our (necessary) focus on early literacy programming has caused us to (unnecessarily) leave school-age programming by the wayside.It is part of my personal philosophy of public library service that public libraries should offer diverse programming options to school-age children. In many libraries, these children age out of preschool early literacy programming and don't have much to look forward to at the library until they're old enough to enjoy the teen programs that libraries have been building over the past decade. Occasionally there's a craft, and maybe there's a LEGO Club--both great programs for sure. But that's not enough.School-age children are at this wonderful age in which they are really starting to become their own people. They spend significant portions of their days away from Mom and Dad, be it at school and/or activities, and this time away helps them to see and experience things from their own personal perspectives. School-age children are starting to develop their own personal interests, and public libraries should help them develop these new interests. We should offer them programs in which they get a taste of science, of history, of fantasy, of mythology. We should offer them activities in a program setting to really explore topics and ideas they may not have really interacted with before, like building and mummification and zeppelins and every interesting thing about the world. We should offer school-age children programs in which kids can discover, learn about, and celebrate their interests with their peers.I very strongly believe school-age programming is something that every public library with programming services should provide. To that end, I have a few things to say to the key players in making school-age programming happen.Librarians and other library staff who plan and lead programs: Make school-age programming a professional goal. Think about the level of programming you currently provide to preschoolers and/or teens and then try to help school-age programming catch up in terms of number of options. Offer a combination of recurring programs (Kids Advisory Board, book discussion club, LEGO Club) and stand-alone programs at times that work for your community. Make sure to include literary elements or other ties to your library collections in your programs; after all, programming is about building a love and use of the library. And when it comes to planning programs, please don't feel like you have to go it alone. Use the myriad of terrific resources that exist, from blogs, conference content, and Pinterest boards that share great school-age programming ideas. Better yet, use your personal learning network. Ask your peers what's worked for them, and then think about modifying it to fit your library's needs. There are so many amazing programs out there (here's a post that shares just the tip of the iceberg of my go-to sources of inspiration) that you need never start totally from scratch unless you want to.Library managers and administrators: Make school-age programming an institutional priority. There's no good reason for the continuum of library services to drop to minimum levels when we talk about grade schoolers. In fact, it's good business sense to offer free, fun activities for children this age--practically every other activity these kids might participate in costs money, from scouting to sports to arts lessons and classes. Having free alternatives readily available at the library not only levels the playing field in terms of who can participate, but it also sends a very important signal to caregivers that the library is here for them and their families' educational and leisure needs. There are few ways to so quickly become a vital institution in the eyes of parents.Folks with influence in library staffing and hiring: Where are the school-age specialist positions? I love how more and more libraries are crafting specific early literacy specialist positions; what a great resource to have on staff, someone who can do all the things a youth librarian does and additionally offer early literacy-specific program planning and training. Pat yourselves on the back if you've hired one. But the school-age service area requires just as much focus. Imagine your library with a school-age specialist: that's a librarian who can create diverse programming options for use in multiple settings; who can serve as point person on educational initiatives that impact the library, such as Common Core; who can develop frameworks for services that help children achieve their developmental assets; and who can train colleagues to more effectively reach their school-age customers and their families through programs and services. That's a librarian with the capacity to add significant value across the whole institution, and yet not many libraries have thought of hiring one.It all comes to this: all school-age children with access to a library should have the opportunity to enjoy regular, age-appropriate programming that interests them. Access is an entirely different issue in and of itself, but when the library is there, it should offer activities for school-age kids that kids want to attend. We need to better serve these young customers. We need to talk about school-age programming."},
{"title": null, "date": "Friday, August 30, 2013", "text": "Starting a few years back, when the teen services department was just getting up and running in my library district, my branch's teen person decided to offer an Iron Chef-themed program for teens. Since then, Iron Chef and other food competition-style programs have been surefire hits when part of our teen programming schedule. This summer, I helped my branch's main teen staffer put on just such a program: Cupcake Wars. Here's what we did:The Preparations: My colleague and I prepared the program room for the competition by setting out all our tables, covering them with tablecloths, and setting out individual work stations complete with paper plates, plastic utensils, and rubber gloves (a necessity for a program in which customers are handling food). We also set out a pretty impressive table of supplies; in addition to the cupcakes, there were a variety of icings, candies, fruits, and odd items (Chex mix, bacon bits) available for the competing chefs to use in their creations. Preparations also included pre-ordering un-iced cupcakes from our local grocery store and picking them up before the program.The Challenge: Once teens had arrived for the program and made their way to the work stations, we shared the rules of the event. Each teen would be working individually (sometimes teens work in pairs or teams, but we had enough supplies for a solo competition this time around). The challenge was to choose a book--any book--and create a cupcake creation somehow inspired by or related to that book. Each teen had three cupcakes with which to work, and each teen could use only four additional types of food items from the supplies table. Final creations would be judged by peers on appearance and fidelity to book inspiration, and a panel of official judges (staff and a designated teen participant) would also judge based on appearance and taste.The Competition: Once rules were explained and questions answered, teens went to the supplies table a few at a time to gather their ingredients. To avoid total supply-grabbing chaos, we had teens head to the supplies based on birth month. Once supplies were in hand, teens had a total of about 30 minutes to work their cupcake magic. They could return to the supplies table for additional quantities of any of the original four supplies they had chosen.The Twist: What's a cooking competition without a twist? With five minutes of work time left, we announced that each chef could add a fifth food element to their creations. Cue the run on the supplies table. (My favorite was the boy who chose Chex mix as his fifth element, not because he wanted to add it to his cupcake but because he was hungry.)The Peer Judging: When work time had elapsed, teen chefs were instructed to put down their materials and plate their best cupcake to be judged. Each teen was then given two popsicle sticks. These popsicle sticks were used to cast peer votes; each teen had two votes, and each teen could only vote for his or her own creation once. Teens were instructed to look at all the creations in the room and then cast their votes based on best appearance and best fidelity to book inspiration. These votes were then tallied while teens ate one of their other cupcakes.The Official Judging: One by one, each teen brought his or her formally plated cupcake to the judge's table for presentation. Teen chefs were asked about their book inspiration and how that translated into their cupcake creation. Judges sliced into each cupcake and tried a small piece for taste.The Awards: After tallying peer votes and conferring over appearance and taste, the official judges announced four winning cupcakes: the top two peer-voted creations, the tastiest book-to-cupcake interpretation, and the most daring cupcake. Our peer-voted winners were a cupcake based on The Maze and one based on I'd Tell You I Love You But Then I'd Have to Kill You. The tastiest went to the cupcake inspired by The Sin-Eater's Confession, and the most daring was definitely the cupcake based on Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (yes, that's marshmallow fluff with bacon bits that you see; not particularly tasty). Each of these four winners posed with their creations before being awarded a rather large, fancy, store-bought cupcake. All participants were able to choose an ARC or leftover summer reading prize book as well just for participating, so everyone left happy.~~*~~We've hosted a number of Iron Chef and Cupcake Wars programs in the past, and interestingly, they tend to attract lots of teens who don't normally frequent library programs. We're not quite sure why this program is so much more appealing to these library-lite teens; have you had any experience with this phenomenon, and to what do you attribute it?Also, any plans to offer a food competition program? Let me tell you, hosting a snacks-themed challenge around the Super Bowl is always a hit."},

{"title": null, "date": "Monday, August 26, 2013", "text": "It's the back-to-school season right now, and the slightly emptier children's section during school hours puts my mind to thinking of the ways we reach kids when they're at school. Partnering with schools doesn't necessarily seem like the most obvious programming decision when local schools are fortunate to have terrific school media specialists, but I am a firm believer that there are many, many things, schools and public libraries can do for one another. We each have different goals and obstacles to reaching those goals, but by working together we can usually find some creative ways to make both our institutions even better.With that motivation in mind, I wanted to share some of the ways my library has partnered with our local schools in the past, and how I'm looking forward to partnering this year:Library presence at local Back to School Fairs - Families in my local school district benefit from two different Back to School Fairs that take place on Saturdays at the beginning of August. The two fairs combined see over 5000 families, and it's a prime forum for community groups and organizations to share information with families. Many families attend because the fairs include distribution of free school supplies, but I love when they stop by my library table and find out what other great programs and resources are available to them for free. These back-to-school events are also great for promoting upcoming big-ticket programs, like our fall author programs with Peter Brown, Brandon Mull, and Maggie Stiefvater.Library presence at School Literacy Nights - I've talked about my visits to \"Title I\" nights previously.Taking library programming to the schools - I visit schools every spring to promote the public library's annual summer reading program, but I also recently started bringing some STEM programming to special education classrooms.Bringing students into the public library - I love when school groups come visit the library for research visits. We have a number of parochial schools in my community, and several of them don't have library collections suited to research projects of older elementary-age students. They arrange field trips to the library to fill this need, and I love interacting with these students. I usually tell a story to get them in a comfy, enjoy-the-library mood, then I explain how the books are organized and how to search for resources they need for projects. We also talk a bit about electronic resources before they head into the stacks to do research. I've also talked previously about how my branch library partners with a local elementary school to showcase students' work from art class in the library.Book Discussions - I'm looking forward to book discussions with groups of interested students at the local elementary schools. Both the school media specialist and I attend and facilitate discussion, and our partnership also entails the public library helping provide discussion sets of books while the school media specialist coordinates readers between monthly meetings. Our discussions can vary from a year of genre exploration to mock awards, but regardless of the books the students develop extraordinary skills for thinking and talking about books.Supporting Staff - My local school district has a professional development day every spring, and for the past few years they've invited folks from the library to talk to all of the school media specialists. This past spring, I was charged with introducing some readers' advisory resources that teachers can access from school with their public library cards. The public library is happy to share access to tremendous resources like NoveList, which schools often cannot justify paying for on their own. I also talk to my local school media specialists about what sorts of information I can provide to them and/or their students regarding library resources, and I am happy to provide workshops as needed.The nature of partnerships is such that I feel sure additional projects will pop up during this current school year, and I hope that schedules allow me to do whatever I can to support our local schools. Students and teachers need resources, the public library wants more community members to know about and use the library... school partnerships allow us both to meet our goals. I may not spend much time in local school buildings, but my work absolutely connects back to schools. And that's a very good thing.~~*~~How do you partner with schools?"},
{"title": null, "date": "Friday, August 23, 2013", "text": "This past Wednesday, I worked a split shift. In the morning I was out of sorts. My state of mind had nothing to do with customers or colleagues, just allergies, but I hated feeling like I was in a funk. That evening, however, I was in the zone. My search queries quickly returned great results, I helped save school documents in the nick of time, and I rocked some readers' advisory conversations with middle graders. By the time we were ready to close, the library quiet, I started to think on my two very different states of mind during the day and whether how we feel affects the service we provide.Doing all we can means pickingup on customers' needs--even ifthey haven't figured them out yet.You see, in the evening, a mom came into the library with her preschool-aged daughter. The mother needed to get a library card so she could use our computers for a little while, and her little girl was about to have a meltdown at the prospect of sitting next to the computer for what is, in kid-time, eons. In this particular instance, the library's level of busyness allowed me to give this girl a few minutes of attention to get her acclimated to the library and engaged in something. I asked her if she'd like me to bring some toys over by the computer for her to play with--and of course she said yes. Off I went to the children's area, grabbing an alphabet machine, a magna doodle, and a wordless picture book, and I brought them to a table adjacent to the computer where her mother was working on something important. I showed the girl how she could make up the words to the story that was just pictures, and when she asked for crayons and paper to draw her own story, I grabbed them from the reference desk. Meltdown averted, little girl engaged in self-directed activities right next to mom doing the work she needed to do. That five minute, full-attention interaction with the young girl saved the whole library from hearing bored whining for an hour while mom was on the computer, and it made mom feel successful in her library visit.My question is, do we always do all we can for our customers? Even if we're not feeling like our patience tanks are 100% full? Even if the customer interaction isn't driven by a question or even an address to a staff member? Or do we do just enough for everyone to be superficially satisfied? My questions kind of relate to that Reference 101 scenario: a customer asks if you have a book on x topic; you could say \"No\" and leave it at that, or you could say \"We do not have a book, but let's look in our databases for some good information.\" Both technically answer the question. But are we doing all we can?Perhaps this whole post--sorry if it's not that exciting or idea-driven--is a way of reminding myself to always ask myself that question: am I doing everything I can here? Am I trying to respond to unspoken questions or concerns, or am I ignoring them because they aren't formally part of the reference interaction? In particular, am I doing all I can for the children who use my library who may not even know what to ask for, or how to express what they want or what they're feeling?Doing all we can for our customers can be hard some days, easier on others. But doing all we can does wonders for building a sense of comfort between the library and its customers, a sense that the library is a place they want to spend time and where staff care. I like to think that's the sort of library we all want to work in--one where we'll happily move some items from the children's area when a caregiver has computer work and a kid needs something to do. Next time I'm having a cranky allergy day, that's what I'll be reminding myself."},
{"title": null, "date": "Wednesday, August 21, 2013", "text": "Last summer, when my library district's teen department put together our first all-TAB lock-in--an after-hours event for members of the various branches' Teen Advisory Boards--we had an inkling that it would go over well. And it did; these library-loving teens were psyched to have an exclusive library experience just for them and their peers. So of course we realized we'd need to offer the program again this summer. Which we did, last weekend.Once again, we had two requirements for teens who wanted to attend our after-hours (although not overnight) lock-in: 1) they needed to be an active member of on of the branch Teen Advisory Boards; and 2) they needed a permission slip signed by a parent or guardian. We also asked that teens bring to the library a non-perishable food item to donate to a local food pantry, although that part was optional. Lest you think our teens are slackers, let me tell you our stats: our 74 attending teens donated a total of 115 food items.Those 74 teens enjoyed a packed schedule of activity options, and they had plenty of time to socialize with like-minded teens who frequent different branch libraries than theirs. Here's the schedule we put together for the teens:6:30 - 7:30 p.m.: Check teens in, Go over ground rules, Have dinner     Two of our teen services staff members took on the task of checking in all 74 teens as they arrived, checking their names against our permission slip records. Kids mingled until the pizzas showed up, at which point a long but polite line formed and everyone chowed down. After dinner, another staff member made staff introductions, shared the night's schedule, and went over ground rules (basically, be nice and don't go in off-limit areas).TARDIS and BMO creation in progress7:30 - 9:00 p.m.: Activity Stations     We had a number of activity stations going on simultaneously, and the teens could move from activity to activity as they so desired:     1) Crafts: I printed out Doctor Who and Adventure Time papercrafts and had scissors & tape available     2) Adventure Time Marathon     3) Videogaming: Word on the street is that a few teen boys got really into a dance game     4) Games: Some teen services staff prepared two different games: Minute to Win It challenges, and also a music game requested by the various branches' Music Clubs. Prizes included galleys and left over summer reading prize books.9:00 - 9:15 p.m.: Egg Hunt--in the dark!     Between the library closing at 6 and teens arriving at 6:30, a few staff members and I hid over 200 plastic eggs stuffed with candy throughout the stacks. We figured out how many eggs each teen could get in the first go-round, then announced that it was a free-for-all for the leftovers. Have you tried hunting eggs in the dark? Not as easy as you might think.9:15 - 10:15 p.m.: All TAB Meeting     It's really important to these kids that they get the chance to share feedback with one another and find new ideas to bring back to their individual branches, which makes this all-TAB meeting a vital part of our lock-in. The head teen services librarian made up an agenda of topics for individual branch TABs to discuss, and after 20 minutes the disparate TABs reunited to share their ideas and thoughts with one another. I know my branch's TAB always returns to their next meeting with many ideas for changes and additions to how they do things. (Note: I was one of two staff members present at the lock-in who are not the person directly in charge of teen programming at our branches; while our colleagues facilitated the TAB meeting, we cleaned up.)10:15 - 10:30 p.m.: Late Night Check-out     Teens all but demanded we have the check-out computers on and ready to go so they could check out books at the lock-in. We hold the lock-in at the branch with the largest young adult section, so many of the teens are in awe at the plethora of reading options in front of them. Our 74 teens checked out 99 items in that 15-minute stretch of time.That's one way to carryanother weapon...10:30 - 11:45 p.m.: Glow-in-the-Dark Capture the Flag     Long story short: there would have been a riot had we not played glow-in-the-dark capture the flag. I explained the rules and took our group photo before staff split the TABs into two teams (keeping whole branches together). Both teams asked for about 15 minutes of team strategizing before the game officially began. As with last year, one team's home base was the children's wing, the other team's area was the adult wing, and the neutral zone was the lobby and check-out area in between. Staff were armed with Nerf guns and crossbows, and any teen hit by our ammo had to go immediately to jail. Let me stress this point: teens get really into this game. They have complicated attack plans, evasive maneuvers, spies... it can get really involved. This year, both teams hid their flags so well (ahem--kind of cheated, albeit equally) that it took the full 60 minutes of gameplay to have a winner. Intense.11:45 - 11:55 p.m.: Door Prize Drawing, Gathering of personal belongings     As each teen entered the lock-in, they added their names to a drawing basket. About a dozen teens were randomly selected as winners in the drawing, and they could choose from a variety of Barnes and Noble gift cards and signed hardback books. Can I tell you how excited it made me to see how excited teens were to win any of these items?12:00 a.m.: Teens picked up     All of the teens were picked up by their appointed rides by 12:15 a.m., with library staff monitoring the pick-up process. At that point, all that was left for we staff members was to finish tidying up, put stray items in the lost and found, take out the trash, and lock up.I am really thrilled with how this second annual All-TAB Lock-in went. The teens had fun, made new friends, and experienced the library in a way that pretty much no one else gets to do. Sure, there's a good amount of planning and staff time that goes into putting on the event, but the teens' sense of ownership in the library after attending hushes any questions of whether it's worth it. Oh, it's worth it."},
{"title": null, "date": "Monday, August 19, 2013", "text": "School has started up again 'round these parts, so I wasn't sure what sort of a crowd to expect for my August Milk & Cookies Story Morning. Are families recovering from the school-induced sleep schedule shift, or are they looking for things to do as a family on the weekend? Seeing as I had the largest crowd at this Saturday morning program since I started it in the spring, I'd say folks were falling into the latter category. Our big group, a combination of new and familiar faces, enjoyed a rousing program:Opening Song: \"Open, Shut Them\"Story: The Baby That Roared! by Simon Puttock     This story about a deer couple who adopt a baby (who turns out to be a monster) is both funny and sweet. Okay, there's a big, two-page spread burp in there, so it's mostly funny. It's a slightly longer tale, but the way the pictures are laid out allows plenty of opportunity for getting the kids to interact and think about what they see on the page.Song: \"The Monster Boogie\" from Laurie Berkner     Nothing quite wakes up a body in the a.m. like marching around the room with monster claws ready, teeth bared, and roaring. That's what we did, and the fun, interactive song really got all of the kids moving.Song: \"I Know a Chicken\" by Laurie Berkner     This is one of my favorite egg shaker songs, as evidenced by the fact that I use it in many different program scenarios. Kids get excited as soon as they hear me grab the bag of egg shakers, and older preschoolers get really into trying to shake their eggs in the different ways the song suggests. Younger kids have fun figuring out how the shakers make noise, then put that knowledge to work.App: Where is My Baby? by Simms Taback, from CJ Educations     I used this app more like a picture walk interlude than a start-to-finish story--that's the mood my kiddos were in, and this app's setup obliges. Using the images from the app, which were projected on our large tv screen, I asked what animal was looking for her baby. Then the children guessed where the baby might be before I touched the iPad screen to bring the baby into view. Everyone chimed in making the appropriate animal sounds. This app might not have held the whole group's attention had I used it in its full form, but it definitely kept kids interested and engaged for four rounds of animals.Our Song CubeSong: \"If You're Happy and You Know It\"     A roll of our song cube told us we'd be singing this song, and I pulled out my ukulele to accompany our singing, clapping, stomping, and hooray-ing. Pretty much every kid was up and dancing.Story: Henny-Penny     I told the story of Henny-Penny, and I encouraged children to chime in on the refrain of \"The sky is falling!\" Many of them did join in, but as our large group began to get restless, I left off a few animals in my telling to speed along the resolution. I had books with Henny-Penny's story available for check-out, so kids who got really into the story could take the full version home.Milk and Cookies Time!     This month's cookies were Trader Joe's Cinnamon Schoolbook Cookies, small cookies cut in the shapes of letters and numbers. As I passed out a few cookies to each child, I encouraged them to figure out what letters and numbers they had on their napkins. Quite a few children were excited to find they had the first letter of their names.Free Play Time     August's free play session would probably rank as the best so far in terms of engagement by pretty much everyone in the room. Caregivers were down at the play tables with their kids (and other kids, too) asking questions, helping put together monsters, demonstrating our magnet wands, and assisting with shape puzzles. With so many kids in the room, it seemed like the children were more comfortable interacting with their peers than in months past. There was a core group of hard-core players, too, who stayed almost 45 minutes after the story time portion of the program to let their imaginations run free. I'm currently reading Vivian Gussin Paley's A Child's Work: The Importance of Fantasy Play for the Storytime Underground Book Club, and it was very exciting for me to see my library kids engaging in that sort of fantasy play at the program. I very much want our library to present ample opportunities for this vital developmental practice."},
{"title": null, "date": "Friday, August 16, 2013", "text": "After the high-energy success of my first Preschool Dance Party last winter, I knew I needed to fit another dance party into my programming schedule. What better time than at the end of the summer, when kids have energy to burn after exhausting all their regular summertime activities?Once again, this dance party was an exemplary program. All of the children were engaged at a level comfortable for them--some marched around the whole time, some clapped from the safety of Mom's lap, but everyone got involved. The program helped draw attention to two wonderful but often-overlooking collections at the library, our children's music CDs and our Rhymes and Songs picture books. Packing the fast-paced program with early literacy tips about the importance of singing and playing also helped caregivers recognize that reading isn't the only way to help kids develop early literacy skills. All in all, a great program (and a great workout for me).Preschool Dance PartySong: \"Surfin' Safari\" by the Beach Boys     We used this song to get our bodies warmed up and break the ice for an atypical story time experience. We did lots of arm stretches and careful leg lifts to get everyone pumped.Song: \"Do the Bird\" by the Kerplunks     This song includes listening to hear the different motions to make. The kids' favorite verse was when they acted like chickens.Story: The Croaky Pokey by Ethan Long     This silly variation of the Hokey Pokey is particularly exciting to kids, as they get to make froggy tongue-slurping sounds as they try to catch flies along with the text.Song: \"Mahna Mahna\" by Mahna Mahna and the Snowths     I passed out rhythm sticks for this song, and we had fun trying to keep a beat, making our sticks sound loud and then soft, and trying to keep our sticks in rhythm while beating them behind our backs.Song: \"Robot Parade\" by They Might Be Giants     The kids and I practiced our robot movements before I pressed play for this song, and then we robot-ed all around the room in a very stiff and silly-looking parade. This song wins the award for inspiring the most caregiver photos.Song: \"Beanie Bag Dance\" by Greg & Steve     Each child got to choose a Beanie Baby animal to use for this song. The song instructs listeners what to do with their bean bags, including dancing with bags between one's knees.Story: If You're Hoppy by April Pulley Sayre     I stuck with the silly variation of kids classics book theme and shared this great animal-heavy picture book. Most kids opted to stay standing for the book, so there was lots of acting out the behaviors of the animals.Song: \"Shoo Fly\" by Carole Peterson     We had a great time doing the shoo-ing motions for this song. As several of the kids were getting a bit tired at this point, we shared this song sitting criss-cross-applesauce on the floor, moving our arms and rocking to the beat.Song: \"Movin' Right Along\" by Alkaline Trio     I pulled out the parachute for this song, and the kids and I worked on shaking the parachute at different speeds. We also worked on rotating the parachute in a circle using teamwork.Song: \"Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy\" by the Andrews Sisters     I added some blow-up globes (beach ball-style) onto the middle of the parachute, which of course inspired much excited shaking and bouncing. We again used teamwork to count together and make the globes go really high, much to everyone's delight. When the song ended, I told kids to let go of the parachute when I counted to three so I could wrap the parachute up.~~*~~Have you done a preschool dance party program?

{"title": null, "date": "Wednesday, August 14, 2013", "text": "It happens to all of us at some point: we get sick on the day of one of our carefully planned programs. That's what happened to my co-worker this week--she ended up sick on the day of her Time for Twos story time program.Sick days leave story time fill-ins two options: 1) use the sick coworker's program plan and do their best to offer a story time the group would recognize; or 2) leave the coworker's plan for her return and instead put together an emergency story time program. Both answers can be correct depending on individual programming style. Since I'm a particularly free-style story time leader, I tend to choose option 2.Putting together emergency story times, when it comes down to it, is really about being comfortable with your programming repertoire. We have all read so many books and sung so many songs and led so many rhymes and created so many crafts. Emergency story times mean pulling program components from your collective experience to create a sure-to-please, or at least sure-not-to-stink, program. No need to have a cohesive theme--when the regular story time leader is sick and the kiddos are confronted with a new face at the story time helm, the option of a \"regular\" story time is kind of nonexistent. It's all about having fun early literacy experiences in this already out-of-the-ordinary story time setting.Here's what I pulled together for my emergency story time for two-year-olds this week:I grabbed some books that two-year-olds love, hands down. I always have success with Bill Martin, Jr. titles, so I grabbed one that was on the shelf: Baby Bear, Baby Bear, What Do You See? I also love the Cat the Cat series from Mo Willems, which are perfect length, vocabulary, and content for young preschoolers, so I pulled Cat the Cat, Who Is That? from the stacks. I rounded out my book offerings with a title plucked from our \"colors\" concept bins: who hasn't had success with I Went Walking?I rounded up some musical and fingerplay options that would be both familiar and exciting to the two-year-olds. That meant, first and foremost, that I grabbed my song cube out of my personal story time bin; a toss of the song cube determines which child-friendly song we sing as a group. Today's random selections were \"Head, Shoulders, Knees, and Toes\" and \"Five Little Ducks.\" I also pulled a coworker's go-to Greg and Steve CDs out of her story time bin (don't worry, I put them back!). Animal stories meant doing at least one \"Animal Actions\" song. Interactive hits, all of these.I grabbed some craft supplies. I am all about the process crafts, and I love explaining to caregivers that process crafts offer so many more creative, exploratory, and diverse motor skills benefits than ready-made product crafts. Process crafts are also simple to put together on the fly, as they only really necessitate basic supplies. I pulled from our craft cabinet some zipper-lock plastic bags, cardstock, and fingerpaint, and our activity was un-messy fingerpainting using primary colors. I got to share with caregivers that their children were strengthening finger muscles that will help with writing while also exploring how paint feels and how colors combine.I stuck to my co-worker's opening and closing routines. My co-worker greets her twos by saying hello to each of them in a sing-song voice and waving. I did this same routine to help make the transition into story time, and I also explained that Miss Melanie was sick so Miss Amy would share some books and other fun things on this day. At the end of story time, I turned on our bubble machine; our regular Time for Twos programs always end with the bubble machine turned on for kids to enjoy. Ending with the bubble machine made the transition out of story time a smooth one, as kiddos are used to playing in the bubbles and then heading back into the library after they were done.~~*~~How do you approach emergency fill-in story time situations?"},

{"title": null, "date": "Friday, August 9, 2013", "text": "The new Percy Jackson movie was released this week, and at the suggestion of several members of my Kids Advisory Board, I offered a Percy Jackson Party program to celebrate the fans of both the books and films. This program took place at the tail end of summer reading, which means I had no guarantees about the amount of prep time I would have for the program. What better occasion for utilizing the unprogramming method?Percy Jackson PartySomething Literary: I started the program by greeting the school-age children and launching right into our literary content for the program. We talked a bit about what we like about the Percy Jackson series, and from there I booktalked some readalike authors and titles. I made sure to display non-fiction books on Greek mythology as well as the fiction titles I shared--after all, the basis of many characters' backstories in the Percy Jackson books come straight from these ancient myths.I then told a Greek myth: the story of Theseus and the Minotaur. I love exercising my storytelling chops with old tales like these; since the stories were originally part of an oral storytelling culture, they work really well when told aloud in library programs. Some of the children had already heard the tale of Theseus and the half-man, half-beast Minotaur, but they were interested in my telling just the same.A Group Activity: I had set out a few tables in a long, single-table arrangement, and each table had all the supplies for painting. Our craft activity was to paint shields (cardboard cake rounds + ribbon + brads = a shield with a handle). I introduced the activity by noting that ancient warriors used their shields not only as a means of protecting themselves in battle, but also as a way to distinguish themselves to others. Shields often had very personal carvings and decorations that reflected the personality and life of the shield-bearer.Stations of Stuff: With the help of two teen volunteers, there were three stations through which kids could rotate to engage in Percy Jackson-relevant activities. Children were free to move from station to station as they pleased.Feeding the Cerberus - I cut a hole in a piece of particle board and added a picture of the three-headed hound that guards the Underworld to create this game station. Kids used soft balls meant for the pool to try and feed the Cerberus by tossing the balls at the opening.Archery Against the Gorgons - I printed and laminated three pictures of Gorgons, the mythological evil sisters with snakes for hair. Children used our library's Nerf crossbows to try to defeat the Gorgons.Greek Gods & Goddesses Go Fish - I made a full deck of cards bearing the images, names, and descriptors of major Greek gods and goddesses. I helped at this station, as not all of the children were familiar with \"go fish,\" but everyone quickly caught on and the game became quite popular. So popular, in fact, that we wrapped up the program with a massive game, everyone seated on the ground around our story time rug.Stations of Stuff is a perfect arrangement for larger group programs like this one; since children are able to move from activity to activity at their own pace, they never feel bored or left out in the middle of an activity. There's always something for everyone to do, including going back to the craft table to add more detail to one's shield.That was our Percy Jackson Party program. You may be thinking that I didn't do much that tied explicitly to plot points in the Percy Jackson universe, but that was intentional on my part. The kids who have read the books and/or seen the movies were excited to talk about PJ with their peers, but kids who weren't familiar with the PJ universe never felt left out because they didn't know trivia or specific plot points. Everyone got to have fun and engage in activities that expanded beyond the book, hopefully piquing interest in other readalike books or in mythology.Have you offered a Percy Jackson program at your library? What sorts of activities did you do?"},
{"title": null, "date": "Wednesday, August 7, 2013", "text": "Not too long ago, librarian Kary Henry tweeted that she had just hosted a successful unprogram. She shared a few details on Twitter, and I knew immediately that we'd all benefit from hearing more about this program. Without further ado, here's guest blogger Kary Henry!~~*~~When I first heard of Marge Loch-Wouters’s and Amy Koester’s Unprogramming approach, my first reaction was “What?  Let go of control?  No way!”  I’m the ultimate control freak (although I prefer the term “thorough planner”), and their idea just didn’t fit my preconceived notion of programming.  But, like most brilliant ideas, it wouldn’t let go of me.  I kept coming back to phrases from their first two blogs on the topic:  “We spend a lot of time and energy in planning” and “You never know just how many kids will participate.”  Marge and Amy talked about stress, and I remembered past programs where I had Every. Single. Minute. scheduled, and then I either had low turnout or, worse, no turnout!  I decided to take that leap of faith and do my “Fantasy Maps” program as an Unprogram.  And, as Amy wrote, “EUREKA!”My daughters and I used to create “fairy maps” when they were little. That effort consisted of nothing more than going for a walk to gather twigs, pebbles, and fallen flower petals.  Lots of glue on a piece of heavy paper, crayon-inscribed labels to identify the Rose Fairy’s house or other key features, and everyone was happy.  I would use that same low-key, unprogramming approach to Fantasy Maps, a school-age program I had designed for our Summer Reading Program theme of “Have Books – Will Travel!”Now if I’m totally honest with you (and myself), I had indeed been thinking about this program since February.  I had gathered some important information about cartography, emailed another librarian in Illinois who was running a similar event, and put a good deal of thought into what I wanted to do.  But the Unprogramming approach saved me from myself and allowed me the freedom to put the focus into what the kids wanted to do!  (Slap self on head and mutter, “Duh.”)The décor consisted of maps of fantasy books/worlds that I had located on Pinterest and other websites:  Oz, Narnia, the worlds of Harry Potter, etc.  I gathered some books on mapmaking along with fictional titles that had maps on endpapers and displayed those on the counter.  The laptop and projector were set to run National Geographic’s Interactive map website.Supplies were purchased at a local craft store or found in our cabinets:  silk flower petals, aluminum foil, craft sticks, colored pencils and markers, ribbons, colored pebbles, Bristol board, and good glue.  Total cost for the program was under $30!When the children arrived, we talked for a few minutes about what a map is, why we use them, parts of a map (scale, legend, compass rose, color), and how a fantasy map can be based on a book  or of a world in their own imaginations.  We mapped Deerfield using the National Geographic website, and they were excited to put their homes, schools and, of course, the Library on the map.  Less than 15 minutes in to the program, I let them loose with a piece of Bristol board each and the above supplies.The conversations as my teen volunteers and I walked around the room were wonderful – discussions about what was important to include on a map of Harry Potter or how to combine HP with the world of Rick Riordan, even how best to make a pirate ship out of cut-up craft sticks and a bit of ribbon.   Some children chose to use the supplies to create relief maps; others used the colored pencils and markers only.  The kids were excited and proud to pose with their maps.  Forty-five minutes later, as the adults returned, their children didn’t want to leave!My first attempt at an Unprogram had been just as Marge and Amy hinted it would be:  relaxed, kid-focused, and wildly successful.  I’m already looking at how to continue to use this approach in future events and in my early literacy storytime sessions.  For me, Unprogramming has become the ultimate in programming!Kary Henry is a Youth Services Associate at the Deerfield (IL) Public Library.

{"title": null, "date": "Monday, August 5, 2013", "text": "Almost a year ago, I included Mixing in Math in a post listing where I get my program inspiration. I still count Mixing in Math as one of my top resources for the math component of my STEAM programs and services, and I wanted to highlight some of the great content they offer that may help you to STEAM, too.Mixing in Math is an initiative from TERC, a Cambridge, MA-based non-profit center for math and science education. Part of their core philosophy is that \"daily life is full of opportunities to explore math,\" and that holds true for all ages of people. As a result, Mixing in Math's resources work great with school-age children specifically, although there are many preschool applications. Mixing in Math boasts a number of projects and resources to help educators, caregivers, and librarians turn these daily math exploration opportunities into meaningful math learning through fun games and activities.Some of my favorite resources available from Mixing in Math:Monthly calendars -- These calendars, with general monthly themes like \"weather,\" \"nutrition,\" and \"poetry,\" can be used in a number of ways. They are printable, so librarians can share them directly with families. They are also a great place to find simple ideas for math activities to add at the beginning or end of a program. Calendars are available in English and Spanish.Lots of activities -- These activities share ideas for math concept learning with step-by-step instructions. Their \"Height Museum\" is a terrific preschool measuring activity; the \"So Sweet\" experiment would be a hit science-experiment-and-math activity with school-age kids. These activities are available in English and Spanish.Newsletter -- Want tons of ideas for simple math activities delivered to your e-mail monthly? Then subscribe to the newsletter. I always find useful activity ideas.Printable Posters -- These posters pose questions about the animal kingdom, space, and creativity, and they encourage kids to use library resources to find answers to mathematical questions like \"How many giant pandas live in the wild?\" Math and suggested use of print and electronic resources? Love it.An archived training webinar -- This hour-long archived webinar perfectly blends the motivations behind Mixing in Math with practical activity and program ideas--both active and passive--that work well in libraries. I left the original webinar with tons of ideas for mixing in math at my library, and the webinar content definitely holds up.Food Fights, Puzzles, and Hideouts -- This book from Mixing in Math and Tumblehome Learning combines some tried-and-true older activities with tons of new games and projects developed just for the book. The content includes games, projects and crafts, food activities, group activities, and \"Anytime, Anywhere\" activities as well as listings of activity ideas by month. The back of the book also features information on how the different activities fit in with Common Core standards across K-5. This resource would make a great addition to non-circulating professional collections as well as homeschooler or teacher resource circulating collections.Essentially, Mixing in Math exists to help make clearer and more impactful the sorts of math-rich activities we already do; it helps us adults be more intentional in developing kids' math skills through our interactions with them. Does that sound familiar? I think librarians can draw a strong parallel between ECRR for early literacy and Mixing in Math for math: both initiatives offer practitioners ideas for maximizing the skills-development impact of the activities we do with kids, and both equip practitioners to impart tips and sound bites about the importance of these skills to caregivers.Have you used Mixing in Math? I'd love to hear how you get this great STEAM resource to work for you."},

Long story short: teens respect Angie as a staff member while also enjoying her company and conversation. Which makes programs like the one she's sharing here work really, really well.Teen Chat & ChewI just had a wonderful program called \"Chat & Chew: Coffee and Donuts Edition.\" Eight teenagers attended the morning program, and it was soooo much fun!In preparation for the program--to make sure we had plenty of books to talk about--I pulled books from the list of titles that teens discussed at the BFYA session at ALA.  I also pulled books from Debra Hipes's lists, etc.During the program, we discussed and read from books.  I had large sticky notes on the walls with a few topics: what everyone was currently reading, best reads of the summer, and titles the teens were eager to read after hearing what their peers had to say about them. Here's a peek at some of the lists:Top Teen Summer Books    2013:SUPER HUMAN by Michael Owen CarrollTHIS BOOK IS NOT GOOD FOR YOU by Pseudonymous BoschDEEPLY ODD by Dean R.  KoontzSHINE by Lauren MyracleSCARLET by Marissa MeyerDR. BIRD'S ADVICE FOR SAD POETS by Evan RoskosTHE GLITCH TRILOGY by Heather AnastasiuLENOBIA’S VOW by P.C.

What I love about these Teen Chat & Chew programs is that they are a) literacy focused and b) completely open-ended. There's space for conversation to develop along whatever lines interest the attendees, but everyone leaves having heard about great titles regardless of the direction of conversation. The program also involves little staff prep--books are pulled ahead of time and prompts are considered in case chatter wanes. Also, the only expense is the \"chew\" component; and goodness knows you must always feed the teens.What results from these simple components is a safe space for teens to talk about books they love, issues they're thinking about (there's often an impromptu LGBT thread in these programs), and their personal interests. Hey, they even feel comfortable enough to not only read their own writing aloud, but to request a writing club program as well. These teens spend so many programs and volunteer interactions listening to us, the library staff; I love that we can offer programs in which we have ample opportunity to listen to them."},
{"title": null, "date": "Wednesday, July 31, 2013", "text": "My colleague Miss Melanie usually presents programming for two-year-olds at my branch, but when she took a well-earned vacation last week, I stepped in to lead her program (Note: I like to plan my own content if I have advance notice, but I of course will follow a colleague's program plan if asked/in called-in-sick situations). Seeing a new face at the front of the story time room can be a bit jarring for many toddlers who grow accustomed to the way things usually run, so I packed my story time with tons of interactive activities to keep everyone engaged and happy. Here's what I did:\"I Spy\" Story TimePre-program: As I am notoriously awful at names, I found some paper dessert-size plates and wrote on them the names of the children who were registered to attend. I asked kids and caregivers to find their nameplates as they came in. (Turns out, these kids held on tight to their nameplates the whole program. They loved them.)Opening Greeting: Miss Melanie usually greets her kiddos with a sort of chant: \"Hello, ______!\" (Think \"Let's go, Blackhawks!\"). I replicated this greeting for each child, and I got all of the names correct because of the aforementioned pre-program nameplates.Songs: These two-year-olds regularly sing a few songs in their program; the repetition from week to week is important for establishing a level of comfort and familiarity to story time, and it also gives two-year-olds the opportunity to actually learn a song instead of just miming the story time leader. We shared:\"Where is Thumbkin?\"\"Head, Shoulders, Knees, & Toes\"Stories: I gauged the level of audience engagement to figure out the best time to share our stories. Both stories involve kids using their hands to create a spyglass (or telescope, or binoculars) so they can help spy items in the book's pages.I Spy on the Farm by Edward GibbsShark in the Park! by Nick SharrattActivities:I Spy What Animals Eat - Using green poster board, green cardstock, Velcro dots, and pieces from my library's assorted flannelboard collection, I put together bushes with foods hiding under the leaves; sometimes the foods were fruits, other times they were pizza or muffins. After demonstrating an elephant and a zebra hand puppet who like to find and eat fruit, I passed out puppets to let the kids help their animals spy what they wanted to eat. Kids would lift the leaf flaps to spy the foods in the bushes.Parachute Time - With our good-sized group, caregivers helped me move the parachute over the kids' heads as they explored underneath. After one round of \"Colors Over You,\" one child got it in his mind to try to use the parachute as a slip-n-slide. Thus it was time to put the parachute away.I Spy Bottles - Using a model similar to Brooke's, I created I Spy bottles filled with beads for kids to turn and observe. I used bottles of craft sand for the container, and I mixed in beads that looked like animals as well as letter beads. I superglued those lids shut, and they've held up so far. Some of the kids were absolutely mesmerized by the activity of turning the bottles and looking at the different hidden items.Craft: For our group process art craft, we focused on fine motor skills by sticking different colors and shapes of stickers on our own spyglasses (paper towel tubes).Bubbles! It's a tradition in our twos programming to end with the bubble machine. The kids really look forward to seeing, playing in, and popping the bubbles, and the bubbles serve to gently signal that story time is ending."},
{"title": null, "date": "Monday, July 29, 2013", "text": "I had a meeting last week with some local homeschooling parents. The purpose of the meeting was to open up lines of communication between the library and these library customers--to start a discussion about what expectations we have for one another, and the sorts of services the library is equipped to provide.To support this conversation and give parents a reference for what the library offers to their children, my library district came up with a Menu of Library Services for Children & Teens. This one page, front-and-back document highlights the variety of programs and services available to all families and groups in the community. It mentions preschool, school-age, and teen programs that the library offers on an ongoing basis; reference and interlibrary loan services; meeting room reservations; and downloadable resources ranging from ebooks and eaudio to magazines and music.The part of this menu that was of most interest to the parents with whom I met, however, was the section describing available programs for groups. Every parent in this meeting had been unaware of the types of programs the library is equipped to offer upon request (with some restrictions for availability and staffing). We can offer:Library Tours -- We can customize a tour to fit the ages and needs of the group, throw in a story, and wrap everything up with a learning-reinforcing scavenger hunt.Book Group Events -- We can facilitate a discussion where every child has read the same book; we can facilitate a discussion wherein children talk about the different books they've read (peer reviews are great for inspiring reluctant readers!); and we can host events bursting with librarian-led book talks to entice readers.Electronic Resources Workshops -- We can offer information- and resource-specific workshops that give children exposure to and practice with any of the library's diverse electronic databases.Speakers -- Three branches in my district boast librarian specialists in health resources, business and nonprofit resources, and genealogy and local history, and these specialists can give presentations on their subject areas. We also have librarians equipped to talk about storytelling, early literacy, and finding \"just right reads.\"These a la carte menu items, if you will, were a delightful surprise for the homeschooling parents with whom I met. These are the sorts of library services they want--getting their kids acclimated to the library and how it works, exploring in-depth research options--but had previously been unaware of.I'm excited that my library district now has a formal, printed menu of services that librarians like me can use as a reference when having conversations with caregivers interested in finding out what's available for their kids. Even more than that, however, I'm excited that we've opened the lines of communication between the library and a core group of our heavy users, homeschooling families. The more we understand one another, the better our relationship will be."},
{"title": null, "date": "Friday, July 26, 2013", "text": "I had a great conversation with a library mom the other day. She came to tell me how much her son enjoys the school-age science programs at my branch, and she asked if I had heard of something called STEAM--STEM with an A. Oh, boy. Do I need to tell you how excited I was to have a conversation about STEAM, one of my favorite things in the whole wide world, with this enthusiastic customer? It was great! And even better, I was able to tell her about our upcoming STEAM programs--including Playground Adventures, which she brought her son to after our conversation. I love when these sorts of interactions happen.But let's talk about Playground Adventures. My thought process for the program was to combine some information about and examples of simple machines with a hands-on crafty/building/making activity. After I attended a STAR_Net webinar called Playful Building, I knew playgrounds were the perfect premise for this program.We started off talking about simple machines. I asked the kids in attendance (about a dozen) what they already knew about simple machines, then I talked about some of the common ones. I used everyday objects as examples: inclined track and train from the train table for inclined plane; doorstop for wedge; yo-yo for pulley; catapult for lever. As I talked about and demonstrated each machine, I asked the kids to think about where they might see these machines at work on the playground. They had great ideas.Then we spent the rest of the program time--45 minutes--building our own playgrounds. I set out legal-size paper as the building base, and I assembled a variety of other materials for building as well: different colors of paper, drinking straws, assorted wooden pieces, thimbles, yarn... We had tape and a hot glue gun for assembling playground parts (I wielded the hot glue gun), and markers and colored pencils were available for optional embellishment. These kids spent the entirety of the remaining 45 minutes deep in their building processes, coming up with great playground ideas and very smart engineering problem-solving decisions to build what they had envisioned. The resulting playgrounds were varied and great, and the children described them to me with definite pride.Despite how relatively simple and low-intensity the program was, all of the kids thanked me profusely for offering the program. That response serves to reinforce my belief that one of the key things we (libraries) can provide for children is a space in which they feel comfortable to explore their own ideas."},
{"title": null, "date": "Wednesday, July 24, 2013", "text": "One of my goals in offering children's programs in my branch library is to promote materials in our collection. My colleagues and I do a pretty good job of promoting books, audiobooks, music CDs, and DVDs in our programming, but we hadn't really tapped the videogames collection. This summer, I rectified that deficiency by offering two Mario Kart Tournaments on one of our district's Wiis.I heard from a lot of kids after the program, and they all said they had a fun time having a friendly competition at the library. Lots of kids play Mario Kart at home or on their portable DS consoles, but they don't always get the chance to race other kids--which makes gaming at the library great. Many parents also expressed their thanks at offering the event, which took place over the course of 2.5 hours on a Saturday in June and again in July. It gets pretty darn hot in the summer here, and I love making the library a destination for a cool activity.Here's how I ran the tournament:Practice Rounds - As children entered the program room, I asked them to please fill out notecards with their names and ages. I kept the cards in the order in which children arrived, and that sequence made up the order for our initial practice races. Some teen volunteers helped me set up the Wii so that four children could race at a time; they also set the game so that a \"round\" equalled two games, and while racers could choose their characters and vehicles, the racetrack was selected randomly. Each child got to race two practice races during the first part of our program.The Tournament - Once every child had completed the practice rounds, the tournament began. I created a bracket using those name/age cards I had the kids fill out, and I made the bracket pairings by ages. Thus, in the first round of the tournament, 6-year-olds were racing other 6- and 7-year-olds, 12-year-olds were racing other 12- and 13-year-olds, etc. The tournament happened with the same settings as the practice rounds, which meant each bracket pairing raced on two tracks to determine the overall race winner. That winner would move on to the next bracket, which I again paired by ages. The way Mario Kart keeps score, racing twice means that two players may end up tied for first place; in these instances, both first place racers advanced to the next round of the tournament. We kept progressing through the tournament bracket in this fashion until we were down to the final four-person race.While Kids Were Waiting - I knew that with a large group of children (I had 48 at my June program, 20 at the July), kids would have to wait a while between turns racing. I made plans for them to have plenty to do while they waited:snacks - I had chips, Mario fruit snacks, and drinks available, one each per childwatching/cheering - I set up a close viewing area right in front of the wall where we projected the races, and folks could also sit at tables behind the racers; I did set the only rule, which was \"only cheering, no jeering\"coloring - I had blank paper as well as coloring sheets available; a few kids opted to create certificates for the eventual winnerstrophy creation - our local odds-and-ends store includes a bin of random trophy parts, so I bought a small bag of them and let the kids created their own trophies for the tournament; I explained that the trophies would remain in the library with winners' names nearbyThe Timing - The way the timing breaks down has a lot to do with how many people enter the tournament; set your program capacity so that your tournament lasts the amount of time you want it to. In our two tournaments, not everyone stayed for the whole program; some folks left after they had been eliminated from the tournament, or had grown a bit bored of watching the races.The Winners - I made a big fanfare out of the final round of races, using my best sports announcer voice to give something like a play-by-play. (Note: It's a good thing I'm a librarian and not a sports announcer.) When the winners were evident, I presented the trophies as well as the other pictures and certificates that some of the children had made. Many kids wanted their pictures taken with their trophies, and once that was done, I made name cards to accompany the trophies on their display on a prominent shelf in the library. The trophies are still up on that shelf, proclaiming the names of the tournament winners for all library visitors to see.~~*~~Do you have questions about this program?

{"title": null, "date": "Monday, July 22, 2013", "text": "For this month's edition of my library's Milk & Cookies Story Morning, a great group of mostly 2- to 4-year-olds gathered in the programming room. It's been hot here in Missouri, so families willing to brave the heat to come to the library enjoy getting to relax in our air-conditioned spaces for a while. I'm happy to give them opportunities for hanging around in a program like this:Opening Song: \"Open, Shut Them\"Story: The Watermelon Seed by Greg Pizzoli     This bright, simply illustrated picture book hits on a topic that doesn't seem too far-fetched to most youngsters: a crocodile who loves watermelon accidentally swallows a seed, and he's worried he's got a watermelon growing in his belly. This book offers great opportunities for talking about what seeds need to grow, what happens when you swallow something, etc., as well as a perfect invitation for giggles when the crocodile gives a giant burp.Song: \"We're Going to Kentucky\"     I learned this song at Guerrilla Storytime at #ala2013, and I've used it many times since. For this story morning group, I handed out egg shakers to accompany our shaking as per the song's instructions. We sang the song three times due to its popularity, with the final verse sung quickly enough to prompt us all to fall down dizzy at the end.Story: The Kissing Hand by Audrey Penn, from Oceanhouse Media     This book app shares the story of Chester as his mother helps him overcome his nervousness about going to school. This story has long been a classic for a reason, and I decided to share it this time because preschools will be starting up again soon. I projected the app in its \"Read it Myself\" mode, which allowed me to go through the app at a pace that suited the children in attendance. I read the story with the help of my own Chester raccoon puppet, whose paw the kids enjoyed kissing after the story. How's that for transmedia storytelling?Songs: \"I'm a Little Teapot\" and \"The Itsy Bitsy Spider\"     We rolled the song cube to see what song we would sing next as a group. After twice singing \"I'm a Little Teapot,\" the kids asked to roll the song cube again. I of course obliged, and we launched into an enthusiastic rendition of \"The Itsy Bitsy Spider.\"Story: Little Rabbit Foo Foo by Michael Rosen and Arthur Robins     For the folk/fairytale portion of our story morning, I decided to share this great version of \"Little Bunny Foo Foo,\" a song it appears many children no longer hear from their caregivers. This small book boasts so many fantastic qualities and early literacy opportunities: it's got great vocabulary (\"attitude,\" \"goblins\"); it reinforces counting; it's got a repetitive style that draws kids into participating and helps them remember the story; it can be sung; and it's got a bit of silliness mixed in with the moral.Milk and Cookies Time!     We enjoyed some cinnamon Teddy Grahams and milk immediately after finishing our storytime portion of the morning. Mmm!Free Play Time     As with previous implementations of this program, I set out a variety of my library's educational and open-ended children's toys for the free exploration of the children in attendance. The science station was once again a hit, especially the magnets. Also extremely popular were the library's new alphabet machines, which I decided to purchase after reading a great testimonial about the toys in someone else's library (I can't remember on whose blog I read about it; that bookmark got lost in the transition-from-Google-Reader shuffle. [Update: the original post was on Anna's blog. Thanks to reader Amanda who pointed me to the post!]). I saw kids and caregivers identifying letters, naming images, creating patterns--really, these things are quite versatile.~~*~~How have you been incorporating play for preschoolers at your library this summer?"},
{"title": null, "date": "Friday, July 19, 2013", "text": "This summer, I've been offering a picnic lunch-and-reading program again--this year I opted to call it \"Picnic Lunch @ the Library.\" (See last year's post for full how-to details.) This program tends to draw a smaller crowd; I usually get somewhere between 10 and 20 attendees, including caregivers. The small party of picnickers, however, makes for a relaxing, particularly child-directed program. The kids don't really like one of the stories? Well then, we move along to another.When I was planning the summer program calendar, I decided to name a theme for the books to be shared at each Picnic Lunch @ the Library. As a result, I got two totally different crowds of kids: children were excited for folk and fairy tales when they came to the Fairy Tales Edition, and the animal lovers chose to attend the Animal Tales Edition. Both groups said they enjoyed the quiet time to listen to a bunch of books read aloud. Oh, and they also like that listening to me read for an hour counts toward their summer reading goals.Without further ado, my 2013 Picnic Lunch @ the Library book lists:Fairy TalesPrincess Furball by Charlotte HuckSeven Chinese Brothers by Margaret MahySnow White and Rose Red Jacob GrimmToads and Diamonds by Charlotte HuckThe Princess and the Pea by Hans Christian AndersenAfter each story, the children tried to decide what the moral of each tale was; after all, as one child pointed out, fairy tales always teach some sort of lesson.Animal TalesTarra & Bella by Carol BuckleyOne Cool Friend by Toni BuzzeoUnicorn Thinks He's Pretty Great by Bob Shea (the kiddos wanted to include a mythological animal in the mix)Two Bobbies by Kirby Larson and Mary NetheryMe...Jane by Patrick McDonnellItsy Bitsy & Teeny Weeny by Robbyn Smith van FrankenhuyzenFlora and the Flamingo by Molly IdleWe ended with Flora and the Flamingo, at which point the children wanted to discuss what sorts of music they sometimes hear in their heads when they read different books. I confess I always hear Clair de Lune as I flip through Idle's wordless picture book.~~*~~Do you offer any reading and/or read-aloud programs in conjunction with your summer reading program?"},

{"title": null, "date": "Friday, July 12, 2013", "text": "All this week, Marge Loch-Wouters and I have been recapping our #ala2013 conversation starter on the topic of Unprogramming. Read all our previous posts & join in on the conversation in the comments or on Twitter (#unprogramming).~~*~~So you've got the recipe for unprogramming. Maybe you'd like a few examples of unprograms, ready-to-go or ready-to-modify for your library. Well you are in luck, friend, because Marge and I have been pinning great examples of unprograms onto a board on Pinterest. Some of these pinned programs are our own, and we discussed a few of them in Chicago: a Superhero Party and Attack on the Fort! program from my library, and camp-out, Lego, and space adventures programs from Marge's library. Many of the pinned programs, though, are programs that we've culled from awesome librarians around the country and the blogosphere. And we're not done with this board, either; we're going to keep pinning examples of unprogramming that inspire us, and as a result we hope the Unprogramming Pinterest board will be a useful resource for you.I also want to expand on Marge's post about why unprogramming works by sharing an anecdote--a testimonial, if you will:My library has long had an American Girl Club program, and a few different staffers have been in charge of it over the years. This program has always required meticulous research, both of the characters and of the time period being explored. The staff member planning the program might spend several hours over the course of a month planning time period-appropriate games, crafts, and snacks. Attendance has always been good--around 35, which is on the large side for our location--but entirely female. The girls bring their American Girl dolls, and I've long been afraid we are excluding those who don't have a doll even though we advertise the program as open to everyone.Cut to this spring, when a staff member gave unprogramming a shot. She created a write-up for a Marble Run Mania program, which required collecting a bunch of recyclable materials, some electrical tape, and marbles. Prep time was 20 minutes of program room setup. The program opened with brief discussion of ways to think about building structures; kids had access to books on engineering/building (think David Macaulay). This staff person also used kids' input to make a brief bulleted list of design ideas. Kids then broke into groups to create whatever type of marble run they wanted. The last 10 minutes of the program were open for trying each others' marble runs. Attendance was 57, diverse in age, boys and girls, and the kids were crazy engaged. They loved it. So much less prep time, so much more engagement.So there you have it, the crux of the reason I am a big believer in unprogramming in the library for school-age kids: high engagement, minimal staff overload. I hope I'm not the only librarian to experience this change. I'd love to hear stories from you about what happened when you tried an unprogram.Join Marge and me tomorrow for the final posts in our Unprogramming wrap-up! Thanks for hanging with us this long."},
{"title": null, "date": "Wednesday, July 10, 2013", "text": "Marge Loch-Wouters and I are recapping our 2013 ALA Annual Convention Conversation Starter on Unprogramming in a series of posts. To get caught up, start with posts one and two. Join our ongoing conversation on the topic of Unprogramming by sounding off in the comments or taking to Twitter (don't forget the hashtag #unprogramming).~~*~~So you've decided, now that you know what unprogramming is, that you want to unprogram at your library. Where do you begin?Start by asking yourself one big question: \"How does what I'm doing/what I want to do connect kids to a) a book or books; b) an author or illustrator; c) the library or our services; and/or d) some aspect of kids' interests that can connect back to the library?\" The question seems like a mouthful, but it's pretty straightforward and extremely open-ended. Asking this question from the get-go ensures that your unprograms will connect back to your library's goals and mission; it necessitates that you think about books, reading, the library, literacy, etc., from the very beginning stages of planning. Never again will you have to worry that your program doesn't connect to the library.Thinking broadly by asking yourself this question informs your choices for programs and activities. For example, do you want to offer a program in which kids can gain a sense of comfort and agency at the library? LEGO Club, craft programs, and \"instant artist\" tables can allow you to accomplish this goal simply. If you're looking to connect more to reading and literacy, think about the myriad ways to incorporate books into a program: book talks; book trailers; talking about authors and illustrators and their styles and processes; facilitating a discussion where kids share what they've been reading. All are viable options for connecting programs to literacy in an engaging way.What you'll find when you start to unprogram--in addition to freeing yourself from worry about programs connecting to library goals--is that children who attend the programs show up because they are interested in books as well as the topic you've chosen for the program. Incorporating book elements into an otherwise activity-laden program only adds to their interest and engagement by highlighting a topic they care about. Unprogramming is taking kids seriously in a forum that is important to them.Tomorrow, Marge will share her official recipe for unprogramming."},

We had a number of requests to put our content online, and we will be doing so in installments over the course of this week. Chime in with your own unprogramming ideas and stories in the comments or on Twitter using the hashtag #unprogramming.~~*~~Programming. We all do it: planning what we'll do, gathering our materials, promoting the event to library families, and hosting the program on our specified day and time. Most of us got our chops planning story times for preschoolers. Preschool story time is a highly choreographed affair, with specifically-chosen stories, rhymes, and fingerplays that blend together to become more than the sum of their parts. Preschool programming also involves engaging caregivers in a way that influences them to facilitate their children's literacy development outside of the program room. Sure, preschool story time requires a degree of flexibility in content to account for the attention spans' of the audience; but that's flexibility with oodles of planned materials. Preschool programming takes a lot of planning.But what about school-age programming, the older cousin of preschool programming? What's going on there?Libraries have many various motivations for offering programming for their school-age customers:We want to draw people into our buildingsWe want to provide entertainmentWe want to highlight our library collectionsWe want to increase use and circulation of our materialsWe want to support literacy in every formWe want to allow children to try new things and develop their own interestsWe want to engage larger, more diverse audiences of community membersAs much as we may want to jump full into school-age programming, we as librarians acknowledge that programming pitfalls do exist:Program fatigue is a thing, and librarians can find themselves burnt out by offering too many high-intensity programsPlanning time takes over other dutiesMany programs cost money, and budgets may or may not support program costsYou never know just how many kids will participateKids who have attended past programs have appeared boredStaff aren't very interested or invested in offering interesting programming for school-agersAnd yet, despite these potential pitfalls, we continue to program for school-agers, as we should. But, *EUREKA!*, programming for school-age children does not need to be a time-consuming, exhaustively-planned affair fraught with worry and burnout. On the contrary, librarians can unprogram for school-age children.Tomorrow, Marge will share the concept of \"unprogramming\" and what it is."},

I left with many new ideas from colleagues across the country, and to me, that's the sign of a great program or conversation--I leave with concrete takeaways. The group discussion offered a number of terrific ideas and resources:Looking for a play-based program model with great STEM potential? Look to the MAP program--for Messy Active Play--at the Suffolk County Libraries on Long Island.Want to partner with organizations or get grand funding for STEM activities?

Attendees shared a number of titles and publishers:The Loopy Coop Hens: Letting Gotitles by Steven Jenkinstitles from Pebble Bookstitles from Peachtree PublishersSpotlight on Young Children guides from NAEYCWhat about options for passive STEM programming? Participants shared two stellar ideas that I hadn't thought to mention, although my library does them:STEM Observation Stations -- get an ant farm, worm farm, root farm, butterfly garden, terrarium, plant of some kind, carnation in colored water, etc., and let kids observe it and how it changes whenever they're in the libraryTake-Home Story Time Kits on STEM themes -- make it easy for caregivers to pick up a pre-bundled set of materials on a STEM topic; details on how my library does these kits hereMany discussion group attendees also raved about the previous day's program, \"What's Hot in STEAM Education: How Using ECRR2 Supports Literacy, Common Core and School Success.\" I was bummed to have to miss the program due to a meeting conflict, but I was happy to hear all program materials will be shared on the ECRR Ning.

{"title": null, "date": "Tuesday, July 2, 2013", "text": "In the lead-up to the 2013 ALA Annual Conference, you may have heard rumblings about Guerrilla Storytime. The pre-Chicago online chatter about the informal movement resulted in a great crowd of attendees in the Uncommons for the advertised Friday and Saturday storytimes. That stellar attendance (upwards of 75 folks dropped by and/or participated each of those days!) led Guerrilla Storytime idea-genius Cory Eckert to stage a completely impromptu edition on the Monday afternoon of the conference, too.But wait. I'm getting ahead of myself. Let's start at the beginning.Cory Eckert, the idea-genius I just mentioned, is the youth services manager at the Octavia Fellin Public Library in Gallup, New Mexico. Back in March, Eckert took to Twitter with an idea for storytime skills building and advocacy among the larger librarian population. Why not stage pop-up storytimes at a major library conference like ALA Annual? Such an event would allow youth services librarians to share their expertise and learn from their peers, and the fact that other non-YS librarians would be able to see the activity in the public space would foster awareness that storytime is so much more than just reading books to kids. Anna Haase Krueger of Future Librarian Superhero created a Google Group to allow interested librarians to continue the conversation in depth, and shortly after the term \"Guerrilla Storytime\" was chosen as the name for the project.Cut to last Friday in Chicago. At 3 p.m., a group of children's librarians entered the Uncommons as planned. Then more and more people started to join as Guerrilla Storytime got underway. The beginning premise was straightforward: participant volunteers would select a storytime challenge from the Challenge Cup, then respond to that challenge using their own knowledge or by asking the audience for assistance. Challenges were brainstormed by Eckert, Melissa Depper of the blog Mel's Desk (and 2013 Mover & Shaker!), and myself, and they included such topics as incorporating early literacy skills and practices into storytime, favorite and go-to rhymes and songs, and strategies for responding to storytime problems (moms talking in the back, we're talking about you).Guerrilla Storytime Challenge Cups can all look different.On Friday, Guerrilla Storytime started with a few brave souls getting the energy pumping. After the initial few challenge-seekers, more and more attendees opted to try their hands at storytime skills and share ideas with their colleagues.My favorite takeaways from Friday (a limited list, to be sure, because I couldn't type all the great ideas into my phone quickly enough!):What do you do when the moms in the back won't stop talking? Cate's strategy is to stop talking, or whatever activity she is doing at the front of the room. If the obvious pause in storytime doesn't stop the chatter, then Cate will start to make silly faces. Of course the kids notice, and of course they start to make silly faces back. Suddenly, in the unexpected quiet and barrage of goofy faces, offending talkers usually get the picture.Trying out some favorite parachute songs.Favorite parachute song? Kendra grabbed the parachute that Katie generously brought to the convention center, and a small army of storytime guerrillas jumped up to play along. Kendra's favorite song to share during parachute play time--especially with toddlers and younger preschoolers--is \"These Are the Colors Over You,\" a simple song about the colors on the parachute set to the tune of \"Twinkle Twinkle.\" As you can imagine, a singalong ensued.How do you incorporate letter knowledge into storytime? Instead of creating an entire storytime around a single letter, a storytime guerrilla says that she'll tell her kiddos their \"letter of the day;\" whenever the group might encounter that letter during storytime, everyone makes note of it together. We all know how much kids love seek-and-find activities, and this strategy emphasizes letter recognition without derailing your storytime theme.Your kids have the wiggles! What do you do? Rick got the whole group standing to participate in his go-to wiggles-be-gone trick: the chant \"Form the Orange.\" This one is solid gold.What do you do when your storytime crowd has grown too large, but your supervisor doesn't see that as a problem? A few voices chimed in here with some great ideas. One, have a discussion with said supervisor about the goals of storytime; this discussion can allow you to voice concerns about meeting specific goals in a too-crowded room. Second, invite said supervisor to storytime. Sometimes, it takes the visual of seeing kids unable to adequately participate due to group size to impress the notion that program size matters.Favorite cumulative stories? There Was a Tree, The Great Big Turnip, This is the Jacket I Wear in the Snow, and I Ain't Gonna Paint No More (for which Cate dons a painter's full-body smock and lets kids paint her!).Favorite shaker song? Mel got in front of the group to lead a rousing rendition of \"We're Going to Kentucky.\"How do you incorporate vocabulary into storytime? Katie shared her modification of \"The Itsy Bitsy Spider,\" which she uses to talk about size words and family words. Katie starts with the familiar Itsy Bitsy spider, who is then accompanied by his younger sister, Eensy Weensy, and his older brother, Big Giant spider.Mel has shared her takeaways from the Saturday Guerrilla Storytime on her blog.Guerrilla Storytime on the Front Porch StageThen, on Monday, after the exhibits hall had closed and not too many folks were left in the conference center, Cory Eckert called for an impromptu Guerrilla Storytime. A group of librarians, some of them youth services folks but many not, were gathered around the Front Porch Stage, a small stage front in the atrium of the convention center. Many new participants shared their expertise there, including some absolute gems that I cannot wait to incorporate back at my library:Favorite fingerplay? Marge shared a rendition of \"Five Little Monkeys Sitting in a Tree\" that uses sign language as the finger playing; when she shares the fingerplay in storytime, she always does the last verse (\"One little monkey...\") silently, everyone using just their hands. Then Julie shared her delightful \"Five Little Hotdogs\"--a bit of fun absurdity to add to storytime.Best books for incorporating narrative skills? Monkey & Me; Oh, No!; and Animal Masquerade were highly-recommended titles.Best practices for incorporating books with foreign words? Make laminated pictures of the unfamiliar words, then use the pictures as references whenever the word appears in the story. Before you know it, \"gato\" will so obviously mean \"cat\" to your storytime audience.Was Guerrilla Storytime successful? As a storytime provider who left with lots of new ideas, I would say so undoubtedly. What about from an advocacy perspective? After Friday's Guerrilla Storytime, an adult services public librarian came up to me in the Uncommons and said how much he enjoyed seeing all of the different things that can happen in the storytime room. After the Monday edition, Steve Thomas interviewed Eckert about the Guerrilla Storytime project for his library podcast, Circulating Ideas. Guerrilla Storytime appears to have begun to reach even a small group of non-YS librarians with information about what storytime really entails (and how knowledgeable, how expert, storytime librarians are).The best news: Guerrilla Storytime has every appearance of becoming a regular conference activity, albeit one that remains a bit off the grid. If you weren't able to take in Guerrilla Storytime in Chicago this past week, just look for Guerrilla Storytimes happening at future conferences like Midwinter, ALA Annual in Las Vegas, and perhaps even PLA and the ALSC Institute. In the meantime, share your favorite storytime skills and conference storytime takeaways on Twitter using #guerrillastorytime. There is so much we can learn from one another while advocating for the extremely important work that librarians do in storytime."},

{"title": null, "date": "Monday, June 24, 2013", "text": "I'm now four months into offering a monthly Saturday preschool program--Milk & Cookies Story Morning--here at my library. Attendance seems to be growing steadily, with each program pretty well split between new faces and return attendees. For my June program, I even had a teen volunteer in the room to help keep things running extra smoothly while the kids and I got silly. Once again, my four content goals for this story time program remained the same: interactivity, transmedia, folk/fairy tale sharing, and free play time. Here's what we did:Opening Song: \"Open, Shut Them\"Story: Shark in the Park! by Nick Sharratt     My colleague Angie introduced me to this book during my first month on the job, and I have loved it ever since. It's a brief, mostly-rhyming story of young Timothy Pope who, having just received a telescope, takes it to the park to look at things. What does he think he sees? A SHARK IN THE PARK! I like to encourage kiddos to use their own telescopes (hands in a telescope circle in front of one eye) as we read this clever book.Song: \"Grey Squirrel\"     The song cube indicated that we should sing \"Grey Squirrel,\" and sing it we did--complete with swishing our bushy tails.App: Safari Animals by Simms Taback, part of the Simms Taback Children's Book Collection app by CJ Educations     I turned off the sound and used the read to me function of this app, which let me move through the pages at a pace that allowed the children and me to interact with what we were reading/seeing. The premise of this story is basic: the viewer can only see part of an illustration of an animal, and the words on the screen give hints to its name. This story pacing gave us plenty of time to talk about what we know about safari animals (giraffes, hippos, ostriches, lions), and we had fun making sounds and moving our bodies like the animals would. I mentioned to attending caregivers that this is an example of using technology in an interactive and educational way.Song: \"Rock and Roll Freeze Dance\" by Hap Palmer     This short song introduces the idea of dancing until the music stops, at which point everyone is meant to freeze. It's a great, short, wiggles-reducing musical interlude.Story: \"Stone Soup\"     I put together a kit of props for telling the folk tale \"Stone Soup\" that includes a bowl, a spoon, a stone, and cut-out pictures of various types of vegetables. I passed out the vegetables and spoon to children in the room, and together we made soup as I told the story. Because of the younger age range of my attendees, we dumped a bunch of veggies in the soup pot at once--attention wasn't going to last much longer. I'd use this story again with a slightly older audience.Song: \"If You're Happy and You Know It\"     The kids insisted we roll the song cube again, and this song is what it landed on. Who am I to say \"no\" to a joyful request for a song?Song: \"Silly Dance Contest\" by Jim Gill     We finished the story time portion of our morning with this wonderful crazy-to-cool-down song. Try it if you're looking for a way to get kids moving without them turning totally bonkers at the end.Milk and Cookies Time!     Our menu included chocolate Teddy Grahams (much to everyone's delight) as well as 2% milk or water. These smaller cookies seem to have gone over the best of any of our cookies so far; I'll be sticking to the small bites concept in the future.Play Time!!     I rolled back the partition to the other side of our meeting room to reveal four play stations: a science station (magnets, magnifying glasses, balance scale); a cars and garages station (all wooden toys); a concepts station (writing, colors, puzzles, counting); and a building station, which featured my branch's early literacy play kit for the month, chunky blocks. Four families stayed for a full half hour of play after the snack, and I was excited to see how many caregivers got down on the sit-upons at the stations to interact and play with their own children and the kids who approached them. I also used this time to invite families to sign up for summer reading if they hadn't already. I got six new summer readers registered, which made me happy.~~*~~I love that this program has a very simple level of input from the caregiver--just come to the library!--with a huge potential for return. Early literacy story time, information on media literacy, relaxing time to enjoy a small snack, productive play time...even summer reading. That's a lot of bang for zero bucks."},

{"title": null, "date": "Monday, June 17, 2013", "text": "I talk a lot about going on outreach story time visits, but what happens when the day care crowd comes to visit the library? That's when I add elements to story time that we can't necessarily do in classrooms with varying space and equipment. Namely, I add in wonderfully interactive songs that we can get up and dance too--easy to do in the library program room's open space. I also wrap up visits with a tour as a means of inviting kids back to find their favorite types of books. Here's what I did with a few day care groups that stopped by my branch last week:Song: \"Open, Shut Them\"     The kiddos are familiar with this song because I sing it with them when I visit their child care centers. The familiarity of the song and motions gets them in the story time mindset.Story: Officer Buckle and Gloria by Peggy Rathmann     I love this story--it's great for preschool-aged children who are really getting into slightly longer stories. When I share Officer Buckle and Gloria, I point out the Caldecott Medal on the front cover. I explain what the award means, and I invite the children to pay extra close attention to the pictures as we share the story. Gloria's antics and Officer Buckle's obliviousness are always a hit.Song: Song Cube selection     I brought out my Song Cube for this story time visit, and a roll of the cube decided that we would sing \"If You're Happy and You Know It.\" Even though I usually sing this song with the kids at their child care centers, they never seem to tire of it.Story: The Three Little Pigs, illustrated by Emily Bolam     I love to share classic folk and fairy tales, and our minimally-decorated program room seems to be a perfect setting for doing so. There's nothing around the room to distract children from the book, so they pay great attention even when they are familiar with the story being told. After we read this story, there was lots of discussion about which pig the children would rather be.Song: \"Silly Dance Contest\" by Jim Gill     We have lots of space to get up and move in our program room at the library, which means playing great movement songs on our CD player is a go-to choice for special story time visits. This \"Silly Dance Contest\" is a marvelous song that is easy for children to follow, and they have a good time getting some energy out in the middle of story time.Story: Monkey's Friends by Ruth Brown     I introduce this story by saying the children need to help me with two things: 1) the names of animals, and 2) rhymes. As Monkey moves through the jungle, he finds and greets a number of friends in the lushly-illustrated, lift-the-flap pages of this book. It's a short read, but definitely enjoyable.Brief Tour of the Children's Area     I finish all day care visits to the library with a brief guided tour of the library. I usually point out three things: 1) Picture Book City, where kids can come to find the types of books they like to read; 2) the awards section, where kids can find more Caldecott books as well as state award nominees; and 3) the check-out desk, where I mention the whole library-card-borrow-books-for-free setup. Our check-out desk is at the front of the branch, so ending tours there allows for a fluid, calm exit from the library for visiting groups.I'm always thrilled to hear after a visit how many kids say they'll come back to see me with mom or dad. I consider these types of visits a perfect time to make the library a comfortable, inviting place for children.What do you do when child care centers visit your library?"},

Last month, the kids helped create the memory game cards for our summer reading kick-off event. This month, our service project focused on readers' advisory--namely, kids making book recommendations for their peers.The idea for these Read Me! Blurb Bubbles came from a picture on a post on the RIF Blog earlier this year. I loved the idea of having brief descriptors hanging off of books on the shelves, catching browsers' attention and giving them a nudge toward great reads.I modified the concept for our KAB. Using Publisher, I created a one-page template that, when folded, results in a two-sided blurb bubble. Each bubble is printed with the words \"Read me! I'm [...] This recommendation is brought to you by the Kids Advisory Board.\" KAB members filled in the blank portion of the blurb bubbles with a word (or two) describing their favorite reads, then we attached the blurbs on the respective books. Some of the blurbed books in this first go-round include Clementine (\"funny\"), Bridge to Terabithia (\"fascinating\"), and The Graveyard Book (\"spooky\").My hope is that these blurb bubbles will do two things: a) encourage young readers to try a book recommended by their peers, and b) pique curiosity about the Kids Advisory Board, which is still in its early stages. I'd love to have more regular KAB members, and I'd love to have more kids involved in making the stacks more exciting to browse.Do you get kids involved in passive readers' advisory? What are you strategies for facilitating peer recommendations?"},

I shared this title earlier this week in Bouncing Babies, and everyone got really into the book. It can be terrifically interactive for little ones, as it invites listeners to wave to the babies on parade. If there's one motor skill babies and toddlers seem to master early on, it's waving.

{"title": null, "date": "Monday, June 10, 2013", "text": "I've learned that a key word for summer story times is \"flexibility.\" Attention span, energy level, tolerance for stories--I've found that all these things can be completely up in the air when the sun is bright and the weather hot. So I pack my story time bag with options in mind.During a daycare visit last week, I was reminded of the importance of simplicity, too. You see, while I had packed a specific story time plan with a variety of books and some other accoutrements, I immediately picked up on the vibe of my audience. These kids were feeling restless, easily distracted. It was time to just respond to them.In terms of books, that meant sharing straightforward, interactive favorites. Think Don't Let the Pigeon Drive the Bus!, Go Away, Big Green Monster, and Can You Make a Scary Face? All three are great stories that allow kiddos to get involved in the action and response. Simplicity.Being flexible also meant that, when a train could be heard approaching, we paused our story. These kids can see the train tracks from their story time room, and they immediately ran to the window when they heard that train whistle. So we talked about trains for a few minutes until the train was gone and the kids were ready to sit back down. Flexibility.I had brought my orangutan puppet in my story time bag. In lieu of a more formal rhyme, I made one up on the spot that would allow us to do fun and silly primate actions: I'm an orangutan, hairy and brown / Let's *action here* and monkey around! The kids had fun suggesting actions--some realistic to orangutans, some not--and we chanted many verses of the short rhyme. Simplicity.For the musical portions of our story time, I had my ukulele. We sang one of the kids' favorites, \"I Like to Eat Apples and Bananas.\" Then, instead of moving on to another story, they asked me to play more songs. They suggested songs (\"Itsy Bitsy Spider,\" \"Twinkle, Twinkle,\" and the like), I played them, and we all sang and danced. Flexibility.That's how we passed our 30 minutes of story time: simply and with flexibility of program content. I could have forced my formal story time plan, of course--and been met with whining, distracted hitting, and overall mayhem. Instead, we collaborated on an enjoyable, early literacy-positive story time adventure. Flexible and simple. And valuable."},
{"title": null, "date": "Friday, June 7, 2013", "text": "Many a public librarian has struggled with the topic of how to get kids from the local schools to participate in summer reading. We visit for summer reading rallies, hoping that our enthusiastic encouragements will inspire them to show up during the summer. Sometimes, however, that's not enough. Once kids are out of school, with no teacher or librarian to remind them to visit the public library, the whole premise of the public library's summer reading program can fall through the cracks.To try to get more local students involved in summer reading, a few of the local schools are working with us this year on some new promotional strategies:Principals are emphasizing to caregivers that student participation in the public library's summer reading program is strongly encouraged. A few local elementary schools sent home letters with this message, and they were signed by the principal. Several schools have planned rewards for students who bring their public library SRP logs back to school in the fall. And at least one local school is using their robo-calling service (typically used for delays and snow days) to remind all families to visit the public library. In return, we collect names and schools of all children who finish our program. We report these successful students' names to their schools in the fall.Reminders about the public library SRP will be handed out at open school library days this summer. A handful of elementary schools in our district are open to students one day each in June and July. One of the school librarians specifically asked me to create a simple flyer (pictured above) that she can give to attendees to remind them about our program. I included the addresses for the two nearest branch libraries, as many of these families haven't visited the public library before.School librarians have arranged to meet their students in our public library meeting room. This promotional strategy had a few hiccups in its initial occurence; we had booked the meeting room for the school librarians, but we didn't know ahead of time to arrange to have a staff member in the room with them to help with SRP sign-ups. After a bit of shuffling, our staff set up a makeshift SRP sign-up station in the meeting room to help the 75+ families that stopped in. The school librarians had advertised that students who met them at the public library and signed up for our SRP would get bonus incentives at their school.Those are the three new strategies we're trying this summer with our local school district to encourage their students' participation in our SRP. I'm hoping both our sign-up and completion statistics see a jump because of these efforts. At any rate, if we can bring in even just a handful of new families to the library's SRP this summer, I'll count us successful.Do you take any intentional steps to get more students involved in your summer reading program?"},
{"title": null, "date": "Wednesday, June 5, 2013", "text": "The beginning of summer reading is a pretty big deal. We emphasize the start date when we visit schools, and all the library signage and promotional materials clearly display the date on which families can start getting involved. As a result, we tend to get a TON of people who visit our branches on Summer Reading Day 1 because they're excited to start at the very first chance.What better reason to have a Summer Reading Kick-Off Party? Lots of libraries do it. The people are going to be there--why not make it as much fun and as big a deal as possible?That's precisely what we did earlier this week. Our big Summer Reading Kick-Off Party took place at a local county park--the same site as another fun program we've got going on this summer--on Monday afternoon. We had lots for kids and families to do during their visits. Starting at 3 p.m., we had a ribbon-cutting ceremony to formally open our library/parks partnership installation. That ribbon-cutting was complete with crazy-large scissors and a young frequent library program-goer doing the honors of snipping the ribbon. Lots of families took that opportunity to make the walk around the lake trail and read Peter Brown's The Curious Garden. I love the comparison photo (below) that shows just how lush this park has become compared to when our partnership was in its earliest stages.Many more festivities took place in the adjacent park lodge (we wanted shelter in case of inclement weather, of which there was none). Our local Sam's Club donated a cake for the event, and families enjoyed light refreshments and water. We also had an army of teen volunteers helping out at the 6 activity stations spread out in the lodge:Flower Craft -- Kids made flowers out of cupcake liners and pipe cleaners.Tree Cookie Necklace Craft -- Kids could decorate \"tree cookies\" made from slices of cedar trees and string them into necklaces. Cedar is invasive in this region, and while the park department needs to remove it from the parks, they save every bit they cut down and use it somehow.Summer Reading Tattoos and Stickers -- Kids love to wear reading tattoos and stickers. We don't mind the free promotion.The Curious Garden Memory Game -- The members of my library's Kids Advisory Board helped put together this big game of Memory (you may have grown up calling it Concentration). Kids had fun playing against one another and themselves.Dig into Science -- A dozen specimens from the lake trail--leaves, flowers, grasses--were available for closer inspection with the help of our magnifying glasses.Meet a St. Louis Lion -- This local soccer team is a summer reading prize sponsor--children and teen readers can earn free tickets to the games--so we were happy when they asked if they could be part of the Kick-Off Party. They talked to very excited kids and signed pictures.We also had two informational booths: one from the library, where kids, teens, and adults could all sign up for their respective summer reading programs as well as pick up summer event guides; and one from the parks department, where folks could get more information about goings-on at other county parks. We saw very brisk business at the summer reading signup table, with lots of families eager to get started reading together. Everyone couldn't help but smile when we reminded them that reading the book around the lake trail would count toward their reading goals!Jamming with WildHeartThe last formal event we had at our Kick-Off Party was a concert from children's educators and entertainers WildHeart. This Emmy-winning duo shared 45 minutes of fun, silly, informational, and interactive songs for the families in the lodge. I saw lots of kids getting into dancing like amphibians and other creatures.After the concert, families finished up visiting the activity stations and the summer reading sign-up table. The crowd started to dissipate as we neared dinnertime, which provided a perfect opportunity for volunteers to get themselves signed up for summer reading.The final count of attendees at the Kick-Off Party was 493--a truly incredible success considering we've never offered an off-site event like this before. Our parks department partners were really thrilled with the event as well.The weather was gorgeous--a sunny 68 degrees, occasional clouds. The mood was bright and cheery. And the customers (all ages!) were enthusiastically enjoying themselves. I heard from many, many patrons who were very pleased with the event and expressed a hope that we'll do something similar in future years.I'm having a hard time thinking why we wouldn't."},
{"title": null, "date": "Monday, June 3, 2013", "text": "Picture Book Walk at Quail Ridge ParkWith all the hullabaloo that is summer reading, it can be easy for youth librarians to forget about anything else that happens in the summer months. The sun is shining! The weather is warm! It's a perfect time to wander about outside!Translation: It's a perfect time for a Picture Book Walk.Around this time last year, Angela Reynolds shared her Nova Scotia library's StoryWalk™ on the ALSC Blog. The whole idea, I later learned, actually traces back to Anne Ferguson from Montpelier, VT, who came up with the first StoryWalk® in 2007. Since then, Anne has created a slew of resources for libraries with all sorts of funding situations to offer similar installations. The basic premise of a StoryWalk® immediately struck me as wonderfully boundary-breaking: a library/parks joint effort to give the community an opportunity to move and read outside. Brilliant! And so I started getting things in order to be able to offer a similar program in my community.Today, June 3, is the official start date of our Picture Book Walk at Quail Ridge Park. We have opted to call our installation a Picture Book Walk because we are focusing specifically on the picture book as a visual and literary art form; we want people to engage with the entire book. All summer long, we're featuring Peter Brown's The Curious Garden--a book that seemed perfect to be read and enjoyed in a natural setting--on rustic handmade cedar signs at a county park near my branch. Brown's beautiful story and illustrations are featured in 17 signs, enough for an introductory sign in addition to the 16 full-page spreads of the book. The signs are spread along a 0.75-mile long paved trail; it's fully accessible to wheelchairs, strollers, and walkers of every age. A person who walks the trail will be able to read the entire book surrounded by bright green foliage. The whole experience, minus any extra time for contemplating the beauty of nature, takes about 20 minutes. A reasonable and restful interlude for a summer's day.There are many reasons I love this project. Let me name a few:A particularly picturesque viewIt promotes literacy and wellness for families in the community. Sharing a story and a stroll can feel luxurious, but it is simply healthful for mind and body.It allows the library to engage with a larger community than just those folks who already visit our branch. By offering a fun, family-friendly, and aesthetically lovely activity outside of the library, we're demonstrating that the library is truly a community treasure. We value the people we serve, whether we serve them directly or have yet to see them in a branch. We want their lives to be rich and interesting.We now have a partnership with our county parks department. This Picture Book Walk has truly been a joint effort, with the library and the parks department sharing ideas and tasks. The library procured permission from Little, Brown and Peter Brown to use the book; secured funding for the purchase of the sign post materials; and prepared the book pages for mounting. The parks department provided the location for the 3-month-long event; built the sign posts; and got the word out to media outlets across the metro St. Louis area. We both put in time and resources for a big ribboncutting and kick-off event (more details on that in a future post). As a result, we now have a working partnership. We know how to work together to get things done. The potential in this new relationship is vast.Summer reading has a new dimension. When reluctant readers complain about not knowing what they should read for summer reading, we can tell them about the Picture Book Walk at Quail Ridge Park. Enjoying the walk once counts as one step closer to meeting the summer reading goal for any age child. When the library is particularly busy and crammed full of people, we can offer the walk as an alternative for spending some time engaged in reading. It's an ultimate passive program.It's just beautiful. Really, isn't that sometimes sufficient?I am thrilled to be able to offer the people in our community the chance to engage in reading and nature with the first ever Picture Book Walk in Quail Ridge Park. If you find yourself anywhere near the St. Louis area between now and the end of August, please stop by.~~*~~Curious for more details on how we got the walk up and running in the logistical sense? Here are some tidbits on what we did. Feel free to contact me if you'd like more specifics.Laminating the picture book spreadsI contacted Peter Brown and Little, Brown before Christmas to get initial approval to use The Curious Garden. Technically, if the library owns the book and the picture book walk is free, formal permission isn't necessary. I think it's always better to have it, though.The picture book pages that are mounted in the signs are physical pages from print copies of The Curious Garden. To get them walk-ready, I first took apart the binding and individual pages with the help of a colleague. Next I matched up the appropriate pages to maintain the order of the book; I attached them using book tape. I affixed the pages to matting with a walk footer on it (designed by my library district's graphic designer); this strip at the bottom of each spread includes logos for the library district, parks department, and library foundation, who funded the signs. Finally, I laminated the spreads to keep them weatherproof.The cedar sign posts are sturdily fixed in the ground. The display portion is painted plywood with a plexiglass cover. Weather stripping seals the top and sides of the display portion, leaving the bottom open so moisture can escape.The first and last signs, with the title page and final wordless two-page spread respectively, also feature some text from us, the organizers. An introductory statement explains the walk, and a closing paragraph encourages continued enjoyment of books and nature.~~*~~Has your library offered a similar event? What stories have been most successful?"},

Volunteers have been trained and scheduled. Early Literacy Calendars have been updated and printed. Summer Seek and Find characters have been assembled for their passive program duties. Materials have been organized. The last thing remaining for me to do is to really beef up our ready reference book lists for kids.As is the case at many libraries, I work a shared reference desk. As a result, about 50% of the time the children's staffers are assisting with adult questions and adult staffers are assisting with children's questions. Not all staff read children's books, so I like to have ready-to-go resource lists to make sure kids get great reading suggestions regardless of when they visit.This summer, my clipboard of resources includes a few key lists:ALSC's Summer Reading Lists for grades K-2, 3-5, and 6-8A great YA \"If you liked...\" visual list from Kelly at Stacked BooksLeveled reading book lists in the Fountas & Pinnell system (created by a local organization)A readalike map for \"If you like Diary of a Wimpy Kid\" as shown hereWe also have state award nominee bookmarks at the reference desk, and we have Caldecott and Newbery lists within easy reach. My teen services staffer has also put together a binder with all our local schools' summer reading lists. All of these combined resources mean that reference staff have lists of great kid-friendly reads--and the books teens will be searching out for school--at their fingertips. Everything can be photocopied, and everyone can leave the library happy and with something to read. That's one of the best ways I can think of to promote a successful summer reading program.What sorts of resources and book lists do you have ready to go at your reference desk?"},
{"title": null, "date": "Tuesday, May 28, 2013", "text": "Over the weekend, I led my third ever Milk & Cookies Story Morning family story time program. For more specific details of my rationale in offering this new weekend program, you can see my first two posts on the topic. Suffice it to say that my personal must-haves in the program remained the same: transmedia, interactivity, a folk/fairy tale, and time for free play--this time including some simple science activities.The program went really well, and a good crowd attended despite it being a holiday weekend. Here's what we did:Opening Song: \"Open, Shut Them\"Story: Up, Down, and Around by Katherine Ayres     I prefaced this story by saying it was about growing all sorts of vegetables, and I asked the kids what vegetables they knew. Throughout the story, we would point out the vegetables we like. The last page shows a feast of foods created with the veggies, and we had a fun time naming all the dishes.Song: \"Five Little Ducks\"     A roll of the song cube dictated that we would be singing \"Five Little Ducks,\" so I pulled out five little rubber duckies as a visual counting aid. During the first verse of the song, I was pretty much the only one in the room singing and making the mamma duck's big \"QUACK! QUACK! QUACK!\" By the final verse, though, everyone was joyfully singing with me. A wonderful benefit of repetitive counting songs and rhymes: kids catch on and gain confidence as they go.App: Peek-a-Zoo: Toddler Peekabo at the Zoo by treebetty     To use this app in an interactive way in the program, I turned off narration and background music--all noise except the animal noises. I cued the app to the first \"page,\" which shows a lion crouching in some grass. When it was time for the app, I turned on our tv and we took a walk through a zoo. Each animal has a two-stage process: one where you can try to guess the animal by what you see on the screen, and the second when the animal appears in full and you hear the sound it makes (the second page also shows the name of the animal written out, so one could talk about letters, too). I asked lots of questions to help kids guess the animal they might see next, and we used clues from what we could see in the animal's environment to help us figure it out. One of the things I love about this app is that the animals are not just your stock zoo animals--it includes a number of lesser-shown ones, like walruses, too. I engaged caregivers in a brief tidbit about the difference between using technology with children passively--e.g., sitting them in front of a tv or device unattended--and actively--i.e., engaging in the technology with them.     As the picture shows, my iPad setup includes using a Digital AV Adapter and HDMI cable. I operate the app from the iPad, which is mirrored onto the HDTV screen.Song: \"I Know a Chicken\" by Laurie Berkner     I love this song and use it all the time. It's a perfect length for keeping kids interested, and when I pass out the egg shakers, everyone's excitement levels go up a bit. That makes for a great interactive program element.Story: The Three Billy Goats Gruff by Paul Galdone     Only one or two kids in the program were already familiar with this story, so I was very glad I selected it for our story time. It's a great one for getting kids involved in trip, trapping across the bridge, and it also allows the use of some great silly voices for the billy goats and troll.Activity: Rhythmic Play with Scarves     I handed out multi-colored scarves to all of the children, and once they had stood up we began waving our scarves. I put on \"Dancing Scarf Blues\" by Carole Peterson, and we had some fun waving our scarves around to the music.Milk & Cookies Time!     This weekend's selection included chocolate chip cookies and 2% milk or pink lemonade. There was at least one dad who looked like he wanted a cookie, too, but when his wife opted not to have one, he did the same. The kiddos loved it, though.Free PlayOur science table     As with previous weeks, I set out little play stations with lots of the library's stock of early learning toys. We had building blocks and pipe builders, build-a-monsters and wooden cars with garages. New this time were some magnetic writing boards--always great to work some writing in!--and a repurposed train table frame that I turned into a science station. I set out magnifying glasses with seashells, a starfish, and feathers to explore up close; magnet wands with a variety of sizes of paper clips, washers, and jingle bells; and a balance scale with random objects to play with weight. Every child went to the science table for at least a few minutes, which made it the hit of the free play time. All the stations get pretty well explored and the toys played with--nothing like some free time to interact with the world as you please.~~*~~An aside: I am starting to realize that, if this program's attendance keeps growing and I still really want to focus on the free play (which requires space), I may have to adapt the milk & cookies portion of the program. My program room isn't big enough for a larger crowd to have space to sit down and move around in story time, sit at tables for the snack, and also have toys set out with room to play. I'm going to think about options like lunchbox-size cookie snack bags and juice boxes or milk cartons--things that can be enjoyed, picnic-style, without big tables and chairs and without to much threat of spills. Anyone have any ideas?"},
{"title": null, "date": "Friday, May 24, 2013", "text": "Summer reading is afoot, which means I've spent some time over the last few weeks visiting local elementary schools to whip up excitement for our annual summer reading program. This is my second year making these specialized school visits, and I've learned a few things along the way.There are a handful of core things I always make sure to include in these summer reading rallies, which usually include a simple slideshow:An image of my library -- Many kids don't know the name of the library they go to, but they recognize the building when they see it. Including a picture of my branch at the beginning of the rally helps kids make a personal connection with what I'm talking about.A verbal listing of all the potential prizes for signing up and reading -- It can be hard for elementary-aged children to remember specifics about what prizes they could earn, but when I rattle off a rather impressive (if I do say so) list of lots of prizes, they are left with the impression that summer reading is very, very rewarding. My library district has a lot of local sports teams and restaurants that partner to provide vouchers and coupons, so lots of those prizes I get to tout don't cost the library anything but printing.A slide with the next school year's age-appropriate book award nominees -- Schools in my area are really big on state book awards, and teachers regularly motivate their kids to read as many nominees as they can during the school year. That means more and more kids get ambitious and want to start reading award books \"early.\" I've found that sharing some covers and very brief book talks of nominees is a surefire way to ignite interest in reading over the summer.A reminder that audiobooks count for summer reading -- Lots of kids spend lots of time in the car over the summer; I like to remind them that they can listen to audiobooks from the library whenever they're in the car, and that time counts toward their final reading goal. Knowing that they can get some reading done via audiobook makes the program seem much more manageable to many kids.Names of the kids who did the summer reading program last year -- My library district keeps track of the names and schools of kids who finish the program, and we report this info to the schools at the end of the summer. I hold onto the list to add a slide with the kids' names to my rallies, and I make sure to acknowledge their achievement and ask for their classmates' help in applauding them. Nothing like a bit of positive peer pressure and motivation through recognition.I've found that these rally elements can do the most to drum up excitement and keep kids' attention.Also, in the course of visiting schools for these summer reading rallies, I have noticed that the time I am formally alloted to speak and the time I actually have can be very different. There are two common scenarios for timing issues: 1) I'm told I'll have x amount of time, but then I end up speaking after the kids get seated, the principal talks, and the school librarian talks, which has essentially cut my time in half; and 2) I'm told I'll have x amount of time but then five (or even ten) more minutes get tacked on to better fit schedules.When my time is suddenly shorter than I'd anticipated, I work really hard to just hit the basics. What's going to get the kids to pester their parents into driving them to the library? I only include that info, and I leave the details for when they come to the library to sign up.When my time has unexpectedly expanded, I tell a story. Yes, I've become one of those librarians who always has a couple of stories in her back pocket, ready for any of those 3-10 minute lulls in the planned action. This past week, when teachers insisted they needed to stay in the assembly for another 5 minutes (reason still unknown to me), I told \"The Old Woman Who Lived in a Vinegar Bottle.\" What could have been a chaotic 5 minutes with kindergarteners at the end of their ropes was instead a quiet room of kindergarteners rapt with attention. Crisis averted, literacy and stories affirmed.I enjoy visiting elementary schools in the lead-up to summer reading. It helps me get all the details of our massive program straightened out, it's a way to introduce myself to tons of kids, and it promotes our program and the idea of leisure reading. It's a very specific type of outreach with very definite rewards.Do you visit local schools to promote summer reading? How do you get the word out?"},
{"title": null, "date": "Wednesday, May 22, 2013", "text": "This week, a battle took place at my library. In the program room, to be exact. Don't worry, the battleground was prepped and the skirmish was intentional. It was all a part of my school-age STEAM program, Attack on the Fort!Our simple, unprogrammed program, which lasted an hour, consisted of four stages:I told the story of the Trojan War. As a preface to the topic of attacking a fort, I told an abbreviated version of the Trojan War myth. I started with the goddess beauty contest judged by the Trojan prince Paris; told of the theft of Helen from Menelaus and the sailing of 1000 Greek ships for Troy; and the 10-year stalemate that finally ended in favor of the Greeks thanks to the strategic genius of the Trojan Horse. In favor of keeping the kids' attention, I just hit the highlights and focused on the culminating action.We built catapults. The basic catapult construction requires 10 popsicle sticks, 4 or 5 rubber bands, a bottle cap (or other shallow cylinder), and something to affix the cap to the arm (we used velcro dots). Assembly instructions here. I demonstrated each step of the process with my own catapult, and I walked the room helping as requested.The kids built forts. I had plenty of large sheets of construction paper, straws, popsicle sticks, tape, markers, and scissors to allow for creativity in the fort engineering process. Once again, I was flabbergasted by the ingenuity of the kiddos. Some made turrets, some made walls, some made total fortresses.We had a battle. I had the children set their forts on the ground in a round; that way the battlefield was in the center of the forts, and all outward-shooting catapults would be sure to hit something. I handed out pom-pom balls as ammunition, then told the kids to prepare their catapults. I counted down for the opening shots, and from there it was total thrilling, soft, puffy war. The battle went on for a good 15 minutes, with little appearance of fatigue from any of the children.After the program, the children were able to take home their catapults, a few pieces of ammunition, and their forts, which was obviously very exciting--the kids always love to take home their creations. I had lots of positive, enthusiastic comments from both children and caregivers who attended; they loved the simplicity and freedom of the program, and they loved the chance to get to make something that was \"so cool.\" Attack on the Fort! was definitely that: simple, minimally-structured, and cool.STEAM and unprogramming, two of my favorite ways to think about children's programs."},

{"title": null, "date": "Monday, May 20, 2013", "text": "May is the last month of the school year when I visit preschools, which means it's my month to encourage kids to visit me at the library over the summer. I try and choose fun, funny, engaging stories to go out with a bang and make story time extra memorable. Here's what I've been taking to classrooms this month:Opening Song: \"Open, Shut Them\"Story: Scary Mary by Paula Bowles     I used this story to great success at my April Milk & Cookies Story Morning, and I gave it an encore performance with this new audience. They enjoyed it, and they also thoughtfully gave comments on why it is better to be nice to others than to be mean or scary.Story: I Don't Like Gloria! by Kaye Umansky and Margaret Chamberlain     A colleague recommended this story as a great read-aloud last month, and I am happy to report that she was correct--my kiddos really enjoyed this story. Calvin, a dog, is dismayed to find that Gloria, a cat, is now living at his house, and his attention from his owners has dwindled. Of course he blames Gloria; until another animal is added to the mix, that is. We talked about why being friendly might be better than growling or being mad at a new pet/friend; this book would also work well for children with new siblings.Rhyme: \"The Grand Old Duke of York\"     We did this rhyme as a stretch rhyme, clapping our laps to march and then raising/lowering our hands as the rhyme dictates. Much to the children's delight, we tried to do the rhyme faster and faster until finally all we could do was move our hands. Lots of giggles ensued.Story: There's a Nightmare in My Closet by Mercer Mayer     This book and its counterparts by Mayer are classics for a reason: perfect pacing, safe exploration of children's fears, and humor mixed in. These books never fail to quiet the entire room of children as anticipation mounts.Rhyme: \"Five Little Monkeys Swinging in a Tree\"     I think I would have riots on my hands if I didn't finish off the outreach year with my five monkey finger puppets and Al, my alligator puppet. Have you ever asked children to practice their alligator chomping noises? They are impressive.Story: Dragons Love Tacos by Adam Rubin     I hadn't originally planned on using this story this month, but when it showed up on my desk the morning of my first May outreach visit, I knew I had to work it in. This title is slightly longer than the others, but it holds high potential for absurdity and hilarity. I don't want to spoil it for you--check it out at your earliest opportunity. Suffice it to say that this was a perfect story to end with.Closing Song: \"If You're Happy and You Know It\"     Normally, I use \"If you're happy and you know it, wave goodbye\" as the closing verse for this song when I am indoors in classrooms. On the last story time visit of the school year, though, I'm willing to get noisy and default to the traditional \"shout 'hooray!'\" Oh, yes, it gets loud, especially on the last line when children really give it their all. If that last moment of fun is how they remember the year in story time? Well, then I think I've done my job."},

Don't forget to check out the rest of the posts from some fabulous youth services bloggers; links are in my opening post. And now, without further ado, I'll share how I'm using Start with a Book and its resources now.I blogged last year about my Take-Home Story Time Kits, neat little bundles of stories and music for caregivers to engage in story time at home. Caregivers (and other librarians!) love them, and guess what? Start with a Book, with their 24 Summer Learning Themes (many of which contain great STEAM tie-ins), offers some great resources for a new twist on those bundles.Right now in my library, I've got two types of bundles: Take-Home Story Time Kits for pre-readers, and Read and Do Bundles for readers (elementary-aged children). Almost everything about these bundles (save my tags, the music CDs, and the ribbon to tie them) comes from the resources on the Start with a Book 24 Summer Learning Themes. Here's what the bundles include:Take-Home Story Time Kits - for pre-readers2-3 books from the 3-6 year-old age level section of a SWAB themea children's music CD from my library's list of favorites (e.g., Laurie Berkner, They Might Be Giants)a Growing Readers activity sheet that pairs with the theme -- SWAB theme pages include these links in section 2 - Growing Readers: Parent Tipsa Start with a Book flyer -- so caregivers who enjoy the bundles have a pathway to finding more theme-extending activities, websites, and appsan eye-catching tag that does three things: 1) connects to summer reading (\"Dig into...\"); 2) advertises the kit's theme; and 3) gives a brief explanation of the kit and how to use itRead and Do Bundles - for readers1 book from the 9-12 year-old age level section of a SWAB themeprinted instructions for a theme-related activity -- SWAB theme pages include these links in section 2 - Hands-on Activities and Craftsa Start with a Book flyer -- so readers and their caregivers have access to more activities, including the SWAB theme recommendations of Great Websites for Kids and Mobile Appsan eye-catching tag that does three things: 1) connects to summer reading (\"Dig into...\"); 2) advertises the bundle's theme; and 3) invites the reader to read and do an activity on the topicOne of the things I love love love about the Start with a Book themes--and the bundles I can create with them--are the great STEAM options. There's STEAM at a basic level: the book lists include lots of great non-fiction titles. There's also the fact that so many of the themes, even the less obviously STEAM ones, have science tie-ins. Think dinosaurs and activities involving paleontology; explorers and related navigation and astronomy sciences; nature and books, activities, sites, and apps that explore life sciences. I love any opportunity to get families involved in STEAM concepts at home, and the resources in each of the 24 Summer Learning Themes certainly encourage that. As a result, my bundles encourage STEAM learning, too.These bundles initially took a bit of time to assemble; I needed to find the books from the SWAB theme lists, then choose and print the appropriate activity sheets and print tags. Once I had done the groundwork for the bundles, however, I made extra copies of the resources so that replenishing bundles as they check out is easy peasy (see my 2012 post for the check-out logistics of bundles).There you have it--that's how I thought to use the resources on the Start with a Book website immediately after checking it out. Thanks to this blog tour and its bloggers, however, I now see so many other avenues for using the site. I hope you do, too, and I hope you'll consider Start with a Book as a resource to support you in your summer library services.

{"title": null, "date": "Friday, May 10, 2013", "text": "The remnants of our Skittles experiment.About a month ago, a local elementary school special education teacher called me to find out about my branch's preschool science programs. She explained that her classroom includes the school's most developmentally disabled students, and she had hopes that the preschool science content would be fun and conceptually appropriate for her kids. The only problem, she said, was securing permission and transportation to take the class on a field trip to the library for the program. I never want access to be a limiting factor to what children can benefit from the library, so I offered to bring a program to her classroom.For this first special needs STEM outreach program, I modified the Color Science program I offered at the library over the winter. Full details of the original program are on the ALSC Blog, so I'll mostly discuss modifications here:We shared the story White Rabbit's Color Book, then we talked about colors by retelling the story with the help of popsicle stick puppets. Whereas with the preschoolers I had kept hold of the puppets, with this special needs classroom I passed out the puppets to any child interested in holding on to one. Thus I got to engage with each child, and we \"retold\" the story together. Also, each time we mentioned a color, we looked around the room to see who was wearing that color. Such a simple, effective addition to the program.We used a CD and flashlight to make rainbows. I took advantage of our small, cozy setup and took the CD and flashlight to each child, projecting a rainbow onto their hands, trays, or other light-colored surface that was within their immediate sight. A teacher turned off the overhead lights, and the children loved to see the bright, beautiful colors up close.We did the explosions of color activity with baking soda and vinegar dyed the primary colors. Together we observed what happens when primary colors mix. While some of the kids got involved in guessing what secondary colors would be made--their communication iPads had options for saying colors--all of them paid very close attention to the miniature fizz eruptions. We took turns looking at the color eruptions up close, with the aides carrying the plates to children in wheelchairs.We did the Skittles experiment, placing Skittles in water to see the colors come off and blend. I passed around observation sheets while the teacher and aides set out crayons, and nearly all of the children got to work drawing what their bowls of de-colored Skittles looked like. For the children with limited motor functions, I helped conduct the experiment on their chair trays and talked about the things we could see.I modified the text on my take-home activity sheets, which the teacher was excited to send home with the kids, to inform caregivers that they are always welcome to come to the library to find more stories and activities to share with their children. I wanted to extend that friendly hand to parents who may not consider the library a place for their families.That's how I did the STEM program for a special education classroom at one of my local elementary schools. What you might now be asking yourself is \"Why? Why take the time to modify a program and take outreach to an elementary classroom when our outreach is traditionally to preschools and day cares?\" Good question.The way I see it, there are a plethora of great reasons to modify a STEM program--or, really, any program--for special needs outreach. I'll share a few:Teachers feel supported. Special education teachers and aides work ridiculously hard; they spend so much time and energy focused on making the school experience as beneficial and comfortable as possible for their students. Anything the library can do to support them, to share some new classroom content that enriches the classroom experience, is a good thing. And having teachers know that the library supports their work? Priceless.Children feel valued. Face it, libraries don't traditionally meet the needs of special needs children particularly well in our usual program and service formats. Even sensory story times and inclusive programming tend to focus on the high-functioning end of the special needs spectrum, thereby excluding lots of kids from some outstanding library services. Reaching out to this under-served population demonstrates that the library truly values and serves all members of the community.The school and library develop a partnership. Special education is often overlooked when outsiders consider schools. By adding this classroom STEM initiative to our collaboration with the elementary school, we show that we are committed to building positive relationships between children and the library in every way possible. That means something to administrators who need to weigh the value of partnerships that may cost class time and staff.It's fun. The kids enjoy new activities, the teachers enjoy a half hour with someone else at the helm while their kids have fun, and the librarian has a great time, too. When a program or service is a win for everyone involved, it's hard to say no.~~*~~Have you modified any of your programs, or creating programs, for special needs children? Ever visit special education classrooms for outreach?"},
{"title": null, "date": "Wednesday, May 8, 2013", "text": "I can't help it--I never completely stop thinking about libraries. I think it's like how your brain will continue working on a problem or complication even while you're doing something else, like cooking or showering or sleeping. When my brain recognizes something with library potential, no matter what I'm doing, it's like a light goes off. Eureka! An idea from an unexpected place.Such was the case over the past week, when I was vacationing in New York City. That is a big city, full of lots of new sensory experiences; sometimes I just quietly take everything in, walking and observing without particular direction or intent. But then, out of seemingly nowhere, BAM! A library connection is made. As an example: I went wandering through the Met a bit, and I found myself in the hall of armor. There happened to be a family art activity going on; the activity encouraged museum-goers to sketch some of the patterns they saw in the armor and then etch their own patterns in art-quality foil. Says my brain: replicate this activity, and throw in some knights-in-shining-armor storytelling to make it a full, robust program. Easy peasy.I hadn't had any further intention in visiting the Met than viewing some great art, but I came out with a program idea. Those things can pop up anywhere! I've gotten random program inspiration from museums, gardens, strolls through neighborhoods...really, inspiration can be anywhere. And thank goodness for that, too, because it helps keep programming fresh, interesting, and engaging--for my kiddos and for me.The topic of finding library inspiration from museums turned into a Twitter convo, then a Pinterest board, between me, Melissa Techman, and Sophie Brookover. Check out the board, which is in its very early stages.What have been your unconventional sources of library inspiration?"},
{"title": null, "date": "Monday, May 6, 2013", "text": "There's been a lot of back and forth lately about the topic of using technology--namely, tablets and apps--in children's services, especially with regard to preschool-age children. A lot of it has been happening on list servs and in blog comments, and some of it has been heated; this is a topic about which librarians feel strongly. I think it's time I formally weigh in, at least preliminarily.It probably comes as no surprise that I fall on the \"pro\" side: I do believe that mindfully adding technology to my youth services toolbox is a good, appropriate thing. I've used apps in story time and in school-age programs. I talk to colleagues about best practices and best apps. I actively seek out information that can help me make informed decisions about when, why, and how to incorporate what types of technology with children. And I have two main reasons for doing so.It is my job as a youth services librarian to support and develop literacy, and literacy is multi-facted. So much press and conference time is spent on the message that librarians are early literacy experts. We should be, and we are, but early literacy is only part of the equation. I serve all children with all abilities from all backgrounds; limiting myself to early literacy is excluding a wide range of children I am meant to serve. Children--nay, all people--need competency with a variety of literacies in order to interact productively with the world. Thus I try very hard to support development of all literacies: early literacy, science literacy, cultural literacy, social literacy, and digital literacy. Yes, digital literacy is vital. In fact, research from the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood, Alliance for Childhood, and Teachers Resisting Unhealthy Children's Entertainment indicates that children who enter school without the ability to productively interact with and use technology are at disadvantages and deficits similar to those children who enter school without knowledge of letters and word sounds. I include technology in my children's services because it supports vital literacies, and not all children are able to access materials and develop skills elsewhere.It is my job as a library employee to support my library's vision, which includes customer centered services. That bit about customer centered services is expanded on in our strategic plan, and it involves the following wording: meet the customers where they are. It is becoming ever more apparent, through both formal reference interactions and casual on-the-service-floor conversations and observations that caregivers are using this technology with their children. Using tablets and apps is where they are, and to support my library's vision--to do my job--it's where I need to be, too. I need to be able to engage in the conversations about the topic of technology with children. One way I can do that effectively is to demonstrate how technology can be a seamless part of life's activities where children are concerned. I can show how what adult customers already do with their kids can be done intentionally and meaningfully. Again, based on my library's vision, I believe that's my job.This post doesn't even begin to touch on when and how I use technology in my services to children and their families. And while these are not the only reasons why I do incorporate technology, I believe they are the clearest reasons--perhaps the most obvious to me. As these conversations about the topic continue and develop, I know one of my benchmarks for assessing the services I provide will be the goals inherent to my position as a children's librarian within my institution."},
{"title": null, "date": "Friday, May 3, 2013", "text": "Lately I've been thinking about why, specifically, I dedicate work time and energy to working with teen volunteers. Ask many a library person and you'll hear that teens don't always have the best image in the library: they can be loud, unprofessional, unreliable, late, unmotivated. And I can see how that reputation can turn some libraries off from working with teen volunteers, even when they have tasks that could be aided by volunteer hands.Me, though? I think it's worth it. And not just because teen volunteers can do the cutting, stickering, and scanning that aren't high on staff's list of priorities. No, I work with teen volunteers for other reasons.Why I Work with Teen VolunteersTeens need to see that their communities value them. And the library absolutely does value teens. We value the passion they bring to the things they care about. We value their dedication to their friends, families, and beliefs. We value their input about what they like to read, watch, and do. And we value the contributions they are able and willing to make to an organization they believe in.Teens need a chance to develop their work ethic and skills. So you think teens are late, loud, and unprofessional? How can they learn to act otherwise in an appropriate environment if we always ask them to leave the library? I am a firm believer that teens need mentoring, even informally, to see that they are worthy of respect and recognition for their work.Teens need to feel that what they do is important. I remember being a teenager with stacks of homework assignments and other tasks that seemed pointless; who were they going to help, really? It is entirely within the power of the library to give teens meaningful work, and to allow them to see the positive impact their work has.Lots of teens need service hours for school, clubs, and applications. And while I recognize that not every teen who submits a volunteer application is gung-ho about the library, I strive to give them the benefit of the doubt. Sure, maybe they're just volunteering because they need so many hours for NHS; but hopefully they can have some positive interactions with adults and other teens in the process.And one of the biggest reasons I work with teen volunteers is...Teens can be tireless advocates for the library. If teens care about something, they will talk about it--to their friends, their families, their acquaintances. I've seen volunteers telling anyone who will listen about the books they \"must read.\" I've had volunteers offer to put signs on their lockers--even wear a sandwich board sign at school--to promote programs and author visits they care about. I've overheard some of my volunteers talking about summer reading at local restaurants, and they don't even realize I'm there. If teens love the library, feel it is a place of value, they will spread that message far better and to more diverse populations than our traditional marketing can do.Teens really are a vital part of the operation of my library. It may take some work and time on the part of staff, but I wouldn't have it any other way.~~*~~Do you work with teen volunteers in your library? Why?"},
{"title": null, "date": "Wednesday, May 1, 2013", "text": "At the beginning of April, my district's Early Literacy Task Force, of which I am a member, offered a three-hour training to give children's staff some hands-on experience with the revised ECRR. Staff saw a sample workshop for parents; had time to practice creating and sharing early literacy statements; and brainstormed program formats and ideas with colleagues. I facilitated the programming portion of the training:   Programming with ECRR2 in Mind  from Amy Koester A bit more info on my workshop session:All attendees were asked to bring with them 5 copies of a program plan or outline that is their favorite or has been successful in implementation. For the final hour of the training, then, we focused on our story times--nothing abstract, but our programs over which we have ownership. We talked broadly about what we like and don't like, and then we broke into small groups to swap program plans and ideas. The conversations centered around engagement and the five early literacy practices, and attendees left with a myriad of ideas for new program elements, themes, activities, and formats.Based on conversations I've since had with attendees, this programming workshop has encouraged staff think outside of the box of what they usually do for story time; now there is more focus on what else we can add to support writing, per se, or to engage caregivers as well as kids. I'm excited to see what our district story times look like over the next few months as the training ideas make their way into program plans.~~*~~What sort of programming training, if any, do you offer your children's staff? Do staff continue to have program training and idea-swapping throughout the course of their employment, or is training mostly limited to time of hire?"},
{"title": null, "date": "Monday, April 29, 2013", "text": "I blogged earlier this month about a new story time program I began offering in March, a Saturday morning Milk & Cookies Story Morning. My main impetus for this new program format and time was better fitting into the schedules of families who can't necessarily make a weekday story time. So far, I'd say it looks like I'm going to be successful on that front: I was averaging about 6 attendees at my previous Evening Family Story Times; the debut M&C Story Time drew in 17 people; and April's M&C Story Time had 36 people attend. Those are big jumps, and our Saturday morning story times are seeing lots of new faces. I love programs that invite new library users.A few other goals of my Milk & Cookies Story Morning, which of course will continue to develop as the months go on:Make it transmedia. I include app-based technology once in each program. This will be in the form of a book app, felt board story, or musical enhancement.Make it interactive. We roll our song cube to determine what traditional song we sing. We sing and dance to songs heavy on movement aspects. And we end with some parachute fun, which never fails to excite and engage.Include a folk or fairy tale. This goal is a newer one for me, but it's becoming more and more important. After months of visiting preschools and daycares for story time visits, I saw that many kids haven't heard the \"traditional\" folk and fairy tales; it seems grown-ups assume that, because they are traditional, the kids already know them. Not so, and so I'm including one at each program. Kids who have heard them before still delight in retellings.Play time is integral. There is space and time for free play after each of these programs.The April Milk & Cookies Story Time was an encore program of sorts, the second time I offered the new program time and format. As encores go, I would consider it a rousing success. Here's what we did:Opening Song: \"Open, Shut Them\"Story: Scary Mary by Paula Bowles     This story invites lots of open-ended questions about the pictures, what's happening in the story, and the topic of making friends. It also provides great opportunities for making animal noises and motions, a huge bonus for kids' morning energy.Song: \"I'm a Little Teapot\"     A roll of our song cube landed on \"I'm a Little Teapot,\" so the kids and I stood up to sing and act out the song. We had a huge round of applause from the grownups afterward, and I took the opportunity to introduce the word \"encore.\" We offered to sing another song for the grownups, who acted delighted, and we performed \"I'm a Little Teapot\" again.Book App: Just Lost! by Gina and Mercer Mayer from Oceanhouse Media, Inc.     This wonderful Little Critter story follows Little Critter as he gets separated from his mom and siblings at the mall. Oh, no! he thinks; My mom is lost! The story follows Little Critter as he resolves to be brave, tells a grown-up that his mom is lost, and spends a little bit of time amazed at the mall security office before being reunited with his family. As I shared the book app with the audience (it was mirrored on our HDTV), I asked questions about what the kids could see in the pictures, what they thought would happen next, what they would do if their mom or dad got lost. I'll admit I was initially unsure if this app would be too long for the kids' attention spans, but they were totally engaged in the story. They even wanted to share their own lost stories after we were done. Once again, I was blown away by the literacy potential of sharing an app with kids in an intentional and interactive way.Song: \"We Are the Dinosaurs\" by The Laurie Berkner Band     We had a dinosaur marching parade of sorts for this song, with many of the children opting to join the main group in a marching dino circle. A few stayed on the sidelines with their caregivers, but they were definitely stomping their feet and doing the other actions with the music.Story: The Three Little Pigs by Bernadette Watts     This version of the Three Pigs story offers a great intro for new listeners, with great illustrations that can get kids talking about what's happening. The wolf doesn't get cooked in the end of this version, so if that's the tale you want to tell, there are other options.Activity: Parachute Play     I got the parachute out of the bag, and I threw on top of it three beach ball-style globes. The exercise of having fun with the parachute while trying to keep the globes on it was a great activity for concepts of teamwork.Milk & Cookies Time!     This time we had Nilla Wafers, 2% milk, and lemonade. One mother brought her own snacks for her kids due to food allergies, and I was so glad her children were able to participate in that portion of the program.Free Play     I got out three tables' worth of toys again, ranging from wooden garages and cars to counting cookies and building materials. This is the portion of the program that I am most excited about--it offers great opportunities for me to interact with each child, and I can also model behavior for interacting with children as they play. This is also the time in the program when grownups can have conversations, and many of them seek out conversations with me. They ask about great apps, what programs we have coming up, what else the library offers... really, the PR potential of this free time is amazing. And all while the kids are exploring the world through free play.~~*~~I know at least one other librarian, Angela in Nova Scotia, has adapted this program format for her own library customers and goals; see her version here. Anyone else including apps in programming? Offering weekend story time options? Focusing on building kids' knowledge of folk tales? I'd love to hear what you're doing."},
{"title": null, "date": "Friday, April 26, 2013", "text": "A few weeks ago, the winners of the Missouri Readers Awards were announced. I was thrilled to learn that the 2012-2013 Mark Twain Readers Award, chosen by fourth through sixth graders, was given to Sharon M. Draper's Out of My Mind.During the course of this school year, I've had lots of eager middle grade readers come talk to me about the books they were reading and enjoying, and Out of My Mind seemed to always be part of the conversation. And rightly so--this story beautifully illustrates that people are people, despite any appearances or differing levels of ability. We all want friendships, to learn and be challenged, to feel love and appreciation from our families... Simply, we're all human and want to be treated humanely, lovingly. I am ecstatic that young Missouri readers latched on to that message.I've already had a number of kids come ask me for more books like Out of My Mind, and I anticipate many such requests over the next few weeks and into summer reading. To meet that demand--and to help my reference colleagues who don't have as much familiarity with MG titles--I have put together a list of readalikes for Out of My Mind. Brief explanations included.Readalikes for Out of My Mind by Sharon M. Draper, 2012-2013 Mark Twain Readers Award WinnerMockingbird by Kathryn Erskine -- Told from the perspective of a young girl with an ASD, this story wonderfully shows how every person must process difficult feelings and situations in life. How we interact with the world may differ, but we're all still very much a part of it.Wonder by R.J. Palacio -- This novel cannot help but inspire children to be their best selves as it follows Auggie and his classmates on his first foray into a school setting. Like Melody in Out of My Mind, Auggie's special need is visually apparent. This story is told from multiple perspectives, and message that we all want a fair chance at being ourselves rings true.Rules by Cynthia Lord -- This slightly older title is a bit different in that it is the protagonist's younger brother who experiences life with a special need, but the impact of the protagonist's story is no less profound.The Joey Pigza Series by Jack Gantos -- Many a reader has fallen in love with the disheveled and energetic Joey Pigza who, when it comes down to it, unabashedly lives his life the way he knows how. Gotta respect that.The Origami Yoda Series by Tom Angleberger -- Another example of novels told from multiple perspectives, this series subtly demonstrates that we're all different, no exceptions. One kid may be labeled the geek, another the weird one, another the bad attitude kid; but while these differences may distinguish us, they do not define us. There are so many characters in these books for kids to love and commiserate with.~~*~~What titles would you add to this readalike list? What books won state awards this year in your neck of the woods? What sorts of quick readalike lists, if any, will you prepare for summer reading?"},
{"title": null, "date": "Wednesday, April 24, 2013", "text": "Have you ever noticed how outreach visits to preschools and daycares can take you entirely by surprise? Even after a month of taking the same bag of stories and songs out to child care centers, each individual classroom visit has risks. What if the kids have too much energy because it's been raining non-stop and they haven't gotten to run around outside? What if the teacher is so focused on every child sitting perfectly still that every third word the kiddos hear is \"sit,\" completely obfuscating the story? What if the classroom of kids doesn't know what to do with a stranger in their midst and just stares at you despite your pleas to hear their best cow noise?I've encountered each of these situations multiple times, including a handful of instances just in the last month (such is the life of a frequent outreacher). And do you know what I've found to be almost 100% effective in each of these problem scenarios? Interactive story time elements.For me, interactive story time elements are the program parts that I can quickly adapt depending on my audience. For each element, I have a book as well as a more participatory activity. We can do one or the other to suit the mood of the group, and we can do both if the audience really likes a particular story. They all have the potential to get kids wiggling constructively, engaging in literacy, and having fun, all while behaving according to the \"rules\" of the library lady. Ta-da!I've recently been relying on three main interactive elements to make up my springtime story time bag of tricks:Five Little Monkeys Jumping on the Bed - This favorite fingerplay of childhood is always a hit with my child care center groups; they love helping to count off the monkeys and jump their fingers up and down to the rhythm of the rhyme. By the end, everyone is saying in their best doctor voice: \"No more monkeys jumping on the bed!\" Eileen Christelow, whose five monkey ouevre can span plenty of story times on its own, also offers great read-alouds for after the kiddos have acted out the bedtime rhyme and are clamoring for more monkeys.The Three Little Pigs - I have something of a personal crusade to make sure all kids get to kindergarten with knowledge of the core folk and fairy tales. The Three Little Pigs is certainly among those tales, and I love any opportunity to read or tell that story. For groups that are not yet familiar with the story--and there are plenty who've never heard it, trust me--I do an oral telling of the tale. For groups that already know what happens to the pigs and the Big Bad Wolf, I jump right into Claudia Rueda's Huff & Puff, a great retelling with a twist. In this telling, the audience does the huffing and puffing, with great results in the illustrations. I don't want to ruin the final surprise; check it out and give it a shot.There Was a Tree - I remember singing some version of this cumulative song from my grade school days, and I encountered a few different versions at summer camp. Regardless of the song's origins, it's lots of fun to share with preschoolers. I've done it three ways: entirely sung, while I play the ukulele; sung with the help of felt pieces as visual clues; and read via the version illustrated by Rachel Isadora. By the end of any of these tellings, the children are in stitches of laughter as a result of the downhill-effect speed of the last verse: \"Oh, the bug on the wing, and the wing on the chick, and the chick from the egg, and the egg in the nest, and the nest on the branch, and the branch on the tree, and the tree in the hole, and the hole in the ground, and the green grass grew all around and around, and the green grass grew all around.\" Whew!~~*~~What are some of your favorite interactive elements to take to outreach story times, where the crowd can vary?"},
{"title": null, "date": "Monday, April 22, 2013", "text": "I like to offer some sort of library program that ties in with National Poetry Month each April. This year, in an attempt to attract more kids to the program, I decided to tie together two creative mediums: poetry and art. What follows are details of the resulting program, Pop Art Poetry.Pop Art PoetryWhen I opened up the program room for the attendees (twice as many as last year--improvement!), the children were able to find themselves places around a big table with all our craft supplies on top. After introducing myself and learning their names, I told them that our program would combine pop art, a brightly visual type of art, and poetry. To introduce some the feel of pop art, I shared 5 images from Roy Lichtenstein, Tom Wesselmann, Wayne Thiebaud, Robert Indiana, and Andy Warhol. We briefly discussed how these artists of the Pop Art movement portrayed everyday items in new, vivid ways.We then turned to a brief poetry introduction. We talked about adjective poems--choose a noun, then choose adjectives to describe it, and voila, a poem! One girl wanted to write haikus, so we refreshed on haiku 5-7-5 format. And we also talked about onomatopoeia, those wonderful words that make the sound the represent. Armed with these poetical tools, we were ready to spend the remaining 40 minutes on our masterpieces.Our supplies:mixed media weight paper from the craft store, 11\" x 17\"paint daubers (perfect for that Lichtenstein aesthetic, and fast-drying)print origami paper (for paper crafting)letter stickersmarkersscissorsglue sticksI had scrap paper and pencils for the kids to draft their poems before starting on the full \"canvas,\" and they all took a few minutes to craft their poetry. One girl decided to do a series on the seasons; a few opted to write about pets; and one boy wrote a poem about a rainbow. Once they were satisfied with their poems, they got to creating their pop art poems.One attendee made me a pictureafter finishing her poems.Since this was a school-age program, the kids were very self-directed as far as working with the supplies on hand. As a result, the hands-on creative time was spent in conversation. These children were eager to talk about their favorite artists, what they'd been reading lately... Really, the conversation just flowed naturally, and the kids were able to get to know one another and have a relaxed evening at the library. I worked in some plugs for upcoming programs at the branch, and the kids shared what they were excited about attending.The final products of the Pop Art Poetry program were brightly colored and lyrical, perfectly blending the visual and linguistic arts I hoped to combine in the program. Most of the children headed home before I had a chance to get pictures of their creations (one did create a picture for me, though), but I'll tell you what--instead of taking my word for it how great their pictures were, why don't you offer this sort of program and see for yourself what your children come up with?"},
{"title": null, "date": "Friday, April 19, 2013", "text": "Today's guest post comes from Miss Melanie, a children's staffer at my library. She is sharing a terrifically fun and engaging STEAM program that she offered during our school district's spring break. Take it away, Miss Melanie!Marble Run ManiaMy idea for a recent children’s Science Technology Engineering Arts Mathematics (STEAM) library program evolved after cleaning up from a Time for Twos program and pondering the “likes” of children.  In tipping a long table on its end, a toy train engine left by a child zoomed down the table and crashed to the floor.  I couldn’t resist.  I did it again. Tip, roll, crash.  Tip, roll, crash. Fun!   I remember thinking, I can use this, and tucked it away in the recesses of my brain.Weeks later I’m pondering what type of program will accomplish STEAM goals with 20+ rambunctious children during their spring break.  Call me a geek, but I will sometimes web diagram my thoughts. Speed, tape, movement, tubes, building, create, pipe cleaners, noise, and cutting were just some of the many words I wrote on my web.  What would my own kids like?  Aha! The Marble Run Mania idea was born.With  supportive co-workers who will collect anything for me, one trip to Leftovers, Etc. (a not-for-profit creative and educational resource facility), and a few consumables (electrical and duct tape, pipe cleaners) the program was literally ready to roll...out the marbles.On the day of the event, I displayed all the possible products collected for building marble runs.  I placed three long tables end to end, piled with recyclables:  paper towel/gift wrapping and paper/plastic/pvc tubes; egg cartons, binder clips, pipe cleaners, milk jugs with holes in the bottoms, detergent lids; and some unusual parts of things like the broken frame around a felt board, creating a straight track.   Anticipating around 30 kids, I set up six stations by tipping six tables.  One set of legs was resting on the floor; the other set was placed in two chairs to create a slant. Remember the train zooming down the table?  Voila!  Our marble runs would be constructed against the slanted table top so the force of gravity would be in our favor.  Each group was allotted a supply of tape, scissors, and other consumables.As the children entered the room, a teen volunteer handed them a shoebox with a marble in it.  I wanted to get the “juices” flowing for the project so I prompted the children with several questions:  Keeping the marble in the box, what can you do with it?  See how it rolls?  What makes it roll?  Can you make it touch all four sides with and without it rolling along the edges of the box?  What else can you do with it?Once the majority of the group arrived, I polled them for their background knowledge of marble runs.  To create our own runs, I demonstrated how we would use the slanted tables to assist us with creating a run to finalize at an end point.  I used duct tape to tape a paper towel tube to the table to show the marble running through it.  What is a deflector and what does it do? What recyclables would make a good deflector?The kids were divided into groups roughly by age unless they came as their own group.  To provide some structure and a starting point, I suggested they start at the highest point of their table and choose something the marble could shoot through.  Paper towel rolls were the first to go, and kids got the hang of the taping quite quickly.  Back and forth to the product tables they went, choosing just the right object for the next link in their run.  Teen volunteers assisted with tape ripping, holding parts in place, and making themselves available on all fronts.  They did an excellent job of allowing the youths to create and implement without overtaking the project.  I asked the teens to prompt kids with open-ended questions if the kids fell stuck on a part.  Again, the teen volunteers were found encouraging and asking, \"What would work best next?\"While navigating around the room, I incorporated as many scientific terms as I could into their building process without sounding preachy. \"I see you chose the milk jug lid as a deflector.  The marble richochets into the tube.  Cool. What happens when you add another deflector?  Tell me about this part.  I see the marble runs slowly through that part?  Why?  What would increase the speed of the marble?\" I used terms such as gravity, weight, launch, roll, bump, drop, bounce, heavy, and force.  I was genuinely interested in their processes.Many groups found challenges along the way.  Why won’t the marble go through?  Was the opening too small?  Was there an obstruction? Was tape sticking to the marble? The tape won’t work. They aligned tunnels, made long drops,  plunked marbles, re-aligned, and finally--success!  Some decided to add on or make another branch to the run.  Others made a whole new run next to the original.The diversity of the marble runs was amazing.  One child continued to attach paper towel tubes together well past his own station and into the next.  Some, with the help of a parent, made various chambers like in pinball machines.  Tape was used in abundance.We spent the last minutes eagerly making our way around the room trying each other’s marble runs.  Kids whose parents hadn’t been building with them proudly gave their parents marbles to drop down lengthy chutes, explaining what they did and watching the marble finally plop into the end container.The final attendance count was 58, and overall I was pleased with the results of the build.  I will modify a few things for next time: prior to the build, I’ll have the teen volunteers build a marble run made of completely different materials than what the kids will be building with; providing more types of tubing materials; and starting my collecting earlier. Also, dismantling runs at the end by the teen volunteers and myself was time consuming, but well worth the effort. We were able to salvage some things... to be used for the next builds. I’d also inspire groups to create a name for their building teams and to create a name for their marble run.  I can’t wait to do this again!"},
{"title": null, "date": "Wednesday, April 17, 2013", "text": "My branch library has had a thriving Teen Advisory Board for years. I think our group is perennially successful for multiple reasons: it provides teens an outlet for socialization; it recognizes that kids from different schools, clubs, and cliques may have something larger in common; and it allows teens a chance to carve out a meaningful space in their community. TAB is great.So, of course, I wanted one for my kids.This spring, I advertised a new Kids Advisory Board program for children between the ages of 10 and 12 (they have specifically asked that I not call them \"tweens,\" a word they dislike) and put out some flyers with the mention of snacks in hopes of drawing some attention. I also personally invited many of the pre-teens I see in the library often.I know that any new type of program is going to take some time to gain attendees, so I wasn't unhappy with the turnout at our inaugural meeting earlier this month. There were three pre-teens seated around the table with me, and they were definitely excited to be the \"founding members\" of the Kids Advisory Board. They were so excited and chatty, in fact, that I didn't need to break out the icebreaker game I had planned; instead, they all bonded over the fact that they all have retainers.Retainers! Gosh, I love my job.After we got to know one another, I spent a few minutes talking about what KAB meetings would look like before getting into the meat of the meeting. Our KAB members engaged in three library topics during this meeting, a format which will continue in the future:Programming -- I was frank about wanting the KAB members' opinions about programs; what they like, what they want to see, themes they would enjoy. As a direct result of their advice and enthusiasm, I'm going to work on securing a live animal presenter as well as offering a Percy Jackson program over the summer.Service -- I want kids to be actively involved in the library so that they feel they have pride and ownership in the space and what happens in it. During this first meeting, we talked about what service projects might look like. Next month the KAB members will help create a matching game for our summer reading kick-off party, and after that we'll look at projects to support our early literacy programs.Reading -- These kids are voracious readers, and they love to talk about what they're reading. Since I was surrounded by such enthusiastic readers, I mentioned my Newbery position and that I would love to hear what they think about any 2013 books they read. I was amazed at how thrilled these kids were at the prospect of helping me understand how kids are responding to books.As we finished up talking about reading and book discussion, the tornado sirens went off, which meant everyone in the library joined us in the room where we were having our meeting. Thus ended our first Kids Advisory Board meeting. I look forward to seeing how conversations, motivations, and friendships develop over the coming months as we continue to meet; I hope that our founding members keep participating and bring other library-loving friends into the mix. Mostly, I hope that these kids will feel like the library is a place specifically for them, where they can be themselves and be a part of something, perhaps for the first time, that doesn't involve their moms or dads. I'll keep you posted."},

{"title": null, "date": "Friday, April 12, 2013", "text": "A few times each school year, high schoolers in our community come to the library in pursuit of short stories; their English classes require them to read, analyze, and write about a short story by an author they do not read in class. Thus I am always on the lookout for short story collections that will a) appeal to teens, and b) provide ample fodder for textual analysis. I think Sightings: Stories by B.J. Hollars provides both appeal and substance.Sightings is a collection of ten short stories, all of which loosely touch on those life experiences that prove to be very meaningful after the fact--the watershed moments when we realize something about how the world works. Hollars writes about the year Sasquatch played for the high school basketball team; a father's obsession with the pioneer past of his forebears, which embarrasses his young son; and the summer new neighbors shook things up in the neighborhood. All of the stories are vividly told, and as a result they feel entirely relatable--I can envision teen readers thinking, \"Yes! Something like that happened to me, too!\" While Hollars didn't set out to write short stories for young adults, they are just as much a part of his audience as adult readers.Hollars is at his best when his stories are told from the perspective of boys on the cusp of growing up, and he deftly captures what is feels like to live through a seemingly ordinary experience--the stuff of everyday life--that ultimately becomes part of a personal mythology. \"Dixie Land,\" the story I found most intriguing in the wholly enjoyable collection, has an air of Vonnegut to it that rings of deep, unsettling truth. Hollars provides plenty of material in these pages for both enjoyment and close reading.The review copy was provided by the publisher, Indiana University Press. I first became aware of Hollars's fantastic storytelling when we worked at the same summer camp in 2006; he remains one of my top two favorite tellers of the Buckethead legend."},
{"title": null, "date": "Wednesday, April 10, 2013", "text": "Collaboration with organizations and populations outside of the library building was a big topic of discussion at last week's SLJ Public Library Leadership Think Tank. I've talked about my library branch's partnerships on this blog previously, but the information shared by panelists, presenters, and colleagues at the Think Tank really opened my eyes to the wider collaborative potential. My favorite sound byte (paraphrased and unattributed, because I can't remember the precise wording or speaker):Collaboration is transformative when you serve the traditionally underserved. And in that process, you'll find new library customers.This idea of serving the underserved was evident in all the collaboration conversations that happened. There's Rachel Payne of the Brooklyn Public Library, who in her collaboration with the Department of Education offers school preparedness program series that have proven to draw new faces beyond her regular story time crowd. There's Nick Higgins of NYPL, who takes early literacy workshops to incarcerated parents so they can foster positive relationships with their children and so they know the library is a friendly place for them upon reentry into society. Both these librarians pursued their collaborative partnerships and programs because of the immense benefits they would bring to the organizations, an untapped population, and their communities as a whole.I think that premise--that collaboration is its most effective when it allows the collaborators to reach outside their usual demographics--is a great thought to really chew on. When do you collaborate? With whom? Why? I'll be asking myself these questions frequently as I consider potential future partnerships, and hopefully the result will be more intentional services with a broader community impact. I want to spend some time thinking about how I can work with other community groups to help the library reach people who are unaware of or are not explicitly impacted by our current range of services.These conversations about collaboration also left me with three great tips for maintaining productive partnerships:Set clear responsibilities and expectations for all collaborative partners.Work, as much as possible, through face-to-face meetings to ensure clear communication.Pursue partnerships with a buddy--i.e., don't be the only representative of your library who is a part of the collaboration. That way multiple library personnel have the knowledge and know-how, and in the event one collaborator moves to new responsibilities, the partnership doesn't stall or have to start from scratch.I'm excited to share these thoughts on collaboration with colleagues within my library district--I know there are some great potential partnerships in our county waiting to be tapped. We've got a big collaborative project this summer with our county parks department, and I'm interested to see what other great services we are capable of through collaboration.I was able to participate in the first SLJ Public Library Leadership Think Tank in New York City. The one-day event, according to SLJ's Editor-in-Chief Rebecca T. Miller, aimed to serve as a lightning strike--a meaningful influx of energy and ideas for the librarians gathered from all over the country.

{"title": null, "date": "Monday, April 8, 2013", "text": "I was at the SLJ Public Library Leadership Think Tank last Friday, where Pam Sandlian Smith of the Anythink Libraries in Colorado was the keynote speaker. Her talk, titled \"If Libraries were Tree Houses,\" contained many great sound bytes and ideas, but she shared one quote that resonated with me more than the others:\"The public library is the center of public happiness first, of public education next.\" -John Cotton DanaThink about that statement for a moment. Is your library a happy place? Are customers happy when they are at the library? Are staff happy? Are you?According to Smith, the power to foster all that happiness lies with us--the staff, the librarians. We have the power to be creative and energetic in how we approach and do the work of libraries. We have the power to innovate, to transform our library, both its spaces and services, into an entity that promotes public happiness in everything we do. Using that power, says Smith, fosters a culture of optimism and, ultimately, better libraries.Smith's talk was inspiring, for sure, but what good is inspiration without thoughtful change? Throughout the whole rest of the weekend and my flight home, I found myself asking: What can I do? I came up with three ways I can shift my own mindset in an effort to foster that culture of optimism:I want to support remarkable, transformative experiences. I want the library to be an active, not a passive, place where customers from all walks of life are engaged. Engaged in conversation, leisure, exploration, play, discovery, story, learning... I want the library to be a place where kids (and everyone!) use their hands as well as their minds.I want to say \"Yes!\" Does someone have an idea? Will it further open our services to the people in our community? Let's give it a shot!I want to be the type of person who says, \"That was awesome. How can we make it even better?\" Innovation and keeping things fresh doesn't always mean reinventing the wheel. Sometimes it means looking at current services more deeply or from a new perspective to really mine the potential for excellence.I am happy with those goals. But, lest you think this whole topic is too hunky-dory, too kumbaya and idealistic rainbows--What if my staff/boss/administrators just don't buy into innovation?--Smith had a response that I really liked. To paraphrase:There will be naysayers, those folks who cite a bunch of worst case scenarios as reason not to innovate or take even a tiny step off the well-trodden paths in library services. There will always be these people. Acknowledge them. But do not let them drive the bus.I love that: let the optimistic people drive the bus. They are the majority, and through some thoughtful work, they can continue to make the library even better.What can you do to foster a culture of optimism at your library?I am grateful that I was able to participate in the first SLJ Public Library Leadership Think Tank in New York City. The one-day event, according to SLJ's Editor-in-Chief Rebecca T. Miller, aimed to serve as a lightning strike--a meaningful influx of energy and ideas for the librarians gathered from all over the country.

{"title": null, "date": "Monday, April 1, 2013", "text": "In my library district, each branch strives to offer a monthly story time option for families whose weekdays are booked--due to work, day care, etc., these families cannot make it to our regular story time series. I had been offering monthly Evening Family Story Times, and while kids always had fun at these programs, they weren't particularly well attended. I know I'm not the only librarian who has wrestled with this issue, but that didn't help solve the problem: despite their expressed intentions, our library families couldn't regularly attend story time on weekday evenings. So, starting in March, I began trying something different: a monthly Milk & Cookies Story Morning, which takes place on a Saturday morning when I was already scheduled to work.Milk & Cookies Story Morning, in addition to taking place on a Saturday morning, boasts a few differences from our regular weekday program series:1) The story time is transmedia; I purposefully include a non-fiction picture book, a fiction picture book, and a book app for the story portions of the program.2) Our songs are very interactive. We choose our first song by rolling the song cube (similar to Anne at So Tomorrow's \"Roll-a-Rhyme\"; funny how one idea can be on the minds of so many librarians at once!), then our later songs all involve substantial motion.3) After our 30-ish minutes of story time, we break for milk and cookies.4) The room is open after the program with plenty of educational toys ready for the kids to play with as long as their parents/caregivers allow.The inaugural Milk & Cookies Story Morning was very successful, in my book: we had 17 attendees (as compared to our usual 5-9 at the previous evening story times); parents were thrilled to get some direction in using apps with their kids; and both kids and caregivers were excited to get down and play with our selection of educational toys, all of which promoted creative building, problem-solving, and/or real-world role play. These families expressed excitement at getting to make the library a destination one Saturday every month, a role I am happy we can play.Here, specifically, is what we did:Opening Song: \"Open, Shut Them\"Story: Homes in Many Cultures by Heather Adamson     I peppered the reading of this simple non-fiction test, full of big, beautiful photos, with questions about the kids' own homes. They really started to engage with the text and were very interested in the different types of homes around the world.Song: \"Head, Shoulders, Knees, and Toes\"     A roll of our song cube prompted us to sing this classic. All the kids, as well as a few of the caregivers, got into the action.Book App: City Animals by Simms Taback, part of the Simms Taback Children's Book Collection app     In preparation for sharing this app in story time, I had hooked up my iPad to our HDTV via Apple 30-pin Digital AV Adapter and HDMI cable. I had cued the app to where I wanted it to start before the program, that way all I needed to do was turn on the television to begin sharing the app. I opted to mute both the iPad and the tv, preferring to read all the text with the kids myself. The kids loved getting hints about the different city animals they were seeing, and they excitedly guessed what the animals were based on their visual and verbal cues. The pacing of the app, while it might seem slow to us grown-ups, was perfect for sharing with a group of kids--the transitions gave all of the kids a good amount of time to process everything they were seeing and thinking. Parents asked for the name of the app after seeing how well their kids responded to it.Story: Goldilocks and the Three Bears by Amanda Askew     I am always taken aback by how many kids are not exposed to \"classic\" tales of childhood. I like to work them into my story times when I can, and they almost always delight. This tale was no exception.Song: \"The Beanie Bag Dance\" by Greg and Steve     I had brought the library's collection of Beanie Babies into the program, and at this point I asked each child to choose a \"beanie buddy\" to help with the song. We used to bean animals as our bean bags for the song.Activity: Parachute Play     Our wrap-up to the formal story time portion of the program was using the parachute. We started off with all the kids grabbing handles, and they tossed their beanie buddies into the parachute for some slow--then fast--parachute action. Then, when temptation could no longer be ignored, the grown-ups helmed the parachute so the kids could enjoy running and sitting under it. Always a hit.Milk & Cookies Time!     I had cookies without nuts, 2% milk, and lemonade available, as well as napkins and small glasses. The caregivers helped their children with their snacks while I opened the other half of our program room for play time.Free Play     I set out selections of the library's educational preschool-age toys: building pipes, build-your-own-creatures, wooden garages and vehicles, shape puzzles, and interlocking wooden blocks. The play stations were on tabletops set directly on the floor, allowing kids to sit on the ground as they played while creating delineated spaces. Every child enjoyed getting to move from station to station at their own pace, enjoying new toys and interacting with peers. I had so many parents thank me for opening the program space for free play, and all of the children were excited to talk about the play activities they were doing. Having the room open post-story time for free play is, hands down, the best way I can think of to really engage kids in that \"play\" practice of ECRR--and it prevents great opportunities for having informal discussions with caregivers, too, allowing library staff to share early literacy tips. If your story time and staff schedules allow it, I highly recommend it.~~*~~An interesting note about including an app in story time: Before sharing the app, I asked parents how many of them a) had tablets or other smart devices and b) used them with their children. All adults present responded to both questions in the affirmative. I was expecting a majority affirmative, but not necessarily the unanimous \"yes\" I got. But there you have it: all of the attending families were already using the technology with their kids. They expressed happiness at the library presenting information about media use and great apps to share with young children; they liked getting some input and direction in how they use the technology to interact with their kids. If there was any semblance of doubt before, I am now 100% in the camp that intentionally incorporating technology in youth services is beneficial for children, caregivers, and library staff."},
{"title": null, "date": "Friday, March 29, 2013", "text": "Can you spot the Arch?I'm always looking for ways in which to engage kids with various learning modalities in my school-age programs. We all know the kids who are all over the Lego Club but would never attend a Valentine craft program; and, on the flip side, there are the kids who get excited about anything involving paint, glitter, and/or feathers but who shy away from anything with \"science\" in the description. I like to brainstorm ways to engage all types of kids with all types of interests all at once, to incorporate elements of crafty with engineering/problem-solving. I think I found a way.Shoe Box Cities was a program I offered for the school-age crowd on an evening during our local spring break. The premise: come to the library to think about what goes into planning a city or town, then make one to take home.I also set out Smarties.Supplies were simple and free: staff members donated the lids of old shoe boxes, and I was given the go-ahead by our local hardware store to nab stacks of paint samples. The only additional building tools were scissors, tape, and markers.I opened the program by asking the children what they like about the place they live--in our neck of the woods, that can include St. Louis. From there, we made a list of all the things we would include in a city if we were in charge of planning it. They covered transportation, sporting arenas, stores, restaurants, the library... I was very impressed at the depth of thought these kids gave to what they would want in a city.Then, for the majority of the program, we built. We had a smaller group--14 people total--and we were all seated in a large square. I joined in the building, but every five minutes or so I would circulate to see the cities-in-progress, asking questions and requisitioning specific colors of paint samples as needed. I loved seeing how willing the kids were to help one another, too; when one figured out a way to make a miniature baseball field, he shared the knowledge with other eager sports fans. We also spent our work time talking about the books we'd been reading; I always love these informal book conversations as a means of quietly championing the joys of reading.By the time the program ended, we had a myriad of interesting, intricate cities. Several children made their dream cities; one made a replica of the street with her school and the nearby grocery store; and one decided to think outside the box and make a shoe box house, complete with bathroom and attached garage.What I think works about programs like this: there are no limits, but there is structure. The open-ended, creative possibility appeals to the artsy crafters, and the \"how would you accomplish this task?\" aspect appeals to the kids who identify themselves as builders and science folks. Everyone enjoys the program content, and, best of all, everyone leaves with a feeling of personal accomplishment. That's a big success, if you ask me."},
{"title": null, "date": "Wednesday, March 27, 2013", "text": "A great Ahsoka costume.My library just hosted our second annual Star Wars Day during our local school district's spring break. I worked with co-workers and teen volunteers to offer a variation on the Jedi Academy program we had last year, and after small bursts of program prep over the last two weeks, I can say that our program was just as much of a hit this time around. Our final count was 216 attendees, plus 5 teen volunteers and 4 staff helping in shifts. Here's what we did:1. Costume Crafts -- Kids were encouraged to show up in costume, but I wanted everyone to have the opportunity to dress festively regardless of what they have at home. I drew templates for two costume headbands: Leia buns and Yoda ears. I printed the templates onto construction paper, and kids could cut and staple to create the costume they wanted.The craft stations2. Droid Toss -- This game was a repeat from last year--so many kids don't know what Bozo Buckets was, so they're intrigued by this \"new\" game. Kids tossed soft balls (meant for pool play) into a series of small trash cans decorated like droids; their reward for their effort was a piece of candy.3. Star Destroyer Navigation -- I put up instructions for a simple paper airplane, which does already resemble a Star Destroyer in shape. Once they had constructed their Star Destroyers, kids tried to navigate their ships through warp speed--hula hoops suspended from the ceiling. Lots of fun, plus kids could take home their Star Destroyers.4. Lightsaber Station -- I expanded on last year's Lightsaber Practice station, wherein young Jedis tried to keep balloons afloat as long as possible using a lightsaber. This time they made their own lightsabers, using a cut out hilt template on white cardstock and a piece of rolled-up neon cardstock for the blade. After creating their own lightsabers, which they could take home, kids tried to balance the balloons.5. Destroy the Death Star! -- It takes precision with a laser gun to shoot down the Death Star, as we all learned in Episode IV. I made a posterboard Death Star, affixed it to a cardboard box, and cut a 4\"x4\" hole in the setup; kids then stood behind a masking tape line with a \"laser blaster\" (Nerf gun) and attempted to make the Death Star-destroying shot. The reward, aside from blowing-up noises from me, was a piece of candy.6. Jedi Library -- I put out Star Wars books we had on the premises as well as several copies of everything from the Origami Yoda universe. The Jedi Library also boasted instructions for folding Origami Yoda, a template for making a Fortune Wookiee, a life-size cut-out of Darth Vader, and some great Star Wars READ posters from ALA. Lots of books checked out.7. Jedi Archives Trivia -- I recycled the trivia questions a volunteer made for us last year. This time our trivia station was located at the reference desk--an attempt to keep people circulating throughout the library during the event. The very accommodating adult reference staff asked the young Jedi questions (easy, medium, or hard), for which they were rewarded with their choice of Star Wars sticker.Three of the 501st posed with kids in their Yoda ears.8. Imperial Photo Ops -- I feel lucky to have local members of the 501st Legion who are available to attend my Star Wars programs. Their in-universe costumes are meticulous, and there's nothing quite like a young Star Wars fan getting to see a full-size, \"real\" Storm Trooper. Any library (or other group, for that matter) can submit a request for an appearance on their website; the more notice you give them, the better the chance they can attend. We had 4 costumed members of the 501st at our program this year, and they spent their time posing for photos with the kids, walking the library, and trying some of the activities. (We had cookies and lemonade for them in a staff area for when they wanted a break.)We made a few substantial modifications to the program itinerary this time around. First, we spread the program over 3 hours instead of scrunching it all into one; we advertised the program as come-anytime-during-the-event in the hopes that our large number of attendees would be spread out (as opposed to the 170 people in our relatively small room in one hour last year). This switch was definitely successful--we had a bunch of people in the first hour, then a slower period in the middle, followed by a second influx of families in the after-work 5-6 p.m. hour.Second, to provide kids more bang for their buck, we added more multi-step craft components--to engage kids longer and more meaningfully. We still offered a number of carnival-style games, but the juxtaposition with longer hands-on activities expanded everyone's Star Wars Day experience while providing them with cool take-homes.I highly encourage any and all libraries to offer some sort of Star Wars-themed event/craft station/etc. The kids love it, the parents and caregivers get really into it, and there are plenty of opportunities to be part of a larger library celebration throughout the year. There's May the 4th Be With You coming up, then Star Wars Reads Day in October. Make plans--these are the library programs you've been looking for."},

Here's what my staff and I have been doing:Animals Misbehavin'Opening Song: \"Open, Shut Them\"Story: Giggle, Giggle, Quack by Doreen Cronin     This story, about a farmer who goes on vacation and leaves his brother in charge of some mischievous animals, affords great opportunities for paying close attention to the pictures. I ask the children to pay attention to Duck--he's trouble!--and the object that he picks up. By the end of the story, the whole room feels in on the secret that Duck has been playing jokes on the farmer and his brother.Fingerplay: \"Five Little Monkeys Jumping on the Bed\"     I encourage the kiddos to use their five \"monkeys\" to help me with this rhyme while I use my finger puppets. Throughout each chorus, children make their fingers jump up and down on the bed; they get really into saying the rhyme. What a great way to work on fine motor skills with finger movement while also engaging in rhyming, counting, and cause and effect.Story: Horseplay! by Karma Wilson     Does anyone rhyme quite as well as Karma Wilson these days? My children always seem captivated by the lyrical nature of the text, and this amusing story of some horses intent on playing all the time was no exception. The fanciful pictures are a hoot, too.Rhyme: \"I Went to the Zoo Today\"I Went to the Zoo TodayI went to the zoo today!And what did I see?I saw a great big elephant*Looking at me![make elephant* noises]     We repeated this rhyme multiple times, inserting a new zoo animal each time. My favorite unexpected moment was when a child suggested \"zebra\"--the whole room immediately making a buzzing \"Z\" sound. Not quite the sound a zebra makes, but definitely a sound we make when we say \"zebra!\"Story: Kitten's First Full Moon by Kevin Henkes     Kitten doesn't really misbehave in this story, although she does get into some messy situations while in pursuit of the full moon, which she mistakes to be a bowl of milk. This Caldecott winner boasts a lovely, quiet story along with the beautiful illustrations, making the book a great closer for a story time.Song: \"If You're Happy and You Know It\"Other materials on hand: Is Everyone Ready for Fun? by Jan Thomas; Old MacDonald Had a Farm by Jane Cabrera; \"Apples and Bananas\" on the ukulele     Spring outreach often means visiting preschools where the classrooms span a number of ages. This main \"Animals Misbehavin'\" story time might not be appropriate for all ages and audience attention spans, so my outreach bag also included a few shorter stories and some additional lyrical elements. I'm lucky in that my staff, who occasionally go out on these outreach visits, feel confident about choosing books and interactives that fit the crowd; I just make sure the Story Time bag has plenty of great options."},

We recently had two new features installed.Early Literacy Stations in Picture Book CityFirst are the AWE Early Literacy computers. I interned at a library with three of these computer stations, and a few other branches of my current library district had the stations when I was hired. I immediately put Early Literacy Stations on my branch wish list. The machines were budgeted for this fiscal year and installed in Picture Book City last week, and they are already a hit with our young customers and their families. Within five minutes of the computers being set up, a three-year-old was exploring an Elmo game with her father sitting next to her. They were having great conversations about letters, talking about how to click with a mouse, and exploring all the stations have to offer. It's only been a few days since these computers were installed, and already I've seen other great child-caregiver interactions happening at our Early Literacy Stations on multiple occasions.Child-height endcap OPAC in the children's areaNext are endcap OPACs that are situated in the chilren's area--one inside Picture Book City, and the other on the end of our range of J Bios and award-winners. These OPACs are mounted at a great height for children to use them, and use them they do. I was slightly surprised at the uptick in children doing their own catalog searches before asking for help at the reference desk; it appears having the OPACs in the midst of the library spaces kids already use really does make a difference. Since these endcap OPACs were installed last week, I have seen more school-age children using them; more caregivers narrating their search processes for their onlooking children; and more caregivers feeling less stressed about doing several searches at a time because they can now access the catalog while still within sight of their children playing in Picture Book City. Talk about making things easier for customers!That's what's new in the children's area of my library these days. What new or interesting things might your customers find in your spaces?"},

{"title": null, "date": "Wednesday, March 13, 2013", "text": "Two things happened recently: Marge at Tiny Tips for Library Fun wrote a fantastic series on school/public library partnerships, and I was asked if my library would staff a table at a local elementary school's Title I night.Perhaps I should clarify. My branch library has longstanding relationships with several of our local schools; we make regular appearances at the beginning of the school year on back-to-school nights, during the winter at literacy events, and before school gets out in May for summer reading rallies. We definitely have an existing partnership with our school district, at least on a basic level. Basically: they ask us to attend an event, and we do.Marge's posts got me thinking about these events a bit more deeply, though. Why was I/the library attending? What did I/the library hope to accomplish by having a presence at the event? Those were the questions I asked myself as I set up my library table (note my I Spy Board--completely Abby the Librarian's idea--it adds color and interest to the table and gets kids to stop instead of just walking past). Here are a couple of the answers I came up with:I have a presence in local schools in order to...share library homework resources with current library cardholders who don't know they can access them from homeexplain how to get a library card for non-cardholdersinform families new to the area about the library districtengage kids in conversations about readinggive some examples of the variety of great books available for kidsdemonstrate that reading isn't just an in-school activitypromote library programs and resourcesFeeling pretty happy with that least of motivations and intentions, I settled into my \"library booth\" personality for the evening.But then.The event was 90 minutes long, but I only really saw students and their families for around 40 minutes in the middle of that block of time. During the event, I primarily saw and talked to teachers, the school librarian, and the principal. And yet I had forgotten to include them when considering why I was at the event in the first place.A lightbulb went off in my head during the last half hour of the event. That's when I started engaging teachers and the principal in conversations about what books their students were reading. A fourth-grade teacher mentioned sharing The One and Only Ivan with his class in January, and we got to talking about the Newbery Award and what previous winners he has shared with his students. I chatted with the principal about his goals for reading across the student body. These conversations got the wheels spinning in my head regarding how I might partner with specific teachers, classrooms, and schools.Now I've got plans for how to pursue more meaningful partnerships with interested area schools, from getting kids more involved in the lead-up to summer reading to visiting classrooms to talk about the history of the Newbery Award, which committee members are encouraged to do. I've got ideas about working with principals to create school-wide--perhaps even district-wide--reading initiatives that don't place all of the burden of providing resources on school libraries and school budgets.I am, in short, excited about the prospect of partnering more meaningfully with local schools. Sure, I'll still show up when they request a library presence at a school event. But in the future, I hope our work together will be so much more than that."},
{"title": null, "date": "Monday, March 11, 2013", "text": "One of my goals for 2013 is to share apps that I'll be incorporating in my library, whether as part of programs, in-library displays, or app advisory. Today I want to focus on three of the presentation apps that I regularly use to supplement my programming. I use them all different and in different programming scenarios. They are all available for free for the iPad.SlideSharkHow it works: The SlideShark app accesses slideshows that the user has uploaded to his or her online SlideShark account. An account is free, although it does come with a storage limit of 100 MB (plan upgrades run from $49-$95 per year). Users are able to upload presentations (Powerpoint, Keynote) to their accounts; sync desired presentations to an iPad; and share presentations publicly if desired. When connected to a projector and in presentation mode, SlideShark allows users to time their presentations and see their presentation notes. Users can also set presentations to autoplay with options of slide length and looping.When I use it: So far I have used SlideShark for two types of programs. The first is for presentations for library staff and workshops for caregivers. When I offered early literacy workshops for our local Parents as Teachers group last autumn, I modified the official ECRR2 slideshow to reflect my specific content. During the event, I managed the entire presentation as I went, choosing when I moved from slide to slide. I loved having my notes visible to me on the iPad while caregivers only saw the slides.     The second type of program for which I've used SlideShark is a school-age program in which I wanted a slideshow to be on in the background. A perfect example is my recent potato chip history and tasting program. I shared information on the history of the potato chip at the beginning of the program, but I wanted that information to be on a screen while kids were going about their activities in the room. I uploaded a Powerpoint I'd made, set the presentation to loop and autoplay with slide changes every 15 seconds, and let the app do its thing. Children and caregivers both liked having something interesting and informative to look at between activities.PreziHow it works: The Prezi app makes mobile all the great visual elements of the original online Prezi presentation. A free personal Prezi account comes with 100 MB of storage space (upgrades run from $59-$159 a year) as well as the service's core features, which include beautiful templates, great editing abilities, and useful help services. Prezi presentations can be created and edited both online and in-app, which means last-minute changes to presentations don't require re-syncing the device.When I use it: My favorite use for Prezi presentations so far is in my school-age science programs. Each program opens with a brief introduction to our topic of the day; our brief intros would require a slideshow presentation of just one or two slides, limiting the options for great visual engagement. With Prezi, however, a small amount of information can be presented in a beautiful and visually-exciting way that holds attention much better than static slideshows. I frequently add images, video, bursts of color, and interesting pathways to my Prezis to keep kids' attention.     I've also used Prezi for \"Meet the Artist\" school-age programs, during which lots of artwork by the featured artist is shown for the audience. Prezi makes that artwork pop much more than a slideshow can, and the creative possibilities for setting up the presentation fit better with the mood of an art program.Haiku DeckHow it works: The Haiku Deck app is an all-in-one slideshow creation and presentation app that doesn't require a link to an online account. The app is meant to facilitate creation of simple, beautiful slideshows. Users can manipulate a finite number of aspects of slideshows, which I think really streamlines the creation of great presentations. Users can give a presentation a title and a theme, and each individual slide can contain a title, some additional text (either one line or bulleted/numbered lists), and a full-screen image; there are fourteen slide layout options, and users can add images of their own or search for high-res images in-app.When I use it: I have used Haiku Deck, to great success, for my Stuffed Animal Sleepovers. These story time programs necessitate creating an image-heavy slideshow of photos of kids' stuffed animals doing sleepover activities at the library, then showing that slideshow at a program the next day. Before I had Haiku Deck, that process meant five distinct, and sometimes time-consuming, steps: 1) take photos on the digital camera or library tablet; 2) upload photos to a computer; 3) create the slideshow in Powerpoint; 4) upload the Powerpoint to a slideshow app; 5) show the slideshow. With Haiku Deck, however, the whole process happens on the iPad. I take pictures with the iPad's camera, immediately add them to slides in my slideshow on Haiku Deck, add a bit of text, and I'm ready to present. What was originally a 90-minute or more process was down to about 20 minutes. The slideshows are beautiful, image-focused, and shareable with a link, which caregivers who want a copy of the slideshow really appreciate.~~*~~Those are the three presentation apps you'll be most likely to find me using in the course of my library work. Do you have any apps you rely on for presentations? I'd love to hear about them!"},

I previewed my WRAD format last month; I called it \"guerrilla story time\" on Twitter, emphasizing that my goal was to engage children who happened to be in the library on March 6 with an unexpected story time. That's exactly what happened, too.My coworkers and I read 12 books and poetry selections for World Read Aloud Day--one for every hour the library was open. We announced the events over the PA system, and as we walked back to Picture Book City to do the readings, we encouraged any interested kids to come listen for a few minutes. Many kids did, and they all had smiles on their faces. Ah, the simple joys of being treated to a story read aloud.We had over 100 people enjoy our WRAD read alouds, and almost all of the children and grownups opted to add their names to our reading wall afterward. I would call this program a definite success, especially when one considers that we didn't have any formal programs (story time, Lego Club) going on during the day to draw people to the library in the first place. Our participants were people who are happy to set aside what they are doing for a few minutes to enjoy reading. When all is said and done, the names on our reading wall show that we are a community who values literacy. I encouraged everyone to share the books they love with people they love, and they assured me they would read it forward.In case you're curious, here's the breakdown of what books we read when:9:30 a.m. - Pete the Cat and His Four Groovy Buttons by Eric Litwin10:30 a.m. - It's a Tiger! by David LaRochelle11:30 a.m. - Under Ground by Denise Fleming12:30 p.m. - Boy + Bot by Ame Dyckman1:30 p.m. - Eggs 1 2 3: Who Will the Babies Be? by Janet Halfmann2:30 p.m. - If I Built a House by Chris Van Dusen3:30 p.m. - Miss Nelson is Missing by Henry Allard4:30 p.m. - Eleanor, Quiet No More: The Life of Eleanor Roosevelt by Doreen Rappaport5:30 p.m. - exerpts from A Pizza the Size of the Sun by Jack Prelutsky6:30 p.m. - Let's Sing a Lullaby with the Brave Cowboy by Jan Thomas7:30 p.m. - How Rocket Learned to Read by Tad Hills8:30 p.m. - exerpts from Where the Sidewalk Ends by Shel Silverstein~~*~~Did you celebrate World Read Aloud Day?

That energy, my now-boss says, came across in my interview. I was so gung-ho in my interview, in fact, I even used the phrase, \"Even if you don't hire me, you have to do this.\"I was referring to creating an early literacy calendar.It's now over a year and a half later, and my library district does indeed have an early literacy calendar. Each month, we create and make available a calendar full of simple suggestions for early literacy activities that caregivers and their children can do almost anywhere--non-intimidating activities that build pre-reading skills. The activities are based around the ECRR five practices with some math thrown in. The children's staff across the library district take turns filling in the monthly templates I've created; each branch is tasked with populating a calendar with activities every 9 months. For that relatively small amount of work on the part of our children's staff, the benefit to our communities is significant.We hand out early literacy calendars at our baby, twos, and preschool programs. We have copies of the calendar available at the check-out desk. We share the calendars with local preschools and day cares, encouraging them to make photocopies for the parents of their charges. We post a link to the current calendar on our website, and I have started sharing the pdf on our Library Foundation's new blog. We pass it out when we register pre-readers for summer reading. When workloads and budgets allow, I want our graphic design guy to rework the look so we can make the calendars available at grocery stores and doctors' offices.If dreams came true, our early literacy calendars would end up in the hands of every caregiver in our county who spends time with a pre-reader. We librarians know how seemingly simple activities can have a great impact--and we often have thousands of potential activities bouncing around our brains, ready to meet the needs of our communities. Now those activities and tips can reach a wider audience. That's why we offer an early literacy calendar."},
{"title": null, "date": "Monday, March 4, 2013", "text": "Back in December of 2011, Lisa Taylor of the Ocean County (NJ) Library shared her library's successful Black History Month program on ALSConnect (you'll need to log in to ALSC to view the original write-up). By pairing the story of the invention of the potato chip with a potato chip tasting, Taylor and her colleagues had hit on a formula for a successful history-centered program. I immediately bookmarked it.I was able to offer my take on Taylor's program last week, and I would definitely count it a success. I kept Taylor's original name--excitement rings through a great program name!--and tweaked the program content so I could offer it to school-age kids as well as any preschoolers who wanted to attend. I ended up with a good balance between the two. Here's what I did:Bet You Can't Eat Just One!1. As children and their caregivers entered the program room, they took seats facing the wall where I would project images. I engaged the attendees in some chit-chat about potato chips while waiting for everyone to arrive.2. I told the story of George Crum and the invention of the potato chip. I love non-fiction storytelling, and I drew information from a few sources for my telling of the potato chip's creation. My four sources were the picture book George Crum and the Saratoga Chip by Gaylia Taylor; Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's great non-fiction title What Color is My World? The Lost History of African-American Inventors; the Wonderopolis page on \"Who Invented Potato Chips?\"; and the entry on Crum in our Biography in Context database.3. I showed a video of how potato chips are made in a potato chip factory. I narrated the steps of the process during this video, which has no voiceover.4. We had our potato chip tasting. Six different types of chips were available in bowls around the room. Each chip type was assigned a number, and the names of the chips were not visible; I did, however, make the ingredients available by the chips in case of food allergies. Each child picked up a coffee filter to serve as a plate, a tasting ballot, and a marker. Because I wanted the program to work for a wide age range of children, the ballot operated on a smily face system; if a child liked Chip #1, for instance, he or she could circle the smiling face. If a child did not like Chip #4, he or she could circle the frowning face. The symbol system was easy for the kids to understand. After everyone had tasted all of the chips, I handed out juice boxes to cleanse our palates.5. While the tasters were letting their palates get back to neutral between rounds of tasting, I projected a short slideshow onto the program room wall. The slides highlighted the history of the potato chip, from information on Crum and the snack's invention up to its mass marketing and the huge consumption of chips by Americans.6. Children got to go around and taste each chip again, this time with a mind toward choosing their favorite. Each child and adult in the tasting told me what number chip was their favorite, and I tallied the votes.7. While announcing our winners of the potato chip tasting, I also announced what the different chips were. Our overall favorite was Ruffles, followed closely by Lays Classic. The remaining four flavors--sea salt and vinegar, Maui onion, cracked pepper and sea salt, and parmesan garlic--all tied for third place.8. Children then chowed down on their favorite chips while we all talked about what we've been reading lately. I love these informal moments at the end of programs to chat about books! My source material all checked out after the program, too.I would definitely classify this program as a success, something that I'll look at revisiting every few years. The kids were all very interested in hearing the history of one of their favorite snack foods, and they thrived on being asked for their opinions on what chips tasted good. Any day a fourth grader engages me in a conversation about the mouthfeel of a food is sure to be a good day.~~*~~How did you celebrate Black History Month in programs at your library?"},

That, of course, is my opinion: that good librarianship requires a degree of collaboration, a willingness to learn from others. I know I couldn't do my job well without my peers--colleagues, friends--who open themselves and their expertise to others.The way I see it, there are a lot of brilliant librarians out there, and they all have something tremendous to offer to the profession. Some excel at offering program successes, some at offering service innovations. Some specialize in research and tips on the work we do with kids, which helps me gain intentionality and purpose; some share insightful ruminations on the profession that give me new perspective on what it is I do. I know that I strive to share everything I can about STEAM programming for kids--that's what I would want to be my niche, were I to have one; and while I would not claim to be the loudest or best voice on that topic (I have some really smart peers!), I do hope I am offering something worthwhile.My peer-sourced flyerI want to contribute because, simply, I take a lot from my peers. That is to say, I peer source. Frequently. Take my recent initiative to get more kids reading our great graphic novel series; why would I start from scratch in making a top ten list when Hannahlily Smith already shared a stellar one on the Nerdy Book Club blog? Sure, I designed the handout I placed in our graphic novel stacks; but the core of the material came from a peer I consider an authority on the subject. I peer sourced it.I peer source themed book selection for impromptu story times. I peer source genre readers' advisory lists. I peer source simple crafts for large groups, and I peer source homeschooling program formats. My library services benefit from all this peer sourcing.Don't get me wrong--I do a lot of original work, as do my peers. But the reason we are able to create so many quality services from scratch is because we look to our peer \"experts\" to fill in the gaps where we may not always be so successful or confident on our own. We look to and learn from the know-how of others. The way I see it, that's an exemplary work model: services are top-notch, staff are developing skills and working efficiently, and children benefit.I'm proud to be a part of a profession that values collaboration and believes we all have something valuable to offer."},

{"title": null, "date": "Friday, February 22, 2013", "text": "Today, as part of the build-up to World Read Aloud Day, I'm going to finish some sentences about reading from the perspectives of both my 10-year-old (4th grade) self and my current grown-up self.Sentence #1: I think everyone in the world should read...10-year-old Amy: Bridge to Terabithia by Katherine Paterson. I loved the idea of having a Terabithia--a special, secret place to go. I remember scrunching up into a corner of my bedroom and pretending that I needed to use my hot pink electronic Dear Diary in order to access my secret hideaway. The password, of course, was \"Terabithia.\"Grown-up Amy: Three Times Lucky by Sheila Turnage. I especially think that everyone in the world should read this story aloud in order to enjoy the stylistically-perfect language as much as the quirky characters and captivating mystery.Sentence #2: If I could listen to anyone in the world read aloud to me it would be...10-year-old Amy: my cousin Stephanie. She lived in New York when I was growing up, which felt very far away from my house in Indiana. I loved when her family came to visit. Stephanie was very theatrical--she would write plays for all of us cousins to perform--and she was always talking about the books that she was reading. Hearing her read aloud would have been a natural combination of her aspirational literary enthusiasm.Grown-up Amy: Neil Gaiman. I was so excited when my best friend Mike told me I could listen to Gaiman read The Graveyard Book online. Gaiman has one of those reading voices that can make the nutritional content of cereal sound magical, and I'd love to hear him read aloud from some of my favorite books.Sentence #3: When I read aloud, my favorite character to impersonate is...10-year-old Amy: Sister Bear from the Berenstain Bears books. We had a lot of these books in my house growing up, and when I was ten, I would still read them with my 7-year-old brother.Grown-up Amy: the bear narrator from Jon Klassen's I Want My Hat Back. I love doing all of the voices in this book--a slow turtle, a confused what's-that-animal--but my favorite is the bear. I particularly like to say, in my best distraught bear voice, \"My poor hat. I miss it so much.\" It always gets some giggles from listeners.Sentence #4: The genre that takes up the most room on my bookshelf is...10-year-old Amy: Newbery Award books. My mother was always happy to buy books for my brother and me, and our school's book orders included great, inexpensive paperback copies of Newbery winners and honorees. I had a great selection.Grown-up Amy: Jane Austen books, both written by her and about her. I know, that's not really a children's librarian thing (although I do own the board book version of Pride and Prejudice!), but when all is said and done, Jane Austen books take up over 2 feet of bookshelf space in my apartment. I also own four different copies of Persuasion, my favorite Austen novel.Sentence #5: The last book I wish I'd written or inspired me to write my own story is...10-year-old Amy: The View from Saturday by E.L. Konigsburg. I was absolutely enchanted by how all of the characters and narratives were woven together, and I was inspired to write my own story, also set at a trivia competition, in the same style. My story was three pages, I think.Grown-up Amy: none. With all of the books that I've read, I have realized that creating stories is not a particular talent of mine. That's not a bad thing, and it doesn't make me sad at all. Instead, I am thrilled that I have a job that allows me to share the work of talented writers and storytellers with children.Do you ever reflect back on what your reading life was like at different times in your life?

It's equal parts funny and touching, and I love that I get to use my robot voice in read alouds.Story: You Will Be My Friend! by Peter Brown     Another great story about making a friend--and why it's important to be yourself, because you'll find friends who are perfectly compatable with you. We talked about the illustrations a lot during this reading, and we also talked about activities we like to do with our friends.Activity: Parachute time!     You can't use a big parachute by yourself--you need your friends to help you in order for it to be a lot of fun (see what I did there?). We worked together to make small ripples, rough waves, and, finally, a tent that we could sit inside. The kiddos loved the parachute so much that they asked to do it again after our craft. I obliged.Craft: \"My Best Friend\" drawing/writing activity     I love open-ended crafts, especially for programs where attendance can vary. This craft consisted of a white sheet of paper with the words \"My Best Friend\" and a picture of an empty picture frame; I asked the children to draw a picture of what they like to do with their best friends in the frame. One child drew himself and his friend pretending to be pirates; another drew a picture of himself and his friend on a treasure hunt. Not only does the open-endedness of these crafts facilitate writing--an early literacy practice--but it also provides opportunities for talking about what the children draw/write. That's both talking (another early literacy practice) and ascribing meaning to marks on a page. The big, bold letters at the top also provide perfect fodder for practicing letter recognition. For a rather simple paper-and-crayons craft, that's a lot of early literacy impact.My story time friends and their caregivers certainly seemed to enjoy themselves!"},

Yet whatever a child--nay, a person's--age or reading ability, I've found that people consider it a treat when someone reads aloud to them.What's so special about reading aloud?Reading aloud connects us all to our cultural ancestry, to a time before ebooks and the printing press and lay literacy, when the only way to tell stories was out loud. Technological developments in the book world haven't dented the human appreciation for stories, and listening to a book read aloud resonates with a fundamental need to connect with the world through words, imagination, and stories.Reading aloud allows us to rejoice in the rhythm and melodious sounds of words. There is such beauty in language, and I love to share that with others. I'll often read a sentence or passage aloud to my coworkers or the children in the library simply because of how beautiful it sounds.Reading aloud gives listeners shared experience. I love to share funny books aloud because group laughter is infectious and momentous. I regularly have classrooms of preschoolers talk to me excitedly about a book we shared months before, simply because the experience of sharing that book was a touchstone for them. I also often take my favorite picture books home for visits to read aloud for friends and family after dinner simply because shared stories are wonderful. Reading aloud together creates strong bonds.Reading aloud is comforting. One of my favorite summer programs is a Book Bunch Picnic Lunch series, where families bring sack lunches to the library and eat an indoor picnic while I read aloud. I love to see just how much older school-age children in particular enjoy listening to stories despite the fact they can read them on their own. Being read to feels safe and relaxing and luxurious.Reading aloud gives us mantras and meanings that enrich our lives. \"I think I can, I think I can!\" \"Let the wild rumpus start!\" We internalize the lines and stories that we hear and love; they stick with us. My mother and I can still recite the first several pages of Dr. Seuss's Sleep Book--that's how much we read it together and loved it. And while it may seem amusing that I know an intro to a Dr. Seuss book by heart as a 26-year-old, I would firmly argue my life is better for having bits of books inside my brain.What do you think is special about reading aloud?~~*~~This post is part of the World Read Aloud Day Blogging Challenge, which features weekly blog prompts leading up to World Read Aloud Day on March 6.

So keep this in mind: while it may seem as though I'm just offering you details of my low-tech, cut-and-paste-and-paint-and-stick Valentine Workshop, I'm really showing you how easy it is to turn your own youth program room into a maker space for an hour.Every year, I love to offer an informal program at which my library kiddos can make valentines. My valentine programs attract kids who like crafts; kids who want to give their friends and classmates something homemade, but lack supplies at home; and kids who just happen to be wandering around the library after school, looking for something to do. My preparation process is simple and straightforward:Pretty paper!hit the craft store a few days before the program (I picked up a ton of stick-on foam hearts, stars, and flowers, as well as some great patterned scrapbook paper, all very discounted);grab red and pink paper from our equipment room (a.k.a. my office) as well as anything else that might fit on a valentine (googly eyes!);set up tables and chairs in the program room with markers, paint daubers, scissors, and glue at each station;open the program room doors and let the creativity flow.I find a messy process oftenbegets lovely results.I had about 25 people come through this year's one-hour Valentine Workshop. Yes, that's smaller than my more \"programmed\" programs tend to be, but the smaller group size meant I was able to circulate the room and talk to every child about Valentine's Day, their creations, and what they've been reading. As I wandered about the room talking to the children, I also got a sneak peek into their processes. One girl was methodically making matching valentines for each of her classmates; another child was strategically placing stick-on foam stars amidst her poems for her friends; and a boy made valentines that doubled as bookmarks. The younger kids experimented with how much glue it takes to get a googly eye to stick (not as much as they think it takes), and then they left with at least one valentine for a family member or friend. The products of our hour were varied, and invariably the makers were proud of what they'd made.They always assume I'm married.When it comes down to it, maker spaces for kids are, in my experience, equal parts about the freedom to build and having a forum to share with others. That's the exact sort of environment I seek to create in my low-tech maker spaces: plenty of supplies for unrestrained creativity, space and time to make things, and companions who are interested in what they're doing. My kids really enjoy the opportunity to relax, get their hands dirty, and make things without rigid instructions. I even got my very own valentines at the end of it.How are you incorporating maker spaces into your youth programming? Have you given the maker movement much thought?"},

Over the next few weeks, I'll have a dozen troops of young Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts visit my branch for a story, tour, game, and library card. I've talked a bit about the types of scavenger hunt games we have in the library for tour visits such as these. But those scavenger hunts are the finale of the visit; I always start with a story. Some years I focus on storytelling and share a folktale; the oldest scouts in particular (think fifth or sixth grade) appreciate a somewhat scary tale. This scouting season, though, I'm primarily sharing Scaredy Squirrel by Melanie Watt and Here Come the Girl Scouts! by Shana Corey.Ordinarily I am opposed to using one book for a male audience and another for a female audience. This year's scout visits represent a rare deviation from my books-have-no-gender book sharing strategy, though. Why? Scaredy Squirrel is always prepared, and the Boy Scout motto is \"Be prepared\"; and Corey's non-fiction picture book tells the story of the formation of the Girl Scouts organization. Each book speaks to these specific audiences quite perfectly.Both of these books keep the scout audiences engaged, and I have had more than one den/troop leader ask me how I can keep the attention of a group of squirmy 8-year-olds for 45 minutes from start to finish. What can I say? A good story, the chance to explore a place filled with things to read, watch, and play, and a scavenger hunt around the library can do wonders for engaging kids.What do you do when scout groups visit your library? Do you lead more specific badge-earning activities, or is it mostly getting them acquainted with the library?"},
{"title": null, "date": "Friday, February 8, 2013", "text": "Have you seen Sarah Bean Thompson's Caldecott Storytimes series? When I saw her latest installment, I decided I had to focus on illustrations in my February outreach. Our local schools are in the midst of Caldecott and Newbery projects right now, so my supplies of Caldecott titles are low, but I grabbed a few other books with beautiful illustrations, all different from one another, and headed to the preschools. Here's how it went.Opening Song: \"Open, Shut Them\"Story: Chu's Day by Neil Gaiman, illustrated by Adam Rex     Before I began this first story, I introduced our theme for the day: looking closely at the pictures in books to get more from the story. Chu's Day is a shorter story text-wise, but Rex's illustrations add so many layers of richness. I invited children to shout out what they saw in the big picture spreads where Chu is at the library, the diner, and the circus. I included some leading questions to help them see how pictures can fill out details in a story. One example was in the diner spread, where I asked if they could tell who was the chef. We looked for the chef's hat and finally found the whale behind the diner counter. All these small details felt like new discoveries to the kids--discoveries that added to the story.Story: The Duckling Gets a Cookie!? by Mo Willems     I shared the cover of this book and asked the kiddos if the pictures looked as detailed as our previous story. Willems's relatively sparse style adds its own flair to his stories, especially the characters of Pigeon and Duckling. The kids love Pigeon's overdramatic responses to everything, and they particularly enjoyed looking at the spreads where Pigeon rattles on about all the things he's asked for but not gotten. And the black steam/rage cloud above Pigeon's head at one point? They loved that and commented on it.Wiggle Rhyme: \"Three Sailors Went to Sea\"     Even though I was inviting comments from kids throughout the first two stories, I could tell they were getting wiggly from sitting still. Thus I broke up our session with a wiggle rhyme that Ted from Your Magic Storytime Hat recently reminded me about. We did actions (making waves with our arms for \"sea\" and putting our hands above our eyes for \"see\") and repeated the rhyme several times, trying to get faster each time.Three Sailors Went to SeaThree sailors went to sea, sea, seaTo see what they could see, see, seeBut all that they could see, see, seeWas the bottom of the deep blue sea, sea, sea!Story: You Will Be My Friend! by Peter Brown     I think Brown's illustration style represented a great middle ground between Rex's rich detail and Willems's expressive minimalism. In this story, Lucy Bear is eager to make a new friend--but she has a rather hard time doing that, what with her distinct personality. One of the beauties of this book, in my opinion, is that the pictures are vital to getting the whole story. That fact invites plenty of talking about what readers/listeners can see in the pictures before I turn the page. My kids were really starting to enjoy talking about what they saw, and they fell into a rhythm of knowing when it was time to quiet down so I could turn the page.Story: Max Found Two Sticks by Brian Pinkney     For our last story, we talked about how things in the pictures can hint about what is going to happen next in a story. In this book, Max finds two twigs and decides to make music with them by drumming on all manner of objects. He finds the sticks while his grandfather is washing windows; in the next spread, we see Max drumming on the wash bucket. After his friends show up drinking sodas out of glass bottles, the next spread shows Max drumming on those bottles. By the end of the story, my kids were able to guess what Max would be drumming on next. I also really love sharing this story because it can be interactive--I ask kids to stick out their two pointer fingers to be their own sticks, and they can drum and tap along to the rhythms in the text. Lots of fun all around.Closing Song: \"If You're Happy and You Know It\"     I always worry that the kiddos are growing tired of ending our story times with this song, but that's not yet been the case. This time I pulled out the ukulele and asked the children to remember some of the animals we saw in our stories to fill the verses of the songs. My favorite was when they wanted to be pandas like Chu--they decided it was best to pretend to chomp on bamboo if you're happy and you know it and are being a panda.~~*~~What are some of your favorite books to share and talk about illustrations?"},

World Read Aloud Day is an event from the folks at LitWorld, and it is a global initiative to draw attention to the prevelance of illiteracy worldwide. Did you know that almost 10% of the world's inhabitants are unable to read? Last year, hundreds of thousands of people celebrated the joys of reading by participating in 65 countries all over the world. My library will be among the many, many sites celebrating literacy this year on March 6.I'm planning an all-day celebration of reading at my library to mark World Read Aloud Day. On the half hour of every hour that the library is open (9:30 a.m., 10:30 a.m., and so on through 8:30 p.m.), one of my colleagues or I will announce over the PA system that it is World Read Aloud Day. We'll invite anyone in the library who is interested to join us in Picture Book City, my library's children's area, for a read-aloud story to celebrate literacy. I'm choosing a wide variety of books for my twelve read-alouds: classics, new favorites, non-fiction, poetry, and award-winners will all be represented. We'll share one story every hour, and after the story is over, participants will hear a quick world literacy fact and be asked to write their names on colorful die-cut books. Each cardstock book will be displayed in the entryway of the library. My hope is that we'll have a rainbow of books with names on them in the library entryway to show just how much we support worldwide literacy.Are you interested in planning your own World Read Aloud Day event? Looking for some tips? Head over to the official website to download activities, an event kit, and the event badge. If you've got Skype capabilities in your facility, you may want to connect with authors and illustrators for your event; author Kate Messner is compiling a list of book folks who are interested in virtual visits to classrooms and libraries, and she'll have full info on her blog later this month. Don't forget to register your event on the LitWorld website, too.I hope you'll consider sharing the joys of reading and bringing awareness to global literacy by celebrating World Read Aloud Day on March 6!"},

{"title": null, "date": "Friday, February 1, 2013", "text": "Our themed projectiles.When I saw the Angry Birds Live! programs shared by the likes of Future Librarian Superhero, Bryce Don't Play, and Teen Library Toolbox, I knew I needed to add that program to my schedule of upcoming events. They made it sound so easy, so much fun! So I started saving book boxes and asked staff to bring in all manner of recyclables for building the towers, and the kids of a library employee offered to donate the use of their Angry Birds stuffed pillows for demolition duty during the event. I figured I would round out the projectiles with some of the tactile balls I use in baby programs, and we'd use our miscellaneous-print fabric to toss the birds at the towers. Simple enough.Haha. Oh, no.The building supplies.My Angry Birds! program took place on a day off of school--translation: no one had recess--that also happened to be a frigid day here in Missouri--translation: no one had left home or burned off any energy at all prior to coming to the library. We had a massive number of kids and their grownups come into the program room (final count was around 57 people), and they anxiously awaited the go-ahead from me to pick through the tables lined with building materials and get to knocking things down.I had the best of intentions of making the STEAM elements of this program explicit in my program introduction: I mentioned the engineering inherent in building towers, the science of projectiles, the creativity of making crazy structures. I had the kids' attention for maybe five minutes before their pent-up energy demanded they be allowed to construct and destroy.Our 45 minute program featured rapid cycles of tower-building and destruction. I initially encouraged the children to form small groups to create small towers; once they were satisfied with their towers, they worked together to project an Angry Bird at it to knock it down. I then encouraged them to pair with another group to try to build a larger, more structurally sound tower that wouldn't be knocked over by just one projectile. They happily obliged, building structures with solid foundations, but soon the cheers accompanying the destruction overshadowed most of my attempts to provide further guidance. They were having fun, though, so I didn't worry.Finally, with just eight minutes left in the program, I shouted out the final instructions: children would form a total of three teams, and each team would strive to build the tallest, strongest tower. Then we'd all watch the demolition efforts together. All three groups made massive towers that touched the ceiling tiles--parents put small children on their shoulders to get the final pieces atop the towers. I was impressed by the dedication to the challenge.The children gathered to watch the destruction of the first tall tower--then cheers. The children moved to the second tall tower to watch its fall--more cheers. But then...Mayhem followed.The only way I can think to explain the last moments of the program is to say that hive mind kicked in. Somehow, without any instruction from me and without any oblique communication, every child picked up a ball. Then every child aimed. Before I knew it, someone was counting down, and after that 3-2-1, every child threw his or her ball at the tall, tall tower, which immediately came crashing down.The next thing I saw was a room full of maniacally laughing children, pieces of recyclables scattered at their feet, holding bits of cardboard and styrofoam over their heads and tearing them to tiny pieces. Total chaos, yet total joy. So many smiles as families left. So much vacuuming after they were gone.So I would say, librarian friends, that in my experience an Angry Birds program is not for the faint of heart, especially in the winter. If you aim to offer one, look to those bloggers linked in the intro who seemed to have a calmer time of it. Yet all the mayhem of that evening was worth it, especially when a few kids stopped by the next day to say how much fun it was to build things at the library. It just goes to show that the things you build needn't be permanent for the enjoyment and informal learning to last."},

Librarians started gathering around the venue at 6:45 a.m., and by 8:00 a.m., when the announcements began, the energy in the room was positively buzzing. Then, when the winners were announced? Pure excitement and joy.I have to say that I am thrilled by the books that the 2013 committees recognized. Tons of outstanding non-fiction made the list, and the fact that there are so many honor books in many categories accurately reflect what I think was a year filled to the brim with wonderful books for youth. I am excited to be able to say that I have shared many of the Caldecott and Geisel winners and honorees with my outreach groups--and to their great enjoyment. The winners most definitely reflect what books children love.The two biggest awards--the Newbery and the Caldecott, as I'm sure you know--went to two books that are, in my opinion, distinguished in every way: The One and Only Ivan by Katherine Applegate, and This Is Not My Hat by Jon Klassen. My, do those books look wonderful with those shiny stickers on their covers! I am happy to have left Seattle knowing that these are now books that young readers will have access to for years and years to come.

{"title": null, "date": "Wednesday, January 23, 2013", "text": "Two weeks ago, I asked a question of those of you who create library programs: When it comes to library programs, what is your planning style? I ended up with 49 responses to that question, and I find the results of this (admittedly small sample size) poll interesting. Without further ado, the breakdown of how you all plan your programs:The most popular program planning style (in orange), which is standard for over half of us, is to plan a general theme in advance of the program and fill in the details in the last few days before it happens. This method is primarily how I program, as I mentioned in my initial post. I personally like that there are so many fantastic ideas out there in libraryland that my colleagues are willing to share, and when I find something I like, I make note of it (and of my source!); I feel very comfortable filling in the fine print of the program--or the less fine print, if I'm unprogramming--closer to the actual event. I find this strategy especially useful since sometimes my expected program attendance can vary wildly. No use planning a huge program for what looks, in the few days leading up to the program, to be a group of five. It seems many of you agree, albeit I'm sure your reasons may differ from mine. Share details of your reasoning in the comments!The next most popular program planning styles are having a loose plan and going with the audience's mood (in green) and meticulously planning a program at least a week in advance (in red). I'm curious to know what sorts of programs these respondents are offering. Loose planners, what do your programs look like, and what do your attendees think of them? Meticulous planners, what are your motivations for planning ahead? Preparedness, staff or budget control, centralized planning? I'd love to know if you're inclined to share in the comments.Only two of you said that you totally wing it when it comes to programming (in blue), and three of you clarified your programming planning style with other responses (in purple). One of those \"Others\" plans every detail over a month ahead of time, and the other two admit to using different planning styles for different types of programs. Which brings up a good point--are some programs \"quicker\" to plan than others? Relative ease could stem from substantial experience offering a type of program--story times, for instance--or from a number of other factors. Have you found that you can put together certain types of programs more quickly, efficiently, and effectively than others which require more brainpower? How do your program offerings break down along these lines? I know that I personally need to do at least a bit of deliberate planning for each of my programs, although my STEAM programs do take a bit more concentration and intention than my story times. How does it work out for you?And, last but not least, what does this all mean? I find it encouraging that the vast majority of you have some sort of plan in place when you walk into a program room full of kids. That fact gives some validation to my own methods--in particular sharing program ideas with colleagues. I primarily use blogs, conferences, Twitter conversations, and other collaborative/interactive spaces to get ideas, and that's what I try to do here, too. Knowing that you all, to varying extents, use plans in your programming, too, makes me even more inclined to share as much of my programming on this blog (and the ALSC blog) as I can.The last thing I want to say is that I am thrilled to see so many youth services librarians putting any level of thought and deliberation into programming, and I cannot wait for opportunities to talk programs with all of you.

Here's this week's review:TinkerBox App ReviewApp: TinkerBox from AutodeskPlatforms: iPad, iPhone/iPodContent Area: Physics, EngineeringAge Recommendation: 7+Premise: A brief tutorial introduces new users to the array of simple machines and tools (springs, conveyor belts, scissors, buttons, and blocks, to name a few) that are used throughout the app's two modes of play: Puzzle and Invent. In Puzzle mode, players are given a task to complete--for example, to get a ball in a bucket. Each level begins with a number of tools and machines in place; it is up to the player to determine how to use the additional pieces in the supplies bar in order to complete each level's task. There is some flexibility as to how each level can be solved, which keeps some of the more difficult levels from getting too frustrating. Players are able to test their creations as many times as they need to in order to tinker with their set-ups and solve a level. In Invent mode, players have access to all of the game's machines and tools and are free to create any sort of contraption. Inventors can save their creations, and there is also an e-mail option for when the device is connected to the internet.     The TinkerBox app is well laid-out with clear HD graphics, which helps players to streamline their puzzle-solving process. All machines and tools are easily manipulable, perfect for users who are not yet completely comfortable with a touchscreen interface. The app also includes two levels of sound that can be switched off: background music and SFX (which gives sound to the machines and tools in action). This app does a great job of introducing the physics of a number of simple machines and tools in a fun, non-competitive context. I can easily see engineering-minded children getting really into the gameplay.Potential Library Uses:  - Recommending in reference interviews  - On library-owned devices for customer useLite Version Available?: No, but the app is free~~*~~See my first app review post for links to additional app review sources.

I was instantly enamored of the information Schiavi shared with us, and I knew that I would have to get a preschool dance party on my program calendar.This week marked the first such program at my branch, and it was a HIT. I got to work in a few early literacy messages along with the fun, too: I reminded caregivers that establishing an internal rhythm helps prepare children for the cadence of reading, and I mentioned the increased exposure to word sounds and vocabulary offered by songs. Bonus: many of the library's best children's music CDs were checked out after the program, signaling continued musical fun at home for these kids. This really is a home run of a program; I hope you'll steal my playlist and offer the program at your library. (You can even take advantage of the music's funky nature and tie it into summer reading--can you dig it?!?)Preschool Dance PartySong: \"Dance, Dance, Dance\" by The Beach Boys     We warmed up to this song, doing lots of stretches and simple movements in time to the music to get ready for the rest of the program. All shyness had dissipated by its end.Song: \"I Like to Swim\" by The Kerplunks     We did the motions in the song, which include swimming front stroke, backstroke, and butterfly. We also laid down on the floor when the lyrics talked about floating in the water.Song: \"Come On, Get Happy\" by Daddy A Go-Go     I passed out rhythm sticks for this tune. We tapped the sticks above our heads, behind our backs, and using the floor as drums.Song: \"We Are the Dinosaurs\" by Laurie Berkner     What kid wouldn't want to march-stomp around the room pretending to be a dinosaur? The song ends with a fabulous RRRRROOOOAAAAAAARRRRR!Song: \"The Shaker Hop\" by Carole Peterson     I passed out egg shakers for this tune, which includes a good balance of motion lyrics (putting shakers in and out) and free shaking time.Story Break: The Man from the Land of Fandango by Margaret Mahy and Polly Dunbar     Before kids settled onto the story time rug for our story, I handed out small cups of pretzels and glasses of water. After jumping around for almost 15 minutes straight, they were ready for a bit of rest, hydration, and energy boost. This book is the perfect length for a story interlude, and its rhythmic language and dance theme made it an easy choice to include in this program.Song: \"Clap Your Hands\" by They Might Be Giants     This song boasts a mere three different lines of lyrics: 1) Clap your hands! 2) Stomp your feet! 3) Jump in the air! Children happily oblige.Song: \"Barnyard Boogie\" by Greg & Steve     I brought out our 12-handled parachute for this one. With an older crowd, you could get the children to do specific actions with the lyrics. My younger group was so excited by the parachute, though, that we just made waves.Song: \"I Really Love to Dance\" by Laurie Berkner     I asked the grownups in the room to take the handles of the parachute for this one, giving the kiddos a chance to dance underneath the parachute. We finished the song--and the program--by letting the parachute fall over everyones' heads like a tent. Happy squealing ensued.~~*~~What are your favorite songs to share with preschoolers?"},

Andrew is a \"doodle boy\"; he loves to draw. The simple story is told with few words and intriguing illustrations, which are moved along with the help of flaps on the pages. I love talking about the illustrations with children; it is so much fun to watch them observe how Andrew's single line can transform into something magnificent.Story: Pass it On! by Marilyn Sadler, illus. by Michael Slack     This silly story takes place over the course of an inadvertent game of telephone: a bee seeks to get help for a cow stuck in a fence, but his message gets twisted into all sorts of humorous statements along the way. By the time animals make their way back to said cow stuck in said fence, they are all expecting different things: a tent, a woodchuck, a penny, milk and honey. Kids love the goofiness of the message getting lost in translation.Song: \"Apples and Bananas\"     Have you ever tried sharing this song with kids? They love the silly words that result from changing the vowels in the lyrics. We focused on long As, long Os, and long Us. We like to oot, oot, oot, ooples and banoonoos... (If you play this song on a ukulele like me, you need only two chords: C for the first line, G for the second.)Story: Oh, No! by Candace Fleming, illus. by Eric Rohmann     This beautifully-illustrated book has a chant-like rhythm to it that makes it a joy to share. A number of lesser-known animals get stuck in a tiger's hole--a loris, a sunbear--and just when the tiger is about to eat his catch... BA-BOOM! Rescue.

I love the tips and tricks, the program idea sharing, the camaraderie that shows any time the media misunderstands (again) libraries. I love hearing about new books and reading what fellow librarians are thinking about them. Perhaps what I love most, however, are the meaningful conversations that pop up around timely topics. Blogs are a great way to see what sorts of things are on the minds of librarians at any given time. Here are the three topics that have been on mine thanks to some great posts:Programming     I was one of the many librarians to forward an article including a library program on pig-butchering to my coworkers. I also linked my branchmates to a follow-up article from The Atlantic Wire that further explores the untraditional realms of programming to which libraries are now offering access. I love that articles like these help us to think about what it means to program in a contemporary library. What do our communities want and/or need from a third space like a library? The particular answers may seem crazy at first, but so do a lot of really cool things.Unprogramming     That was programming. But what about what Marge Loch-Wouters of Tiny Tips for Library Fun has dubbed \"unprogramming\"? I love the sort of questions that the idea of unprogramming your programs makes you ask. For example: Is what the attendees get out of the program worth the amount of time I put into planning the program? How do our programs tie back to the library's mission, values, and/or resources? Is it time to retire/revamp old or traditional programs that have become tired? Basically, is what we offer worth it for our customers? I'm thinking of coming up with a list of such questions to ask myself and my staff before we commit to future schedules of programs--we want to make sure that we're intentionally offering what's best for the community and what makes sense in terms of resource use.App Reviews     Cen Campbell at Little eLit has been blogging this year about what librarians should consider when they review apps. She gives a thorough reasoning behind the importance of a variety of criteria: age appropriateness; in-app controls; interactivity; affordances; early literacy support; annoyance factors and customization; and intended use. I am finding these posts incredibly thought-provoking as I tweak my own plan for how to incorporate apps into my library space. Cen also shares great examples of the criteria she discusses, and I'm happy to have a list of apps to try after reading her posts.~~*~~Those are three big topics that seem to be on my mind lately as well as on the minds of my colleagues. As programs kick back into high gear now, I will make a concerted effort to still give these topics as much consideration as I can in order to determine how they can inform what we do at my library.What library topics have you been ruminating on lately?"},
{"title": null, "date": "Wednesday, January 9, 2013", "text": "Library folks have been talking about taking programming breaks lately, and all that talk has got me thinking about program planning--I try to plan in bulk on breaks. You see, in my library district, program event calendars are published every quarter, with event descriptions ready at least a month before the first program. That means my March-May events must be solidified February 1. This schedule requires some amount of forethought and planning, which I create in the form of a programming grid:I have a rough idea of how many types of \"special\" programs (i.e., not recurring, age-specific story times) I want our department to offer every month. As I find ideas in the books I read, professional journals, and (primarily) online, I fill in the program spaces in my grid. As you can see, in some areas I am much better planned than others. I don't have my January outreach story time figured out yet, for example, despite the fact that it is most definitely already January. But I do have science program topics planned out for many months to come.My programming grid helps me keep tabs on all of the program ideas that end up bouncing around my brain, and it absolutely streamlines my process when I need to plug programs into a schedule. As far as planning program content, though? How I do that can vary hugely, and many times it takes the form of what Marge at Tiny Tips for Library Fun calls \"unprogramming.\" Here are three examples of my different programming styles:For school-age programs (that are not science programs): I tend to find inspiration for these programs in the form of complete ideas; that is, I find the theme, activities, and related books all at once. Thus, when I have a school-age program idea, I plug it into my program grid and create a Google Doc with the full program itinerary. Said itinerary can be structured (e.g., booktalk, craft, activity, craft, closing activity), but just as often the itinerary lists a few loose ideas of things we can do depending on audience mood. Regardless of whether I program or unprogram these events, I spend about 45 minutes planning for an average 45 minute program.For science programs: I spend downtime on the reference desk browsing science activities online, and when I find at least three on any given STEM topic, I consider that topic program-worthy. I plug the topic into my program grid, create a Google Doc with the program topic as the title, and wait until about two weeks before the program to solidify my program itinerary and create program materials. For these programs, I spend about 90 minutes for an average 45 minute program.For story times: With the exception of in the fall, when I incorporate state award-nominated picture books into my story times, I tend to keep a free planning style for story times. I like to look through new picture books as they are delivered to the branch, and I often find myself pulling these titles to share at upcoming story times. I'll frequently fill out these program reading lists with books from favorite authors, folktales, and classic picture books. I note relevant early literacy connection as I read through the books, and that's enough for me to be prepared to share tips in the program. Oh yes, and the craft. More and more often, I turn to so-called \"blank page crafts\" for my story times with a craft component. The freedom and creativity allowed by such crafts with loose parameters are developmentally beneficial to children, and I love the interactions I have with them when they tell me about their creations. That works for me. I usually spend between 15 and 30 minutes planning for 30-45 minute story times.So that's what I do when it comes to program planning. Even within my variety of programs, there are a range of program planning styles that I use. In my opinion, there is no one right way to plan programs--so long as the resulting programs are engaging, quality, and supporting some aspect of the library's mission, like literacy, education, lifelong learning, etc. (I will say, however, that when you spend 3, 4, 5 times as much time planning as you do providing a program, it's time to start evaluating program content priorities--more on that in a future post).What about you? How to do plan for your library programs? Take a moment and answer that question below; I'll share results in an upcoming blog post.Loading..."},

The NSF curates all of the content, which it gets from scientists, academic institutions, and science centers. All content is accompanied by a date, brief description, and citation, and I would have no qualms about using the content in reference requests for science reports. The app provides users lists of related videos based on what the user is watching, making the app engaging to browse casually. Content is also tagged with topic terms, and the tag index is searchable. The NSF frequently updates content, so information in the app relates to recent and groundbreaking science work. There is also a news feature where users can quickly access this newest content in the app.     The interface of the app is very clean and easy to use. Content is shown as thumbnails on what appears to be the inside of a sphere (with the user inside, able to navigate the whole surface, in a manner that reminded me of Cerebro from X-Men), and simple finger movements allow navigation through the thumbnails and between content. Users are also able to save favorite items and e-mail content/post content to Twitter/Facebook; these features cannot be turned off, which may affect how some libraries choose to use the app in their facilities.Potential Library Uses:  - Recommending in reference interviews  - On library-owned devices for customer use (headphones may be preferred for videos)  - In programs to share videos relating to STEM topicsLite Version Available?: No, but the app is free~~*~~See my earlier app review post for links to additional app review sources.

I've decided not to formally review any titles for the duration of my committee work--that is, if it's published in 2013, you won't see a review from me. I am a librarian, though, so I'll most definitely still be talking about books on this blog, albeit in a slightly different context than I have previously. What I read so often influences what I program for the kids at my library, and since I blog about my programs, titles and synopses of 2013 books related to my programming will necessarily enter the conversation. I want to take a moment to emphasize that any mention I make of 2013 titles on this blog reflects my personal thoughts, and mine alone; I could never dream of speaking for the intelligent, erudite people with whom I am serving on the committee, and I most definitely do not speak for the committee as a whole.Really, that's what I wanted to say.

If you're looking for something to read in the few weeks before the 2013 Youth Media Awards are announced, try starting here!Favorite non-fiction I read in 2012:House of Stone by Anthony Shadid     I actually listened to this audiobook and reviewed it for Library Journal; I found Shadid's ability to blend his home renovation struggles in Lebanon, his own family history, and the cultural history of this area of the Middle East captivating.Favorite adult fiction I read in 2012:Prepare to Die! by Paul Tobin     I enjoyed the grittiness of this non-traditional superhero story far more than I would have anticipated. The book follows Steve Clarke, also known as Reaver, during the two weeks his arch-nemesis has given him between his defeat and his death. The book prompted some great discussions of superheroes in our culture in general.The Age of Miracles by Karen Thompson Walker     I was completely taken by surprise by the beauty and melancholy of this novel. The story follows Julia, a middle school girl in California, in the first year of the Slowing--when the earth's rotation inexplicably begins to slow and to affect all life on the planet. My book club had a terrific discussion of this book, and I'd recommend it for book clubs in 2013.Favorite YA fiction I read in 2012:Where Things Come Back by John Corey Whaley     It's no secret that I fell in love with this book this year. I still don't feel I have words to adequately describe just how masterfully Whaley can weave together seemingly disconnected and odd storylines into a single story that is profoundly moving. This is a quiet book for sure, and it deserves your attention.The Raven Boys by Maggie Stiefvater     I read an ARC of this story after picking it up at ALA in June, and I've been listening to the audiobook again--that's how much I enjoy the story. It's kind of coming-of-age, kind of paranormal, kind of realistic, kind of boarding school... Really, it defies easy classification. Give it a try.Favorite children's fiction I read in 2012:Three Times Lucky by Sheila Turnage     I was enchanted by the rich setting and characters in this mystery story. The small town of Tupelo Landing is a quaint, quirky sort of Neverland--minus the murder, that is--and the narrator, Mo, is a wonderfully drawn young girl with spunk, imagination, and an energy that makes her jump out of the page and into your brain. This book was a pleasure to read.Ivy + Bean Make the Rules by Annie Barrows     I got on something of an Ivy + Bean kick this year. What can I say? I love those characters! Their personalities capture so well what it is to be children, and their friendship is a great model for children of all ages. I shared the Ivy + Bean series with many, many library customers this year, and they've all thanked me for it.~~*~~What were your favorite reads of 2012?What are you most looking forward to reading in 2013?"},

Visit the page for some ideas, then set a goal of integrating STEAM into your programming calendar.

Maybe it means you offer a full-blown STEAM program once a quarter, or once a month. Set a goal to STEAM in 2013.Offering STEAM programming at your library doesn't need to be a difficult thing. Worried because you weren't that great at science/math/etc. in high school? No problem! Offering STEAM programs for children doesn't require in-depth subject knowledge. All it requires is a bit of curiosity, a few supplies, and a willingness to ask questions and experiment in a group program setting. You can STEAM with Legos; you can STEAM with baking-soda-and-vinegar volcanoes; you can STEAM with building gingerbread houses. You can add a STEAM aspect to just about every program you offer to your customers, and your kiddos will be all the better for it.How will you STEAM in 2013?"},

My branch strives to keep a display of the Caldecott and Newbery winning titles for easy browsing, and every year we add pristine new copies of the most recent winners to our collection. These new copies are great, but some of the older winners? Frightful! Take a look:New copies on the left, old on the right.So many of our older Caldecott titles are permabound copies. Yes, they've stayed firmly together since the 1970s. But they've also become dirty as all get-out. I recently went on a replacement-purchasing binge so that the cover artwork of these books with award-winning illustrations is a positive representation of the beauty inside.Then there are the Newbery winners. Have you looked at your Newbery books lately? Please tell me: what do the covers look like? Do any look as dated and culturally confusing as our copy of the 1951 winner Amos Fortune, Free Man?New copy, old copy.Do any boast awkwardly-illustrated dogs that make readers think it's a book about a dog rather than an epic fantasy story, like our copy of 1976 winner The Grey King?New copy, old copy.How about a cover that is completely blank, like our copy of 1921 winner Smoky the Cowhorse? Yikes!New copy, infinitely worse old, blank copy.As a librarian, I have no idealized notions about how readers choose books. They absolutely judge books by their covers; everyone does it, especially kids. And these covers dissuade readers from ever giving these titles a chance. Say what you want about the books that have won awards, but they did win their honors for a reason. Yet very few children will electively pick up one of these books with disgusting, ridiculously dated, or blank covers. I'm hoping that our updated replacement copies will boost interest--or at the very least, shelf appeal--for the titles that have won some of children's literature's biggest awards.Fun link: Travis Jonker at 100 Scope Notes has been recovering the Newbery winners, creating updated covers for each of the books that have won the award since 1922.

{"title": null, "date": "Friday, December 21, 2012", "text": "We all know how much I enjoy adding STEM aspects to my craft programs--to offer STEAM programs for the children who visit my library. This week we were able to offer a five-hour drop-in Gingerbread House Workshop for the kiddos. It was flexible, so families with varying schedules could attend as it suited them; it was festive and helped to celebrate the holiday season; and it was, at its core, both an engineering and an art activity.Remember how I mentioned rinsing out all those milk cartons the other day? Those milk cartons served as the framework for the children's gingerbread houses. A colleague and I created plates with all the major building materials: milk carton frame, graham cracker bricks, and embellishments in the form of Necco wafers, candy corn, pretzels, peppermints, mini marshmallows, and licorice bites. These items were ready for gingerbread house assembly on all of our six covered tables. The construction glue--white icing--was set out on every table within easy reach. All these supplies may sound expensive, but the program ended up coming in at $0.74 per participant.This program worked remarkably well for a few reasons. First of all, because we had the program room open for five hours, we never had an overwhelming crowd--people came as it fit their schedules. Thus each child was able to get individual attention and praise from a library staff member while they constructing a gingerbread house. We were even able to have some great book chats during our slower stretches. Our final attendance count was 112; a high number for our program room, to be sure, but when spread out over five hours, very manageable.The program also worked well because children could succeed in making their creations regardless of their overall skill levels. We had fifth and sixth graders taking their time to make intricate houses, and we had two-year-olds focusing quite hard to wield the icing knives properly. Children at all ability levels were able to make their very own gingerbread houses, a point of pride.Additionally, this program is a great example of a basic STEAM program--the engineering and art aspects blend wonderfully. Children engaged their minds to figure out how to construct stable structures (the STEM side), and then they were able to add the sweet and savory embellishments to serve whatever purposes they chose (the creative, art-y side). Both sides of the brain were engaged in creating these gingerbread houses, and all the children were really cognizant of was how much fun they were having.Clean-up was very easy for this program, especially considering its overall stickiness and the large scale. We wrapped all our leftover materials in our disposable tablecloths at the end of the five hours, and after throwing them away, all we had left was a bit of vacuuming crumbs off the floor. We did have wet wipes and paper towels in the program--after all, as every children's librarian knows, if the potential for stickiness exists, at least 95% of the children will become sticky by activity's end. A little bit of sticky was a small price to pay for such an engaging, enjoyable program.Do you create and decorate gingerbread houses at your library? Had you ever thought of the program as a STEAM program?"},

I love getting a glimpse into the workdays of other children's librarians, and I enjoyed clicking through on the links she shared to see what my peers are up to. I figure it's about time I share a new Day in the Life, too; here's what I did on a recent Monday.8:20 a.m. - Arrive at the branch and look over the program schedule for the day.8:30 a.m. - Get our circulation and reference desk money drawers set up and count the money from yesterday's fines and fees. Lots of people want to start the new year with clean slates, and it seems we've been getting more fines paid off than usual.8:50 a.m. - Ten Minute Meeting with the opening staff. My branch manager instituted these brief daily meetings after our recent staff development day; they're a great, informal way to bring everyone up to speed on what to expect for the day, what programs to talk about with patrons, etc. We rotate who leads the meeting and who writes what we discuss on a giant sticky note in the staff room. Staff who aren't present at the morning meeting initial that they've read the notes when they start their shifts. Communication about all aspects of the branch has improved--messages don't get lost or garbled between shift changes anymore!9:00 a.m. - Open the branch, then meet with my branch manager to go over what's been happening since we last worked together.9:15 a.m. - Head to my desk to check my e-mail and gather things for my outreach story time visits. This includes reading over the books I'll be sharing and reviewing the chords I'll need for songs on my ukulele.9:45 a.m - Head out for Preschool Outreach Story Time!10:45 a.m. - Back at the branch, I head to the sink in the staff room to rinse out 100 milk cartons. A local elementary school saved them for us to use in an upcoming craft program (more on that later this week...), and even though the extremely kind lunch ladies had rinsed them at the school, they were getting a bit stinky. Aside: no one in library school ever mentioned I might find myself rinsing out dozens of milk cartons.11:30 a.m. - The director of the library district called to chat about a proposal I'm working on, so I spent some time on the phone with him and then filled my branch manager in on the proposal's progress.12:15 p.m. - Lunch.12:45 p.m. - More preschool outreach!1:45 p.m. - I hurry back into the branch to print off some agendas for a two o'clock meeting. I also get updated on what I've missed while I was out of the branch.2:00 p.m. - Early Literacy Task Force meeting. We talk about potential early literacy idea-sharing workshops for staff and assess the success of our recent early literacy initiatives. We agree on what we'll report to our colleagues at the upcoming children's meeting.3:10 p.m. - Work the reference desk. In between reference questions from customers, I'm able to put the finishing touches on an eReader flow chart for reference staff; we anticipate an increase in eReader questions after the holidays, and the flow chart is to help staff keep the devices and their specific set-up steps straight. I also finish formal letters to our teen volunteers informing them of scheduling changes in 2013.5:10 p.m. - Head home after a busy start to the week."},

Attendance at these evening programs has been spotty at best, so I tried something new this quarter: advertising the program theme on our events website and in our quarterly program guide. That means I needed to select my program themes several months in advance--something I don't normally do. We had a decent turn-out for our recent hibernation-themed story time. Here's what we did:Time to Hibernate! Story TimeOpening Song: \"Open, Shut Them\"Talk: We spent a few minutes learning what it means to hibernate; several kiddos chimed in with what they knew about hibernation. We also practiced saying the word: \"Let me hear you say 'hibernate.'\"Story: Old Bear by Kevin Henkes     This beautifully illustrated book has simple, brief text and invites plenty of opportunity for dialogic reading. On every season's spread, we talked about what we could see in pictures and what we remember seeing in those seasons here in Missouri.Song: \"Where is Brown Bear?\"     I used stick puppets with images of a brown bear, a groundhog, and a chipmunk to add a visual to this song (see photo above). The children really loved it--they especially enjoyed seeing the animals go to sleep, which I mimed by setting the puppets on the floor. \"Where is Brown Bear?\"(tune: \"Where is Thumbkin?\")Where is brown bear*?Where is brown bear*?Here I am!Here I am!How are you this winter?Very tired, thank you.Go to sleep.Go to sleep. *can be repeated with different hibernating animals Story: Hibernation by Margaret Hall     This non-fiction title introduces young children to the concept of hibernation. It talks about different animals that hibernate and why; how they get ready; and how they find places to spend the winter months. The children were fascinated to see all the different animals that hibernate; they knew about bears and groundhogs, but the bats and frogs took them by surprise. The big photos are great for sharing. Matching Game: Colored Bears     I spread out lots of different colored bears on the story time carpet and, one color at a time, I encouraged the children to take the bears to our felt board cave to hibernate. It just so happened that my story time audience was pretty knowledgeable and confident regarding their colors, but they still enjoyed the interactive aspect. Craft: Making hibernation caves     Each child received a white die-cut bear and a blank white sheet of paper. Bears could be decorated however they wanted, and the white sheet of paper was the bear's cave; I encouraged the kiddos to draw the things their bears might want when they wake up in the caves. I saw berries to eat, a radio to listen to, leaves for a bed, and plenty of other great, creative ideas. The last step of the craft was to staple a black sheet of paper over the cave, thus closing the cave door until spring. One child asked his mother if he could hang his cave on his bedroom wall so it was ready for him to open in the spring. Adorable!﻿"},

I just want to suggest a really great, totally free gift idea for the kids in your life.This holiday season, give the gift of story time.Sharing stories is one of life's great pleasures. Reading together helps build strong, positive relationships; it also allows sharers to bond over the stories they read together, whether the stories are funny, sad, touching, scary, or full of adventure. What we share with others becomes a part of our common experience, a touchstone for our future interactions with one another. Stories help us to find our best friends.Sharing stories is also one of the best things you can do to help prepare a child to succeed in life. Children who are read to frequently and with love are usually better readers and better overall students than those who don't have stories shared with them regularly. Children who experience stories have higher vocabularies and better general understanding about the world; they are often more imaginative than children who did not hear stories, and they are better able to weave their own lives into narrative format, too. Who wouldn't want to give a gift with that sort of lifelong impact?So this holiday season, grab a few of your favorite books from the library or a bookstore (indie if you can). Sit down to share those books with the children in your life, and plan to spend at least 20 minutes reading together. Go ahead, you can even be indulgent and make this story time a habit. Add songs and rhymes, finger plays and puppets, even silly voices; anything that helps stories jump off the page and into the memory and the heart.Story time is a gift that can make a big difference--both for the child you read to and for you. Consider giving the gift of story time this year."},

He's just woken up from a nice, long, hibernation nap, and all he wants is a hug. Getting that hug seems to be rather difficult, though, as he can't seem to find the perfect hugger. He tries a boulder, a tree, a shrub, and a rather displeased owl before finally finding the person who gives perfect hugs.Story: Pete the Cat Saves Christmas by Eric Litwin     Pete is a perenially favorite among my outreach story time crowds, and since all the centers I visit confirmed that they do celebrate Christmas, I opted to share this fun holiday story with my groups. Ever wonder what would happen should Santa be unable to handle Christmas? Never fear--Pete the Cat is here, and he's got a song to help him bring joy to all the little girls and boys!Voting: With the help of the teachers at the child care centers I visit, all of the children get the chance to vote for their favorie of the ten Building Block Picture Book Award nominees that we shared over the course of the fall. I have the cover of each book printed on a sheet of paper; voting for a particular book means going to stand by that picture (this is the only way I've found to keep the kids from voting for more than one title--they can only physically be in one place, so the vote by proximity). I tally the votes and say I'll report back with the big winner in January.Song: \"Jingle Bells\"     I had a child request last month that I learn \"Jingle Bells\" on my ukulele, and that's what I did. There's nothing like finishing off a story time with a favorite tune to which everyone knows the words."},

{"title": null, "date": "Monday, December 10, 2012", "text": "When I hosted my first Stuffed Animal Sleepover and Story Time last spring, I didn't know what type of response to expect. Would families find it too logistically difficult to visit the library in the evening and then again the next morning? Would young children be traumatized at the prospect of leaving a beloved stuffed animal at the library overnight? My concerns, as it turned out, were unfounded; plenty of families loved the idea of the stuffed animal sleepover. They loved it so much that we recently offered another.The basic format for our most recent Stuffed Animal Sleepover and Story Time was very similar to our spring program. Caregivers brought their children to the library on a Wednesday evening with their stuffed animal friends in tow. As each child brought his or her stuffed friend to the reference desk, I asked for a few details: the stuffed animal's name; the child's name, for the back of each animal's nametage; and any special instructions for taking care of the animal. I learned which stuffed friends needed help brushing their teeth, which enjoyed dancing before bedtime, and which needed a hug before being tucked in. Adorable. (And pro-early literacy! Those kids were all about talking about bedtime rituals!)A teen volunteer was at the library that Wednesday night to help photograph the stuffed animals doing library sleepover activities--ordering pizza for dinner, playing at the train set, having story time... Having a volunteer on hand to assist with the photos was a HUGE help. Whereas during the last go-round I felt frantic on the evening of the drop-off, this time I was able to get things done at a reasonable clip. I had all of the photos taken on my iPad for easy creation of a slideshow for our story time the next morning; everything felt much more seamless this time around.On Thursday morning, I woke up the animals and got set up for our story time. The formal program included four main components:1. Viewing the slideshow of the animals' sleepover antics. Kids and caregivers both love this portion of the program--I had a couple of moms snapping pictures of the projected slideshow before I mentioned I would share the link with them. I used the Haiku Deck app to make this simple slideshow.2. Sharing a few stories and songs. I read some books that the stuffed animals had \"read\" the night before: Maisy Goes on a Sleepover by Lucy Cousins; Let's Sing a Lullaby with the Brave Cowboy by Jan Thomas; and Waking Dragons by Jane Yolen. We sang a few songs while I played the ukuklele; the favorite was \"If All the Raindrops.\"3. Enjoying a small breakfast-y snack. I had juice boxes and mini doughnuts set out on a table for everyone. Tests indicate that powdered sugar trumps chocolate, FYI.4. Getting crafty to create sleepover souvenirs. I printed out a picture of each of the stuffed animals friends doing something at the library. Children were able to cut out that picture and then attach it to a cardboard picture frame that they had decorated. Caregivers particularly love these keepsakes. Each child could also draw and/or write on a small poster to show what their stuffed animal's favorite part of the sleepover was. Funny moment: When I asked one child what her dog Clifford said was his favorite part of the night, she replied, deadpan: \"You do know they can't talk, right?\"Children were able to finish their crafts at their own pace before heading home with their stuffed animals. I did share the slideshow with all the caregivers who shared their e-mail addresses, and I got a lot of positive feedback after I sent that message. Already I've heard from families asking when we'll offer the program again--some really enjoyed it, and some weren't able to attend this time. I think it's safe to say we'll be giving this program a permanent spot in our special programs rotation.Questions? Recommendations? Stories about your own stuffed animal sleepoevers?

{"title": null, "date": "Friday, December 7, 2012", "text": "I've talked before about using teen volunteers to support our annual summer reading program. Now, for a bit of a change, let's talk about using teen volunteers during the academic year. Because that whole shebang is a horse of a different color.When I started my position at my branch in August 2011, I took on the responsibilities of the volunteer coordinator as well as the children's librarian. That fall, I had a volunteer corps of about 7 teens, totaling an average of 10 hours of help each week. Fast forward to today, when I have a group of 11 volunteers putting in 17 hours each week. That's seventeen hours each week when volunteers show up at my library in order to help us get things done. They come to me looking for their tasks. And I increasingly don't have much for them to do.You see, in our library, volunteers help with small tasks that are not at the core of any staff person's job description. Our regular volunteers do any and all of the following:Alphabetize carts of returned itemsPrepare items reserved by customers to go on our reserve shelvesPrepare craft components for programsWithdraw items that have been weeded by staffCut scrap paperHelp set up the program room for eventsPull items on lists prepared by staffCheck in books that were recently used in programsStock materials displaysAssist with special one-time projects as directedNow let me ask you a question: would your library (considering it is medium-sized like mine with an average of 5 programs per week) have seventeen hours worth of these tasks each and every week? I think you can start to see my problem: I have lots of volunteers, and not enough tasks to keep them all occupied.That's why I'm reorganizing how we work with our teen volunteers. We're shutting down volunteer operations for the weeks of Christmas and New Year's. Then, when volunteers start to come around again the second week of January, a new schedule will kick into place. Volunteers will have one shift every other week instead of weekly. Ta-da!I know that modification doesn't seem huge, but it will cut in half our weekly job of frantically organizing volunteer tasks. The demands on staff will be fewer as we have reduced weekly volunteer traffic. Also, by reducing the ratio of volunteer hours to volunteer tasks, we'll be able to give each of our volunteers more substantial and meaningful work. Whereas under our current schedule the weekly Friday afternoon volunteer always gets stuck helping us wrap our reserves, in the new schedule she'll get more variety in her assignments. It's a win-win for everyone.Or at least I hope. I'm interested to hear what volunteers have to say about the overall reduction in their volunteer hours; after all, some of them volunteer in order to fulfill service requirements for honor societies and youth groups, and spreading out their shifts means it will take longer to reach a volunteer hour goal. I am trying to take that concern into consideration, however, by providing opportunities for interested volunteers to earn extra hours. Many of our children's programs throughout the year benefit from having a few volunteers in the room to help things run smoothly; I have started sharing these program volunteer requests on our library's volunteer Facebook page and at Teen Advisory Board meetings. Additionally, volunteers are welcome to work as much as they want during our summer reading program. Thus, if a teen needs 30 hours of volunteer service, he or she can get those hours no problem with a bit of planning.I'm looking forward to debuting this new volunteer scheduling in January--I think it will really make for more enjoyable interactions for both volunteers and library staff. I'll be sure to report back.In the meantime, do you have volunteer tips, tricks, or stories to share? Sound off in the comments."},

McSweeney's McMullens. 11 Dec. 2012. p. 384.When The Expeditioners opens, young Kit West is in the Oceania marketplace with hopes of getting some food for himself and his siblings. Ever since Kit, Zander, and M.K.'s father died while on an exploration, the three children have had to fend for themselves. But when a mysterious man gives Kit a package from their father, the children learn that they may not know the full story of their explorer father's expeditions or his mysterious death. Codes, maps, and a few fortuitous interactions lead the West children to Arizona in search of the legendary Drowned Man's Canyon and its gold, and the trio hope they'll also discover why their father left them a secret quest to follow. Throughout their journey they encounter danger and adventure quite unlike anything they were expecting.This solid steam punk adventure borrows from dystopian fiction in its setting: after technology was shown to have manipulated and stifled human discovery, explorers learned that the world on the map we all know wasn't an accurate picture of our planet. With the discoveries of new lands and resources, however, came a shady, totalitarian government unafraid to use brute force to preserve its power. Not only do the West children have to face uncharted territories and unknown creatures in their adventure, but they must deal with a regime with unchecked control as well. Taylor provides a well-constructed, believable world for her young heroes. The story moves at a thrilling pace, and the adventure will capture the imagination of readers. Roy's illustrations add another terrific element to the story; the jacket, endpapers, and cover of the hardcover book are stunning. I hope this title marks the first in a series, as I can see many readers developing a fondness for the characters and a desire to see their adventures progress.I'll be suggesting this title to older middle grade readers who love adventure and steam punk, and I'll also hand sell it to readers who enjoy stories and non-fiction of exploration and geographical discoveries.Check out the book trailer!Review copy provided by the publisher."},

I did, however, select some new stories to keep my own enthusiasm as fresh as possible. Here are the three great books with beat I used. They're perfect for story times with a bit more song and dance than your usual offering.Busy Busy City Street by Cari Meister, illustrated by Steven Guarnaccia     This story combines simple, rhyming text with lovely illustrations. Whenever I've shared this book, kids are really into the fun images on the pages that correspond with the story itself. The repeated chorus of \"Honk! Honk! Beep! Beep! Busy, busy city street\" catches the attention of listeners, and by the end of the book they are quick to respond to my honks with beeps of their own.The Croaky Pokey by Ethan Long     This amphibious version of the Hokey Pokey is a lot of fun. Lots of young kids haven't really heard the Hokey Pokey before, so they are excited about discovering a song that is so interactive and silly (you put your backside in!). I sing the text of the book to get things going, and I jump around with my tongue stuck out to catch flies in the appropriate parts of the story.Farmyard Beat by Lindsey Craig, illustrated by Marc Brown     This book has so many great applications. It introduces a variety of farm animals and the sounds they make, it includes great sounds for promoting phonological awareness, and it boasts a great, consistent rhythm. Animals in the story cannot sleep because \"they've got that beat,\" and every listener quickly catches the beat, too.~~*~~What are some of your favorite books with beat to use in story times?"},

{"title": null, "date": "Wednesday, November 28, 2012", "text": "Last week on the ALSC listserv there was a thread (no, not that thread) of messages on the topic of library games for group visits. The question was posed in the context of a first grade boy scout visit--what sorts of activities do libraries offer for such a group visit? I shared a few examples of what we do here at my library, and after getting a some questions and requests to share details, I opted to expand here on the blog. Most of our scout groups and some school groups opt to visit the library as a means of introducing children to how the library is set up--the idea is to make them familiar with the library to encourage its use. We happily assist in this pursuit with scavenger hunts that get kids moving around the library.One such scavenger hunt (and I cannot take credit for it; a version of it was in use before I took my job) operates both as an exploration of the library and a decoding exercise. Library familiarity and literacy reinforcement rolled into one, hooray! This coded scavenger hunt involves a clue sheet with numbered clues; each clue prompts children to go to a specific section of the library, e.g., the juvenile graphic novels or the reference desk. When children make their way to each specified area of the library, they search for a small sign. These signs have a number and image that correspond to the clue on the kids' code sheet, and they also include a large uppercase letter. Children are prompted to write down that letter on their code sheets by the clue number; thus, if the sign for Clue #9 leads to the Wii games, and the Wii sign has the letter \"W\" on it, \"W\" becomes associated with #9. When children have found the letters that go with all twelve of our clues, they are ready to decode the message of the game. See the above images of our clue (left) and key (right) sheets to better visualize the setup.Another scavenger hunt uses the same sort of seek-and-find format albeit without the decoding aspect. I've written on this blog about our summer seek and find, where children look for an image of a book character who is mentioned at the library's entrance. During the academic year, we modify this premise to be a little more engaging. Children are given a sheet of paper with images of five or six children's book characters, each with a line next to it. Those same images are posted somewhere in the children's area of the library, and children are instructed to locate each of them. When a child locates an image, he or she is meant to write down (or dictate to a grown-up) the section in which the image is posted; for example, if Clifford is on a shelf with audiobooks, the child would write \"audiobooks\" or \"CD books\" on the sheet. This variation on the scavenger hunt works well for younger groups of children who may not yet have great reading skills--they are able to look for visual clues instead of trying to follow written ones.Mix in STEM!Our last scavenger hunt model features a bit of STEM mixed into the exploration. The hunt handout includes instructions like \"Go to the juvenile magazines. How many magazines for children does the library subscribe to?\" Each instruction includes a line for children to fill in; in this example, kids would write down the number of different magazines they count in the children's area. These activities include counting, measuring, reading a book list, and navigating Dewey, all of which support STEM skills as well as library knowledge. The one potential downside of this scavenger hunt is that it is text-heavy, and thus it often requires a larger number of adult \"team captains,\" if you will, to help the kiddos navigate the different activities. It's been a hit in the few times we've used it since creating it this fall, however, so it's a model worth trying out.All three of these scavenger hunts work for larger groups as well as small ones, although when there are lots of kids going on a hunt, I like to divide them into teams and stagger the starting place for each team. I also emphasize that the scavenger hunt is not a race--every participant gets a prize (usually a library pencil or a small piece of candy) for completing the hunt regardless of how quickly they do so. Things don't usually get too crazy during the hunt once kids know they need not rush around the library.Those are our three go-to activities for acquainting kids with the library when they come for a group visit. What do you do to entertain and inform children who visit your library?"},
{"title": null, "date": "Monday, November 26, 2012", "text": "Navigating the Laser FieldAfter I read two great 2012 middle grade novels featuring spies as a theme, I decided I needed to offer a Spy Club program at my library. After a bit of planning and recruiting teen volunteers, we offered the program to great success last week. Here's what we did:Spy ClubWhen the program room doors opened, kids were able to find a seat at a table set out of with supplies for creating disguises. No spy is ready for duty without an assortment of disguises, right? The end results of this station were varied, with some kids donning monocles and handlebar mustaches while others were rocking multicolor glasses and beauty spots that were really communication devices.During the disguise creation, I book talked two of the books that inspired the program theme: Sophia's War by Avi and Liar & Spy by Rebecca Stead. I emphasized that there are books with spies for all readers; these two books represent realistic fiction and historical fiction. Both were checked out after the program, as were a number of other spy-themed books we'd pulled for display in the program.Once disguises were in place, kiddos were able to rotate among four spy skills stations:Sharpshooting -- The Nerf guns from our Star Wars Jedi Academy were repurposed for shooting at traditional targets. A volunteer taped two lines to the floor as guides for the sharpshooters: one at an easier distance, and one more difficult.Laser Field -- I set up a station for navigating a laser field using tables, duct tape, and red crepe paper. Spies took turns working their way through the maze of laser beams. This station was by far the most popular, with children going through multiple times in an attempt to discover different paths through the field. (see picture above)Invisible Ink -- Tables were set up with cups of invisible ink (a mixture of lemon juice with a bit of water), cotton swabs for writing, and plain white paper. Messages needed to dry before they were completely invisible, so the reading of the secret messages took place at home with the assistance of a hair dryer or warm lighbulb.Cryptography -- I had created a code key and secret message using a pictograph font in Word, and the young spies spent a bit of time decoding the message. Once decoded, it instructed them to go to the reference desk for a reward (candy).With just a few minutes left in the program, I announced that spies should be finishing up at their current stations. We ended with a reminder that books were available for check-out; both fiction and non-fiction accounts of spies went like hot cakes. Lots of children were spotted leaving the library in disguise, too--an indicator, I think, that they'd enjoyed themselves."},

{"title": null, "date": "Wednesday, November 21, 2012", "text": "One of my favorite things to come out of the revised Every Child Ready to Read is the emphasis on talking to and with young children. Hearing and engaging in talk helps children to develop a sense of the rhythm of fluent speech. Talking about objects in the world around us and pictures in a story help to build vocabulary and an understanding of how the world works, too. Without engaging in plenty of talk before they start school, children begin their attempts to read with a massive conceptual deficit. They just don't make as many connections between words, what they mean, and what describes them.That point--the relative advantage given to children who talk and are talked with--was recently emphasized to me in a series of outreach story times all featuring the same book. The book in this example: I Spy with My Little Eye by Edward Gibbs. The book is a series of \"I Spy\" games: a two-page spread allows the children to spy an animal's color while a speech bubble gives a hint what the animal is; and the following two-page spread displays the animal for children to see in full. A sample spread would be as follows: \"I spy with my little eye something that is white. [speech bubble: I live in the Arctic.] / I am a polar bear!\" Simple enough from the reader's perspective.What I've noticed in sharing this book with a variety of groups is that some story time audiences are quick to shout out what animal they spy while others need the page turn to really know what's going on. One preschool, when the children spied red, immediately guessed \"fox\"--and another preschool only knew it was a fox after seeing the full illustration; not even the hint \"I have a bushy tail\" gave away the animal's identity for the latter group.What's my point? Obviously both groups know what a fox is. The kids in the first preschool, though, were able to guess \"fox\" using context clues--at some point in their lives, they have talked about foxes, which are often red and which have bushy tails. The can connect \"fox\" and \"red\" and \"bushy tail\" in a sort of concept map. The kids in the second preschool, on the other hand, weren't able to piece it all together using concept knowledge; they know a fox when they see one, but they have to see it to know it could be a fox.This discrepancy really illustrates the importance of talking with children all the time. It's important to talk about foods we see on the table, at the grocery store, or in a restaurant; it's important to talk about the clothes we see when we're shopping, the clothes in our closets, and the weather we wear them in. It's important to talk about everything a child encounters in life and in books because that talk gives kids the ability to name and understand things they'll see later on in life or in books. And if they understand it now, they've got a better chance of being able to read about it later. Talking can give such an advantage to children from any background. I cannot overemphasize the importance of talk.Have you encountered any situations that really emphasized for you the important of talk in developing early literacy? How do your express the importance of talk to caregivers?"},

This title is no exception, as three cows get up to all kinds of mischief in the name of fun, much to Chicken's chagrin.Song: \"Chicken Won't Allow\"     This song is an adaptation of a perenially popular camp song, \"Mama Don't Allow.\" I figured that Chicken in our first story had lots of rules--why not break some with a song?Chicken won't allow any hand clappin' 'round here.

With a few small modifications--the reader presses while the audience helps count dots, report on color changes, and perform small actions when asked--this book is a surefire hit with preschool crowds. They always seem genuinely enchanted by how doing what the book says causes the dots to behave in funny ways. I would not have expected this book to be such a hit, but I am now glad to have it in my story time arsenal.Story: Let's Sing a Lullaby with the Brave Cowboy by Jan Thomas     I mentioned that I love Jan Thomas, right? This newest title is no exception, especially because it involves using a cowboy voice and some pretty funny discussion of what it means to be brave. Kids enjoy the lullaby aspect of the book, too, and that device serves to make the book a perfect calming end to story time.Song: \"If You're Happy and You Know It\"     In what has become a sort of standard closing for my outreach story times, I broke out the ukulele to accompany our singing of this song. Instead of doing the ordinary clapping, stomping, and shouting, we reviewed our stories by making the noises of some of the animals characters we'd met throughout the program. During our last verse, we all waved goodbye."},
{"title": null, "date": "Monday, November 12, 2012", "text": "My library district has a successful and longstanding partnership with a local chapter of Love On a Leash, an organization of therapy pets and their owners. Our partnership supports a program we call Tale Waggers, where children have the opportunity to read to therapy dogs. The rationale behind the program is twofold: 1) reading aloud can be stressful for many children, yet reading to a dog is comforting and judgment-free; and 2) most kids love dogs. Thus we attract children and their caregivers with an enticing program.Our program is scheduled to last one hour (although we occasionally run a bit over because a child really wants to finish reading a story to a dog). In the past, we've operated the program in two different ways. One option is to have a list of the dogs with time slots next to their names; on a first come, first served basis, children sign up for a ten-minute time slot with a dog. Another option is to allow multiple children to gather around a single dog at a time, at which point they take turns reading. Option #2 tends to work best with the crowd at my library; there's always a rush to sit near and read to a dog at the top of the hour, and allowing multiple kiddos at each dog \"station\" helps with the flow of things. By the last fifteen minutes, our crowd has dissipated to just a handful of children; these readers get the full benefit of a one-on-one reading session. Knowing that's the format our program usually takes leads me to recommend that caregivers of struggling or shy readers come toward the second half of the program, when the child will be able to read to a dog without an audience.Many children bring books they've selected on their own to read to the dogs--things they're reading for school and things they just grabbed off the children's stacks. I also like to have a table of great reads available in the program for quick selection. I aim to provide books for a variety of interests and abilities, and I also consider whether the book (or its chapters) are short enough to a) not frustrate a struggling reader and b) take up too much time while other readers are waiting. This month I included selections from recent #SharpSchu Book Club discussions. When in doubt of books to suggest to kids, look to Mr. Sharp and Mr. Schu!We've got a core group of program-attendees who are always looking forward to the next Tale Waggers program. Have you ever sought out a local therapy pets group to volunteer at your library? I highly encourage you to see what's available in your area."},
{"title": null, "date": "Friday, November 9, 2012", "text": "Good ideas were flying every which way at YALSA's YA Literature Symposium in St. Louis last weekend. I always love hearing what colleagues across the country are doing in their libraries, and the topic of teen services is always fascinating--there is constant innovation going on in the realm of YA. I tend to leave conferences overflowing with ideas of things to try in my own library, and the Lit Symposium was no different. I already shared some sound bites from the weekend; now here's a list of five things I want to try in my own library after hearing about them at the conference.1. Virtual Book Club for Teens     There are a couple of teen customers at my branch who have asked us to host a teen book club. We did a bit of research and discussion, and we determined that teens' school reading assignments and work/school schedules would greatly impact attendance at a book club. A possible solution: a virtual book club for teens. I heard great things about the Subtext app at the conference; it's a free app that allows readers to comment and discuss inside of a book. Libraries are able to create groups for their book clubbers, creating a closed space for a book discussion with a specific audience. I am really intrigued by the flexibility a virtual book club would provide: teens can participate when it suits their schedules; teens from all libraries in the district can participate without having to visit a library distant from their homes; and teens who feel uncomfortable talking aloud in groups can be a dynamic part of discussion. We're going to look into the possibility of hosting a virtual teen book club via Subtext, a Yahoo! group, or even Facebook. I'd love to hear if you do anything along these lines!2. A \"What We're Reading\" Board     Peer behavior is a huge influence for teens, and many libraries use that truth to their advantage in order to get more teens reading. Having a \"What We're Reading\" board in the teen area of the library, along with some writing supplies, allows teens to share the title and author of the books they're currently reading in a sort of public forum. When teens see what their peers are reading, they start to look for those same books, too. Think the spread-the-word popularity of The Hunger Games but on a smaller scale for many more books. We're figuring out a good space in the branch to get our board started.3. Book Trailers in Programming     One of my favorite programs at the conference was on the topic of male readers, and four local St. Louis high schoolers sat on the panel to share their thoughts. They all agreed on one particular thing: engage and excite readers with book trailers. With so much media everywhere in teen life these days, sometimes that brief visual teaser for a book is what's necessary to generate a reader's interest. I'm talking to my teen person about including book trailers in our book chat teen programs, and I'll also be incorporating them more often for my middle grade readers. 4. Updated Book Lists for Teens     Providing books for teens means finding a collection balance between classic/favorite books and what's new and hot in YA. We do well in keeping an updated collection--but not necessarily so with our book lists. I love the great and comprehensive listing ideas that were shared at the conference: LGBTQ reads, realistic fiction, blurred genres... There are so many fabulous lists and resources out there that creating book lists for teens needn't be a strenuous process. Do some searching online, poll your teen readers, and make lists with all the newest books your teens will love to read.﻿image from SLJ5. Diversifying Author Visits.﻿﻿     When push comes to shove, my library branch isn't big enough to host the sort of large-scale events some of our larger branches can. Does that mean our readers should have to either a) travel to a further-away branch or b) miss out? Absolutely not! A potential answer: Skype visits. Skype visits do require some technological hardware--computer, webcam, microphone, projector, screen--but the benefits outweight those up front costs. Readers get to engage with authors via Skype, asking questions and having meaningful conversations. Many authors are happy to do Skype visits for discounted fees or, occassionally, for free, making the program a win-win situation for libraries that can't bring an author physically to the branch.     My interest was also piqued by comments from libraries who pass out copies of author visit books to community members for free in the weeks leading up to a program. In the examples I heard discussed, copies of the books are funded by grants. Does your library have experience with a format like this? I'd love to hear more.~~*~~What are your top takeaways from the 2012 YALSA YA Literature Symposium?"},
{"title": null, "date": "Wednesday, November 7, 2012", "text": "Play is an integral component of developing reading readiness. Folks have been touting that belief for a while, and the inclusion of \"play\" as one of five early literacy practices in the revised Every Child Ready to Read solidified it as fact. Play is fun, sure, but it's also a developmentally appropriate way for children to map concepts onto words. It's one thing to know the word for \"train\"; play allows children to learn what a train is and what it does. Play is very important.All 12 kits, ready to go to branches.If you're like pretty much every library I've ever been to, though--including my own--you don't necessarily have a lot of room to inject many more opportunities for play into your library. And then you have to consider the cost of toys and space for storage, too. These considerations are obstacles, but they are absolutely surmountable. How?Early Literacy Play Kits.In my library district, we created twelve distinct Early Literacy Play Kits--enough for one to be at each of our twelve branches every month of the year. These kits are basically boxes of toys: there's a puppet kit with three boxes of puppets, a puzzle kit, a play food kit, a baby activities kit... Our team of children's librarians had some lively discussions about what types of toys we would like to incorporate in our branches if we had funds and space, and we created our list of twelve theme kits from there. We were able to collaborate and select items that we knew would be used by children in our libraries.We selected kits that cover the whole pre-reader spectrum. We've got baby-safe stations like bead mazes; juggling scarves and wrist ribbons perfect for dancing two- and three-year-olds; blocks for children of every age; and a mailbox to encourage writing among the set who are really into working on their letters. We intentionally tried to incorporate dramatic play, basic math, letter recognition, and diverse vocabulary across the spectrum of all our kits.The free play station in Picture Book City at my branch.The beauty of these Early Literacy Play Kits is twofold. 1) A branch only has to find space to store one kit per month, yet it benefits from having twelve different sets of toys in the branch every calendar year. 2) A branch can use its monthly kit however it chooses: in programs, set out in the children's area, by internet computers to keep young ones productively entertained while the caregiver is online... Possibilities are limited only by staff imagination. In October, for example, my branch had one of our food kits, which includes placemats, plastic dishes, and some play food. Throughout the month my staff and I used the play food at the end of some of our programs for free play. We also had a few place settings and a play pizza out in the children's area all month. Boy was that table popular, with kids of all ages serving up slices for their siblings and caregivers.Is your interest piqued, but you're afraid the process of purchasing, creating, sharing, and maintaining the kits is too burdensome? Let me assure you that the logistics of the kits aren't that difficult.I love toy deliveries.Purchasing: After securing a $3000 grant from our Library Foundation, our selected toys were purchased and delivered to my branch.Creation: Volunteers helped label every toy piece with the library's initials, and I separated our toys into plastic containers with locking lids. The final containers contain box inventories, age and cleaning recommendations, and a schedule of the kit rotation--everyone always knows what kit they'll have which month.Sharing: Each branch has a kit for a month, at which point the kit travels to its next branch via our delivery crew (they already run materials and supplies deliveries every day, so the addition of a kit or two doesn't add undue strain on the system).Maintenance: Staff are responsible for using the kits as they see fit, then cleaning and inventorying the boxes at the end of each month before sending it on its way. Once a year, all kits will return to me to update inventories and order replacement items if necessary.It's really pretty simple: a variety of toys that promote early literacy while requiring minimal work and space constraints. Give Early Literacy Play Kits a try in your library system. I would bet you'll hear positive things from staff--who have new, fun items to use in programs--as well as kids and caregivers who enjoy the toys in your children's spaces.Incorporate more play in your library!"},

{"title": null, "date": "Monday, November 5, 2012", "text": "I spent the weekend at YALSA's Young Adult Literature Symposium in St. Louis. The general premise for the conference was the future of YA literature, and the programs and panel speakers really helped attendees to look forward to what's coming and explore ideas for innovating and adapting our services. I've got plenty of session info circulating in my brain right now, and I'll be chatting with my teen person on Wednesday regarding her thoughts on the conference. I don't want to share too much until after we've talked, but I do want to whet your appetite with three of my favorite sound bites from the conference. Without further ado...\"Readers will be the upstanders, not the bystanders.\" --Patricia McCormick     Reading is a powerful thing, what with its capacity to introduce us to new ideas, places, and people. Readers are the ones who are informed, who have a more diverse worldview, who have empathy for others they might not know but have seen in the pages of beloved books. And so readers are the ones who will stand up for what is right in the world. Teens absolutely get behind this sentiment.\"Great books for teens serve as a mirror and a window.\" --David Levithan     Books help us explore aspects of ourselves that we might otherwise have difficulty recognizing or admitting--they act as mirrors for seeing who we are as people. Books also act as windows, allowing us to see what the world is like for others. Levithan shared an anecdote about a librarian who said she wasn't going to buy a book with a multicultural protagonist because she didn't have any \"ethnic\" readers. All the more reason to have that book.\"Teens are multidisciplinary beings.\" --Scott Westerfeld     Teens have two jobs: to attend school and to grow up. Going to school means a variety of courses, and so the very nature of teenage existence is multidisciplinary, with exposure to and interest in multiple subjects. One of the great things about good YA literature is that it taps into that multidisciplinarity. Genres blur, topics overlap...and readers love it because it reflects the world they inhabit, which does not have such precise delineations that adult fiction often seeks to reinforce. Teens love to read varied books, and to vary their reading.~~*~~Come back later this week for discussion of some of the ideas I brought home from #yalit12."},
{"title": null, "date": "Friday, November 2, 2012", "text": "Lego robot!Let me make one thing clear right up front: I am not claiming responsibility for the idea of Lego Club. No, Lego Club has been in existence, both at my library and at other libraries worldwide, since way before I became a librarian. What I do claim: Lego Club is engaging for kids of all ages, easy to manage from a staff perspective, and enjoyable for everyone involved.I think everyone should seriously consider hosting a Lego Club at the library. Here's how we operate ours.The Supplies. Most of our Legos have been purchased through grants from our Friends of the Library (Friends--We love you! Thank you for your support!!). We've made three big purchases since my branch began offering a Lego Club a few years ago; we've probably spent between $500 and $750 on Legos at this point. I would argue that you can start a Lego Club with $250-$300 for purchasing your initial supplies. Some things to keep in mind in purchasing your Legos:Do purchase a good number of baseplates; lots of kids prefer to build on these foundations rather than just start free-form building.Do make sure you have lots of Lego people, as one or two of your frequent program attendees will spend most of their building time hunting and hoarding the figures.Don't worry about buying a \"correct\" proportion of the new pink Legos \"for girls.\" I know lots of people have lots of thoughts about these frill-ified pieces, but I don't want to get into that here. The only thing that is worth your consideration in purchasing your Legos is that all of your blocks will get jumbled together, and their colors will largely not matter.Do get some containers to hold the Legos during the program. Whether these containers are the ones the Legos come with or are generic plastic containers doesn't matter--any containers will keep hundreds of little pieces from ending up on your program room floor.We've also added to our collection through donations of used Legos--parents and grandparents looking to clean out the former playspaces of their grown kids are often happy to know that those Legos they spent so much money on will go to a good home. My advice if you do decide to accept used Legos: be prepared with a strategy to clean them. Dust gets into all of those little crevices.The Audience. Our monthly Lego Club is open to all school-age children and their siblings. That is to say that our target audience is K through 5, but we recognize that some younger siblings are going to want to tag along. That's fine with us. I know of plenty of libraries that actually split their Lego kiddos into two separate sessions, K-2 and 3-5. This model doesn't really work for us; it creates problems for families with kids in both age ranges, and it limits the breadth of interaction and collaboration during the programs. Thus we have one all-ages session and expect to have a full room. We get a good balance between boys and girls in attendance. Also, you will have plenty of caregivers attending with their kids, especially dads. The only time I've ever seen more dads engaged in a library program was during our Jedi Academy.The Scheduling Logistics. We host our program on the last Monday of the month. We find that we have outstandingly regular attendance at this time, as the week hasn't gotten too busy yet and no one feels too worn out by the week that early on. We usually host the Lego Club from 6 to 7 p.m. on those Mondays to allow kids from all sorts of families to attend. We have two exceptions to that consistent time slot: during winter break, when we offer the program at 2 p.m. because of the plethora of evening holiday commitments; and during the summer, when we offer both a 2 p.m. and a 6 p.m. session to accommodate our larger seasonal audience. The consistency really works--kids know exactly when Lego Club will happen, and they anxiously await it.The Program Room. I like to provide plenty of opportunities for collaboration in our Lego Club programs, so I set up two long tables and have plenty of chairs surrounding each (usually 15-20 chairs per table). There is plenty of room for kids to move around to search other builders' buckets for a specific piece they need, and there is also space for both collaboration and individual focus.The Program Format. Every Lego Club has a theme, and children are encouraged to build a creation based on that theme. (Note: If they want to ignore the theme and do their own thing, that's fine, too. Support creativity!). Recent themes at my Lego Clubs have included Robots, Mad Scientist, and It Came From Outer Space! I've found that kids look forward to the grand unveiling of the month's theme--which is really just me announcing the theme in a silly voice.Our hour-long program breaks down roughly into four segments:6:00-6:05 -- Kids and caregivers come into the room, grab a baseplate if they want, and find a seat at one of our tables. I announce the theme for the evening.6:05-6:50 -- Free building time. During this time, kids build and I mill about the room talking to kids, seeking out specific building pieces someone has requested, and just having positive, friendly interactions with everyone. I love asking about what the kids are building--even the youngest ones are very deliberate about how they make their creations. As we near the end of our free building time, I encourage kids to write the names of their creations on blank notecards, as well as their names. We use these cards in our displays.6:50-6:58ish -- We \"tour\" the evening's creations. Each child has the opportunity to talk about what he/she created; some love to share their work, others shyly just repeat the evening's theme and then hide behind their caregivers.6:58-7:00 -- Cleaning up the building area. I enlist the help of all Lego Club participants in checking the floor for errant Lego blocks, and they help get all of the unused pieces into our tubs. As kids leave the program, I always remind them to come see their creations on display in the library before the next meeting of the Lego Club. I also encourage them to check out a book on the evenings theme; we always have a table of such books available by the program room door.Kids' creations on display in the library.The Display. After years of tearing kids' creations apart at the end of each Lego Club, we asked our Friends of the Library group to grant us some funds to buy some display cases in which we could house children's work between programs. We purchased eight basketball-size display units, and for the time being that is sufficient to house at least a portion of each child's creation each month. Kids love seeing their work when they come to the library, and having Lego creations on display has generated tons of interest in the program among kids and families who hadn't known about it. If you have space, I highly recommend displaying your Lego Club creations in the library. Even if you can't invest in displays, find a shelf out of reach of toddlers and stick those creations up there. It really helps kids develop pride in their work as well as a sense of ownership in the library.~~*~~That's it. That's how we engage 30+ kids in extremely fun programming that helps develop STEAM skills every month. Once you get your supplies and get into a rhythm, it's a program that requires minimal prep and practically runs itself. Yet for how simple it can be for staff, it has a remarkably positive impact on kids. Lego Club is a solid investment in programming and intellectual engagement.Do you have questions about how we run Lego Club at my library? What about comments on how you run a similar program in your neck of the woods? Sound off in the comments!"},
{"title": null, "date": "Wednesday, October 31, 2012", "text": "I have long loved Abby the Librarian's \"Day in the Life\" posts, which share the details of what she does on a random day in her job. I loved reading them back when I was still in library school--they helped me to get a sense of the crazy awesomeness I was getting myself into. I know that it can be helpful for current and future librarians to see what their colleagues do, so I am shamelessly copying Abby and writing about a day in my life as children's librarian at my branch. The following events took place on Monday of this week.10:30 a.m. - Visit a local daycare for an outreach story time visit. Since the outreach visit started my day, I had packed my Story Time bag before leaving the branch on Friday afternoon. I grabbed a few extra books by some favorite authors, as this particular daycare can be a rough crowd as far as attention spans are concerned. I also brought my ukulele for some song time. That instrument is quickly becoming one of my favorite librarian accessories.11:15 a.m. - Return to the branch and check in with staff who have been working since the library opened. Chat includes library news as well as details of everyone's weekends.11:30 a.m. - Walk around the children's area of the library. I'm always a fan of doing a walk-through to see how things are going in the children's area, but I've been making more frequent visits since we implemented our new neighborhoods organization scheme. Customers have nothing but positive things to say about the change--it looks like we've really helped make their browsing easier.11:45 a.m. - Do some work from my desk, including catching up on e-mails. I e-mailed some documents from my Preschool Science program series to a librarian who saw last week's ALSC Blog post; gave our district-wide volunteer head some feedback on our volunteer process; and finalized the event listings for our December-February children's programs at the branch.12:45 p.m. - Put together a new shelving unit for our big books, which we have plans to catalog and make available for circulation in the coming months.1:00 p.m. - On the reference desk. Our reference shifts are usually four hours long. In addition to responding to customers' reference requests during my shift, I also supervised a volunteer as she worked on display and withdrawal tasks; confirmed our November program visits from a group with therapy dogs; and put in some work on my I Spy board (another brilliant idea of Abby's).5:00 p.m. - Dinner. I usually spend my breaks looking through Twitter and library blogs on my Google Reader. (Is anyone surprised?)5:30 p.m. - Set up for our monthly Lego Club program. Our branch pages help get the room set up for the program, with two long tables, chairs, and a table for displaying our final creations. I make sure Legos are evenly distributed in the buckets, cut some paper for name placards, and set out markers. The pages also set out all the theme-related books a volunteer had pulled for the program.6:00 p.m. - Lego Club! This is my first return to Lego Club after a hiatus of a few months, during which time a coworker ran the program. I chose the theme of Robots. (Full post, with photos, to come later this week...)7:00 p.m. - Clean up after Lego Club. A colleague brought his sons to the program, and we chat about some outreach and early literacy things while I straighten up.7:15 p.m. - Finish up my day back in my office. I enter program attendance statistics from the day, double check what is going on the rest of the week, and read the e-mails that had come in since dinner. I also check out a stack of books for my Cybils reading.7:30 p.m. - Go home."},
{"title": null, "date": "Monday, October 29, 2012", "text": "In the lead-up to Halloween, my branch celebrates all things autumn with an annual Fall Festival. While it's not technically a Halloween program--we don't want to cause any non-Halloween celebrators to feel excluded--there is plenty of candy and traditional autumn fun. Think sweets, black and orange, and not-too-scary things that go bump in the night. Our school-age program crowd has come to look forward to our annual Fall Festival, where they know they will encounter a few program elements that are always at hit. The general program elements at each fall festival are in bold; the details of the specific thing I did this year follow.Treats -- Really, what is a festival without yummy things to eat? One of my staffers always buys a ton of candy to have for her preschool fall festival and to pass out in the branch on Halloween, and the school-age fall festivities benefit from her generous candy purchasing. I have yet to find a kid who is not a fan of Double Stuf Oreos.Storytelling -- I like to tell a story whenever I have a group of school-age kids in a program; sometimes it's the only opportunity they have to hear oral storytelling. This year I opted to go with a cut and tell story: \"The Little Orange House\". I love cut and tell stories for two reasons. Reason number one is that it gives the more fidgety listeners something to focus on while they are listening; reason number two is that young listeners always seem fascinated at how a few simple cuts in paper could result in something story-related. Try it out.Craft -- This year we made sack-o-lanterns, or carved pumpkin luminaria. I had paper sacks, black construction paper, scissors, glue sticks, and markers out on our tables, and the children were able to cut out whatever shapes they wanted to create their sack-o-lanterns' faces. Several children insisted that mine needed a mustache, so I obliged.Team Game -- School-age program attendees are split pretty well in half into two categories: those who attend alone, and those who attend with a sibling or friend. I like to have a mingling, camaraderie-building aspect to the program so kids meet new people, so I try to always include a team game. For this fall festival, I had a ring relay race. The kid were split into two even teams, and each team had a set of 10 rings (either orange spiders or black bats). One team member at a time had to put on all ten rings, run to the other side of the room to tap a chair, run back, remove the rings, and then pass them on to the next team member. The first team whose members all completed the challenge first won. It was a close race, and we witnessed some very creative definitions of what it meant to \"put on\" the rings.Candy Corn Bingo -- I am pretty sure that veteran Fall Festival attendees would mutiny if we didn't play Candy Corn Bingo. Using pieces of candy corn, kids mark custom bingo cards from DLTK that are decorated with fall-themed images as each image is called by the program leader. Whenever a child got a Bingo, he or she got to claim a fun-size candy bar or Blow Pop, clear his/her card, and start anew. We kept playing until everyone had won twice. These kids get really into Candy Corn Bingo, and ending our Fall Festival with the game is always a hit."},
{"title": null, "date": "Friday, October 26, 2012", "text": "For the past few years, my library district has partnered with the county ambulance district to put on a series of Halloween safety programs for our customers. My branch's program this year, aimed at preschoolers and their caregivers, was a lot of fun. The program opened with an ambulance tour; two EMTs demonstrated the stretcher, heartbeat monitor, and lights on the ambulance, much to the delight of the kiddos.Then we moved inside for a brief presentation about being safe on Halloween. Grownups, here are a few of the tips:1. Make sure costumes are not too long; long capes, pants, skirts, etc., can cause children to trip and hurt themselves.2. Always accompany children while trick-or-treating, regardless of their age.3. Be visible. The ambulance district handed out reflective candy bags and glow stick bracelets for kids to use on Halloween, but additional reflective clothing is great.After reviewing our safety tips, we moved into the story time portion of our program. I read one of my new favorites for the spooky season, Creepy Carrots. Have you read it yet? Illustrator extraordinaire Peter Brown made a great video about its creation, too.Then it was time for crafts. I opted for one structured craft and one that was more open-ended. We made paper plate ghosts (thanks, Pinterest!), then I handed out blank sheets of paper for kids to draw themselves in their Halloween getups. I loved seeing the pictures they drew--they are so proud of their costumes!Have a fun and safe Halloween, everyone!"},

{"title": null, "date": "Wednesday, October 24, 2012", "text": "Please complete the following statement: Two-year-olds love _________.     a) stories     b) songs     c) dancing     d) all of the aboveDid you select d) all of the above? Because it's true! Libraries traditionally focus on sharing stories in preschool programming, and while most program plans will involve some songs and maybe some dance, stories are definitely the main event. Have you ever considered a program where stories, songs, and dancing all have equal parts? Such a program can be lots of fun for kids and caregivers. Here's just such a program that was recently a total hit with two-year-olds at my library.Opening Song: \"If You're Happy and You Know It\" + ukulele     As each two-year-old came into the program, he or she got a name tag. I opened the program by welcoming each child individually by name and asking if he or she had a favorite animal. I wrote the favorite animals on our dry erase board. Writing down what children say helps them make the connection that written marks have meaning.     After the first \"clap your hands\" verse of our song, we repeated it by going through our list of favorite animals. We had some repeats, so in the end we were giraffes (stretching our necks), elephants (making trunks with an arm), dogs (barking), and cats (meowing). This opening song got everyone loosened up and set the stage for a really energetic program.Story: Is Everyone Ready for Fun? by Jan Thomas     The cows in this story keep doing silly things on Chicken's sofa, like jumping and wiggling. Reading this story aloud invites lots of action, and it's a funny read, too.Song and Dance: \"Mahna Mahna\" by The Muppets     I passed out rhythm sticks for this song (as I saw done at the ALSC Institute), and we grooved to the silly song for a few minutes. We worked on tapping a rhythm on our sticks, then we moved on to tapping fast, slow, up high, down low, and (most difficult) behind our backs. There was lots of movement during this number!Story: King Bidgood's in the Bathtub by Audrey Wood     I love this story. It has great rhythm, is an easy-to-follow story with a repetitive pattern, and cracks kids up with its hilarity every time. Plus it's always fun to make the \"glub glub glub\" noises when the page lets all the bath water go down the drain.Song and Dance: \"Splish Splash\" by Bobby Darin     Go ahead, try to play this song and then not dance. It's simply a tune to be danced to! Our dance moves came from miming like we were taking a bath: washing our arms, legs, and hair. We also did some silly things like swimming in the bathtub and holding our noses.Story: Dancing Feet by Lindsey Craig     While we were still standing from our \"Splish Splash\" dance, I pulled out this great rhythmic story that includes lots of fun animals. We danced on our tippity feet, our stompity feet, and our very own feet.Story: Go Away, Big Green Monster by Ed Emberley     Whew! We needed a bit of a break at this point, so all the kiddos sat down while I read Go Away, Big Green Monster--a perennial October favorite. My two-year-olds were really getting into the groove of a participatory story time, as they chimed in to say \"Go away!\" toward the end of the story.Song and Dance: \"Monster Boogie\" by the Laurie Berkner Band     I love songs whose lyrics narrate their dance moves; Laurie Berkner is great for just such tunes. For this song, we stomped around the room pretending to be monsters, and we intermittently bared our teeth, wiggled, danced, and roared.Craft: Make-your-own ribbon dancer     Our craft involved three supplies: the cardboard tube from a dry cleaners' pants hanger; a length of fabric ribbon; and some duct tape. With some assistance from their caregivers, the children taped their ribbons to their cardboard tubes to create a ribbon dancer, perfect for dancing. We even danced in some bubbles after the craft was finished! We had a great time popping those bubbles and shimmying to some surf songs from Jan and Dean.~~~There you have it, a simple program that matches stories, songs, and dancing perfectly. I'm confident this sort of program plan would work really well for, shall we say, energetic outreach classrooms as well."},
{"title": null, "date": "Monday, October 22, 2012", "text": "This is what it used tolook like, jumbled andhard to browse.For this, my 100th blog post here at the Show Me Librarian, I want to share with you my branch's new picture book setup.Let's start back in June in Anaheim. I was at the 2012 ALA Annual Conference, and I was sitting in a program called \"I WANT A TRUCK BOOK! Reorganizing Your Picture Book Collection to Meet the Needs of Young Patrons and their Caregivers.\" Gretchen Caserotti, she of Darien Library and LJ 2010 Mover and Shaker fame, was the first speaker, and she talked about her library's wildly successful reorganization of its \"kidlit\" collection--picture books for the under-5 crowd. It's safe to say that I was greatly intrigued by what Gretchen said. Organizing picture books in a manner that empowers both kids (i.e., pre-readers) and caregivers to really use the collection? YES! Where do I sign up?Here's a look at some of our shelves inPicture Book City following the reorganization.I came back from Anaheim completely invigorated and full of excitement at the potential of reorganizing the picture books in my branch. I took a few days to work out the details of how I would proceed, and then I explained the concept and project plan to my branch manager. She agreed to let me shake things up after only three minutes of conversation--I never even had to break out my persuasive statistics. The next few months in the branch were spent a) confirming the categories we'd break our picture books into, and b) giving picture books a colored sticker to correspond with their category. Volunteers were a huge help in getting some of the straightforward stickering underway with the help of subject lists; I did the more time-intensive work of opening a picture book, reading enough of it to determine its category, then stickering it.In progress--so many piles!That's how we proceeded until last week, however. My branch was closed Monday through Thursday for some painting and electrical work, but staff were still assigned shifts to work while the public was not in the building. In those four days, thanks to a number of extremely helpful and hardworking staff, we finished our project. Monday and Tuesday consisted of stickering every remaining picture book in one of our eight categories, or neighborhoods as we now call them. Wednesday consisted of putting the books in each neighborhood in alphabetical order (some on shelves, some in piles), and on Thursday we scanned and shelved. Yes, we scanned every single picture book, then shelved them alphabetically within their new neighborhood locations. That's approximately 8000 books. In one day. With a team of five. I owe them treats.Ta-da!When we opened again at 9 a.m. on Friday morning, our picture books were converted into what is now called Picture Book City (fun wooden sign to come, as soon as I make it). One of my staffers took pictures of our C-shaped picture book area and stitched them together for a sort of 180 effect; can you see the lovely rainbow? Each neighborhood begins with a sign explaining both the types of books in the neighborhood and the purpose of the Picture Book City neighborhood system. I also made handouts to explain our neighborhood categories.One of my favorite parts of Friday--our first day with the new system, when people could have been really confused or upset by the change--was hearing so many caregivers express how simple and navigable our picture books now are. When I was in the children's section explaining the system to a mom and her son, I asked the young boy what types of stories he likes; he said \"trucks,\" and literally within moments he was able to find all of the truck books. He and his mom were thrilled. These are the reactions I'm getting pretty much across the board. I cannot wait until our story times start again next week to see how our program-goers like it. I'm also looking forward to watching our picture book circulation statistics over the coming months. I'll report back.Now that the ever-populartransportation books are inone place, I can tell I needto buy more. Lots more.I could not have reorganized the picture books at my branch without the support and physical labor of so many branch staff and volunteers. I am likewise indebted to Gretchen and the awesome team of children's librarians at the Darien Library; they planted the idea in my head, let me bounce my ideas for modifying their system off of them, and provided me with much-needed encouragement in the more stressful stages of the process.Because, yes, it was stressful. And yes, it took a while. I shudder to think how chaotic it would have been to finish the reorganization had the branch not been closed. But all things considered, it's worth it. Kids finding books more easily?Oh, it is so worth it."},

She said always displays students' artwork in the hallways at school, but would we consider displaying student artwork in the library? Her idea was that she'd take care of selecting students' artwork, preparing it for display, and bringing it to me at the library. My job would be to display it where it would be visible to library visitors. Each batch of artwork would stay up in the library for 5-6 weeks, at which point she'd bring me some new student pieces. She hoped more families from the elementary school would visit the library with the added \"art gallery\" incentive. It sounded like a great idea to me--a fun way to build a relationship with a local school, display the talents of kids in the community, and possibly draw in families of non-library users.Our first batch of artwork has been up in our children's area for a little over a month at this point. When it came time to decide how to display the artwork, I opted for a simple setup: colored clothespins on string hold up the artwork, and a bent paper clip suspends the string from our ceiling tiles. Artwork is only displayed against a wall, minimizing the likelihood that it will turn and become unviewable. We have already learned that standard printer paper-size pieces display best, with larger projects working most of the time if they are portrait-oriented. Anything much bigger starts to curl at the corners. I haven't noticed too many kids coming to the library specifically to look at the artwork, but plenty of folks have commented on how it livens up the children's space. I'm excited to see what sort of pieces we'll get next!Do you display children's artwork in the library? Are displayed pieces created in the library, or do you show children's creations from school or other places? How do you partner with schools in non-traditional ways?"},
{"title": null, "date": "Wednesday, October 17, 2012", "text": "I started my second set of fall outreach story time visits this week, and once again I included titles nominated for the Missouri Building Block Picture Book Award. I chose two of the nominated titles that include dogs, then I rounded out the story time with a few other favorite animals: cats and fish. Here's what I did:Opening Song: \"Open, Shut Them\"Story: Rrralph by Lois Ehlert     Ralph has a special skill: he can talk! Throughout the story, the narrator asks Ralph questions; Ralph replies with words like \"bark,\" \"wolf,\" and \"rough\"--all words that sound like common dog sounds. Some of the kids may have been too young to get the word play joke, but the whole audience enjoyed imitating each of Ralph's sounds.Fingerplay: \"Two Little Puppy Dogs\"Two Little Puppy DogsTwo little puppy dogs, lying in a heap.extend two fingersSoft and wooly and fast asleep.pet fingersAlong came a pussycat creeping near,extend finger on other hand\"Meow, meow,\" she cried in their ears.say \"meow\"Two little puppy dogs after one cat;have two fingers chase one fingerHave you ever played tag like that?Story: Dog in Boots by Greg Gormley     After Dog reads the story of Puss in Boots, he decides that he wants shoes for himself. The shoe salesman gives him plenty of options, but no pair of shoes is equally good for all Dog's needs: digging, swimming, scratching, running... When the shoe salesman suggests Dog already has the perfect shoes--his paws--Dog realizes he has all the footwear he needs. The language in this book doesn't roll off the tongue quite as easily as in others, but the children seem to enjoy the story.Story: Pete the Cat: Rocking in My School Shoes by Eric Litwin     Pete the Cat was a huge hit last year, so I segued into stories with cats by reintroducing Pete to the kiddos. They really enjoyed seeing Pete do all of the school activities that they do when they are at school.Fingerplay: \"Two Little Kitties\"Five Little KittiesFive little kitties in a rowextend five fingersThey nod their heads to the children so.bend fingers toward audienceThey run to the left, they run to the right;move hand in each directionThey stand up straight to reach the sunlightraise handOne little puppy, he's in for some fun;raise a finger on the other hand\"MEOW!\" See those kitties run!have dog chase catsStory: Pete the Cat and His Four Groovy Buttons by Eric Litwin     This is my favorite Pete the Cat story, primarily for the great message--buttons come and buttons go!--as well as the fantastic song. Whenever I've shared this book, kids get really into the rhythm of it. It's great to support basic math skills, too.Story: This Is Not My Hat by Jon Klassen     Klassen's I Want My Hat Back, with its open-endedness and dark humor, was one of my favorite books of 2011, so I was anxiously awaiting the release of This Is Not My Hat. If it's possible, I like this second title even more. It opens with a small fish confessing to having stolen a larger fish's hat; he knows stealing is wrong, but he wants it, so he has a plan to escape to a patch of seaweeds. As the small fish narrates, the illustrations often negate what he says: for example, when the small fish says the large fish he stole from probably won't notice his hat is missing, we see the large fish looking up to where his hat should be. The resolution is again darkly funny yet open-ended--let me know what ending you think happens.Song: \"If You're Happy and You Know It\" + ukulele     I have managed to master this song on my ukulele--well, \"master\" might be a strong word. At any rate, I accompanied our usual story time closing song with my ukulele, introducing the kiddos to the instrument and inviting them to say its name. We adapted the actions in the song to fit our story time theme: we sang verses of \"If you're happy and you know it, be a dog\" (with lots of barking) as well as \"...be a cat\" and \"...be a fish.\" We ended the whole song with \"If you're happy and you know it, wave goodbye,\" which perfectly signaled the end of our story time. I got lots of enthusiastic comments about the ukulele, and I will absolutely be working to learning more songs to share at my outreach visits."},

{"title": null, "date": "Friday, October 12, 2012", "text": "...is to talk about butts. I put this theory to the test during summer reading rallies last May, when I visited elementary schools to talk about our summer reading program and to book talk a few titles. I was able to command the attention of a school of 500+ whenever I talked about state award nominee Pierre the Penguin for one simple reason: I said that, unfortunately, this particular penguin had no butt feathers. That's right, I said \"butt.\" And those readers were sold.That's why I love what Artie Bennett is doing with picture book non-fiction. He is meeting young readers where they are, talking about real giggle-inducing topics like butts and poop. And while those topics in and of themselves grab young readers' attention, the content of each book is interesting and informative.The Butt Book came out in 2010, and it takes readers through the fascinating world of derrieres. Throughout the rhymed text, we learn a lot about butts: what they are called in other parts of the world; that snakes don't have them; the number of things we can do only because we have butts. Mike Lester's bright and comical illustrations add another dimension of delight to the thoroughly enjoyable book.Bennett's most recent endeavor is titled Poopendous! Can you guess its subject matter? With the help of Professor Pip Poopdeck, readers learn a myriad of facts about feces. We learn different names for different types of poop, the fact that different animals produce different shapes of poop (it's cubes from wombats--who knew?!?), and--perhaps most excitingly--the diverse uses for poop: fertilizer, building material, animal identification. Bennett shares all sorts of tidbits about poop that are sure to stick with kids long after their giggles have died down. Mike Moran's cartoon-y illustrations only make the whole book more fun.Both The Butt Book and Poopendous! share a remarkable amount of information in a format that absolutely captivates young readers. Bennett's use of rhyme is excellent; his stanzas flow and exude joviality in a manner that few writers since Dr. Seuss have truly mastered. Simply put, these books are a joy. Even better for teachers, librarians, and caregivers: they inform as well as entertain. I'm willing to bet these books will be a hit with almost any crowd you encounter.P.S. Artie Bennett seems like a really awesome, hilarious guy. Mr. Schu interviewed him this summer; head over to Watch. Connect. Read. to see what he had to say."},
{"title": null, "date": "Wednesday, October 10, 2012", "text": "For this week's Bouncing Babies story time, I had just one child registered for my 11 o'clock session: a 5-week-old boy. A year ago, I might have been intimidated by the prospect of a baby story time consisting of only me, the mom, and a mostly-sleeping tiny baby. Instead, I took a deep breath, dug into my book basket for some age-appropriate books to share, and got down to business.My basic Bouncing Babies program format is easily adaptable for the tiniest library visitors. I try to work a variety of rhymes and songs into every session, many of which work just as well for rocking a baby as for engaging a 20-month-old in fine motor skills. I did decide early on to scrap the interactive music and free play portions of the program for this particular program scenario; I didn't see loud bells or tactile balls going over too well with a drowsy newborn. Instead, I focused more heavily on book sharing after our rhymes. Even with a lightly sleeping baby, rhyming and rhythmic stories, as well as sung stories, are calming and comforting. I chose three from my book basket: Itsy Bitsy Spider, a pop-up book from Richard Egielski, which I sang slowly and quietly; Baby Cakes, written by Karma Wilson and illustrated by Sam Williams, which has great, simple rhythm and invites cuddling; and Sleepy Me! by Marni McGee and illustrated by Cee Biscoe, which has plenty of happy-sounding, calming rhymes. I read the books as I would to any audience of babies--only in this case, since the baby was dozing, my audience was being rocked in mamma's arms during my reading. The whole atmosphere felt calm, inviting, and pleasant. I would venture to guess that such an atmosphere is appreciated by the mother of a 5-week-old.Perhaps one of the best things about a program with low attendance--in this case, just one caregiver and child!--is the fact that the attendees have your total attention. I love being able to tailor my program format to my audience, and I always take the opportunity to share an early literacy message specific to the child. In this instance, I emphasized the great impact songs and rhymes have on even the tiniest pre-readers. The mom and I chatted briefly about calming songs, fun rhymes and rhyming stories, and ways to promote bonding when sharing these songs and rhymes with the baby (rocking, eye contact, speaking softly and directly to the child, etc.). After securing her sleeping baby in his carrier, the mom left with some practical ideas for at-home activities as well as excitement to come back to future programs. What could have been a difficult or awkward program with a tiny library patron turned into one of my favorite program interactions yet.Have you ever done a program for just a few really tiny library visitors? What did you do? How did it go?"},
{"title": null, "date": "Monday, October 8, 2012", "text": "I think it is safe to say that superheroes have been of lots of folks' minds as of late. What with all of the big-budget superhero movies hitting theaters over the summer, the variety of superhero graphic novels coming out for early and middle grade readers, and increased interest in making superhero-themed picture books for the younger set, there seems to be large interest in all things superheroes. As a librarian, I want to consistently use my powers for good--and that recently meant offering a Superhero Party program. Here's what it looked like:As children made their way into the program room, they saw tables set out with supplies to create their superhero costumes: blank face masks from our die cut machine; toilet paper tubes to be decorated and cut into wrist bands; and name tags ready to proclaim each child's superhero name. We spent a good twenty minutes in costume preparation--and let me tell you, the creative juices were flowing big time! I made sure to walk the room and engage each child in a conversation about his/her superpowers, costume choice, etc. Also, since the program began with our craft--a quieter activity--I was able to leave the program room doors open for the first twenty minutes. I had a handful of children come into the room for the program just because they peeked in and saw something they found interesting. I love getting walk-ins at school-age programs.As children were putting the finishing touches on their costumes, I took the opportunity to talk about a few books in the collection featuring superheroes they might not have been familiar with. For the younger set, I book talked Wedgieman: A Hero is Born by Charise Mericle Harper and illustrated by Bob Shea. For older readers, I talked both a graphic novel series and a chapter book series: Lunch Lady by Jarrett Krosoczka, and The Adventures of Captain Underpants by Dav Pilkey (complete with flip-o-rama demonstration).After the book talks and a quick superhero photo break, we moved into our superhero skills training. Two games were available for our young heroes, both involving tossing balls. First was a knock-over-the-supervillains game, similar to what you might see at a school fun fair. I affixed some common comic book villains to the cans, and we used textured rubber balls as ammunition. The second game involved knocking some invisible villains out of a building--a.k.a. a large box I carved window-like sections out of and then painted. The ammunition for this game was soft spongy balls that are designed as pool toys. After hearing about the invisible villains, a few children modified their costumes with special invisibility-viewing capabilities. I love the young child's mind!After a few rounds of skill practice, it was time for our final superhero endeavor: ridding the library of a deadly kryptonite contamination. *GASP!* For this game, we split into two teams. The kryptonite--balled up pieces of aluminum foil--was scattered around the far end of the program room, and the kryptonite could only be picked up with the assistance of two pencils--no touching the kryptonite! The goal was for each team to send one member at a time from their home base, where they had a decontamination bucket, into the contamination field to pick up and carry back a piece of kryptonite using their tools. Once the piece of kryptonite was deposited in the decontamination bucket, another team member could go to continue the collection. At the end of the game, the team with the most kryptonite collected would win. Since our attendees were toward the younger side of the school-age range, their pace for collecting kryptonite was not particularly quick; to help move things along, I let teams have multiple members out in the contamination field at a time.Once all the kryptonite had been cleared, I reported that I, The Librarian, would need to count the kryptonite to determine the winning team. I suggested that they pass the tallying time by looking at the superhero books available for check-out--I had set up a table with a variety of options. Note: almost every book was checked out after the program; since they were looking at books as part of the program time, they were a captive audience and really looked at their options. When finally I announced that one team had edged out the other with a single piece of kryptonite, everyone was happy and had a book in hand.The children walked out into the library in their superhero costumes after the program, and I made sure they left with my favorite superhero message as well as a book: use your powers for good. Based on the number of smiles on those masked faces, I'd say the whole event was a success."},
{"title": null, "date": "Friday, October 5, 2012", "text": "Corey visited my library in May.Today, for a special Banned Books Week edition of YA Friday--it's young adult author John Corey Whaley!His coming-of-age novel Where Things Come Back was awarded the 2012 Michael L. Printz Award for Excellence in Young Adult Literature and the 2012 William C. Morris YA Debut Award. These are major literary accolades, but they have not made his novel immune to the challenges aimed at so many young adult books. I asked Corey--that's how he introduced himself at his book event at my library last May--a few questions about the freedom to read. Without further ado, here's what he had to say:What does the freedom to read mean to you as a YA author?Corey: The freedom to read has always been something I refuse to take lightly. When I first discovered, around 8th grade, that some books were banned around the world, in certain schools, and at different points in history, I immediately knew that I couldn't take my freedoms for granted and that I had the obligation to treat reading with the utmost respect. Being a YA author has only strengthened that emotion in me--I've seen first hand how easily and haphazardly a book can be misinterpreted or mis-categorized, how quickly a small group of people can try to take that freedom away from our young people. My first and most important mission as an author for teens is to be obsessed with the truth---to find new and creative ways to tell stories that, whether real or not, have some universal, meaningful truth that teenage readers can not only relate to, but through which they can also find comfort and understanding. The freedom to read is equal to the freedom to learn and to grow as a person, and those mean more to me than anything.You taught middle and high school English. How did teaching young adults affect your perspective on censorship and the freedom to read?Corey: There were several moments in my career as a teacher when I had to ask myself some very important questions. \"Should my students be reading this?\" \"Should I skip over this section?\" \"Should I censor this author's words so I don't cause any trouble or offend anyone?\" And, to tell you the truth, I probably made a few bad decisions and a few good ones along the way. It's a difficult thing, to judge for someone else what they can and can't handle, the things that their respective lives and upbringings make them sensitive to and so forth. I'd say my perspective was most affected when I realized, as a high school teacher, that a history teacher had been giving misinformation to my students and treating it as fact. She hadn't given them the option to question her, but had told them a lie and used her authority to make it their truth. So, I re-taught them the lesson in my English class...I let them know that they have to be careful who they get certain information from and why certain people, even figures of authority, don't always have all the answers. Maybe I digressed a bit there, but this experience led me to look at my role as a teacher in a new light--it made me realize that above all else, it was my duty to give my students the truth, be it difficult or not. So, I'd say teaching had a grandiose affect on the way I view censorship and the freedom to read and learn, even when certain truths make us uncomfortable.What are some of your favorite frequently challenged or banned books?Corey: Ah!  There are SO many. Some of my favorites are definitely The Catcher in the Rye, Fahrenheit 451, To Kill a Mockingbird, The Perks of Being a Wallflower. These books changed the way I viewed literature as a young adult, and it pains me to think that other teens are blocked access from experiencing them.What advice would you give teens whose parents or teachers tell them a book they want to read is off-limits for being \"inappropriate\"?Corey: Great question. I've never been a parent, but my years as a teacher instilled in me that, first and foremost, it is a parent's job to protect and look after his or her child and make the tough decisions that affect that child. But, I also think that if teens disagree with their parents on certain books being \"inappropriate,\" then they should perhaps use this disagreement as an opportunity to open up a dialogue with their parents. Teens could challenge their parents to read a book along with them, to discuss the difficult, possibly inappropriate topics and actually use this as a way to learn more about the harsh realities of the adult world. I think, if parents are open to it, this could actually be a very open and honest way of connecting with their children and, most assuredly, a way to learn a little something themselves.~*~Thank you, Corey, for sharing your perspective on the freedom to read. As a librarian who often fields questions from parents about whether this book or that book is \"appropriate\" for their children, I'm glad to hear at least one other person thinks that difficult or controversial stories can provide opportunities for discussion when read together.Readers, celebrate your freedom to read and look for Corey's award-winning novel Where Things Come Back at a library or independent bookstore near you!"},

I love the sense of camaraderie it creates in the library--all sorts of customers stop to look at the display of library books that have been challenged or banned at some point somewhere in the country. More often than not, they recognize many of the books on the display as some of their favorites. \"Why would someone have challenged/banned this book?\" they ask; \"It's so good!\" Personally, I agree: many of my favorite reads happen to have been challenged or banned at one time or another. Go ahead, look at the lists of frequently challenged books; I'd bet you'll find some of your favorites there, too.Our Banned Books WeekdisplayMy library wholeheartedly stands behind the Freedom to Read Statement, and I am adamant that the statement applies to children and teens as much as it does to adults. Sure, it is still up to the parents or guardians to decide if a book is appropriate for their own children; but it is certainly not the place of the library to say what someone can or cannot read. I also like to consider something that Daniel Handler mentioned at ALA Annual this past June: while many great books may include moments of sex, rude language, diverse lifestyles, or any other number of things an individual may find objectionable, it is not those moments that make the book great. In fact, many young readers remember loving a book without ever really recalling those \"objectionable\" bits. They like these books because they are good books. End of argument.And so I always make an effort to provide access to these fabulous books that have been challenged or banned--not because I think the lure of something racy will catch readers (although it sometimes does snare the reluctant ones)--but because I will go to any lengths to get great books in the hands of readers. If that means wrapping books with signage containing modified lyrics to one of the year's most maddening songs, well, so be it. Anything for a reader to fall in love with a beautiful story.How do you celebrate Banned Books Week in your library? What are your favorite challenged or banned books?

{"title": null, "date": "Friday, September 28, 2012", "text": "Have you heard about CoderDojo, a movement to get more kids involved in programming? There's been some talk about CoderDojo and programming in general in libraries recently, and I like the whole idea of getting children and teens interested in and knowledgeable about programming--especially since so much of their world is now supported by behind-the-scenes programming. Thus I was interested when No Starch Press offered to send me a copy of their book Super Scratch Programming Adventure! to peruse and review.Super Scratch Programming Adventure! by the LEAD Project introduces readers to computer programming in the form of Scratch, a programming language created by a group at MIT. Scratch is downloadable for free, and its design is graphic in nature--it should help programmers of any age visually see the way programs are written and the logic behind them. The book is a combination of two parts: a framing story in graphic novel format; and individual stages, or exercises, in learning to program with Scratch. Each exercise encourages the programmer to create a real, playable game. While these games are simple, they are dynamic and will make their creators proud.The style of instruction is straightforward and accessible, and the games that the reader creates as exercises provide plenty of opportunities for experimenting with Scratch. Everything is very bright and visual--both the book and Scratch itself--which may make programming much easier to learn for visual thinkers. The book is not a stand-alone resource; access to a computer with the capability to run Scratch 1.4, which is available to download for free, is necessary. Thus this book is not a stand-alone resource, but it has the potential to be a great tool for teaching and engaging kids in computer programming.For most children, Super Scratch Programming Adventure! will likely be most successful when used under the guidance of a regular instructor, i.e., in a classroom setting, where they can ask questions of someone with computer programming experience. That said, children who are motivated to understand the logic and mechanics behind the videogames they play will find the book and its exercises engaging on their own. I can also see this book and Scratch being useful to scouting groups who are working toward a computer badge. Libraries with computers specifically for children or with CoderDojo-style programs will likely find this book a useful resource as well.Super Scratch Programming Adventure! is available as both print book and downloadable ebook; the print copy comes with the ebook included.

It can be difficult to condense all of the information of the conference into reasonably-sized nuggets, and then to prioritize when and how those nuggets will start to appear in the library. I manage in a few ways. First, I tend to speak out loud about all of the ideas bouncing around in my head; something about verbalizing my thoughts aloud allows me to make more sense of them. Second, I make lists. Shocking, I know.I want to share with you, as a means of sharing with myself, a list of the ideas I hope to put into action following the 2012 ALSC National Institute. Keep in mind this is a preliminary list of goals--I'm sure more ideas will manifest as I'm reminded of conference programs over the coming months.Goal #1: Intentionality.     If #ALSC12 had a buzzword, it was \"intentionality.\" Lots of the programs and conversations left me thinking that library services should be more intentional. What are we doing? Why are we doing it? Asking these questions about every aspect of the services we provide will help us pare down what is giving little value for the time it takes, and it will help us beef up our excellent services. Intentionality means knowing the reasons for doing what you do--how it helps a child developmentally, how it offers opportunities for social interaction or play, etc. I want to get my staff thinking about these questions with regard to their programs, and I also want them to consider how well we are doing at helping children of all ages achieve their developmental assets. I'm not asking for sweeping changes. I'm asking for us to offer the very best because we know what the best is.Goal #2: Make meaningful additions to our current programming.     This goal absolutely ties in with the goal of intentionality, although here it is less abstract. I left the Institute with some definite ideas about concrete modifications to our current programs. Five big ones come to mind:Make measurement a part of story time. One presenter talked about how a program that initially talked about measurement as an aside turned into a full-blown measuring-tape extravaganza once the kiddos got their hands on measuring tools. What better way to engage with the world around you than to seek to identify its qualities?Use realia in story times. Seeing real life objects that correspond with a story or theme help children create a firm foundation for understanding the world they inhabit.Be more systematic about sharing early literacy tips. Saroj Ghoting advocates writing short (no more than 30 seconds) early literacy tips on sticky notes, then sticking these notes to the back covers of story time books. When you hold the book to read during story time, you'll be reminded to share the tip with caregivers.Add more instruments and props. Egg shakers and rhythm sticks. Parachutes and bean bags. All of these elements were recommended as means of adding more song and movement to story times, and while that impetus is extremely worthwhile in and of itself, the enjoyment children will get from really interacting in story time will be the icing on the cake.Learn caregivers' names. After you learn the names of the children who come to your programs, learn the names of the grown-ups who bring them there. This practice will create a community within the program while also holding the caregiver accountable for continuing learning outside of the program.Goal #3: Add some new programming in the not-too-distant future.     In particular I want to think about adding book apps to my programs. I also want to ponder debuting a Mock Newbery program in conjunction with local schools. My ideas in these two realms are varied and disjointed at this point, and I know I need more time to sit and think about what these initiatives might look like. Do you have a program along these lines that works? Let me know!Goal #4: Foster joyful reading.     I mentioned in my post from the Institute that author/illustrator Peter Brown made a statement that really struck me: \"Joyful reading is the answer to all problems.\" This statement has resonated in my brain, turning into a mantra of sorts. Joyful reading. Joyful reading. How do we foster joyful reading in our library customers of all ages? To me, \"joyful reading\" means taking joy in the act of reading as much as in the stories themselves. Joyful reading is about the feeling of fulfillment and enrichment that comes from reading something meaningful. I must remember that what is meaningful to me won't necessarily be meaningful to you, and vice versa. So how do we reach all readers?     One of my goals is to foster joyful reading wherever I can. I will tell stories and read stories joyfully, I will recommend them joyfully, and I will make every attempt at joyfully displaying and promoting them within the library and in the community. I really think we'll all be better for it.~*~I'd love for you to weigh in with your thoughts on my goals, or things you've learned at conferences, or anything else that might be on your mind. What are you putting into action in your library?"},
{"title": null, "date": "Monday, September 24, 2012", "text": "Current and former preschoolerscelebrate together.One of the preschools I visit regularly to provide outreach story times contacted me last month to share some news: they were throwing a party to celebrate their 25th anniversary as a preschool, and I was invited! Woo, a party! Who doesn't love a party? Of course I said I'd be there, and I happily agreed to bring some stories for the activities portion of the day.There was a lot to capture kids' attention following birthday song and the cutting (and gobbling) of the birthday cake. There was a clown making balloon animals, face painting, a bounce house--the fire department even brought a fire truck to the parking lot for the occasion. With all that stimulation, kids moved from station to station as they pleased. Lots seemed quite happy to have a semi-quiet story time area where they could relax and enjoy some popsicles.Since kids were moving in and out of my story time area, I had some books propped up in front of me so kids could choose the stories they wanted to hear. Familiarity and silliness seem to be key in choosing stories for an informal story time, as the big hits were Five Little Monkeys Jumping on the Bed by Eileen Christelow, Duck! Rabbit! by Amy Krouse Rosenthal, and I Am Invited to a Party! by Mo Willems. All these stories make sense to young children even if they arrive in the middle of a telling. They also all boast interactive read-aloud options: kids can use their fingers to tell about those jumping monkeys, and the reader can ask for opinions on what that creature looks like and what kids might wear to various types of parties.Perhaps my favorite aspect of this story time party was my getting to introduce my new story time tool: a ukulele! It arrived in the mail last week, and so far I've mastered \"If You're Happy and You Know It\"--which, thankfully, can be adapted and stretched out in a myriad of ways. At the party, we sang it the traditional way as well as with animal noises; kids got really involved, as I asked them to supply the names of animals they wanted to sound like in each verse. We were rockin'!I may not have had kids lined up by my station like the face painters or balloon animal-making clown, but all the kids I did interact with were all smiles. That's what I call a fun party!"},

I'll be in Indianapolis through Saturday for the 2012 ALSC National Institute--three days of all sorts of sessions aimed at those of us who serve children in our libraries, plus plenty of networking and author excitement. I'll be one of several attendees live-blogging all the great things going on at the Institute, so make sure you check out the ALSC Blog to stay on top of all that's happening in Indy. You can also follow #ALSC12 on Twitter to keep up with the chatter. I'll try to post some highlights here, too, but time and internet access will factor into whether that happens.And now for some reading updates! You may have noticed that there haven't been many chapter book reviews on the blog lately. That absence is not due to lack of reading, I assure you--on the contrary, it's due to large amounts of reading due to two committee appointments:I was named a Round I panelist for the Cybils Awards in the middle grade fiction category! Reading hasn't yet begun for this appointment--book nominations don't even begin until Oct. 1 (start thinking of what titles you want to recommend!)--but I'm gearing up for what will surely be a very large stack of to-read books on my kitchen table.I've been working my way through the 2013-2014 Mark Twain Award Preliminary Nominees as part of my reader/selector duties. That's 25 novels aimed at 4th-6th graders, and I'm happy to say that the genres and appeal factors run the gamut. I've really been enjoying reading these middle grade novels.That's what I'm doing these days in addition to all the fun programming and collection management at my branch. Stay tuned to the blog in the next few weeks for some exciting program ideas as well as a celebration of one of my favorite weeks of the year: Banned Books Week! I may even have a surprise up my sleeve to help celebrate the freedom to read...I hope to see many of you in Indy!"},
{"title": null, "date": "Monday, September 17, 2012", "text": "I love starting a new season of outreach in September. The children I visit at daycares and preschools are fully of energy and the joy of school in September, and they are pumped to have someone come to read stories to them. I also love the beginning of fall outreach because it coincides with the start of the Missouri Building Block Picture Book Award voting period. Each year from September 1-December 31, any child who reads at least five of the 10 nominated books is eligible to vote for his or her favorite. I read two or three Building Block books at each monthly fall outreach story time, so my frequently-visited preschools get to vote in December. This past week I started things off with three great 2012 Building Block nominees, plus a former nominee that always proves a hit. Add in some rhymes and songs and you're set!September Outreach Story TimeOpening Song: \"Open, Shut Them\"Story: If You're Hoppy by April Pulley Sayre, illus. by Jackie Urbanovic     Even the youngest preschool-goers are familiar with the song \"If You're Happy and You Know It,\" so this animal-centered adaptation is always a welcome treat. Children get to meet a variety of hoppy, sloppy, growly, and flappy animals in this bright, fun read. I read the words musically so kids recognize the tune, and they love getting involved with the actions in the story.Fingerplay: \"This is the Bunny\"This is the bunny with ears so funnyhold up two fingers for bunny earsAnd here is his hole in the ground.make a ring with other handWhen a sound he hears, he pricks up his earswiggle then straighten your bunny earsAnd jumps into his hole in the ground.put the bunny ears in your ringed handStory: Do You Know Which Ones Will Grow? by Susan A. Shay, illus. by Tom Slaughter     This colorful, rhymed book gets great reactions from children of all ages. The youngest ones watch carefully as flaps lift to show things that do not grow (e.g., sweaters, cars). Slightly older children emphatically supply \"yes\" or \"no\" answers to the questions of which things grow, and the oldest preschool children try to finish all of the rhymes in the text. This book also includes great vocabulary--it mentions that young owls are owlets, young cows are calves, and young foxes are kits. The animal-loving readers really got into these words. I love finding books that will engage and appeal to a wide range of ages.Fingerplay: \"Five Fat Peas\"Five fat peas, in a pod pressedshow five fingers, then ball into a fistOne grew, two grew, so did all the rest.lift fingers for growing peasThey grew and they grew and they did not stopwith hands together, slowly move hands apartUntil one day that pea pod POPPED!move hands apart and clap on \"POPPED\"Story: I Spy With My Little Eye by Edward Gibbs     This story is another great read for a wide age range. A hole in each page lets kids \"spy\" what is on the next page. For clues to guess the animal they are spying, they have the animal's color as well as the animal's short description (think \"long trunk\" for elephant). I like to encourage kids to get out their spyglasses to read this story--and before I know it everyone is peering at the book through spyglass hands. There is a lot of great vocabulary in this read, too, whether your audience is just starting to learn colors or is learning about wild animals.Puppet Rhyme: \"Five Little Monkeys Swinging in a Tree\"     Seems like all preschoolers are familiar with the variety of \"Five Little Monkeys\" rhymes. Which is not to say that they tire of reciting them--no, no, much to the contrary, they love chanting along to something they know. I bring my alligator puppet with my Eileen Christelow finger puppet monkeys when I take this rhyme on the road, and the whole room always erupts in giggles when Mr. Alligator snatches those monkeys for a snack.Story: The Perfect Nest by Catherine Friend, illus. by John Manders     Jack the cat is trying to set a trap that will give him some eggs to make omelets. After a chicken, a duck, and a goose all lay an egg in this perfect nest, however, things don't go quite as Jack planned. Children love the voices and foreign words written into the text--these are some silly fowl, people--and the story develops at a pace that really keeps their attention. The story also ends on a calm, quiet note, which is great for signaling the end of story time.Closing Song: \"If You're Happy and You Know It\"     We read a book based on this song, so why not finish our story time with the original version, plus a few funny animal motions mixed in? I find this song always leaves groups in a good mood--perhaps it has something to do with the fact that it encourages them to shout in school?~*~That's three Building Block nominees down so far for this fall's outreach visits. I'll be visiting a few more preschools and daycares with this story time before the end of the month, and then it's on to a new batch of stories for October!"},
{"title": null, "date": "Friday, September 14, 2012", "text": "A major talking point of the Common Core Standards is its emphasis on non-fiction texts for all readers. In the fourth grade, according to the standards, a child should be reading a 50% fiction and 50% non-fiction (literature classes still focus on fiction, and non-fiction comes into play in science and social studies). As a librarian, I see wonderful potential in this recommendation. There is a lot of really wonderful, quality non-fiction out there, and it doesn't always get the attention or reader enjoyment that it deserves. Publishers are responding to the Common Core Standards, though, by making great non-fiction available for readers at all levels. Here's a look at three terrific non-fiction picture books that will be released in the coming months.Spinner, Stephanie. Alex the Parrot: No Ordinary Bird. illus. by Meilo So. Alfred A. Knoft BFYR. 9 Oct. 2012. p. 48.     When graduate student Irene Pepperberg purchased an African grey parrot from a pet store in the late 1970s, scientists were just starting to consider the idea that animals might have intelligence. Pepperberg named her new bird Alex, and she began to try to teach him to speak--African greys had been long known for their ability to mimic sounds they hear, but Pepperberg wanted to show that they could use sounds deliberately. Alex did indeed learn, and pretty soon his vocabulary and sentence construction skills were similar to those of many preschoolers. Alex the Parrot introduces readers to an extraordinary bird who, with the help of his devoted scientist friend, helped to expand research into animal intelligence beyond primates. The text is divided into five short chapters and is accompanied by lovely, colorful illustrations. This book would fit well in a unit on birds, science, or learning.Watson, Renee. Harlem's Little Blackbird: The Story of Florence Mills. illus. by Christian Robinson. Random House BFYR. 23 Oct. 2012. p. 40.     Florence Mills grew up with little, the daughter of former slaves in a \"teeny-tiny, itsy-bitsy\" house outside of Washington, D.C. Her life was rich with song and music, however, and young Mills had a voice that would take her to sing in New York City and London. Mills became a star of the Harlem Renaissance not only for her remarkable voice, but for her devotion to equal rights as well. With every new personal accomplishment, Florence remained mindful of others--the poor, the sick, and the oppressed--and when she died young, she was honored and remembered by thousands. Watson's text has a great rhythm to it to mirror Mills, and Robinson's illustrations are bright and beautiful. This book will make a great addition to units on music, biography, and equal rights.Bryant, Jen. A Splash of Red: The Life and Art of Horace Pippin. illus. by Melissa Sweet. Alfred A. Knopf BFYR. 8 Jan. 2013. p. 40.     Horace Pippin took pleasure in drawing and painting pictures from a young age, but Pippin set aside that enjoyment  to focus his efforts on earning money for his family and, later, fighting in WWI. After a war injury left him with limited use of his dominant right hand, Pippin returned to the states to marry and try to work odd jobs. Upon finally picking up an artistic implement again, however, Pippin found that not only was making art therapeutic--both physically and mentally--but he was good at it, too. With simple prose and beautiful illustrations, A Splash of Red tells the uplifting history of a man who was celebrated for the honesty and expressiveness in his artwork. This book will support units on art, biography, WWI, and equal rights."},

{"title": null, "date": "Wednesday, September 12, 2012", "text": "My \"map\" of signs to include, the caregiver handout,and our songs & rhymes sheets with relevant ASL signs.I always end my Bouncing Babies programs with about twenty minutes of free play time, during which time I mostly interact with the little ones and overhear caregivers swapping stories. I've overheard discussion of nap schedules, long car rides with a toddler, and other topics that don't immediately impact me, a single childless librarian. But over the last few weeks, I noticed another frequent topic: sign language and babies. When I hear something like that, especially when multiple caregivers bring it up, I take notice.This week marked the first time I added some simple American Sign Language (ASL) signs to my Bouncing Babies programs. My approach, at least for now, is twofold. First, I have a handout with nine simple signs that might come into \"conversation\" between child and caregiver (e.g., please, thank you, mom, dad); every grown-up program attendee gets a copy of this handout with the day's songs & rhymes sheet. I use these signs throughout the program if I say the relevant words, but I don't formally present or teach them. My rationale is that caregivers can take these handouts home and start to add these signs to their personal routines if they so desire.In addition to having that handout with nine simple signs, I have also added one program-relevant sign to the songs and rhymes portion of the program. This week we did a rhyme about a little bird, so as a group we learned the sign for \"bird.\" I encourage caregivers to use the sign themselves, and I also encourage their helping their children to make the sign, too, if the child is agreeable (i.e., not running around the room, or at least a few months old). At the very least, I figure this exercise reinforces fine motor skills, but caregivers were getting really into showing the sign and saying the word to their children.The rest of my program format is the same--the only addition is using the appropriate sign when I say something is good or tell participants thank you for coming. A few disclaimers: I point out that ASL is a robust language in and of itself, and that we are only using a few simple signs; I also mention that I am not an expert, having only looked up the signs I thought would be relevant to young children (see my brainstorm word map, in yellow in the photo). So far caregivers seem happy with the inclusion of simple signs into the Bouncing Babies program, and I look forward to seeing how I can refine its use in programming over the next several months.How do you incorporate signing into programs at your library, either for little ones or for older children?"},
{"title": null, "date": "Monday, September 10, 2012", "text": "The assortment of things shown below this paragraph may look to you like nothing but space junk. Last week at the library, however, these random recycled bits made up our craft supplies for Art Attacks! The scenario: aliens are landing at the library. The mission: use the materials on hand to create models of aliens.After my brief introduction of the scenario, the open art time began. School-age children and a few younger siblings scoured the supply tables to find the perfect pieces for their alien creations. Most of the craft supplies were recycled things--tin cans, plastic bottle caps, film canisters, and the like. There's this little shop in my county called Leftovers, and they have rows and rows of donated recycled things that are perfect for craft supplies; a brown paper grocery sack full of items is $8. I added some chenille sticks, pom poms, and googly eyes from our library craft cupboard, and then the alien parts tables were ready.Attendees spent about 45 minutes assembling their various aliens. Craft glue didn't work on all of the materials, so a teen volunteer and I broke out the hot glue guns--that did the trick. Pretty soon aliens were taking shape left and right, with some children making multiple specimens while others focused their full attention on a single creature.I noticed that the kiddos were putting the finishing touches on their creatures with about 10 minutes still left in the program--and not wanting the program to go short when everyone was so engrossed, I asked everyone to sit in a circle with their creations. The children introduced their alien/s, and then I started asking some broad questions about the aliens' anatomies. How did the aliens move around? Did they have feet? Most did, but two hovered without feet. How did the aliens navigate the world around them? All the creatures had eyes (such is the appeal of googly eyes in craft programs), but there were only a smattering of noses and ears.What ensued for the final few minutes of our program, then, was a discussion about how body parts have functions--and by looking at what parts make up a creature like a dolphin or a cat or even an alien, you can tell things about how and where that creature lives. Through this discussion, we \"discovered\" that all our aliens came from only two planets: one where sound was very faint so the creatures' ears needed to be large or antenna-like, and one similar to Earth but with more hovering. And that's how this simple, labor-light program ended up having a really strong science bent. Not only did children create aliens, they got to reason through why their aliens looked the way they did.Art Attacks! turned out to be a full-blown STEAM program--STEM plus \"A\" for arts--a term I first heard at ALA Annual in Anaheim. After seeing the huge success of this program, I'm going to think about more ways I can deliberately incorporate free art/creation time with simple STEM concepts in order to offer more STEAM programs at my branch."},
{"title": null, "date": "Friday, September 7, 2012", "text": "When you think about readers' advisory, what comes to mind? Is it gratifying discussions about books at the reference desk? Informal resources like genre lists and theme bookmarks? Those methods of suggesting titles to read are great, but they don't necessarily meet the needs of all our customers. What about those customers who don't want to talk, and who don't want to work through a list to find their next book? How do we get great books into their hands without violating their level of comfort at the library?It may seem vain, but here's what I'm trying: a one-book display at the check-out desk called \"Miss Amy Recommends.\"I've been at my library for over a year now, and while that is by no means a long time, I have noticed that customers have gotten to know who I am. Especially those customers with children. That's Miss Amy, she came to my school! or Miss Amy did that airplane program I went to--those are things I'll overhear as children let their parents know who I am. So that's reason 1 of my rationalization: library folks know who this Miss Amy person is.Reason 2 stems from something that occurred several times this summer. While I was interacting with summer reading participants, I had several regular library visitors start to ask what I was reading. I'd explain a bit about the books I had currently read, and more often than not the child would ask if he or she could check out the book I mentioned. Whatever their reasons may be, some kids want to read what the kidlit-reading grown-ups in their lives are reading.Reason 3 is that this display is so very simple. It's simple for customers, who need only look at the book, decide it looks interesting, and then check it out. This display is also really simple for staff. Since it's just one book at a time, it takes up minimal space. The \"Miss Amy Recommends\" bubbles were simple to make and are reusable. And the only criteria I use in selecting books to display is whether I would make an effort to hand-sell the title or not. Do I like it? Yes? Then it gets added to the small pile of books that will rotate onto the display as soon as the current book gets checked out. Easy peasy.I have noticed that picture books tend to be picked off the display faster than chapter books (with the exception of The Secret of the Fortune Wookiee, which was plucked from the display within two minutes of being placed on it). But one of the beauties of such a simple display is that I can replace a book that doesn't seem to be catching customers' eyes. I'm finding this display a great way to keep things fresh and moving while letting young customers and their caregivers know I've got their reading interests in mind."},
{"title": null, "date": "Wednesday, September 5, 2012", "text": "The second edition of Every Child Ready to Read® @ your library® has given librarians a new lexicon for empowering parents and caregivers to help their children get ready to read. We now focus on the five practices: talking, singing, reading, writing, and playing. These five practices, I am happy to say, are so easy to sell to parents and caregivers. And that's the point: ECRR is first and foremost an initiative for parents and caregivers, who are children's first and best teachers. As librarians, our goal is to model these pro-literacy practices for parents and caregivers at every opportunity.Last week my library district was fortunate to have the fabulous Christina Jones* visit our library to share some of her own in-library early literacy successes. Today I give you, with her permission, five of her suggestions for how you can boost the learning opportunities in the story times you already provide, thus upping their early literacy impact:Talking -- Talking gives children opportunities to hear and practice fluent speech. In a story time setting, adding talking means adding oral storytelling. Put down the book and tell some stories! Start with familiar folk and fairy tales, and use a flannelboard if it makes you more comfortable.Singing -- Sing! Sing at the beginning of story time, and again at the end! Sing in the middle! Singing slows down language and helps children hear the smaller sounds in words. It's also fun and repetitive, so children pick up on songs and make them their own. Plain rhymes are good, too, but singing really is the best. Always include songs.Reading -- Obviously you are already doing some reading in your story times. But what is it that you're usually reading? Look over your last few programs--did you read any picture book non-fiction? You should. Not only will it engage and entertain the children in your program, but it will also help them develop larger vocabularies for understanding and navigating the world around them.Writing -- This one is simple: blank page crafts. Leave plenty of room for creativity and expression in your story time crafts. That blank piece of paper can be the window looking down from the giant's castle in a Jack story time, a canvas for a map in a \"lost and found\" story time, or a myriad other things limited only by the child writing on it. Bonus: it requires no prep work.Playing -- Keep your program room open for a little while following your story time and provide a space for children to play. Grab some blocks, play food, rubber balls--anything, really, that gives children opportunities to engage in free, unstructured play. Children will have fun, act out their understanding of the world, and interact socially; caregivers will get some de-stressing time with their peers. Everyone wins!There you have it: five ways you can give your story times even more of an early literacy edge starting right away. I would love to hear what you do in your programs to model the best early literacy practices while ensuring children have a great time.*Christina has some mad credentials: she is a Children's Services Reference Librarian at Monroe County Public Library in Bloomington, IN, and she teaches courses for the Schools of Library and Information Science at IU and IUPUI. She balances her on-the-ground early literacy-in-action work with knowledge of the research in the field. Basically, she's an early literacy rockstar and you should give her recommendations serious consideration."},
{"title": null, "date": "Monday, September 3, 2012", "text": "Plenty of folks in youth librarianship advise their younger colleagues not to reinvent the wheel; if you've got a good set of programs and themes, stick with them. While I think this advice is good most of the time--stick with program formats you know work, with general topics that appeal to youth in your community, etc.--there is something to be said for changing things up. New programs and experiences keep everyone engaged at the library, both patrons and staff.On the flip side, coming up with a steady stream of new ideas for programming isn't the easiest thing in the world. Or, I should say, it isn't the easiest thing in the world for me--you may very well have a wealth of ideas 24/7. Luckily there are plenty of ways for folks like me to get program inspiration. Here are a few that I have found particularly helpful in spurring new programming at my branch:Other librarians' blogs. I always love to hear what folks who've working in the profession longer that I have have to say about what they do. They share ideas, successes, learning experiences, and suggestions for improving and adapting services. These folks can be the best programming support a youth librarian could ask for. My top three are Abby at Abby the Librarian, Melissa at Mel's Desk, and Marge at Tiny Tips for Library Fun.Wonderopolis. I firmly believe that the world could always use more wonder, and Wonderopolis operates under the same belief--plus they share details on all sorts of wonders with readers. A wonder every day, as a matter of fact. Wonderopolis posts are great sources of ideas and also great resources to flesh out ideas you already had. They're awesome.Mixing in Math. I am always striving to incorporate more math and science into my library services, and Mixing in Math is a great source of information and ideas for doing so. I get their monthly e-mail newsletter, so I can depend upon ideas getting to me even if I'm feeling too swamped to browse online.ALSC Blog. I began using the ALSC Blog for program ideas and professional advice long before I started writing for it. The community of library professionals who serve children is vast, and I love how ALSC serves as a collective brain. On the ALSC Blog, I can almost always get that spark of inspiration I need--and at the same time I can discover what crazy ideas worked for other libraries and begin to adapt them for my own branch.Podcasts. I listen to a lot of podcasts, and the variety of topics they cover usually gives me plenty of opportunity to find something applicable to the library and my kiddos. These aren't really children's podcasts, but the topics they cover are often relevant. I really enjoy Radiolab, Stuff You Missed In History Class, How to Do Everything, and 99% Invisible. Recently the best idea-sparkers have been science-related--space in particular. I've got some rocketry and astronomy ideas bouncing around in my brain, and I'm excited to see what they turn into.Pinterest. Obviously this list of go-to inspiration sites would be incomplete without Pinterest, which is a wellspring of all sorts of library-relevant info. Since I can easily become overwhelmed by the volume of ideas, however, I tend not to browse Pinterest but instead visit the site once I have a rough theme in mind--then I'll search the boards for activities and crafts that fit within that theme. I know folks who start here, though, and it totally works for them.So there you have it, my go-to sources for program inspiration. I'd love to hear what you do when you're planning you next round of programs and feel stumped. What sources do you turn to for inspiration?"},

And I tell you, friends, that is a good thing.Let me say from the get-go that I think it is extremely important to have toys available for children to interact with in the library. This philosophy applies to all child-utilized spaces in the library, both in programs and outside of them. As a result, I have toys available 24/7 in the children's area of my library.As result, the children's area is usually not quiet. That's not to say there is screaming--tantrums are actually rather few and far between, and very few children fight over toys. Instead, my staff and I hear great noises. Kid noises. Learning noises.Daddy! Look what I drew! A car!Children develop by interacting with the world around them, and one of my goals is to provide plenty of opportunities for positive interactions in the library. Lots of times these interactions are with books and stories and librarian-mediated activities, but other times the interactions happen when children find things to explore just by looking around them. Noise in the children's area is evidence that learning can and does take place at any moment in the library--early literacy skills are constantly developing and sharpening.Those happy noises of kids playing and enjoying themselves also betray the development of something else: a lifelong love of the library and the fun that can be had there. And if that's not worth an occasional outburst of the ABCs--sung preschool opera style, of course--then, well, you can shush me."},

{"title": null, "date": "Monday, August 27, 2012", "text": "Today marks the beginning of two story time program off-weeks in my branch. It's not unusual for us to have an off-week about once a month--that week off provides time for staff to regroup, recharge, and plan for the next three-week story time series. We're taking two full weeks off this time, though, for a number of reasons: summer reading was hectic and requires time to recover; we've got some early literacy trainings this week; and Labor Day closures affect the library's schedules. All good reasons to take a little break, I think.But just because library staff are living by a different schedule for these off-weeks doesn't mean that our customers are. How do you meet customer demand for librarian-mediated story times when you're giving your staff a much-needed rest? Enter the take-home story time kit, available for regular check-out during programming off-weeks.Every take-home story time kit I assemble includes two or three books loosely on a theme--think farm animals, things that go, princess stories, etc., whatever your kiddos are into. To top off the stories, I include a children's CD that includes music similar to what we might include in our traditional story times. These stacks of materials get bundled together and tied with a pretty bow. To finish off the whole appealing package, I add a bright label that gives the kit's theme and simple instructions: \"Take twenty minutes to read these books and listen to or sing songs on this CD with your child. Talk about the books' pictures and what happens in the stories. Draw a picture about the theme when you're done!\" Ta-da! Brief, simple instructions for an at-home story time.I love several things about these take-home story time kits. First, they meet some of the demands of our customers for programming during those weeks when we're taking breaks from traditional story time programs--there's never complete radio silence between customers and story time providers. Second, they emphasize the importance of having story times at home, be they formal or informal. Third, they entreat caregivers to engage in ECRR-recommended practices with their children without ever sounding pedagogical. Fourth, they are pretty quick to assemble. And lastly, they are so pretty! Don't you think they're pretty?Caregivers who frequent my branch enjoy knowing that they can rely on the library to equip them to provide literacy-positive activities for their young ones even when our program room doors are shut. And that's part of the whole goal, right? To empower readers and those who raise readers. My staff may be resting over the next two weeks, but the library kiddos are still very much engaged with stories."},

I'll likely be adding these three titles to the shelves this fall; they have great potential for children's enjoyment, read-aloud success, and classic story introduction.Ziefert, Harriet. The Princess and the Peas and Carrots. illus. by Travis Foster. Blue Apple Books. 9 Oct. 2012. p. 40.     Rosebud is a little girl who likes everything in her life just so: her bedroom, her outfits, her craft supplies, her Good Princess Rosebud costume, everything. Rosebud's preferences aren't always endearing, however, and after complaints about wrinkles in her socks, lumps in her oatmeal, and gravy touching her peas and carrots, her mother sends Rosebud--now Princess Fussy--to her room. After she throws a terrific tantrum, Rosebud calms down and gets some help from her parents in remaking her bed and finishing her supper. Her father tells her the story of The Princess and the Pea before bed (this fairy tale portion folds out of the book), and little Rosebud learns that to be a princess like the one in the story, she needs to stay calm and poised instead of throwing a fit when something isn't perfectly right. This story has great illustrations, and while it is likely a little too simplistic for many adults, the children they read it to will likely love it.Shireen, Nadia. Hey, Presto! illus. by the author. Alfred A. Knopf BFYR. 13 Nov. 2012. p. 32.     Presto and Monty are the best of friends, and Monty's smiling, garrulous personality combined with Presto's skills as a magician get them a show in a carnival. Monty lets the accolades and attention go to his head, however, and Presto gets fed up with his bossy friend and goes home. Only during his big televised magic event does Monty learn that not only can he not do magic without Presto--he doesn't want to do anything with his friend. This story, told with great vocabulary and lively illustrations, is a great look at sharing, humility, and friendship. I'll pair it with Silly Goose's Big Story for a light-hearted look at getting along with friends.Comden, Betty, Adolph Green, and Carolyn Leigh. Flying to Neverland with Peter Pan. illus. by Amy June Bates. Blue Apple Books. 27 Nov. 2012. p. 36.     The text of this lovely picture book comes from the stage musical Peter Pan; it uses a brief story introduction as well as the lyrics from two songs (\"I'm Flying\" and \"Never Never Land\") to tell the tale of the three Darling children meeting Peter and flying to Neverland with him. The illustrations are soft and enticing, rich with detail and movement as each spread demands. I'll use this picture book to introduce the story of Peter Pan and Neverland to young readers."},
{"title": null, "date": "Wednesday, August 22, 2012", "text": "It's finally cooling down to a reasonable summer temperature here, which means more and more families are taking advantage of the great St. Louis Zoo. I decided to use that activity to inform my August Evening Family Story Time. Since this program can have attendees across a wide age range, I like to choose books and/or themes that are easily adaptable--that way I'm not stuck with all two-year-old books when the crowd is all age six. My program audience ended up being on the younger side, so the program plan below is what I shared with them:Opening Song: \"Open, Shut Them\"Story: We've All Got Bellybuttons! by David Martin     I love the action options in this book. Starting a story time with an interactive story (stretching your neck, stomping your feet, having your bellybutton tickled by mom or dad...) always gets things off on the right foot.Song: \"The Elephants at the Zoo\"     This is a great interactive song to the tune of \"The Wheels on the Bus.\" I found it on Erin's fabulous Falling Flannelboards blog.Felt Story: Dear Zoo by Rod Campbell     When I was in library school, I interned at a great library where I observed a handful of preschool story times. At one of these story times, the librarian told Dear Zoo using flannelboard pieces that included cut manila folders to look like the animals' boxes. This story is one of the first felt stories I've made from scratch, and it is great for all sorts of story times. Perhaps best of all, you can leave out animals if you start to lose your audience--but in my experience, they love to come up and find out what's in each box from the zoo!Story: Polar Bear, Polar Bear, What Do You Hear? by Bill Martin     Usually kids are familiar with Brown Bear, Brown Bear, so this variation is a welcome addition to story time. The simple, bright illustrations introduce even more animals to the young readers, and the focus on sound leaves room to practice animal sounds.Rhyme: \"Five Little Monkeys Swinging in a Tree\"     I love this rhyme, and I use my Five Little Monkeys finger puppets and alligator hand puppet to make it even more fun. For smaller groups, I'll hand out monkeys to the kiddos so that they can swing around with them. This particular group was so amused by Mr. Alligator eating the monkeys that they would throw the monkey finger puppets and then run to mom for protection from the hungry reptile.Story: Monkey and Me by Katie Gravett     This is a fantastic story for calming everyone down. It has a great rhythm, and it asks for a lot of motion--enough to start to drain kids' energy. By the end of the book when Monkey and the child fall asleep following all their adventures, program-goers are reading for something quiet, too.Craft: Zooscapes     Making a zooscape can be as simple or as complicated as you want. I had sheets of blue construction paper at each child's seat, as well as a half sheet of green construction paper with its edge cut wavily. Kids used glue sticks to glue their rolling hills onto the sky background, providing a meadow for their animals. I had trays of stick-on foam animals for kids to add to their zooscapes, and I also set out crayons in case they wanted to add trees, the sun, or anything else. Some of the kids were into sticking as many foam animals on their page as possible, while others were more into coloring. Either way, everyone was engaged and enjoying their craft!Other books I had on hand in case they were needed:Zoo Ah-choooo by Peter MandelMy Heart is Like a Zoo by Michael Hall"},
{"title": null, "date": "Monday, August 20, 2012", "text": "Just in time to refresh kids' paper airplane skills before the school year begins... it's Airplane Science!Now that summer reading is over and I have a full year at my branch under my belt, it's time to put into action the programming aspect of my science initiative: monthly science programming, alternating between school-age and preschool audiences. The first program in this new year-round series took place a week and a half ago. Here's what we did for Airplane Science: To begin our program, I asked the kiddos what they knew about flight. What sorts of things can fly? How do they accomplish flight? I guided conversation toward airplanes specifically, and then I posed the major question: how do airplanes fly through the air? Kids offered wings, air, propellers, and engines as possible explanations for how airplanes fly, at which point it was my cue to explain (briefly) the science behind airplanes--and paper airplanes, our hands-on component for the program.My simplified explanation was two-fold. First I showed them a diagram from How Stuff Works that illustrates the various forces at work on an airplane during flight: thrust, drag, gravity, and lift. We talked about the relationship of those forces for a minute, ending with the question of how the forces need to be balanced for flight to occur. Second, then, was an explanation of Bernoulli's Principle and how it relates to flight and airplane design. I showed a second diagram, but the kids found the physical demonstration more interesting: hovering a ping-pong ball with a hair dryer.After a few minutes for lingering questions and my prompting the kids to think about how the shape of wings, size of wings, etc., might affect the flight of paper airplanes, I mentioned that the Wright brothers tested some of their airplane designs in paper first. Then I set everyone free to make their own test models. I had four stations set up with paper, markers for writing names and decorating, straws and tape (when necessary), and instructions on how to make four different paper airplanes: the arrow, the dart, the moth, and the hoop glider. I spent the next fifteen minutes of construction time moving about the program room helping kids as they requested assistance in their airplane-making. A number of the program-goers had parents in tow, and those parents were a huge help in assembling test planes, too. I encouraged the kiddos to think about how they might improve on the paper airplanes, and to make modifications to the design accordingly. At the end of our construction time, we had a huge variety of planes ready for testing.We finished off the program with what I called our Airplane Olympics (the Olympics were in full swing at this point!). Before the program, I had set up a masking tape starting line and marked off 25 feet in one-foot intervals--perfect to measuring the success of our planes. All of the kids got a turn to throw each of their designs. I'm happy to say that at least one of every child's designs flew well--no one felt like their paper airplanes failed. Several of the planes did funny tricks or flipped back behind the thrower, and these trials got good-hearted laughs from everyone. Also, once everyone had seen a dozen or so flights, I started asking kids to predict what certain airplane models might do when thrown. By the end of our series of about 75 test flights, kids were able to guess which models would glide far and which might dive-bomb the spectators (and shield their eyes accordingly). Our top performer flew 24 feet.We had a final plane toss with our top three models, and our top performer flew 24 feet. I then wrapped up the program by encouraging the kids to continue to refine their paper airplane designs for maximum flight time and distance. I had plenty of folding instructions and books on airplanes (of the paper and real varieties) available for kids who wanted to continue their science exploration at home, and many kids left with these materials in addition to the paper airplanes they had made and tested. I think this program was a great balance between the scientific principles of flight and fun, hands-on experimentation. I highly recommend giving this program, or one like it, a shot at your library."},
{"title": null, "date": "Friday, August 17, 2012", "text": "We have a really strong Teen Advisory Board at my branch. At any given meeting, it's no surprise to have upwards of 25 teens in attendance. They are enthusiastic, dedicated, and thoughtful--and they love the library. Turns out that several other branches in our district also have great TABs, too, and these various TAB members wanted to meet--somewhere cool, doing something epic. Thus the all-TAB lock-in was born.We had quite a crowd show up!Our all-TAB lock-in took place last Friday evening from 6 p.m. to midnight at a recently rebuilt large branch--complete with a children's wing and an adult services wing, a layout whose importance will be more apparent later. We had two requirements of teens who wanted to participate: 1) that they be an active member of their branch's TAB; and 2) that they have a permission slip signed by a parent/guardian (to legally protect the library and to ensure parents knew when to pick up their teens) and the participating teen (to acknowledge a behavior standard). Not huge requirements, and very reasonable for encouraging teens to attend an event unlike anything we'd ever hosted.We had 62 teens show up. 62! Better than we had been hoping for! With 9 library staffers working the event, that made for a decent teen-to-adult ratio. At 6 p.m. we locked the doors, and for six moderately-scheduled hours, teens had the run of the lower floor of the library. Here's a break-down of our lock-in:6:00 - 6:15 p.m.: Checking in teens     Verifying permission slips, accepting a canned good for donation to a local food pantry as \"payment\" for participation (we weren't firm on the canned good, as some teens forgot theirs). All teens got a name tag that also listed the branch library where they are involved in a TAB.6:15 - 6:30 p.m.: Ground rules and Ice breaker game     Ground rules included establishing off-limits areas of the library building, not doing anything that would be destructive to the library, and maintaining a baseline of respect for all fellow TAB members. We also explained the schedule for the night.     For our ice breaker, everyone sat in a tight circle with me starting in the middle. I introduced myself and said a fact about myself. At that point all other people in the circle about whom that fact is also true stood up, too--and then everyone standing had to scramble to find the seat of another standing person not located immediately next to them. The one person left standing after all the seats have been filled starts the process over again (introduction, fact, SCRAMBLE). This game is a great way to get energy up, start to introduce people by name, and demonstrate that we all have a lot in common.6:30 - 7:00 p.m.: Dinner!     Say what you will about Little Caesars, but those $5 hot-n-ready pizzas are crazy cost-effective when you're buying 22 of them. We also had a variety of chips, cookies, and sodas/water. A snack table stayed up throughout most of the evening, too, for grazers.7:00 - 10:00 p.m.: Activity stations     We had four activity stations going on simultaneously:     1) Crafts: Shrinky dinks and friendship bracelets. Oh, my, did they love the shrinky dinks.     2) Buffy Marathon     3) Videogaming: We had two Wiis and an Xbox set up with a variety of games.     4) Games: Our traditional games station offered three separate games, each of which took an hour. From 7 to 8 p.m. was a Book Cake Walk--essentially your standard school fun fair cake walk, except the walking squares showed YA book titles and the prizes were ARCs. From 8 to 9 p.m. was Book Bingo; all squares on the bingo cards were YA book titles, and bingos earned entries in a drawing for a $20 gas station gift card. Then from 9 to 10 p.m. was Minute to Win It, a variety of crazy and exciting one-minute competitive games; winners again earned entries in the gift card drawing.10:00 - 11:00 p.m.: All-TAB Meeting     TAB members are used to having meetings. For some of them, TAB meetings make up the bulk of their library participation. This All-TAB Meeting provided an opportunity for the TABs from all of the different branches to brainstorm and idea-share. What activities did they hear about that they want to try at their own branches? What would they recommend other branches try? Do they want to collaborate across TABs, and if so, how? We had a back-up plan in case the meeting fizzled and only took twenty minutes, but the teens were happy to spend the full hour talking about what their TAB does, what they enjoy, and what they want to accomplish. If you every doubt the capacity of teenagers to care about issues and make plans to address them, you should attend a library TAB meeting.     Note: Two staff members who helped with the lock-in are not in charge of their branches' TABs; thus during the meeting they cleaned up stations to prepare for the final game.11:00 - 11:50 p.m.: Glow-in-the-Dark Capture the FlagWhy, yes, that is me creeping with a Nerf gun.     Remember how I mentioned the library layout--a children's wing and an adult wing with a central foyer--would come into play in this lock-in? Glow-in-the-Dark Capture the Flag is when that happened. We split the TABs into two roughly-equally teams--individual branches stayed together and combined with others--and assigned each a wing. All participants got glow sticks, and each team had a large glow stick flag to hide and defend. We explained the rules we would be using: if you're tagged on the other team's territory, you go to their jail; stay in jail until \"jailbreak\" is announced over the PA; the foyer is neutral territory; no carrying your flag around except to change its hiding location; and, my favorite, if you are hit by a dart from a staff member's Nerf gun, you go to jail (regardless of what team you're on!). After a few questions, we turned off all the lights on the lower floor (safety lights remained on for a bit of visibility without ruining the whole glow-in-the-dark aspect). Let the games begin!     One team was definitely more coordinated than the other, so the first game ended after ten minutes. We started a second game, which lasted fifteen minutes. At that point we had the teams switch sides--would that affect the outcome? We didn't get a chance to definitively answer that question, as we had to call the game at 11:50 to wrap things up. The team that had won twice got to enter their members' names in the gift card drawing. Everyone said they had a lot of fun playing Capture the Flag.11:50 - 11:55 p.m.: Group photo and Prize drawing     It was surprisingly easy to get all of the teens in a mass to take their group photo. They were then centrally located to hear the drawing winner announced. Excitement all around!12:00 a.m.: Teens picked up     All the teens were picked up by their parents by 12:10 a.m., which means staff got to finish cleaning up quickly and were on their own ways home by 12:30. A successful end to a busy night.Everything went very smoothly--even surprisingly so for a first-time big event. Since I was staffing the craft area near a phone, I updated folks about the schedule every hour via the PA system. Library staff mainly stayed around their activity areas, leaving teens free to go from place to place as they pleased. As far as I could tell, we had no behavioral issues. Everyone got along, no one tried to get into off-limits areas of the library... It was a rousing success, and a great way to top off the summer.Teens are already asking when we'll do a lock-in again. The plan for right now is for our district to make the all-TAB lock-in an annual event--with the knowledge that excitement and participation will continue to grow. If you're looking to reward your hard-working teens with a fun, special activity, I highly suggest you give a lock-in some thought--especially now that you've got a program plan."},
{"title": null, "date": "Wednesday, August 15, 2012", "text": "While stories dealing with tragic historical events are useful in helping young readers mentally deal with the reality that bad things happen, stories dealing with young people's personal grief are a horse of a different color. Often readers find these stories--need these stories--after they have faced a very personal loss. That's a good thing, because sometimes we need to see a well-developed character work through his or her own issues before we can really confront our own. Two new titles make great additions to the myriad lists that seek to help young readers deal with the death of someone close to them.Pitcher, Annabel. My Sister Lives on the Mantelpiece. Little, Brown and Company. Aug. 14, 2012. p. 224.     In this middle-grade/young adult novel by a British author, 10-year-old Jamie's life has turned totally upside down. After his older sister Rose was killed in a terrorist bombing in London five years ago, his family started to fall apart: his father began to drink a lot and became extremely xenophobic; his mother spent more and more time with Nigel from her grief group; and Rose's twin Jasmine became very insecure and introverted. When Jamie, his sister, and his father move to the Lake District after Jamie's mother leaves the family, Jamie hopes for a fresh start. Nothing really seems to have changed, however, except for the fact that Jamie makes a friend at school. There's just one problem, however: Jamie's new friend, Sunya, is Muslim, a fact that will not fly with Jamie's father since he asserts \"Muslims killed his daughter.\" Jamie struggles not only with the death of a sister whom he barely remembers, but also with the death of his family unit as he knew it. With hope, perseverance, and a deep-seated belief that people are good, Jamie does his best to navigate his new normal with minimal help from the grown-ups in his life. The book is often heart-wrenching and always beautiful, and it will make a great resource for talking about grief as well as the recent prevalence of prejudice against Muslims.Johnson, J.J. The Theory of Everything. Peachtree. Oct. 1, 2012. p. 320.     Teenager Sarah was with her best friend, Jamie, when she died in a freakish accident almost a year ago. Since then, Sarah's world has been completely opposite what it was: she has not spoken to Jamie's family since the death, she fights with her own parents despite not meaning to, and the mysterious \"snark box\" that has replaced her mouth verbally assaults all the kids at school who would talk to her. Existence feels very difficult for Sarah despite the patience and kindness of a few people in her life, including her boyfriend. Sarah starts to make things better for herself, though, when she enters into an odd work arrangement with a loner janitor who grows Christmas trees. The physical work seems to bring Sarah some clarity, and she does her best to work through Jamie's death and reach out to those who love her and who also suffered. One such person is Emmett, Jamie's twin, whom Sarah could not previously bring herself to face. With eyes and heart truly open for the first time since Jamie's death, Sarah begins to figure out what it means to live the rest of her life. Johnson gives Sarah a remarkably poignant and real voice of a teenager going through something she never could have imagined. Doodled illustrations at the beginning of each chapter add to the great character development and make Sarah very relatable even as she lashes out at those around her. A great main character to lead a moving story."},

It's time now to officially close out the summer reading volunteers experience for 2012 with some appreciation, some reflection, and the final stats.Having ravaged the sandwich and chips spread,the teens commenced with movie-watching.As a thanks for all of our teen volunteers' hard work and hours spent at the library over the summer, the library hosts an informal appreciation party between the end of SRP and the beginning of school. The 2012 Teen Summer Reading Volunteer Appreciation Party was a lot of fun. Teens enjoyed a spread of sub sandwiches, chips, cookies, and drinks. After some brief mingling time, we drew names for prizes; winners chose from our stash of Own the Night swag and ARCs (really good ARCs, folks). Then we popped in a movie (The Goonies!!!) and relaxed for the evening. Groups of volunteers would chat for a bit before returning their attention to the movie, so the whole event had a chill, social feel. Teens enjoyed the throwback movie and the chance to just hang out before homework kicks in again. Consensus was that the evening really made them feel--guess--appreciated. (Don't they just have the best sense of humor?)I spent my quiet time during the movie reflecting on the whole experience of mixing teen volunteers with the behemoth that is summer reading. What I learned:Training: I cannot emphasize enough how integral training is to empowering summer reading volunteers to perform well. (See earlier post.) Also, make cheat sheets with key program details and plaster them all over the summer reading desk. Staff also find these cheat sheets useful.Scheduling: Teens will enthusiastically show up for their first shift. After that, most of them will show up most of the time approximately when they are scheduled to volunteer. If they know they can't make a shift, they may or may not call you ahead of time to let you know. This is true regardless of how much you stress punctuality. Thus it is very important to have all library staff trained on the program so that anyone can effectively fill these sudden program table voids.More teens (and their parents) will ask to volunteer once they see other teens volunteering: This sort of contagious enthusiasm is great, but at a certain point the costs of training and scheduling a new volunteer outweigh what that volunteer can contribute during the summer reading program. My cutoff for new volunteers was two weeks into the program.Discipline: At some point, you'll encounter a behavioral issue. If you're lucky, it will be a teen playing on a phone instead of reading during downtime. If you're less lucky, it will be a teen loudly using language unbecoming of a library representative (use your imagination). Regardless of the issue, I do two things: 1) calmly acknowledge the issue and why it is problematic; 2) state that volunteers are expected to act professionally and that said issue will not be tolerated again. That's it. No yelling, no blaming, nada. Teens are smart, and they are usually far more embarrassed about their problem behavior than I am angry about it. One brief, serious warning and they are good at self-policing.All of my volunteers worked hard to enthusiastically engage kids and teens in the 2012 Summer Reading Program. I'm glad I have plenty of notes and experience from this year, which was very successful, and I will use them to inform how I utilize volunteers in summer 2013.Final Summer Reading Program 2012 stats:Total program registrations (children and teens): 3592Total program completions (children and teens): 1549 -- 43% of registrationsTotal volunteer hours worked: 454Number of volunteers helping with summer reading: 36P.S. Did you catch my Goonies reference right at the beginning of the post? That's dedication to a theme."},

I love that I can get through several juvenile audiobooks in a relatively short span of time, and I simultaneously stay up-to-date on children's titles while storing away title names for audiobook readers' advisory interviews. Here are three fantastic audiobooks to top off your summer, all funny and featuring male protagonists.Look, Lenore. Alvin Ho: Allergic to Girls, School, and Other Scary Things. Read by Everette Plen. Listening Library, 123 minutes unabridged.     Alvin Ho is about to start the second grade, which would be fine if it weren't for the fact that he's afraid of school. He's so afraid that he cannot speak at all from the moment he steps off the school bus, which results in some amount of misfortune and teasing. Alvin Ho is also afraid of girls, which is unfortunate because his deskmate is Flea, short for Sophie, who is a girl--which is still bad even if she's a girl with a really cool eye patch. Needless to say, young Alvin Ho has a lot to deal with, from school and friends and family to the psychotherapist he sees because of his fear-induced mute episodes to the old lady down the street who gives piano lessons. Alvin encounters all sorts of average and hilarious situations that gradeschoolers will recognize, if not from their own experience then from that of their friends. This laugh-out-loud title is read perfectly by young actor Everette Plen, who gives Alvin Ho just the voice Look's story showcases. Alvin Ho features in several books in the series bearing his name.Angleberger, Tom. The Strange Case of Origami Yoda. Read by Mark Turetsky, Greg Steinbruner, Jonathan Todd Ross, Julia Gibson, and Charlotte Parry. Recorded Books, 135 minutes unabridged.     Main narrator Tommy has taken it upon himself to create a case file pertaining to incidents involving Origami Yoda--the origami rendering of Yoda that fellow sixth-grader Dwight wears on his finger and who dispenses Jedi-worthy advice to all who ask. Tommy and his classmates recount all of the instances in which they consulted Origami Yoda and discuss the results, and Tommy and his friend Harvey weigh in after each episode, giving a great structure to the series of first-person accounts of Origami Yoda's mysterious powers. Angleberger's characters are well-developed and their voices spot on, and the humor that pervades this often touching school story is outstanding. The use of multiple readers adds to the authenticity of the audiobook, as the listener really begins to feel the different kids emerge as their own unique selves. The Origami Yoda series continues with Darth Paper Strikes Back and the just-released The Secret of the Fortune Wookiee.Hiaasen, Carl. Chomp. Read by James Van Der Beek. Listening Library, 371 minutes unabridged.     Wahoo Cray isn't your average kid on his summer vacation. His father is a professional animal wrangler, and this summer Wahoo and his dad are hired to provide animal help for a popular reality tv show called Expedition Survival! The Crays need the money, so despite the tv studios controlling demands--and the even more annoying and needy star of the show, Derek Badger--they accept the job and all that comes with it. After a near-fatal run-in with Alice, the Crays' alligator, the foolhardy Derek Badger decides to film the rest of the Everglades episode out in the actual Everglades. With the Crays along for the shoot accompanied by a school friend of Wahoo's, things begin to spiral deeper and deeper into potentially-deadly chaos. After everything goes wrong, Wahoo's only hope for escape from a deranged tv survivalist, his friend's gun-toting drunk dad, and the natural threats of the Everglades is his own determination and skill. Wahoo is a great main character, and while Van Der Beek's narration isn't always consistent, Hiaasen's great writing carries the whole audiobook."},
{"title": null, "date": "Wednesday, August 8, 2012", "text": "As a former camper and camp counselor, one of my favorite things about summer is a campfire. Why, I asked myself last spring as I was planning summer programs, should kids whose summers take place at the library not get the great experience of a campfire the same way that camp kids do? I decided a campfire program was indeed in order, and after making some modifications for library limitations (primarily the flammability of absolutely everything), I offered the following campfire program for school-age kids last week. It was a hit!Campfire FunCraft: Campfire Craft from Wonderopolis     A real campfire in the library = bad news. Thus I opened this program with a campfire craft, at which we all created individual campfires with the intention of using them to \"light\" our campfire circle for the rest of the program. I printed out on flame-colored paper the Campfire Craft Kit from Wonderopolis's Camp What-a-Wonder (love those guys!), and I assembled the necessary crafting materials on our work tables. The plan was to color the fires; cut out the pieces; glue necessary pieces together; then assemble the campfires. A good plan! We were momentarily derailed by a kiddo's exclamation that it would be so cool if this could glow in the dark! \"Indeed,\" I thought, \"that would be awesome,\" and then I scampered off to get our glow in the dark paint. A great idea with one problem: glow in the dark paint, like all paint, needs time to dry. Whoops. Our campfires were a bit messier and took a bit longer than I had planned. As everyone was thoroughly enjoying themselves, however, I broke out the wet wipes, amended the program plan, and went with it.Snack: Walking S'mores     One of the best things about campfires: s'mores! Sticky, sticky s'mores! In an effort to avoid too much mess (see above paint incident for evidence of hilarious failure), I opted to offer walking s'mores to the kiddos when we moved from the craft to our campfire circle. Walking s'mores are a trail mix-like mixture of Teddy Grahams (or other graham cracker cookie bit), chocolate chips, and mini marshmallows. I was anticipating at least a few grumbles about not getting \"real\" s'mores, but in reality all the kiddos were super excited about this twist on a favorite. It was easy to adapt for a participant who can't have chocolate, too, as I just poured her a cup of Teddy Grahams and marshmallows. Lots of happy munching going on as I moved to the next part of the program...Campfire Story: \"The Chicken in the Library\"     Because this program was advertised for all school-age kids, I decided to avoid any stories that were even remotely scary (save the eerie for the older kids in October!). Instead I chose a great, punny favorite that just happens to involve a librarian. Read it aloud to get the full effect of the joke!Campfire Songs:     No campfire is complete, in my mind, without great songs. I mentioned that I was a camp counselor, and as such I have a number of strange and goofy camp songs permanently etched in my brain. The thing about a library campfire is that, for the most part, kids have never heard the songs before--and as a result the song leader should choose simple repeat-after-me, repetitive, or cumulative songs to share with the group so everyone can get involved. I shared, to great enjoyment and loud giggles, the following three before it was time to go:\"Tarzan\"(this is a repeat-after-me song, so kids repeat the words and motions after each line)Tarzan! (beat chest like Tarzan)Swinging on a rubber band. (mime swinging on vines)Tarzan! (beat chest)Smashed into a frying pan. (clap hands loudly)Ouch! That hurt! (rub neck)Now Tarzan's got a tan.

While all of the reading and excitement that goes on during the nine weeks of the summer reading program is fantastic, those nine weeks are also crazy hectic and time-consuming for all of the library staff. Everyone at the library is breathing a sigh of relief now that we know we've made it to the end of the summer. And while it will still be a few days before I tally the final statistics and recap the grand summer reading volunteers experiment, I want to join the trend and make a few basic reflections on the summer--before all my thoughts and suggestions are forgotten and thus don't factor into next year's planning.I love the idea to not have staff-led programming during the first and last weeks of summer reading. Since these two bookend weeks see tons of kids at the summer reading table, we could use as much staff support to sign kids up and hand out prizes--even with an army of teen volunteers on hand. In theory this programming lull will also help ease staff into the SRP.Series programming really seems to work well for a potential audience with the whole summer off. Both my picnic lunch and movie programs did consistently well this summer, and I will make sure to schedule both series into the Summer 2013 plan.Special programs fill up fast, especially if they have the word \"party\" tacked on the end. If I opt to include a party program in future summers, I will absolutely offer at least two sessions to accommodate demand. However, I'm currently not sure that I want to offer these planning-intensive and demanding-of-staff programs during summer reading, when we already have lots of featured performers who can reach a much larger audience. I'll have to ponder that thought.I need to rethink my summer craft programs. While the crafternoons were successful, I think there is significant room for improvement. This summer we offered two crafternoons--one in June, one in July--where supplies were available in the program room for a 90-minute period. A children's staff member was on hand the entire time to explain the craft, provide help when needed, and supervise. Despite the fact that our advertising said families could attend at any time in the 90-minute window, 95% of our participants showed up at the very beginning and were finished and gone fifteen minutes later. I want to figure out a way to meet the craft wants of my customers while utilizing staff and supplies more effectively. I'll be scouring blogs for ideas, but I'd love to hear your thoughts in the comments!While we had great summer reading displays out in the main library area, we didn't have one for use in the programming room. As a result, at some programs we remembered to talk up summer reading and at others we forgot. I want to make some sort of mobile, attractive summer reading display that we can take into programs to promote the summer reading program at all library events.Those are my thoughts for now as I look back on my first summer in charge of summer reading at my branch. I'm sure more ideas and criticisms will present themselves before it's time to plan for Summer 2013, when I'll also sit on the district-wide committee to plan the whole reading program. Until then, I know I join my staff in breathing a sigh of relief at having crossed the finish line."},

I've seen mention of and links to the poll everywhere, from Twitter and Tumblr to blogs, newspapers, and all-staff e-mails. By all accounts NPR has already received massive voter input to whittle their list of 235 YA titles down to the top 100. Have you voted yet?image from NPRSince the run-up to the new school year is always a scramble for teens to read the assigned summer reading--some of which they enjoy, a lot of which they don't--I figured now is a good time to share a list of what I consider to be dependably-awesome YA reads. Here are the top 10 YA novels that I voted for in NPR's poll, in alphabetical order by title:The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian by Sherman Alexie     I've said for years that I think every high-schooler should read this book. It's funny, poignant, and meaningful, dealing with issues of poverty, alcoholism, racism, prejudice, and entitlement without ever feeling heavy-handed. Alexie has a talent for making the experiences of one admittedly quirky kid, Junior, resonate with everyone--a talent in writing in any genre.The Book Thief by Marcus Zusak     I'll be the first to admit that I had to work hard to get through the first 150 pages or so of this book, which is narrated by Death in a voice that can feel confusingly achronological. Once you get deeper into the story of Liesl, a young girl who finds herself with a foster family in WWII Germany, you get absolutely sucked in. Liesl wants more than anything to be able to read, and that innocent quest pulls her through the horrors of a brutal war.The Giver by Lois Lowry     Lois Lowry knows how to write a dystopian world. When Jonas receives his life assignment from his elders, his life takes a different turn from the placid normality he's been taught to expect. With the guidance of the Giver, he sees that his perfect world may not be so perfect after all. This story is compelling, intriguing, and so well written--it absolutely deserves its long-standing place on best-of lists.I Capture the Castle by Dodie Smith     This is perhaps an odd choice, as I don't know that many people have had access to Smith's I Capture the Castle. It is the story of Cassandra and her eccentric family, who have lived in a falling-apart castle in rural England since her genius father failed to produce a second novel after his hit debut. Cassandra confesses all aspects of her life to her diary, and when new, young neighbors move into the manor house next door, she puts her daydreams aside to witness the real-life romantic interactions that play out before her. A great voice from a remarkable narrator.Looking for Alaska by John Green     Every YA reading list needs a story set in a boarding school, and Looking for Alaska is one of the best. When Miles started school at Culver Creek, he wasn't expecting to meet anyone as interesting, alluring, or reckless as Alaska. The two become good friends, and all seems like normal teenage angst until an event that reshapes Miles's life forever. Fun fact: Looking for Alaska recently appeared on the NYT Bestsellers List--seven years after it was first published.The Perks of Being a Wallflower by Stephen Chbosky     I once had a friend who loved unreliable narrators--thus she loved Charlie in this book. Charlie is that misfit high school freshman that we've all seen or been, and the year he falls in with a similarly-misfitting crowd, including Patrick and Samantha, makes all the difference in his life. Perks is chock-full of situations and scenarios real teens encounter, from romantic confusion to trying to fit in to discovering things about self.The Pigman by Paul Zindel     What starts as a prank for teens John and Lorraine turns into a surprising friendship with the older Mr. Pignati, a man whose collection of pigs is what first catches John's and Lorraine's eyes. This odd new friendship greatly affects the pair of teens, and they are left wondering how they can fill the void left by the Pigman when he dies. This story does not shy away from the fact that teenagers can do mean, stupid things, but it gives them credit for great kindness and feeling, too.To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee     This is probably the only book in my top-ten list that regularly makes it onto school reading lists, and with reason. Not only is the story amazingly beautiful and impactful, it provides so much fodder for discussion. What is right? For what things should we as humans fight? Is there such a thing as doing good vs. doing evil? If you stop to think about it, teens face questions like these every day.Weetzie Bat by Francesca Lia Block     Set in Shangri-L.A., this story is a bona fide urban fairy tale full of glitter, fun, and self-discovery. Weetzie and her friends were very unconventional characters for most readers when the book was published in 1989, and they are still kitsch-ily odd today. The group do things their way, form a family on their own terms, and always face the world together. To narrowly define this book as a fantastic LGBTQ read--which it is--might limit the enjoyment all readers will surely get from Weetzie Bat.Where Things Come Back by John Corey Whaley     In his debut novel, Whaley gives teens credit for being capable of reading--and enjoying!--a non-cliched story with complex themes. The summer that Cullen's younger brother goes missing is also the summer an extinct woodpecker reappears in his hometown. It is also the summer to which everything in Cabot Searcy's life has been leading. I could say I love this book for its strong male characters, or for its beautiful language, or for its truthful depictions of teenage ennui and familial love. This book is so much more than I can briefly sum up. Let's just say it deserves all the awards it has won, and more.~*~So there you have it, my votes in NPR's Top 100 Young Adult Novels poll. If you're looking for a book to finish out your summer, I hope you enjoy one of these."},

Aug. 2012. p. 304.     Lorelei's life hasn't been so great lately; her mother died a year ago, her father has just gotten remarried to a superficial and deceptive woman, her brother is being mean to her, and her school has burned down. Luckily there's a new school in the area, and the kind principal of Splendid Academy seems like a fairy godmother after all Lorelei has been going through. Lorelei and her friends are completely in love with this new school, with its amazing playground, lax classroom rules, and divine food--breakfast, lunch, snacks galore... But everything might not be as wonderful as it seems. When Lorelei and her new friend Andrew team up to find out the truth about Splendid Academy, they end up having to use their wits and their wiles to overcome the witchy magic that threatens all of the unsuspecting students. This adventure tale has a steady pace and intriguing plot, but it goes deeper than the average fairy tale-esque adventure. The story also explores a child's guilt after a loved one's death, bullying, and obesity in a fashion that does not feel heavy-handed.Dashner, James. The Infinity Ring: A Mutiny in Time. Scholastic. Aug. 2012. p. 192.     Dak and Sera, two genius pre-teens, live in an alternate present in which a nefarious group called the SQ is in control of everything across the globe. History, Dak's favorite topic, is noticeably different from what readers know; for example, Christopher Columbus was thrown overboard during a mutiny on his momentous voyage, and the mutineers were credited with the discovery of the Americas. It turns out that Dak's parents have been working on a time travel device called an Infinity Ring, and a secret group called the Hystorians have an large interest in the device. Each major break from the historical timeline as readers know it, it seems, has done damage to the fabric of time, resulting in horrible natural disasters as Earth barrels toward destruction. After Dak and Sera find themselves in the secret headquarters of the Hystorians, they learn just how important the Infinity Ring is to righting the wrongs in history--and the fate of the world falls to their hands. This first title in a new, multi-author series has a definite 39 Clues-style look and feel, and the well-plotted adventures of the dynamic leading pair have a captivating amount of humor and intrigue. Sure to be a hit with fans of The 39 Clues series.Bachmann, Stefan. The Peculiar. Greenwillow Books. Sept. 2012. p. 384.     Bartholomew is a changling in an England totally unfriendly to those with human and fairy blood. He and his sister need to stay hidden for their safety--especially now that changlings have been turning up murdered in the Thames. When an MP stumbles upon the horrendous plot behind the murders, he goes to great lengths to try to thwart the malicious intentions of a fellow parliamentarian. The stakes become even higher for everyone once Bartholomew's sister is kidnapped and the clock begins to tick ever nearer to a cataclysmic event. This narrative-heavy debut looks to be the first in a series, and its combination of steampunk, fantasy, and science fiction elements will appeal to readers in a variety of genres.Avi. Sophia's War: A Tale of the Revolution. Beach Lane Books. Sept. 2012. p. 320.     It is 1776, and Sophia and her family are in New York City, hiding their American Patriot sympathies from the British who are occupying Manhattan. When a British officer comes to board in Sophia's house, the family must even conceal the existence of Sophia's brother William, who is off fighting under George Washington. Sophia has always considered herself as strong a Patriot as her brother, but living with this British officer--with fine manners and flattering words--has left her feeling conflicted about her sympathies. Conflicted, that is, until something horrible happens to Sophia's family and solidifies her feelings toward the British forces. The second half of the book flashes forward to 1780, when Sophia decides to do something to support her Patriot beliefs and agrees to work in a British officer's household as a spy. Sophia uncovers a massive military secret--but it comes from the pen of the officer who once lived in her family's house. Suddenly all the events in Sophia's life are matters of life and death--and her life is not the only one at stake. This engaging historical novel excels with Sophia's strong voice, and her struggle reconciling her political beliefs with her personal feelings comes across as nothing but genuine. Rich with historical detail, this novel will be a great read for fans of Dear America and like series, and its superb writing gives it something more than most books in the genre.All four novels were reviewed in their galley formats. The final published books may differ from the review copies."},
{"title": null, "date": "Wednesday, July 25, 2012", "text": "As part of my library outreach, I visit a fair number of year-round daycares. My daycare numbers increase in the summers, since many school-age kids find themselves in these programs once school is out of session. To accommodate this wider age range, I've been asked to provide multiple story times when I visit daycares in the summer: one for the younger kiddos I've been visiting all year, and a second one for the older school-age kids. I'm happy to oblige, even considering the extra planning involved.These visits do take extra planning--I wouldn't dare read the older kids the same books that I read to the little ones! For one, the older kids would complain about being read \"baby\" books. And secondly, these kids' school experiences have equipped them for longer, more complex stories. They are able to think at least somewhat abstractly, to recognize themes and morals, and to understand cause and effect with more depth than their younger siblings. Older kids also have more nuanced senses of humor, a fact that makes reading with them all the more enjoyable. I try to keep all of these things in mind when I select stories to read aloud with a school-age group. Here are some of my go-to book categories when planning these outreach story times.Folk Tales and Fairy Tales     I'm always surprised at how many kids don't know classic folk and fairy tales these days. Sure, they've got traditional tale references in popular culture (think the Shrek films, kids' tv shows, everything Disney, etc.), but more often than not kids are unfamiliar with the actual story of a folk or fairy tale. Thus I always try to bring at least one such book to my school-age read alouds. Knowing classic tales like Jack and the Beanstalk, Rapunzel, and Hansel and Gretel helps kids grasp some of the most common themes in life, and it also prepares them for the allusions they'll see in everything else they read in their lives. Once kids have a basic understanding of common fairy tales, they can get greater enjoyment out of variations, too (e.g., Princess Furball as a wonderful variation on Cinderella). And folk tales have been passed down through the generations for centuries because they impart something true about life to everyone who hears them. Sure, lots of folk tales can be a bit scary--my favorite, Heckedy Peg, included--but kids gobble that up. These older kids are of an age that they enjoy testing their limits, and study after study demonstrates that books and stories are the optimal forum for doing so. If your audience turns out to already know the stories you've selected, you need not fret. These books are almost always beautifully illustrated, and I've known a ten-minute story to take twice that long because everyone wanted to admire the pictures. Narrative, Illustrated Non-Fiction     School-age children have ever-developing understandings of fiction versus non-fiction, and I always love to highlight some amazing true stories in my read alouds to help reinforce this difference. Imagination is important in sharing stories with kids, but the fascination prompted by a true story can often reach that hard-to-please young listener. Luckily for us librarians, there are more and more fantastic non-fiction picture books published every year, and many of these make terrific read alouds. Some of my favorites: Pierre the Penguin, about a penguin who, I am sad to say, has a major problem in that he has no butt feathers (Oh my gosh! The librarian just said \"butt!\"); and Librarian on the Roof!, an account of one Texas librarian's advocacy for young readers at her library. Sharing true stories like these allows kiddos to not only see the world they know reflected in the pictures of a book, but to also see themselves and the things they care about most.Proven Favorites     I probably don't need to make much of an argument to encourage librarians to include their favorite stories in school-age read alouds. After all, we are well aware of the enduring popularity of such titles--maybe we even have fond recollections of having them read aloud to us when we were youngsters. My short argument, then, is this: don't assume just because a book is a proven favorite or classic that kids have read it; and even if they have already read it, don't assume they don't want to read it again. These favorites are like a rite of passage: once a child has read the story, he or she is part of the group that is \"in the know.\" Some perennially popular titles that come to mind are Purple, Green and Yellow and Miss Nelson is Missing! Both of these stories have great endings--one silly and laugh-inducing, one that feels like being let in on a secret. Kids love knowing that they are part of the club that \"gets\" these books after they've experienced them; and I love that I get to initiate them into that club whose members love books. With titles like these, we all win.So there you have it, my three most-used categories of read aloud material for older children. What titles do you share with your school-age crowd? What are your go-to types of books?"},

Mystery!Do genre stickers help?I am curious to know what different librarians have to say in response to this major question of how young patrons find what they want. Do you instruct children on the traditional alphebetical and Dewey organizations? Do you adapt your organization schemes like Darien Library, who reorganized their children's picture books, or school librarian Tali Balas Kaplan, who created a homegrown system to replace Dewey? Do you use genre stickers? Color-coding? Theme displays? What do you do to make sure kids can find what they want, regardless of whether they come to the library knowing what that item might be?I'd love to hear from a bunch of librarians from a variety of libraries I want to know what works for you and your kids."},

She's determined to thoroughly enjoy herself--and who cares that a series of horrible murders is taking place? Evie eventually finds herself caught up in the strange case, however, and things only get stranger as spiritualism, a religious cult, and a terrible prophecy intersect to wreak havoc on the city, Evie, and other people with gifts like hers. As expected of Bray, the story is well crafted and captivating. It is simply stunning how many readers this book will appeal to: it's got mystery, horror, suspense, the paranormal, great twenties historical details and lingo, strong yet flawed characters, multiple storylines, rebellion, romance... in short, there's something for almost everyone. If readers can get past the heft--and they should, it's totally worth it!--they're sure to be pleased.King, A.S. Ask the Passengers. Little, Brown BFYR. Oct. 2012. p. 304.     Astrid spends a lot of time on the picnic table in her backyard, looking up into the sky and sending the passengers on airplanes her love. She feels her love is useful to these strangers--but not useful to herself and her life as it stands. Astrid hates her small town, feels criticized and unloved by her mother, and resents her sister's decision to act like the perfect small-town girl her mother wants them to be, all while fighting against the small-town minds that force her to keep her best friend's secret. The thing is, this secret might be Astrid's, too; she just isn't sure yet. When everyone suddenly becomes interested in categorizing and labeling her, Astrid starts to feel like she's had enough. Only then, when she begins to understand and stand up for herself, does Astrid start to see that love is about more than just giving away. A.S. King tells a beautifully written and amazingly heartfelt story of a teenage girl who is frustrated with the world's attempts to put her in a neat little box, especially since she isn't quite sure how she would even define herself. Ask the Passengers is a story of acceptance, self-awareness, trust, love, and questioning--all themes familiar to any young adult, and which they will surely recognize in Astrid's strong voice. King also has a talent for showing just how complicated real teenagers' relationships--with friends, family, and significant others--can be. I cannot say enough good things about this novel. It's a coming of age story not to be missed.Stiefvater, Maggie. The Raven Boys. Scholastic. Sept. 2012. p. 416.     Blue has always lived with the paranormal--her mother and their housemates are all psychics, and Blue can amplify the psychic energy they use. And while her mother was never one for giving her rules, she's had one rule for herself for as long as she can remember: stay away from \"raven boys,\" her term for the privileged prep school boys who spend their school year in her town. One group of raven boys may be different, though. Sure, Gansey and Ronan have tons of money; but with their less stereotypically prep-school friends Adam and Noah, they are on a quest involving ley lines and a legendary Welsh king. When Blue sees Gansey's spirit as one marked for death, she feels somehow connected to him; and as she gets to know him and his friends better, it looks as though their fates may all be entwined. With fantastic multi-character narration, a deep and intriguing premise, and several whopper realizations, Maggie Stiefvater once again tells a thoroughly engrossing tale that the reader cannot help but become totally caught up in. The only negative thing I can say about this book is that we'll have to wait for three more in the series to be able to have the story in full.All books reviewed were advanced reader copies from the publishers; the final print versions may be different than the review copies."},
{"title": null, "date": "Wednesday, July 18, 2012", "text": "It's hot in Missouri in the summer. I was aware of that weather fact when, in late spring, I was finalizing my summer programming plans and scheduled four movie events. I had no idea, however, just how perfectly I had named these events until we had twelve consecutive days of 100+ temperatures. You see, I call these movie programs \"Beat the Heat Movie Treat.\" How perfect.On four Fridays during summer reading--two in June, two in July--I host the Beat the Heat Movie Treat programs. The premise is simple: show a movie from the library's collection for a program. This program format is directly in line with one of our programming goals, which is to utilize and promote the library's diverse collections. Just because movies are already popular, high-circulating items doesn't mean they shouldn't get a bit of programming time, too, I reason. Also, movie events like this make for some solid passive programming: minimal work, solid engagement and use of the collection.To maximize the appeal of these programs, I chose to screen the four children's movies with the highest numbers of reserve requests (That's Puss in Boots, Hugo, The Adventures of Tintin, and Alvin and the Chipmunks 3: Chipwrecked for us). My rationale in choosing these movies is twofold: 1) they are obviously popular and are thus recognizable, easy-to-promote titles; and 2) with so many reserve requests, a family can expect to have to wait a month or more before getting to borrow the movie from the library. Beat the Heat Movie Treat provides a way to see some popular movies without the wait time (so long as the movies are covered by your public performance license, of course!).Yum.Another big draw: we show the movie in a nicely air-conditioned room during the hottest part of the day. The large projection of the movie onto a big white wall makes the program akin to visiting the movie theatre, albeit for free. The movie is bigger than a viewer would get at home, the space is cool after a hot, humid morning... And we provide some snacks. Popcorn is a must, and lately I've been offering some small individually-wrapped candies or snack cakes, too, along with water and juice. As for seating, kids and their grown-ups decide whether they want to sit in chairs or stack sit-upon cushions on the ground in front of the screen. I also provide a selection of watch-alike films for check-out following the main attraction. Then, when the lights go down and the movie begins, it's 90-120 minutes of visual story, tasty snacks, and cool relaxation. Not a bad way to spend a library visit, I'd say."},
{"title": null, "date": "Monday, July 16, 2012", "text": "Smelly bears, animal motions, and a variety of trucks; that's what we've got going on at my library outreach story times this summer. I feel like creating program plans for summer story times can be difficult--kids have so much stimulation in the summertime that they don't necessarily have it in them to sit still for a thirty minute story time. What's a librarian to do, then? I opt for choosing stories that have high audience appeal and lots of opportunities for movement and interaction. Throw in some fun and familiar songs and rhymes, and maybe a craft and some bubbles, and all the little kids forget about the pool and the playground during story time.Opening Song: \"Open, Shut Them\"Story: Big Smelly Bear by Britta Teckentrup     Big Smelly Bear is big and smelly, and he likes being that way. Sometimes he wishes he had a friend, but other than those moments he is totally content. Totally content, that is, until he gets a horrendous itch on his back that he cannot scratch by himself. A fluffy bear remarks that she might help Big Smelly Bear if he would bathe first, and after a bit of persuading, Big Smelly Bear hops in the lake to clean off. Now he has no itch, not stench, and a new friend. This is a great silly story that gets lots of giggles, and it also doubles as support for why baths are important. A timely topic for a dusty summer, I think.Fingerplay: \"Where is Thumbkin?\"Story: From Head to Toe by Eric Carle     In lovely pictures with plenty of white space, Carle takes the reader through a list of common and popular animals and some of the actions they can do. The penguin can turn his head, the giraffe can bend his neck... and after each of these animals, the child is asked if he or she can imitate the movement. I like to have everyone stand up for this story, and we take our time going through it. By the end, we've made something of an animal action parade, with kids turning their necks, waving their arms, kicking their feet, and having all sorts of fun. Great story for wiggly ones, and it reinforces vocabulary along the way.Rhyme: \"I Am a Windshield Wiper\" (modified from Storytime Katie)I Am a Windshield WiperI am a windshield wiper (bend elbow atop other arm)And this is how I go (move arm up and down like a wiper)Back and forth, back and forth (continue wiper motion)To get rid of the rain and snow! (complete motion)Story: Tip Tip Dig Dig by Emma Garcia     This book is fantastic on several levels. One, it has a variety of trucks, and in my experience almost all young children love trucks. Two, it has repetitive words and motions for each truck, so the reading is interactive as kids say the words and do the motions along with the reader. Third, the story has direction; the story starts with a messy field, and during the story the trucks work to turn it into a beautiful park. I love to show the opening and closing picture spreads after we're done sharing the story so kids can really see the work the trucks accomplished.Craft: Garbage Trucks     Sticking with the final trucks theme, I have coloring sheets showing a large garbage truck for each child. I have crayons and colored pencils out for each child to color his or her garbage truck, and I also have glue sticks and scraps of tissue paper so kids can glue \"garbage\" onto their trucks. Kids love the versatility and open-endedness of this craft, and they love crumpling up the tissue paper, too. Moms and teachers appreciate how relatively simple yet fun the craft it.Bubbles!     For outreach story times that take place in the library branch, we often times conclude the story time by turning on our bubble machine. Kids flock to it, which means staff can begin to clean up after the craft. Since we use the bubble machine at the end of these sessions, it also signals to the children that story time is almost over--once the bubbles stop, they find mom or dad and head out into the library. The bubbles are lots of fun and help to frame the story time."},
{"title": null, "date": "Friday, July 13, 2012", "text": "Summer reading: the time of year when we encourage kids to meticulously count the number of books they read or the amount of time they spend reading. We mention that listening to audiobooks and listening to other people read aloud counts as reading, but does that option really register with them? What can I, the librarian, do to promote all sorts of reading among kids of all ages?Recent reads at Book Bunch Picnic LunchWell, for one thing, I can read to them. Who says story times have to stop after preschool? (Although calling it \"story time\" post-preschool age is a surefire way to massively limit school-age attendance.) I love listening to books read aloud, and all sorts of folks--teachers, researchers, literacy specialists--emphasize that school-age kids do, too. That's why I offer a series of programs during summer reading called Book Bunch Picnic Lunch.Our picnic areaBook Bunch Picnic Lunch is exactly what it sounds like: a bunch of kids and their grown-ups get together at lunchtime for a picnic, during which books are read. As the librarian, I do the reading. I also provide drinks and dessert, so kids need only come equipped with a sack lunch. I spread out a tablecloth on the program room floor (no ants), set out sit-upon cushions for comfort and personal space, and pick some treats--of both the sweet and story kind. Then, for a full hour, I read to the kids gathered around our picnic space.Drinks!I read a variety of things. I choose funny picture books that are guaranteed to get some giggles, and I read longer picture books that are nominated for the state award for first through third graders. I read chapters and excerpts from longer books, both fiction and nonfiction. I even read some of my all-time favorite things in librarian read-aloud history, including Miss Nelson is Missing and \"The Great Mouse Plot\" from Roald Dahl's autobiography Boy (I would be remiss if I didn't mention that reading this chapter aloud has been one of my librarian dreams ever since seeing Meg Ryan read it as the Storybook Lady in You've Got Mail). I always have a variety of books piled around me so I can offer the picnickers options. If they become bored of a tale, we move to something else; if they really enjoy another, they can all crowd around the pictures.Desserts!If you do as I do and buy drinks and treats from the dollar bin at the grocery store, this program provides a very effective bang for your buck. It is always such a pleasure to have older children sitting rapt with attention, so enthralled they stop chewing, at a story that has grabbed them; and parents are always keen to say what a luxury it is to have someone else do the reading for a change. Kids make recommendations for the sorts of stories I should read aloud next time, and sure enough, they're at the next Book Bunch Picnic Lunch to see if I've chosen their recommended titles. This program inspires a dedicated following of participants, and the kids actively look forward to the next session. They tell me they would still attend even if they didn't get to count the time as reading on their SRP booklogs. That's praise."},
{"title": null, "date": "Thursday, July 12, 2012", "text": "Librarians, I have found, love lists. There's something satisfying about an ordered compilation of information to those of us who are inclined to categorize and organize. To good librarians, though, lists are a lot more than attractive, accessible bits of information: lists are remarkably useful tools.Lists have helped me to perform my job better on more occasions than I could reasonably expect to remember. I go to lists of Youth Media Award winners when I'm looking for outstanding children's media across the decades; I go to ALA's lists of frequently challenged books (organized by year, author, frequency of challenges, etc.) when I am preparing displays on censorship or for Banned Books Week; and I use the yearly Notables lists to assess my branch's collection and whether I am offering my young readers access to the best materials. In both the children's and young adult departments of my branch, we use the lists of books nominated for Missouri Readers Awards to order and display the books that local teachers encourage their students to read. And goodness knows we'd be in serious trouble if we didn't have in our collections the books on the weekly NYT and independent bestsellers lists! Without all of these lists, we'd have plenty of kids, teens, and adults coming into the library and then leaving empty-handed because we hadn't anticipated demand. Lists help librarians make sure we have what our customers want to read, and they help guide us in displaying these highly-desire items.Lists do a lot more, however, than just inform collection development and influence where we display items. Lists are a HUGE help in providing quality readers' advisory services, especially when you work a shared reference desk. I read a lot of juvenile and teen literature, but I cannot rely on my own reading knowledge when an adult who loves mysteries comes to the desk asking for some reading suggestions. Instead, I look once again to lists: lists of Read Alikes from NoveList; genre awards lists; the LibraryThing book tag word clouds and recommendations for a favorite or recently-enjoyed title. The list of lists, as it were, could go on and on. All of these lists help me and my colleagues to serve our customers better.Ah, customers. It always comes back to them, right? Have you noticed that customers love lists, too? I have tons of library regulars of all ages who will gobble up anything and everything that is on a list, so long as they deem that list reputable. They don't necessarily want to read everything on their aunt's best-reads list, but they will happily read everything that a favorite book blogger or author recommends. Knowing the sorts of recommended reading lists that are out there and offering them to your patrons can be a great way to engage voracious readers and reach out to customers who don't come to the reference desk to ask for help choosing a book (indirect RA, yay!). A few lists we're currently loving at my library:the Neil Gaiman Presents audiobook collectionbooks with many genres and appeals proven to have been enjoyed by young male readers, on the Guys Read websitethe Top 100 Picture Books, according to a massive poll via School Library Journal's \"A Fuse #8 Production\"the Top 100 Chapter Books, also from SLJ and Fuse #8Last but not least, lists can help librarians with more than just their books. They can help with ideas, with programming, and with all of the odds-and-ends bits of any library job. Online College.org just updated their list of the 100 Best Blogs for School Librarians--and really, this list of phenomenal blogs, curated by broad topic, is applicable to anyone who works with kids and teens in any setting. I've only spent a small amount of time looking through some of the listed blogs, but already I've added a number of them to my Google Reader. There are some real winners on that list.There are so many ideas for librarians out there, folks. All of that information and inspiration could easily become overwhelming, but luckily for us so much of it is compiled into organized, thoughtful, lovely, and accessible lists.What are some of your go-to lists that help you shine at your job?"},

With so many monthly programs and outreach story times, it's important to stay up to date and to keep things fresh! Here are three titles I'm looking forward to using in my story times once they're released.Levinthal, David. Who Pushed Humpty Dumpty?: And Other Notorious Nursery Tale Mysteries. illus. by John Nickle. Schwartz & Wade. Sept. 2012. p. 40.     Officer Binky the frog solves nursery crimes, from who broke into the three bears' house to who poisoned Snow White. With a noir voice and a healthy dose of fractured fairy tale humor, this picture book engages readers familiar with nursery stories in a new, funny way. The illustrations add their own brand of humor to the whole, making for a fun read-aloud for a young school-age crowd.Smith, Maggie. Pigs in Pajamas. illus. by author. Knopf BFYR. Dec. 2012. p. 32.     When Penelope Pig hosts a sleepover party, all her piggy friends don their pajamas and head to her house for an evening of fun. The gently rhyming texts is playful, and the emphasis of words beginning with the letter \"p\" will appeal to parents as well as preschoolers. The illustrations are a great combination of painting and photo collage, and young readers will get lots of enjoyment from trying to spot all of the \"p\" objects scattered throughout. Sure to be a great read-aloud.Yaccarino, Dan. Doug Unplugged. illus. by author. Knopf BFYR. Feb. 2013. p. 40.     Doug is a young robot who learns everything he knows via download. One day, as he is downloading facts about the city, he decides to unplug and follow a pigeon. Suddenly Doug is exploring the wonders of the city firsthand, and he enjoys every moment of it. Yaccarino's bright, fanciful illustrations perfectly suit the simple, joyous story of Doug's discovery of the world and what he learns in it. Pair with Boy + Bot for a fun robot-themed story time.All three picture books were viewed through Edelweiss, an online interactive, multi-publisher catalog with ARC review capabilities for librarians and other professionals.

Imagine if a bona fide celebrity visited your library. People would flock to your branch, right? That's exactly what happened at my branch not that long ago, when we had one of the biggest celebrities make an appearance at an evening family story time.That's right. We got Curious George.They're so excited to see Curious George!\"Booking\" celeb visitors for your library programs isn't actually all that difficult. You really just need to find a costumed character that your kids love and that your library feels you can afford. Lots of costumed characters come at a flat fee for about a week stay at your library; which means if your character visits several branches, the relative cost keeps going down, down, down. And when you consider just how many kids will show up, very excited, to see your celebrity guest? Yeah, it's totally worth it.Building a program around a celebrity visit is pretty simple, too; after all, the kids are excited to get to the meet-and-greet portion of the program. Whenever a celebrity visits my library--Max from the Max and Ruby books has also made an appearance this year--I plan a simple three-step lead-in to the character's arrival. We always start with my opening song, \"Open, Shut Them,\" since a room crowded with kids full of anticipatory fidgets can be quite noisy. Then I read aloud a (hopefully) brief story featuring our celeb of the moment (in George's case, Curious George Visits the Library, with a few pages paper-clipped together). Finally we sing a song, which usually gets loud enough to signal to our celebrity guest that it's time to come into the program room. When George visited recently, we had a rousing rendition of \"Five Little Monkeys.\" Let's just say it's a good thing our quiet rooms are way on the other side of the library.And then Curious George came in. Applause! Giggles! Waving hello! After I introduced George and helped him to his seat, I invited families to make a line to meet him and get a picture with him. Since we always have 50+ kids at these celebrity story times, I make sure to have plenty of activities to keep them busy until it's their turn to meet the character. With Curious George, we had tables with Curious George coloring sheets (from the PBS website), a yellow hat craft, and a swinging monkeys craft. Sure, there was a lot going on at once during that latter half of the program, but everyone was engaged and having a good time. And by the time the last child left the program room, having gotten a picture with Curious George and clutching a variety of Curious George craft swag, the program felt like a total success.It's not every day you can have a whirlwind program resulting in so many happy kids with relatively little staff and materials cost. Just another reason to think outside the book and consider inviting your favorite characters to visit your library."},
{"title": null, "date": "Friday, July 6, 2012", "text": "I've been reading a lot of middle grade fiction since returning from ALA. I picked up a variety of middle grade galleys, and my goal has been to read them before I give them away as prizes during an upcoming lock-in (more on that in August, I promise). I'd say I'm making good progress so far, especially considering how many of these titles I've been adding to my mock Newbery list. Take a look:Stead, Rebecca. Liar & Spy. Wendy Lamb Books. Aug. 2012. p. 208.     Georges and his family have just moved from his childhood home into an apartment, and the fact that the move has kept him in the same neighborhood of Brooklyn where he's always lived doesn't make it any easier. Georges feels picked on at school, but in his hours at home he befriends Safer, a boy his age who lives upstairs and who has undertaken a spy mission. As Georges gets involved in Safer's increasingly risky surveillance scheme, he starts to adjust to his new normal and learn what it takes to stick up for himself--with bullies, with classmates, with friends, and with his family. This wonderful story is equal parts funny, suspenseful, and heartfelt, and it is a superb coming-of-age tale that will appeal to both male and female middle grade readers.Bauer, Joan. Almost Home. Viking. Sept. 2012. p. 272.     Sugar is really enjoying her English class at school; her teacher, Mr. Bennett, is encouraging her to write, and her poetry has started helping her work through her less-than-perfect home situation. When she and her mother are evicted from their house, however, Sugar has to switch schools; the homeless shelter is too far from where she started the year. Things get much worse for Sugar before there is any hope on the horizon: after moving to Chicago and not getting a job she was counting on, Sugar's mother has a mental breakdown, leaving Sugar at the mercy of Social Services in this new city. As Sugar meets people who have her best interests at heart, her poetry takes on a whole new, strong voice. Sugar is a beautifully developed character, and her thoughts and poems had me absolutely spellbound. Readers who enjoy tales of triumph over hardship (think Love, Aubrey or Wonder) will surely enjoy this magnificent novel, which I'm pegging for Newbery consideration.Oliver, Lauren. The Spindlers. illus. by Iacopo Bruno. Harper. Sept. 2012. p. 246.     Liza's younger brother Patrick is acting strangely, and Liza knows what that means: the spindlers have stolen his soul. Her beloved babysitter, who first told Liza and Patrick about the spindlers, is away at college, so Liza must go \"below\" on her own in order to save Patrick. Along the way she encounters a number of fanciful creatures and threatening situations, all culminating with the difficult tests set in front of her by the spindler queen. This middle grade fantasy novel is full of adventure and themes of loyalty, and it has a decidedly Alice feel to it--in a good way.L'Engle, Madeleine. A Wrinkle in Time: The Graphic Novel. illus. by Hope Larson. Farrar Strous Giroux. Oct. 2012. p. 392.     \"It was a dark and stormy night.\" To a children's librarian, these opening words are iconic. A Wrinkle in Time has long been a classic, and with reason: it is a suspenseful, compelling story about fighting for those you love as well as for yourself, and it includes some serious science without ever sounding dumbed down (L'Engle is famous for taking kids and their powers of understanding seriously). This graphic novel version of the classic Newbery winner captures all that is wonderful about the original while adding in beautiful, sometimes playful and sometimes ominous illustrations. This graphic edition will be well-loved by fans of L'Engle's Time Quintet, and it will help introduce Meg and Charles-Wallace Murray and Calvin O'Keefe to a variety of new readers.Lin, Grace. Starry River of the Sky. illus. by the author. Little, Brown and Company. Oct. 2012. p. 294.     Rendi has stowed away in a wine merchant's cart, but when he is discovered, he is forced to become the chore boy at the Inn of Clear Sky. He hates his situation until a mysterious woman comes to stay at the inn: Madame Chang, who tells beautiful stories. With the help of Madame Chang's folk tales and the kindness of his new living companions, Rendi starts to comprehend his own story--as well as his own role in it. With the help of beautiful illustrations, Lin creates a lovely narrative populated with short and wonderful folk stories. This novel is about discovering who you are deep down, and it also serves as a marvelous look into traditional Chinese storytelling culture. Perfect for middle grade readers who want to be transported to a new, yet not too fantastical, place when they read.All books reviewed were advanced reader copies from the publishers; the final print versions may be different than the review copies."},

That means we've drawn the names of the winners of the Cardinals tickets drawing (an incentive for signing up in the first month), and we've started making serious dents in our boxes of prizes. And while we haven't seen the onslaught of families running to the summer reading station that we did that first week, we have had a steady stream of enthusiastic kids coming to claim their prizes and talk about what they've been reading. Participation is high, and there have been lots of people in the library. Which means we might have had total chaos if not for our summer reading volunteers.I've been so impressed by our volunteers, who are all teens; they always act professionally and represent the library well. When our volunteers have had downtime--and that does happen for stretches of each shift--they've been doing a great job of staying engaged and not looking bored. I emphasize that summer reading volunteers can read during the slow times, counting that reading toward their own summer reading goals. I've had a few great what-I've-been-reading conversations with these volunteers in these quieter moments, and I was excited to get to promote some upcoming titles during these talks. (I even mentioned that some of the most coveted ARCs will be available as prizes at our upcoming district-wide TAB lock-in... Woot!)A few volunteers who are skilled organizers and multitaskers have even taken on the responsibility of restocking SRP supplies and preparing program crafts for children's staff. Suffice it to say, these summer reading volunteers have been a huge help. They are very much earning the volunteer appreciation party awaiting them after the close of summer reading...

And then I work it into my programming. This week: patriotic crafts!Patriotic Paper LanternsThe take-home craft at my branch for July is a patriotic paper lantern. It's an easily adaptable craft, and it requires minimal supplies. Our craft packets, which customers can pick up as they check out their materials, include a full sheet of paper (in red, white, or blue), two small sheets of stars (also in red, white, and/or blue), and a sheet of instructions. All of the cutting and pasting happens at home. These crafts have been flying off the shelves. Must be because the demo is so cute! My colleague did a fantastic job of selecting a fun, simple, skills-promoting craft and making it look beyond appealing to everyone passing the library's circulation desk.Patriotic SpinnersOur second crafternoon of the summer is a patriotic spinner. Didn't you love playing with spinners when you were young? You know, the kind with a bird on one side and a birdcage on the other, and when the spinner was spinning the bird was magically in the birdcage? I adapted that classic spinner to fit a patriotic theme for our walk-in craft. Our craft tables will be supplied with the spinner templates printed on cardstock; crayons for coloring them; scissors for cutting them out; glue sticks for pasting the two sides together; hole punches for punching holes; and yarn for creating the spinner handles. The goal for these crafternoons is to provide a craft that will engage and delight all ages of kids, from preschool through early teens. When you consider the relative simplicity of the craft combined with the sheer amount of enjoyment my staff have gotten from playing with my demo spinner, I would guess we have a winner."},

It's got fun, nonsense, book-to-movie goodness (both cartoon and live action!), rhymes, imagination, curiosity...all things, in my experience working with children, that draw kids to a story. So why not, I figured, offer an Alice in Wonderland-themed program for the summer preschool and school-age crowd? Our own golden afternoon, as it were?Why not, indeed. It was certainly apparent that kids were interested in a Mad Hatter's Tea Party--within about 30 hours of registration opening for the initial program, our roster was full with a substantial waiting list. I opted to open up a second session of the program on the same day; same snacks, same games and craft, but twice the happy attendees. This decision ended up being a good call, as the second session filled up pretty quickly, too. The high demand filled both the programs, which made them extremely high-energy and lots of fun.

Our library has a stash of old china saucers, and I used these as serving dishes for watermelon and a variety of cookies. I pre-portioned everything for easier handling by attendees of all ages. I asked a few moms who came in the room to help me pour the drinks--Sunny Delight, in a variety of flavors--and within a few minutes of starting the tables of funnily be-hatted kids were all achatter. Some came with friends, some on their own, so I encouraged them to turn to a neighbor to say \"How do you do?\" and shake hands (get it?!). I then prompted them to share what they've been reading for summer reading. As I went around each table playing hostess, I was able to greet everyone and get an update on SRP progress.After about 15 minutes of snacks and chat, all of the stragglers had arrived, so we segued into some Alice-themed nonsense. We had tongue twister races, and lots of kids offered their favorite tongue twisters for group trial. I also recited my favorite Alice poem (\"How doth the little crocodile\"), which they seemed to get a kick out of.Then, games! We had a caucus race (musical chairs, albeit played with sit-upon cushions instead of chairs for easier use with such a large number of kids), and I used an Alice soundtrack to source the game music. Next we played The Queen of Hearts Says (Simon Says), which needed a bit of initial explaining for some of the youngest program attendees. A few of them struggled with the concept of the game, so in my second program I opted to let an older girl play the Queen of Hearts. Lots of the girls giggled at how bad I am at the game (which I was not faking), and once Miss Amy was sitting out, not winning didn't seem quite as big a deal.With about 20 minutes left in the hour-long program, we all moved back to our tables for a craft. I had the children clear their tables in exchange for their craft supplies--a tip I learned working meals at summer camp--so the tables were an open canvas for craft creativity. Our mission: to create an army of mome raths. I adapted the linked craft to use rainbow-colored popsicle sticks (instead of painting our own), and we also used pipe cleaners in place of feathers to cut down on a sticky feather mess. All ages of the children got really into the creation of their mome raths--some made theirs hats, some appendages, some clothing... I always love how the simplest crafts promote the most variety of creations among children.As the kids finished up their mome raths, I thanked them very much for coming to the program. Everyone who left the Mad Hatter's Tea Party was all smiles. And there's nothing curious about that."},

I head back to the library tomorrow, and I'm fairly certain that with summer reading, programs, outreach, etc., it'll soon feel as though I was never away.Except for all of the ideas, of course.It is a bit difficult for my brain to as yet fully comprehend how much I learned at the 2012 ALA Annual Conference. I feel confident that over the coming weeks--as I reread my notes, talk with colleagues and friends, start putting small ideas into action--I'll get a sense for the true potential of all I've heard in Anaheim. Right now my plan is to think more about play and toys in the library (watch for details on a play initiative that's been in the works since way before ALA!), how accessible my collections are to young customers, more engaging book talks on new titles with child and teen readers, and science programming options. I think that should keep me busy for a bit, right?I want to end my #ala12 posts by saying how inspiring I found not only all of my new librarian friends--you do some amazing things!--but each and every author I spoke with during the conference as well. These talented men and women value the written word and the worth of a story...that much should be obvious, given their line of work. But so many authors spoke strongly about the value of libraries in bringing words and stories to people. They talked about the power of libraries to help form young people into interesting, well-spoken, thoughtful, and dedicated citizens of humanity.I would be lying if I said I didn't appreciate these words from such amazing, influential people. When Corey Whaley ended his Printz speech with an entreaty to #SaveALibrary, because they matter so much? Powerful. And I am so glad to see just how many folks share that sentiment."},
{"title": null, "date": "Sunday, June 24, 2012", "text": "Sunday evening just before the Newbery-Caldecott banquet, I attended a program called \"I WANT A TRUCK BOOK! Reorganizing Your Picture Book Collection to Meet the Needs of Young Patrons and their Caregivers.\"  The three fantastic presenters were Gretchen Caserotti of Darien Library (CT), Deborah Cooper of Stark County (OH) Library District, and Tali Balas Kaplan of the Ethical Culture Fieldston School in NYC. All three have recently converted some of their children's collections to a non-Dewey, broad category organization.How does your library organize the books for children? Dewey for nonfiction, alphabetical order (perhaps with some age ranging) for fiction? That seems to be the default for almost every American library that serves children, be it public or school. But does it need to be? There are some good arguments for reevaluating how you organize your materials, books for young readers in particular:People don't really understand library coding systems. What does that \"J\" stand for? What is going on with the Dewey Decimal System? Studies show that most people never really learn the way libraries traditionally organize their collections, and they instead just memorize where in the building and on the shelf they can find what they like. Too bad if the library rearranges things.Libraries have two types of users: seekers and browsers. Seekers will be able to find what they want no matter the organizational scheme. Browsers, on the other hand, have a very hard time finding what they want on their own when using traditional systems. Why not employ a system that promotes findability and discoverability?Asking kids in particular to use traditional library organizational schemes to find books is massively developmentally inappropriate. Alphabetical and numerical order are very abstract concepts to kids, and that's once we've already assumed the book-seekers in question can read. Then there's Dewey--kids don't learn decimals until the fifth grade. We're making it rather difficult for our target audience to get their hands on the books we purchase for them.Having books organized in a fashion that makes sense to kids facilitates the development of their own categorization skills. Figuring out how to put things in the appropriate bucket, as it were, is a key step in intellectual development.The librarians who presented in favor of reorganizing children's collections all decided that the complications of traditional systems made finding books much too difficult for kids, and as a result they developed their own organizational schemes. Some are comprehensive, some comprise just certain aspects of their collections. Whatever specific methods they employed, the recategorized books saw huge increases in circulation. Kids and caregivers both overwhelmingly reported that it was now so much easier to find what they wanted. Isn't that part of the point of providing library services for children? When we're working with kids and often-frazzled grown-ups, shouldn't one of our customer service goals be to make finding things easier?What are your thoughts on non-traditional and homegrown organizations of kids' books?"},

All these ladies are basically rock stars of library design.Think about the community where you live. How many spaces are there in the community for adults? Starbucks, shopping centers, restaurants, theaters... Now think about how many spaces there are specifically for children. Maybe the YMCA, the play place at McDonald's, a park or two. How awful is that, that kids don't have more spaces in which they can play? Why not make the library one such destination?It's true that not all libraries can afford to completely revamp their children's spaces. Luckily, there are some simpler, cost-effective strategies for redesigning the kids area right now. Tips I'm taking to heart:You already have space in your library for toys and interactives. Can't find it? WEED! Weed everything that doesn't circ, everything that's gross, everything that doesn't fit the collection... If you weed discriminately and deliberately, you'll end up with space for play and a more customer-friendly collection.Make sure to include seating options for kids and adults. Without adult seating, parents don't engage with their kids. They also feel like they can drop their kids off and go elsewhere in the library when there is no obvious place for them to share the space.The simpler the toy, the more complex the learning. Bring out the blocks or play food, which can be used in a myriad of ways by all ages of children. More complex toys often take up more space and only have one mode of use, thus promoting more limited learning outcomes.Observe your children's space from a child's perspective. Kneel or sit on the ground and see what a two- or three-year-old would see when interacting at the library. Put age appropriate things at an age appropriate level. Add color and interest where they'll see it.I learned a lot more in this session, and I'll be spending some time in the next few days processing all of my thoughts about how I can enhance the children's space I currently have at my branch. What works for engaging children's spaces at your library?"},

It's a library that is all science, all the time. Amazing! I agree that cultural institutions like libraries do children a service when they offer science programming and activities, and it's a personal goal to make science a fundamental part of kids' experiences at my branch. And while we're not all lucky enough to have a space like the Queens Discovery Center, that doesn't mean we can't mix science into the bunch! A few ideas from today's session:Connect hands-on science stations or science activity sheets in the branch with the Dewey stacks. For example, with a butterfly activity, have a sign leading to the 595s. Similarly, have a sign by the butterfly books suggesting the activity.Focus on doing science with the kids as opposed to instructing them. It's not school! Be hands-on.Reinforce skills associated with science: observation, measuring, estimation, etc. For example, have kids describe or draw the development of a growing plant over the summer.Get teens to help--children are excited by young people who enthusiastically share science with them.Need ideas? Look to educational standards for topics and the internet for hands-on activities.My library has an airplane science program coming up later this summer, and in the meantime I intend to think of informal ways to add science activities in the branch. What are some of your successes and/or ideas?"},
{"title": null, "date": "Saturday, June 23, 2012", "text": "Saturday morning I attended an ALSC-sponsored program entitled \"You Want Me to Circ WHAT?! or How to Best Utilize Toys as a Literacy Tool in Programs and as a Fun Part of Your Lending Collection.\"Mr. Rogers is credited with the phrase \"Play is the work of childhood.\" A grand statement, and one libraries can use to inform programs and collections--especially in light of the revised Every Child Ready to Read, which includes play as one of the five practices to promote early literacy. Toys are a great, child-approved way to integrate play into the library, and this session had quite a few ideas for making that happen:No space is too small for incorporating toys into the library. Whether you have a room, a playhouse, a closet, a table, or just a bit of room under some shelves, you can add toys successfully. Wall panels work, too.A small selection of toys is just as beneficial as a huge variety. A child engages with one toy at a time, so a box of puzzles is just as satisfying to a child as a roomful of different items.Have programs that highlight play and give plenty of opportunities for kids to play with the library's toys. Start off with a short book and a song, then spend the rest of the program letting kids and caregivers go to play stations. Ideas include playdoh, blocks, letters, etc., all with brief instructions for interacting with the toys.Adapt activities for older children, too; they also benefit cognitively from play, and making play a family affair does more to ensure play will continue outside of the library. Supporting play outside of the library is another great reason to have toys in the library, as families can take home new things they might not get to play with otherwise.How does your library bring toys and play into the library?"},
{"title": null, "date": "Saturday, June 23, 2012", "text": "Friday evening I attended a Booklist session titled \"Men at Work: Guy Writers Talk Guy Readers.\" A panel of speakers shared some of their thoughts on getting boys reading.Boys read. As librarians, we know that's a fact. Research does indicate, however, that boys typically don't read as much or as well as girls the same age, and as a result they can start to fall behind in competency. Some great male writers, whom readers of both genders love, gave their perspectives on why getting more boys reading is necessary and how we might accomplish that goal. Here are the highlights of what Jon Scieszka, Michael Grant, Andrew Smith, and Daniel Handler had to say.Start by asking boys what they want to read. Listen to what they say, and note what are the heavy circ-ing titles.Escapism has value in encouraging reading. Is the book one they'd be willing to spend time with?There are a few dirty words when it comes to encouraging reading: \"appropriate,\" which casts judgment; and \"for,\" which excludes potential readers (e.g., books FOR boys, books FOR teens).Speaking of dirty words, teen boys in particular like their books to have racy and dirty bits. To the young male reader, these parts are value-added, but censorship-happy adults view even short instances of language and sex as rendering the whole book objectionable.Some boys don't read, but there are plenty of clandestine male readers, too. The prevalence of readers who hide their enjoyment of reading suggests there's something fundamentally wrong with our reading culture. This fact could shed light on the whole issue of boys and reading.How do you engage young male readers at your library?"},
{"title": null, "date": "Friday, June 22, 2012", "text": "My first session of the 2012 ALA Annual Conference was Intellectual Freedom 101, an informational program put on by ALA's Office of Intellectual Freedom. The program hit the highlights of what the OIF does to support the fundamental freedom for folks to read, view, think, and express whatever they want: there's the annual Banned Books Week, an annual Choose Privacy Week, a database on book challenges, policy and procedure best practices... All sorts of initiatives and information to support libraries who support customers' library rights. In my experience, the biggest intellectual freedom issue when working with children is censorship, or the potential for censorship. It can take many forms: the parent or teacher who won't let a child read a particular book because they deem it inappropriate or unsuitable for some reason, sometimes without having read the book themselves; a person who wants particular items removed entirely from the collection so that no child has access to them, again sometimes without having read said items; from library staff who may hesitate to recommend or check out a particular item to a young library customer because of their personal views or experience with the item; and even from library materials selectors who refrain from purchasing certain materials in order to preemptively avoid potential challenges. Hopefully your library has policies in place to deal with formal materials challenges and to inform staff behaviors with regards to library materials and young readers--but what about those parents who voice their \"is this appropriate?\" concerns in the library? How do you preserve intellectual freedom on the spot? I'm interested to know how you respond to these situations, and I'll go ahead and share my most common responses. First and foremost, I come right out and say that I believe a child has the same freedom to read as any other library user--if a kid wants to read it and we have access to it in the library, I will give it to the kid. I state this without judgment, as it is the parent's position, not mine, to monitor a child's reading. Then I give the parent the power to decide how they want to support the child and his or her interests:   Does the parent think the material is too thematically mature? Violence, relationships, language, etc.? I cite that stories with elements that challenge children have been found to benefit them and develop their understanding of the world, but not promote the behaviors themselves. Is the parent concerned the child can't work through the elements on his or her own? Then read the book together! So many families have come back to tell me that, after reading a book together that they had thought would be inappropriate, they had great family discussions and strengthened both their relationships and their love of reading.Does the parent think the material is too scary? I point out that research shows encountering frightening situations within the boundaries of a story helps children to work through their fears in a safe, non-threatening setting. And again, discussion after reading a story can do wonders for ensuring that story leaves a positive impact.Does the parent have concerns because of what they've heard about an item from friends, religious groups, television, etc.? In these situations, I have found that my opinion doesn't count for much--why should a parent trust me, a relatively unknown person, over a voice whom they trust? Instead I provide some options for finding out what people in the know have to say. What age range does School Library Journal recommend as the readers? Has Booklist cited any potential red zones? I am careful to use only reputable library resources--the same ones we use when deciding what materials to purchase for the collection. A critical opinion can do wonders for putting a parent's mind at ease.How do you repond to parent concerns? How have intellectual freedom and serving children overlapped in your library?"},

When I attended in New Orleans last year, I was actively looking for a job. As a result, I spread out the types of sessions I attended to make myself more marketable (some kids, some teen, some adult), and I went to quite a few networking events and resume/interview workshops. I loved ALA last year--LOVED it. So many interesting people, so many great ideas, so many fabulous authors and events... This year, though, I'm very excited to be experiencing #ala12 from my position of a children's librarian who is in charge of all things children's at a branch.In no particular order, here are the top five things I'm looking forward to at this year's conference:The sessions and workshops -- I have already gotten lots of enjoyment out of perusing the session and workshop offerings for the conference. So far I've scheduled myself to attend a handful of science programming sessions, an Every Child Ready to Read program, and a session on maximizing volunteer contributions. I am ready to learn a LOT, and I plan to bring tons of ideas back to my branch and my colleagues.Live blogging the conference on the ALSC Blog -- I'm going to be one of the folks live blogging the conference this year! Once or twice a day, I'll post some shorter pieces on the ALSC blog that mention highlights of the conference and the sessions I attend, etc. I love following live blog postings for conferences I can't attend, and I'm very excited to contribute to the live blogging this year.The Newbery/Caldecott Banquet and the Printz Reception -- I love the whole idea of award-winning books; I read tons of Newbery winners when I first got into chapter books, and those shiny medals really draw a lot of young readers to some great titles. I'll be attending the Newbery/Caldecott Banquet, where Jack Gantos and Chris Raschka will speak, as well as the Printz Reception, where the 2012 Printz Award and Honor winners will share some words of wisdom and humor. These events are like the Oscars of the conference for children's and YA librarians, and I am psyched to attend.Meeting authors -- Lots of authors are at the conference to promote their work, do signings, and participate in panels and sessions. I am most looking forward to meeting Daniel Handler (a.k.a. Lemony Snicket) and saying \"hi\" to Peter Brown, who did an author event at my library last September.The exhibit hall -- The exhibit hall at this conference is beyond crazy, folks. Crazy in a very, very good way. There are exhibits of publishers, library vendors, furniture folks, and everything you could possibly imagine as related to libraries. It's fun to get some of the advance reader copies (ARCs) of forthcoming books from publishers, but I also look forward to exploring some of the furniture and supply options that I could add in my branch. Also, I'm on the hunt for a really great animal puppet. Fingers crossed I'll be successful.It's going to be a great conference, I can feel it! I hope you're looking forward to following along."},

After his aunt gets a feeling about the end of the war nearing, she sends Levi on a train to the South to meet up with his father on his military base. The rural South is a much different place than urban Chicago, and Levi comes face to face with the harsh realities of racial prejudice. While he does not find his father at the base, his does meet up with one of his father's fellow soldiers--and Levi learns that his father's claims of jumping out of airplanes are in fact true. His father is one of the Tuskegee Airmen.Throughout this thoughtful, moving historical novel, Levi travels the country, becomes acquainted with the kind and not-so-kind characters in the world, and learns the true meaning of honor. Levi's young, developing voice makes for compelling and interesting narration, and the reader really gets a feel for what Levi goes through emotionally during the summer his life entirely changes course. Readers of historical and military fiction will love the rich detail of the novel, but all young readers who enjoy developing a relationship with a character will find this a captivating read.Jump Into the Sky will be released by Alfred A.

Sometimes, they are literally running around the library--the children's section in particular. Lots of librarians have great ideas on how to capitalize on this captive summer audience of library kids. At some point in the past, one of the women who held my job before me decided that if the kids are going to be running amok in the library during the hot summer months, they may as well acquaint themselves with where things are located. Thus was born the Summer Seek and Find, now a much-loved summer tradition at my branch.During each of the nine weeks of summer reading, families who come into the library are greeted with our Summer Seek and Find sign. On that sign, a large picture of a children's book character is displayed. The goal, then, is for kids to find the corresponding small picture of said character somewhere in the children's area of the library. When they find the character, they report its location to the reference desk for a small prize (a piece of candy, a Dream Big READ tattoo, etc.). Keep in mind that my branch doesn't have a huge children's section; we've got a 15'x15' area with picture books on three sides, four aisles of juvenile fiction, an aisle of juvenile audiovisual, and three aisles of juvenile nonfiction. What I'm saying is, there aren't too many places that these characters can hide. This activity is not meant to be particularly difficult.It is, however, meant to introduce kids of all ages to the various collections housed in the children's area. For our first week this summer, Kipper was hiding out in the juvenile biographies. Last week the Man in the Yellow Hat was hanging out by our holiday picture books. That's two collections kids might not have known about! And, after completing the Summer Seek and Find, now they do. Bam! Library skills.This week kids are searching for Martha the dog, and while you can see she's hiding amidst the chapter books, we don't let kids get the prize just for sharing that general piece of information. We ask for a more specific description--what books are nearby? what are some of the authors around her? what does the aisle sign read for that row of shelves? The goal is for kids to become more acquainted with the library's set-up and variety of resources, and we try to encourage seekers to look at their surroundings as they seek. Sure, a few kids grumble as we send them back into the stacks to take more notice of a character's location, but plenty more kids end up choosing a book from the area around a hidden character. There are even more young pre-readers who are thrilled to look for a much-loved character somewhere in the library. Everyone who participates in the Summer Seek and Find gets something out of it.I highly recommend giving the Summer Seek and Find a chance at your library. It doesn't take a whole lot of work--print the signs and pictures, create tally sheets if you want to keep statistics, and change the character and hiding place every week. Ta-da! Now you've got 400+ kids who learn something new about the library each week. Add that to all the reading they're doing for the SRP, and the library is definitely keeping kids' brains engaged during these hot summer months."},

I must say, though, that while I'm glad to be able to pick up some other books for the next few weeks, this batch of a dozen titles is really great--there's something for every older elementary reader.The Familiars by Adam Jay Epstein and Andrew Jacobson is the story of Aldwyn, a stray alley cat who, through a series of evasive maneuvers and a bit of luck, finds himself chosen as the familiar of a young wizard. Despite his total lack of magical ability, Aldwyn has quite a bit of skill--which comes in handy when it appears the sorceress queen of the land has taken a turn toward evil. After the three young wizards whom they accompany are kidnapped, Aldwyn and his new friends go on an adventure of their own in order to rescue the children. And hopefully they'll thwart some evil along the way. This story is fast-paced, has characters with strong personalities, and takes place in a world ready for an imaginative reader. I'll be recommending this title to readers who enjoy fantasy, adventure, and animal tales.Twenty Gold Falcons by Amy Gordon follows Aiden Farmer, who after the death of her father has recently relocated from her farm in Minnesota to the city in which her mother grew up. Aiden isn't a huge fan of this move--she's met some bratty kids at her private school, her mother seems too occupied with returning to her previous city life, and she misses the comforts of her familiar farm life. Everyone at the Ingle Building is friendly to her, though, and soon she finds out about some gold coins--twenty gold falcons--that are likely still hidden in its walls. Aiden thinks that finding the coins can allow her to buy back her farm, so she enlists the help of a classmate and a cousin to try to discover their secret hiding place. Along the way, she makes a few friends, gets into a few sticky situations, and learns a lot more about herself and her family than she could have expected. This book would be great for readers who don't quite feel like they fit in, as Aiden thoughtfully narrates how she feels about being in a new place where she feels alone. I'll be recommending Twenty Gold Falcons to readers who enjoy a bit of mystery as well as those who are looking for a soft-spoken character to relate to."},

Since dads joining their children for a library outing happens much less frequently than, say, outings with moms or grandparents, though, I really love seeing kids' excitement as they get to share the library and their favorite stories with their dads. For this very reason, I try to encourage male role models to bring their children into the library. I always mention moms and dads when talking about interacting with little ones in my baby programs, and I offer programming that kids and dads tend to enjoy: science, for one; a monthly Lego club; and Star Wars. The possibilities are many, and the benefits of involving all members of the family at the library are even greater.Even when dads can't make it to the library, though, I've noticed that kids LOVE talking about them. After many a story time and craft, children have come up to me to report how excited they are to tell Dad what they did at the library. Dads are a part of the library no matter what. Thus, in this week leading up to Father's Day, we're giving kids ways to celebrate their dads at the library. One fun, secretly-educational way to celebrate: our June take-home activity. Like our Mother's Day activity, it is a connect-the-dots/coloring/writing activity. The goal, besides being fun, is to reinforce some pre-reading skills: sequence, writing, holding a writing/coloring implement, expressing one's ideas in words, etc. Plus it makes for a nifty little card to give to Dad on Sunday!On the story side of things, my colleague is offering a whole Father's Day-themed preschool story time this week. And while I'm not sure of all the details of her program, I want to share one of my favorite books to celebrate Dad. My Dad, My Hero by Ethan Long is a brightly-illustrated picture book, narrated by a young boy, that enumerates the many ways in which his dad is decidedly NOT a superhero. He can't leap over buildings (blocks, of course), or open the tightest pickle jar lid--as demonstrated both by the text and, hilariously, by the illustrations. Despite Dad's lack of superhero powers, though, the boy concludes that his dad is still his hero. This book really touches on a feeling that is true for so many children: Dad is awesome and heroic.How will you be helping kids celebrate dads at the library this week?"},

It's looking like this may be a blockbuster summer--tons of kids and teens signing up for and participating in the reading programs, lots of half-full displays from so many books circulating, and high demand for our variety of programs. I've been able to observe the enthusiastic chaos and interact with excited kids for one primary reason: I have great volunteers handling the bulk of the summer reading program workload.The children's side of oursummer reading station.I'm happy to say that the first week of summer reading sign-ups (and, toward the end of the week, prize distribution) went very well overall. As each volunteer arrived for his or her shift, I gave a \"tour\" of our mobile summer reading station--during volunteer-staffed hours, it has its own location and table in the library, and during non-volunteer hours it gets wheeled behind the reference desk. I made the tour a bit of a training refresher, and I noticed that many of the volunteers already felt comfortable with the program even before their first shifts. That May training really paid off!I tried to make sure the volunteers had everything they could possibly need at the summer reading station: book logs, stickers to give to kids who signed up, prizes, program calendars, bookmarks, a stamp to mark when prizes are given... Does your summer reading station at your library have this much stuff, too? I felt like I was surrounding my volunteers with a mountain of Dream Big READ and Own the Night paraphernalia. They proved, though, that they were more than up to the challenge.Despite the volunteers' level of knowledge and confidence, I made sure to emphasize that the reference desk was only ten feet away should they need anything or have questions. Knowing they weren't totally on their own helped put many first-time volunteers at ease. After the first fifteen minutes of each shift, though, I witnessed all of the volunteers settling into their roles and getting kids excited about the program. It was a beautiful sight.I did make a few adaptations to my method and to the summer reading station as the week progressed, and I'm making notes to utilize the following tools next summer:I printed out a slideshow handout cheat sheet explaining the core stages of the program (registration, halfway prize, completion prize), including a breakdown describing the exact items a participant of each program should get at each stage. I put these cheat sheets in some magnetic sign holders in front of each volunteer's chair. They all mentioned how helpful they found this sheet.I hung around the summer reading station for the first few customer interactions of each volunteer's shift. That way I could coach and correct them as necessary, and I was able to point out any aspects of the program that I may have forgotten to mention earlier. (There's something about repeating the same information forty-five million times that makes me miss a small but important fact every once in a while...)I encouraged volunteers to immediately sign themselves and their siblings up for the program. Turns out there's nothing quite as motivating as making sure you know how to earn your own prizes!I'll be interested to see how things continue to develop as the high numbers of registrations turn into high numbers of kids collecting their prizes. I anticipate that these future interactions will involve less explanation on the part of the volunteers, but more time will go into making sure the correct prizes are given, encouraging continued reading, etc. I think my volunteers are ready!The first week's stats:Total program registrations (children and teens): 897Total volunteer hours worked: 51Number of volunteers helping with summer reading: 27"},
{"title": null, "date": "Wednesday, June 6, 2012", "text": "I'm making good progress in getting through the rest of the Mark Twain Readers Award nominees. After this batch, I only have two more left to read.Palace Beautiful by Sarah DeFord Williams is a thoughtful historical fiction novel about Sadie and her sister, father, and step-father as they move from Houston to Salt Lake City. Set in 1985, the story documents Sadie's befriending the neighbor girl and discovering a secret attic room in her new house. Together with her younger sister Zuzu and her neighbor Bella, Sadie discovers the journal of one of the houses WWI-era residents. The girls make a pact to read the journal together a few entries at a time, and as the story of the journal's owner develops, they start to sense impending trouble in the writer's life. The journal writer's struggles mirror some of Sadie's own fears about her life, and she becomes comfortable in her new surroundings as the girls seek to find the journal's owner. This story is somewhat gentle and richly historical, and many young readers--girls in particular--will delight in the descriptions of life in WWI and the lovely friendship story between Sadie and Bella.Hide & Seek by Katy Grant follows middle schooler Chase, an avid Arizona biker and hiker, as he encounters an interesting message while out geocaching. On his first solo geocaching adventure, Chase notices a strange message in the geocache's log: \"HELP WE NE.\" Intrigued, Chase returns several days in a row, and he learns that the message has come from two young boys. Despite how much he enjoys spending time out in nature with these two youngsters, Chase starts to worry that they might be in some sort of trouble. What results is a captivating story, part adventure and part heartfelt, as Chase struggles to help his new friends while also keeping himself safe in the Arizona desert. This book will be a great read for sports-minded readers, young boys in particular.Out of My Mind by Sharon M. Draper is narrated by eleven-year-old Melody, who has never spoken a word as a result of her cerebral palsy. Confined to a wheelchair and dependent on caretakers and family, Melody is bored out of her mind--everyone assumes that since she cannot communicate she is also mentally impaired. On the contrary, Melody is incredibly bright. When she finally finds a way to communicate with the people around her, Melody has lots to say. Despite her ability to assert her intelligence and unique personality, Melody struggles with her fellow fifth graders, not all of whom seem willing to accept her as a regular elementary school girl. Out of My Mind is a wonderful, wonderful story documenting just how frustrating Melody can find her life--and how, when push comes to shove, her frustrations, challenges, and fears aren't really that different from those of any other child. I'll be highly recommending this novel to readers who enjoy realistic fiction and school stories, and I'll be booktalking it along with Lord's Rules and Erskine's Mockingbird."},
{"title": null, "date": "Monday, June 4, 2012", "text": "In my library, we strive to offer programs for children at every age. My entire department shares responsibility for the requisite school-age programs and preschool story times, and one of my staff offers regular two-year-old story times as well. That just leaves the littlest library-goers: babies and toddlers. Happily, the job of offering a twice-monthly babies and toddlers story time falls to me.In creating a program plan for my Bouncing Babies program, which serves children 1 month through 23 months and their caregivers, I try to keep a few key ideas in mind. First, it's never too early to start developing crucial pre-reading skills (ECRR--need I say more?). Second, I believe it is also never too early to start forming positive associations with the library. I strive for all of the little ones to have a good time so that the library becomes a comfortable, loved place. And lastly, I believe that the grown-up caregivers of children under age two can sometimes feel starved for a bit of interaction with other grown-ups. My programs should be an opportunity for them to destress, too.With all of those points in mind, I have created the following program format for my Bouncing Babies programs. The program lasts about 30 minutes plus some time for free play, and I don't deviate from that format very much--really, the fundamental components stay the same from week to week, which allows for a sense of routine that is comfortable to both babies and grown-ups.(A few things to keep in mind: I print out a sheet with all of the songs and rhymes and pass it out as folks arrive; that way no one feels unable to sing along if they want to. Also, I start every session by mentioning that the door to the program room, while closed, is unlocked, so if anyone starts to have a meltdown, child and caregiver can step out for a few minutes and return when calmed down. I also stress that it's okay if a child doesn't want to stay by Mom but instead wants to run around--different learning styles and all. Finally, I pepper the program with little child development factoids about the importance of animal sounds, why nursery rhymes are so important, why \"practicing\" holding books is a good story time activity, etc. Parents have said they really appreciate learning these little bits of information, and it helps them realize why continuing early literacy activities at home is so important.)Enough of the background. Here's what I do:Bouncing BabiesSongs and Rhymes     I start every session with a welcome song that I most definitely copied from the library at which I interned in grad school: \"Hello, Everybody, and How Are You?\". The song, below, provides a definitive sense of the story time starting, and it usually goes on long enough to allow for any stragglers to make their way into the program room before things really get going. Also, in repeating the song for each child, the little ones get to hear their names--one of the first sounds they really tune in to. It's like magic for calming down even the crankiest of toddlers.Hello, Everybody, and How Are You?Hello, everybody*, and how are you?How are you? How are you?Hello, everybody*, and how are you?How are you today?*repeat with each child's name     I always emphasize that bouncing and clapping along to the rhythm of the opening song, as well as the rest of the songs and rhymes, is really beneficial to babies and toddlers. Not only is the movement fun, but it starts to introduce little ones to the idea of rhythm--a fundamental component of language and reading.     We spend the next ten-ish minutes as a group singing the songs and saying the rhymes on the handout. These include nursery rhymes (Hey, Diddle Diddle), traditional children's songs (Baa, Baa, Black Sheep), and bounce and tickle rhymes (Round About, Round About). I repeat each one at least twice, as the first time around is usually a demonstration and folks don't always chime in until the second time. Admittedly, sometimes the mood of the group prohibits us from getting through all the rhymes. That's another reason I make the handout, though--caregivers can take it home and do the rhymes there.     Suggested resources: Baby Rhyming Time, John Feierabend's First Steps in Music series, and the storytimes notes on the ALSC website.Books     I always share a short, easy-to-see book with the group--it's a great way to start modeling story time behavior for future story time participants. I choose books that have fun interactive components, peek-a-boo flaps in particular. Since these books inevitably fall apart when they are circulated, it's a treat to enjoy these books in a program. All of my copies are staff copies for the program only, so they stay in good condition. Some of my favorites: Peek-a-Moo!; Good Morning, Toucan; anything Spot; and Moo Baa La La La.     Next comes time for booksharing between child and caregiver. I have a basket full of fun, age-appropriate board books that are wonderful for exploring how books work. Again, none of these resources is used for anything except my Bouncing Babies programs. Since I control their use, I'm able to include some great interactive books. Think Usborne Touchy-Feeling Books, Dwell Studio's great Touch and Feel or Circle books, any anything else with manipulable elements. Oh, and I also include lots of Sandra Boynton because they're just so much fun!Music     After we put away our books, I break out our hand bells. I was able to purchase some baby-safe musical bells with a grant from our Friends of the Library, and they've been a hit ever since. Despite my initial worry that the noise of the collective bells ringing would be too much for some babies, EVERYONE loves this part of the program. Depending on the mood of the group, we'll sometimes have a little parade, shaking our bells along to some classical music. Other times we stay where we are and try ringing our bells high, low, fast, and slow. Lots of investigation into how bells work happens at this point.PlayBooks, Bells, and Tactile Balls!     Play is so important to the development of little ones, and I would consider myself horribly remiss if I didn't include time to play into our program schedule. Right now I offer two Bouncing Babies programs per month, and I alternate toys from session to session. Some weeks I break out some foam building blocks--plenty for everyone to play and build. Other weeks I dump out my box of tactile balls--some with ridges, some with bumps, some with holes, etc. From this point on, the rest of the program is free play. Little ones are free to explore and experiment with the toys available to them, and it is wonderful to see them figure out how to manipulate what they've got in their hands. It's important to me that all the toys be different bright colors--that way the almost-twos in the program can get a bit of color reinforcement out of playtime while their younger counterparts are chewing on whatever they've got. Everyone's happy! (I always emphasize to caregivers that the toys are cleaned after each program, so exploring with one's mouth is okay by me--after all, it's developmentally appropriate!)That's what I do at my Bouncing Babies programs. Attendance has steadily risen since I started at my library last August, and at this point I offer two sessions each program day--10 a.m. and 11 a.m.--in order to accommodate all the families who want to attend. What better confirmation of a good program is there than a room packed with happy parents and giggling babies?"},
{"title": null, "date": "Saturday, June 2, 2012", "text": "I've been making progress toward my goal of reading all of the 2012-2013 Mark Twain Readers Award nominees. Here are the synopses and recommendations of the last three I've finished:Drizzle by Kathleen Van Cleve is the story of Polly Peabody, who lives on her family's magical rhubarb farm. You don't think rhubarb farming can be magical? Well, it is on this farm, which grows giant rhubarb and chocolate rhubarb, and where it rains every Monday at exactly 1 p.m. despite the farm's location in a drought-prone area of the country. Things start to seem much less perfect and magical, though, when Polly's beloved aunt decides she wants to sell the farm despite the protests of Polly and her family. When her aunt leaves town, that much-needed rain suddenly stops--and all sorts of chaos breaks out. Polly must determine if she's the sort of girl who can reverse the bad luck while her family and their livelihood seem to be headed for total disaster. This fanciful yet heartfelt story deals with such ubiquitous topics as bullying, feeling afraid, the trials of friendship, and the difficulty in living up to your potential. I'll be recommending this book for some of my more self-conscious readers who may need a bit of literary encouragement to come out of their shells.Ghost Dog Secrets by Peg Kehret is a lovely story about doing the right thing and fighting for the underdog--literally. When Rusty sees a dog chained to a tree day after day without food, water, or shelter, he and his best friend decide to try to help. Their class at school has been focusing on addressing problems in their community, and Rusty takes this message to heart as he \"rescues\" the dog, who he names Ra. It turns out Ra's owner very much wants his dog back--and he's willing to intimidate and threaten Rusty in the process. To make matters even more interesting, Rusty can see a ghost collie who seems to want him to protect Ra at all costs. Ghost Dog Secrets mixes the realistic themes of a boy and his pet, school difficulties, family dynamics, and animal cruelty with some supernatural elements and a bit of thriller suspense that will hook almost any young reader.Half Upon a Time by James Riley is a fantastic fractured fairy tale. Jack has never been keen on his hero training--all the princesses are spoken for, so why risk his neck with adventure? When a princess literally falls from the sky, however, Jack finds himself engaged in a quest beyond anything he could have imagined. He and the princess, May, don't quite get along, but Jack is willing to put up with her, a slightly annoying prince, and a good deal of danger to help May find her kidnapped grandmother. Along the way we meet a giant, some dwarves, the Wolf King, and all manner of characters from fairy tales of old. There is plenty of adventure and humor in this tale to appeal to the average school-age reader, but the wonderful spin on fairy tale classics and some great fairy tale puns make this novel an above-average addition to the genre. I'll be recommending this title to readers looking for adventure, humor, and a bit of fun, and I'll probably read aloud from it at some summer programs, too."},
{"title": null, "date": "Wednesday, May 30, 2012", "text": "At my library, we're lucky enough to have a bunch of year-round teen volunteers who help get things done in the branch. They pull lists of books for displays and programs, withdraw materials, help with craft preparation, and complete a myriad other tasks as they come up--and often tasks do just seem to spring out of nowhere.In the summer, though, it's different. For the two months my library district offers its summer reading programs (SRPs), the number of teen volunteers at my library jumps from a dozen to over thirty. And for the duration of the programs, teen volunteers are focused almost entirely on the summer reading station at the branch. My library district simultaneously offers three SRPs for children (all on the same theme, but with slight modifications for age and reading ability), a program for teens, and a program for adults, all of which make for a potentially confusing summer. Thus the necessity of what every volunteer really needs to be effective: training.I hosted our summer reading volunteer training last week, and nearly all of the thirty volunteers attended (non-attendees are trained one-on-one when their schedules allow). I had pizza and drinks handy--they are teens, after all!--and after a bit of socializing, we got down to business.I spent a good twenty minutes going over the children's and teen SRPs with my volunteers; these are the programs they'll be promoting and explaining during all of their summer volunteer shifts. I made sure to have as many visuals as possible. Everyone got a cheat sheet of the programs and how they work, and a number of the volunteers took notes as I talked. I passed around the various book logs for the programs, and I showed the prizes that participants will earn for reading over the summer. I will be the first person to admit that explaining four SRPs can be really, really boring. With a bit of humor, space for questions, and flinging of prize glow-in-the-dark stars, though, we made it through with minimal fuss. They were even enthusiastic through the process of individually selecting their volunteer shifts, which took a while.What did the teen volunteers absolutely love about the training, though? Role playing. I gave them potential SRP scenarios: a frazzled mom approaches the summer reading station and wants to sign up her four kids; a teenager hovers near the table while trying to appear disinterested; a young child wants to sign up for the program and boasts that he'll finish by tomorrow and start over again to get tons of prizes; an older sibling wants to know if a pre-reader younger sibling can participate. Throughout all of these scenarios, my teens became more and more confident with the program information. Success, even if just for that first evening!Despite the volunteers' training and enthusiasm, however, I do fully expect to need to refresh my volunteers on the programs once they start their shifts next week. That won't be a problem, though; I'll likely need to refresh some library staff, too, what with all the different SRPs. That initial investment of time will be worth it, though: throughout the entire summer, our army of summer reading volunteers will take some of the SRP rush away from the reference desk, get kids and peers enthused about the programs and (most importantly!) reading, and develop a real sense of pride and in contributing to the library. I already know that, with nearly 60 summer reading volunteer hours each week, they will be making a HUGE difference in how well my library is able to operate during the busy summer months. A major goal, though, is for the volunteers themselves to feel ownership in their library.I'll check back in with the progress my summer reading volunteers make throughout the summer, as well as some of the areas for improvement next year. Sound off in the comments if you have tips, success stories, or (I hope not!) horror stories of using volunteers in your summer reading programs."},

As I make progress through my stack of novels, I'll post some synopses of the books as well as notes about what type of readers might enjoy them.Because of Mr. Terupt by Rob Buyea is everything that is wonderful about a school story. Mr. Terupt is the new fifth grade teacher, and the story is told from the varying perspectives and voices of several members of his class. There's Peter, the trouble-maker; Lexie, the mean girl; Jessica, the new girl; Luke, the academically-driven young boy; and a handful of other fifth graders with real voices, interesting backstories, and genuine fifth-grader problems. The story progresses through the months of the school year, beginning with everyone growing comfortable with Mr. Terupt's unique teaching style and leading up to an incident that shakes the students and shapes the rest of their fifth grade experience. So many young readers can identify with this book--there really is a character for every personality--and the frank yet tender portrayal of the difficulties in growing up makes it a stellar novel. I'll be recommending Because of Mr. Terupt to readers looking for realistic stories as well as those looking to connect with a book character.Belly Up by Stuart Gibbs has a remarkably unique premise: when push comes to shove, it's a mystery about a murder--of a hippo. Teddy Fitzroy lives at FunJungle, the world's largest and most impressive zoo, where his parents are an animal photographer and a highly respected gorilla researcher. FunJungle has only been open for a few weeks, and it would appear mayhem has already struck: Henry the Hippo, the park's not-so-friendly mascot, has been found dead. After a rather humorously-described autopsy, the head vet determines Henry has been murdered. Luckily Teddy was spying on the autopsy, because FunJungle appears to want to cover up the murder. Teddy takes it upon himself to solve the mystery, but not without some zoo-specific dangers to his own life along the way. Teddy is a great narrator, and it is really enjoyable to tag along throughout his animal investigations. There is also plenty of gross-out humor in the novel, perfect for young male readers, that keeps the book light-hearted. I'll be recommending Belly Up to reluctant readers, especially boys, as well as readers with interests in animals."},

{"title": null, "date": "Wednesday, May 23, 2012", "text": "I've gone back and forth on the themes-in-story-time debate this spring. I've done a handful of story times with themes, but I've also done a few programs using just new books or my favorites. All of the programs went over well, which indicates to me that the issue of themed story times is more a librarian's preference than a best-practices discussion. Regardless of what your preferences are in terms of using themes in your story times, however, I think we can all agree on one thing: kids love stories about animals.I put together the following animal-themed story time for an evening program that draws a younger (~2) crowd and a mom's group with mostly 2-year-olds. It went over well, what with the variety of interactive elements in the books and the enjoyment my audiences got from sharing animal noises throughout. I'll be adapting this animal story time for the summer, adding in a few books for older listeners and trimming out the craft component as I take this program to outreach locations.What are your favorite animal-themed books, songs, and fingerplays?Opening Song: \"Open, Shut Them\"Story: The Doghouse by Jan Thomas     Mouse, Cow, Pig, and Duck are playing a friendly game of toss-the-ball when their ball rolls into the doghouse. Oh no! Mouse makes a big deal of who he sends into the doghouse after the ball, emphasizing each of his friends' brave qualities as they timidly head into the doghouse. One by one they enter, and to Mouse's alarm they do not come out! When Dog steps outside to let Mouse know he's having Duck for dinner, Mouse panics. But, in true Jan Thomas fashion, it could all just be a funny misunderstanding... Kids of all ages enjoy getting in on the joke in this book, and they are captivated by the fact that Thomas's narrative illustrations begin immediately on the inside cover.Story: Dancing Feet! by Lindsay Craig     This great story with simple, repetitive text and guesses at animal recognition on the page turns has proven to be a big hit with all sizes of audiences. With the smaller groups, we get up and dance the different beats of the animals (the ladybug dances a tippity beat, the elephant a stompity one, etc.), and we end up in a sort of crazy animal dancing parade. With larger groups, we experiment with using our hands to make the different dancing noises--fingertips for the ladybug, flat palms on thighs for the elephant, and so on. The interactive options for this book are many, and the simple text itself is rhythmic and wonderful. We all know how important rhythm is in developing pre-reading skills!Song and Dance Break: \"Willoughby Wallaby Woo\" on Singable Songs for the Very Young by Raffi     While Raffi is singing this classic, silly children's song from our boombox, our group takes turns having Horton, our stuffed elephant, sit on everyone's heads. I usually start off with Horton on my head before setting him on a child's, and then within a few seconds--possibly with some parental encouragement--everyone gets the hang of the activity. Mom! There's an elephant on your head! Now it's on my head! How silly! I've found the song is generally long enough to get Horton on the head of every attendee--you wouldn't want any kids to miss out on a one-of-a-kind elephant hat, now would you?Story: Moo, Moo, Brown Cow! Have You Any Milk? by Phillis Gershator     I must say, I love this relatively new book. Using the format of \"Baa, baa, black sheep,\" the book takes readers through a colorful, calming exploration of many farm animals as they prepare for bedtime. As we meet each animal, we get a plethora of child-friendly information about it: its name, what sound it makes, what color it is, what it produces, and what we make from that product. Example: \"Baa, baa, black sheep, have you any wool? / 'Yes, sir, yes, sir, three bags full.' / Does wool make a blanket for my bed? / 'Yes, sir, yes, sir,' the black sheep said.\" We meet a grey goose with down feathers for our pillows, a brown cow with milk for a bedtime drink, and other animals, too. It might seem like there's a lot going on in this story, what with the animal recognition, animal noises, colors, and more, but the repetitive rhyming text and clear, lovely illustrations make the whole book very accessible to even young children. I highly recommend it.Fingerplay: \"Five Little Ducks\"     Anywhere I go, whatever story time group I'm addressing, everyone is familiar with \"Five Little Ducks.\" Because it's a familiar fingerplay and song, everyone is always excited to sing and mime along with me as the little ducks go wandering over the hill and far away. Kids get really into the counting element of the song, too, and they work those fine motor skills to hold up the proper number of fingers each round. Librarian gold, this fingerplay is.Craft: Duck Puppets     I use duck stick puppets to accompany the \"Five Little Ducks\" fingerplay, so why not encourage kids to do the same at home with their very own puppets? I try to keep this craft as simple as possible, using just a handful of supplies: ducks die-cut on yellow cardstock, fat popsicle sticks, glue dots for putting the puppets together, and crayons for decorating the puppets. And never fear, those of you who like a craft to take at least ten minutes--while assembly is quick, decorating five little ducks can take a while!Other books I had on hand in case they were needed:Ten in the Bed by Jane CabreraFive Little Monkeys Jumping on the Bed by Eileen ChristelowPete the Cat: I Love My White Shoes by Eric Litwin"},
{"title": null, "date": "Monday, May 21, 2012", "text": "Theodore Boone: Kid Lawyer is the first book in a legal thriller series for young readers by John Grisham. You know all of those slightly argumentative (in a good way!) older elementary school kids who seem always ready to pick an arbitrary fight over books, movies, anything? Consider getting those kids started on this series.Theo Boone is the only child of two lawyers, and the way he tells it, he had no choice but to become steeped in law and justice as well. When a murder trial is set to take place in his town, Theo uses his familiarity with the judges and courts to get his government class seats at the opening arguments of the trial. Theo's desire to follow every detail of the trial becomes somewhat complicated, though, when a friend confides he might know something about the case--something big. Suddenly Theo is torn between keeping his friend's confidence and seeing justice prevail.Theodore Boone: Kid Lawyer could have easily spiraled into a boring, dumbed-down legal story, but I'm glad to say that is decidedly not the case. The thriller is exciting and captivating enough to keep almost any reader's attention, yet it is not so sensational as to turn away fans of realistic fiction or sensitive readers. I love the narration style, too; everything is told from Theo's perspective, and that means we're privy to all Theo's snarky thoughts while he presents an outward reserved politeness. What kid can't relate to having to agree politely with a grown-up when he'd rather tell said grown-up off? Theo Boone may be acting like a young lawyer, but he is very relatable.I listened to the audiobook version of Theodore Boone: Kid Lawyer, which is read superbly by Richard Thomas. The pacing is perfect to build suspense and develop Theo's character, and Thomas does enough voice variation to keep the plot moving along quickly without generating confusion. The five-hour audiobook makes for great listening on an otherwise uneventful car ride, perfect for summer travels.Theodore Boone: Kid Lawyer is nominated for Missouri's Mark Twain Readers Award for the 2012-2013 school year. The award recognizes books for readers in grades 4 through 6."},
{"title": null, "date": "Saturday, May 19, 2012", "text": "I'm always looking for ways to put a new spin on story time. I'm interested in adding in music, science activities, play... all sorts of things to promote literacy, a love of books, and a love of the library. I've read and heard about stuffed animal sleepovers at the library several times over the past year. Boy am I glad I gave this program a try!Bedtime at the library sleepover!The concept is straightforward: kids drop off stuffed animals at the library in the evening, and those stuffed animals spend the night at the library doing all sorts of fun things. The stuffed animals are then waiting for their respective owners at a story time the next morning, where the night's activities are recounted. I was a little nervous about marketing this program--would the description be enough to get the two-part event across? I ended up e-mailing registered participants the day before the drop-off to reiterate how the program would work, and happily there was no confusion as to the logistics of the program. I was also somewhat surprised by the number of families who registered for and participated in this first-time program: 18 kids brought stuffed animals to the library and picked them up the next day, a high number for a preschool story time outside of our regular weekly morning program.Little Green Man and Turtleexplored some picture books.The most satisfying aspect of putting on this stuffed animal sleepover story time was the excited feedback of the kids who participated and their caregivers. When the kids dropped off their stuffed animals, they were very adult about the transaction, responsibly informing me of any special needs on the part of their stuffed friends. When they picked up their stuffed animals the next day and saw what they'd been up to all night at the library, they had some tremendous looks of magic in their eyes: Look what wonderful things my friend got to do at the library! Caregivers, too, said they were impressed with the program--a few families even came from a few towns over to participate.When all was said and done, this story time event didn't take much more planning or work than any other story time. Even if it had taken more time than other programs, it would be well worth repeating. Here's what I did:The Night BeforeThe Drop-Off     Families were encouraged to bring their preschoolers to drop off their stuffed animal friends between 5 and 8:30 in the evening, which coincided with my shift of the reference desk. I had prepared blank nametags before the drop-off, and as each child introduced me to his or her friend, I made a nametag for the stuffed animal. I also made a point of asking if the stuffed friend had anything special he or she needed before bedtime. A lot of kids said to make sure friends had a drink of water, heard a bedtime story, and got tucked in. I made notes of these details, and every child walked away from the drop-off feeling confident that all of the stuffed animals would be in good hands.Harry the Bear read Where the WildThings Are before bedtime.The Sleepover     This bit of the program is, admittedly, a bit frantic if you're keen on finishing it before the library closes. I rushed around the library taking photos of all the sleepover activities the stuffed animals participated in: book cart races, playing at the train table, taking turns playing computer games, playing hide and seek in the stacks... I made sure to get photos of every stuffed animal at least twice, and I made sure the pictures included the activities the kids had mentioned as important to bedtime rituals. I then put all of the photos I had taken of the sleepover into a slideshow with some captions, which would serve to recap the sleepover portion of event at the story time.Story Time     I had set all of the stuffed animals out in a circle in our story time space before kids started arriving. As soon as I opened the program room door, kids rushed to see their stuffed animal friends and to \"chat\" about what they had been up to. Those greetings were priceless.Opening Song: \"Alive, Alert, Awake, Enthusiastic\"I'm alive, alert, awake, enthusiastic.I'm alive, alert, awake, enthusiastic.I'm alive, alert, awake,I'm awake, alert, alive,I'm alive, alert, awake, enthusiastic.[Actions:alive = touch kneesalert = touch waistawake = touch shouldersenthusiastic = jazz hands over head]     This song is a popular morning song at the summer camp where I worked, and it is a great morning alternative to \"Head, Shoulders, Knees, and Toes.\" It gets the blood pumping, and it introduces some fun new vocabulary, too. Add in the options to speed up or slow down and you've got a giggle-inducing opening number.Visual: Stuffed Animal Sleepover Photo Slideshow     I had the slideshow of sleepover photos cued up, and I took several minutes narrating the stuffed animals' fun night at the library. The best reactions from the audience came from the images of stuffed friends having a bear-led story time and, understandably, being cutely tucked into their sleeping spots.Story: Knuffle Bunny: A Cautionary Tale by Mo Willems     This wonderfully-illustrated story tells of a young girl and her trip to the laundromat, where she accidentally leaves her precious stuffed animal friend Knuffle Bunny. Children always connect to this story--it explores the fear they all have of losing track of their stuffed animal friends while simultaneously showing a happy reunion in the end. Grown-ups love seeing this story read aloud, too, because Willems portrays the young girl's parents perfectly. And, really, is anything Willems does ever disappointing? (No.)Story: Time to Sleep Sheep the Sheep! by Mo Willems     Willems has been doing a series of short picture books featuring what I call Animals the Animals--in this story's case, the main character is Sheep the Sheep. In Time to Sleep, Sheep the Sheep goes from friend to friend getting everyone ready for bed. They have a drink, they brush their teeth, they go potty (kids love the inclusion of this before-bed ritual, and the accompanying illustration is hilarious), and then finally they settle down to sleep. Everyone except Owl the Owl, that is--in true goofy Willems fashion, Owl the Owl remains wide-eyed and awake and asks his sleeping pals if anyone wants to play checkers.Song and Dance Break: Any song that would befit a stuffed animal parade     We had a parade to end the story portion of our story time and to move us over to the snack and craft tables. Kids grabbed their stuffed animals and paraded around the room, making a big show of lifting up their stuffed friends and dancing with them.Snack: Mini doughnuts and apple juice boxes     Those animals had been in the library all night. Of course they were hungry! I don't usually do any sort of food in my preschool story times, but this special event merited a sleepover breakfast-style snack of doughnuts and juice boxes. I cleared those snacks with the parents during the drop-off the night before, and no one needed a special food accommodation.Craft: Stuffed Animal Sleepover Scrapbooks     Before the library opened the morning of the story time, I printed off one of the sleepover photos featuring each of the stuffed animals onto a quarter sheet of cardstock. Using more cardstock and some yarn, I then made a little blank scrapbook, photo on the cover, of each stuffed animal's sleepover experience. Our craft was a great opportunity for writing (sometimes a hard ECRR skill to incorporate!), as the craft tables had crayons and stickers available for writing in the scrapbooks. I walked from child to child and encouraged them to write about their stuffed friends' favorite activities from the sleepover. The resulting scrapbooks were very creative, and the kids' descriptions of the writing in the books was impressively detailed. What a wonderful early literacy activity! Also, this craft allowed every child to leave the program with a memento of their stuffed animal's first sleepover. What a success!"},
{"title": null, "date": "Thursday, May 17, 2012", "text": "Make Magic! Do Good! is a book of poetry written and illustrated by Dallas Clayton. The short poems in the book run the gamut of subjects, from friendship and musicians to the \"happy birthday\" song and a moose. The prepub copy I read called Clayton's work similar to that of Dr. Seuss and Shel Silverstein; when you're likened to two greats in cheeky children's poetry, I expect some silly, witty, and well-structured poems.While Clayton's poems work, they are not as tightly edited as those of the best children's poets. There is a fair amount of slant rhyme, some awkward pacing, and lines with too many or too few syllables--but then, none of these admittedly picky issues detracts that much from the overall imagery of the poetry. The subjects of the poems are definitely goofy and sometimes even irreverent, always aspects that appeal to young readers, although the final lines don't always have as much punch as they could. That said, it's not like falling somewhere short of Dr. Seuss and Shel Silverstein is necessarily a bad thing. Those two operated at the tip-top of the children's poetry universe, and it takes a lot to reach their level.The variety and tone of poems in Make Magic! Do Good!, as well as the really cutesy and fun illustrations throughout, will likely make this book of poetry interesting to kids who enjoy silly poems. I'll be including it in poetry displays for sure.Make Magic! Do Good! will be released by Candlewick Press on November 13, 2012."},
{"title": null, "date": "Monday, May 14, 2012", "text": "I think I've mentioned that I make it a point to read as many new picture books that come into my library as I can. I make note of the titles that I think would make great read-aloud story time additions, and every so often I amass enough new hits to fill a story time. I enjoy knowing the kiddos will hear great stories even if there is no unifying theme to the program. This month at preschool outreach: a smorgasbord of bears, robots, and storytelling.Opening Song: \"Open, Shut Them\"Story: Goldilocks and the Three Bears by Amanda Askew     The folktale of Goldilocks and the Three Bears is a classic for a reason. It's got great repetitive and cumulative elements, fun anthropomorphic characters, and a young protagonist who gets herself into a bit of mischief--all features of stories that young kids love! I start off asking how many kids have heard this story before--at least two-thirds, usually--before briefly explaining what it means to be a classic. Despite knowing the story, kids sit rapt as I read this. They love hearing something familiar while engaging with new, beautiful pictures. This story also provides a segue for talking about the moral of a tale. I love that at least one kid always mentioned stranger danger at this point.Story: The Sniffles for Bear by Bonny Becker     This story is a funny, slightly longer tale about Bear, who is convinced his current illness will be the death of him, and Mouse, who comes to Bear's house to help him get well. Bear is a comically big malingerer, and Mouse cutely provokes him on multiple occasions. What shows through, though, is the strong friendship between the two creatures. Sure, Bear may over exaggerate his cold, but Mouse seems more than happy to put up with some drama to help his friend. The sentiment is returned when Mouse finds he has come down with the sniffles, too.Action Chant: \"Going on a Bear Hunt\"     This chant is a staple of many a day camp and preschool, and for good reason. First and foremost, it's fun--kids love doing the actions and imagining the thrills of the bear hunt. The appeal of this chant is greater, though, when one considers that it reinforces concepts of opposites, direction, chronology, spacial reasoning... Plus, nothing can go horribly wrong with a wiggly, slightly noisy story time interlude.Story: Boy + Bot by Ame Dyckman     Another lovely, simple friendship story. Boy and Bot, a robot, meet one day and become friends. While playing together, Bot's power switch gets flipped to \"off.\" Boy doesn't know about Bot's power, so he assumes Bot has taken ill. Like a good friend, he takes Bot home to nurse him back to health. During the night, however, Bot is turned back on and mistakes Boy's sleep for malfunction. Bot then takes Boy to his inventor's house, where he tries to replace his battery (kids love this bit of goofiness--boys don't need batteries!). The illustrations in this shorter, straightforward picture book fit perfectly with its sincerity and minimalism. I'm going to be using this story again, and not just because it allows me an excuse to use my robot voice.Story: Silly Goose's Big Story by Keiko Kasza     Goose is a great storyteller, and he and his friends act out his stories for play. Goose's friends become frustrated, however, when Goose insists on always being the hero. When Goose is caught by a wolf intent on having him for a snack, Goose must tell the biggest story of his life. He creates a story about Wem, short for \"Wolf Eating Monster,\" in hopes of frightening Wolf into leaving him alone. When a scary Wem-like creature approaches, Wolf does leave Goose and run away. It turns out \"Wem\" is really the team of Goose's friends, working together to save Goose. Goose thanks them for being heroes instead of just playing heroes, and he begins a story about a silly goose with wonderful friends. I suppose my story time theme could almost have been \"friendship\"--this story is another great illustration of friends being there for one another.Closing Song: \"If You're Happy and You Know It\"Other books I had on hand in case they were needed:Where the Wild Things Are by Maurice SendakClink by Kelly DiPucchioBorn to Read by Judy Sierra"},
{"title": null, "date": "Wednesday, May 9, 2012", "text": "My library will be closed this Sunday for Mother's Day, but that doesn't mean we've been skimping on the mom-centered activities this week while the library is open! We've been making an attempt to hit all of our children's populations: in-house preschool story times, outreach story times, school-age craft programs, and take-home activities are several of the areas in which we've been encouraging kids to celebrate their moms.A great Mother's Day book I've been sharing during story times is Vivian French's picture book A Present for Mom. In the story, young Stanley has a hard time coming up with a Mother's Day gift on par with his siblings' bouquet of flowers, box of candy, and homemade cake. After all his initial ideas fail, he finally figures out the perfect gift: a box full of kisses! What mom wouldn't want a box full of kisses from her little one? This is a great story with tremendous versatility in terms of audience, telling, and programming. It works well as a read-aloud, but it would also translate well to a felt story. If you're inclined to include a craft with your story time, you can have kids decorate a box that they will fill with kisses for their own moms. Simple and meaningful!To engage young kids who come to the library but who don't necessarily come to programs, my library's May take-home activity is focused on Mother's Day. Kids have the opportunity to connect the dots to complete the flower, color the flower however they like, and write what they love about their moms on the lines. I'm big on early literacy activities, and this one works on multiple levels. The connect-the-dots exercise reinforces order and going from start to finish; the coloring gives an opportunity for asking questions about why a child colored the flower a certain way; and the writing activity encourages both the mechanics of writing (holding the writing implement) and the process (deciding what to say and how to say it). A celebration of mom and an early literacy exercise, all on one page.We didn't forget our school-age program-goers when planning our Mother's Day fun. Last week we had a \"Make Your Own Paper Bouquet\" program, where kids from kindergarten through the fifth grade created a variety of tissue paper flowers to arrange into their own bouquets. You can find all sorts of tissue paper flower craft instructions online (note: some are simpler than others!), and after a short step-by-step explanation of how each flower is constructed, most kids are content to get to work on their own. There were some gorgeous bouquets leaving my library that evening!How is your library celebrating moms this Mother's Day?"},
{"title": null, "date": "Sunday, May 6, 2012", "text": "It should come as no surprise to library folks who work with children that kids enjoy all sorts of activities that extend the books they love. Whether they get to search the library for Dr. Suess hats, take home a Curious George bookmark, play on the Thomas train table, or draw a picture inspired by a favorite book, kids LOVE to interact with their favorite stories in new ways. It can be tons of fun to bring favorite book characters into the library--think costumed Max and Ruby or Clifford--and these programs usually draw tons of young book enthusiasts. But what about bringing in the creative forces behind these favorite books? Yep, I'm talking about author visits.Me (as Lucy Bear)and Peter BrownAfter only one month at my current library, I was fortunate to be able to put on an author visit program with Peter Brown, author/illustrator of Children Make Terrible Pets fame (as well as a handful of other terrific, kid-loved books). Brown's book are aimed at preschoolers, and you might wonder, How engaged are preschoolers going to be in a program where a guy is talking to them about books? I am happy to say that even very young readers find exploring the behind-the-scenes workings of books fascinating. Brown put on a great program for my library--he talked about how he got started drawing books when he was a kid not much older than his audience, and he shared some great early artwork to illustrate his points. He was funny, he was aware of the attention span of his audience, and he patiently answered questions from kids about his own artwork and about theirs. Brown drew us a picture before the presentation ended, and as the kids got the chance to approach him and have their books signed, it was clear that they considered him a new friend. What had previously been just a good book to read was suddenly so much more personal and nuanced. I know the guy who made that book! He's funny! I can start to make books, too!This weekend I attended a similar author event at another library in my district. Ashley Wolff, illustrator and author of a whole slew of books including the well-love Miss Bindergarten series, really engaged her young audience with examples of her early artwork and her simple explanations of how she uses the people she knows--family, friends--as models for her characters. She asked how many kids consider themselves good artists (every hand shot up!), and she talked about the passion, practice, patience, and perseverance that go into becoming an even better artist. Wolff talked for a nice chunk of time, but not once did those kids get fidgety or bored. Kids love seeing how their favorite stories come to be. And perhaps more than anything else, they love the feeling of personal connection to books that is a result of a good author program. I won't be the least bit surprised if the kids from my library who attended will be bringing me their own book illustrations in the next week or two. A good author visit is that exciting and inspiring.What about at your library? Have you embraced author visits? How have they gone, and how were they received by your kids?"},
{"title": null, "date": "Wednesday, May 2, 2012", "text": "The Wednesdays, written by Julie Bourbeau with illustrations from Jason Beene, tells the story of Max, whose village is completely normal--except on Wednesdays. Every week when Wednesday rolls around, all the village residents close their shops, lock their doors and windows, and stay inside all day. Those who don't, those few who venture into the Wednesday madness, experience odd little mischiefs like having their pants pulled down, tripping over seemingly nothing, and finding all manner of devices and machines don't work as they should. Wednesdays, frankly, are weird.When Max ventures out one Wednesday, however, he goes in search of the creatures that wreak so much havoc--called, easily enough, wednesdays. He finds them, and while at first he finds their pranks harmless and funny, he begins to see a crueler side of many of the older wednesdays. When he starts to turn into one of them, he worries. Could he be destined for a life of spreading mean mischief in his village once a week? It's up to Max and a few of his friends to navigate the paranormal happenings in their town and to save Max from permanently becoming a wednesday.The Wednesdays has a premise that many young readers will find interesting, and the confusion and suspense get more weight as we follow along with Max as he experiences his change toward one of the wednesday creatures. The book has some funny characters and funny passages, but it gets sneakily moralistic, too; as Max ponders the merits of mischief for mischief's sake, he starts to consider just how much one person's actions can influence others. The story is strange, sure, but it is solid, moves at a quick, thrilling pace, and boasts strong young characters. I will recommend this book to young readers, in particular male readers, with a penchant for odd stories or who are looking to relate to a character who feels a bit different from everyone else.The Wednesdays will be released by Alfred A. Knopf Books for Young Readers on August 14, 2012."},
{"title": null, "date": "Tuesday, April 24, 2012", "text": "My April Evening Family Story Time program focused on an Earth Day-friendly theme: exploring your own backyard. This monthly evening story time is still a relatively new program for my library, so the attendance isn't consistent yet and I'm never quite sure what ages of kids will show up. I've found that I always over-prepare materials--having plenty of stories and songs that can run the gamut of ages--and that strategy has so far proved successful. It always helps, too, to have a theme that will appeal to a variety of ages. And what kids don't want to explore the nature around them?Opening Song: \"Open, Shut Them\"Story: A Walk in the Park by Jo Waters     This is a great, simple text with clear photographs of the different sorts of creatures most anyone will find in their yard, local park, etc. Kids of all ages enjoy discovering the myriad of animals--geese, worms, ladybugs--that are often very close by when they're outside. My library has this book catalogued in picture books, but it could easily pass for early non-fiction.Song: \"Grey Squirrel\"     This song is a classic for a reason. It's simple, quick, interactive, and great for pretty much any age group.Grey SquirrelGrey squirrel, grey squirrel,Swish your bushy tail.﻿Grey squirrel, grey squirrel,Swish your bushy tail.﻿Crinkle up your funny nose,Put a nut between your toes.Grey squirrel, grey squirrel,Swish your bushy tail.﻿﻿Story: Tweedle Dee Dee by Charlotte Voake     This picture book is a classic example of the cumulative story. This lyrical book explores a single tree with green leaves all around it: the birds in the nest on the branch on the tree in the hole in the ground... When I used this story, kids really enjoyed chiming in as they remembered what came next in the text. The book has lovely illustrations, too.Song/Dance Break: \"The Green Grass Grew All Around\" from Phil Rosenthal and Family's The Green Grass Grew All Around: Family Folk Songs     This song is a children's and camp classic. I like to do some motions to go along with it: standing rigid for the tree, sticking out an arm for the branch, cupping my hands for the nest, and so on. As the song goes on, it gets more and more confusing--in a fun way!--as everyone tries to remember the order of the motions. Also lots of fun: everyone gets the chance to spin around at the end, as the green grass grows all around.Story: Birds by Kevin Henkes     Birds was nominated for a Missouri Building Block Picture Book Award this past year, and every outreach group I read it to really engaged with the simple premise. Author/illustrator Henkes delves into everything about birds; I have found that young kids appreciate this intense focus on one subject. We look at different colors of birds, different sizes of birds, different bird behaviors... Kids really get into all of the bird information, and they enjoy the simple, beautiful artwork that accompanies the minimal text.Story: The Busy Tree by Jennifer Ward     Who knew just how bustling with life your average tree is? This book explores all of the animals who live in and interact with a single tree: owls, squirrels, birds, chipmunks, and more. The story is a great vocabulary refresher for lots of animals that even younger kids have come to know, and it has a distinctive nature explorer feel to it. Ending my story time with this book definitely allowed us to conclude with a desire to explore the busy-ness of the nature around us.Craft: Binoculars     What better way to be a nature explorer than to use your very own hand-crafted binoculars for spying animals and the like? Prior to the program, I had glued toilet paper tubes together to form the binoculars, and I had also tied string to each pair so they could be worn around kids' necks. Our actual crafting after the story time consisted of decorating our binoculars. I had stickers and markers available to satisfy a variety of creative urges, and several kids walked out of the library that evening with their eyes peering through their brightly-decorated binoculars.Other books I had on hand in case they were needed:The Growing-Up Tree by Vera RosenberryA Grand Old Tree by Mary Newell DePalmaThe Curious Garden by Peter Brown"},
{"title": null, "date": "Saturday, April 21, 2012", "text": "Superheroes are big at the library. A few times a week, I find myself having superhero conversations with kids who come in looking for a book or, sometimes, just someone with whom to share a recent superhero story. (Thanks to my friend Mike for always making sure I'm up to date on the latest superhero news!) I order lots of superhero books, and my branch has a permanent display of all our titles for easy access and browsing. Wonder Woman? Got it! Batman? Got it! Green Hornet? You bet! Spider-Man? Yep. We even get an assortment of monthly comic books.Moral of that story: my library is superhero friendly for kids. I was recently intrigued, though, by the arrival of The Might Avengers: An Origin Story, a children's picture book adapted by Rich Thomas and illustrated by Pat Olliffe and Hi-Fi Design. In my mind, the publication of this picture book is tied to the upcoming film release of The Avengers movie. The book tells the story of how the Avengers came to be a team of evil-fighting superheroes, and it includes great illustrations alongside a brief, clearly-worded story. I think young superhero fans will really like this book, especially those who have older siblings also into superheroes or those who have been seeing Avengers previews.My one point of hesitation is this: if this book is a tie-in with The Avengers film, what do we make of the fact that the picture book is for a young audience while the movie is rated PG-13? As I mentioned, I think the book stands on its own really well, so the book adds quality to our collection in and of itself. As a public librarian, however, I have to anticipate some sort of conflict, even if just with one young customer, will result from being able to access the book but not the movie. Any other librarians anticipating this sort of situation?"},
{"title": null, "date": "Tuesday, April 17, 2012", "text": "My Under the Sea themed jewelryI have a document at my library that consists solely of lists of books I'd like to one day use in story time programs. Every time I find a book that I think would be fun to share--whether it's by perusing the new books, browsing the shelves, or hearing customer recommendations--I add it to my list, and occasionally I'll go through the document and group stories loosely by themes. This document is a lifesaver when it comes to quickly planning preschool and outreach story times, and it's where I assembled most of the Under the Sea story time I'm currently taking to area preschools. Dive in!Opening Song: \"Open, Shut Them\"Story: I'm a Shark by Bob Shea     Bob Shea writes great picture books. His characters are hilarious with big personalities, and kids always relate to them. The illustrations are clear and bright, which bodes well for large story time audiences. The conversational text of many of his books, too, makes for a really great opening or closing to a program. This book focuses on Shark, who professes he is not afraid of anything. Yet somehow his professions of toughness keep revolving around the presence of spiders... This is a great, amusing story.Song: \"Baby Shark\"     I always start songs and fingerplays like this one by asking the kiddos to get out their sharks (or fish, or whatever else the song/rhyme calls for). They always giggle--of course they didn't bring sharks to school!--before shaping their hands to the shark shape. We go through the variety of sizes and shapes of the shark family in this song as kids get their wiggles out.Baby SharkBaby shark doo doo, doo doo (repeat 2 times)﻿make a shark with the thumb and pointer fingerMama shark doo doo, doo doo (repeat 2 times)﻿use the thumb and rest of the handDaddy shark doo doo, doo doo (repeat 2 times)﻿use two handsGrandpa shark doo doo, doo doo (repeat 2 times)﻿tuck your fingers under using two handsGiant shark doo doo, doo doo (repeat 2 times)﻿fully extend both armsStory: I'm the Biggest Thing in the Ocean by Kevin Sherry     This book presents a great opportunity to talk about the variety of creatures in the ocean. The main character is a giant squid who compares his large size to everyone else he meets: shrimp, clams, turtles, an octopus, jellyfish... He determines that he's the biggest thing in the ocean. At least one child always pipes in to say that whales are bigger, and lo and behold, on the next page, our giant squid friend discovers this fact is true. Bright, simple illustrations make this a great read aloud!Story: Swimmy by Leo Lionni     Swimmy also explores the variety of creatures in the ocean, but it tells a story of working together to overcome a problem, too. After Swimmy's school is swallowed up by a large tuna--only Swimmy, the fastest swimmer, escapes--Swimmy solitarily explores the sea. When he finds another school of fish to join, they are too afraid of being eaten to venture out and explore. Swimmy thinks up a plan to defeat this problem: swimming together as a big fish to scare away predators. Lionni's illustrations and quiet stories are classics for a reason.Felt Rhyme: \"Five Little Fishies\"     I do this rhyme with the help of colorful felt fish and an alligator puppet, but I show kids how they can do it with just their hands, too.Five Little FishiesFive little fishies swimming in the seaTeasing Mr. Alligator, \"You can't catch me!\"Along comes Mr. Alligator, as quiet as can be,And he snatches that fish right out of the sea!﻿repeat by counting downStory: The Pout-Pout Fish by Deborah Diesen     This book was nominated for a Building Block Picture Book Award in Missouri a few years back. It has some repetitive rhyming text without becoming trite or laborious, and the kids usually love making the dejected \"blub\" noises of the pout-pout fish. Mr. Fish is always is a gloomy mood, spreading the dreary-wearies. He claims he can't help being pouty because of the shape of his mouth-- that is, until he discovers his fishy face could serve another, less gloomy purpose.Closing Song: \"If You're Happy and You Know It\"     I adapted the song to include some under-the-sea-themed actions, including swimming with fins and being a shark.

{"title": null, "date": "Monday, April 16, 2012", "text": "Had you heard about this past weekend being the 100th anniversary of the sinking of the Titanic? There have been enough new books on the subject released in the past few months to remind everyone in the library of this historically significant date, and both adult and children's services at my branch have Titanic-themed materials displays this month. Since children's always has more fun, though, we went beyond the display to commemorate this event: we had a Titanic-themed sink or float program. History and science! Perfect.Books and building materialsThe school-age program opened with my asking the kids what they knew about the Titanic. I had a few mention the whole iceberg-sinking thing, a few talk about there not being enough life boats for all the passengers, and one who pointed out the 100-year anniversary. All of the kids were really into hearing as much about the Titanic as they could--what is it about a good disaster story that captivates kids? After we had exhausted everyone's general knowledge, I dimmed the lights and projected a great, short educational video about the disaster on the wall. So much information fit into a four-minute video! When the lights came back on, we quickly recapped what the kids had learned (how luxurious the ocean-liner was, the number of passengers on board, how long it took the Carpathia to get to the survivors, etc.).Our demonstration vessel, the R.M.S. PestoIt was then time to discuss how an \"unsinkable\" ship could, in fact, sink. Using a big, clear tub filled with water and an ice cube tray, I talked a bit about the sealed compartments in the Titanic's design--how the ship was created to withstand an event in which four compartments were filled with water, but ultimately six filled compartments spelled the ship's doom. Using the ice cube tray to demonstrate how water-filled compartments affected the ship worked well; the kids were really able to visualize at what point our \"ship\" would go under.The rest of the program (the majority, really, at 30 of the total 45 minutes) was spent in our \"sink or float\" activity. Kids could work individually or in groups to try to create their very own seaworthy (or, in our case, tub-worthy) vessels. Everyone had the same materials: a few sheets of paper, a few feet of aluminum foil, some modeling clay, some twist ties, and as many pipe cleaners, popsicle sticks, and plastic straws as they wanted. The goal was to create a boat that would not only float on its own, but would also support a passenger: a plastic rat. (I was trying to be historically accurate...)Rat overboard!Piecing together a pontoonSome of the young engineers drew sketches of their plans first, others got right to the creation of their boats. I walked around the room asking questions about what materials and designs they were using, and for the few who seemed to finish building quickly, I asked questions about what they thought would happen once the boat was in water. I got some really in-depth, thoughtful answers--the kids were obviously really getting into the challenge of creating a boat that would float.My, she was yar.With five minutes left, we began testing the nautical creations in our tub. I am happy to report that while we did have a few capsizes, no boat completely sank--and our rat would have had time to be rescued based on each of our trials. Nonetheless, a few kids remarked that they should have made lifeboats to go with their creations. Just look at that combined application of historical AND scientific knowledge!I'm happy to report that all of our remaining Titanic resources were checked out following the program, and many of the kids were excited to take their creations home to share with siblings and family members. For a program based around an historical tragedy, our history-and-science day was surely a success."},

These novels are meant to appeal to kids in the fourth through sixth grades, and the topics and genres always run the gamut--there's something to appeal to every Missouri reader in that age range! Many, many kids come to the library looking specifically for Mark Twain books, so I make a point of familiarizing myself with all of them. I just started in on the 2012-2013 nominated titles. First on my list: the audiobook version of Matthew J. Kirby's The Clockwork Three.The Clockwork Three tells the story of three children in an unnamed, steampunk American city. Giuseppe is originally from Italy but, after his parents' death and his sale to a not-so-nice guy who exploits children in the New World, he has been slaving away as a street musician for over half his life. When he finds a green violin washed up near the docks, he starts to think that escaping his busker life and returning to Italia might be a possibility. Then there's Frederick, a precocious clockmaker's apprentice. He is obsessed with clockwork automatons and perfecting his secret creation for the clockmakers guild, but he routinely shoves aside the lingering curiosity and hurt he feels regarding his becoming an orphan. Lastly there is Hannah, a bright young girl who has been forced to get a job as a hotel maid after her father's sudden and drastic illness. Hannah overhears talk of a fortune hidden in the hotel, and she sets her sights on finding it in an effort to alleviate the financial and mental strains on her mother, father, and twin sisters.The chapters rotate through focusing on each of the three protagonists, and eventually their storylines intersect as the three children become friends. They've all been loners of sorts, but they develop fondnesses for one another and realize that together they may be able to meet each of their goals. Together the clockwork three dash through city streets, brave the wild park of the city, encounter quite a few enemies who have ill intentions toward them, and embark on a series of adventures that tests their mettle beyond anything they had expected.The action of the story is evenly-paced and keeps one's attention, and the reader (Marc Thompson) performs a variety of strong voices to further illuminate the story. The audiobook is nearly twelve hours long, so it's a large chunk of a story--but there is more than enough intrigue and character to keep listeners engaged. I enjoyed hearing The Clockwork Three develop, and I would definitely recommend the audiobook to school-age kids looking for something for long car rides during upcoming summer vacations. The 2012-2013 Mark Twain Readers Award nominees are certainly off to a good start."},

There are so many fun poetry activities out there--magnetic poetry, mad libs poetry, writing and decorating haikus (just to name a few)--so many options for engaging school-age kids with poetry.My Poetry in the Library program featured three core elements. The kids and I first shared some of our favorite poems; I shared Lewis Carroll's \"How Doth the Little Crocodile.\" One program attendee recited for us from memory--she's involved in a speech competition and regular recites poetry for her events.Next we flexed our creative muscles with an adaptation of a random word poetry challenge from YA author John Corey Whaley and his friend Randi Anderson. I had chosen five \"random\" words for our flash poetry exercise: library, book, read, imagine, and listen. (The idea was that, should they choose to, kids could leave one of their reading-themed poems in the library for the rest of National Poetry Month; thus those five words.) We spent a solid twenty minutes experimenting with using these words in poems. We talked about rhyming versus non-rhyming poems, haikus and syllables, acrostic poems, etc., and all the kids' creative juices really seemed to be flowing. They produced some great flash poems! I've included an example that is currently on display at my library.We wrapped up the program by wandering the stacks for book spine poem inspiration. Have you ever made a book spine poem? It's lots of fun, and kids of every age and reading level seem to get really into it. Find an assortment of books whose titles, when arranged deliberately one on top of the next, create a poem when the spines are read top to bottom. Travis Jonker over at 100 Scope Notes is a big proponent of book spine poetry for National Poetry Month--you can check out some really fabulous kid-created book spine poems on his blog. I love that creating book spine poetry works the brain in a completely different way than writing poetry from scratch or even from a few buzz words--suddenly the activity becomes more explicitly like a puzzle. The resulting poems are always so much different than what the kids create freehand!All in all, while my Poetry in the Library program was not as well attended as some of my science and theme-specific programs for school-age kids (think Star Wars, Lego Club, or American Girl Club), it was a really enjoyable time in which kids could be totally free and creative. By the end of the program, they were all so proud of the poetry they had produced--as they should be! I highly recommend encouraging play with words at your library in celebration of National Poetry Month."},

We visit local preschools and day cares to provide story times; have tables at school fairs and literacy nights; and partner with local moms groups to provide programming for young children. This past weekend I represented my library at a local mothers club's annual egg hunt at a nearby park--activities included the egg hunt, pony rides, a bounce house, pictures with the Easter bunny, and a balloon animal-creating clown. And, of course, the library's craft table!What type of craft to you plan when you know you'll a) be outdoors for two hours, b) work with a wide variety of ages, and c) serve a possible 200 people? An easy spring butterfly, of course!This craft requires three supplies: a coffee filter, markers, and a pipe cleaner. Kiddos get to color their coffee filters however they please. When the coloring is complete, both the coffee filter and pipe cleaner are folded in half. For optimal butterfly shape, the open end of the pipe cleaner goes over the open end of the coffee filter. At that point, all that's left is to scrunch the coffee filter a bit and twist the pipe cleaner into antennae. Ta-da! A colorful, spring-y butterfly that was a cinch to make!"},

We stuck some up all around the children's section of the library and encouraged kiddos to try to find and count them all (I put up eleven in total). Every child who reported the number of hats he or she found, regardless of the number reported, got to choose a Dr. Seuss-themed reading sticker and a Read Across America bookmark. It was simple, it was cheap, and it impacted a lot of library customers.This seek-and-find was a great opportunity to mix simple math skills into a passive library program--at least twice a day I heard hat-related counting going on throughout the building. Kiddos got really excited at the prospect of a treasure hunt in the library, too, and they loved that the theme was something as recognizable as Dr. Seuss.Give a seek-and-find a try at your library! I'd love to hear what themes and activities work for you."},

The Cold War with the Russians is on lots of people's minds, but Alex and her brother Chuck are more interested in just one facet of the US/Russia conflict: the Space Race. Alex looks up to Chuck who, despite a propensity for doing things his own way (which occasionally involves disreputable behavior), fancies himself a student of everything related to one day going to space--radio, radar, rocketry, etc. Alex is fully involved in all of Chuck's adventures, and she strives to be an adventure-seeking woman like Amelia Earhart.Alex and Chuck's dream starts to seem more possible when Captain Ebbs moves in down the street. Alex befriends her, and Ebbs begins sharing her stories of flight, what is necessary to theoretically put humans in space, and the rocketry work of Dr. Wernher von Braun (remember him in October Sky?). Both Alex and Chuck befriend Ebbs, and although Ebbs is skeptical of Chuck's methods and his sometimes negative influence on his sister, she takes them both under her wing. Their adventures culminate in a boating trip down the Potomac with the possibility of seeing a secret military facility rocket launch when they reach their destination. It is during this trip that we see both the true potential and the sincere motivations of our characters.I really enjoyed the character of Alex--her thoughts and considerations about her family and the world around her ring true, and she is a believable young girl with a goal to get to space one day. Most of the other characters in the novel aren't quite as strongly sketched, but I don't think that fact detracts from the appeal that Alex and her adventures will have for young readers. The plot could be more even-paced and the ending not quite so hastily tied together, but the story works and will likely hold the attention of its audience.This book also serves as a great addition to historical fiction set in the early Cold War--on numerous occasions Alex asserts that she wants to fly and go to space despite her mother's insistence that girls don't do those things. Seeing Alex strive to do what she loves despite her gender, as well as the strong female role model she finds in Ebbs, helps paint a picture for young readers of how gender norms were much more restricting than they likely experience today. I'll be recommending this book for readers third- through sixth-grade who are interested in historical fiction, space, and girls' adventure stories.Racing the Moon will be released by Random House on June 26, 2012."},
{"title": null, "date": "Tuesday, March 27, 2012", "text": "It seems like almost every kiddo who walks into my library likes Star Wars. Our Star Wars books are always shelved on a special display, and it's a rare day we have more than five or six checked in for perusal. I'm always overhearing discussions about the films or tv show, and one fervent fan recommended I listen to the Star Wars Radio Drama that was on NPR a while back. These kiddos love Star Wars. So, this spring break, we gave them a Star Wars program.My library's Star Wars: Jedi Academy program was born of an article in the September 2011 issue of ALSConnect (now ALSC Matters!)--it gives tons of ideas for games and other activities to make any library's Star Wars program absolutely stellar. Using the rubric described there, we fleshed out our program to make it interesting to as many kiddos as possible.Star Wars: Jedi Academy was a carnival-style program. It was advertised on our program calendar as an hour-long event for all ages, but we made sure to tell folks who registered that they could come and go as they pleased during that time frame. The program description invited young Jedis to come practice and perfect their Jedi skills through a variety of activities and stations. Our final program set-up included nine distinct areas:1. The Cantina -- We had small snacks available since the program took place at afternoon snack time. We used awesome cupcake stencils from Williams-Sonoma to decorate some of the platters of cookies.2. Origami Yoda Table -- We had instructions on hand as well as lots of bright green cardstock and markers for drawing faces.3. Coloring Table -- I printed off some big coloring pages I found by browsing online. Most popular were Chewbacca, Darth Vader, and R2-D2. (I was particularly proud of the sign I made for this station!)4. Jedi Library -- Every Star Wars book, DVD, and CD in my library that was available for check-out at the time of the program made it onto the shelves of the Jedi Library. By the end of the program, nothing was left.5. Droid Toss -- I spray-painted and decorated some dollar-store trash bins to look as much like droids as possible, and kiddos tried to toss balls into as many as they could in four tries (a la Bozo Buckets).6. Garbage Compactor Dive -- An old deliveries box was decorated with the labeling of the garbage compactor in Episode IV, and it was filled with dollar-store party favor prizes and lots of shredded paper that we saved from the recycle bin. Each young Jedi was blindfolded, spun around a few times, and then entreated to use the Force to find a prize amidst all the \"trash.\"7. Laser Blaster Target Practice -- A co-worker laminated some images of notorious Star Wars bad guys, and they were stuck to a window on our program room wall. Kiddos used Nerf guns with suction ammo to practice their blaster skills.8. Lightsaber Practice -- Young Jedis were pitted against one another as they attempted to keep a balloon afloat as long as possible using only a lightsaber.9. Jedi Archives Trivia -- A very enthusiastic and knowledgeable teen volunteer created easy, medium, and difficult trivia to test the knowledge of young Jedis in attendance.The last five stations, all games, were staffed by either library children's staff or teen volunteers. Each of those stations involved a prize--a piece of candy, a Lego Star Wars sticker, a paper Star Wars character medallion, or the prize from the garbage compactor.Our program was also lucky enough to have some costumed visitors on hand. I had put in an appearance request with the 501st Legion, and we ended up with two Stormtroopers, one Clone Trooper, and one Jedi Master in attendance throughout the program. Lots of the kiddos had attended in costumes of their own, but the looks of awe and excitement upon seeing \"real\" Imperial Soldiers and a Jedi Master were absolutely wonderful. These guys were incredibly professional and friendly, too, posing for tons of pictures with kiddos and taking it in stride when a Nerf dart inevitably became stuck to one of their costumes.As excited as I was about offering the Star Wars: Jedi Academy program during spring break, I could not have anticipated just how popular it ultimately was. We had 170 people attend during the course of the hour-long event--parents mentioned that they had a hard time finding parking spots in our lot! Attendees were largely school-age with a handful of equally-excited preschoolers and teens (as well as some parents who were thrilled to share Star Wars with their kids in a new way!).So many kiddos were beyond enthusiastic, and they've already been asking when the library will offer the program again. With all of the game supplies and decorations we have packed away in our storage room, I can happily say we'll have another Jedi Academy somewhere down the road.Give this or a similar Star Wars program a try at your library, and may the Force be with you."},

Her older sister Lynette is back in town toting her young son Rudy, and Rebel is sent to live with them for the summer--it's Rebel's job to look after Rudy while Lynette goes to beauty school. Rebel remains fixated on getting the money to go to the August Kids' Dig, and when she meets a bratty neighbor girl who brags about winning $500 in a beauty pageant, Rebel enters with her eyes on the prize.Rebel and Rudy also befriend a few of their kinder neighbors, including Lacey Jane, a girl Rebel's age who enters the pageant as well, and Miss Odenia, an older woman who offers to train the girls for the pageant in exchange for their serving at her card parties. Throughout the summer, Rebel uses her keen skills of observation (essential for any paleontologist) to notice some of the living things around her for a change: she develops a friendship with Lacey Jane, starts to understand her older sister, and begins to see Rudy as more than just a nuisance. Everything leads up to the pageant itself, when it's up to Rebel to take the stage and decide who she really is.I love Rebel's voice throughout this entire book. She is not always the most likable young girl which, in my opinion, makes for the perfect narrator for a book for pre-teen girls. Rebel struggles between going after what she wants with little concern for others--she thinks some mean thoughts at times--and realizing that the people around her might have wishes and goals that they care about just as much as she does her own. I loved seeing the feisty, whip-smart Rebel try to weave together her identities as goal-oriented future paleontologist (the Ice Age kind, not the dinosaur kind), defender of the downtrodden, and caring sister, aunt, and friend. Her evolution feels so true to what girls her age think and feel over the course of a few months, and it's always wonderful to see a strong female character come out on the other side just as strong as she starts out.I also really enjoyed the bits between the chapters in this book--including some excerpts from Rebel's \"field notes\" from the summer, pictures drawn by Rudy, and pages from Lynette's cosmetology textbook. These snippets into the lives of the characters make the story that much more rich. I'll be recommending Rebel McKenzie to girls in the third- through sixth-grade range, and I'll also promote it for a Mark Twain Readers Award when it is eligible to be a nominee.Rebel McKenzie will be released by Disney-Hyperion on June 26, 2012."},
{"title": null, "date": "Friday, March 23, 2012", "text": "The unusually warm weather of late has put me in mind of picnics and gardens, and I decided to offer some story times in the last few weeks on one of my favorite picnics/gardens themes: fruits and veggies! It's a topic every kiddo knows something about, and it has the potential to introduce some good vocabulary with different fruit/veggie names as well as shapes and colors when you look at pictures of each type of food.Opening Song: \"Open, Shut Them\"Story: Gladys Goes Out to Lunch by Derek Anderson     What's not to love about a big purple gorilla? Gladys, who lives at the zoo, loves bananas. She could (and does) eat bananas morning, noon, and night. One day, however, she catches a whiff of some other food--and it smells delicious. Gladys leaves the zoo in pursuit of the yummy smell, and despite trying several tasty foods along her journey, she almost can't find the one that smells so good. When she finally does, she discovers that it's twist on her favorite: banana bread!Story: The Little Mouse, the Red Ripe Strawberry, and the Big Hungry Bear by Don and Audrey Wood     In this cute, simple tale with great illustrations, the story is told as though the readers/listeners are interacting with the little mouse on the pages of the book. The little mouse has located the perfect red, ripe strawberry, and the reader encourages him to save it from a big hungry bear who loves the fruit. Poor mouse, he tries to hide, lock up, and disguise that giant berry before the reader suggests cutting it in two and eating it together. It's a great book with lots of opportunities for dialogic reading.Felt Board/Fingerplay: \"Five Red Ripe Strawberries\"     I used Abby the Librarian's rhyme as the basis for this interactive felt board. I had five big strawberries up on the felt board, and as the big hungry bear came and ate each one, I asked the kiddos to help keep track of how many were left by counting on their fingers. Great for counting skills and motor skills! The rhyme how I used it:Five red ripe strawberries, sweet to the core.Big hungry bear came and ate one (yummy noises),and then there were four.Four red ripe strawberries, sitting in a tree.Big hungry bear came and ate one (yummy noises),and then there were three.Three red ripe strawberries, one for you and you and you.Big hungry bear came and ate one (yummy noises),and then there were two.Two red ripe strawberries, shining in the sun.Big hungry bear came and ate one (yummy noises),and then there was one.One red ripe strawberry, left all alone.Big hungry bear came and ate it (yummy noises),and then there were none.Book: No More Vegetables! by Nicole Rubel     Ruthie asserts that she hates vegetables. She'll feed them to her dog, hide them... she'll do pretty much anything to make sure she doesn't have to eat them. Like a lot of young children, she refuses to even try them--she just knows she won't like them. After she begins helping to plant and tend a vegetable garden, however, Ruthie starts to see these foods in a different way. She succumbs to eating a grape tomato when she is overcome with hunger in the garden, and suddenly Ruthie realizes that vegetables are actually pretty good.Song: \"Fruit Salad Salsa\" by Laurie Berkner     This peppy song is a fruit-filled take on the hokey-pokey. Kids get to put their hands in, shake, jump, twirl, and have all sorts of dancing fun. It feels so good to move around after those several books!Book: Up, Down, and Around by Katherine Ayres     I let the kids stay standing from our dancing for this story, as it has lots of opportunity for movement. The kids in the book work together to plant and take care of a garden, and the words and illustrations introduce all sorts of vegetables (and a few fruits!) with mentions of whether they grow up, down, or around. I have the kiddos use their hands to move however the text says, and they enjoy pretending to be corn, carrots, and other yummy things.Matching Game: Making a Fruit Salad     For our last activity, I like to encourage color skills in tandem with the vocabulary from the theme. I had printed out lots of yellow bananas, purple grapes, green pears, blue blueberries, and red strawberries, and I laminated them and attached little Velcro dots to the backs. Each kiddo got three pieces of fruit, and together we put them on the felt board one type at a time. Again as per Abby the Librarian, we sang a little song as we put our fruits up on the board:(To the tune of Ten Little Indians)Add the strawberries to our fruit saladAdd the strawberries to our fruit saladAdd the strawberries to our fruit saladMmm, Mmm! It tastes so good!Craft: Fruit Loop Necklaces     We had a \"craft picnic\" (a.k.a. we did the craft sitting on the story time rug) where every kiddo got a piece of yarn with tape on the end for easier stringing of fruit-colored cereals. I mentioned to caregivers the options of asking color names as the child strung each O on the yarn, or for older ones, encouraging a pattern of colors. While dropped and stepped-on pieces did make this craft a bit messy, it comes with a built-in system for telling when everyone is finished: they stop stringing the Os and start eating them instead!Other books I had on hand in case they were needed:Jamberry by Bruce DegenPie in the Sky by Lois Ehlert"},

At the recommendation of a teacher friend, I picked these books from the juvenile graphic novel shelves at my branch. He was right, I was in for a good story and some really lovely art.Emily and Navin Hayes have just moved into their great-grandfather's old house with their mother not long after the death of their father. This house is old and dusty and somewhat strange, and cleaning it seems synonymous with exploring its secrets. Then, in a quick series of events, Emily discovers an amulet necklace; her mother is attacked by a strange, unearthly creature; and the whole family finds themselves in another world entirely. Just when they thought they were establishing a new normal for their family...The adventures of Emily, Navin, and the friends they meet are not at all limited to saving the children's mother; it would seem the wearer of the amulet--a stonekeeper--is destined for greater battles in this land of Alledia. These first four volumes are filled with action, intrigue, bravery, sacrifice, and suspense enough to really captivate all readers, even those who are initially drawn only to the bright, engaging illustrations. I'll be recommending this series for readers third grade and up who are interested in stories of adventure, fantasy, and the power in every child. Recommended for reluctant readers as well."},
{"title": null, "date": "Wednesday, March 21, 2012", "text": "What better way is there to celebrate being off of school and on spring break than making slime at the library? I asked myself this question while developing my library's spring programming schedule, and I decided that our branch was absolutely going to get slimed.The Slime Science program involved around 25 school-age kiddos out on the library's patio--by all means, do this program outdoors, as it is MESSY! Once everyone had gotten settled onto their sit-upon cushions, I showed them how to make our slime: I mixed about three cups of corn starch in a clear tub with approximately two cups of water. It takes a good five-ish minutes to stir these ingredients together into a slime, and I took that time to chat with everyone about states of matter. The kiddos were quick to name solids, liquids, and gases, and they had good examples of each and were able to mention some of their properties (good job, science teachers!).As my slime began to reach completion, I asked everyone if they thought a substance could act like two different types of matter. This question certainly piqued their interest, and I introduced the concept of non-Newtonian fluids--in this case, a substance that acts like both a solid and a liquid. This slime acts like a solid when pressure is applied to it (e.g., if you try to squish it or shape it, it resists changing its shape), but it will flow and drip like a liquid when left alone. They loved learning this term; I'm a firm believer in not trying to simplify language for children.﻿﻿Acting like a solid......and like a liquid!At this point I invited the kiddos to come up to the tub of slime in small groups to touch it and see it for themselves. A great demonstration pattern was to invite them to slowly dip a finger in the slime; it feels like a slightly thick water. I would then tell them to try to yank the finger out quickly; at this sudden application of force, the slime resists and the finger doesn't slide right out. The looks of fascination and excitement on the kiddos' faces when they experienced this phenomenon for themselves were great.After we had cycled everyone through the demonstration tub, it was time for us all to make our own slime. I had prepared baby food jars of corn starch for all of the participants, and with the help of a colleague and a teen volunteer, every program participant added some food coloring and water to their jars. They each went back to their sit-upons to stir their mixtures with a popsicle stick until the right consistency was reached. I had anticipated needing more corn starch to balance the overly watery batches of slime, and it was a good thing I had--at least half of the kiddos needed to add more corn starch to their jars to get good slime. This bit of trial and error gave us great opportunities to talk about science and experimentation, and it helped pass the bit of time it took to get everyone's slime ready.We spent the last bit of the program pouring our slimes into our hands and playing with its solid-and-liquid properties. Some of the kiddos said it was gross; some said it seemed impossible how the slime could be both runny and firm; and some said they couldn't wait to share the experiment with siblings and parents at home. Everyone got to take home their jars of slime--each jar affixed with a label warning not to put it down the drain. My library colleagues mentioned they heard all sorts of excited and positive comments about the program as kiddos and their families made their way out of the library. Educational and fun!One of the best parts of this program is how easy and inexpensive it is. If you regularly collect baby food jars from coworkers, the only real costs are corn starch and food coloring. As far as prep for the program was concerned, I did spend a bit of time getting the individual jars ready with labels and corn starch. Other than that, all of the work was during the program helping everyone to get a good-consistency slime.Oh, and cleaning up did take a bit of time. I did mention this program was messy, right?"},
{"title": null, "date": "Sunday, March 18, 2012", "text": "While I do quite a few preschool/day care outreach story times every month, in the springtime I visit even more of these locations than usual. I love getting to reach an audience of kiddos who might only hear a library story time once or twice a year. And while visiting so many locations might seem daunting as far a planning is concerned, I usually plan one awesome and adaptable story time that I can use throughout March, April, and May as I visit these one-time outreach groups. Sure, I end up reading the same books a lot--but that's why I choose to forego a theme and instead share some of my favorites!Here's a look at my current spring story time outreach program plan:Opening Song:\"Open, Shut Them\"Open, shut them (open and close hands)Open, shut them (open and close hands)Give a little clap, clap, clap!Open, shut them (open and close hands)Open, shut them (open and close hands)Put them in your lap!     I use this opening song for all of my preschool story times. I've enjoyed seeing the groups I visit frequently learn the song--they know that it signals story time is about to start. With groups I'm visiting for the first time, it's a quick way to get kids' wiggles out before settling into the first story.Story: What Will Fat Cat Sit On? by Jan Thomas     I think Jan Thomas can do no wrong when it comes to quick, goofy, engaging stories for pre-readers of almost any age. I preface this book by saying that the story is kind of silly--and the kiddos immediately begin giggling. The whole narration consists questions about what Fat Cat should sit on (The cow? No! The chicken? No! Etc.), and kids love the great illustrations and the zany idea of a fat cat sitting on a pig. Simple and guaranteed to start the story time off right!Story: The Chicken of the Family by Mary Amato OR Stop Snoring, Bernard! by Zachariah Ohora     For slightly older kids, I'll read Amato's The Chicken of the Family, a story about young Henrietta and her two older sisters who tease her about being a chicken. It's a longer story, but it has really held the attentions of four- and five-year-olds. After all, what preschool hasn't experienced a bit of teasing at the hands of an older relative?For younger kids, I'll read the newer Stop Snoring, Bernard! by Ohora. Poor Bernard, he really wants to get along with all his zoo friends, but his loud snoring drives them all batty. This is a great story about why being nice to your friends is important.Fingerplay: \"Two Little Parrots\"     As an intro to my next story, which features a parrot, I changed the birds in this simple fingerplay from blackbirds to parrots. Sometimes I have the kiddos just mirror my actions, sometimes I repeat twice so they can learn the words, too.Story: Terrific by Jon Agee     This is definitely one of my favorite stories. A grumpy old man named Eugene expects the worst in every situation: when he wins a trip to Bermuda, he's sure he'll get sunburned; when he floats to a deserted island after his cruise ship crashes, he's convinced he'll be eaten by cannibals. (Note: I love when a preschooler then asks, \"What's a cannibal?\" They think the idea of a person who eats people is utterly ridiculous.) In actuality, he finds he's alone on this island with a parrot who, while he cannot fly because of a busted wing, does happen to know how to build a boat. This is a great story of friendship and a positive attitude, and it also introduces kids to the word \"terrific\" and, for the oldest ones, the concept of sarcasm.Story: Pete the Cat: I Love My White Shoes by Eric Litwin     This first picture book featuring Pete the Cat was overwhelmingly voted the best read-aloud picture book by Missouri preschoolers and kindergarteners last year. It's been a mainstay of my preschool story times--in fact, I still bring it to a number of the locations I visit monthly because they usually beg me to read it again. It's a great story about a cat who loves his white shoes so much he creates a song about them. And when he steps in messy things and his shoes change colors? He just adapts the words to his song! The kiddos are always excited to shout out the color Pete's shoes have changed, and they love singing his song with him. I don't mind rereading this one--by the third or fourth time they hear it, the kiddos are \"reading\" it right along with me!Song: \"Alligator!\"     I bring Al, my alligator puppet, to help sing a few verses of this camp song. I explain that Al is going to say the world \"alligator,\" and it is the children's job to repeat it back to him. If he says it normally, they say it normally; if he says it quietly; they say it quietly; if he says it silly, they say it silly. They love getting to be goofy and loud with their voices at this point in story time, and they think Al is just hilarious when he pretends to be my shoe or my belt.Story: There's an Alligator Under My Bed by Mercer Mayer     Mercer Mayer has written so many classics that translate really well to preschool story times. I love reading this story of a boy who schemes to get a good night's sleep by getting rid of the alligator living under his bed. This story is an exciting, quick tale that simultaneously quells fears of what lives under your bed and touts the ingenious problem-solving abilities of young kids. The artwork and page turns make for a great, suspenseful story, and its lightheartedly ominous ending always leaves kids smiling.Closing Song:\"Clap, Clap, Clap Your Hands!\"Clap, clap, clap your hands!Clap your hands together.Clap, clap, clap your hands!Clap your hands together.Stomp, stomp, stomp your feet!Stomp your feet together.Stomp, stomp, stomp your feet!Stomp your feet together.(add any other actions you want!)Wave, wave, wave goodbye!Wave goodbye together.Wave, wave, wave goodbye!Wave goodbye together.     Depending on just how much time I've got left at the end of my story times, I'll either close with \"If You're Happy and You Know It\" or this song, which lends itself to being extended as necessary. My kiddos always appreciate the chance to wiggle and make noise by the time we're finished with all our stories, and ending with everyone waving goodbye is a seamless way for me to make my exit. Until next time, that is!"},
{"title": null, "date": "Sunday, March 18, 2012", "text": "Wonder, a novel by R. J. Palacio, tells the story of August Pullman who, after having been homeschooled all his life, is just beginning the fifth grade at a New York school. Fifth grade at this school marks the beginning of middle school, a transition that could be tough for any kid. Right from the start, though, August lets the reader know why starting middle school might be just a bit tougher for him: he was born with severe facial abnormalities, and despite numerous reconstructive surgeries, he still looks different. Noticeably different. He says he's grown used to the shocked and horrified looks of passers-by on the street, but he's not sure he's ready to face his peers at school day after day after day.This story is primarily about August and his first year of middle school, but Palacio makes it so much deeper by rotating the narrators throughout the story. We start off seeing this year of change from August's perspective, then from his sister Via's perspective as she begins high school at a school where almost no one knows about her family \"situation.\" We also get to see this year from the point of view of Summer, a girl who befriends August on the first day of school through the simple act of sitting with him at lunch, and of Jack, a boy who begins the school year feeling obligated to be August's friend.These different narrators show quite clearly that, while August's struggles might be more obvious than most, no kid in middle or high school is really playing with a full deck of cards. You might seem popular but be hiding a painful divorce at home; you might feel like the token \"poor kid\" at your school; you might feel completely unsupported at home and thus wholly unsure of yourself. Palacio does a magnificent job of telling a beautiful story while also highlighting the theme that no one feels fully secure in his- or herself--and in that we are all very, very alike, no matter how different we may seem.I'd be surprised if Wonder isn't a major Newbery contender for this year, and I'll be recommending it for fourth-grade-and-up readers looking for a great book or to supplement their reading of the state award-nominated titles. Highly recommended."},
{"title": null, "date": "Wednesday, March 14, 2012", "text": "Didn't you just love science when you were a kid? Miss Frizzle and her Magic School Bus gang always had the most wonderful, quietly-educational adventures; Bill Nye made everything about science seem cool and understandable; and, frankly, the possibility of something blowing up or doing something similarly awesome seemed omnipresent. Science rocked.That's why I offer regular science programming at my library.On a recent evening, about 20 school-age kiddos came to my library for a Food Science program. I had set up our program room with three distinct stations: the \"appetizer\" taste test station; the \"entree\" heat station; and the \"dessert\" cold station. These stations were on the peripheries of the room, and kids sat on sit-upons in the middle.I opened the program talking a bit about the science of taste--tastes buds, four flavors (salty, sweet, bitter, sour), etc. Everyone in the room received a map of the human tongue with blank lines pointing at each of the four main taste hubs, then they crowded around the testing station. I had set up four testing groups, each with salty (salt water), sweet (sugar water), bitter (tonic water), and sour (lemon juice) solutions and plenty of q-tips for dipping and applying to the tongue. (I emphasized very strongly that each taste needed to be done with a fresh, clean q-tip; I didn't observe any double-dipping.) The kids pressed each solution-soaked q-tip to the four areas of their tongues with the goal of identifying which area is most sensative to which taste. I've never seen so many kids make sour-puss faces at the same time! After we had gone over the official tongue taste map, we moved along to talking about heat. We talked about evaporation and heat with the assistance of a potato and potato chips, and then we talked about melting using the glory that is an ironed cheese sandwich. The kiddos thought it was crazy perfection to wrap a cheese sandwich in foil; iron the packet with a hot clothes iron (no steam function!); and then enjoy a gooey-centered ironed cheese sandwich. (Note: If you want to use this activity in your library, pre-iron all but the example sandwich before the program and then just briefly reheat--otherwise the process takes too long.) We then took about ten minutes to enjoy our ironed cheese sandwich and potato chips dinner while talking about our favorite science topics.Dessert is the epitome of saving the best for last, is it not? We talked about cold and the process of freezing, and then I wheeled out the last activity: ice cream in a bag. We used this activity frequently at the summer camp where I counseled, and I'm happy to say that, though messy, it translated well to a library food science program. Every kid got a baggy of a milk, vanilla, and sugar mixture, and then found a shaking buddy to share the task of shaking a bag filled with salted ice and the sealed mixtures. Some of the ice creams turned out icier or more frozen than others, but even the kids who ended up drinking their mixtures said they enjoyed the experiment. The failed tests were a great opportunity for further talking about temperature, too.In addition to having books with food science experiments available for the kiddos to check out as they left, I had two handouts they could take with them: one with the recipes from the program, and another with a Coloring with Foods activity from the American Chemical Society. And while I was in the program room cleaning up for a solid half hour after the program let out, my coworkers assured me that they heard nothing put positive comments from kids and their families as they checked out.Science programming in the library: a fun, fascinating, and often zany experience for everyone!"},

In the seven months that I've been the children's librarian at my mid-size branch library, I've gotten to read some fantastic books; meet some inspiring young readers; network and swap ideas with colleagues; and offer some tremendous programs for children of all ages. Now that I've gotten into the basic rhythm of everything my job entails, I figure it's time I start sharing my adventures in reading, programming, and advocating for young people.These are the voyages of a children's librarian in the Show Me State."}
