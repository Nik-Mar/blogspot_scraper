{"title": "Year Lists", "date": "Monday 15 January 2024", "text": "I've always been a great maker of lists - things to do, books to read, all sorts of things. I keep an ideas book which was originally intended to be ideas for knitting or crochet designs but over the years it's relaxed to include everything from quotations to plants for the garden and lots of other things besides.For the last three or four years I've also kept yearly lists on the computer (or Mabel as she's known to me) to record things I've achieved each year. Now that there are so many things I can't do, it's good to see what I have managed over the previous twelve months. My 'miles walked' lists are a bit sad. The year before I got covid, I walked about 700 miles. It's surprising how it adds up; I use a very simple pedometer that goes in my pocket or bag, every time I leave the house so those 700 miles aren't just made up 'proper' walks but also lots of walks to the postbox or in to town. A couple of  years ago I'd managed to walk about 300 miles, all in very short, daily walks but last year my Long Covid was worse and I only did about half that. I also keep lists of books that I read, not as a target but just for fun so that I can look back and see what I was reading. Last year, I started listing how many crosswords I'd finished too. I do the daily cryptic crossword from The Guardian (I love being able to print it off) and, in 2023, I finished 109 of them. Given that they publish six a week, I've still got plenty of room for improvement. When he has time, my son also does the crossword and, over Christmas we did really well. Cryptic crosswords are easier to work on with someone else and we finished all but two in about two weeks.My other big yearly list is the one you might be most interested in though and you'll be glad to hear that this one includes pictures. Every year I list all the things I've made, whatever the craft. Since I started doing this a couple of years ago it's encouraged me to make more stuff which is always good, right? It also gives me a great sense of achievement; I may not be able to do most of the things I could do before getting ill but I can still be creative.I always start the year by knitting the mini stockings that go on my Christmas presents, filled with little chocolates. It gives me a good sense of getting ahead, even if it's all downhill from then on. These were the stockings I knitted last January.They were knitted with a three colour slip stitch pattern and solid coloured toes and heels. Working out how to keep the pattern going round the shaping for the instep was very tricky. This year's stockings have a Fair Isle pattern but I decided to make life easier for myself and only use the pattern on the straight leg section.As you can see, I'm getting on well with the next batch of stockings. One of my plans for this year is to go over all my old mini stocking patterns, re-write some and publish new ones.So, what else did I knit in 2023? Four and a half pairs of socks (the half was the first of a pair for me, all the rest were for other people), several scarves and two sets of Pippi baby clothes for new babies. They also got a Lazy Vee Blanket and a Paddle Ball each.A slightly older baby got a knitted Raggy Doll, another pattern that needs a complete re-write.Knitted toys can be a pain to make, what with all those pieces but the finished results are always pleasing. Last year I knitted two Frog and Toads on tiny needles, at a tight tension - never again. Mind you, they look brilliant.These are knitted with Shetland Wool which turned out to be ideal for small animals with a lot of shaping. I remembered this when it came to designing my Little Donkeys at the end of the year.I knitted a fully dressed hedgehog for a friend's birthday in the summer from Louise Crowther's book Knitted Animal Friends which I can thoroughly recommend. I bought the yarn to knit myself the owl from the same book but haven't made it yet. Something to do this year.I did though finally manage to knit myself a Kipper from the pattern by Alan Dart. The original pattern is for DK weight yarn and comes out too big for my tastes so I used thin 4 ply sock yarn and small needles to make a smaller dog.The shading between colours is done with an ordinary pencil which I thought was a clever touch. I updated the shapings a bit as I went along but, otherwise, followed the pattern.The rest of my knitting in 2023 was for published patterns, including two big ones: Summer Cottage and my Christmas Cheer wreath. I have been working on samples for two more Ten Stitch patterns as well, a rectangle and an oval. The rectangle is easy but I wanted to explain how to calculate how long the first strip needs to be for any finished size.The oval was much more complicated to work out and I needed the help of my mathematician son to write me a formula to explain what I'd knitted. The obvious use for a Ten Stitch Oval pattern would be for a rug but it could also be used for placemats or a knitted basket base. Maybe I'll get round to designing this one later this year.Most of my crochet in 2023 was, again, for published patterns. I've got one shawl waiting for me to write up which uses my Lazy Vee technique which I always enjoy working.Towards the end of the year, I discovered the technique know as Corner to Corner crochet or C2C and had fun making this scarf for a Christmas present.Again, this was fun to make and a great way to use self-striping yarn. I used King Cole Riot DK for my scarf. And I nearly forgot this little reindeer, crocheted from an old magazine pattern, again changing the weight of yarn to make it smaller. This one went in my daughter's Christmas stocking.One more woolly finish from 2023 before I move on to other crafts. In May I finally finished this rainbow Tunisian Crochet blanket, worked in the round, which I started years ago. It looks nice now it's done but it was an absolute nightmare to get it to lay flat. I kept having to re-do the edging to hold it in shape and then it took a lot of serious blocking. In the first few months of the year I made quite a lot of things with felt, starting off with these two Christmas tree ornaments for my son and daughter.These are copies of the one I made for my tree more than thirty years ago and which they irreverently refer to as the 'Hitler Santa'. I also made two sets of more traditional decorations. These were from the book Modern Folk Embroidery by Nancy Nicholson which has lots of great patterns.As you can see, I got a bit carried away when it came to the embroidery. I kept one of each set for myself but then hid them away until Christmas. Only of course when Christmas came I couldn't remember where I'd hidden them. They finally came to light last week at the back of  my sock drawer. Using the same book, I also made a pastel coloured felt garland for my daughter - still adding lots of embroidery.I had fun making some felt flowers too, all of which I gave away as presents. I'd like to make more of these at some point.The big flowers are from the book Fabric Blooms by Megan Hunt but I worked out the pattern for the little rosebuds myself.I borrowed a book from the library in the Spring called Stitch 50 Birds by Alison J Reid and used it to make four different bird ornaments as presents.Some of the patterns have quite a lot of pieces but the instructions are clear. I particularly liked the use of cocktail sticks for legs. There are other books in the series if you fancy making some felt creatures.I'm a big fan of Mandy Shaw of Dandelion Designs and, when I was well, used to enjoy visiting her stall at craft shows. This means I have quite a few of her patterns stashed away and, last year, I used a couple of them to make more presents. Three little redwork tree decorations (yes, mine was lost with the felt ones) and a little lampshade that goes over a wine glass with a battery tealight inside.I always start off the year with plans to make all the birthday cards I need to send but people born in the first half of the year tend to fare better than those with later birthdays. I cross stitched six cards last year; this is one of my favourites. It's by the designers Lesley Teare; I love the way she combines cross stitch with blackwork.I enjoyed working this cone shaped Father Christmas for a Christmas present too; it's cross stitch on plastic aida and came together well.I did manage to make one card with hardanger embroidery. I must do more of this in 2024; it's quite a new craft for me and I enjoy it. It's quick to do and nowhere near as hard as it looks.As ever, I made quite a few bags last year. I often make one of my Reversible Tote Bags to put presents in. They don't take long to make and it's fun choosing the fabrics.I also made two bags using remnants bought at my local scrap store Orinoco. The first one used some pieces of vintage barkcloth fabric and the second is made up of velvet squares from a sample book. I actually kept the velvet one for myself.I've still got lots of velvet squares left from the sample book so they might appear in this year's list of things made.What else? I've made some more Dorset Buttons and woven a few bookmarks and I've done a little bit of needlepoint. I enjoyed making this little pincushion kit in April ...... and I made two little needlepoint boxes with plastic canvas later in the year.I only made two quilts in 2023, even if one of them was the biggest quilt I've ever made. I'd like to make more this next year. I'm going to start with this aptly named pack of charm squares that I got for Christmas (thank-you Rose).The craft I've made most progress with over the last year though has been my 3D beading. ThreadABead have so many patterns that I want to make that I decided I needed to do more beading in order to speed up! So ... I finished the third building in the Christmas Village which is a barn for the reindeer ...... and then I made two (yes, two) more of the Father Christmas Houses, one each for my son and daughter. They have little boxes on the Christmas tree with tiny presents in and these were just the right size.Working the same pattern twice in a row really helped me concentrate on my technique (or lack of it) and, as well as getting quicker, I think I'm making less mistakes now too. I then decided to make these three Ornaments as Christmas presents which were a bit different as the patterns allow for a lot of creative decisions on the part of the beader. This was a challenge for me; I do enough creative thinking in my designing so I really prefer to be able to just follow a pattern when it comes to other crafts. I have to say though, I was really pleased with the results. One day, I shall make some more of these.I think  my next 3D beading project will either be an Easter pattern or this little Toadstool House; there are just too many to choose from.In 2024 I also want to do some more miniature building. Do you remember my little house?After finishing this more than two years ago, I've been slowly adding furniture. I'd like to finish it this year and perhaps start a new project. Petite Properties are launching a magazine focusing on small scale miniatures this year - that could be just the prompt I need to get building again.What about you? Does anybody else keep 'things made' lists? What are you hoping to make more of in 2024 - other than time, obviously. We could all do with more time to craft, couldn't we?"},
{"title": "Christmas Eve Eve", "date": "Saturday 23 December 2023", "text": "It's the day before Christmas Eve so that makes it Christmas Eve Eve - right? The presents are wrapped and hidden away until tomorrow evening when they can go under the tree. In the case of the cats' presents, they have to be hidden until the last moment or all the other presents will have been licked by the time we get to them (I make them catnip toys each year and, yes, I speak from experience).The advent calendars are nearly finished. Just one more chain to add to my crochet Advent Chain tomorrow.The last chunk of my advent jigsaw is going to take  a while I think. Look at that big space.I've already bought the two puzzles to turn into next year's advent jigsaws for my son and daughter. I found them in a charity shop for £2 each; I know how to spoil them, don't I?The decorations are up, although for a while these included that traditional favourite the mattress in the hall as my new bed and mattress were delivered last week.Luckily, one of my son's friends came round yesterday to help him move it up two flights of steep stairs to my new bedroom where it can stay until we can put the bed together after Christmas. Speaking of the bed, apart from the slats and the headboard, it all fitted into this box.Mmm ... doesn't seem very likely, does it? I shall report back once we get it open.I've been going through my list of all the things I've made this year and it's quite a mixture. I'm going to write a blog post about my lists of the year soon - oh yes, there are several - but I can say that I always start off my Christmas preparations in January by knitting the set of mini stockings that go on my Christmas presents. Here's my one of this year's, hanging on the tree; I make an extra one for myself if I remember.The problem with being so far ahead is that it leaves me feeling smug and I then forget to do anything else for months. Ah well, maybe I'll be more consistent next year. Actually, I have already designed next year's mini stocking and knitted two of them ... One of the things I really must do in 2024 is to sort out my various mini stocking patterns and get them all published properly.Anyway, I wish you all a very Merry Christmas and a peaceful and Happy New Year. I shall leave you with a few candles on my son's house warming quilt which regular readers are probably sick of the sight of."},
{"title": "Advent", "date": "Thursday 14 December 2023", "text": "I am a big fan of special things and this time of year gives me an excuse to factor in a little bit of special into every day. I am, of course, talking about advent calendars. This year there are four. First and foremost is the traditional card calendar with a picture behind every door.The highlight so far this year has been the fat robin on a branch, complete with a hat and his own little stocking and bauble hanging from his branch. You may just about be able to see him halfway up the calendar on the left.At the moment the calendar is propped up on my mantelpiece in the front room but, once all the doors are opened, it will be moved so that I can see the little quilt hiding behind it.You can see my little beaded houses at the side of the picture too. These are from ThreadABead's Christmas Village series which are beautiful designs, full of little details. So far I have made three of them.The Reindeer Barn in the middle is the most recent.A new addition to the advent calendar traditions this year has been the advent jigsaw. This was a brilliant idea of my daughter's. You choose a festive jigsaw (1,000 piece is best), make it and then divide it into 24 sections and put each section into a numbered envelope. Then you put the envelopes into a box and give it to someone (without the box so they don't know what the picture is) and they have a little bit of puzzle to do every day. It's a cheap way of making an advent calendar, especially if you can find a suitable puzzle in a charity shop.This year I made one each for my son and daughter, although I had to get them to help with dividing up each other's puzzle as that turned out to be too much for my Covid brain. Here's the one my daughter made me ...It's going quite well so far. Each day's section takes me about ten minutes or so to do and is just the right level of difficulty. I think we could well be doing advent jigsaws again next year.My third advent calendar is a crochet one. There's got to be one involving yarn, hasn't there? This is my Advent Chain, a simple crochet chain that buttons together to make a garland. I'm about half way through now and it's looking nice and colourful.I was thinking that an Easter version of this would be nice, in pastel colours, perhaps with a little picot edging?The last of my advent calendars is an advent candle. Well, actually, it's a night light in a lantern, one every day. I gave up on actual advent candles years ago as they were too stressful. Either I forgot about them and burned three days at once or ended up behind. This version is cheap and very forgiving to the confused and forgetful.I thought I'd take a photo of it from where I sit in the evening but this is what happened when I tried that.The pretty candle is on the hearth immediately behind Tolly (of course it is). So, here's a close up.I should have taken this picture when the fire was lit as it looks even nicer then but never mind. You'll have to imagine the fire.In between all my calendars I am managing to do a few other things. I'm wrapping presents, two a day and playing around with an idea for a 'stained glass' curtain for my front door. I did start a crochet table runner for one of the tables in my room of requirement (my craft room) but I'm not particularly enjoying doing it at the moment. I do like the colours though.And this is the table it's intended for. I'm planning to add a border to make it fit the top.I'm also proofreading what will probably be my last pattern before Christmas which I'm hoping to publish in the next couple of days. Don't get too excited. It's not colourful and it's quite tricky to knit. It does, however, qualify as Christmassy so that's something."},
{"title": "Candy Canes", "date": "Monday 11 December 2023", "text": "Today sees the publication of the last of my decorations for the little knitted Christmas Cheer wreath and I'm finishing off with something that I don't think I've ever eaten. As their name suggests, I think candy canes are an American, rather than English tradition. The look of them appeals to me though and they do add a nice, traditional touch to the wreath.For me, these sweets are forever associated with Laura Ingalls Wilder and her books telling the stories of her pioneer childhood in late nineteenth century America. I first read them with my Mum as they came out in paperback in this country; we were so excited when we found out that there was a whole series of them (I read Swallows and Amazons as a child but didn't know there were more, how sad is that?) Anyway, there are several references to Pa bringing home candy for Mary and Laura in the books but the best one is of course the story of the Christmas in Little House on the Prairie.These colour editions of the books are lovely. Not only do they add colour to Garth Williams' illustrations but there are extra illustrations too. Mary and Laura are worried that Father Christmas won't be able to get to them on Christmas Eve as the river is too high to cross and they go to bed sadly. But they reckon without Mr Edwards who walks miles to Independence to meet Father Christmas and collect their presents. As there is no snow he is, of course, on horseback. The girls are so excited when they find tin cups, pennies and little cakes in their stockings.'Then they plunged their hands into the stockings again. And theypulled out two long, long sticks of candy. It was peppermint candy,striped red and white.’As Laura says, \"There had never been such a Christmas\".I don't know what Laura would have made of my knitted candy canes but I hope you find time this Christmas to knit a few and perhaps find a stocking to put them in.Candy Canes"},
{"title": "Oranges", "date": "Saturday 9 December 2023", "text": "Oranges, satsumas, clementines, tangerines - whichever you like, juicy oranges are a necessity to counter all that rich food at Christmas. In my family the one non-negotiable part of the Christmas stocking is the little orange in the toe. My Granny was an exception; she loved big oranges and so, when she came to visit, she had a normal sized orange in her stocking.These little knitted oranges add a bit of colour to the Christmas Cheer wreath and don't take long to knit. It's harder than you think to find references to Christmas oranges in books but I have two to share with you.The first is another Shirley Hughes book, this time Out and About.This is a collection of seasonal poems about a Katie and her little brother Olly who first appeared in the wonderful Nursery Collection which we have as individual little books, sadly now out of print.You may be able to find secondhand copies of these or of the collected version The Nursery Collection which is more recent. I think that several of the poems are also in the The Shirley Hughes Treasury.Anyway, back to Out and About. The poem that caught my eye is 'Hoping' which in just a few lines conjures up all the magic of Christmas for small children. The accompanying illustrations are pitch perfect too.As well as the tangerines, there are mince pies, biscuits ... lots of lovely treats.My other choice is also a poem, this time from the classic Now We Are Six by A.A. Milne with illustrations by E.H. Shepard.Both this book and its companion When We Were Very Young should be in every home, with or without children. There are so many poems that you find yourself reciting for the rest of your life. there's 'Disobedience', featuring James James Morrison Morrison Weatherby George Dupree who 'took great care of his mother, though he was only three', 'The King's Breakfast' where the king tries very hard to get some butter for his bread or how about 'Lines and Squares' which explains just what will happen to you if you tread on the cracks in the pavement?But for a poem about Christmas that's hard to beat, there's 'King John's Christmas'. We learn right at the start that 'King John was not a good man, And no good friends had he,' but he still thinks it would be nice if Father Christmas brought him a stocking on Christmas morning. So, he writes a detailed list of all the things he would like and props it up by the chimney.Here are the things he asks for: crackers and candy, a box of chocolates ... \"I don't mind oranges, I do like nuts! And I SHOULD like a pocket-knife that really cuts' ... but what King John wants most of all is a 'big red india-rubber ball!' Sadly, his stocking is empty on Christmas morning but, in case you think this is a very sad poem, there's a twist at the end which leaves you smiling. My son who is a primary school teacher reads this poem to his class every Christmas.Oranges"},
{"title": "Snowflake Biscuits", "date": "Thursday 7 December 2023", "text": "The next things to decorate my Christmas Cheer wreath are some snowflake biscuits.These were the first things I thought of when I was choosing decorations for this Christmas food and drink wreath. There are lots of special biscuits associated with the festive season but I've loved the idea of these ever since first coming across them in this book.In Jolly Snow by Jane Hissey, the toys are tired of waiting for snow so decide to make their own in all sorts of creative (and messy) ways. While Bramwell Brown is baking, they make snowflakes out of paper ...... and feathers ... and have lots of fun. By this time it has actually started snowing outside but Bramwell Brown has also finished his baking and Jolly Tall (the giraffe, obviously) decides that this is the best snow of all. ‘Bramwell Brown came into the room carrying a huge plateful ofsnowflake biscuits. “I think what you need is some of mysnow,” he said.’ Whenever it snows I feel the need to bake some snowflake biscuits as I used to do when the children were small. In case you feel like trying these yourself, I found the little tubes of ready made icing very handy for adding the snowflakes.Snowflake Biscuits"},
{"title": "Mulled Drinks", "date": "Tuesday 5 December 2023", "text": "Whether it's mulled wine, cider or ale, a warm and spicy drink is a delicious part of the festive season. My personal favourite was mulled cider but Long Covid wouldn't mix well with alcohol so it's non-alcoholic mulled drinks for me now.The third set of decorations for my Christmas Cheer are some little bundles of cinnamon sticks with some spices embroidered on using french knots. These are very quick to knit as they're just ... well, knitted sticks.I knew the book I wanted to use to illustrate mulled drinks straight away, a picture book of one of my favourite parts of Kenneth Grahame's The Wind in the Willows.Mole's Christmas has beautiful illustrations by the artist Beverley Gooding. I see she illustrated two other picture books from The Wind in the Willows, The Open Road and Wayfarers All which would be worth looking for. All three books are now out of print.Anyway, as Christmas nears Mole grows homesick for his old home and he and Rat are there when they hear carol singers outside. The ever resourceful Rat invites them in to sit by the fire and goes off in search of beer to mull. \"I perceive this to be Old Burton,\" he remarked approvingly ... The very thing!\"‘soon every field-mouse was sipping and coughing and choking (for alittle mulled ale goes a long way) and wiping his eyes and laughingand forgetting he had ever been cold in all his life.’It makes you fell warm and cosy just to look at the pictures, doesn't it?Mulled Drinks"},
{"title": "Hot Chocolate", "date": "Sunday 3 December 2023", "text": "The second set of decorations to add to my Christmas Cheer wreath are three little mugs of hot chocolate.Who doesn't like a hot chocolate at Christmas (or any other time, come to that?) There's something about this drink that calms you amidst all the hustle and bustle. It's often used in children's books to represent home and comfort. Dumbledore suggests it to Ginny in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets when she returns from a terrible ordeal ...                \"Bed rest and perhaps a large, steaming mug of hot chocolate. I always                  find that cheers me up ...\"In The Polar Express written and illustrated by Chris Van Allsburg, the little boy who narrates the story is not sure if he still believes in Father Christmas when a strange train turns up on Christmas Eve and takes him on a magical adventure, along with lots of other children.At first, the boy finds the train a bit scary but everything changes when the children are given mugs of hot chocolate - 'We drank hot cocoa as thick and rich as melted chocolate bars.'The train is, of course, destined for the North pole where the children see Father Christmas and the elves getting ready to deliver the presents. Our narrator is asked to choose the first present of Christmas and it turns out to be a very special present indeed. Hot Chocolate"},
{"title": "Fairy Lights", "date": "Friday 1 December 2023", "text": "This is the first of six posts to complement the six sets of decorations on my Christmas Cheer wreath. I thought you might like to know more about the books that inspired me to choose each of them.So, the first decoration to go on this wreath is a string of fairy lights. These are such a traditional feature of Christmas decorations that I could have chosen lots of books to talk about here. In the end, I've chosen two of my favourites.Let's start with just one of the many wonderful books by Shirley Hughes. This one features Alfie and Annie Rose; the books with them in are woven tightly into my memories of when my two children were small.Alfie's Christmas includes all the excitement and preparation for Christmas that you'd expect. Alfie makes cards, does some baking and goes shopping to choose presents. The pictures of their newly decorated Christmas tree are magical.One of the things I like about Shirley Hughes' books is that she includes all the little messy details of family life and this book isn't without the over-excitement and tears that go with small children at Christmas time. You'll have to read the book to find out more.My other choice is less well known but an essential part of my Christmas reading. Meet Alpaca, the toy rabbit.Alpaca Saves Christmas, written by Rosemary Billam and illustrated by Vanessa Julian-Ottie was published in 1990 but is now out of print. If you can find a secondhand copy, it's a lovely story. Ellen and her little brother Robert are looking forward to Christmas and so, of course, is Alpaca. They hang their stockings on Christmas Eve and Ellen has made a little one especially for Alpaca.All doesn't go as planned though. Robert can't sleep and decides to go downstairs to wait for Father Christmas, taking Alpaca with him - \"I'd much rather stay in bed.\" thought Alpaca.' Robert bends down to switch on the fairy lights and drops Alpaca amongst the presents.Ellen comes down to persuade her little brother back upstairs and off they go, leaving the fairy lights on and Alpaca still under the tree. \"What about me?\" thought Alpaca.' And then Alpaca spots someone he recognises but it's been a long evening for Father Christmas and he falls asleep by the fire.And that is how Alpaca saves Christmas. Mind you, he keeps the story of his adventure to himself. I love this book.Fairy Lights"},
{"title": "Another Embroidery and some Festive Patterns", "date": "Monday 27 November 2023", "text": "After writing about my Mum's embroidery last time, I remembered another picture from the 1950s to show you. I found this one in an antique shop and, as you can see, it commemorates the Festival of Britain of 1951. It's an interesting design. On the left are pictures representing 1851 when the Great Exhibition was held, the modern equivalents are on the right. Of course, things that would have seemed very modern in 1951 now look dated to modern eyes.Near the top right is Battersea Power Station which was certainly a great advance on the windmill. I remember the power station still working but now Battersea is a shopping centre. I also like the horses ploughing on the left and what is now a very old tractor to the right. My Dad was a tractor driver in the 1950s and 60s;  I remember watching the harvest and thinking how nice it was they'd put his name on his tractor ... how was I to know that 'David Brown' was also a make of tractor?The embroidery is a bit stained and has been damp at some point. I must clean it and find it a frame; it deserves to be on display.I also wanted to tell you about a couple of Christmas patterns that I've managed to finish recently. The first one is a crochet version of paper chains where each chain buttons on to the next so that the colours can be swapped round. I've put this together as an advent calendar for myself and thought others might like to make one too.I wound 24 little balls of yarn, each with a matching button in the middle and wrapped them all in tissue paper. Then I added numbered tags so that I can make one chain a day during advent. If you'd like the pattern, it's available free on ravelry - Advent Chain. There aren't any photos of the finished chain as I've only made one so far to work out the pattern. I'll show you how it's coming along next month.As you can see, I also crocheted a drawstring bag to hold all those balls of yarn. Needless to say, this was much more complicated than the chains and took a while to make. I learnt how to crochet a nice cord though so that was fun. I think my favourite bit of this bag is probably the little crocheted snowballs on the ends of the cords. The pattern for the bag is published separately and would make a nice gift or project bag if you don't happen to have 24 tiny balls of yarn in need of a home.Advent Chain BagMy other festive pattern is yet another wreath. I think this might be the fifth one I've designed and it's the smallest of the lot, being only about 20 cm / 8\" wide. Despite that, it took me more than two years to design this one, my Long Covid kept getting in the way. So it's a great relief to have finally finished it.The decorations on Christmas Cheer are all inspired by festive food and drink. Well, apart from the fairy lights. I needed something to fill in the background and they added some colour to the design. The pattern for covering the wreath is available now; the six sets of decorations will be published on alternate days, starting on 1st December with those fairy lights. If I can get them written, there will also be a short blog post to accompany each pattern, talking about my inspiration for each of them.There's not much progress to report on my new bedroom as I'm now waiting for my bed and mattress to be made. They should be ready in a few weeks so I'm hoping to move in before Christmas. In the meantime, I've finished re-vamping the floor and have moved my desk and chair back in.It's actually my daughter's desk (an old double school desk I bought her years ago) but she says I can keep it for the time being. I also found some tiebacks for my new curtains. Did you know you can get magnetic ones now? Well, I didn't. What a clever idea.The other thing I've done is to work on the bedroom door which was chipped, dirty and battered from years of furniture moving and general living. Doesn't it look nice now?Would you believe, all I did was fill in the chips with a dark wood stain felt pen and then give it a polish with a dark beeswax? A bit of Brasso on the door knob and it looks beautiful. I'm very pleased with my 'new' door."},
{"title": "1950s Embroidery", "date": "Saturday 18 November 2023", "text": "I recently shared this embroidered picture worked by my Mum on my ravelry group and I thought it would be nice to have a look at some other embroidery from the 1950s.I think this dates from the 1950s when Mum was a young woman, although I haven't been able to track down the original pattern yet. I particularly like the little cat and the dog and the fact that it's two women. Somehow, it makes me think of the house we lived in when I was very small which had a steep hill behind it.Charity Down FarmOne of the needlework magazines of the time which often featured beautiful embroidered pictures was 'Needlewoman and Needlecraft' which was published for many years.There would be a free transfer for some simple motifs but, for the bigger items, you had to order the transfers. The earliest issue I have is number 2 from April 1941 (it was a quarterly magazine).This copy (found in an antique shop) still has the original list of people in the road to whom it was lent. Miss Beech had it first and then it was to passed on to eleven other friends and neighbours, changing hands every two or three days until finally returning to Miss Beech who kept it.I remember my Granny doing this with her neighbours. When money was tight, this was a good way of getting to read different magazines. As well as needlework, the magazine also had knitting and crochet patterns, as well as tatting sometimes. In this early issue, I'm rather taken by the embroidered knitting on this little jumper.The pages of the magazines were mostly black and whit but there is another colour spread in the middle of this one.Although it's applique, that house picture is in a similar style to the one Mum embroidered. I do have one piece of early applique that she did but, again, I don't know where the pattern came from.This alpine scene, worked in wools, needs a bit of a repair as moths have got to some of the colours.I gave this one to my daughter, along with a copy of the original pattern and the necessary colours of tapestry yarn so that she can either fill in the gaps or work a new one. This was the cover project on 'Needlewoman and Needlecraft' in July 1955.This next magazine, from April 1954,  has another beautiful picture on the cover.I love this collection of embroidered flowers, one of the transfers that could be ordered through the magazine; this one would have cost you 7d (that's just over half a shilling in old money or about 3p in new).The magazine also carried adverts for companies which would supply pre-printed fabric or kits for the designs too. Flowers were a very popular subject for embroidery. I have several pieces worked by my Mum, including this pretty little cloth.All of these embroideries could do with a wash and press ...This one is especially nice and I wish I could find the original pattern. I wonder what it was intended for?I would like to use this one in some way but haven't worked out how yet. It's made up of little squares, embroidered together. I wonder if Mum bought the marked squares as a set?The style of these strikes me as a sort of modern Jacobean embroidery as do these flowers from the same magazine.There are more nice patterns in this particular magazine. I like the stitch pattern on this jumper - pictured on yet another impossibly thin model. Mind you, the wartime rationing was still in force well into the 1950s.And who remembers these belts? When they came back into fashion in the 1970s I wore the one that Mum had worn twenty years earlier. Sadly, it wasn't a crocheted one though.This is the most exciting set of patterns for me though. Tiny embroideries to be made into brooches. You could order the brooch frames as well as the transfers through the magazine.I have a small collection of these, several of which were embroidered by Mum. Hers are the three on the left.I should like to collect more of these; aren't they pretty?I have one more finished embroidery of Mum's and it's a big Willow pattern one, measuring about 45 cm / 18\" across.I know that this one was from a copy of 'Woman's Own' magazine but I don't know the date. I think it would look good framed under glass or plastic as a small table top.I hope you've enjoyed this browse through 1950s embroidery. I'd love to hear of any old family embroideries that you have or can remember."},
{"title": "A New Quilt and a New Bedroom", "date": "Monday 13 November 2023", "text": "First of all, the new quilt doesn't go in the new bedroom. Actually, the new bedroom doesn't even have a bed but more of that later.As regular readers will know, my son moved into his new house earlier this year and I decided to make him a quilt to mark the occasion. He asked for one to go on the coffee table which he inherited from his Grandma which sounded like a good idea. Now this is quite a substantial coffee table - about 4' x 6' - and I normally only make small quilts but I didn't let that put me off. The planning was easy. I decided to make a rail fence quilt using lots of different colours and, in February, I sewed the first trial block.Simple to cut and easy to sew. I worked out that I needed 84 blocks all together so I set about cutting and piecing them, one colour group at a time. By March I had all the blocks done and pieced together - so far, so good.There was a bit of a delay while I hunted through my large stock of fabric for something big enough for the wide border ... and then I had to hunt again for some fabric for a narrow, inner border.I was a bit apprehensive about pinning such a big quilt but had a breakthrough when I thought of Mum hanging her big quilts from the bannisters to pin them. I didn't fancy doing that but it did give me the idea of putting my big square table in the middle of the room and letting the quilt hang from the sides of that. This worked a treat and gravity helped smooth out the creases.I worked out a simple quilting pattern made up of lines, curves and circles and set to work. You may or may not be able to make it out in this picture ...I think it's a bit clearer on the back. You can see how the lines come together to create circles (sort of).I really like watching the quilting appear; it's like the back stitch on a cross stitch picture, it turns a flat design into something with depth and texture. There is one slight drawback though - hand quilting takes a long time. And when you're making a big quilt, it takes a very long time.So  ... I quilted through the Spring and then had a few weeks break to make this quilt for a friend's birthday. This is only a mini quilt, the sort of thing I normally make. The pictures are some of her old family photos.Then it was back to quilting the big quilt. I quilted through the Summer and on into Autumn. By September I'd moved on to quilting that big border and I finished it on the 1st October.Then there was just the little matter of binding the quilt. Little? I'd decided to piece a scrappy binding which was just as well because I ended up needing six metres of it. I machine sew my bindings on to quilts and then hand stitch them down on the wrong side, something I normally see as a quick task at the end but this one took days (of course it did). Finally though, eight months after cutting the first strip of fabric, it was finished.I'm really pleased with it (and so is my son). I haven't got a photo of it on his table yet but here are a few  more taken here.You can see the scrappy binding in this one ...... and, of course, a quilt isn't finished until it's been labelled (something I could very rarely get my Mum to do with her quilts).That's the quilt accounted for. Now for the new bedroom. After the huge undertaking that was my new room of requirement (craft room) last year, this year's big house project is a new bedroom for me. With a lot of help, I am turning what was my daughter's old bedroom into mine. It's on the top floor of the house, next to my craft room so I'm gradually moving upwards. I wanted to sleep at the back of the house which is quieter and also has a lovely view across all the gardens which make up a big green space.The room has been used to store all sorts of stuff for ages, here are a few 'before' pictures.Piles of books, old photos and more than a few empty bookcases waiting to find somewhere to live. There's also a pile of my daughter's stuff waiting for her to move somewhere where she has room for it. More books, boxes and a spare bed. Do you see the dolls house with the red roof? My Mum and Dad gave me that for my seventh birthday, I re-furnished it and gave it to my daughter when she was four and now she's given it back to me (now that I've reached the age of nostalgia). I'm hoping to find room for it in my new bedroom and to bring it back to life. I've still got a few of the original furnishings back from when it was new.As you can imagine, it took us quite a while to empty the room (and yes, all the other rooms are a bit fuller now). Mind you, another huge pile of bags for the charity shops went out of the house, at some point the house must surely look a bit emptier?The first thing to do was the painting. I wanted to keep the original colours (yellow walls and dark pink woodwork) but it was all it a bit tatty and grubby so I gave it another couple of coats of paint. This was hard going, even though I only did one coat on one wall per day but I got it done in the end.When I'd finished the walls, my daughter came for the weekend and painted the ceiling for me and, between us, we trimmed some of the old shelves I put up years ago so that they fitted a bit better.The other thing we got done that weekend was to finish the new curtains for the room. I was fine at doing the sewing - again, a couple of seams a day - but my Long Covid brain can't cope with calculations so I didn't trust  myself when it came to all that measuring and cutting. My son helped me measure and cut the fabric so that the pattern matched and then my daughter helped me with the hemming. It's times like this when an old house shows its true colours. Big windows and uneven floors mean that you can't just hem both curtains to the same length; one has to be a bit longer than the other so that they're level with the floor. I chose a lovely, old-fashioned rose fabric for my new curtains. After the modern look of the room of requirement, this one is going to be pure 1960s Hampshire (told you I was nostalgic).Over this last week I've been re-varnishing the floor (and my hands) so that looks nice and new too. The next thing to do is to order my new bed (the old one is staying in the old bedroom as a spare bed). Unfortunately, choosing the bed involves numbers again so I'm having help with this too. I've decided to get a small double which is 4' rather than 4'6\" wide to take up less space but can't decide on which length to get. I've found a company who make custom sizes (including mattresses to fit) so I'm thinking of a slightly shorter bed too but don't know yet whether I'm going to get a 6' or a 5'9\" - decisions, decisions.I'm hoping to have the bed, my chest of drawers and my clothes rail (I don't think I've ever owned a wardrobe) in place by Christmas so that I can move up there. Then I can see what room I've got left up there for other pretty things ..."},
{"title": "If in doubt - label it", "date": "Thursday 21 September 2023", "text": "I think having an archivist daughter is starting to rub off on me. Having (sort of) finished my new room of requirement / craft room, it bothered me that it still wasn't quite right. Apart from obvious things like the lack of curtains (I want to make patchwork ones which means it's all very complicated), I was still having trouble finding things.  So, I spent several weeks working round the room, checking what was where, re-sorting if necessary and then adding lots and lots of labels. I started with the fabric store, just adding little printed labels to the bottom of each shelf so that I knew what was in each of the baskets.This immediately made me feel much happier. Even though I don't need to know what's in the baskets until I go to the them, just the fact that I can see the labels when I glance that way makes my brain feel much more comfortable. I was really surprised by how much difference those little labels made.Most of this fabric was inherited from my Mum who was a wonderful quilter. Hence this sign ...We were saying how the fabric shelves could be used like a free shop for either of the grandchildren to take stuff from as needed so my daughter made me this sign. Isn't it nice?I'm nothing like the quilter Mum was but I have been stretching myself this year by making the biggest quilt I've ever attempted. I normally only make small quilts but I wanted to make one for my son's coffee table in his new house. He inherited the table from his Grandma and it's a big one so the quilt needed to be big too. I'm pleased with how well I'm getting on with it; I had to use a hoop for the quilting which I hardly ever do but I'm nearing the end now. I'm quilting the border and then I just have to bind and label it.Anyway, back to the labelling. My big Knitting Kallax was already labelled so that just needed a quick tidy and clean in passing.In the corner next to it is my knitting bookcase which houses all my patterns - 17 files of them and that's not counting the Christmas specials - as well as some old knitting books and patterns (in the suitcases).That shelf full of files holds the 17 main files while the rest are either on the shelf above or on top of the bookcase. The collection of notebooks on the second shelf from the top is my hotchpotch of pattern notebooks where I scribble down notes as I work on designs. They are numbered in order but are really quite a mess. One day I'll add dates and things to the pages.Next to this bookcase is my little fireplace which still has my Rainbow Gnomes on the mantelpiece. I've added a lovely wooden magnetic puzzle from Myriad Toys that my son gave me years ago as I think it goes well with the gnomes.The wall opposite the big Kallax shelves is the window wall where I have two of my three tables. One is an old Regency card table which I can open up to make a big square table; this was very useful when I needed to pin Jack's quilt earlier this year. The other table is our old kitchen table with the top painted white.You can just about make out the Ten Stitch Rectangle on the card table, one of several samples I'm knitting for a pattern. Next to it is my very, very useful (and now tidy) craft trolley. I can really recommend this; it's sturdy, comes on wheels and you can get various attachments for it. The only extra I've added so far is that lid.I know, it looks like I've got curtains but these are just the old net curtains from my son's house tied to the curtain rail for the summer so that I could keep the worst of the heat out on hot days.  I use the big white table all the time; those granny squares are some of my samples from my How to Knit a Granny Square pattern. I came across them yesterday and thought I might have another play with them.On the other side of the white table is another set of cube storage. The tall 1 x 4 unit is from IKEA but the 2 x 3 unit next to it is from Habitat. Their 'Squares Plus' range is a perfect match for the IKEA Kallax (the 'plus' is important as they do a slightly smaller range too) - useful when you want a combination that IKEA don't do.You can't see the bottom row of cubes in this photo as they're hidden by the table but they're all full of WIPs. There are knitting and crochet projects as well as weaving and various needlecrafts - some I definitely will finish and some I'm not sure about. Before I labelled and sorted this unit, it was a real mess. Everything I didn't know where to put ended up stacked in those two empty cubes or piled on top. This photo was taken a couple of weeks ago and it's still tidy. Today there are just some flowers and a mini weaving loom on the top and an empty little basket underneath.The next two sets of shelves are the ones that took the longest to sort and label. These are two of the deep Billy bookcases from IKEA which house a huge mixture of craft supplies and books.The bottom shelves on both are taken up with quilting books and supplies (with my badge making machines tucked in behind them). The next shelf up on the left is for cross stitch while there's more quilting on the right hand bookcase, as well as my 3D beading stuff.  The third shelf up on the left is for weaving while hardanger, blackwork and needlepoint are on the right.It gets increasingly bitty as you go further up the shelves. From left to right on the third shelf from the top are loom knitting, my Sizzix machine and dies and weaving books. Then come the tatting supplies and embroidery. The next shelf up on the left has all my miniature making things; you can see the little house that I wrote about here a couple of years ago. Since then I have made some furniture for it but there's still more to do.On the right hand shelf are my button making supplies - I love making buttons - and then all the bits and bobs for toy making. The top shelves have felt, fimo, resin and lino printing things (have you noticed that I can't resist a new craft?) and then anything else that wouldn't fit is on top of the bookcases.For those of you still awake, you'll be glad to know we've nearly finished going round the room. The last bit of sorting and labelling was my desk drawers.I used to have what I loosely call papercraft supplies all over the place and they took up a surprising amount of space. Not any more. All sorted, labelled and put away.These are just a couple of the drawers. The boxes are smaller versions of the big IKEA  Kuggis boxes that I've used in other parts of the room. These are brilliant. They come with lids that double up as trays which is a real bonus and the different sizes can be stacked together too.Not all the desk drawers are full of little boxes. There are drawers of card and paper and one with my sketchbooks, pens and paints in too. It's amazing how much can be fitted into ten not especially big drawers.I have to say that having my craft things organised like this has made a huge difference to how I work but it's also meant that I'm doing different crafts again. I keep being tempted to make another button, work on my latest little beaded Christmas house or tat another gift tag. It's also really good to be able to tidy up properly. My Long Covid brain can't cope with muddle so being able to put things away is very important. As my Granny would have said \"a place for everything and everything in its place\".So yes, I am still able to make things as well as label my supplies. In recent months I've crocheted another Lazy Vee blanket for a new baby (baby Esther, born last month) ...... and knitted a re-worked version of my old Raggy Doll pattern for another, slightly older baby.This is one of the many patterns that I want to update with current yarns and much better instructions and pictures. I shall have to knit another doll to do that.Having crocheted the Lazy Vee blanket I was inspired to turn the same basic idea into a triangular shawl so that's waiting to be written up now. Like the blanket, it uses two colours in single row stripes but with no need to cut the yarn. The variegated yarn is King Cole Bramble DK, a yarn that I absolutely love working with. I used it in a different shade for Esther's blanket too.A little while ago I sewed a couple of Japanese knot bags, just to see how they worked. I had great trouble with the instructions that I found so worked out  my own way in the end. You thread the long handle through the short one and then the little bag can hang from your wrist.I saw some lovely versions online with flat bases but these would have made the sewing even trickier. Of course, this isn't true with knitting ...This will be my next published pattern. Two sizes of knot bags, knitted in fabric / linen stitch so they don't need lining and with flat bottoms, stiffened with plastic or buckram. They're knitted in the round until you get to the handles which have to be worked back and forth. Just so as you know, taking a photo of a bag on your own wrist is very very difficult.I hope you've enjoyed this little tour of my room and are inspired to add labels to everything you own! Next time I'll show you some 'before' pictures of the next room that we're working on. Oh yes, there's another one ..."},
{"title": "Houses", "date": "Friday 4 August 2023", "text": "For many months now I've been doggedly working on a little knitted house that doubles up as a box. I made the original cardboard model last year (or possibly the year before) but got no further than that for a long time.  Then, earlier this year I made myself start work on it, calling it 'Spring Cottage' in my pattern notebook. It took longer than I'd expected to finish so it's now called Summer Cottage.I must admit that I made things hard for myself by including two little dormer windows - just as hard to design as you might imagine - and two chimneys.The finishing touch is the abundance of flowers that decorate all the walls. I worried that I was getting a bit carried away as I added these but I'm pleased with the finished result. You can never have too many flowers can you?This was the first wall I decorated; lots and lots of french knots in four different shades to make a rose bush. There are several more roses on the cottage; they're my favourite flower. I was pleased with the hollyhocks on the other side wall too. These are made with crochet rings and a few straight stitches.And of course there had to be a cat sitting by the back door; you can just spot him in this picture.I had always intended this cottage to be based on the stone Cotswold cottages in my part of the world but, while I was working on it, my son bought his first house and parts of that sneaked into the design.Far from being a stone cottage, his house is one of many Victorian railway terraces built about 150 years ago to house the workers when the railway came to our town.This link with the railways is rather fitting as we have a long history of working on the railway in our family, starting with my Great-Grandfather and ending with my brother. Here is George (my Great-Grandfather) on the Winchester to Alton line around the start of the twentieth century.Jack's house has small rooms but they are very tall which is handy as it means he can fit in lots of tall bookcases. It also has some nice original features like the tiles in the hall and the stained glass over the front door.That front door was my inspiration for the knitted door on my little cottage; I basically copied the colour and all the fittings as well as I could.Downstairs he has a small front room with a kitchen at the back. This has a huge, original built in cupboard, very like the one in my house which is also a Victorian terrace. You can fit an awful lot of stores in this sort of cupboard. The stairs are boxed in, going up from the kitchen, right next to the back door. These sorts of stairs always remind me of those in my Granny's house and make me feel nostalgic.On the next floor is a bedroom and bathroom and then there are more steep, enclosed stairs leading up to the attic room.This is one of those wonderful little rooms with sloping ceilings, a huge, wide chimney breast and a little dormer window to the front. And yes, that's where the dormer windows on my knitted cottage came from.That's the chimney breast in the photo above and the little door in the wall below leads to the storage space under the eaves.This attic room has now become the games room and is lined with shelves of board games, with a table and chairs in the middle to play them on.As for the rest of house ... it's filled with books. There was already an alcove of fitted shelves in the front room that were just the right size for Jack's collection of Puffin First editions ...... and he's added shelves to the other alcove for more childrens' books, including his collection of picture books and then every other bit of spare wall space is lined with more bookcases.He's started putting up some of his pictures too. There's his Puffin Club poster in the front room which you probably can't see for the glare in the photo. By the way, see that coffee table? That's the one I'm making the quilt for. You'll be pleased to know that I'm on to quilting the borders now so the end is in sight.And here's another painting you can't see properly, a painted map of one of his Woodcraft camps.Above his mantelpiece we have hung the dragon quilt that his Grandmother made him. Mum was a very creative quilter; there is a beautiful castle quilted in the background of this quilt.Here's a close up of the quilt so you can see it a bit better ...And here is the label from the back of the quilt. Mum didn't often bother to sign her quilts but she did with this one.I've just realised that the backing fabric for this quilt is a partner to the one I've used for Jack's coffee table quilt. Mine is the same colours but with blue stripes rather than squares. Mum had long lengths of both fabrics and they turn up on several of her quilts. Here's the backing on my quilt ...... and here is the same backing fabric as on the dragon quilt on Mum's last, unfinished quilt.My daughter is having this one but first I have to pluck up the courage to finish quilting it. My quilting is nowhere near as good as Mum's.There's one more thing to show you from Jack's new house and it's either the worst or the best thing, depending on how you look at it.At the back of his tiny garden he has another house! Yes, really. This outbuilding is as old as the main house and, in its time, has been used as a workshop so it has electricity (not that you'd risk using it now), a big sash window and the original old stove.It also has a hole in the roof, a back wall that needs to be rebuilt, and lots of damp. But ... it's big and has lots and lots of potential. When he can afford it, Jack has plans to have it turned into a proper building which will give him at least one extra room. You'd never get planning permission for such a big building in a small space now but, as it's an original structure, it can be repaired. We think this is very exciting.Going back to knitted houses, I had originally planned to design a series of four cottages using the same basic shape, one for each season. Now, though, I'm tempted to make each one a different style of house. I'm thinking of a white thatched cottage for one and possibly a terraced house for another. I may use other family houses as my models too. I lived in two brick and flint houses as child and am particularly fond of them. Here's the one I remember ...This was a tied cottage in the village of Longstock where my Dad worked on a farm. The other house that I have especially fond memories of is my Granny's house which my Great Grandfather (he of the railway photo) had built for her when she married in the 1930s.It was a sort of half house; the downstairs was bigger than the upstairs. There were two living rooms, a kitchen and a tiny bathroom downstairs and two small bedrooms upstairs. Here my grandparents brought up four children. I've recently discovered that steep roofs like that are called 'cat slide' roofs for obvious reasons. That little window at the front is in the storage space in the eaves and could only be reached through half size doors from the bedrooms, accessible only to a child.One day I'll show you more photos from the gardens of this house; they had a big garden at the back where they grew roses and lots of vegetables and kept chickens, racing pigeons and, during the war, a goat. That's enough about houses for now though."},
{"title": "92 Colours", "date": "Tuesday 4 July 2023", "text": "Finally, I've managed to write up a pattern from my backlog of finished projects. This one holds the record for the most colours I've used in one pattern - all 92 solid shades of Stylecraft Special DK .Over the years of using this as my main yarn, I've collected all the colours and they're a great resource whenever it comes to designing a new pattern. They even have their own tower of baskets, each one colour coded with knitted stars.Anyway, I thought it would be fun to knit a scarf using every single one of the colours but I didn't want to darn in all those ends. This is why my Shade Card Scarf is knitted in the round; the tails of yarn can simply be knotted together and hidden inside the finished scarf.I couldn't bring myself to choose the colours completely at random - just a bit too scary - so, instead, I worked through them in alphabetical order by shade name. This resulted in some fun combinations and kept me interested as the scarf progressed. I'm pleased with how bright it turned out; it seems that the more colours you use, the better.If, by any chance, you don't have 92 shades of yarn, you can of course just use the basic pattern with whatever oddments of yarn you do have. Each stripe only took about 3g of yarn, a length of roughly 8 metres or 9 yards.I've been using my Stylecraft Special colour pegs to choose colours for designs for years now and they are starting to get a bit tatty.I thought it might be a good idea to have little samples in each of the colours to play with when designing so, while knitting my scarf, I also worked a little crochet penny in each of the colours too.These are small, textured crochet circles, a few inches in diameter which I think will be just right to give me an idea of how the colours go together. I can pull out some intense shades ...... some pastels ...... or perhaps a set of more subdued pastels with a vintage feel to them ...You get the idea. I also used the same pattern but thinner yarn to crochet a little thread mat for Pamela, my old Singer sewing machine. The original felt one was too small for the modern big reels of thread.If you'd like to crochet a little penny or two, this is what I did. I used a 3.5 mm hook with my DK weight yarn.Make 4ch and join with a slip stitch into a ring.Round 1:     3ch, 11tr into ring, join with a ss to the top of the 3 ch (12 sts).Round 2:     3ch, tr in same st, 2tr in every st, ss to top of 3ch (24 sts).Round 3:     1ch, (Frtr round next tr, 2dc in next st) x 12, ss to first Frtr (36 sts).Round 4:     1ch, working backwards, (miss 1 st, dc) x 18, fasten off and darn in tails.ss          slip stitchch         chaintr          treble (US dc)dc        double crochet (US sc)Frtr      front raised treble, treble worked round post of stitchMy Stylecraft pennies fit nicely into this old glass sweet jar that my daughter gave me.

{"title": "Making Stuff", "date": "Wednesday 21 June 2023", "text": "Nearly two months since I last wrote a blog post - I keep meaning to do it but then the extreme weariness that is one of the many delights of Long Covid stops me. So .... let's try again. I've sorted out a folder of photos, let's see if I can link them all up.I am still making things, mostly very slowly but it's surprising what you can achieve in tiny bits of time.  And I do mean tiny. I've been working on a 3D cottage shaped box for months now. It was originally going to be called 'Spring Cottage' but now will have to be 'Summer Cottage'. I'm determined not to have to turn it into an Autumn cottage though! I sat down to work on it yesterday, drew a few rough sketches of flowers for the walls and then had to give up - see what I mean?Anyway, these are probably the fiddliest, most aggravating things that I've knitted for a long time ... and I made two sets of them!These were Easter presents for my two grown up children and they were very pleased with them. If you don't know the Frog and Toad books by Arnold Lobel, you need to read them at once. The pattern for the knitted creatures came from Frog & Cast and is very true to the original illustrations. It's not a pattern for beginners though; there's lots of detailed shaping and the knitting is done on very small needles so it's hard work. Then there's the cutting holes for the eyes ... nerve-wracking every time. I am pleased with the finished animals though.Much easier to knit was this lovely dressed hedgehog from Knitted Animal Friends by Louise Crowther.This was a very well designed animal - I was particularly taken by the way the foot was shaped - and the clothes have lots of pretty detail. All the animals in the book are based on the same basic body shape so the clothes can be mixed and matched. My hedgehog, who was made for a friend's birthday present, is actually wearing the pig's clothes from the book.When I ordered the yarn for the hedgehog, I also ordered enough to knit myself this owl, although I haven't started work on him yet.I particularly like his lace up shoes and his duffle coat.  Louise has written other books, including another toy animal one, Knitted Wild Animal Friends which is very tempting.Having knitted the hedgehog, I then made a bag to put it in; presents are always nice in a homemade bag I think. This one was a mixture of vintage barkcloth, charity shop finds and buttons.On one of my occasional visits to Orinoco, our local scrapstore, I bought two sample books of velvet squares. They had very sticky metal stickers on each piece but, with the help of my trusty Sticky Stuff Remover (I was impressed that it worked on velvet), I ended up with lots and lots of velvet pieces.I used just a few of them to make myself this bag. Velvet is a a pain to sew but it turned out well.I've made two more bags for presents recently: this one to hold my Mother in law's birthday present ...... and this one to hold presents for a new baby (more of that later).I've lost count of how many tote bags I've made from this basic pattern over the years. If you'd like to make one (or lots) yourself, you can download the free pattern from the link under 'My Free Sewing Patterns' on the sidebar; it's the reversible tote bag.There's one present that I've been working on for months though and the end is still not in sight. This is the quilt for my son's (big) coffee table which is the biggest quilt I've made. It went quite quickly until I started the hand quilting but that is taking me ages. Never mind, I'll get there in the end. This picture was taken just before I started the quilting.Admittedly, it's not exactly the weather for hand quilting a large, heavy quilt. I also had a break from it to make this little quilt - much more my normal size - for the same friend I knitted the hedgehog for. It has old family photos on it which she gave me to scan years ago so I thought it was time I actually got round to turning them into a quilt. I enjoyed working on this.Now back to new baby knitting. I'd forgotten how quick it is to knit baby clothes which is just as well as lots of people seem to having babies at the moment. The bag with the animals on that I showed you earlier holds this set ...That's my Pippi Jacket, hat and bootie set, together with a Lazy Vee blanket and a Paddle Ball. These things are on their way to baby Lucas who is five days old now. His parents are friends of my son's; long time readers of this blog might remember me knitting these bride and groom bees for their wedding cake a few years ago. As soon as I'd finished making things for baby Lucas, I started again, this time for the baby of my daughter's friend (due in August). I've just finished another Pippi set.Now I'm about halfway through another blanket. Again, I'm using the Lazy Vee pattern but, this time, with King Cole Bramble DK for the contrast colour. I really love this yarn; I'm using the brightest shade, Loganberry and I'm really pleased with how it's working out.You need a yarn with a long colour run for this pattern; short ones just look too busy and you lose the effect of the stripes. As well as all these things, I do actually have finished stuff ready to write up and publish. Actually, there's a bit of a backlog. Normally, I'm quite quick to publish a new pattern but ... I've been writing up the pattern for this scarf for weeks (by which I mean I wrote a few pages last month and then forgot about it).It uses all 92 solid colours of Stylecraft Special DK but without having to sew in all the ends. I really must get back to that. This is another little scarf, well two actually, the idea being that you can knit several in different colours and wear them together. I need to take more photos before I can start writing this one up.The photos are holding me up with this very colourful crochet shawl pattern too.This is it blocking but, when I took the final set of photos, I couldn't be bothered to get my big lights out ... which means I've got to do them all over again. The yarn for this is a ball of Scheepjes Whirl in a shade with the wonderful name of Rosewater Cocktail. Isn't it pretty? Also, it matches my new velvet bag!So, am I getting on with all these patterns (or finishing some of my many unfinished projects)? Of course I'm not. I am however starting new ones. Firstly, I was tempted to design a Lazy Vee shawl, using the same technique as the baby blanket - one row stripes without cutting the yarn - this turned out to be much more complicated than I'd expected but I think I've cracked it now.The coloured yarn is Bramble again, this time a new (to me) shade called Victoria Plum; the main colour is white.Then, the other day, I got sidetracked by discovering African Flower crochet designs. So I played around for a while and came up with my own version, using some yarn I had in stock.I'm using cream for the flower centres and background, Hayfield Spirit DK in Sundown for the flowers and another shade of the same yarn, this time Casper to edge the hexagons. Of course I needed to crochet yet another blanket!I have actually managed to finish one blanket that I started years ago. This one is Tunisian Crochet and is a rainbow entrelac, worked in the round. I had terrible trouble crocheting the border as, because of the way it's constructed, the outside edges are actually on the bias (I think that was the problem anyway) which meant my crocheted border kept flaring dramatically. In the end, I reduced the number of stitches drastically and then gave it a very serious blocking.That's one of my WIPs finished but as I've started several more, I can't really say I'm winning!Meanwhile, I have been enjoying sitting in my garden. I haven't been well enough to do gardening this year as I did last summer but my son and daughter have rallied round, cutting the grass and dealing with the most invasive growth so that I can sit out there without worrying about it. Luckily, it is meant to be a wildlife friendly garden. At the moment, the bees are enjoying all the ox-eye daisies.And I'm enjoying my roses. You can never have too many roses in a garden and no, I don't have enough yet. This one is called Buff Beauty ...... and the rose we planted in a cage last year is growing well too.I don't know the name of this red one but, as normal, it's showing off, spreading its flowers all over the patio.What looks like  the paw of a dead cat is actually Linnet, relaxing in the sunshine. She is very laid back sometimes, considering she was very badly treated as a young cat. This was her indoors this morning, waiting for the rain to stop so she could go outside again.Meanwhile, Tolly cat likes to think of himself as a fearless hunter, stalking through the long grass but he's nothing of the sort. He likes me to be with him when he's in the garden, just in case a bee or a spider should suddenly frighten him.You can just see him in this photo too, guarding my pot of tea while I take a picture. A pot of tea in the garden is one of my favourite things.Speaking of which, I've been writing this for hours now and the sun has come back out so I think it's time to put the kettle on and get back out there. I hope you've enjoyed reading this."},
{"title": "A Magic Box and other Pretty Things", "date": "Sunday 30 April 2023", "text": "I've had a very exciting addition to my craft room recently. Want to see?Yes, I know, it doesn't look very exciting. It's basically a big black square with a handle on the top. Open it out though and you get ...... a big black cube. This is the Pixapro Light Box which I ordered from Essential Photo when it was reduced the other week. Obviously, other people had been eyeing it for a while too as it quickly went out of stock so I had to wait a few weeks for it to arrive. To put it together, you just unfold it - everything sticks together with velcro strips - it takes hardly any time and then you just slot in a background and you're ready to go. It gives you a nice white backdrop for photography which is so hard to get right.That's not all though. Did you notice the pocket with the cable in on the first picture? It has LED lights inside the top, operated by a dimmable switch.And yes, I did have to virtually crawl inside to take this photo.This is how bright the inside is with the light switched on to full brightness.This means that I can now take project pictures, however gloomy the day is. They still need the brightness adjusting digitally (my camera is pretty basic) but the quality of the photos is so much better. You don't get annoying shadows and the colours are spot on.If I open that square flap on the top (more velcro), I can also take photos from above. This is very useful for the many step by step photos I often need at the start of a project.Obviously, I had to test it out straight away. I've been waiting for the magic box before starting on a crochet shawl pattern using this very pretty yarn from Scheepjes called Whirl which is a blend of cotton and acrylic.I was a bit concerned that taking photos of small scraps of crochet on full zoom might not give good results but I needn't have worried. These two pictures are from the same photo, both on full zoom with the second being a cropped version of the first.Of course, it didn't take long for Tolly cat to discover this new, exciting place ...Needless to say, I've been removing cat hair from the backdrop ever since. I now keep the flaps closed when I'm not in the room. Not that he ventures up there without a human in attendance - he's not the bravest of cats. Meanwhile, Linnet still refuses to acknowledge the existence of the room. She will occasionally venture as far as the doorway to collect me if their food bowls have been empty for too long but that's about it. It's lovely to be able to take decent photos whenever I want to. In other news, my daughter was here last weekend and she helped me clear out my kitchen cupboards. Actually it was more of a case of her doing it while I did a bit of washing out of containers and answered simple questions like \"do you ever use this?\" and \"have you seen the best before date on this?\". The combination of change, nowhere to sit and a task involving more than one thing to do made me feel particularly ill; I wouldn't even have been able to start it on my own. By the end of the day my cupboards were transformed. Here's the big, built in one which no longer has heavy china where I can't reach it ...I can actually see what I'm low on now and I've even got room for some of the dishes and bowls I inherited from my Mum which have been languishing in boxes for years. I love this cupboard which was built with the house in the nineteenth century and holds lots of stuff. My neighbours have one just the same (the two houses were built as a pair) and my son has an even bigger one in his new house which was built around 1860 or so. His goes right up to the ceiling.I must write a blog post about his house which is very exciting. Anyway, we also tidied up my kitchen cabinet which is one of my favourite things in the room.I'm not a fan of fitted kitchens so this drop down table on the cabinet is one of the few work surfaces in the kitchen. My cutlery lives in those drawers and the cabinet also houses the all important tea making supplies. My son gave me the lego calendar a few years ago which is brilliant. You do have to re-make it at the start of each month though which leads to me being very confused if I forget to do it. In front of the calendar is my chicken stapler. What do you mean you don't have a chicken stapler? Needless to say, it is purely ornamental.For many years the little brown armchair that my mother-in-law upholstered has been living at the end of the kitchen. It was a daft place to put it really as it meant that anyone sitting there often ended up hidden by the open scullery door. So ... we (well, I watched) swapped it with the table so that it's now in the middle of the room.This simple shifting of a chair led to another burst of making things this week. First, I used some old barkcloth fabric from Orinoco to make a cushion cover, complete with buttons. It took twice as long to sew the buttons on as it did to make the cover. Another couple of photos to compare, this time the cushion photographed on the chair and then in my new magic box. As you can see, the colours are so much better when I use the light box.I've got enough of the fabric left to make a couple of little bags too. I regularly find treasures at Orinoco. I made this little pincushion from a needlepoint kit I found there; it was very compulsive stitching, I think I finished it in a week.Anyway, having made the cushion for the armchair, I then had a lovely time choosing colours to match it and crocheting a cover for my little milking stool that I uses as a table. Mats are always falling off it so I made this one to fit.I'm really pleased with how this turned out. At first I'd thought of just adding elastic to a big circle to hold it in place but then realised that it would be better to shape the crochet as I went along so that's what I did. The cover finishes on the underneath, just where the legs meet the top.One more photo before I go and this one isn't a pretty thing at all. Tolly cat managed to get something greasy all over his fur the other week (oil? something from a barbecue?) and he couldn't wash it off so he had to have several washes with actual detergent. He wasn't impressed.Let's hope he's learnt his lesson and will keep away from strange stuff in the future. I wouldn't count on it though."},
{"title": "Have Craft Room ...", "date": "Wednesday 12 April 2023", "text": "... will craft, obviously. It's so much easier to make things on the spur of the moment when you know where things are. Mind you, as I have yet to label most of my storage boxes, there's a fair bit of guessing that goes on too.At the weekend my son turned up with a charity shop bargain for me. A set of puzzle pieces that can be arranged and re-arranged to make all sorts of geometric patterns. What could be more appropriate for a designer? And it only cost £1. We were particularly entertained by the cover of the box which is somewhat bizarre.\"Go away, the great man is thinking\"I don't think this is an entirely accurate representation of celebrity night life in the 1970s but who knows?Anyway, the puzzle is great. The cards are double sided and there are lots of patterns to get you started. Here's the first one I made.Can't you just see this as a quilt or perhaps a blanket?I decided that I didn't need the tacky box though (not to mention the disintegrating plastic insert) so today I made a little black and white bag to hold the cards instead. Then I scanned the patterns on the leaflet from the box and printed them out on cards ... and then of course I had to make a little card wallet to put the cards in.I worked out how to sew drawstring bags like this in any size ages ago; it's a very useful thing to know and the bags are quick to make. Choosing the fabrics takes longer than the sewing (well it does for me anyway). I do like making things."},
{"title": "More Colour Pops", "date": "Friday 10 March 2023", "text": "I'm still enjoying exploring the possibilities of my Colour Pop technique which combines lots of colours and some serious texture, two of my favourite things. The first two patterns were purely decorative: a rainbow wall hanging ...... and a Christmas tree.Now I'm turning my thoughts to more practical applications of the technique, so my latest pattern is for chunky little purses.Roly-Poly Purses are beautifully tactile and very easy to make. You just knit a rectangle of colour pops and then gather the ends and add buttons to close it. I loved the simplicity of this project. Here's the knitted rectangle; the wrong side with its pretty lines will be the inside of the purse.I knitted three different widths of purses from the basic pattern, using the same colours for the pops but changing the background colour. These are going to be very useful for holding little crafty bits and bobs of which I have many.I think the next colour pop pattern will be a tea cosy. Those textured rolls would keep the heat in well.At the moment though I'm trying to get various projects finished that have been hanging around too  long. Do you remember my crochet Starburst blanket from last year? I had little balls of all the colours leftover when it was finished so I changed the mosaic design to a smaller star with lines, bought more black yarn and made a smaller version to use up the colours.As you can see, I've got as far as crocheting the squares together so I just need to add the border and give it a serious blocking - it's very lumpy and bumpy at the moment. I think it's going to be a bit small to count as a blanket but I may turn it into a little rug. I don't know what to call it though. Any ideas?I've just bought some new yarn for a crochet shawl too. This is Scheepjes Whirl which is a combination of cotton and acrylic and comes in a big cake of 1,000 metres of yarn. This colourway is called Rose water Cocktail. Isn't that a delicious name?Before starting on this, I've been playing around with new crochet stitches, courtesy of an ebook version of the Big Book of Crochet Stitches from the Martingale sale. Have a look, there are some real bargains there. The terminology is American so I have to concentrate a bit but it's definitely expanding my crochet knowledge.As I told you last time, I've also been using my new / old Singer sewing machine to make a quilt for my son's new house. It's to go over his coffee table which is, unfortunately for me, quite big so this is turning out to be a bigger quilt than I normally make. The top is finished now and I'm waiting for the wadding I ordered to arrive so that I can get started on the quilting."},
{"title": "Bit by Bit", "date": "Saturday 18 February 2023", "text": "It's been a while since I posted here. It's hard keeping up with things when you're always ill and it doesn't help that I haven't been able to sort out a place to take decent photos in my new room yet. I set up a rather haphazard arrangement yesterday which involved the cables from my big lights stretching across the room at knee height and, miraculously, I managed not to fall over once! So, here are some of the things I've been working on lately, a little bit at a time most days.First of all, I've been doing some English paper piecing with scraps from the two big baskets of scraps on the top landing (needless to say, both baskets are still full).I'm using pre-cut squares and honeycomb paper pieces from Sew & Quilt and, so far, I've tacked enough shapes to make 50 blocks. I've been better pleased with my stitching since discovering this extra fine thread by Gutermann which really makes the stitches invisible. I shall arrange the blocks like this so will need to add extra squares between the blocks later.One of the things that bothers me about doing so many crafts is that I never really make any progress with some of them. If I only practise them once or twice a year, there's always a lot of re-learning to do when I go back to them. This year I've decided to be more consistent so that I develop the muscle memory for some of my often neglected crafts.This is working well with Dorset button making. I am steadily working through this wonderful book by Gina Barrett which has detailed instructions for over 70 traditional buttons.As you can see, I've made eight so far so there's quite a way to go. Here's a close up of the first six.I'm trying the same approach with tatting but this is a much steeper learning curve. I'm trying to tat this motif over and over and then use the finished shapes as gift tags. As you can see though, my second attempt is worse than the first! More practice needed I think.The design is 'Christmas Rose' from the book New Tatting by Tomoko Morimoto which, I'm sorry to see, is now out of print. This was the book that re-sparked my interest in tatting although I would also recommend any of Mary Konior's wonderful books. Don't be put off by the black and white photos and the lack of diagrams, these are brilliant for beginners in particular. The prices that old copies of her books go for tells you something about how good they are but you can find them reasonably priced now and then. I recently found this one on World of Books for just over £6.The author helpfully marks patterns suitable for beginners with a dagger symbol so I obediently had a go at the first one in the book - an edging called 'Betsey's Downfall' (poor Betsey).That was easy. It's so small because I was using up a length of thread on a bobbin, not because I got bored. Even I have more staying power than that.I've been doing a bit of the next ongoing project every day since just before Christmas. Can you guess what's in this pretty tin?Appropriately enough, it's full to bursting with ... snowflakes.Every day I crochet another design from 100 Snowflakes to Crochet by Caitlin Sainio. Again, I fear this book might be out of print. When I first got the book several years ago, I started crocheting the snowflakes with thread as the author recommends but I didn't really like the result so, this time, I'm using Stylecraft Special DK and a 3.5 mm hook. They don't take long and I'm over half way through the book already and learning a lot about snowflakes on the way.What am I going to do with 100 quite large snowflakes you may ask? Good question, I haven't decided that yet. I am considering sewing them together into big panels to hang at my windows next Christmas although I suspect that it would be a case of 'that way madness lies'. In the meantime, don't they look nice?I have also been working on more Colour Pop knitting ideas. This is my technique for adding texture and colour to plain knitting which I have been exploring for a while now. You can see the Colour Pop patterns I've published so far here although I did experiment with the idea in a few early patterns too.At the moment I'm knitting Colour Pop squares for a baby blanket using some very pretty colours ..... and I've also finished a collection of Roly-Poly purses using  the same technique.I'm particularly pleased with these as they're just one rectangular piece with the sides gathered into circles and a few buttons added - nice and simple. I'm hoping to get the pattern written up soon.Have you ever considered using 92 different colours in a knitted scarf? Of course you haven't but this is what I'm doing here ...This is my shade card scarf which will have a stripe in all 92 of the solid shades of Stylecraft Special DK. I'm knitting it in the round, mostly so that I can knot the ends together and hide them inside. I may be daft but not so daft they I relish the thought of sewing in 184 tails of yarn.I'm not very good at doing 'random' when it comes to colour selection so I decided to knit the colours in alphabetic order (and why not?). What you see in the photo above is letters A - C. Adopting this approach throws up some very bizarre combinations but I think it will all turn out well in the end.I use my trusty Stylecraft Colour Pegs a lot when planning designs and they're starting to look a bit fuzzy and tatty now so I'm also crocheting these little circles to act as an alternative to the pegs.I was going to do just plain squares but they seemed a bit dull so decided on textured circles instead.I am still making progress with sorting all my piles of craft stuff on to shelves in my new room although I'm finding it slow going. It doesn't help that I think I've slipped another disc so lifting things is tricky - also moving, sitting, sleeping ...Anyway, this is the state of the big shelves so far.I've done cross stitch, needlepoint, embroidery, tatting, beading, toy making and I don't know what else but there's still quite a lot to go. Meanwhile, there are a few new additions to my desk. One is this pretty clock from Dunelm Mill which I'm rather pleased with.The other 'new' thing is actually 67 years old and I've had it for a while.This is a Singer 99, made in Scotland in 1956 which I've finally got cleaned, oiled and working. This was advertised as a 'portable' machine, despite being made of cast iron (guess how I hurt my back?) but, with a new foot pedal from Couling Sewing Machines, it sews beautifully. I'm planning to have a sewing machine on every floor of the house. This one on the top floor will mostly be used for patchwork, as will my Featherweight which lives in the scullery downstairs and is nice for sewing by the open back door in then Summer. That leaves my modern machine - yes, I do have one of those too - for the middle floor. That machine comes into its own for dressmaking, bag making etc. Also, you don't do yourself an injury moving it around!I have plans to keep the old Singer out all the time in my craft room but am hoping to move it off the desk, possibly to that little space to the left of the desk in this photo.Today I had a lovely time cutting out rectangles to start a new quilt for my son who has just bought his first house so that will be the first thing I make with this machine. I'll show you pictures once I've done more than cut out pieces."},
{"title": "Rainbow Gnomes", "date": "Wednesday 14 December 2022", "text": "A couple of weeks ago I had the bright idea of designing a little knitted gnome for Christmas. That'll be quick and easy I thought. Obviously, I was wrong. The actual designing took me a whole day which was far too long for me to work at one time and left me with a temperature again and a ridiculously bad night. I (well, actually my son and daughter) have now instituted a timer system where I set a timer for half an hour before doing something that I know makes me ill - anything requiring concentration, especially involving the computer.So ... I had knitted one little green gnome and was quite pleased with him.I think he has quite a lot of character, considering he's basically a pear shaped piece of knitting with a few added bits and bobs. He's a few inches tall and fits nicely in your hand.Of course, I couldn't stop there could I? I thought how much nicer it would be to have a whole set of brightly coloured gnomes so, after a lot of production line knitting, meet my parade of Rainbow Gnomes.I absolutely love these. I have resisted the temptation to decorate my new craft room for Christmas but don't the gnomes look nice lined up on the mantelpiece in there? Here they are, complete with the lights I've put in the grate.As normal, the pattern for the Rainbow Gnomes can be downloaded free from my ravelry store. The gnomes are worked in the round and stuffed as you go with a combination of bean bags and toy stuffing. The beard, nose and hat brim are knitted separately and sewn on and the whole thing is finished off with a little jingle bell on the top of the hat. There's still time to knit one for Christmas and I look forward to seeing lots of brightly coloured gnomes popping up online.Apart from the gnomes, I did manage to hang up one of my Christmas embroideries next to my new (as yet, empty) desk.Those short needles are the ones I use most. The pot they're in was painted by my Mum; there's a poppy on the other side too.The other decorations up there are these wonderful snowflakes on the door that my daughter's partner sent me when she came to visit at the weekend. He cuts the most incredible original designs each year.One particularly detailed one was designed with my two cats in mind as it features all the things they would like to catch.There are birds and fish and the wiggly things round the edge are feathers on a string (of course they are!) Aren't they wonderful?My timer is ticking down so I need to stop now. I haven't forgotten about the tour of the knitting shelves; I just need to take the photos on a day when it's not as dingy as it's been lately.In the meantime, have fun with some knitted gnomes."},
{"title": "Pretty Things", "date": "Wednesday 30 November 2022", "text": "Progress on my  new craft room has been rather slow for most of this month - a combination of me not being well enough to do much and waiting for my IKEA order to arrive. Actually, it was mostly waiting for everything to be in stock ... Anyway, I now have a house full of large, heavy boxes. Just room to walk down the hall (there are more boxes lining the back hall and another pile in the front room).To backtrack though ... while waiting for the furniture, I turned my mind to prettying things up a bit. Having evicted my sheet music from a tall set of basket shelves, it was moved upstairs to be home to my Stylecraft Special which, as many of you will know, is my basic go-to yarn when it comes to designing. The idea was to put a different colour in each of the baskets, a plan which turned out to be trickier than you'd think.There are yellowy greens, bluey greens, bluey purples ... you get the idea. I ended up with nine baskets of bright colours and two half boxes left over. These are going to hold the neutral and pastel shades with space on top for multiples (mostly for works in progress).Then of course I wanted colourful labels for the baskets and decided that the obvious thing was to knit them using the yarn itself.I used the six stitch stars from my Stacking Stars pattern and added a button to the middle of each. It took me longer to choose the buttons than the yarn (of course it did). The little red suitcase on the top of the baskets holds my Stylecraft colour pegs.It's been tricky planning designs with most of my yarn inaccessible so having the Stylecraft sorted has been a great help. At the moment I'm knitting a series of little rainbow coloured gnomes which I'm hoping to get published in time for Christmas.I made the mistake of designing and knitting this first one all in one day, something I used to do easily but which is definitely not a good idea now I'm ill. I kept thinking \"I'll just sort out this bit of shaping and then stop\", something I regretted when I was awake half the night with a temperature! I'm rather pleased with my little gnome though.As well as playing with my Stylecraft, I've also been painting the top of  my old kitchen table which had become rather tatty over the years.Doesn't it look nice? The plan is for this to be in the middle of the room but, at the moment, it's squeezed up against the fireplace so as to leave plenty of room for furniture building. Which leads me neatly on to the next pretty thing ...Two sets of LED lights with the white battery packs hidden behind scrunched up black bin bags. It was quite a fiddle to arrange them so that I could still get at the on / off switches but I'm really pleased with the effect. They make the room seem more cosy straight away; I can almost forget I'm wearing three jumpers to keep the cold at bay.While I think of it, do you remember me telling you about the old lamp that I restored earlier this year? It was one of my parents' wedding presents; you can read about its history in this post. They had it on top of my Mum's old workbox, made for her by her father out of old packing cases.Now that those basket shelves have been moved, there's room for the workbox and lamp in the front room. It lights up that corner beautifully.It's standing on a crochet mat I made when I was about 16 - yes, I was a very cool teenager - which is a bit stained; has anyone got any tips on cleaning it? I tried the gel version of Vanish on it but to no effect.I've got a couple more things to show you in the craft room, one small and the other not so small. The small thing is my new craft trolley from Hobbycraft.I'm very impressed with this. It's sturdy, easy to put together and has nice deep shelves. It's also very reasonably priced. You can buy all sorts of add-ons for it too but I'm resisting the temptation to do that until I know what will be most useful.The other thing I've achieved - just over the last week or so - is to fill that great big IKEA Kallax unit that my son and daughter moved upstairs for me. The arrival of piles of Kuggis boxes with my new furniture meant that I could finally start moving the rest of my knitting stuff into its new home.Excuse the blurry photo; I'd changed the focus setting on my camera inadvertently.These boxes are brilliant. They come in different sizes, all with set in lids so that you can stack them together; on the top of one of the big ones you can fit two medium sized ones or four small ones. I've also found that the lids can be used as trays - very handy. I think these are going to be really useful for all sorts of craft bits and bobs but, so far, I've been using them for yarn. Isn't that an exciting photo? If you like, I could do a shelf by shelf tour of it next time. Basically, the yarn that the moths like is in strong plastic zipped bags in the white boxes. I've also made little lavender sachets using mini organza bags to put in each bag as an added deterrent. The acrylic yarn is in the big baskets and the red fabric bins. The shelves also hold all my crochet books and hooks and quite a few of my knitting books. It was nice to be able to go through them and decide which ones needed to be where.You can see another new thing in that photo too, my new little white table. This is the smallest of the  IKEA Lack tables and cost all of £7! At the other side of the photo you can just see my yellow bag hanging on the door handle. Now that I regularly plod up and down two flights of steep stairs, this is essential for carrying all sorts of stuff so that I still have a hand free to hold on with. Carrying things makes me breathless, even if they're not heavy but it's better if they're in a bag. If I've got on to minutiae like my going upstairs bag, it's probably time to stop but I just want to show you one last thing. As you know, I've been enjoying decorating my bedroom mantelpiece each season with my seasonal cross stitch samplers at the centre. Yesterday, I laced and framed the last one but then realised that I couldn't get at any of the suitably wintry decorations to go with it. So, for the time being, it sits in glorious isolation on the craft room mantelpiece.Winter Sampler"},
{"title": "A Christmas Pattern", "date": "Tuesday 1 November 2022", "text": "Do you remember when I used to publish a series of festive patterns every December as a sort of advent calendar? Since being ill I haven't managed to do this (they're an awful lot of work) but ...Two years ago, I decided to knit myself a Christmas wreath, based on my Woodland Wreath but with a few different leaves and decorations. I had no intention of publishing it as a pattern but I've had so many people requesting it that, this year, I've puzzled over my very sketchy notes, done a bit of re-knitting and now it's all ready to go.The first pattern is available now on Ravelry and explains about the wreath I used and how to cover it with knitting. Then, in December, there will be five more patterns, each of which will have instructions for two sets of leaves or decorations. I haven't decided how to space out the publication of those patterns yet - one a day, every other day - what do you think? In other news (apologies for those who are getting bored with my endless craft room saga), lots of progress has been made. Having had two fit and able people here this weekend, the room now has actual furniture in it. Remember those 53 baskets full of fabric?They don't look quite so daunting now they're on shelves, do they? There are a few that didn't fit but I'm pleased with how many we got on to these two sets of shelves. If you look closely, you'll see that the baskets are labelled with tatty yellow post-its. I have plans to replace these with pretty labels at some point. In the meantime, I've added a few of Mum's angel ornaments.I made her the one with the long red hair and the other one is one of 'Sonia's angels', a friend Mum met at craft shows. She had several angels from her; here's another one ...While taking this photo, I took another one of the light switch which is just next to the shelves. Does anyone remember these?Yes, that's a Bakelite switch on a wooden mount. I have these in every room but, don't worry, it's modern wiring behind them. While I was faffing around with angels, my son and daughter were doing the heavy work. In case you were wondering, yes, it is possible to take apart a 5 x 5 Kallax unit, carry it up two flights of stairs and then re-assemble it.To be fair, they did have a willing helper in Tolly the cat. He often has that puzzled look; the world is a mystery to him.Tolly definitely knows the room exists now. No sooner had they moved in a comfortable chair for me, than he settled himself down.The other cat, Linnet, still hasn't found the room. She's a very suspicious cat and and is wary of anything new, just in case it turns out to be a portal to the vets.As well as these shelf units, they moved a table up from my bedroom and a set of basket shelves up from the front room. What with these and the table that's in pieces on the top landing waiting for me to sand and paint it, other rooms ended up with piles of stuff and nowhere to put it. So, after more bookcase moving, I now have things temporarily stored in the back room downstairs.Lots of this stuff is destined for the craft room once I have more storage but, in the meantime, I can still use this room. I've even got space for photography (hence the big lights). One of the joys of living in an old house is that there's barely a straight line in the place. Did I say joys? There wasn't a lot of joy when I made floor length curtains for the bay window in the front room - there's a six inch difference between one side and the other, calling for gradually lengthening hems. Anyway, look at these two bookcases ...They have to be propped up at one side so that the books and files don't fall over but, as you can see, the heights don't exactly match. And yes, those shelves are set the same distances  apart.We're now working on an IKEA order for a desk and lots more shelves. I've been having ideas for prettying up the new room too. How about patchwork curtains? I think I might know where I can lay my hands on some fabric!"},
{"title": "53 Baskets", "date": "Thursday 27 October 2022", "text": "I have finally finished decorating my new craft room - every surface has been painted or polished and even the floor has had a fresh coat of varnish.One of the messiest jobs was re-blacking and polishing the fireplace but it looks very smart now.I have tried and tired to work out what furniture to get for the room but just can't get my head found it. This sort of thinking is too complicated for my Covid brain. So ... I have done this ...Each of these pieces of folded sheets of newspaper, cut and stuck together, represents a different set of shelves or table or whatever. Some of them I already have and some are things that I could buy. My daughter is coming to help me this weekend and we're going to arrange them around the room in different combinations to help me see what will fit where.One of the things I need to store in this room is my Mum's large collection of quilting fabric. And when I say large ...This is just some of it, squeezed on to the top landing while I was still painting. It's taken me weeks and weeks to go through it all and decide what to keep and how to fit it into as many of Mum's baskets as possible. There has been an awful lot of folding and ironing. Which is where the title of this post comes in. This is what 53 baskets of fabric looks like.I keep telling myself that Mum fitted all this into a craft room less than half the size of mine but it does look an awful lot on the floor like that. There are baskets full of scraps on the top landing too; I'm going to cut these into useable shapes and strips gradually before they're allowed into the room.I have the two sets of shelves that Mum stored the baskets on and we're hoping to re-assemble them and get them in the room this weekend. Anything bigger than a small bookcase has to be taken apart to get it up my narrow staircases and then put back together again upstairs.The only other things in the room so far are two chairs. One is an old kitchen chair that must be over fifty years old; we certainly had it when I was little. As you can see, it's got somewhat paint spattered over the years; every so often I re-cover the seat with new fabric. The other one is my tatty old black office chair - very comfortable but not really me.So, armed with my trusty staple gun and two pieces of Mum's fabric, I turned them into pretty chairs, worthy of a new room.The back cushion on the office chair was very simple to do. I just used a metal paint scraper to poke all the excess fabric in between the two layer of the plastic frame. I started off with a big square of fabric and didn't even bother cutting it to shape.I'll report back once we've started putting furniture in the room. It will be nice to be able to actually use it eventually. The thing about creating a craft room is it doesn't leave you any time to actually do your crafts ..."},
{"title": "Making Progress Slowly", "date": "Wednesday 28 September 2022", "text": "I thought it was about time I showed you how I've been getting on with decorating my Room of Requirement or craft room. I've been working on it every day for well over a month now. Because of the extreme fatigue of Long Covid, I can only do a small amount of painting a day and that then wipes me out for the rest of the day, making everything else that much harder. Gradually, bit by bit, it's looking better though.This is what the room looked like when we'd cleared most of the furniture ... It's a big, rectangular room, right across the width of my Victorian terraced house. The fireplace is on one of the shorter walls and this shows the other side of the room.As you can see, it was painted red with the woodwork in a buttery cream. I wanted to paint it white to bring in the light as there's only one, not very big window. But first I had to deal with the holes in the very old walls. This bit was a particular favourite ...Before I filled this one, you could see through to the bricks. Once all that was done, I could start painting. As soon as I started on the ceiling, the original cream paint suddenly looked yellow. It's as if a heavy smoker had lived there for years - remember when all ceilings turned that colour?Painting the ceiling was particularly horrible as I had to do one coat on the whole thing at a time and it was very hard work. I had to keep sitting down to get my breath back and then couldn't really do anything for the rest of the day. I got it done though.The walls were more manageable as I could do one coat on one wall per day. Mind you, as you can imagine, it took a lot of coats to cover that red. This is what it looked like after the first coat on the long, window wall.Despite using a good quality paint from Brewers, it took four coats and weeks of painting to get the walls done. The room looked bigger and brighter though.After all that white, I was glad to move on to a bit of colour. I decided on a bright pastel blue for the skirting boards and door and, again, I split the painting up into small manageable sections. First I tackled the skirting boards, one coat on one side of the room per day. Several weeks later, they were done.It was at this point that I realised how much my work influences everything. When I was looking at the paint chart for the sort of blue I wanted, I had in mind something like the Stylecraft Special Aster, one of my favourite shades. Remembering this, I went and found a ball of Aster to compare it ...... who needs paint charts when you have yarn? Next was the door frame ...... and, finally, the door.This old door is seriously warped and, in all the time we've lived here, has never closed properly. It had long since lost its handle and we just shut it by pushing it until it stuck. It dawned on me that it might be time to do something about this so my builder, Paul, planed down the top and fitted a new handle. It's still warped but at least it shuts now (if you pull it hard) and the old push lock still works. These little locks are on lots of the doors and I'm rather fond of them. I need to touch up that black metal paint though.The window and radiator are going to be painted to match the walls and, at the moment, I'm working on the window. This, like all the windows at the front of the house is on its last legs, being held together with nails and over a century's worth of paint. I'm hoping they'll last a few more years, by which time I might be able to afford new ones. Custom made wooden sash windows don't come cheap. I can't say I'm enjoying painting this window. Apart from anything else, I find the noise from the traffic below makes my head hurt. It's not a particularly busy road and I'm at the top of a three storey house but I think my Covid brain finds it hard to block out unnecessary sounds. It'll be better once I'm on to the frame and can mostly keep the window closed.Meanwhile I've been having a major sort of all my craft stuff which, as you can imagine, is a huge task. Just sorting the yarn is taking ages and then there's all my Mum's quilting fabric ... My daughter came for the weekend recently and she and my son helped me with all the things I couldn't get at or which were too heavy for me. It's a lot easier sorting stuff when you don't have to actually move it around the house. Carrying things makes me breathless and so does walking upstairs.I'm gradually assembling piles of craft stuff and books - mostly on the middle floor - with post-it labels on top with the name of the craft. The plan is that it will be easier to choose storage furniture once I know exactly what I need to store. The trick with major sorting like this is just to concentrate on 'Keep, Not Keep?' to start with (Rose has threatened to have this tattooed on the back of my hand to remind me) and I've found it surprisingly easy to get rid of things.I've been keeping a tally and, so far, I have given away 158 craft books and 28 bags of mixed yarn and other craft stuff. Most of the books have gone to my local craft swap shop Orinoco, although Rose is selling some on ebay with all the proceeds going directly to the UK charity Blood Cancer. She started doing this with some of Mum's better quilt books that we didn't want. You can raise more money with harder to find books that way and it also means that they go to people who really want them. So far, we've raised over £100 like this* and books have gone to quilters from Poole to Orkney and lots of places in between. There are no ebay fees to pay if the money goes directly to charity.It's probably just as well that I'm not well enough to do the walking that I was managing earlier in the year as all this doesn't leave me much time for anything else. I have a queue of patterns waiting to be written up and lots of designs that are stalled. it doesn't help that, every time I want a pair of needles, I have to find them in a sorted pile.It looks like I'm finally going to be able to publish my Christmas Wreath pattern this year though.I knitted this just for myself two years ago, not intending to turn it into a pattern but then people kept asking for it ... I've had to do a certain amount of reverse engineering to work out how I knitted some of the things but I've managed to write up draft patterns without re-knitting the whole thing which was more than I could face. There will be six patterns in all: the first one deals with covering the wreath and each of the other five patterns will have instructions for two sets of decorations. It should be ready by the end of next month.This has also been ready to write up for weeks and weeks too ...This is my mosaic crochet blanket and I'm very excited about it. It's going to be a long pattern though with lots and lots of photos (and a chart once I've worked out whether it's going to be useful or not). I enjoyed making it so much that I've started on a smaller one, using up the left over colours from this one. I've adapted the original pattern to make smaller stars with a sort of Art Deco feel to them - I think that must be those framing lines.There's always another exciting project to start isn't there?* Rose has just added up how much we've raised so far and it's actually £183.28."},
{"title": "Autumn Bunting Pattern", "date": "Thursday 15 September 2022", "text": "After a glimpse of my new Autumn Bunting last time, you might like to know that I've got the pattern written up and published. You can download it for free on Ravelry. As normal, if you like it, I do encourage you to make a donation to the Children's Liver Disease Foundation, the charity that I support through my work. I started doing this back in 2008 and, over the years, knitters and crocheters around the world have helped me to raise over £25,000 for this very deserving cause. You can donate directly to the charity or via my fundraising page here.So ... would you like a closer look at the new pattern? Like my Spring Bunting, there are all sorts of details to find.It's a very long pattern - 24 pages - the proofreading alone took hours. What you get though is lots of little patterns: two sorts of flags, the knitted letters and then five decorations. These could be knitted separately and sewn on to scarves or hats or, in the case of the hedgehogs, used as toys or ornaments.I got a bit carried away with the hedgehogs and, as well as the slightly flat one used on the bunting (think road kill, only less kill and more mildly squashed), I included a pattern for a smaller hedgehog too so that you could make a family of fatter ones as little toys.I rather like the toadstool too. It's not easy to design something small and simple to knit that still looks like what it's meant to be. The trick with this design is not to make it too regular; it turns out that a leaning toadstool looks much more natural than a straight one.My favourite part of this pattern though has got to be the fox's head. This was the most challenging thing to design; in the end I built it up in knitted layers and then added embroidery to bring it to life.I hope people won't be put off by the embroidery; it's really not that difficult to do. Those fur-like little stitches around the edges of the knitted shapes make all the difference. Before I added them, it could just have easily been a deer's head.Anyway, I hope you enjoy this latest variation of my bunting patterns. Next year, when I've recovered from writing such a long pattern, I'm hoping to complete the set with some Summer and Winter themed bunting."},
{"title": "Autumn Mantelpiece", "date": "Saturday 3 September 2022", "text": "I like autumn. It always feels like a new beginning to me. Summer is all very well but, by September, it's starting to look a bit frayed round the edges and I'm ready for the deep colours of the new season.I've been enjoying decorating my bedroom mantelpiece to match the seasons this year, prompted by the series of cross stitch samplers that my daughter and I started stitching two years ago. I've just been through and added the label 'Sampler' to all the old blog posts that mention these samplers so, if you click on 'Sampler' under the list of categories on the sidebar, you can read all about them.Anyway, back to my autumn mantelpiece ...I think this is my favourite so far. Shall we have a closer look? I'm especially pleased with my new knitted bunting. I designed some Spring Bunting earlier this year and always had it in mind to knit versions for the other seasons too.The problem with hanging bunting made up of eleven flags like this is that it's very long - far too long for my chimney breast which is really where I wanted to put it. I ended up having to tape the picture hooks to the picture rail for the Spring Bunting and it still fell down eventually.So, after a re-think, I decided to split the new bunting into two lines and hang them together. All it took was a couple of lengths of thin dowel and some yarn to tie the dowels together.Next year I'm going to hang my Spring Bunting like this too. I'm in the middle of writing up the pattern for the new bunting (18 pages and counting) and I'll show it to you properly once I'm ready to publish it. And yes, next year I'm hoping to complete the set with bunting for summer and winter too.Back to my cross stitch sampler. The autumn designs were the first we stitched and I really like the finished picture. I'm particularly fond of the spider hanging from his web and that row of creatures and plants near the bottom.In front of the cross stitch are a few little ornaments. Two wooden toadstools, one carved for me by my daughter and a pair of knitted hedgehogs (from the Autumn Bunting pattern).On the other side is my conker made out of resin which I've had for years and a wooden vase of wooden flowers, bought from the Dansel Gallery in Abbotsbury on one of our holidays in Dorset.Next to the flowers is a little red squirrel cross stitch picture by my daughter. It's actually a birthday card, framed just as it was. One of the many lovely designs from Textile Heritage.And at the end of the mantelpiece is a glass picture of autumnal trees that my son brought back for me from the Lake District earlier this year.There's nothing on it saying who made it but I think it might be from Borrowdale Glass.At the other end of the mantelpiece is some of my lovely old Cottage Ware china. My late stepfather, Bob started me off with this by buying me the teapot and I'm gradually adding other pieces as I find them (or I was, until I became housebound). One day I'm going to design a cottage tea cosy to go over that teapot. This china brings back memories of my Granny's house when I was little as she had some of it. I remember sitting at her table playing with the fringe on the dark red chenille tablecloth. These were very common in the 1960s; Granny's was put on top of  a protective plastic covered cotton tablecloth which I think we called American cloth at the time. There was a white tablecloth too which I think went on top of the red one. Does anyone else remember tables being covered like this? I don't think it was just her."},
{"title": "Furzedown Gallery", "date": "Tuesday 23 August 2022", "text": "I've recently had a new order of the little cards I use as notelets and I thought you might like to see them.They are from Furzedown Gallery and are printed from original watercolours by the artist Kitty Herridge. Her subjects range from animals and flowers to dragons and gnomes - all set amongst beautiful countryside. You can buy the cards in various sizes but I always go for the smallest.Ten of this size card are £10 and postage is free within the UK. This time I bought two sets of ten, including a set of snowy ones which I thought would be appropriate to send during the winter. Here are the non snowy ones ...If you click on the picture above you can see the cards in more detail. Aren't they beautiful? I love them all; they're nostalgic without being too cute, if you know what I mean. As you can see, there are two cards with donkeys on. These will be sent to my daughter's partner who is particularly fond of donkeys. There is one called Clover who lives at Hackney City Farm, near where they live in London and, when he is well enough, they visit her and the other donkeys there.Clover is the donkey at the back of this photo.I haven't bought any of the snowy cards before; they'd make lovely Christmas cards, wouldn't they?Only one donkey in this batch but Hedwig makes an appearance. I especially like the one with the red tractor; the artist lives on her family farm and tractors often appear on the cards.I was pleased to discover that Furzedown Gallery is based on a farm of the same name near  Kings Somborne in Hampshire. As a child I lived in Longstock which is in the same part of the world. I went to school in Stockbridge and my Dad's family come from (and still live in) Broughton. It's particularly nice to be able to support and recommend a local artist.In other news, I have started painting what will be my new craft room, although I'm tempted to call it the Room of Requirement as it can whatever I need it to be. Also, the cats aren't entirely sure that it exists as the door has been kept closed for years. When I go up there, they think I've left the house (I know this because they tend to stay indoors when I'm out and only venture out to the garden once they know I'm back).Anyway, before being ill, I would have done a coat of paint on a room easily each day. Now I have to pace myself and can just manage one coat on one wall. So far, I've finished the ceiling and done the first coat on two of the walls.The ceiling only needed two coats, despite the fact that the colour I painted it before turned out to be much darker than I remembered.I suspect that those red walls will need three coats though. I shall get there in the end."},
{"title": "Tying up Loose Ends", "date": "Wednesday 10 August 2022", "text": "For my latest pattern, that's exactly what I've been doing - tying up loose ends. Please tell me I'm not the only one who regularly finds this when going in search of a particular colour of yarn ...My large collection of Stylecraft Special DK in particular, often ends up like this. At least it did until I took it firmly in hand and wound it all into cakes (but that's a story for another day).When I'm looking for a colour, I can never be bothered to tease out the ball I want and often resort to pulling a big chunk out and then cutting it off which, of course, leads to more mess and confusion further down the line.Anyway, I decided it was time to do something about this so I set to and untangled it all; I have 92 shades of this yarn so you can just imagine how long it took. I ended up with a pile of leftover lengths of yarn, most of which weighed less than 10g. Now normally I'd be tempted to throw these away as they'd be the ones that would unwind and tangle themselves up the easiest. There were an awful lot of them though.This little lot weighed 97g - that's nearly a whole ball of yarn - so I decided to make use of them. After lots of cutting and knotting lengths together, I ended up with this.This ball of loose ends used less than half of the yarn; isn't it pretty? I quickly learnt to wind the yarn into a ball as I went though. All those knots wrap themselves round each other, leaving you back where you started, untangling a mess.From that first ball of loose ends, I knitted this little pouch which is about 10 cm / 4\"². It's lined with fabric to hide all those knots which gives it a bit of body.My favourite thing about this little pouch though is that you can button it up in three different ways. There are four buttons and four buttonholes which can be buttoned straight as in the picture above, sideways to give you a humbug shape ...... or (and I really like this one), so that the top forms a cross on the top ...I know, I can never do things the obvious way, can I? Here's another photo showing the top of the pouch.Apart from liking it just because it's different, this way of buttoning leaves a little hole in the middle which is just right for your knitting yarn to come through while the ball is held safely in the pouch.Yes, that's a different pouch in that picture. I knitted three different sizes before I got bored; instructions for all three are in the pattern. As normal, you can download Loose Ends Pouches free of charge from my ravelry shop.I suspect that there will be more 'using up oddments of yarn' patterns coming from me in the future as I try to corral my stash into some sort of useable order. In the meantime, I've still got some of those original loose ends left to play with. What shall I make?"},
{"title": "Bigger and Better", "date": "Friday 5 August 2022", "text": "The snail-like progress towards having a craft room of my own continues. This past weekend Rose and I (mostly Rose) powered our way through a massive list of 'things to do so that I can move on to the painting stage', paying particular attention to things I can't manage on my own. There was a lot of filling holes; Rose did lots of little ones, like these round the window ...I only had one hole to fill but it was a big one ...A bit rough and ready but at least you can't see the brick wall through it now.We also painted the shed and Rose painted the high up bit of the back wall that I can't reach.I'm now wrestling with paint colour choices; luckily I can order that to be delivered as I can't walk very far again at the moment and definitely couldn't carry a tin of paint.The thinking and planning for what I want in the room is a continuous process. I want to upgrade the things that I use for work regularly so as to make the difficult things easier and more efficient. With this in mind, I have just bought some new, super-dooper giant blocking mats.For many years I've been using a set of children's play mats to block all  my knitting and crochet.They do the job and are easy to store but they're a bit thin and the letters have a nasty habit of falling out and getting lost. Also, the bright colours mean that I can't really use them as a background for photography which is a pain. My new mats are thick, white and huge; this is just one of them with the old ones on top.Look at those lovely square edges. The mats come with sets of edging strips so that you can use them right up to the edge.As you can see, there's plenty of room to block four squares at a time on just one mat and I've got eight more, enough for the biggest blanket. The mats came from Provenance Craft Co., an exciting new (to me) online shop and you can get them in various sets. I'm also trying their blocking pins which are made of black enamelled steel. Even the pretty little tin came from Provenance.The fact that the mats are thicker than most makes them easier to move around when linked together and I think you could stand them up too. With a bit of wadding pinned to them this could turn them into a quilt design wall. I joined four mats together to lay my mosaic crochet squares on when planning my colour layout but I shall need more mats once I've added the border.I'm very excited about this particular project. I'm crocheting the squares together now and, as I add each row, it's really coming to life."},
{"title": "Bramble Blanket and a New Room", "date": "Thursday 21 July 2022", "text": "Do you remember me raving about King Cole's Bramble yarn a little while ago? It's a lovely, variegated DK weight yarn that I've been working with a lot recently. As well as knitting and crocheting with it, I've found that it's also lovely to weave with.As I have all the shades of this yarn (of course I do), I decided to use six of them and weave 6\" squares on one  of my pin looms for yet another blanket. I wove eight squares with each colourway to give me a blanket roughly 3' x 4', not counting the border. For the crochet edging and the border I used my trusty Stylecraft Special DK in one of their newer colours, A Hint of Silver. This is the palest grey and complemented all the colours beautifully; I shall definitely be using it again.Now I'm not very good at random; I do like to have a bit of order when planning my colours. So, when it came to arranging the finished squares, I started off by trying to work out an ordered system ... then another one ... and then another ... until I finally gave in and just kept changing the squares round until it looked all right.Not a very good picture but at least you can see all the squares.I slip stitched the squares together, working through the back loops of the crochet edges with the squares held wrong sides together (try it and see) which gave me a nice flat join on the right side.The 'wrong' side looks nice too I think.As ever, working the border took ages - why do I always end up doing this sort of thing in a heatwave? - but I was pleased with it. I often finish blankets with a simple line of holes like this and end with a round of crab stitch.I love my new blanket. The woven squares make it nice and light and I just love all those colours.I have trouble finding homes in the house for all the blankets I love to make. At the moment this one is flung over the back of a random chair as I can't bear to pack it away but it's not exactly blanket weather.My house is even more chaotic than normal at the moment as I'm in the middle of a major re-organisation which involves building work, re-decoration and an awful lot of putting things in boxes. Basically, the things still in the two bedrooms on the top floor of my three storey house (which were the children's rooms) are going to be stored in one of the other rooms in the house so that I can turn one into my new bedroom and the other into a craft room. This is a logistic nightmare as we try to make enough space in one room so that I can paint it, meaning that everywhere else is crammed with stuff.First on the list (obviously) is what is going to be my craft room. I am so excited about this one. This is what it looks like at the moment.It may look cluttered but you should have seen it a few months ago.It's a big room but, as you can see, it's also painted red. It's a lovely colour but my craft room needs to be light and bright so it's got to be re-painted.There's just space in the room next door to squeeze in those big bookcases and the camp bed; the pile of Christmas decorations boxes in the corner are going up in the attic now that I have a proper new hatch and ladder.That door is the door of what will be the craft room.Any guesses on just how long it's going to take someone with Long Covid to paint a room this size? I shall work on it a little at a time; the joy is that I can just shut the door on it in between sessions. As the door has been kept shut on that room for years, the cats aren't entirely sure that it exists. They're going to be so excited when a whole new room suddenly appears on top of the house.The idea is to assemble all my different crafts and their tools and supplies in this one room, rather than dotting them all over the rest of the house. It's going to be wonderful, even if the thought of planning it is a bit daunting. So far I've decided on white storage - IKEA Kallax of course - and several tables. I'm also considering buying a new backdrop for my photography, one of those portable screens that roll up. I think I shall have to move things gradually, deciding on furniture as I go along.Just think - a whole craft room full of all the most exciting things I own. I may never come downstairs again."},
{"title": "Little Looms Magazine", "date": "Thursday 7 July 2022", "text": "I've been reading Easy Weaving With Little Looms magazine ever since the first issue in 2016. The mixture of small looms catered for, from pin looms to inkle to rigid heddle really appeals to me. Having said that, I haven't actually felt the need to make any of the projects in the magazines yet - there are only so many scarves you can weave and I didn't feel that most of the patterns offered me anything new.This has all changed with the latest issue which came out towards the end of last week. I have a digital subscription which is very good value, as well as giving you access to all past issues of the magazine online. It also means that you get the new issue (as a pdf) as soon as it's published. As soon as I saw the cover, I knew this one was going to be good.Now pin looms are sometimes seen as a bit of a poor relation in the family of weaving looms - I have no idea why as they're incredibly versatile, portable and all round wonderful. Anyway, with the Cathedral Window blanket by Gabi van Tassell of Turtle Looms on the cover, I think it's safe to say that these little looms are here to stay.I've written about my love for pin looms several times on this blog; if you click on 'weaving' in the word cloud on the right, you can read all about my growing collection of these little looms. As well as my turtle looms, I'm also a big fan of Hazel Rose's looms, both the weavette style ones and those where you weave on the bias. At the moment I'm enjoying weaving a baby blanket with my new, fine sett tiny weaver looms. And then both Hazel and Gabi keep bringing out new looms and I want them all! Well, the fine sett ones anyway.To get back to the blanket on the cover of the magazine ... I was immediately inspired by all the different ways you could use these particular looms. Lucy Boston's Patchwork of the Crosses immediately sprang to mind but you could fit them together in all sorts of ways. Then I started thinking of combining other shapes like this, edged with black ... where's my graph paper? Stained glass and little looms seem to me like a perfect combination.As I read through the magazine I found that this issue was full of ideas and projects that, while exciting in themselves, also sparked lots of ideas for future weaving. Instead of 'inwards facing' projects where it's easy to be put off because you don't like the colours chosen or don't have the size of loom used, everything in this magazine faced 'outwards' - yes, giving you a project but also featuring little tricks and techniques that you could use in all sorts of other ways too. By the time I was half way through, I couldn't wait to get my looms out and play.Before I show you what I've done so far, here are the projects in the magazine ...... all sorts of looms and all sorts of things to make, from wearables to things for the home or toys. Best of all, each project uses interesting and often new techniques.  You can see some better pictures of the projects here. I particularly liked the catenpile technique of adding surface decoration to your weaving, developed by Jessica Lambert; I really want to try that.The project that got me crafting straight away though was this one ...Alison Irwin's 'Not so plain after all' bag is described as an inkle loom project but, really, it's more of a 'look how many techniques I used to make one little bag'  article. That rainbow band across the top is inkle woven but there's also plain weave, pattern darning effects and braids. It was the rainbow braids that caught my eye - lots of different patterns all using black and one bright colour. This I had to try.The originals were woven with embroidery threads and finished with little beaded rings but I just grabbed some DK weight yarn and went to look for my Kumihimo book.This book by Helen Deighan is a wonderful introduction to braid weaving; all you need is a foam disc and some yarn and you're ready to go. You can even try the technique with a card loom you can make yourself. Search online to find templates (or buy the book, it's really good). I found the page on sixteen thread braids and realised that all eight of the braids pictured in the article were woven in exactly the same way, it's only the original set up of the colours that changes. How exciting is that? Here are my eight little braids which I'm going to keep as reference samples so that I know how to create each of the colour patterns.I particularly like the squares and diamonds (green and yellow) and the one that looks like a spiral zip (orange). Aren't they fun?I really liked the rainbow inkle band in this project too and, luckily, I've finally worked out how inkle looms work so I might actually be able to buy one. I bought Anne Dixon's Inkle Pattern Directory years ago and, after poring over all the colourful patterns, got completely put off by failing to grasp the basics of inkle weaving in the introduction. On one of my recent wakeful nights (one of the many joys of Long Covid) I fished out the book and set myself to read and re-read the few paragraphs until it finally clicked - I can even follow the weaving drafts now. Also, I'd like to have a go at tablet weaving and an inkle loom would be ideal for that ...Anyway, enough about that. The other project that I had to make straight away was this one ...A pin loom llama, designed by Margaret Stump who specialises in making all sorts of wonderful creatures out of a few simple looms. Have a look at her blog Pin Loom Weaving and you'll see what I mean. To make this llama you only need 2\" and 4\" square looms (there are some 2 x 4\" rectangles but you can just join two smaller squares to make those). So, off I went and, several days later, I had my own llama.I used two strands of grey alpaca DK weight yarn held together for his body parts and random colours of DK yarn used single for his clothes. As you can see, I knitted him a colourful blanket too. Having decided I wanted him to have arms but having nearly run out of the alpaca yarn, I combined it with a light grey acrylic which was a good match - it just means his arms are a bit less soft than the rest of him.I learnt a lot making this lovely animal, mostly about how to turn squares and rectangles into whatever shape you want. it's actually much the same sort of idea as I use in some of my knitting patterns; I often turn little rough squares into circles with a bit of tucking and gathering. I'm very tempted to make some other animals of my own now which I think is always the sign of a good design, not only does it work on its own but it shows you how to use it as a starting point for your own ideas.I think the next thing on my list will be some tapestry weaving, inspired by this article on weaving angled shapes. I hope I've inspired you to have a look at this exciting magazine; the things I've shown you are just a small part of the whole thing. It's one of a collection of really good magazines from Long Thread Media, including the classic Piecework which I also subscribe to. I've been working through the back catalogue of their podcast recently too and am thoroughly enjoying it. Are any of you little loom fans like me? If not and you're intrigued, a good place to find out more is the Looms to Go group on ravlery - see you there!"},
{"title": "Pretty Pots", "date": "Friday 17 June 2022", "text": "That's the name of my new pattern - Pretty Pots - the latest in quite a few patterns for containers lined with plastic canvas. My Square and Round Nesting Boxes use simple shapes, an understated stitch pattern and plain colours for effect.With this pattern, I've used a much thicker variegated yarn and the stitch pattern gives added texture too.The inspiration for this design came from a lovely ball of chunky yarn that I found in Dunelm Mill (I always have trouble saying that out loud).Hayfield Spirit Chunky (155 m / 100g) is a variegated yarn that comes in some lovely colours; the one I chose was shade 408, Sundown but there are lots of others. Now I don't normally work with thick yarn but I thought it would be a new experience for me and I have to say it turned out to be a lot of fun. Once I'd got the idea of seeing how many different pots I could knit with this one ball of yarn, there was no stopping me. Mind you, things were a bit tense when I was working on the last and biggest pot; I ended up with just a few metres of yarn left.As you can see, I used contrasting yarns for the inside of the pots. As well as looking good, this meant that the chunky yarn went further. Both the outside and inside of the pots are knitted in the round and the bases have a pleasing spiral pattern.I have a tendency to add buttons to things whenever possible and this pattern was no exception. Each of the pots has a button in the middle of its base, although I have to admit that this makes the tall, thin pot a bit unstable.The sizes of the three pots are fairly random. There are three small ones which I've filled with knitting and crochet stuff (I love my Clover Amour crochet hooks - fantastic to use and colourful too).Then there are two medium pots and one big one which is wide but shallow (owing to the whole running out of yarn thing). Here are the medium ones.All the pots are lined with plastic canvas so they're sturdy and keep their shape well. As I say, I planned the sizes at random so was rather pleased to see how some of them fitted together. I think this combination would make a nice gift (it's the large pot, the smaller of the two medium ones and the middle one of the smallest size).I hope you enjoy this pattern. I look forward to seeing picture of lots more pretty pots.Pretty PotsNot long after finishing these I discovered that there's a DK version of this yarn. Bet you can guess what's coming next ...I went for some autumnal colours this time; this is Casper and, having enjoyed seeing how much I could knit with one ball of yarn, I thought I'd repeat the exercise but this time knitting little pouches and purses. I haven't actually started knitting yet but I have had a few ideas so watch this space."},
{"title": "Going to the Library", "date": "Thursday 9 June 2022", "text": "I've always liked libraries. When I was little a mobile library used to come to our village and I remember climbing the steps up to it and being very excited about choosing books. Then, when we moved into town, the library was the first place I was allowed to walk to on my own - after a re-run of my Mum's \"what do you do if a strange man asks you if you'd like to see some kittens?\" talk (she knew me well). It wasn't long before I'd exhausted the possibilities of the children's library but they wouldn't let me use my library card in the adult library. So my Mum gave me her card to use instead; they didn't like it but couldn't work out a way to stop us.Anyway, after two years of being housebound with Long Covid, the library was the first proper outing I managed on my own and I go there regularly now. It's a good place for me to cope with as it's nice and quiet, not too many people and no loud music or noises. And I still get excited about being able to choose books and take them home with me.I have to limit what I borrow as carrying too much makes me breathless and reading itself is very tiring now. So I tend to get books that are picture heavy so that, if I can't managed anything else, at least I can look at the pretty pictures. A few weeks ago, I borrowed this one ...I thought it looked fun and I have yet to find a craft that I don't like. Look at all that pretty weaving on the back cover.The author recommends perle cotton no. 5 for the bracelets but the nearest I had was no. 8 so I had a go with that.It reminded me of making macrame plant holders back in the early 1980s with my Mum; I suppose it's really the same thing, just on a smaller scale. I got better at it as I went along but wasn't particularly enamoured with the result. Then I thought of trying the same pattern with some knitting cotton.I enjoyed this much more; you can see the texture of the knots at this scale which I really like. Here's the finished bracelet.Apparently, you're meant to tie them on a friend's wrist and then they leave them there until they fall apart. a) I didn't want to give my bracelet away and b) what about washing? Luckily, the finished band is stretchy so I can knot it together like this and still slip it on and off.There are lots more patterns in this book so I may have to borrow it again ... or add it to the list of craft books I'd like one day. As you can imagine, this is a substantial list.I particularly like the one that looks like it's made up of woven ribbons.I changed my library books yesterday. This is what I chose ...... a craft book, a plant book and a history book. Those should keep me busy for a while. Before I go, you might like to see my newly strengthened garden wall. It's nice not to worry about it falling on me (or one of the cats) when the wind blows.Paul the builder dug up a treasure for me when he was setting one of those posts in place and I've been excitedly showing it to everyone ever since.It's a very long, very old nail that would have been handmade by a blacksmith, hammering it into shape. Isn't it wonderful? This house was built in the mid 1890s so I don't know if it dates from then or earlier, when the land would have been agricultural. The house walls at the back of the house near where it was found are single brick so it seems a bit long but who knows? It's my new favourite thing."},
{"title": "Summer Mantelpiece", "date": "Thursday 2 June 2022", "text": "It's been decidedly un-summery weather here lately but it's the start of June so I decided it was time to decorate my Summer mantelpiece.I know, that windmill looks ridiculously out of proportion but I couldn't resist it. I do love my windmills. I had to suspend it from the picture rail (picture rails are so useful) to get it to stay there.Pride of place, as before, goes to my cross stitch sampler, Summer Blooms. I'm framing my samplers as I go along this year; next year I shall just have to swap them over.What else is on the mantelpiece? Bits and bobs and lots of yellow. There was a lot of yellow on my Spring mantelpiece too; it's my favourite colour. I do like my craft tools to be pretty. Here we have my set of colourful Tunisian crochet hooks and my normal Clover Amour hooks. Each size is a different colour which makes it easy to grab the one you want and they are so comfortable to use. I'm currently using the pink one to crochet these squares ...... and the orange and yellow ones have come in very handy for weaving samples on my new Fine Sett Tiny Weaver Looms from Hazel Rose Looms.The knitted pot holding the crochet hooks is one of a set called 'Pretty Pots' (obviously), all knitted with one 100g ball of chunky yarn and various colours of DK for the linings. I've been writing the pattern up for nearly two weeks and I still haven't finished the first draft. Before being ill, I could probably have written it in a day or two. In my defence though, there are a lot of tables and drawing up tables makes my head hurt.Back to the mantelpiece. Next to the crochet hooks are two of my very favourite things, both of which used to be my Mum's.These little dishes were made by Jo Lester from Studio Pottery on the Isle of Wight and Mum bought them on one of our first holidays as a family back in the early 1960s. My earliest memory is of being carried up open steps into a little house amongst trees which I later found out would have been the caravan we stayed in. You can see my pushchair folded up, underneath the caravan.Mum always had these dishes on display and there were such a familiar part of home as I was growing up.Further along the mantelpiece there are some more recent ornaments, both associated with my daughter.I bought the lambanana - and yes, that is a thing - when I went to stay with Rose in Liverpool when she was doing her Archivist training at the University there. It's a wonderful city. She made me the felt knitting cat too, although I did give her the kit, together with a very broad hint that I might like the finished thing! I collected the little white shells on holiday in Weymouth with my late Stepfather.We've got to the other end of the mantelpiece now and yet more yellow things.The china is some of my Mum and Dad's wedding china from the 1950s ... or it may be some that I've bought in recent years. I tend to pick up matching pieces whenever I see it. Again, this is closely tied up with memories of home as a child. Here it is being used at my seventh birthday party.I'm the one on the right in the headband and I would appear to be singing 'Happy Birthday' to myself.And last but not least we have my little yellow duck. He's not just a common or garden duck though but was once one of the stars of a Radio 4 programme called Invasion of the Yellow Ducks. This tells the story of how a container of toy ducks, washed off the deck of a ship during a storm helped to chart the movement of the oceans. As well as this programme in which my duck and his friends got to bob around for a bit in - I think - the sea off Southampton, this real life story also inspired a book by Donovan Hohn called Moby-Duck and several picture books including  Ducks Overboard! by Markus Motum. My duck is now living in quiet retirement, complete with knitted shawl."},

{"title": "Fresh Air", "date": "Wednesday 11 May 2022", "text": "I learnt a lot from reading The Secret Garden as the child. For a start, it's the best introduction to gardening you can find anywhere. Mary knows nothing about gardening when she discovers the overgrown garden, she clears space for the plants to grow and is rewarded with flowers. The childrens' enthusiasm for the natural world is infectious and stays with you for years. It's also a great example of the physical and psychological benefits of fresh air and exercise - add in the creativity of making a garden and you've got everything you need for happiness.Here's Mary, when she first starts to run outdoors, just to keep warm ...'the big breaths of fresh air blown over the heather filled her lungs with something which was good for her whole thin body and whipped some red colour into her cheeks and brightened her dull eyes when she did not know anything about it'Suffice to say, I'm a great believer in fresh air. This has been something of a problem since I've been ill. For the last two years, the long country walks that were a regular part of my life have not been possible and I miss them, probably more than anything else. I can now walk a bit further than before, as long as I take regular rests and don't carry anything heavy. This meant that, at the end of March, to mark Mother's Day, my son and I managed a proper walk and picnic.We couldn't get as far as actual countryside* but we walked a little way along the canal and met this heron on the way.We were just starting to think he was a plastic heron when he lumbered into the air and flew away. We came back through Spiceball Park which is a big park right in the middle of Banbury, between the canal and the river. Sitting on a bench by the river for me to catch my breath, we spotted a kingfisher skimming along above the water. As they keep to the same stretch of river, I shall now look out for it every time I go there.Walks aside though, I am very lucky to have a garden and spend as much time in it as I can. It's one of those long, thin gardens, typical of Victorian terraced houses and backs on to lots of similar sized ones so the whole thing creates a huge green area with lots of trees and wildlife. Here's the view looking up the garden ...... and this is what it looks like from the top, facing towards the house ...It looks wider than it is in real life. If you look at the houses, mine goes from the windows to the left of the small white building (my kitchen and scullery) to the chimney pots above it. As with all gardens, it's a work in progress and full of mess and memories. As you can see, I have a fine crop of dandelions; I leave the grass to grow long at this time of year so that the wild flowers get a chance - soon it will be full of Ox-Eye Daisies. It also encourages all the insects and pollinators and I often get dragonflies too. Then there are the newts in the bath ... yes, I did say bath.When the people who lived here before me replaced the modern bath with a freestanding, iron one, the old one ended up in the garden to be used as a pond. It's not the most attractive thing but the frogs and newts seem to like it. The old wooden panelling that I had round it has rotted away so it's going to be supported by its own little brick wall soon. Then I have plans to cover the top edges with some sort of mosaic tiles.A more attractive addition to the garden is the old sundial and bird bath that came down to me from my Grandmother and which looks as if it's been here forever. Here it is, complete with some bluebells. Can you see there's also a white bell there? I get quite a few of those.A new and very exciting addition to the garden is my little greenhouse which was a Christmas present from my daughter and her partner. It just fits against the side wall by the house and is already filling up nicely.There are propagators in front of various windows in the house and lots of seeds in the queue waiting to be sown. The trouble with old houses like mine is that they don't have windowsills. Well, they do but they're too narrow to put anything on. They are deep windows though so I can improvise with tables and, in this case, a trolley parked in front of them.It's always nice when you can combine your hobbies and I've recently learnt how to make origami pots out of newspaper to use as seed pots. Not only do these use up the bits of my Saturday paper (the only one I buy) that I don't read, but the seedlings can be potted on in their newspaper pots so the roots don't get disturbed.They look a lot less nice than this once they're full of compost and have been watered a bit but they do the job. It's very satisfying to re-use stuff like this. The seedlings then go into plastic pots but these can be washed and re-used umpteen times so I'm happy with that.More new additions - this time in the form of plant supports ...I had both Jack and Rose here this last weekend and, with their help, we got a huge amount done. Did you know that two healthy young adults can carry 110 kg of compost back from the shop in one go? While she was out fetching lots of heavy ceramic garden pots from my Mum's old house (yes, she really is quite strong, I put it down to all that practice pushing her partner's wheelchair), Jack and I put a few things together.He rescued me from this eight foot tall obelisk and it's now in place in the garden. The soil here is heavy clay and it was very hard work getting its legs in far enough. We had to make the holes first by hammering in a garden cane.It's there to support the climbing rose inside it which is about a foot tall at the moment but should grow to the top in time. It's a beautiful rose called The Pilgrim (after Chaucer's pilgrim in 'The Canterbury Tales') and has full yellow flowers, shading to cream. I only planted it last autumn as a bare root but it's got some buds so I can't wait to see them open.In the meantime, I got a clematis to share the obelisk with the rose and encourage it to greater things.The picture doesn't do it justice. That deep pink is a really vivid colour in real life. It's called Westerplatte and I made the mistake of looking it up online, only to find that it's named after a heroic stand by the Polish forces against the Germans in 1939. The colour is meant to represent the drops of fallen blood ... I shall try not to think of that when I look at the beautiful flowers.Do you see those very business-like looking bean sticks next to the obelisk? Don't be fooled, I haven't actually planted the runner beans yet (they're in the seed queue). The wall that they're against used to be covered with Irish ivy (which I've just discovered is also called Poet's Ivy). Much as I love it, I decided it didn't need to cover every inch of the wall so, earlier in the Spring, I went into battle with it. You'll be glad to know I won.Similarly, I've been demolishing the Winter Jasmine that dominated the side wall need the house ...Those sticks against the wall are all that's left - oh and the bits that have rooted between the bricks higher up. I've told it that it can stay if it promises not to get carried away again. I did have an ulterior motive for this lot of drastic pruning as that wall has to be propped up to stop it falling over. It's been there for over a hundred years and is definitely leaning. As you can see, it needs a lot of re-pointing too. That's going to be done soon so then I shall be able to plant things on that side of the garden again. It's the wall that gets the sun and I've got 16 sunflowers waiting in the greenhouse ...I hope you've enjoyed this little look at my garden; I'll try to update you on its progress later on. I enjoy writing blog posts but they do take a lot out of me so, as with everything, I have to pace  myself. Meanwhile, I'll leave you with a photo of my favourite flower in the garden - the humble Cowslip.* Since I wrote the first part of this post, Rose and I have been on another canal walk and we got a bit further - as far as the first lock on the way to Cropedy. I was very pleased with myself."},
{"title": "Bramble Yarn", "date": "Thursday 10 March 2022", "text": "I have a new favourite yarn and have got totally carried away with its possibilities.King Cole Bramble DK is a variegated yarn with a long colour run - oh how I love a long colour run - and it comes in these ten lovely shades. From left to right on the top row there's Mixed Berries, Heather, Loganberry, Chestnut and Raspberry (aren't the names nice?) On the bottom row there's Earth, Blueberry, Goldenberry, Gorse and Haze. I had to  look up Goldenberry which is, apparently, a rather exotic looking fruit. Bramble is a 100% Acrylic yarn - a joy to those of us plagued by moths - and, with 290 m per 100g knits to a standard DK tension. I'm starting to sound like an advert, aren't I? The only faults that I could find with this yarn were the knots which appeared from time to time, sometimes breaking the colour run. It would be a good yarn for my Ten Stitch patterns and no, I'm not planning to design another one of those any time soon. So, do you want to see what I've been using my Bramble yarn for?First of all, I'm crocheting a shawl, using Loganberry which is probably my favourite of the colours.It's nearly big enough but I have plans to add a collar, buttons and possibly pompoms, all of which require thinking and decision making, things that are difficult for me now so I keep putting it off.In the meantime, I've been playing with the possibilities of combining slip stitch and two shades of Bramble. First I made a couple of cowls using two similar shades so that the colours blended together. I've just published this pattern and you can download it from my Ravelry store Obviously, it's called Bramble Cowl.This one uses Loganberry and Chestnut.Then I decided to use contrasting shades - this time Raspberry and Earth - to make a scarf. I thought I would make it more interesting by working it diagonally which had the lucky effect of making the stitch pattern much simpler too. I rather like both sides of this pattern.It's now much longer than in these pictures and, again, is waiting for me to work out how to finish it. I'm going to sew the ends together so that it can be looped round the neck; I just need to get round to doing it ... and taking the photos.I've also been experimenting with using Bramble for weaving. The colours work out beautifully in these 6\" pin loom squares.This set of squares are all from a ball of Loganberry and I didn't plan them at all; they're just how they came from the ball. The next set are more subdued but equally pleasing I think. This time the shade is Goldenberry.I'm using one of the newer shades of Stylecraft Special DK, A Hint of Silver to edge my squares which I'm finding sets off all the colours very well. I'm probably going to weave four more sets of squares from different shaders and then turn them into a blanket.Yet more Loganberry, this time woven into tiny hexagons.I'm using my little Penny Loom from Turtle Looms to weave these. As each hexagon is so small, they come out a solid colour so I'm sorting them into pile of six and then turning them into flowers. Maybe one day it'll be a doll sized Granmother's Flower Garden blanket. I don't know if I shall stick to the Loganberry or use other colours too. The joy of this sort of yarn is that all the shades go together well.People often end this sort of post by saying that they were given the yarn to review etc etc ... well, I wasn't. I bought it myself and I love it!"},
{"title": "Spring Mantelpiece", "date": "Tuesday 1 March 2022", "text": "Today is the first day of Spring, meteorologically speaking, so I thought you might like to see my newly decorated Spring mantelpiece.The star of the show is my cross stitch sampler which I framed last week. Many of you will remember my daughter and I working on this series of samplers last year. I thoroughly enjoyed these projects, from the first stitches for each season ...... to the last ...It took me ages to decide on the mount and frame for each sampler but so far it's looking good.I'm really pleased with that mount - I think we used to call that colour mauve.Hanging above the mantelpiece is my Springtime Wreath from 2014. I had to re-attach one of the knitted chicks this year but, other than that, it's wearing well.The rest of the ornaments are a combination of pretty things and little treasures. I'm a big fan of windmills (the toy variety, although I have no objection to working ones); these are probably the smallest ones I've got.They're standing in one of my old green bottles. I'm trying to collect ten (obviously), each one different. They were displayed along the sash of the kitchen window ... until Tolly the cat knocked one off and broke it. He is a bad cat.On the other side of the sampler is one of my little Polish Peg Dolls - another one of my collections. I thought her outfit looked particularly Spring-like.Next to her there's another one of my little green bottles with a few random things on sticks that used to be my Mum's. She was partial to decorations on sticks; here we have a chick, a cat and a hen on a nest.The yellow teapot has been retired from use after I broke the spout off. It has sentimental value and I don't want to risk breaking it further. My kitchen floor is tiled with old stone tiles - anything dropped on it breaks - so now the teapot just looks pretty. Next to it is a very pretty little coffee cup from the 1930s. I have a somewhat eclectic collection of pretty china cups, all of which get used. I thought the flowers on this one were especially nice.I was going to round this post off with a photo of some of the Spring flowers in my garden but ... it's raining. Of course it is."},
{"title": "New Lamp for Old", "date": "Thursday 24 February 2022", "text": "Recently my Dad gave me a dirty, cracked and definitely not working wooden lamp base. Now you might think this wasn't the most thoughtful of presents but I was very pleased with it. You only have to look at this photograph from the early 1960s to see why.That's Mum and Dad and behind them is the lamp in its youth. It was a wedding present from the Midland Bank where Mum worked before they married in 1956. How do I know that? Because I still have Mum's wedding present list, presumably made to help her in writing thank-you letters.As you can see, Mum's colleagues also gave them a wooden fruit bowl which my brother now has. The lamp base is shaped like a wine glass and the drum shade was a wine red to match it.So, back to the present. I didn't think to take a photo before I cleaned it up but here it is, crack mended and polished. The wood was really pale and dry and responded well to lots of polish and elbow grease.The next thing to do was to replace the cable and bulb holder as it still had the original fittings which were standard in the UK before 1970. Does anyone else remember the days when you could do your ironing by plugging an adaptor into the bulb holder on the ceiling light? Here's a link to more information about plugs than anyone could want - except perhaps Mr Weasley.I found a very good website called Lamp Spares which had everything I wanted and the lamp was soon fitted with a new lead and bulb holder, complete with safety switch. What a good invention these are; it's impossible to turn the switch on unless a bulb is in the holder - I remember getting a nasty electric shock from a bedside lamp many years ago and it's not an experience I'd like to repeat.The trickiest part was replacing the green baize on the bottom of the base which had long since perished. I had one piece of green felt that was big enough but the new flex is thicker than the old one so the groove in the base wasn't deep enough for it. Rather than try to make the groove deeper I built up the felt with two layers of thick interfacing so that the lamp would stand flat.All it needed now was a lampshade and I wanted a big dark red drum shade to match its original one. Luckily, my local branch of B & Q had just what I wanted and they even had a sale on. My son walked there with me to carry things (I can't breath, walk and carry something, however light it is) and to remind me how to pay with my debit card. I think it's the first time I've done that for two years.And here is my new lamp. It's not a very good photo but the best I could manage.The colours are much richer in real life but you get the general idea. Do you see what the lamp is sitting on? That's my Mum's old workbox which is even older than the lamp; her Dad made it for her out of old packing boxes, along with the little bookcase that I talked about some time ago in this blog post. If you look back at the black and white picture at the start of today's post, you'll see that the lamp was sitting on the workbox then as well. And that's where it's going to live in its new life too."},
{"title": "Christmas Ornaments, Old and New", "date": "Saturday 1 January 2022", "text": "What's the oldest ornament on your Christmas tree? Mine is probably the fairy on the top.She hasn't always been a fairy though. She started life as a Rosebud doll back in the 1960s but her career as a doll was brought to an abrupt end when I dropped her in the back yard and her head broke. Mum carried out some emergency surgery (her hair covers the scars) but, wanting to avoid more tears the next time I dropped her, suggested that she might like to be the fairy on the Christmas tree. You can just about see her in this photo from Christmas 1966.And yes, that's me in my red nightie gazing up at at her happily. Over the years, she's had various changes of clothes ... well, not so much clothes as bits of lace wrapped round her and sewn in place.Next time, I'm going to make her a new pair of wings - less, shiny cardboard, more floaty gauze I think.This year we have been sorting out my late Mum's house and, amongst other things, we divided up the old Christmas decorations. Which leads me on to another treasured ornament. Can you see the Father Christmas on the swing in that old photo?I have no idea why he's on a swing; I must have missed that part of the traditional story. He has a fine handlebar moustache though. He was always one of my favourites and, this year, he's on my tree.He doesn't look bad for a gentleman of sixty.The newest decoration on my tree is this lovely felt cat, made for me by my daughter.Fans of Judith Kerr will recognise Mog the cat who definitely doesn't approve of Christmas, hence the glum look. When she sees a tree moving about she takes refuge on the roof and refuses to come down ...                        'Mog stayed on the roof. Some white things fell out of the sky. Some                         fell on the roof and some fell on Mog. They were very cold.'To find out what happens next (don't worry, there's a happy ending), you'll have to read Mog's Christmas.Have you got any treasured ornaments on your Christmas tree?"},
{"title": "Badges and Brooches", "date": "Tuesday 21 December 2021", "text": "When I was taking photos of my Round Nesting Boxes recently, I rooted out some of my old badges and brooches to put in them.Before putting them away again, I took some photos as I thought you might like to see some of them. In the smallest box there's what you could call my magpie brooches - shiny ones!I love the pretty costume jewellery you find with a coloured stone surrounded by metalwork.The ones on the right are useful for keeping shawls in check; I've had all three of them for many years. The rest of the metal brooches are a mixture of fun ones and those associated with particular places / organisations / groups - I can't think of a word that covers them all.The yellow oval is from the Children's Liver Disease Foundation, the charity I support through my work and the blue one next to it is from the Ring of Tatters. The three crests below represent the Universities my children and I went to. The one in the middle is Birmingham where I read English in the early 1980s. The red birds are Queen's where Jack read Maths and the last one is Lincoln where Rose read History.In the next box are a selection of homemade brooches.There are felt ones, beaded ones and a few based on Dorset Buttons, all made by me ...I recently got a wonderful new book on Dorset Buttons from Gina-B Silkworks (their website is a great place to lose yourself) and am looking forward to working through it. When I do, I'll share my progress with you. In the meantime, here's a little brooch I made recently for a friend's birthday/The other handmade brooches are much older, dating from the 1950s and 60s.Patterns for these embroidered brooches would have been found in magazines of the time. Several of these were embroidered by my Mum as a young woman, others have been bought by me in antique shops.What's next? More pretty old brooches.My collection of china posy brooches, mostly dating from the mid twentieth century. These were made by various Staffordshire potteries and I just love them.Most of mine were picked up in charity shops and the like but I have one given to me by a friend that belonged to her late mother and that dark red one was my Great-Grandmother's. One day I'm going to make a little fabric cushion to display them on.The last two boxes have more humdrum contents. First, there's my collection of Shakespeare badges.Before being struck down by Covid (and the never-ending Long Covid) Jack and I were regulars at the RSC which is only half an hours drive from here. As well as the programmes, I was building up a good collection of quotes badges too.''Though she be but little, she is fierce' (Midsummer Night's Dream) struck a chord with so many that you can now find it used on all sorts of merchandise. Also shown are quotes from 'Love's Labour's Lost', 'Much Ado About Nothing', King Lear', 'As You Like It' and many more.The contents of the final box might best be described as 'all the rest'.There are book badges ...... lots of puffins as I'm a collector of Puffin books. The Elmer badge was one of several I made for a  session at the Puffin shop in Covent Garden in 1991 when David McKee was signing his books.The little boy at the front of the picture is my son, Jack, then aged three and yes, I knitted his Elmer jumper.A few political badges next - that 'Don't blame me, I voted Labour' badge has been useful far too many times since I got it in 1983.'For the many, not the few' was the slogan of Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party - says it all.These next ones are a mixed bunch. I particularly like my 'Santa's Little Helper' badge and the one about turning into your mother - happened years ago here! Quite a few of these were bought at News From Nowhere, a wonderful bookshop in Liverpool.I also bought this card at News From Nowhere which is part of my Christmas display every year ...The last collection are my knitting badges. And, before you ask, no, I can't remember where I got them but I think it was online so you could probably find them.Aren't these great? Which ones do you like best? Perhaps the fact that I like 'Knitting for the Resistance' and 'Armed with pointy sticks' says something about my less than placid nature!"},
{"title": "Busy Bees", "date": "Thursday 25 November 2021", "text": "I thought you'd like to see something a bit different today. I don't normally accept commissions but when my son asked if I could knit bride and groom bees for his friends' wedding cake, I couldn't resist the challenge. It was actually a celebration of their wedding which had to be cancelled last year because of Covid restrictions. They got married in a registry office instead and have only just been able to mark the occasion with friends and family.Why bees? I don't really know, other than they like bees. The theme of the wedding was 'Alice in Wonderland' so it could really have been any creatures. I'm quite glad they didn't want a pair of Cheshire Cats.Designing the bodies of the bees was quite straightforward, although it was a bit tricky trying to keep the small enough. The real problems came when trying to give them antennae and legs. A combination of pipe cleaners and thread wrapped wire did the trick though.For the wings I used more wire, wrapped with cream yarn. So far, so good. Then I had to turn them into a bride and groom. For the groom I just added a purple felt tie (somehow, this photo looks unseemly) ...But oh, that veil for the bride ... I could only find one piece of lace and it was too big, too floppy and looked ridiculous. Fitting a veil on something with wings is hard. In the end, I starched the lace and pressed it into folds give it a bit of shape and then gathered the head end tightly and sewed on some tiny pearl beading. I thought the little artificial flowers made it look more like a veil and less like a bit of old net curtain.I had the bees finished about a week before the wedding and they were very pleased with them. Here's a photo of the bees on the cake. Not a very good photo - taken by Jack on his phone in poor light conditions - but you can see them.All the decorations on the cake, except the bottom log and the bees, were made out of icing. Isn't that amazing? Even the cup and saucer which look just like china.Here's wishing Ian and Tori a long and happy life together."},
{"title": "Aunty Ivy and the Lobster", "date": "Tuesday 16 November 2021", "text": "Let me start by introducing you to Aunty Ivy. She was actually my Great-Aunt and she was born in 1899. Ivy was the third child of Annie and George Cannons and their first daughter. They would have eight children all together, six of whom survived infancy. Here is Ivy at the age of  13 with two of her younger sisters.Eva, seated, was 8 and the little one is four year old Ada. I know their ages when this photograph was taken as their mother had written them on the back but I also have that most useful record for all family historians - the family bible.It's big, very heavy and has the family births, marriages and deaths recorded at the front. Here is Ivy, between the two babies who died. At the top of the list is her brother George and the last entry on the page is for Eva who was born in 1903.Over the page are the last three children: Ada, John (always called Jack) and Ida, born in 1908, 1911 and 1915 respectively.You've seen Eva and Ada already; here is George with his baby brother Jack in a photograph taken when George was 15 and Jack six months. Jack's middle name of Noel was given to him because he was born on Christmas Day.Like the picture of the three sisters, this is a typical formal family photograph of the time. This photo of the youngest child, my Grandmother Ida, is a bit more relaxed.So, that's Ivy and her brothers and sisters. Their births, marriages and deaths are in the bible and then there we also have a few photographs of them as children and of some of their marriages. Here is Aunty Ivy on her wedding day in 1924.All but one of Ivy's siblings are in this photo; George was meant to be the Best Man but didn't turn up ... one day I'll tell you the long and mysterious story of Uncle George. Anyway, I think that's Eva standing next to Ivy and Ada at the other end of the same row. The boy in front of her is Jack and the little girl in the middle is Ida.In the early twentieth century photographs were only taken to mark special occasions so for snapshots of daily life we have to look elsewhere. In my case, this is a huge collection of family postcards dating from 1904 to the present. My Great-Grandmother Annie collected them for the pictures but now we're just as interested in the writing on the back. In a time before telephones, postcards were often used to tell someone which train you'd be arriving on for a visit or that you'd got home safely afterwards. There are lots of the \"hoping this finds you as it leaves me\" variety that don't tell us much.There are exceptions though ... this one from 1905 has always intrigued me.The Edie who didn't want anyone to know about her marriage was one of my Great-Grandmother's sisters. Why the secrecy? The couple's first child wasn't born until 1907 so it wasn't a hasty wedding. Whatever the reason, Edie and George went on to have seven children and were together until George's death in 1940.Then there's this one from Ivy's brother George (yes, him again).Written when he was nearly 16 and (I think) working on the railways, George's message to his mother is intriguing. What does \"look out for a surprise don't say I didn't warn you\" mean? It could be anything from a new haircut to ... well, I don't know what. In the top left corner he's put \"Don't worry\" which is no help at all. Over a hundred years later, we still don't know what the surprise was.I mustn't keep getting distracted; this story is meant to be about Aunty Ivy. In 1907 one of Ivy's aunts took her back with them to London for a visit and sent a postcard to her mother to let her know how she was getting on.It looks like eight year old Ivy was enjoying herself. The upside down postcript at the top of the card reads \"Ivy says tell Mother I have not cried. I like being in London\".Like all her sisters except the youngest, Ivy went into service as a young girl, as her mother had before her. This would have meant living in the house of her employer which is why we have various postcards home from her, often addressed to her little sisters. There is this one to Eva wishing her a Happy 11th Birthday in 1914 ...... and this one to Ada a year later ...Oh the superiority of the older sister \"I expect you think you are a big girl now you are seven year old\". I wonder what the knitting was that's mentioned in this next one, again to Eva.There are also several postcards where the picture is related to the war (World War One, 1914 - 1918). Here is Ivy writing to her father in 1915.Luckily, George who was now in his forties didn't join the army. He would have been too old when conscription was introduced the following year and I think that his job on the railway would probably have counted as a reserved occupation anyway.The next card is to Ivy's little brother Jack, not a picture postcard for his album but another one referencing the war.This next one was a novelty postcard produced with various town names on during the war; Ivy's family were living in Wimborne, Dorset at the time but they did settle in Andover in the 1920s. This card suggests that they already knew the town, perhaps through their father's work on the railway.When you opened the flap, all you could see was an expanse of solid black which was what it was to be hoped the town would look like in the event of a Zeppelin raid .This novelty card leads me - finally - to the lobster. It's 1928 and Ivy and her husband Reg are on holiday in Littlehampton. Open the flap and the lobster reveals  a concertina of black and white images of the seaside town.Very nice too, not what you'd call a chatty card (the Kemps are family cousins) but I expect Ivy's younger sister Ida enjoyed it. But now, nearly a hundred year's later, Aunty Ivy's lobster postcard has got a new lease of life.Yes, that's right, it's the lobster from the postcard, now gracing a London bus stop. And here it is again ..This is the window of The Postal Musem in London where my daughter works as one of the archivists and all those lobsters are on posters advertising their current exhibition marking 151 years of the British postcard. 151 years rather than 150 as the original exhibition was planned for 2020 but had to be postponed because of the pandemic.Wish You Were Here runs until the end of the year and features postcards from the past, exploring themes from romance and war to the Great British seaside holiday. For those unable to visit the exhibition in person (which of course includes me), this video gives you a tour of the highlights. Some of the postcards you can see in the seaside section are from our collection.The Postal Museum Blog is a fascinating read too for those interested in social history. Amongst the interesting human stories from within their collections are several posts directly relating to this exhibition. Postcards from the Front looks at the cards sent by soldier Harry Brown to his mother during the First World War, while Seaside Postcards is an entertaining read. I also enjoyed Creating an exhibition in the middle of a pandemic; putting an exhibition on is much more than just sticking a few things in a case.Another exciting aspect of the exhibition from a purely personal point of view was the fact that some of our postcards were used to create items to sell in the  museum shop. In this video the artist Emily May talks about turning some of the postcards into watercolours which were then used to created things to sell in the museum shop to accompany the exhibition.Obviously, I had to buy a few things ...I'm particularly pleased with the tea towel which I shall probably use to make a bag.In this close up, I can see several of our postcards ...As well as the lobster, the blue bus and the donkey are ours. Can you spot them?I thought it would be nice to talk about a few of our other postcards that are in the museum and the people behind them. I didn't have photos of these ones so I'm grateful to The Postal Museum for permission to use theirs. First of all, some gentle seaside humour.This one was sent by Uncle Jack, who we last saw as a small boy at Ivy's wedding, to my Mum and Dad in September 1956. This is what he wrote on the back ...The Saturday referred to was the day of Ann and David's wedding and it was indeed windy. This is probably my favourite of their wedding photos.A year later and my brother Stephen was a new baby and he and Mum and Dad were staying at Mum's parents while they were on holiday in Dorset. I suspect they were looking after the garden and the pigeons (Grandad kept racing pigeons for many years). This is the postcard sent to them by Ida.The writing on the back manages to include baby Stephen's weight, a roast goose and blue jellyfish - can't you fit a lot on a postcard?And here we have a photo of Stephen as a baby to confirm that he was indeed putting on weight well, although he doesn't look very happy about it.We have a whole series of postcards sent to Stephen by his Granny, some of which bear the marks of having been chewed on. He particularly liked ones with a squeaker in but, sadly, these couldn't be used in the exhibition. There were other novelty cards to choose from though. She chose this one a few years later which opens out in the middle in the same way as the lobster card does.Here is Stephen with his Granny about this time. He seems to have slimmed down a bit.In 1961 Ida was on holiday in Weymouth and sent Stephen this postcard.By turning the wheel at the top, more pictures could be seen. Stephen had obviously moved on from just chewing the cards. Here's the writing on the back ...... and yes, Frances is me. I was born in 1960. Here I am in my pram with Stephen considering me. He looks quite pleased - not sure about me.I love the sentiment on the front of this next card, again from my Granny.They were staying at Butlins Holiday Camp and, having brought up four children, including for several years on her own during the war, she definitely appreciated a bit of time off.One more of our postcards from the exhibition, this one sent to me in 1968.Suzanne and Carole are our cousins, a few years younger than me. Here we are in our garden at Longstock at around that time (I'm the one in the green dress).Before I go, I've got one more picture to show you. This is Aunty Ivy's Golden Wedding Anniversary in 1975 and quite a few of the people I've been talking about are there, as they were fifty years before. Apart from Ivy and Reg obviously, the woman next to Reg (with her arms crossed) is Eva and the man with the cigarette in his mouth at the end of the row is Jack. Next to him, wearing glasses, is Ida. I think Ada must be there too but I'm not sure which one she is."},
{"title": "Walking", "date": "Wednesday 27 October 2021", "text": "As long standing (and long suffering?) readers of my blog will know, before Long Covid moved in to stay I used to go for a lot of country walks. Now that breathing is something that has to be monitored and handled with care, this is obviously not possible. What I have been doing though is a daily walk, building it up very slowly.I started in late January by walking round the block, the same route every day - a distance of 0.5 miles. The idea is that doing the same route gives me less decisions to make (decisions make me tired) and also gives me landmarks to measure how I'm doing.So, many months later, I'm now up to one mile and the walk now extends to take in the park which is nice.Things I have learnt:Walk slowly. I'm naturally a bustler but, if I walk too quickly, I run out of breath.Walking on grass (or in snow) makes it much harder to breathe.It's easier to walk earlier in the day when I'm not so tired. This only dawned on me last week when I ran out of breath and only just made it home.When I run out of breath and start to feel dizzy, I need to stop for five minutes ... even if I'm nearly home (see point 3)!    I am now an expert on the local front gardens, who has what plants and which houses have dogs or cats. You can find something interesting on even the shortest walk.But ... it's not countryside. Nor is this but it's a lot more like it ...This is the view from the slightly soggy bench where Jack, Rose and I had a picnic last weekend. This is Spiceball Park which is in the middle of Banbury, right next to the canal and it's the furthest I've walked from home. It was so nice to see all that green and the trees (and my flask of tea was good too). After the picnic we had a bit of a walk round by the river and back along the canal path.By this point, we realised that I'd probably done a bit too much so Rose and I sat on a bench for another rest while Jack found me a conker. The walk home was very slow and I ended up leaning on Rose before we got there. But - I'd walked two and a half miles all together. It's not something I could do regularly but it did me good. I was wondering why my face felt different and I realised it was because I kept smiling."},
{"title": "Marmaduke and Stanley", "date": "Wednesday 20 October 2021", "text": "Today I thought I'd introduce you to two friends, one old and one new. First of all, meet Marmaduke.As you can see, Marmaduke is a mouse troll with orange fur and he's a very old friend that I thought I'd lost. He turned up in a box of various small toys when we were sorting through a cupboard last weekend and, after a clean up, he really looks good, considering he's over fifty years old. I'd forgotten his name but, as soon as I picked him up, it came back to me. I suspect I named him after Marmaduke Stanley, the cook / housekeeper in one of my favourite books, The Little White Horse by Elizabeth Goudge.Marmaduke is special because he brings back a nice memory of Mum and me having 'spendies' on a shopping trip when I was little. I remember being very excited at being able to choose things, just like that. This is where we went - Andover High Street in the 1960s.I have no idea what Mum got for herself but I do remember choosing a red bouncy ball and then spotting Marmaduke. He was in a clear plastic box with a hole in so you could feel the fur and I can still remember how soft he felt; I thought I'd never seen anything so wonderful. Mum and I would have fun shopping together for many years but this was the first time that I remember.Moving on, I bet you're wondering what sort of toy Stanley is going to turn out to be. Meet Stanley the Vice ...Stanley the Vice - isn't that a great name? He only arrived yesterday and is already proving to be a very useful sort of friend. And no, he didn't come with the eyes already fitted; I have to say, I think the manufacturers are missing a trick there. This is what he was helping me with this morning ...... drilling holes in lots of little wooden shapes. My daughter Rose and I bought a big bag of wooden shapes for £1 at Orinoco, our new scrap shop. It's full of donated and recycled craft supplies and yes, it's named after the Womble of the same name. All together now:                                            'Underground, overground, wombling free,                                            The Wombles of Wimbledon Common are we.                                            Making good use of the things that we find,                                                                                     Things that the everyday folk leave behind.' I think these wooden shapes will make great gift tags or decorations, they just needed holes to hang them up by - hence Stanley's involvement. I predict a happy future for Stanley and me. I think he's going to be very useful for all sorts of crafts.Before I go, look what else I bought from Orinoco.Don't get too excited - they're empty (although they do sell old knitting patterns too). These three files would have come from a yarn shop and cost me £1. I'm planning to fill them with some of my collection of old knitting patterns. Isn't that a fitting use for them? In fact, I may go and do that now."},
{"title": "Handy Bag", "date": "Tuesday 12 October 2021", "text": "My new pattern is a riot of colour, featuring no less than twelve different shades of yarn.This is my Handy Bag, worked in the round using my favourite knitting technique - slip stitch. This gives a lovely, complicated looking finish while being super easy to do. But what about all those ends to sew in, I hear you cry?Just knot them together and hide them under a fabric lining. Problem solved. Actually, I think the wrong side of this stitch pattern looks good too ...What with changing colour every two rounds, I found it  handy to make a little shade card to remind me which one to use next. You can also pre-cut lengths of yarn, should you not feel like carting round twelve balls of yarn in your knitting bag. As I hardly leave the house, this wasn't a problem for me.Inspired by fabric bags with a contrasting casing sewn on to the outside, I decided to copy this look. It turned out to be quite straightforward to do actually.The top of the bag uses a reversible stitch pattern so that it looks good on the inside too as that part of the bag isn't lined.I used another fun technique for the drawstrings to give a double sided strip with the knit side of stocking stitch on both sides. I like to knit outdoors and wanted to be able to attach the handles / drawstrings of the bag to my chair handle to keep it off the ground. I was going to put buttons and buttonholes on the end but then my son pointed out that I would be too lazy to button and unbutton them and suggested a magnetic clasp instead.And here it is in action - out in the garden on a sunny day recently.Obviously, you can use any combination of colours for your bag. Mine was inspired by this charity shop scarf that I bought ages ago, purely because I liked the combination of colours.I think choosing colours for a project is one of my favourite parts of designing.You can also adapt the pattern to make other sizes of bag. I made a little gift bag on half the number of stitches; here it is having a cuddle with the Mother bag.I hope you like this pattern. It would be lovely to see your own versions of it; I really like it when people start with one of my patterns and develop into something uniquely their own.The next pattern will either be a set of knitted round nesting boxes like the square ones I published earlier this year or a crochet mini stocking, similar in size to my Mini Dotty Stocking."},
{"title": "Playing with Colour Pops", "date": "Tuesday 21 September 2021", "text": "You can never have too many colours, right?This pile of colour pegs represents the planning for my new pattern, Rainbow Strip. This little wall hanging is my latest experiment with my colour pop technique, something I've been playing around with for years. Basically, it's a way of adding three dimensional coloured rolls to a plain knitted background. I've been fine-tuning how to actually do this with various projects until finally I think I've got a method I'm happy with.Here are my first attempts at colour pops from more than ten years ago, all unpublished.A slightly wonky purse in variegated sock yarn, two wristbands and a ring. As you can see, I was concentrating more on the texture than the colours here. I rather like the wristbands though; you probably can't see them in the photo but the black one has tiny little black beads sewn between the rolls of knitting.Fast forward to 2012 and I contributed these blanket squares to a charity blanket campaign in aid of Refuge, organised by 'The Knitter' magazine. I wonder if anybody ever knitted them?The next year I published a pattern for a Colour Pop Cuff which used garter stitch throughout.In all the colour pop variations, the strips of colour are worked separately from the background colour and then joined together on the back. With these two patterns this was achieved with some dexterity and the knitting needles.By 2016 I had developed the idea of 'zipping up' the strips with a sewing needle. This is the technique used  for my Winter Rainbow scarf published at the start of the year. Having first worked in stocking stitch with the purl side as the right side and then in garter stitch, I'd now settled on stocking stitch with the knit side showing.This is one my favourite scarves. Many of the scarves I design never get worn but I wear this one regularly; as well as being bright and cheerful, it's also nice and warm.So far, so good. I then had a bit of a digression with my knitted rug pattern, Corduroy. The squares for this were knitted in solid colours with the rolls being purl side out stocking stitch. Closing the stocking stitch strips involved picking up stitches with a second needle and then knitting them together with those on the first needle on to a third. Confused? It's not as bad as it sounds, honestly.I then had a bit of a break from the colour pops until earlier this year when I hit upon the idea of knitting a few, purely decorative things using the technique. The idea is that each will have a different theme and will use a different hanging method. Then knitters could use them to design their own Colour Pop art.So far I've knitted two of these and am planning a third. If people like them (and I don't lose interest) I may go on to design a series of practical colour pop patterns. Which takes me back to my Rainbow Strip.In this pattern the colour pops are worked closely together. This caused me a problem as the white side borders were being pulled out of shape so I had to add short rows on each side to make it all lie flat. Other than that, it's quite a simple pattern that could easily be adapted to make a different sized hanging or to use different colours. Apparently, it's not always necessary to use 24 colours in one small project.Actually, I think this would look good just in shades of one or two colours as well. What about blues and greens, perhaps with a wider border that you could decorated with seaside charms or buttons? I used wooden sticks and a curtain ring to hang my finished strip which looks lovely against my sunshine yellow wall.The next Colour Pop pattern will be this Christmas Tree which I'll publish later this year.This pattern develops the basic idea to include different widths and depths of colour pops, making the technique much more versatile.And the pattern after that ... is still only a sketch."},
{"title": "Embroidery Old and New", "date": "Monday 30 August 2021", "text": "As part of the ongoing process of sorting my late Mum's house and re-configuring mine, I've been having fun rescuing my collection of old magazines from the damp cellar. This is a slow process, involving the de-humidifier and a certain amount of mould removal (I'll spare you the details) but I'm making progress. As ever, I've got help from my trusty companion Tolly, seen here doing his best rectangle impersonation. These are the magazines I'm most excited about finding again ...Does anyone else remember these? 'Needlecraft' magazine was published from the early 1990s for more than ten years and featured a wide range of needlecraft techniques. There was lots of cross stitch but also needlepoint, bobbin lace, stumpwork, embroidery ... and more. They had very good articles on the history of various forms of needlework too. The earliest issue I've got is number 4 which came out in October 1991and the latest one is Issue 63 from April 2004. I've been trying to find out when it ceased publication but with no luck so far. If anyone can help me with this, I'd be very grateful. It would be nice to fill in the gaps.Anyway, while waiting for the latest batch to dry out, I fished out some of my old needlework magazines from the 1930s onwards to browse through.Those yellow 'Good Needlework and Knitting' magazines from the 1930s are particularly nice. They were a somewhat eclectic mixture of embroidery, knitting and crochet with handy household hints and recipes thrown in for good measure. They also featured long, serial stories. Unlike craft magazines of today, patterns for the embroidery designs weren't included, instead you were given tips on working from selected transfers which you could then order.I was looking at an issue from November 1937 the other day when my eye was caught by this picture on the front cover.Unusually, this was a free gift in the form of a pre-printed handkerchief sachet, all ready to embroider with your own threads. Free transfers were often included with magazines of this date but I hadn't come across an actual item like this before. I'm rather fond of old handkerchief sachets, probably because I'm one of the few remaining people (according to my children) who still uses proper hankies. These are hard to find new nowadays but you can pick up lots of pretty ones from antique stalls quite cheaply; this is where most of mine have come from.Somehow, this picture was ringing a faint bell and, after a quick look along a shelf on the middle landing, I realised why.Knowing my love for old embroideries, my daughter bought me this one years ago and there it was, one of the original sachets, embroidered by a reader of the magazine more than eighty years ago. Here are the instructions from the magazine ...As well as this sachet, readers got a free transfer for a companion piece called 'The Lily-Pool' so that the two designs could be stitched as complementary pictures.You can see this second picture better here ...Now, amongst the many craft-related things that I collect, are old embroidery transfers. So I thought it would be worth fishing them out to have a look through.And look what I found - not one, but two copies of the original transfer given away with 'Good Needlework'.Something tells me I shall have to embroider this one some day to stand alongside my other one. Anyway, back to the more modern magazines. There I was, browsing through the latest batch a few days later, when guess what I spotted in a magazine from 2003?Does that embroidered picture on the right of the cover look familiar? That's right, it's the original design from the free gift in 1937.The editor of 'Needledcraft' at the time, Debora Bradley, found an original picture like mine in the attic of her parents' house. It had been embroidered by her brother's Godmother, Beatrice Walker.  Here you can see her work.'Needlecraft' commissioned a graduate of the Royal School of Needlework, Zoe Patching, to re-create the original design. Her pattern is very faithful to the original but uses paler shades and some beads to give added texture. Of course, the original stitchers would have used their own threads; exact shades were not specified as they would be now, just general guidelines for colours.That's my embroidery on the left and Beatrice's on the right.All this made me think it would be interesting to compare the two magazines, published 86 years apart.Although both magazines have colourful front covers, the modern one is obviously much more colourful inside as you would expect. The other thing that first struck me was the adverts. There are lots of these in 'Good Needlework', reflecting the different pastimes of the day - everything from piano music ...... to dance lessons.There are also, of course, lots of needlework related adverts like the one on this page for linen to embroider. Although there where quite a lot of adverts in the early issues of 'Needlecraft', the advent of the internet and more subtle forms of advertising had drastically reduced their number by the new century. This 2003 issue had very few obvious adverts, most were hidden in short pieces about new kits and products. Advertising is much more subtle nowadays. There were, however, a few pages of small ads. These were quite wide ranging, including some for Patchwork fabrics as the popularity of American style Patchwork was already growing.Interestingly though, there were still a few ads for linens which wouldn't have been out of place in a magazine from the thirties.Sadly, it was something of a last hurrah though as Copeland Linens had closed earlier that year. I'm guessing that they were selling off their stock here. The two main publishers of embroidery transfers in the thirties were Deightons and William Briggs, both of whom had been in existence since Victorian times. Deightons is still going but now supplies painted needlepoint canvases painted to order. Briggs has ceased trading but you can pick up original transfers from both companies fairly cheaply online. You can also download the 1880 book of designs in which Briggs sought to patent the transfer technique in 1880. You can save the book as a pdf which enables you to print off pages and trace them with a Transfer Pencil, should you want to work any of the lovely designs. Dover Books are one of several publishers who produce books of embroidery transfers nowadays and many of their out of print titles are available secondhand. Try searching for iron on transfers or designs and you'll find lots of inspiration, both vintage and modern. One book that looks like a nice combination of the two is Lorna Bateman's 'Embroidered Country Gardens'.Where was I? Oh yes, comparing the magazines. As the title shows, 'Good Needlework and Knitting' also featured knitting patterns, many of which are stylish and technically quite complicated. They assumed a high level of knitting knowledge in their readers.I'm constantly amazed by how small the sizes are in old knitting patterns ... unless, of course, you were classified as a 'matron'.She doesn't look best pleased, does she?There are virtually no knitting patterns in my 'Needlework' patterns; indeed, several early issues contain complaints that there are no UK knitting magazines and wishes for a knitting revival. It's easy to forget that, not so many years ago, knitting was still considered a dying art.Both 'Good Needlework' and 'Needlecraft' feature different types of needlework, although the older magazine has mostly embroidery and the newer one cross stitch. There's a cutwork table set in 'Good Needlework' ...and some embroidered napkins and a tray cloth.'Needlework' had a range of embroidery and cross stitch designs but also this pattern for a stumpwork sunflower ...... and a patchwork teddy bear.Interestingly, they had another design that harked back to the past with this picture in Berlin Woolwork which was very popular in Victorian times.I think they had a bit of a historical theme with this issue as there was also an article on historical samplers.Earlier issues of 'Needlecraft' had pages of technical tips and answers to letters, although I don't remember anyone ever worrying about their lingerie seams as one correspondent did in 'Good Needlework'.'Good Needlework' also featured fashion pages which were normally in colour and pointed reader towards fashionable dressmaking patterns, including lots of lingerie designs.There were also suggestions for children's clothes. I'm guessing that these frocks would have gone out of fashion very quickly with the advent of war against Germany.To our modern eyes, the inclusion of a long serial story, taking up many pages seems a little out of place but many 1930s women would have relied on printed stories in magazines for a bit of escapism - very few would have had television and radio drama in the UK was rather high brow until after the war.I have quite a lot of old embroideries around the house, some that I've bought and some worked by my Mum; I even have a firescreen embroidered by my Great Grandmother somewhere. Here's one they bought I few years ago from an antique shop in Honiton.It was the last day of our holiday and, with four adults in a small car, I'd decreed that nobody was to buy anything else ... and then I saw this. Needless to say, it travelled home with us, squashed into the back with my passengers.And here is the newest piece of needlework in my house - my finished Summer Sampler. Which, now I come to think of it, is a nice combination of new and old as samplers are such a traditional form of embroidery.All that remains is to frame all four samplers and I shall be able to admire them in turn throughout the coming year. I've enjoyed working all of them but I think perhaps this one was my favourite. The colours are beautiful and there was such a lot of variety to keep it interesting."},
{"title": "The Ladder Chair", "date": "Friday 20 August 2021", "text": "I spend a lot of time outdoors in the summer, regardless of the temperature. Unless it's actually raining, there I am. This is my favourite chair.It's an old Ercol chair that I found in an Antique shop a few years ago. I like the way the varnish has worn on the arms over its years of use. The patchwork cushion is one made by my Mum when she first started quilting. Normally, this chair lives in the scullery but gets to move out on to the patio at this time of year.Unfortunately, I'm not the only one who likes sitting in this chair ...I put the chair out, go inside to fetch my cup of tea or my knitting and there's Tolly, fast asleep and pretending he's been there for hours and can't possibly be disturbed. Short of taking out another kitchen chair specially for him - and yes, I have been known to do that - what can I do? Then I had a brainwave ... the ladder chair.This is a small, white child's chair that has been used by several generations, including my children. Here's their Uncle Peter sitting on it in about 1960. It seems to be two colours there.And here's my son Jack some 29 years later ... look at that hair!Sometimes the ladder chair could be shared with a special friend ...Jack and Big Bear waiting for a biscuit... or a little sister ... Here's Rose in 1993 - again, look at all that hair.One more, this time with both of them in.All these photos were taken at out old house in Peckham. Those big doors dividing the two downstairs rooms could be folded back against the walls to make one big room which was very handy for birthday parties.I don't know who first called it the ladder chair but, as the name suggests, it came in very handy when they couldn't reach something. On one notable occasion Rose used it to reach her pig birthday cake which I'd left out on the side in the kitchen and pulled one of the pigs' bottoms off. You'll be glad to know I managed to stick it back on before the birthday tea.Mum made a special cushion for the ladder chair with 'Jack' on one side and 'Rose' on the other.Nowadays, the ladder chair lives in the kitchen with Red Raggy and the first teddy bear I made sitting on it. Oh, and an old toy dog seems to have joined them for this photo.So, back to Tolly the cat who thinks he's a human. I had the bright idea of giving him a cat sized chair in the garden.As you can see, it worked for a while but he still prefers adult sized chairs if he can get them. Maybe he knows it's not his name on the cushion?Meanwhile, my other cat, Linnet wouldn't demean herself to sit on such a small chair. Her favourite spot is on top of whatever jigsaw I'm currently working on. I try to get it out very, very quietly but there are velcro tabs on the puzzle board and, as soon as she hears them, she comes dashing into the room to jump up on it.She then rolls around asking for strokes before standing up, shaking fur all over the puzzle and leaving. One day she rolled so far she fell off the edge of the board on to the floor. Luckily I managed to catch the puzzle.The joy of sharing your life with cats."},
{"title": "A bit of this ...", "date": "Friday 13 August 2021", "text": "... and a bit of that. This is what I do when I'm too tired to work on anything properly (which is quite a lot of the time). So, for the last few weeks, I've been flitting between various projects and not particularly enjoying any of them.First of all, I've been working on a sort of cray patchwork knitted block. It's only sort of crazy because there's actually an underlying order to it.I started with the 3\" green square in the middle, then picked up and knitted the stitches for the 1\" red strip, the 2\" blue strip and the 3\" cream strip in turn. The last three strips, still working clockwise, are 1, 2 and 3\" wide respectively. As you can see, each strip or patch is worked in a different textured stitch which was a bit tricky as, of course, the tension varies between them. The whole thing measures about 9\" after blocking. The plan is to start with each of the six colours in turn and to knit six of each colour variation - are you still with me? What with that and turning them round as I sew them together, I'm hoping that the finished blanket will look suitably random.What's next? Ah yes, my colourwork knitting.Twelve colours, changing colour every two rounds, one round slip stitch, one round knit. I love how this looks but all those ends were going to be a problem. So, I decided just to knot them together.The wrong side of the stitch pattern looks nice too, doesn't it? It will be hidden when the project is finished though as this is going to be a bag with a fabric lining - got to hide all those ends.I was getting on well with this until I came to what to do at the top of the bag. I'm torn between a fiddly knitted casing for a drawstring (which I think will look nicer but people might not want to knit) and eyelets (simpler but boring). Next is a nice easy crochet project.I'm making myself a shawl with the lovely King Cole Bramble DK. This shade is called Loganberry and I bought the yarn with some Wool Warehouse vouchers I got for my last birthday from a friend (thank-you Pat if you're reading this). I also bought the hook for the project as I found I needed a 6.5 mm one, bigger than I normally use. My favourite crochet hooks are the Clover Amour hooks which are comfortable to use and come in a range of different colours so you can spot the size you want easily. I already had orange (2.5 mm), pink, (3.5 mm - I use this one a lot), purple (4 mm - can't actually find this one at the moment, it's probably hiding in an old project bag), turquoise (4.5 mm), green (5.5 mm) and now this bright green one. They're more expensive than normal hooks but I think they're well worth it.Anyway, the shawl is worked in moss stitch, using a combination of double and treble stitches. I'm thinking of adding some sort of collar when it's finished and probably buttons or tassels - or both.The last of the projects I'm working on at the moment is a blanket I started two pattern notebooks ago in June 2017 so it's about time I finished it. I spent last week sewing the squares together, one strip a day and am now knitting on the borders, 200 stitches or so at a time.This one should be finished soon ... if I can find a big enough space to block it in. It's only a small blanket but there's stuff all over the floor (as normal).In between all this work knitting and crochet, I'm still enjoying my cross stitch. I'm getting towards the end of the last of my seasonal samplers.I think this might be my favourite. It's lovely to work on but makes me very tired so I can only do little bits at a time. I've just got to finish that tree and then I'll be on to the border.Needless to say, my daughter Rose finished hers weeks ago.I was most put out. Not only did she beat me by weeks (again) but she got 'July' to sign while I shall have 'August' which is two letters longer. And no, I'm not petty at all! Here are all four of Rose's samplers ...We're hoping to choose and order our frames soon so that we're ready to display each of them during their season. I'm looking forward to that."},

Not all of my existing list of followers has yet been added to the new system though so, if you don't get an email when I publish a new post, you might like to re-follow me to make sure you don't miss any of my witterings! Pat / Woolhelmina  by Pat's husband, SteveAs many of you in the knitting world will know, Pat Ashforth died a few weeks ago. Pat was a Mathematician, an inspiring knitting and crochet designer and a good friend to many. I've known Pat since I first bought her patterns by post many years ago and her work has continued to amaze me ever since - not to mention, making me a little envious. I once started a list of 'other people's patterns that I wish I'd thought of first', only to find that nearly all of them were Pat's. She managed to combine quirky, clever and colourful in every one and then rounded them off with a witty name. Just have a browse through her designs here and you'll see what I mean.To me, Pat was a mentor. When I started designing, she was always there to encourage and help; I've lost count of the number of times she had to patiently talk me through the technicalities when I was new to ravelry. She was the one who suggested that we start a Frankie's Knitted Stuff ravelry group and would always step in to cover for me there if I was away or ill. People there will remember her sense of humour and her kindness to one and all.We only met once, at a ravelry day in Coventry years ago - remember that? - but I feel that I have lost a good friend. I shall miss her.Tomorrow I shall follow Pat's funeral service online. If  anyone else would like to do the same, here are the details:The live feed for the service can be accessed at watch.obitus.com You will need these details to follow the service:Username tema5825Password 592014The funeral is at 1.30 UK time; here is the time for other parts of the world:5:30 am Pacific8:30 am Eastern12:30 UTC14:30 Central EuropeThere will also be a recording of the funeral, available after a few days.If anyone would like to make a donation in memory of Pat, her family have asked for contributions to her Woolly Thoughts for Kidney Research fundraising page. Pat had a kidney transplant many years ago so this was a cause close to her heart.It would be nice if her many friends and supporters around the world could come together to show the family just how much she meant to us all."},
{"title": "Buying in Bulk", "date": "Wednesday 7 July 2021", "text": "You know how Wool Warehouse sends their yarn in organza bags? Am I the only one who is building up a collection of the huge size? I only seem to be able to order yarn in large quantities. This was the latest arrival.Just a few things to be going on with.Do you want to see what I got? First of all, here are the three new shades of Stylecraft Special DK which bring the total number up to 100.From left to right they are Gingerbread, A Hint of Silver and Warm Grey. Not the most exciting of colours but I like to keep my stock up to date. If my Errand Boy ever gets round to doing my Hobbycraft shopping for me, I might have a use for the Gingerbread shade. One of the things on the list is more polystyrene wreaths in smaller sizes as I want to design a new Christmas wreath.The next collection of yarn is also new, the complete range of King Cole Bramble DK which, luckily, only comes in six shades.This is a colour changing yarn with what looks like a long colour run and I was very taken with the shades (and the names, obviously). My favourites are probably the three darker colours: Mixed Berries, Raspberry and Loganberry.I think there are some interesting possibilities by pairing dark and light shades too though. Look at these two together, Loganberry and Haze.I don't know what I'm going to do with these yet; I shall have to have a little play. What else did I get? Four balls of Stylecraft Special in Cream - not very exciting again but these are for the background to the crochet Butterfly Baby Blanket I'm working on.The butterflies are going to be worked in a range of pretty colours - hence the colour pegs in the picture.The last collection of yarn in my order was some Scheepjes Stone Washed in five colours to try out an idea for a patchwork blanket that I've had.The idea is to knit large blocks, made up of different textured squares. I chose the colours from the squares I knitted with the Stone Washed colour pack and which have yet to be turned into anything. I wrote about this a while ago in a blog post called Cataloguing Colours.Anyway, I'm designing one patch a day (there will be seven to a block) and this is what I've got so far.I particularly like the stitch I've used for the cream patch. It's called Rosette Stitch and I found it in one of the Barbara Walker Treasuries. As she says, it looks rather like crochet and the other side is pretty too.So, that's the lot. From that order anyway. No doubt I shall need some more before long."},
{"title": "In the Garden", "date": "Monday 28 June 2021", "text": "My garden is currently a very soggy jungle as I'm waiting for the Ox-Eye Daisies to finish so that the grass can have its first cut of the year. When my daughter was here a few weeks ago, the sun shone bightly and we spent lots of time outdoors. Having invested in a new, corded hedge trimmer, she was the lucky person who got to try it out first (I resisted the temptation to shout \"don't cut the lead!\" continually as she worked). This is how my much overgrown hedge ended up.Can you spot the deliberate mistake? She was all set to cut off the last bit of the top when she spotted a nest. There's a blackbird's nest just below the sticky up bit and there were chicks in it. Which would explain why these two were watching the hedge trimming so keenly.This is Mrs Blackbird on the bay window just outside my bedroom window. You will see that I had the window open a bit; I thought that was a small enough gap to keep the cats in ... until I found Tolly halfway to the nest the next day. Luckily, he's a very obedient cat; I just had to say \"Tolly!\" in a stern voice for him to turn round and come back in. Here's Mr Blackbird anxiously watching the nest too.Rose beat a hasty retreat indoors so that they could get back to their babies which they did at once. You can't really make it out in this photo but the nest was full of little fluffy nestlings.They've fledged now so I think it's probably safe to finish cutting the hedge. I was very tempted to put up a sign saying \"no, it's not an attempt at topiary\" as it looks so daft.Meanwhile, the cats have been making the most of the long grass in the back garden. Linnet has made herself a nest; you only see her when you get right next to it.As she doesn't really approve of Tolly, he's not allowed to share her nest so he made his own.There he is, curled up on a patch of old honeysuckle sticks which can hardly be comfortable. It gets worse though. Look at this ...Yes, that's a stick poking him in the eye and yes, he's fast asleep. He really is the dimmest cat I've ever known.While Rose was here we started the last of our seasonal cross stitch samplers. It's the first time that we've worked on them in the same place.Mine is on the left and Rose's is the one on blue fabric.Since then, we've both done lots more on our Summer Samplers. I'm enjoying working on this one much more than the Winter and Spring ones for some reason. I really like the colours and there's lots of variety. Here's what I've done so far ...Rose is coming again next month so we'll be able to compare our progress then. Meanwhile, I've just bought a chart for another big cross stitch project - Jane's Joy by Carolyn Manning, one of a collection of designs inspired by the Dear Jane quilt. I'm not quite sure when I'm going to start this but I just couldn't resist it."},
{"title": "Knitted Boxes", "date": "Monday 21 June 2021", "text": "I am very partial to geometric shapes so my latest knitting project, Square Nesting Boxes, was right up my street. A set of five nesting boxes, lined with plastic canvas so that they keep their shape.As with most of my work now, this one ended up taking much longer than it should have done. I make lots more mistakes than I used to and it takes me a lot longer to realise where I'm going wrong. The tricky bit about designing a set of boxes like these is to adjust the height of each box so that, when they're all together, the tops are level. It took me a long, long time to realise that I had to trust the number patterns in my knitting, rather than the measurements.There's a temptation to stick to the tension too rigidly, thinking that 'must' give you the size you want. This led to me having to completely re-knit the green box. Once I just followed the numbers, everything worked, even though normal knitting rules suggested it wouldn't.Have I lost you? What I'm talking about is the difficulty of taming a flexible material - knitting - to make inflexible shapes. It dawned on me that, as long as the plastic canvas pieces were the right size and the knitting covered them, it didn't matter if the knitting had to stretch more or less, depending on the box. If you study the pattern, you'll see that the number of stitches for each size and the number of rows to be worked increase in a regular way. It all looks so simple but it took ages for the penny to drop.Anyway, enough of that. Once I'd worked out how to get the sizes right, I enjoyed knitting these. I used a slipped stitch rib which is easily learnt and gives the boxes a nice touch of texture, as well as covering the plastic well.It's nice, portable knitting that doesn't require too much concentration and completing each box is very satisfying. I chose the colours as I went along, following the order of the rainbow but picking shades that I thought would go well with the other boxes. As ever, I used Stylecraft Special DK for my boxes; the colours are Lipstick, Spice, Dandelion, Apple and Lapiz.As normal, I had a lot of fun arranging the finished boxes for photos. Oh look, it's a leaning tower ...You can use them as lids for each other too, although they make rather chunky lids. Still, this might be useful if you want to knit them as gift boxes.They hold a surprising amount of crafty stuff which, of course, is what I shall use mine for.I decided to call them 'Square Nesting Boxes', rather than just plain old 'Nesting Boxes' to leave my options open. I may try a rectangular set and, if I can get circles of 10 holes per inch plastic canvas, round ones. In the meantime, have fun with the pattern."},
{"title": "Spring Samplers", "date": "Friday 4 June 2021", "text": "Another season, another cross stitch sampler. Rose and I have finished our Spring Samplers.That's Rose's on the left on pale blue, 32 count linen; I used a darkish cream 16 count Aida. We both had a lot of trouble choosing fabric for this design as there were so many colours that needed to show up on it. I'm not quite sure how many different blues Rose tried but, suffice to say, she'll be cross stitching on blue for quite a while. I had to change the white and one of the yellows for brighter shades to get them to show up against the cream (it's paler than it looks in that picture) and, even then, I wasn't too sure about it.We got there in the end though. As is traditional, Rose ran out of thread for the border - the same green that we both ran out of last time - and I had to rush to get mine done before the end of the three months we set ourselves for each sampler.The saga of me trying to sign my sampler in a straight line also carries on. With the Autumn Sampler, I dropped down a line half way through. I thought I'd got it right last time but, looking at it again, the '2021' isn't in line with the rest. Let's hope it's third time lucky. What do you think? Is it straight this time?Would you like a closer look at my Spring Sampelr? This design is bursting with colour and full of little details.Rabbits, birds and lots of flowers; those little purple ones remind me of Heart's Ease, the wild pansy and I had marmalade colour tulips like that in my garden this Spring. I thought the rain clouds and umbrellas were particularly apt as it rained throughout May here (which means my garden is now officially a jungle for cats again.There are also sheep scattered here and there in the scene; my favourite is the one balanced on top of a hill, all on his own.Here are my first three samplers all together. Don't they look good?We're all ready to start our Summer Samplers now. Rose is coming to visit me next weekend - I can't wait! - so we're looking forward to being able to work on them together. I have to say, I'm quite relieved that I don't have to finish this one in three months. As it's the last in the series, it only has to be done in time to hang it up next year. While Rose is here we're planning to choose and order our sets of frames so that we're all set to hang the Autumn ones up at the start of September."},
{"title": "Lazy Crochet", "date": "Wednesday 26 May 2021", "text": "After dealing with the complexities of the Primrose Garden blanket, I felt the need to do some simple crochet. This is what I came up with ...This is the v stitch pattern, normally worked in one row stripes. Isn't it pretty? Now, I don't normally mind sewing in lots of ends with crochet but it struck me that there'd be an awful lot of ends on a scarf. So, I put my mind to working out how to avoid them and came up with my lazy crochet technique. Basically, you work two rows in the same direction, one in each colour, before turning the work and crocheting the next two rows. I used a plain colour for my main yarn and a variegated for the contrast but, even if you changed the contrast colour every row, you'd still have cut down the number of ends by half.First of all I knitted this scarf, using navy DK weight yarn and some Lion Brand Mandala in a shade called Gnome. This is made up of eye-wateringly bright colours which I wasn't that keen on but pairing them with the dark blue has toned them down nicely.The finished scarf is edged with a simple border in the main colour which evens up the sides. You can download the pattern from ravelry as normal. Lazy Vee Scarf.It didn't take long to crochet this scarf so I then thought I'd try a completely different colourway, using the same technique to make a blanket.I used a bigger hook for this project so the fabric has a softer drape. The two yarns I used were both from Stylecraft: Cream Batik for the main colour and Rainbow Batik Swirl for the contrast. I think these colours give the blanket a soft, vintage feel.The blanket has a slightly more elaborate border than the scarf which you may or may not be able to see in this picture.The blanket is called Lazy Vee Blanket and can be found next to the scarf pattern in my Ravelry Shop - two patterns for the price of one (if you can say that when both patterns are free.I keep hard copies of all my patterns and these two finish off the 15th file. That's not counting all the big pattern series which have their own files.The fifteen pattern files are on the lower shelf; above them are all the big series and, at one end, my collection of pattern notebooks. My daughter is hoping to be able to visit me for a few days next month and I'm going to pick her Archivist brain about how to organise those notebooks. They are full of incomprehensible scribblings and random pieces of loose paper which only mean something to me (and not even that sometimes) so I'd like to sort them out a bit.According to ravelry, I have published 549 patterns in the last thirteen years or so. Blimey - how did that happen?"},
{"title": "Santa's House", "date": "Friday 21 May 2021", "text": "I've got another little house to show you this week and this one is even smaller than the last.I've just finished this little beaded house which is the first in a series of Christmas patterns from ThreadABead who sell patterns for the most wonderful range of 3D beaded creations. Have a look on their site - I can guarantee you'll be impressed. My little house is Santa's House and is just one of many patterns for a complete Christmas Village. There are all sorts of different houses and shops, a train (complete with station), Christmas trees, old-fashioned street lights, everything you could want.The patterns are full of lovely details; I'll give you a tour of mine to show you what I mean. There's a tiny wreath on the front door for starters.I like the candy cane stripes on the house corners too.Standing at one side of the house is Santa himself ...... while Mrs Claus is picking poinsettias in the garden.And of course there's a decorated Christmas tree on the other end wall.The finished house is tiny, as you can see from this picture of it next to my trusted thimble. This means that you could fit a whole village on a mantelpiece or shelf easily.I had a moment of panic just as I'd nearly finished the house when I realised it needed something to weight it down a bit. Now normally I would use a few coins from my purse but I haven't had any cash for over a year (no need for it when I can't get to any shops). Luckily I found a little pile of pennies and twopences in a ramekin in the kitchen cabinet - two pennies just fitted in the bottom of the house.I bought the pattern as a digital download and then ordered the beads that I needed. The patterns are long and detailed with every step illustrated by photos.The chart for the walls looks complicated but, actually, that's the part I enjoyed beading most. I've done beading before but I think a beginner could manage one of these little houses without too much difficulty. Just don't take any notice of how long they say each project will take; they suggested two hours for this one and I was barely halfway across the roof by then.Now one house doesn't make a village so I shall obviously have to make some more. I've already bought and printed off the next pattern.This one has two floors and is a workshop for the elves. It should keep me busy for a while. After this, I shall move on to the Reindeer Barn I think.Which reminds me ... I put quite a lot of links in my blog posts and wondered if you like them or not. Do you tend to follow them or have you not even noticed that there are links? Personally, I like being able to follow up on things that I'm reading in more detail. What about you?Now I'm going to put my little beaded house on the mantelpiece in solitary splendour - who cares that it's only May?"},
{"title": "House Building", "date": "Friday 7 May 2021", "text": "For the last year or so I've been slowly working on a project that started life as an awful lot of tiny pieces in some small plastic bags ...Here's what all those tiny pieces turned into ...This little house kit from Petite Properties is in 1:48 scale which means that it's pretty small. To give you some idea of scale, here it is with something lots of you will be familiar with - a 100g ball of yarn.For the non-knitters out there, the house is about 15 cm wide and tall and about 10 cm deep (6 x 4 inches). It's a proper little dolls house in miniature. Would you like a tour? Of course you would. At one side there's a small scullery ...... and this is the back of the cottage ...I particularly like the bay window and the little porch over the front door.To get to the rooms, the front wall and part of the roof comes off.I chose this particular house because I liked the stairs in the cupboard; I once lived in a house like that. There are tiny fireplaces in three of the rooms which I built fires in. I couldn't get a photo of them inside the rooms so here's one taken after I'd made it.At the back of one of the downstairs room, there's an open door showing just a glimpse of the scullery.The roof lifts off the scullery too so that you can see inside.This turned out to be the perfect long term project for me at the moment. Long Covid means that I struggle with anything that I have to concentrate on for too long but I could do a little bit of painting and leave it to dry, glue some pieces together ... As this was the first time I'd tried building a miniature house, I needed to take it very slowly anyway so that I could check and re-check what I had to do next.I made lots of mistakes and learnt an awful lot in the process. I'd paint a bit, then mess it up with the next bit - I was constantly touching up the paintwork. I nearly put the windows in back to front and had no end of trouble with the brickwork.I nearly didn't even try that brickwork but in the end I found a bit of wood to practice on and had a go. You plaster the outside walls with cheap filler (the expensive stuff dries too quickly and too hard) and then carve the lines of the bricks on it. I used a loom knitting tool for this.The carving was a very messy business - dust everywhere - and lots of the bricks crumbled as I worked. I decided that this would just look like wear and tear and left them like that. Once the bricks are all marked out, you paint the whole thing with the mortar colour and then sponge paint various brick shades on top.Isn't that clever? I saw Bea Broadwood from Petite Properties demonstrating this technique at the Miniature show I went to a few years ago and I'm so glad I finally managed to do it. Here are all the parts of my house covered in bricks.The chimneys were really tricky to do as they're so small. I realised afterwards that I could have stuck them on to something to give me something to hold. This is the sort of thing I put in my notebook which is full of things to remember another time - mostly because I did them wrong this time. Those windows shouldn't have been put in until after I'd done the brickwork for example. When I came to gluing the parts of the house together, I came up against another problem, how to hold the pieces at the right angles while the glue set. This is where Lego bricks turned out to be useful. I could rearrange them into props and supports for every task.See the days and the month on the bricks? That's because I dismantled my Lego calendar for this - April had to be cancelled this year.I was rather proud of my floorboards. I worked out a way of dry brushing, using various colours to paint my own. The cracks between boards and nail marks are pencilled lines.That floorboard recipe has gone down in my notebook too, complete with a sample on card so that I can do it again another time.The brickwork may have been time consuming but I found Bea's technique for the roof was simplicity itself. It consists of corrugated cardboard, covered with fine sand and then sponge painted. The ridges at the top are cocktail sticks.My corrugated card was bright yellow and I discovered that, with a thin coat of brown paint, it looked like an old rusty tin roof. I've made a note of that in case I ever want to make such a thing - a Shepherd's Hut perhaps?Now all I have to do is furnish my house. I'm going to buy the furniture as kits to make and paint myself and then I'd like to make someone to live in there ... Once I've done all that, I shall have to decide which house to build next. I'm torn between a house with a garden like Gardener's Cottage or The Little Duck House or something like Privet House which, with its mid twentieth century styling, would make a good 1940s house."},
{"title": "Another Day, Another Blanket", "date": "Monday 3 May 2021", "text": "After the relief of finally getting my Primrose Garden pattern published, I've got another blanket pattern ready for you today - this time a knitted one.This is Bestway Blanket, a  small baby blanket made up of single rib squares which are knitted in the round. I don't think I've ever worked rib stitches in the round before. I got the idea from this old knitting pattern in my collection.The bootees that particularly appealed to me were those yellow ones with the cuff. I tried knitting a pair and was very taken with the way that the rib pattern was shaped around the foot.Double decreases give a nice sharp line and the direction of the rib stitches adds to the geometric look. So, I got out my double pointed needles and, after several slightly odd squares, came up with this.The double decreases are worked halfway along each of the four needles, giving a nice raised chain along what becomes the diagonals of the finished square. I think the wrong side is pleasing too. I like the way that the rib stitches all 'point' towards the middle; you can also see in the first of the photos above how the lines of the rib catch the light slightly differently, depending on whether they run horizontally or vertically - another nice touch.In a 'let's use some of the stuff I've already got' mood, I turned out as many chalky pastel shades as I could find from my Stylecraft Special DK baskets and found that I had 15 different colours. I knitted two in each and sewed them together to make a small baby blanket.Each square takes about 10g of yarn so you need roughly 300g all together, plus another 50g or so for the attached I cord border. I'm pleased with how this one has turned out, especially as I don't often use paler shades like these. I think my 'new' First Love doll (yet to be named) likes it too.I just love making blankets. Having taken weeks to write up my latest crochet blanket because it was quite complex (20 pages!), I felt the need for some simple, soothing crochet. That's right, another blanket. I'm whizzing along with this one, having worked out a way of not having to keep cutting the yarn. Why didn't I think of that before? I'm using more Stylecraft yarn for this one, this time Batik in cream and the Rainbow colourway of  Batik Swirl."},
{"title": "Ladybirds", "date": "Wednesday 28 April 2021", "text": "No, not that sort ... I spotted these in the garden a few weeks ago - obviously some sort of ladybird party.The ladybirds I had in mind were these ...I'm particularly fond of this series of Ladybird books, which were first published in the late 1950s and early 1960s. With text by E L Grant Wilson and illustrations by Tunnicliffe, they are classic first Nature books.Knowing how much I liked them, my daughter bought me this set of new editions for Mother's Day last month.Aren't they lovely? When I first saw them, I thought it was just the covers that were different but they are completely new books, all illustrated by the artist Natasha Durley with text by Elizabeth Jenner. When you look at the two editions of the Spring book, you can see how much has changed - and how much has stayed the same.Although the treatment is different, some things feature in both books - Mad March hares for example.While the text in the older book runs continuously, the new version has separate short articles. All the illustrations in the original are set in the countryside, while the new book includes things that can be seen in towns and cities too.There is perhaps more information in the older book but the new one feels much more inclusive and varied. There is a page on shooting stars and another one on April showers; I particularly like the illustration for this one.Ladybird books have always been mini art books and this remains true with these new books. I also like the way that the naturalistic illustrations are interspersed with some more reminiscent of modern nature guides.These pages look so fresh and appealing after the originals.I love the old and the new series and would recommend them both. Every home should have them. In my Spring garden there is something new to see every day. Having always said I didn't like frilly tulips, I have been completely won over by these ...... and I have a new garden helper who keeps me company whenever I'm working out there.The robin is known as the Gardener's friend and this one was particularly interested when I was digging a hole for one of my new fruit bushes.The cats are also keen on the robin, although not in the same way as me. Tolly isn't bright enough to be able to catch it and I've told Linnet that if she kills my robin it's back to the cattery for her.Meanwhile, Rose and I are making progress with out Spring cross stitch samplers. Here's hers which shows you the top half of the picture.While, as normal, I'm stitching the bottom half first.I've got a row of tulips to work at the bottom before I can start on the top half but I'm finding cross stitch tires me out easily at the moment (along with just about everything else) so that'll take me a while."},
{"title": "Primrose Garden", "date": "Sunday 18 April 2021", "text": "In February 2019 I started working on an idea for a crochet blanket, inspired by Islamic tiled patterns. I experimented with various sizes of squares and long hexagons to start with ...... and then spent a very long time trying to choose a combination of colours to use ...I had a rough idea of the sort of stitch patterns I wanted to use but kept changing the details with every new set of colours.Finally, I decided it would be a Spring blanket and chose three shades each of green and yellow, with a very pale yellow for contrast. I wanted to use my trusty Stylecraft Special DK with its huge range of colours and it didn't take me long to settle on my yellows and greens.From left to right, they are Lime, Mustard, Citron, Lemon, Pistachio, Meadow and Cypress.The main part of the blanket is made up of a combination of squares and long hexagons. The squares are heavily textured; I had fun working out all sorts of effects for these.In contrast, the long hexagons are simpler, mostly rows of double crochet (US single crochet).It took me over a year to crochet all the squares and hexagons. Then came the fun part of sewing them together; this is when the whole thing started to take on a 3D look.It looks as if those four squares are lying on top of the bigger square but the whole thing is flat. Once all the shapes were joined together, I had to design and crochet 20 half hexagons to fill in the gaps round the edges and then add a border to finish off the blanket.I finished my blanket in the Spring of 2020 ... and then I got ill. So, I decided to put the blanket away and publish it the next Spring. Which brings us up to date.It turns out that it's very difficult writing a long and complex pattern a whole year after making it. Although I had lots of notes in my pattern notebook, it wasn't fresh in my mind and that made the whole process very laborious. Several months later, I finally had a 21 page draft pattern - 21 pages! Proofreading brought it down to 20 pages but even so ... Don't be put off by the length of the pattern though. There are lots of photos and a fair bit of repetition. I wanted to include as much information as possible to help the less experienced crocheters, thinking that the more advanced will just skip the bits they don't need.As with all my other patterns, you can download Primrose Garden free of charge from ravelry. As I write this, my garden is full of wild primroses so the timing seems just right, even if it is a year late. I look forward to seeing other people's versions of this blanket; changing the colour scheme would give it a whole new look."},
{"title": "Bits and Bobs", "date": "Tuesday 13 April 2021", "text": "This is the first week of my new 'activities timetable' which is not as exciting as it sounds. Basically, it's a way of trying to fit the essential things I have to do into a routine that puts as little stress on me as possible. One of the things on it is a regular lie down each afternoon; I don't realise just how tired I am until I stop. Other than that, it's a case of trying not to do too much of any one thing at a time, especially things that require a lot of concentration.So, here are some of the things I've been doing lately ...This is my Spring Sampler from Little Dove Designs. As normal, I've started in the middle and am working my way down while my daughter goes in the opposite direction.The colours are beautiful in this design and it's lovely to stitch.This, on the other hand, is the bane of my life at the moment ...I finished this crochet blanket which I'm calling 'Primrose Garden' a year ago but then was too ill to write it up and publish it. I thought I'd wait until this Spring and I've been slowly writing it over the past few weeks. It's a long pattern (21 pages) and it doesn't help that it's not fresh in my mind. I shall be so glad to get it finished; I just have to proofread the thing now - did I say 'just'? - it'll take me ages. While working on this pattern, I felt a great need for some simple crochet so I've also started this scarf.I'm still working on my quarter scale house from Petite Properties too. This has turned out to be an ideal long term project for me as you can only do little bits of painting or gluing before you have to leave it to dry or set. After much planning, I decided to try adding plaster brickwork to the outside walls which has turned out well.Now I'm slowly gluing it together. This means that my trusty Lego Calendar is currently in pieces so that I can use the bricks to hold the walls together.April will have to wait for a bit.What else have I been doing? Well, I've finished the last of these Bestway squares which are going to be a baby blanket.I've rather enjoyed using all those pastel, chalky shades that I don't often knit with for this project.The tiny doll I showed you a while ago is a bit nearer to having a dress too ...... and I've been sampling stitch patterns for a patchwork cushion project idea. Having to work slowly is making me do things with a bit more care. Normally, I would just dive into this, work non-stop and then, several days later, emerge either with a workable idea ... or not. Research and sampling is much slower but also safer.I'm enjoying my garden too. My walks have to be so short that, often, I do a bit of gardening instead for my exercise. New flowers are appearing every day and just look at the blossom on the plum tree. It had about six plums on it last year so I'm hoping for better things this year."},
{"title": "Spring Stitching", "date": "Friday 26 March 2021", "text": "As I write this, it's pouring with rain (of course it is) but the weather has been mostly sunny lately and Spring is definitely in the air. Which means it's time to start my Spring cross stitch sampler.As regular readers will know, my daughter and I are stitching seasonal samplers from Little Dove Designs. We started with the Autumn one last September so this is the third in the series. It looks like it will be a lot more stitching than the Winter one, what with everything having burst into bloom. I've started the line of purple flowers across the middle (primulas?). I'm ahead of Rose at the moment but I suspect she'll soon overtake me as I'm also working on two other embroidery projects and keep flitting between them. First, there's this Brambly Hedge embroidery kit from the 1980s that Rose gave me for my birthday.I'm using one of my new Q Snap Frames which is the perfect size for this little piece (this is the 8\" set). It's been a long time since I did any freestyle embroidery but I'm pleased with how it's going so far.I'm using my bigger set of clip frames for my other project which is quite a major undertaking.I discovered Blackwork Journey's Blog last Summer and enjoyed reading through all the back issues; they're in the form of pdfs, one for each month. The designer behind Blackwork Journey is Elizabeth Almond and she has the most wonderful patterns, including many free ones. She explores a variety of techniques and I was particularly drawn to the pulled thread work. So, my project is a big sampler that combines pulled thread work, blackwork, cross stitch and pattern darning stitches.It's called Pandora's Box and you can buy it as a pdf from the site or download the Free Instructions which were originally released as a Stitchalong. I bought the pattern which also includes tips and extra patterns as you go along - it's more than 100 pages which I thought was a bargain for £8.The first step was choosing which threads to use. As well as a thicker white thread for the pulled work, you need a solid colour and a variegated one from the same colour family and then a metallic thread and some beads. I ending up ordering enough for two colourways so that I could choose between them. The first one was a mixture of blue, turquoise and silver.In the end, I settle for these autumnal colours; I shall keep the blues for my next project.You can see my pulled work grid in the background to these pictures. Although all the counting was a bit nerve-wracking, this was such a lot of fun to stitch. Basically, you use a crochet cotton and pull the stitches tight as you go, creating patterns of holes. That's all there is to it. This stitch is called four sided stitch and gives you little crosses on the back of the fabric. Here's a close up view of the front ...And here's the whole grid ...Now I just have to fill all those little boxes with stitching. This is the pattern for the first five squares.The chart is the top row; the stitched squares are the row below. From left to right the patterns are: Blackwork, Assissi work (reverse cross stitch), Pulled Thread, Cross Stitch and more Blackwork. So far I've done the first three squares.Despite being only about two inches square, each design is quite detailed and takes a long time to work. That intricate blackwork square is like drawing with thread. When I was a child, I used to doodle in squared maths exercise books and those doodles were just like this sort of pattern. The firs two squares will eventually have gold beads too but I shall add those at the end. I got a bit carried away with the whole 'pull the stitches tight' thing on the third square and ended up distorting the fabric so I had to unpick it all and re-do it. This is a lovely project to work on gradually, enjoying the process as much as the finished thing. Each square takes me about two evenings to stitch (not counting unpicking).While all this stitching is going on inside the house, Spring is showing itself all round the garden too. There are primroses all over the place, mostly the pale yellow ones ...... but there are a few renegade coloured ones too ...The primroses are wild and just turn up where they feel like it but I have planted lots of daffodils too.That's the old sink from the scullery.It's not all random prettiness out there though. There's also this ...This is the honeysuckle that started life in next door's garden but decided it liked it better in mine so came over the wall years ago. It now only has roots in my garden and is determinedly trying to march across it to the other side. Not this year though. As you can see, I've been waging war with it recently and there's now a good three foot less of it. If you look closely in the picture above you can see some green wire mesh amongst it. My son and I found that last weekend, still attached to a fence post which had once presumably held it on top of the wall. We managed to cut out most of it (and the post) but the plant has grown through the mesh for decades so we'll have to leave some behind.As you can see, we had to cut off lots of its greenery; I'm hoping that it has time to grow some more this year. If not, it's going to be the highlight of my garden display all summer. The brown patch on the ground shows where it used to reach to. Oh and there's the post and meshing we got out from inside it, lying on the grass.Gardening - 50% planting, 50% destruction."},
{"title": "New Quilting Books", "date": "Wednesday 17 March 2021", "text": "A couple of weeks ago, while browsing through Kaleidoscope's online store, I inadvertently found myself buying three new quilting books. It could happen to anybody. Kaleidoscope are the bookseller who have the big stand at the Quilt Shows and they have a really good range of books. Want to see what I got?I've been having a lovely time looking through my new books and dreaming of future projects - there's never enough time for everything you want to make, is there?The first one is the latest book by Kathleen Tracy who is probably my favourite quilt designer; her love of reproduction fabrics, small quilts and history chimes perfectly with my own. I've made quite a few of her quilts over the years, including this little chessboard for my son.From 'Prairie Children and their Quilts'.This one was for my daughter's birthday earlier this year and is called 'Wagon Wheels'. I hand pieced it while looking after my Stepfather Bob last year and he thought it looked more like CDs.From 'A Praire Journey'.I added old photos printed on fabric to this one which was a present for my aunt. The pictures are of her and her brother and sisters.From 'The Civil War Sewing Circle'.This new book, Schoolgirl Sampler, is a bit of a departure from the others in that, instead of a collection of separate small quilts, it has 72 4\" blocks which can be combined to make one large quilt.Of course, you could also use the blocks to make smaller quilts and Kathleen provides seven patterns for these, just to get you started. I like this simple pinwheel quilt.And I'm a sucker for anything using bubblegum pink fabric.But of course most of the book is taken up with all those lovely blocks - so many to choose from.As ever, Kathleen writes about the history of sampler quilts and this is where I had my 'aha' moment. I had always assumed that people (historically, young girls) pieced different blocks together as a learning process and, although this was true, the blocks were often not made into quilts. Instead, they would be kept in a special box as a reference tool for future quilts. Before women had access to printed patterns and books, these collections of blocks would have been invaluable and would have been shown to and shared with others.At this point I remembered a reference in one of the Laura books to 'Mary's box of patchwork blocks'. I had always assumed that these were identical blocks intended for a quilt but now I wonder if this was just such a memory box as is referred to in the book. As fabric from home sewing was used for patchwork, the blocks would also have reminded women of the people who had worn the original clothes.A slight diversion here as this seems a good time to show you a book my daughter bought me recently.This is an American edition with illustrations by Helen Sewell. Here in England we are used to the Garth Williams editions so it was exciting to see something so different.Now of course I want to collect matching copies of all the other books. And then there are the lovely paperbacks with the colour illustrations by Garth Williams ...Anyway, I think I might just make blocks from this new book and then turn them into small quilts as and when the fancy takes me. Or should I turn them into my own memory book?The next of the new quilt books is something a bit different. Tabletop Turnabouts by Jan Patek is a series of small quilts designed to be hung from a stand. Each quilt has two picture blocks so that you can turn it round for a different look.Isn't that a clever idea? I particularly like this Christmas one.The 12\" blocks all use rough and ready style applique - very much my Mum's style which is what attracted me to the book I think. The Spring designs are lovely. Anyone for a bunny riding a chicken?Or you could make a chick pull the bunny along in a cart ...These remind me of the illustrations by Rosemary Wells - see what I mean?From 'My Very First Mother Goose'By the way, if anyone out there hasn't yet read Noisy Nora, go and find a copy now!The last of my three new books turned out to be very exciting. Simple Whatnots by Kim Diehl is absolutely packed full with small quilts I want to make right now, this very minute.This designer has such a good idea for colour; I'd seen her quilts here and there but have only ever made one of them I think.It's pretty but all that applique isn't really me. But it turns out that Kim also designs beautiful pieced quilts. My only problem is which one to make first. Hexagons?Little Houses?Pinwheels?More hexagons?And just look at this beautiful little Orange Peel quilt decorated with lots of french knots.There's some beautiful wool applique too, just using circles ... choices, choices.Before I start yet another new quilt though, I want to finish the partner quilt to go with this one.This is the quilt I made for Rose using half of the pile of half square triangles I pieced last year.Put two squares of fabric, one light and one dark together, draw a line across the diagonal and then sew a quarter of an inch from each side of this line. When you cut along the drawn line, you'll end up with two identical half square triangles. I thought I would use one half to make a little quilt for Rose and the other for me. They'll be different layouts so fraternal rather than identical twins.I think I'm going to lay mine out like this ...The finished quilt are just the right size to fit on those very useful folding tables. I see it's called a TV table, presumably so that you can eat at it while watching television. I don't have a TV but it's just the right size for my Singer Featherweight machine, or my laptop, or a pot of tea ... Rose doesn't actually have one of these tables yet - what with living in one of the smallest flats known to humankind - but that's a minor detail. When she does get one (as everyone does eventually) her quilt will be all ready for it."},
{"title": "Birthday Cards", "date": "Wednesday 10 March 2021", "text": "I spend quite a lot of time looking for, but not finding things. During one recent search, I came across some more old family cards and thought you might like to see them.These were amongst the cards my Mum kept and are birthday cards sent to my brother and I, many of them from each other.Stephen is the oldest so let's look at his cards first.There are three first birthday cards: the one in the middle from our Mum and Dad and the two others from his godparents.I particularly like this one which is actually a flat card, rather than one which opens.There's also this one celebrating his first Christmas which would have been December 1957. Who knew that you could buy 'Baby's First Christmas' cards more than sixty years ago? I would have guessed them to be a much more recent idea. This one is from Aunty Hazel (very nice card Hazel, if you're reading this).The next two cards are from me. I'm three years younger than Stephen so I wasn't quite ready to write in them myself.However, by the time Stephen was eight, I was ready to have a go ...And yes, that is random letters. I wanted to do 'proper writing' before I started school but Mum wouldn't teach me. She told me that, when I went to school, I could learn how to read and write. As I wasn't keen on starting school, this seemed like a good idea ... until I'd learnt to read and write and then thought I'd stay at home. The last of Stephen's cards is from his tenth birthday. We're now into the 1960s and the Apollo missions had led to lots of interest in Space. You only have to look at some of the chocolate bar names of the times - Mars, Milky Way, Galaxy ... So, Stephen's card featured pop out planets to attach in their proper places around the sun.At this point, I couldn't resist getting out this old picture of Stephen all dressed up in his home made Spaceman costume, ready for a party.Guess who felt left out?I've followed in the family tradition of home made fancy dress. I once dressed my daughter as Thomas the Tank Engine, complete with wheels and, somewhere, there's a photo of her as an Easter Egg.On to my old cards now.There's just one that I know was definitely for my first birthday in October 1961 and it's from Stephen.It's a very pretty card but I think he may have had some help signing it.The next two are also from him; I'd like to point out that in both of them it says 'from Stephen', not 'love from' - a proud tradition which he maintains to this day. Perhaps he doesn't feel he's known me long enough to add 'love'?Two of these cards would have had badges on; now that's something you still get on birthday cards.These are still cards that could be aimed at either boys or girls but, a few years later, my card are definitely girls' cards.Now I never aspired to be a ballet dancer (unlike my Mum who used to prance down the road in the hope that someone would say \"what a natural dancer, that child must have lessons\" - they never did) but I did wear an Alice band like the girl with the flowers.These last two cards are much more up my street.I loved my dolls (I still do) and many of my fondest memories involve them. I had some favourites who came everywhere with me. Here I am with Louby Lou on the steps of a holiday caravan ...And a few years later, outside another caravan with Susie and Tiny Tears ...My Mum used to make rag dolls and sell them. They were about half the size of Susy who was the only big one she made. She's one of the things I can't find; I know she's in the house somewhere but, so far, I've only found her pinafore and her petticoat. I just hope she's kept her bloomers on, she always was a rather naughty doll. Some time ago I managed to buy a copy of the doll pattern Mum used; one day I shall try making some myself."},
{"title": "Finished!", "date": "Wednesday 3 March 2021", "text": "I have finally finished my cross stitch Winter Sampler, one day before the end of February which was my deadline. My daughter and I are stitching each sampler during its season which gives us three months but Christmas distracted us with this one.I got nearly to the end last week and then ran out of one of the green threads for the border - the same shade Rose ran out of a few weeks ago. Luckily my thread order arrived on Saturday and, after a bit of hurried stitching, it was done.I even managed to sign it in a straight line this time (the date on the Autumn Sampler drops down a square). And here are my first two finished samplers.And here are Rose's, the same designs but stitched on linen with Anchor threads.We're going to wait for a couple of weeks before starting the next sampler in the series as we've got other projects to work on. I really wanted to get started on a big blackwork project from Blackwork Journey which I'm very excited about.I have sorted the threads out for my Spring Sampler though. As you'd expect, this one uses lots of colours; my little tin is brim full.Are there any other Belle and Boo fans reading this? I love these nostalgic designs of a little girl and her toy rabbit. This little tin is just right for holding threads for a project. Rose sent me another Belle and Boo tin in December which has to be the prettiest Christmas tin ever.It came full of homemade liebkuchen too which made it even more exciting. When I can cope with more complicated cooking (not to mention taste the results), I must ask her for the recipe."},
{"title": "Odd Designs", "date": "Monday 22 February 2021", "text": "I'd like to think that my designing is an ordered process, perhaps involving a pretty notebook or two and some carefully organised sketches. In an ideal world I'd drift artistically from one pattern to the next, always finishing one perfectly crafted project before starting another. Obviously, this is not how it works in real life. I have a big pile of scrappy notebooks (currently coming to the end of number 9) and bits of patterns are often scribbled down on a pile of post-its as I work. There's one such pile that's been waiting for weeks for me to transfer to my notebook.Then there's the question of order. I always have lots of projects on the go at once; sometimes they get left for years before I come back to them. If I get fed up with what I'm working on, I nearly always start another blanket.I thought you might like to see how this haphazard designing process has played out over the last month or so which has been pretty typical.First, I knitted a pair of my Walking Socks to send to a friend for Christmas. These use the padded stitch commonly used to reinforce sock heels for the foot which makes them thicker. It occurred to me that the same stitch would be useful to knit some warm mittens. As it was pretty cold here at the time, warmer mittens seemed like a good idea.Padded Mittens PatternThese didn't take that long to design as I just had to adapt my basic mitten pattern to allow for the padded stitch. Then I decided that it would be good to check that three different sizes of mittens could be knitted by varying the weight of yarn used. By the time I'd finished the last pair, I was getting fed up with knitting mittens. I'm pleased with the pattern though; the middle size fits me perfectly and, if it gets really cold, I can fit the biggest size over the top of them for double warmth.I'm trying to use up odd balls of yarn for patterns, rather than keep buying new and I thought that this yarn would make a nice matching cowl to go with my blue mittens.It's King Cole's Shadow Chunky which I'd bought with weaving in mind but thought would work well for a cowl.This is where all the planning started to unravel. I remembered that I wanted to use a slip stitch pattern but not that it was meant to be the same one I'd used for the mittens. So ... I spent an afternoon looking through various stitch dictionaries, followed by another session playing around with needles and ended up creating a new stitch pattern that was nothing like the padded stitch (it's not even a slip stitch).The next thing that went wrong was that the yarn didn't work for this new stitch pattern; I decided it needed to be a solid colour. I kept rooting through my store of yarn until I came up with a couple of old balls of Patons Diploma Gold DK in bright pink.So, I now had a different stitch pattern and a different weight and colour of yarn. I was still designing a cowl though so that was something. By this time I was starting to lose my enthusiasm for this project but I persevered. Here's the finished pink cowl which I've called Odd Stitch Cowl. The 'odd' refers to the fact that the twisted stitch used is worked on one thick and one thin needle. How exciting is that? Anybody? I take my excitement where I can get it.While I was knitting the cowl, it occurred to me that this new stitch pattern would be ideal for flannels or washcloths. I hardly ever knit with cotton but I have a basket full of  it, bought when I couldn't resist the bright colours. This second odd stitch pattern turned out well, even if I did have to knit another two cloths just to make prettier pictures.Odd Stitch Cloths PatternAt this point I remembered that I'd chosen that blue chunky yarn because it would match my blue mittens. No problem, I thought, I'll just knit myself another pair of mittens with the pink yarn. Yes, yet another pair ...Knitting the pink mittens made me finally remember that I was originally going to use the padded stitch for my cowl. so, it was back to the blue chunky yarn ...I must have knitted and unravelled this thing at least six times before getting it right. The padded heel stitch kept  making it curl and I fiddled around with the border for ages before realising that I needed to swap the heel stitch for close stitch. This is the garter stitch version of heel stitch so it lies flat. Another advantage of close stitch is that it's vertically more dense than heel stitch so this cowl will be super warm. It's nearly finished now so I've come full circle.Now you may have noticed someone sneaking into these photos ...This is what often happens when I try to stick to an ordered series of designs - something else keeps nagging at me that I really want to work on instead.  In this case it was a tiny doll. I have in mind a fit-in-your-hand size doll who could come with various clothes and perhaps a bag to carry her in ...I resisted the temptation to start work on this little doll for two reasons. First, I was determined to see the mittens and cowls thing through and, secondly, I didn't want to start on the doll and find that I couldn't do it. This happens to me a lot since being ill. It's one thing trying out an idea and not being able to make it work because it isn't possible, quite another to know that it's possible but too much for my Covid brain.So, I ignored the call for as long as I could but, in the end, I had to give in.Every stage of designing this little doll was hard work. There was a huge amount of knitting and re-knitting, even the arms and legs took ages. The hair was a nightmare and the face took hours to get right.She's only about 6\" tall and, despite all the difficulties, I'm pleased with her. I'd like to knit two more with different skin colours before I start on the clothes. Obviously, she had to have a pair of knickers before showing herself in public but the rest of the clothes are waiting until the need to design them becomes urgent.After all that, I think I need some nice gentle blanket knitting before I start on something new."},

Here it is, all signed and dated ...Isn't it lovely? I think I like this one even more than the autumn one. Here are her two (two!) finished samplers ...Meanwhile ... this is where I'd got to a few days ago.Since then, I've done a bit more on the house. There's a big snowy roof to stitch so I could be a while. That really is an awful photo; I'll take a better one next time. I'd like to finish it by the end of the month so that I'm ready for the Spring Sampler. These are such beautiful designs."},
{"title": "Jigsaws", "date": "Tuesday 9 February 2021", "text": "For a long time now my days have consisted of little bits of things. A bit of craft, a short walk, some simple cooking. If I do too much of anything, I feel more ill and have to lie down.  I've been doing a ten minute walk each day this year which doesn't sound much but it wipes me out. My fatigue has got much worse and now I've lost my taste again (it had only just started to come back). So ... I have to cut down the walks to see if that helps. Honestly, it takes me longer to put my shoes and coat on and take them off again than it does to do the actual walk.Ah well, such is life. One of the things I've been enjoying for the past month or so is doing jigsaw puzzles. I do about twenty minutes a day and progress is slow but the sense of achievement at finally finishing one is huge. My son and I started this 1,000 piece one over Christmas and, weeks later, I finally finished it.The finished puzzle is always a surprise to me. I don't look at the picture on the lid while I'm doing it and I never know what the bit I'm working on is going to be. The rest of the family will be saying \"you're doing the tree / girl / whatever\" but I'll just be looking at the colours and shapes. I only discover all the details once the puzzle is finished.After this one I got out my new Wentworth puzzle. For those of you that don't know them, Wentworth make traditional wooden jigsaws with strange shaped pieces which are hard to do but very satisfying. This is my latest one.It's called 'Starry River' and is by the artist Lisa Graa Jensen whose work I discovered by buying an earlier jigsaw of another one of her paintings. I think I may have to buy one of her prints to frame - if I can choose just one.As you can see, this is a 250 piece puzzle. That doesn't sound much but, in terms of difficulty, it's about the same as a normal 500 piece jigsaw. The other exciting thing about these puzzles is that they all have a number of 'whimsies', shaped pieces that fit in with the theme of the picture. With this one there were lots of woodland birds and animals.And here it is finished with all the whimsies in place.Today I've started a new 1,000 piece jigsaw that a friend gave me for Christmas. It's of a quilt shop so very appropriate for me.Lots of colours and patterns there. Today I managed to sort out the edge pieces and put a few together.It's a start ..."},
{"title": "Winter Sampler Progress", "date": "Tuesday 2 February 2021", "text": "My daughter and I are both enjoying working on this season's cross stitch samplers from Little Dove Designs. This designer is particularly good when it comes to choosing colours and those in the Winter Sampler are especially good - strong pastels which you wouldn't normally associate with Winter but which work well.This is what I've done so far ...As I did with the first sampler, I started in the middle and then worked downwards. I particularly like the teapot and the hot water bottles; the line underneath them looks just like a shelf with a decorative paper trim. I've got a couple more trees to stitch and a bird table before I can start on the big picture at the top.Rose works in the opposite direction to me, doing the top first.As you can see, she also leaves all the backstitch until last which accounts for the absence of any lettering. That line of tree trunks next to the skates will have branches eventually too. She's working much quicker than me (I know, I know, it's not a race), probably because I keep feeling sick tired and have to stop to lie down!This one seems a bit quicker to do than the Autumn one was, probably because there aren't so many little leaves to stitch; this is a good thing as we started so late. We have until the end of this month to finish and sort out our supplies for the Spring Sampler."},
{"title": "On the Kitchen Mantelpiece", "date": "Friday 29 January 2021", "text": "My house is an old, three storey Victorian terrace and it has fireplaces in seven of the rooms (that's actually most of them, it's not a mansion). I only light fires in one of them but the others look nice and, of course, they all have mantelpieces - ideal for displaying favourite things.The kitchen mantlepiece is higher than a small child which is handy as it means I don't notice the dust. It gets dusted only very occasionally.In the middle is an old clock which gains time steadily through the week, one of my many tea related cards and a small, china sheep (obviously).The rest of the mantelpiece is taken up with two of my favourite collections. First, there's my commemorative china.Most of these mugs were made to celebrate various royal occasions and a few are old family ones. I particularly like the mugs for the coronation that never was. These two were made for the coronation of Edward VIII in May 1937 ... who abdicated in 1936, less than a year after coming to the throne. Monarchs become King or Queen on the death of the previous monarch but are crowned later; let's face it, organising a coronation probably takes a while.The arrangements for Edward's coronation were kept in place for his brother Bertie who was crowned in May 1937, becoming George VI. Coronation Mugs for George VI and his Queen, ElizabethOur present queen, Elizabeth II was crowned in 1952; many children were given mugs like these to mark the occasion.More mugs were issued to mark various royal jubilees, such as the Silver Jubilee of George V and Queen Mary in 1935. She always looks rather cross in her pictures, I think.The next mug is the only black and white one I have and was given to me at school to mark the Queen's Silver Jubilee in 1977.In 2012 the Queen celebrated her Golden Jubilee so I had to buy new mugs to add to my collection.These both came from Whittards; the one on the left is a traditional mug but the other one is a bit more quirky. It shows the Queen drinking a nice cup of tea, flanked by her iconic corgi dogs.I also have one commemorative mug that doesn't mark a royal landmark but a national one - the First World War.And the commemorative china doesn't have to be mugs - or in fact china at all. I have an Edward VIII plate ...... and an Elizabeth II child's teapot ...One day I hope to find more pieces from this lovely little tea set. This little tin beaker is from George V's Silver Jubilee in 1935 ...... and here is my Granny's coronation pyrex dish (she did like her pyrex).I even have a coronation spoon in my tea caddy which you may or may not be able to see in this photo.So, back to my kitchen mantelpiece. At the other end from the china is my collection of tin money boxes in the shape of post boxes.Did anyone else have one of these? These two belonged to my brother and I; I think mine is the smaller one.For those of you outside the UK, the 'ER' stands for Elizabeth Regina with the 'II' showing that she is the second Queen Elizabeth. On the backs of the tins are these two jolly figures.Most of the rest of my collection are older than these (which date from the 1960s).  These are small, basic ones; the one on the left is the oldest.These two look like the big, double post boxes you get on city streets.The older one looks like it would originally have had a key to lock it and the 'GR' (George Rex) shows that it dates from earlier than 1952. Both of these have interesting backs too.They both have the letters of the alphabet on them, while the older one has a picture of Dick Whittington and his cat. I particularly like the list of coins on the newer one; who remembers those? There were threepenny bits too and half crowns. When I was at primary school, we had lists like this on the back covers of our exercise books so that we learned essential facts such as how many chains there were in a furlong. England's currency went decimal in 1971 and metric measurements followed, although many people still refer to 'real' measurements (especially when asking how much a new baby weighs).  I still use Imperial measurements for most things, except for yarn which I've got used to in grams.The last three money boxes are smaller versions of these oval ones.The one in the middle even has a picture of the King (George VI) on the back.There are just two more things on my kitchen mantelpiece, the biscuit barrel given to my Grandparents when they married in 1935 and a small model of a yellow 2CV car.More than thirty years ago, we had a car just like that. It was great. You could take out the back seats and take the roof off to fit more in (we once carried a fireplace home from the Old Kent Road like that) and the window folded up to open. You couldn't listen to the radio if you were doing more than thirty miles an hour as it was so noisy but, when you met other 2CVs, you would wave to each other. We sold the car when we decided we couldn't afford a baby and a car but I've kept the little model ever since."},
{"title": "Winter Sampler", "date": "Monday 25 January 2021", "text": "Do you remember the Autumn Samplers my daughter and I stitched a few months ago? Here's my finished one.It's part of a four part series of seasonal samplers from Little Dove Designs and we plan to stitch them all. The idea is that we work on each one during the appropriate season so that we're ready to frame and hang them all by next autumn.The first one went well but then circumstances conspired against us with the Winter one. For a start, Christmas was looming and we both had lots of other crafting that needed to be done first. I had a Christmas box to stitch for Rose's stocking ...... and she had Kipper felt ornaments to make for me and her brother ...This is a new Christmas tradition. Each year Rose designs and makes us a felt ornament of a character from Children's Literature. Last year we got two - well, you can't really separate Oliver and Amanda Pig, can you?Anyway, back to the cross stitch. There was also the problem of choosing the fabric for our Winter Samplers. There's quite a lot of white on them and this wouldn't show up on lots of colours. After an encounter with some unpleasant Spearmint Aida, I settled on a pale grey but Rose tried all sorts before finally deciding to use the same colour she used for her Autumn Sampler.So, better late than never, we have started our new samplers. Rose is winning so far. I know, it's not a competition ...I may not have done as much but I've put my pretty thread tin in the picture to make up for it.As before, Rose is using Anchor threads and 32 count linen while I'm stitching with DMC threads and 16 count Aida. I really enjoyed working on this yesterday afternoon, even if I did have to lie down afterwards to recover from all that concentration. I am a feeble creature.You can see the current sampler at Little Dove Designs. Winter is my favourite season so this one is going to be lovely to stitch."},
{"title": "Taking It Slowly", "date": "Sunday 10 January 2021", "text": "Taking it slowly pretty much sums up my life for the past eight months. Living with Long Covid means that every single task has to be broken down into small stages which can be tackled one at a time with rests in between. I'm trying to incorporate this approach into my designing too in the hope that I'll be able to still publish new patterns albeit less frequently than before. Here's an example of this ...... one not very exciting mitten.While knitting a pair of my walking socks as a Christmas present, I thought that the padded heel stitch would make a nice warm mitten. Now normally, I could design this sort of thing in a couple of days of solid work. This single mitten has taken me a week; I did the cuff one day, the thumb gusset the next, then the thumb ... Now all I have to do is knit the left hand mitten. I want to use two other thicknesses of yarn to see if the same pattern can be used for different sized mittens too (that chunky yarn is a possible for the bigger size).As you can see, starting from scratch with a new pattern takes quite a while. The actual designing process is much harder than it used to be too. The ideas are still there but working out the maths is much slower now. So, I'm doing a mixture of new, very simple patterns and reviving some unfinished projects where I've already done the bulk of designing.I do like those workbags in the picture. The red one came from a charity shop for a few pounds and the pastel one I made with some fabric my daughter gave me. Before getting ill last year, I was working on a crochet workbag in this style - that's another project I could revive.Anyway, let's look inside those bags first. The red one holds a pile of simple knitted squares for a  blanket.I'm using two shades of King Cole Riot DK and cream Sirdar Snuggly, both of which are very soft yarns which catch on winter hands. Luckily, I got some satsuma hand cream in my Christmas stocking which I can even smell sometimes (my sense of smell and taste is coming back, albeit in rather erratic patches). This is lovely, simple knitting as it's only garter stitch so I can work on this even when I'm feeling bad.The other workbag holds a new lace knitting project which is the opposite of simple. First of all, I had to wind the yarn into a ball ...It was a 100g skein of thin wool so just winding it was enough for one day. Then it took me days and days to work out the stitch pattern. I kept making mistakes with calculating how many stitches I needed to make the pattern fit and then I decided to re-arrange the stitches ... Eventually, it was done and safely written down in my notebook.It's an eight row pattern repeat and not actually that difficult to knit but it does require counting up to five so I only manage one set of eight rows at a time. This could take a while to finish. I really like the look of this stitch pattern though; here are the two sides, both of which I think look nice.Going back to the collection of projects - I'll give you the photo again to save you scrolling back - the pastel squares underneath are going to be another blanket.These are knitted in the round using a rib pattern in fifteen different shades of Stylecraft Special DK. I tend to favour bright colours so it's been a nice change using the paler shades that I normally ignore. I'm halfway through this project so it's not going too badly.Those tiny crochet squares are but a small part of what will be a mammoth project, inspired by the yarn advent calendar given to me by a friend.It will be called 'The Power of Two' and involves more than a thousand two inch squares, half of which will be plain cream. As it's much more fun to work with variegated yarn than plain - tell me that's not just me - I'm going to make myself alternate between the two. Unfortunately, that means some catching up; I have to crochet 125 cream squares now. This is another one of my patterns influenced by maths, thanks to my mathematician son who explains it all to me.As if one project involving lots of tiny pieces wasn't enough, I've also been working on my never-ending Folded Flowers project.This started with another yarn advent calendar several years ago and I've been working on it more off than on ever since. The actual knitting is very simple and, over Christmas, I finally finished all the dark grey squares which were boring to knit. Now I just have to knit the rest of the coloured ones, only 39 to go.These make lovely patterns when folded into flowers.When they're all done, the plan is to turn them into a padded blanket for the top of the blanket box at the foot of my bed which will fold into its own cushion. Not quite sure how I'm going to make that happen but I'll cross that bridge when I get to it.So ... this is how I manage to keep working, one stitch at a time and lots of rests in between. It's nice to see something completed every day, even if it is only a small knitted or crocheted square. For the same reason, I'm very much enjoying doing jigsaw puzzles too. My son and I did a 1,000 piece one over Christmas; he's much quicker than me so he was rationed as to how much he could do at one time. I'm now doing a 500 piece one on my own and the time I spend working on it each day is one of the best bits of my day.Luckily, I have a puzzle board so it can be put away under the settee after every session. Jigsaws and cats are not a good combination. Apart from Tollys tendency to take a flying leap on to the coffee table, there's that similarity between a box full of little pieces and a litter tray ... doesn't bear thinkinbg about, does it?"},
{"title": "Christmas Quilts", "date": "Tuesday 29 December 2020", "text": "Today I'm going to show you some of my Mum's Christmas quilts. She took up quilting when she retired and spent much of her time making quilts; some were sold to raise money for charity and some were given away but we still have a huge pile of them. Most of the Christmas quilts are small ones, made to hang on the wall.First of all, there's the big Christmas quilt that she made for us when we first moved into this house. The fireplace in the middle is the one in our kitchen.Here's a close up of that central panel. The stove is still there but the blue kettle wore out years ago.The centre is surrounded with applique blocks with a festive theme. There's another Father Christmas ...... several different snowmen ...... and, of course, lots of angels ...Angels appear in a lot of Mum's quilts and they're nearly always of the homely variety, like this one with her cat angel or the flying angel, complete with basket.The next border is made up of a combination of Christmas tree fabric and panels showing the Twelve Days of Christmas before the whole thing is surrounded with some holly fabric.This quilt is on the coffee table in the front room this Christmas, much to the delight of the two cats. Linnet sits under the table and Tolly tries to get at her from outside until he catches his claw in the quilt and pulls it off the table - normally on top of Linnet. It's a game that neither of them has got tired of yet.The next quilt features a Christmas tree appliqued on top of a pieced background.In this picture you can see how some of the decorations are cut out of patterned fabric to make use of the images.This little quilt is a Christmas Sampler made using foundation piecing. This involves machine stitching over a paper pattern which is later torn away. It's a good technique for getting very accurate shapes, even at a small scale like this.These flying geese blocks are only about an inch across and would be very difficult to piece accurately without using a foundation.I like the way she's used patterned fabric to supply the face for this Father Christmas ...... and the spiral on this star shows that you don't just have to follow the pieced shapes when it comes to quilting ...Each block is set against red and green frames and then the whole quilt has a wide border. I like the little pieced corners too.The next quilt was always very popular with the children as it has lots of little pockets (the red squares) to hold chocolate.Mum used to get chocolate Father Christmases to peep out of each pocket until they made them bigger. From then on, they had to go in the pockets head first! That border is the fabric she used for lots of her Father Christmas faces, including twice on this quilt.Can you see the reindeer quilted behind the first one?Another pre-printed panel of 'The Twelve Days of Christmas' was used for this next quilt, with some of the words quilted in the middle.The angels in this quilt are unusually traditional for Mum - no hair for a start. For that reason we've always called this quilt 'Chemo Angels'.The following two quilts are stained glass in fabric form, first a Christmas robin ...... and then a candle ...This one was actually made for us and is hanging where I can see it as I write this.Finally, I thought I'd show you two tiny Christmas quilts. The first one is about six inches square and is decorated with buttons and beads.And then there's the quilted Christmas card ...Mum made quite a few of these little fabric postcards, always featuring one of her trademark, deliberately bad poems. As you can see, this one has a knitting theme.I've got more of these postcard quilts somewhere that I can show you another day. Mum also made me a new patchwork stocking every year ..."},
{"title": "Christmas Wreath", "date": "Tuesday 22 December 2020", "text": "Every year for the past ten years or so I've prepared a big Christmas series of patterns to be released during December. I started with my Advent Garland and, since then, there have been trees, a Gingerbread House and more than one Christmassy scene.Not this year though. I normally start work on the big Christmas pattern in March and, having been ill since April, that obviously wasn't going to happen in 2020. Instead, members of my ravelry group have been sharing their progress on various Christmas projects, often ones which have been languishing unfinished for a while.For a long time I've thought it would be nice to knit a more Christmassy version of my Woodland Wreath, which I originally intended to be a celebration of Autumn rather than Christmas.I still like this wreath (it's hanging on my front door at the moment) but I hankered for something a bit more festive. So, I set out to knit a Christmas wreath, using some of my existing patterns.To start with, it was straightforward. I covered the polystyrene wreath with knitting and added lots of layers of leaves. I didn't knit the oak leaves (too autumnal) and used plain green leaves with embroidered flowers to represent the Irish Ivy in my garden.Then there were the holly leaves and the mistletoe, followed by fir cones and toadstools.I was pleased with the toadstools; often I go back to old patterns and am disappointed but these have stood the test of time well, I think.At this point, it started to get difficult. The next two sets of ornaments I added were Santas and snowmen, both of which proved too fiddly for my tired Covid brain. They each involved quite a few changes of colour plus beads which meant finding all the bits, putting them all together, tidying up afterwards ... too many things to think of at once. I nearly gave up at this point but I'm glad I didn't.I think there should be another snowman but I just couldn't face making another one.Once these were done, the end was in sight. The last two sets of ornaments were wrapped presents (just knitted squares) and little stars. I was so glad to get it finished. I would have done a happy dance after sewing the final star to the wreath but that would have just made me feel worse.So, here it is - one Christmas wreath.I had planned to add a string of lights to it once I'd finished the knitting but decided that the lights took away from the knitting too much. what do you think?Anyway, I now have a festive wreath, as well as the original.I don't think I've exhausted the potential for knitted wreaths yet. I've already designed a Springtime Wreath and one with a Seaside theme so that's the four seasons covered. Next, I think I'd like to work on one featuring festive food and drink; I envisage this one as a mini wreath, about half the size of the others.In the meantime, I've been struggling with a crochet version of the little knitted mini stockings that I've been making for years. I thought this would be a quick design but it turns out that crocheting something foot shaped is harder than knitting - or maybe I'm just not very good at crochet. The hardest parts were the heel and the cuff. I think this one looks all right but I need to make some more to test a few details. I'm hoping that by next Christmas the pattern might be ready to publish."},
{"title": "Calendars from the Past", "date": "Wednesday 9 December 2020", "text": "My last post about Advent Calendars got me remembering other advents when the children were small. So, with the help of my daughter (who has scans of all our old photos), I thought I'd show you a few of those memories.To start with, here's Jack at a year old in 1988, studying his first picture advent calendar.He looks like he's taking it very seriously, doesn't he? And blimey, how young I look there. Look at this one - obviously taken just after getting that pesky little door open.By the next year, when he was two, I'd made him his own special calendar, thanks to a pattern in 'Prima' magazine (does anyone else have fond memories of the Prima patterns?)Over thirty years later, we still hang this calendar up every year but it no longer has little parcels wrapped in gold paper in the pockets.Then there was the gold coin calendar which both children remember very fondly. I got the idea from a Christmas craft book; here's Jack painting it when we made it the Christmas he was four.It's basically a stick from the garden 'planted' in plaster of paris in a flower pot and then painted white and sprinkled with glitter. You hang numbered chocolate coins from the branches, one for each day in advent. Here's Jack with the tree in 1992.Rose had been born earlier that year but was too young for chocolate coins but, don't worry, I soon had to start hanging two sets of coins from the branches. Rose's special advent calendar is a cross stitch one from a pattern by Jo Verso. Here she is, waiting for her little parcel in 1993.I'm not sure a not quite two year old should have been standing on a chair.There was a different cross stitched picture under each parcel. As you can see, the chocolate coin tree was still very much in use. I notice my collection of 'Creative Hands' magazines on the shelf too. I still have those craft magazines. It's nice to remember those times. Meanwhile ... my yarn advent calendar is coming along nicely. The mini skeins are obviously following a colour order as there's been an awful lot of pink. Today's colour is a blueish grey though so maybe blue will be next. The latest shade is called 'Good Fairy' and came complete with a fairy charm.I'm crocheting five little two inch squares from each skein and then using up the rest to make a 'round thing'. This is particularly liberating as I'm just making it up as I go along. It's nice not to always be in 'designer mode'."},
{"title": "Advent", "date": "Tuesday 1 December 2020", "text": "I love advent calendars. Home made ones, edible ones, craft ones ... there's always a risk that I will spend most of every day in December opening them. I hadn't got round to sorting one out this year, what with getting through each day being more than enough to think about. Luckily for me, other people came to my rescue.First my daughter sent me this beautiful calendar.It's a 3D Toy Shop, designed by Emily Sutton, one of my favourite artists. It's in pride of place on the bureau in my bedroom where I'm hoping the cats won't be able to get to it. I have a soft spot for picture advent calendars as that's what I had as a child. I remember sharing one with my brother. What I don't remember though is having trouble finding the numbers. Nowadays it takes me ages to find the number each day. Today's little door was on the back of the shop in the basket of a bicycle.Rose and I compare notes on the pictures on our calendars each day which is nice too. Hers was a fox on skis today (of course it was).The big excitement this advent though has been this intriguing parcel which arrived a few weeks ago.As instructed, I opened it yesterday and look what I found ...A very kind friend on ravelry has sent me a yarn advent calendar from Henny Penny Makes. Do you want to see inside?24 little striped sweet shop bags, each with a skein of hand dyed 4 ply yarn. I hadn't heard of this dyer before so I'm very excited to discover her. Oh the excitement when I opened the first bag this morning ...Each mini skein weights 10g and the colours are all inspired by pantomimes. This one - a lovely blend of silvery grey with a dusting of pink - is called 'Glass Slipper'. I think I might punch a hole in the little cards and thread a length of each colour through so that they will serve as a shade card.Can  you see the little stitch marker at the bottom of the picture? That was a lovely surprise. I had two with the original parcel but wasn't expecting more. This one is a bauble with multi-coloured star confetti inside. Here it is with the other two.I think these are too nice just to use as stitch markers so I shall probably turn them into jewellery. What do you think?Of course, I couldn't resist playing with my new yarn as soon as I'd got it so I wound it into a ball and crocheted a little square.I liked the idea of using each day's yarn but didn't want to commit myself to anything too time consuming. So, that little square is only 6 cm across - I can make more on days when I'm up to it and just one when I'm not. No idea what I shall turn the little squares into yet but I'm sure an idea will evolve as I go along.As well as all this new advent treasure, I've also fished out my old Advent Stars to hang up each day. These are a really easy calendar as I just hook them over the rails above my scullery windows and they're done. Here's the first one in a truly dreadful photo.Here are all the stars in a much better light.This evening I shall light the first of my advent candles too. I used to buy those special marked candles where you burn so much each day but they proved too traumatic for me. I was always burning two days at once by mistake (or missing days). Now I just use tealights. One lasts just about the right amount of time and it doesn't matter if I miss a day.I wonder if I should go and crochet another square ..."},
{"title": "A Dragon and a Sunflower", "date": "Thursday 12 November 2020", "text": "For a long time now I've been wanting to share some of my Mum's quilts with you. She took up quilting when she retired and left us a beautiful collection of work. Many of her quilts were her own design and all of them were hand quilted. Most of the quilts are in her old house and I don't have photos of them so, for the time being, I'll show you just two. First of all, her dragon quilt.As with all her quilts, this one was hand appliqued, machine pieced and then hand quilted. Often Mum would take her applique out and about with her to do when she and Bob went for picnics; she saved the quilting to do in her armchair while watching TV.The dragon quilt was made for my son Jack when he was 17 and, for once, she added a label.I was always trying to get her to sign her quilts like this but she didn't often bother.Looking through her old computer files today, I found her original sketch for the dragon too - I don't know why some lines are missing..Mum's quilting always reflected the theme of the quilt so this one included a fantasy castle which I'm hoping shows up in this picture.The other quilt I want to show you today is Mum's sunflower quilt. This one is also labelled so we know that it was made for a competition run by Sunflower Fabrics in 2001, in which it won a prize.This was probably the quilt that my stepfather Bob knew the best as it hung over the stairs at their house for nearly twenty years. It was the one he used to point out to people when telling them about Mum's quilts. Because of this, we had the sunflower quilt draped over Bob's coffin during his funeral, continuing the tradition we started when Mum died and her coffin was draped with her favourite quilt.If you like this little sample, there are lots more quilts I could show you. There are quilts based on my children's drawings, lots of floral ones, inspired by Mum's garden and many, many more. I wonder if Jack could bring me the Christmas quilts to photograph ...I'll leave you with a picture of my Mum. I miss her every day.Ann Brown"},
{"title": "Woven Stars", "date": "Tuesday 10 November 2020", "text": "It may have taken me much longer than usual but I've managed to design another pattern. What's more, it's not a scarf this time.These little Woven Stars are quickly knitted from scraps of yarn. They're made up of two identical triangles, one woven through the other and there are only five rows to knit for each triangle.You can vary the size by using different weights of yarn. Most of my stars were knitted with DK weight yarn but I also tried a few in thin sock yarn.I wanted to get this pattern finished as I thought it might be a useful resource for all the knitters making things to sell for charity. As my copyright notice says at the end of each pattern, I don't allow things made from my patterns to be sold for profit but I'm always happy when people use them to support a favourite charity. If you do this, Id love to hear about it.I have to say, knitting small things in bright colours makes taking photos so much easier. I can never resist the urge to re-arrange them into pretty patterns.In the absence of a Christmas tree to hang on, I plodded out into my wet and muddy garden to hang them on the ivy for a picture too.The cats supervised the garden photo shoot, intrigued by what the human was doing now. We are a constant mystery to each other. I enjoyed knitting these little stars which is more than I can say for the other Christmas knitting I'm doing at the moment. I'm working on a Christmas version of my Woodland Wreath  - not a new design as I'm using existing patterns. I'd forgotten just how dull it was knitting all those leaves. So far, I've knitted two sets to represent the honeysuckle and the ivy in my garden.The yellow embroidery is my attempt at the ivy flowers and took me ages to get right. I must have cut out hundreds of french knots before realising that less is more in this case. Next are the holly leaves. I've knitted those but not the berries to go with them. Then there's the mistletoe ... It will be nice to get on to something that isn't a leaf.I hope that you're enjoying your Christmas knitting and that you have time to add in a woven star or two."},
{"title": "Greetings from the Past", "date": "Monday 19 October 2020", "text": "Another collection of family treasures today, this time greetings cards of one sort or another, all dating from the 1940s, 50s or 60s.Aren't they pretty? I thought we'd go through them in date order, telling the tales behind them along the way. So, first of all there are these, mostly birthday cards from the 1940s.I think my favourite is the one with the crinoline lady on it.This was given to my Mum, Ann and is signed 'from Dorothy'. I don't know who Dorothy was, maybe a friend from school?This is Miss Dine's class at New Street School, Andover and would have been taken during World War Two. Mum is in the second row, second from the left (as we look at the photo), wearing a gym slip and white blouse and with her hair in bunches. Maybe Dorothy is in this picture too. There were 44 children in this class and only 16 of them were boys. The age range is quite big too, from the little girls like Mum to the big ones in the back row. Nearly thirty years after this picture was taken, I was briefly taught by Miss Dine too, just before she retired.Birthday postcards used to be quite common. This one was sent to Mum by her cousin Glenys for her ninth birthday in 1945.Given that Glenys lived just down the road from Mum, she would have had to walk further to the postbox than to deliver it by hand. I expect it was more exciting to get it in the post though. Glenys and her family lived with her grandmother during the war as they had to be moved out of their RAF house because of the danger of air raids.Here we have, from left to right, Mum, Glenys and Frances (Mum's sister, the one I was named after).The tiniest card in this group is a French New Year card, undated but written in French to Mum by Micheline. Again, I don't know who she was. Perhaps a pen friend when they were both at secondary school? It's a very pretty little card.Moving on to the 1950s and I have this lovely collection from Mum and Dad's wedding in September 1956.I found the lucky horseshoes and silver shoes in their box earlier this year. Do brides still get given these I wonder?You must always hang lucky horseshoes this way up so that your luck doesn't run out the bottom. Shoes are a very old symbol of luck and fertility which is why they are tied to the back of wedding cars. Here's Mum being given her lucky charms as she left the church.This is Mum's younger brother AllanI know, from the newspaper report at the time, that this little girl was called Dawn but nothing more.This is my favourite one of the wedding photos, taken just as the wind caught Mum's train and veil.As well as photos, Mum kept this little notebook with its lists of wedding guests, the presents, who to send slices of cake to ...The recipe for the wedding cake includes 37 eggs for cake, almond paste and icing and 11 lb of sugar. Luckily, rationing had ended a few years before this.Then there was all that dressmaking to do ... 18½ yards of rayon brocade for £3. 12 / 6 (12 shillings and sixpence) and 8 yards of figured taffets for £1 3/4. Mum's mother made the dress and, to say thank-you, she bought her this cuckoo clock which I remember fondly from my Granny's house. It now belongs to my daughter.Oh the excitement as children, waiting for the cuckoo to pop out of his little door.The list of wedding presents is interesting too, mostly quite modest things to help them in setting up their new home. Top of the list is 'Yellow Plaid Tea Service and Dinner Service - Mum and Dad'. I still have a few pieces of this set and am very fond of it.The numbers on the back show that it was made in April 1956, a few months before the wedding.There are a couple of beautiful wedding cards too ...... and who remembers these? Wedding telegrams which would have been read out by the Best Man at the reception.This tradition came to an end in 1982 when the telegram service stopped in England, having been replaced by the widespread use of the telephone.Sadly, Mum and Dad divorced in the 1970s. Mum died twelve years ago but Dad is still going strong; I had a chat with him over the phone this morning.Predictably enough, the next batch of cards are birth congratulations, first for my brother who was born in 1957 and then, three years after that, for me.It's quite hard to work out which are which as they mostly don't say 'baby boy' or 'baby girl' on them so I've had to guess a bit. I think these are the cards for Stephen's birth.Here he is with his proud parents in the garden at our Granny's house ...He had such blond hair. When I started primary school, I could always pick him out in the playground by his hair. The cards mostly feature babies in cradles, like this one ...That's a strip of real lace on the edge of the canopy.Cradles in tree tops were popular too; the card designers obviously hadn't read to the end of the rhyme.'Rock-a-bye Baby in the tree top,When the wind blows, the cradle will rock,When the bough breaks, the cradle will fall,Down will come baby, cradle and all.'I like this tiny card with the animals too ...Among all the traditional cards, this one looks rather modern ...This card was from Aunty Eva and Uncle Dan; Aunty Eva was the knitter of the matinee jacket that I mentioned in my post about old Baby Knitting Patterns.Fast forward to 1960 and there were more cards, this time for my birth.And then there were four ...This photo was taken in the same spot as the earlier one but Mum gets a chair to sit on this time.Again, the cards could be for a boy or girl, apart from this one, complete with a tactile baby blanket.This next one made me laugh. Another cradle up a tree ...... and look what it says inside ...Sorry about that, Stephen!This was from Mum's parents and, in their defence, not only was I their first granddaughter but I was born just a few years after their daughter Frances Mary died and I was given those names in memory of her.I also like this one; I'm not sure it shows up in the photo but it has glitter on it. I'm very partial to a glittery card.The next three cards were all for Mum from Stephen and I on various birthdays.The first one, with the little black dog, was just from Stephen.I'm guessing that this might have been for her 24th birthday which was a week after I was born, when Stephen would have been three.The other two cards are from both of us. I especially like this one ...I can just about write my name inside but Stephen has moved on to joined up writing.Stephen has put 30 kisses so I think this could have been for Mum's 30th birthday in 1966. I think this photo might have been taken around that time.This is one of my favourite photos of Mum. Note the trousers with the elastic under the foot. That was how we kept our stretchy 'slacks' in place in the days before Lycra. I had some too, both pairs probably made by Mum.One more collection of cards, this time all my own work!Actually, tell a lie, the one with the birds on is from StephenThis one is particularly elaborate ...Yes, that's right, an Advent Calendar card for Mothering Sunday. Funnily enough, this idea never caught on commercially. Leaving aside the fact that I obviously didn't know the meaning of the word 'Advent', I have no idea why there are only 14 doors. Most of the pictures aren't recognisable but the two at the top are a crown and an umbrella. Want to look inside?Spelling mistakes aside, I''m not sure why it says 'Mother' as I never called her anything but Mum or Mummy. Cards of the time often said 'Mother' though so maybe that's where I got it from.I recognised this next card as my work straight away.I'm pretty sure I still draw flowers like this.I've left the best till last. I can remember making these Easter cards; as you can see, I cut them out myself.When I showed them to my son, he said \"are those meant to be Easter eggs?\". Well obviously they are - and him a primary school teacher too.I hope you've enjoyed looking at these cards with me. I'll leave you with a picture of Stephen and I looking our best."},
{"title": "Conker Scarf", "date": "Thursday 15 October 2020", "text": "Six months after publishing my last pattern (a scarf), I have just managed to complete a new design (another scarf). Well, its a start.Conker scarf features a simple slip stitch rib pattern that's easy to knit and makes a warm, textured fabric. As you can see, I chose my yarn to match the conkers and the autumn leaves. It's an aran weight yarn from Katia called Azteca.I used 200g of yarn to knit my scarf but you could adapt the pattern for other weights of yarn and make your scarf any with or length you like.It's taken me a very long time to get this simple pattern written and checked, doing one small task a day so I hope there aren't any mistakes in it. Just remembering how to publish a pattern on ravelry was quite a challenge.As well as looking pretty, the conkers came in handy for holding the edges of the scarf down so that I could stretch the rib a bit for some photos.New, shiny conkers are very pleasing; Tolly cat likes to play pawball with them too - they don't roll straight which he likes. Can you spot the fake conker in this little bowl of them?It's the one still in its case. I bought this resin conker at a craft fair years ago and I'm very fond of it."},
{"title": "Autumn Samplers", "date": "Monday 12 October 2020", "text": "Last month I told you about a year long stitch-a-long that my daughter and I have embarked on, cross stitching a sampler for each season, using charts from Little Dove Designs. Well, we've finished our first one which is called 'Autumn Glows'.Here is Rose's sampler ...She stitched on 32 count linen in Raw, a natural, dark hessian colour which doesn't show up well in the photos. Rose uses Anchor stranded cottons and, as you can see, has signed her work for posterity. More of that later.Here's my finished sampler ...You get a better idea of the rich colours in this photo (due to the high powered lighting set up I have). One of the reasons we chose these designs is because of the designer's flair for colour. I stitched my sampler on 16 count Aida in a flecked oatmeal shade that is quite a lot lighter than the one Rose used. I used to only stitch on linen too but my eyes have got older so aida is sometimes a better option for me now. My threads are DMC.There are lots of lovely details in this sampler, from the house at the top ...Rose enjoyed stitching all those little leaves, I didn't!... to the owl on the apple tree ...... and the row of creatures, flowers and toadstools at the bottom.I think this is my favourite part of the whole picture. The french knots on the toadstools almost look like little beads and as for that lovely spider ...Rose is an archivist and she's trained me well in the importance of signing and dating everything. So, cross stitch is always signed near the edge of the fabric where it will be hidden under the frame but there for future generations to read. You'll notice that Rose hasn't given the day that she finished her sampler. That's because she finished one day later than me. The tables could be reversed next time. She did, however, manage to keep her writing in a straight line, unlike me.I think hers, all in capitals, is much easier to read too. I may have to do that next time.We will be starting our next sampler Winter Warmth in December. I suspect that these will take us longer to finish, what with all that other festive stitching we shall want to do. Christmas cross stitch is definitely the best."},
{"title": "Knitting for Baby", "date": "Friday 9 October 2020", "text": "When I say 'knitting for baby', I haven't got a specific baby in mind - more the whole practice of encasing the human young in wool. What with babygros and washing machines, there is perhaps less knitting done for new babies than there used to be. As Elizabeth Zimmermann says in Knitter's Almanac'If there is one fact on which all grandmothers agree, it is that no daughter-in-law knows how to wash wool. This may be true, but it is no reason for the grandmas to stop knitting.'These words of wisdom are from the same chapter'Although babies rarely, if ever, express their pleasure at being dressed in wool, it is surely manifest when you dote on a small plump person soundly and contentedly asleep, swaddled in woollen sweater, woollen leggings, and a soft wool bonnet, snugly tucked under a fine warm wool blanket.'Now that we've got that clear, let's move on. My interest in the whole subject of knitting for babies was re-awakened recently by the gift of some lovely old knitting patterns to add to my collection. I decided it was high time I listed my patterns properly; fast forward several weeks and I now have a large spreadsheet of them all, divided up by publisher. 'Spreadsheet' - doesn't that sound grown-up?Anyway, having done that, I realised that I could now sort the patterns by subject, rather than by publisher which is much more interesting. Trends in fashion and design jump out at you when you look through, say, cardigan patterns spanning thirty or forty years. But the main thing I realised as I sorted them all into piles was that the baby patterns are my favourites. So, I thought I'd take you on a browse through them today. There are an awful lot of patterns so make sure you're sitting comfortably ...Here is my collection of patterns for Pram Sets; these are all about keeping the baby warm outdoors. There's normally a pair of leggings, a jacket, a hat or bonnet and maybe a pair of mittens too. This is one of my favourites; it even has a pattern for a pram blanket.Sirdar Sunshine are some of the prettiest old patterns you can find; I'm quite tempted to frame some of mine. I'm sure Elizabeth Zimmermann would approve of this happy baby, covered in knitting from top to toe. Or how about this very stylish set for an older baby?That coat is just beautiful and the hat would appear to have animal ears too; I thought that was a modern trend.Of course it's not easy to get babies to pose for fashion photos so many publishers opt just to lay the sets out on a pretty background. Emu patterns often feature this approach.Or, you can attempt an action shot (minus baby) as in this Ladyship pattern.One more pram set pattern, a later Sirdar Sunshine pattern and just look at how much you get for 9d. That's nine old pence for the younger readers; Great Britain changed to the decimal system and 100 pennies in a pound in 1971. Before that, there were 20 shillings in the pound and each shilling was made up of twelve pence. I'd better stop there as I'm starting to sound like Hagrid explaining wizarding money to Harry. Back to the pattern ...As well as the leggings, you get patterns for a dress, two matinee jackets, a bonnet, bootees, mittens and a shawl. That should keep any knitter busy for a while.Before we leave pram sets, I thought you might like to see an old family photo of one being worn.That's my brother Stephen smiling happily in his pushchair more than sixty years ago. See his bonnet? That is what was (and maybe still is) called a baby's helmet. Baby boys had knitted helmets and baby girls wore bonnets. Which leads me neatly on to my collection of bonnet patterns ...Actually there are bootee patterns in there too as heads and feet seem to go together in the world of knitting for babies. For some reason, helmet patterns often feature a pointed front - possibly inspired by early flying helmets?Here's a nice example of a pattern for a helmet for a boy and a bonnet for a girl in one Bestway pattern; the bonnet is even described as a poke bonnet.Sirdar went through a phase of illustrating their bonnet patterns in a slightly surreal way. Balls of wool on sticks, rather strange, disembodied heads ...I think there's one with the bonnets on balloons too.I was tempted to try one of the many pretty bonnet patterns so, one Lister pattern and a ball of Baby Smiles later ...It was a nice pattern to knit with its simple picot hem and twisted pattern stitch and it didn't take long. Maybe I should design a traditional baby bonnet one day? I measured this one while it was still a rectangle, just in case.Moving on to the bootees (I've just adopted that older spelling, having called them booties for years) ... although, they look nice, I'm not a big fan of things that involve trying to tie ribbons on to wriggling babies so I'm always attracted to bootees that stay up on their own.There are some rather modern looking shoe types in this pattern, featuring more things on sticks from Sirdar.The little rack of bootees is nice but, I have to say, adding that weird head is a step too far for me. The green pair on the top (labelled B) are a style that crops up in several of my patterns and appear to have an inner sock; the ribbons are purely decorative. I shall have to try these one day.I was very taken with the long bootees on this pattern too; nice and warm under baby gowns and very unlikely to fall off. A long, lacy pair in white would go well with a christening robe.I think my favourite bootee pattern though has to be this little one from Bestway. A combination of a simple cover design with bright colours and some interesting and practical designs.There are several of these that I'd like to knit but I plumped for the little yellow boots on the left - such a clean looking design. They have a garter stitch sole and rib uppers and cuff and feature a lovely pointed toe. Winklepickers for babies? It looks impractical as babies don't have pointed feet but I think the rib would probably stretch on the foot.I think you learn something from every pattern you knit and these little bootees provided me with a lot of food for thought. First of all, the shape kept me reminding me of something, especially with the cuff folded up. It took me a while to realise that it was the illustrations in this Ladybird book from my childhood.Here is the Shoemaker laying out his cut out shoe shapes in the evening; see what I mean?The other thing I really liked was the way the shaping worked with the rib. This is about half way up the instep.I kept laying it flat like that and admiring it. You could knit a good, double-sided coaster or mat like this. Or ... reversible squares for a baby blanket.These are worked in the round from the outside in. The pink square shows the right side and the yellow shows the back. it took several attempts to work out the shaping but I rather like these. I pulled out all the chalky pastels I could find in my collection of Stylecraft Sopecial DK and set about planning a small baby blanket.I'm about half way through knitting thirty squares, two in each colour, and I'm enjoying making them. I can knit them faster than they take to block though so there's a bit of a backlog by the blocking mat. The rib stitch means that they need blocking to tame the edges. I'm hoping that I can sew them together using the bumps from the cast on edge so fingers crossed for that. I really like how the lines of the rib catch the light differently, depending on the angle.Once I've finished this blanket, I might go back and design a ribbed bootee based on this pattern but with a wider toe.What shall we look at next? \"Matinee Jackets!\" I hear you cry - right then. Now I have strong views about matinee jackets and things that button all the way down the front are cardigans in my book, whatever the pattern publisher chose to call them. Having said that, I think matinee jackets are a very useful piece of clothing for babies. That wide, unfastened bottom fits nicely over a nappy (especially if you use proper nappies which are bulkier than the disposable ones) and there's nothing to stop you knitting them in bright colours.Many of these are classic designs which don't date at all. Here are a few of my personal favourites ...I'd swap the ribbons for buttons on these.Lace, embroidery or a combination of both. I do like the collar on that blue one.A double breasted jacket to match Sir's helmet.I do love the older, black and white patterns too. This one from Bairnswear features a wonderful cradle as well as some stylish jackets. And the prize for the happiest baby goes to this little one on yet another Sirdar Sunshine pattern.The shawl on the right is a carrying shawl with a hood to go over the baby's head. Now that's another good idea.Again, I was tempted to try one of the designs and I chose one from this small, black and white pattern from Patons.I'm knitting the one at the bottom right. I've only done the right front so far but it's looking nice.This is a matinee jacket knitted for my son by my Great Aunty Eva in the 1980s and worn by both of my children.I couldn't find a photo of either of them wearing it but here's Eva as a young woman in the 1920s.Like all the women in the family, Aunty Eva knitted as a matter of course; she was also the person who taught me to crochet.As we've already established, button up things that don't qualify as matinee jackets are cardigans and I've got quite a few of those too.I don't think I've show you any Weldon's patterns yet. Weldons and Bestway were both big publishers, specialising in small, brightly coloured patterns. This sort of thing, with  a model next to a row of different coloured garments comes up again and again.I also like the two-colour patterns in this one ...Or how about  this Sirdar Sunshine pattern for three 'continental coatees' - very daring. No heads on sticks this time, just a duck with knitting needles.Or batwing sleeves for babies? I'm not sure this would work, given how short babies' arms are anyway.The stitch pattern on this one reminded me of a simple little caridgan that I knitted for my babies, complete with rabbit buttons.Both of them wore it when they first came home from hospital and, in my son's case, the sleeves had to be rolled up several times.I can't remember where I got the pattern for their pink cardigan but this one got a lot of wear too.Here's Jack having quality time with a yellow dinosaur, as you do ...... and Rose fast asleep.They're wearing the same pink socks to match too. I knitted Rose's little dungarees as well but I'm not sure I've kept them. Didn't she have a lot of hair? In case you're thinking that she only got to wear her brother's cast-offs, I did knit this set specially for her. Look at those little short legs.The background to the photo is the children's pram blanket, knitted for them by their Great-Granny. Rose did get the knitted picture blanket too, one of my first designs, all worked out on graph paper.If you're still reading this, well done. Just one more lot now and I shall stop. I've only got a few patterns for pram covers and shawls but they are some of my favourites. These two patterns are interesting in that it looks like the blue pattern in the first and the yellow one in the second are the same design.It also looks like a similar stitch pattern to the one I'm using to knit little baby squares.These two Sirdar shawl patterns are very similar too, if not identical. Both have a traditional leaf pattern blanket and two lacy shawls.This is the older one, No. 54.The newer one is No. 254; the photography is brighter but the designs and stitch patterns are very similar.I'm a big fan of those leaf blankets and designed my own version a while ago - Secret Garden.I knitted a shawl for my children too, nothing special, just a practical, warm shawl.Here's a newborn Jack in it, being held by his Great-Granny ...... and here he is, four years later, when baby Rose came home from hospital in the shawl.He looks serious but he was actually very pleased with his new sister.At the other end of the shawl scale in terms of practicability are the Shetland lace shawls, fine enough to be drawn through a wedding ring. I knitted one of these for a friend's baby many years ago and have always wanted to knit another. When my Covid brain is up to it, I must order the yarn and get on with that.And that's the end of my long trawl through my old knitting patterns for babies. I hope you've enjoyed it as I've got lots of other lovely old patterns to share with you another time. Jumpers and cardigans for adults and children, doll's clothes, toys, gloves ..."},
{"title": "Sampler Progress", "date": "Thursday 24 September 2020", "text": "A quick update on the progress my daughter and I are making with out Autumn cross stitch samplers. Here's Rose's first ...She's finished the picture at the top - all those leaves - and is now doing the rows at the bottom. The gaps are where she's leaving the backstitch until last. I cant' be that organised ... or self-controlled.I'm working downwards from the middle, backstitch and all.Mine looks more complete because of the writing but I've still got that house and tree at the top to start. We keep telling each other it's not a race but ... Unless the border really slows us down, we should both be finished in plenty of time to start the Winter Sampler in December."},
{"title": "Still Knitting", "date": "Monday 21 September 2020", "text": "Yes, I am still knitting, although it's not always easy. Anything complicated is too tiring but some of the knitting that should be easy has been giving me problems too. Earlier in the summer, I knitted a cowl based on my Nick's Boring Scarf Pattern.This turned out to need too much concentration so I was glad to finish it. Then I went back to sock knitting. Now sock knitting is one of the things I count as automatic knitting - the sort of thing I can do while reading. It turns out that that's no longer the case. There's an awful lot of dropped stitches and sloppy tension behind these socks ...I shall just have to persevere until sock knitting becomes automatic again.I decided that what I needed was some simple knitting that would keep me going for a while but not be too boring but couldn't find anything that appealed to me. Then, when I was clearing out some old projects, I found this pattern from Woolly Thoughts.Double Vision is a blanket that looks like it's made up of lots of colours but, in reality, you only need ten different colours. They are worked together in different combinations to give the finished effect. The original blanket uses bright, rainbow colours to give a stained glass look but I decided to use shades of yarn that I already had plenty of.As you can see, the blanket is made up of right angled strips and I've knitted three so far. the colours look much better in real life; I had trouble taking a halfway decent photo. I'm enjoying knitting this blanket although I have to watch that I'm not dropping one strand of yarn - another automatic thing that isn't quite so automatic anymore.I seem to be able to manage other crafts better than I do knitting at the moment. I've been enjoying exploring loom knitting, inspired by a very generous gift from a new loom knitting friend on ravelry.This little lot arrived one day and was then followed up by this ...This all-in-one loom is the one I'm using at the moment for my experiment with lace knitting. I started with a 'proper' lace knitting stitch pattern and then changed it around to make it easier and quicker for me to knit, while still giving me a texture that I liked. The result is a not-quite-the-same-on-both-sides fabric that still lies flat (and both sides are nice). The wrong side looks like a slightly flattened out version of the right side.I'm enjoying knitting this. The yarn is James C Brett's Marble Chunky, shade 84 and I'm hoping not to have to buy another ball before the scarf is long enough. If I do though, I'm sure such a lovely colour will come in handy for something else - mittens to match perhaps?Before settling on a lace stitch for my loom knit scarf, I played around with a slip stitch rib. It worked but was taking me ages so I translated it into a needle knitting project instead. This counts as my first new design since being ill. I know it's only a simple scarf but still, it's a start.This will be the first year for a long time when I haven't published a big series of Christmas patterns. I still have the idea I had planned to use  this year so maybe next Christmas? In the meantime, we are having a Christmas KAL on my ravlery group so that we don't miss all the normal chat and support. People are knitting any of my old patterns that they haven't yet made and we are all sharing pictures and chatting about our progress. I wanted to join in but, obviously, I've knitted them all so I decided to make a variation of my Woodland Wreath. I'm going to make a more Christmassy version, picking out appropriate patterns from my other Christmas projects. I must have designed at least half a dozen little snowmen for a start! So far, I've covered my polystyrene wreath and made a start on the leaves.The lighter leaves are the smaller, basic leaves from the original pattern and are intended to represent the honeysuckle that thinks it owns my garden. The darker ones are a slightly more rounded version and are the Irish Ivy which is working on the parts of the wall not already dominated by the honeysuckle.This is the ivy that would traditionally have been used to decorate homes at Christmas as those spikey flowers would throw snowflake shadows in candle lit rooms. I'm going to add the flowers to my ivy leaves with embroidery - lots of french knots.I'm going to knit some holly leaves too before I get on to the really christmassy stuff. I may even add lights to my wreath as you can get such nice little ones now. Do come and join us on this knitalong. If you want to knit a Christmas pattern not designed by me, that's fine too. Its just nice to have lots of people to chat to as we prepare for our lockdown Christmas."},
{"title": "Cross Stitch Progress", "date": "Friday 11 September 2020", "text": "One week in to our stitch-along and my daughter and I are both really enjoying working on our autumn samplers. The colours are beautiful and there are lots of nice little details. Rose is working upwards from the middle ...Those dark shapes at the top are the start of what's going to be quite a big house. I'm not looking forward to getting to that part. The biggest chunk I've had to do so far is the apple tree.You'll notice that Rose's stitching looks lovely and even in her hoop while I've gone for the crumpled look. The photos don't really do our projects justice; the colours glow in real life. The fabrics are shades of brown too, not grey. And now I've got five pumpkins to stitch ...I'm feeling particularly achey this week (it would be nice if my immune system could work out that it doesn't still need to fight Covid) and it's been hard to do things. At times like this, it's easy to just concentrate on the 'must dos' like cooking and eating - not much fun when you're exhausted and you can't taste the food anyway. It helps to just try to think \"what do I feel like doing?\" and then go with that, even if it means starting yet another new project.So, yesterday I catalogued 58 knitted squares. This is what happens when you're the mother of an archivist, you start listing your world. Actually, this was something I've been wanting to do for months. It all started with this ...This is a Scheepjes Colour Pack of all 36 shades of their Stone Washed yarn and the 22 River Washed shades. Each little ball weighs 10g and is enough to knit or crochet a square. The yarn is a mixture of cotton and acrylic and is lovely to work with.My plan was to knit a square in each colour, leaving just enough yarn to wind a colour peg for future reference. I used my favourite stitch pattern from my Frankie's Blankie, Quilted Lattice and just added a small garter stitch border as I went.The two yarns in the pack are a bit different. The yellow is Stone Washed and is smooth and, although different shades are blended in each colour, this blending is very subtle. The orange River Washed square is fluffier and the blend of colours is much more noticeable. I blocked my squares as I went along and ended up with a big pile of them; they're about 13 cm or 5\" square.Mostly there was enough yarn left to wind a full colour peg but there are a few scantily clad ones too. I used up every bit of yarn.My big idea for these squares was to use them to make a digital shade card, one that I could use for planning colour schemes for future blankets. This is where the cataloguing comes in. First, I separated them into the two types and then matched each square with its colour peg. I started with the 36 Stone Washed colours.The next thing to do was to photograph each square separately and to name the images with the shade number and the name of the colour (I'd written this on the pegs). This took a while but was nicely mindless. I copied each finished image and then cropped those copies so that the square filled the image. These are the pictures I plan to use for designing.So ... I use the free photo editing software Photoscape and one of the features they offer is 'page' where you can combine individual images to make one finished picture. There are lots of options for arranging your photos, including one with 25 even sized square tiles. Blanket planning, here we go! For numbers of squares below 25 I just crop the unused ones out at the editing stage; for bigger numbers I'd put more than one image together on a normal document. To test it out I made blocks of all 36 Stone Washed colours in order, twelve at a time.Shades 801 - 812Shades 813 - 824Shades 825 - 836Then I put together some simple diagonal stripes ...You can also add borders to the individual squares to get an idea of what it would look like if edgings were added to the squares - perhaps in a crochet blanket.Lots of fun to be had here. When I catalogued the River Washed squares, I noticed how much more intense the colours were than the Stone Washed, something I hadn't realised while knitting them. Stone WashedRiver WashedInterestingly, neither range has much in the way of true blues but there are quite a few turquoises and blue-greens. Not much yellow either but a fair bit of orange. Put together, I think they make a very useful colour palette. I'm tempted to try a crochet blanket first but, in the meantime, I've got to decide what to do with my 58 squares - not the easiest number to turn into a blanket."},
{"title": "Stitching", "date": "Monday 7 September 2020", "text": "During my Covid summer, I've been doing quite a lot of stitching. My concentration levels are pretty variable and it helps to have different projects on the go so that I can find something to do, depending on how well I feel. I have to break any activity down into lots of small stages now and that's how I approach my crafts too.Early in the summer I made several small quilts, mostly from books by Kathleen Tracy, who is my favourite quilt designer. This first one is proudly labelled as my plague quilt as I made it when I was first ill.Those were the days when I thought I'd only be ill for a matter of a few weeks. Such innocence.This log cabin quilt and the next one are both from the book A Prairie Journey. I have all Kathleen's books except one (and now there's a new one coming out too) and they're really good. She combines beautiful, small quilt projects with some quilting social history, a perfect combination.I also made a simple doll's quilt as part of a friends birthday present in June; it took me ages choosing the buttons to add to this one.This next one is the biggest quilt I've made this year; it's very simple but the quilting seemed to take forever.From the biggest to the smallest ... this little quilt came to light when I was having a sort out. I''d pinned it together ready for quilting and then forgot about it. I made this one to fit my small tea tray; quilts are great at soaking up tea stains.The next quilts on my list are two half square triangle quilts. I made two sets of half square triangles, intending to sew them together into two quilts. Each would have exactly the same pieces but put together in different ways. So far, I've pieced this barn raising one which will be for my daughter.I've also been doing a bit of embroidery, inspired by several books. One was this one by Lynette Anderson which I bought for the hexagon quilt on the cover. I only bought the book this summer and, so far, all I've made is this little coaster.I'd like to make more of these.I really like Gail Pan's stitchery designs which combine embroidery and patchwork. I made this bag from Patchwork Loves Embroidery for my daughter for Christmas back in 2016.This summer I was a bit concerned that Rose (who is a very keen cross stitcher) was in danger of running out of kits during her extended lockdown so I put together a collection of little kits to keep her going for a while. And, of course, I had to make a suitable bag to put them in.This one was from the same book as her Christmas bag. I think I might need to buy a new Gail Pan book soon.I've been cross stitching too. Apart from the big sampler I showed you a few weeks ago, I've cross stitched a few birthday cards and, during Rose's visit, I finished this little sheep sampler.This is a design from Jardin Privé, the fourth part in a series called 'Sheep's Story'. You can stitch all four parts together but I just chose this one; I liked the woman spinning. I had to change the backstitch on the spinning wheel though as the design had the yarn going all round the wheel. Not how a spinning wheel works!My current cross stitch is very exciting as it's the start of a year long project that my daughter and I are doing together. We bought a set of seasonal sampler charts from Little Dove Designs and are planning to stitch each one in its proper season. We started the autumn one a few days ago ...Rose is using 32 count linen and I'm using 16 count aida so our finished samplers will be the same size but the colours of the fabric won't be the same. I'm using DMC threads and she's using Anchor so there might be a bit of variation there too.The idea is that we finish this sampler before December, ready to start the Winter one then. Once all four seasons are finished, we just have to order eight matching frames (!) and then we'll be able to display them in their season.I've never done a stitchalong before and it's so exciting. We both started in the middle (obviously) but now we're working in different directions. I can't wait until our next show and tell when we can have a look at each other's progress. The colours are beautiful; I'll take some close up pictures to show you once I've done a bit more."},
{"title": "Finding Things", "date": "Monday 31 August 2020", "text": "I've been slowly going through all the boxes and baskets in my overcrowded store of yarn and finished projects. All sorts of things came to light, including lots of bits and pieces I'd forgotten about for years.For example ... a larger version of my Pinwheel Purse, a little yellow elephant Finger Puppet, designed years ago for the Big Yellow Friday fundraising push by the charity I support, a couple of Puffballs and a strange cube thing. The purse in the bottom left hand corner is another use of the deep rolls that I used in my Winter Rainbow scarf; I think I'd like to turn this into a pattern one day.By far the biggest pile of stuff though was unfinished projects - some of them abandoned because they weren't working, some because I got bored and moved on to other things. Would you like to see some of them?This was one of my regular experiments with knitting geometrical shapes, this time pentagons. I made a few balls, sewed a few pentagons together and then lost interest. Looking at them now, I quite like the two colour one at the bottom; that has possibilities.This next one is something I definitely want to finish.I knitted these small, embroidered letters as part of my Alphabet Series in 2012. The idea is to use them as a garland, pegging up the letters to spell out whatever you want to say. I always intended to knit more of the common letters but, again, didn't get round to it. I was pleased to see that I'd packed the letters away with everything I need to carry on with this project though, including a list of the letters still to knit and the felt to back them. I still have some of that blue yarn too so I really must resurrect this.When I turned out the baskets under my table in search of the bread knife (don't ask), I found this big basket ...... which turned out to be the home of one of my many unfinished blankets.Lots of squares and quarter circles, all knitted in Sirdar Snuggly DK. I'd actually knitted quite a lot of this one and most of the yarn I need is there too I think.I was going to call this one Scrappy Circles I remember. The idea was to sew the quarter triangles to the corners of the squares to make a sort of wooly Drunkard's Path.This is another project I'd like to finish one day.I start an awful lot of blankets and most of them never get finished. This one was a bright idea but then the yarn became difficult to find so I lost interest.The next one is more recent and is based on the shape used in my Patchwork Purse pattern.When I find an old project that I want to re-start, the first thing to do is to go through my big pile of pattern notebooks, hoping to find some useful notes. According to the notebook, these pastel squares were designed in February 2013.Now I really like these - heavily textured squares, knitted with My First Regia. My original notes were a bit confusing so I knitted another square, re-writing as I went. The pattern still seemed good to me (this is by no means always the case when I go back to old designs) so I think this is another one to get on with. It would make a lovely baby blanket with all that texture on both sides.I'm not too sure about these strangely constructed squares though ...Each square is made up of four identical pieces, overlapped and sewn together where they touch to make pinwheels. The idea was to join the squares as shown in the picture; the back would then look like this ...Quite nice but a bit fiddly perhaps?Another pile of squares, this time crochet ones.Swirls in colours, set in navy blue squares. I had grandiose ideas of turning this into a colour swatch blanket of Stylecraft Special DK, using as many shades as possible. While we're looking at crochet, what about this?This one goes back about ten years and was going to be a shawl, inspired by the ammonites we collected on our Dorset holidays.I'm not sure you'd know that's what the crochet shapes were meant to be, although maybe they'd improve with blocking.Do you remember being told that the best things come in small packages? Definitely not true when you're a child hoping that the big, exciting parcel under the Christmas tree is for you. Well, in the case of found projects, it is sometimes true.Two pretty little tins, each with lovely projects inside. The round one is my collection of crocheted snowflakes.These are all from the book 100 Snowflakes to Crochet, worked with white thread and a fine hook and starched to use as decorations. When I've made lots of them, they're going to be a garland for the windows of my Winter Wonderland.The other tin is full of tiny crochet Granny Squares, about 4 cm across and worked with Appletons Crewel Wool.One day these are going to be my tribute to a lady I never knew who crocheted one of my family treasures.This lovely stole was made by my Mother-in-law's Mother-in-Law, Eva Hollingsworth, née Jubb in the 1950s. A few years ago I was very excited to find the original pattern that she would have used in this copy of the Vogue Knitting Book from September 1955.It was one of the 'Italian Originals' mentioned on the cover; unfortunately the photograph is in black and white but still ...I hope you've enjoyed this look at some of the many things I haven't finished making. I shall be interested to read your comments on them. Are there any I should turn into patterns ... or hide again?!"},
{"title": "Family Treasures", "date": "Wednesday 26 August 2020", "text": "During my daughter's visit last week, we (well, mostly she) did a lot of gardening. The silver birch is now a slightly odd shape but less out of control than it was and we've reclaimed some more plants from the weeds. In between gardening and a lot of snacks, we started cataloguing some family treasures. This is what happens when an Archivist comes to stay.We're not talking valuable heirlooms here, mostly domestic things that come with a story attached. Like this biscuit barrel for instance ...This was a wedding present when my Grandparents were married on the 21st December 1935. Christmas weddings were much more common in the past than they are now; I wonder if it's because they coincided with time off work? Here's a picture of them on their wedding day.Frank and Ida PothecaryOr there's this small souvenir sewing kit, again belonging to my Granny ...It doesn't look as if it has been used, although the scissors that would have been in it are missing (I must look through Granny's old sewing box to see if they're there). As you can see, this little kit came from Corfe Castle. My Great Uncle Jack was the last stationmaster at Corfe Castle station before it closed in the early 1970s. I remember going to see him there and thinking it strange that he lived in a station. They had already taken up the rails then.Here's Uncle Jack with other staff at the station in a photo taken in 1965. I found this in a secondhand book last year. He's the one in the middle with the glasses.Uncle Jack worked out the rest of his time before retirement at Swanage station. In the 1990s the line from Swanage to Corfe Castle was re-opened as a heritage steam railway and the old Stationmaster's house is now a visitor attraction.What I really want to show you today though is some of the old family bibles that we have. The big one (with all the names and dates at the front) is still at my stepfather's house but I've got quite a pile of smaller ones.They don't look that exciting but there's a wealth of information to be gleaned from old bibles as they were often written in. One of the oldest  belonged to my Great Grandfather George Cannons who was born in 1872. As you can see, it came to him from his Sunday School. Here's George who also worked on the railway (there's a strong tradition of railway workers in my family, right down to my brother).But the bible tells us that George then gave his bible to my mother Ann in 1944.Mum would have been seven when she got the bible. She was born in her grandparents house and lived with her parents and grandparents for her first few years. Here she is with her Grandad George.As well as the inscription, this bible was also full of these beautiful cards which I think Mum probably got from her Sunday school during the 1940s.Or how about this bible, given by Annie (my Great-Grandmother and George's wife) to her mother Eliza Spooner in 1893.Annie would have been 17 then and had been in service for several years. Look closer at that cross stitched bookmark and what do you see?That's a lock of plaited hair above the writing. I think it might have been Annie's as the colour looks right. Here's a photograph of her as a young woman, taken a few years after she gave the bible to her mother.Also in the photo is her handwritten recipe for Peanut Butter Cookies which, as you can see, I still make. I wrote about them several years ago if you'd like to try the recipe for yourself - Peanut Butter Cookies.We have other books that belonged to Annie, like this Communion Book from 1891 when she would have been 15.I don't know who Mrs Chilton was. I remember visiting a Mrs Chilton with my Granny but that would have been in the  1960s and 70s.Then there's this rather touching inscription in one of two small books in a case (a hymn book and a prayer book).A present from her future husband George in 1893. They were married in November 1895 and, you'll be glad to hear, did enjoy many happy years together. George died in 1945 and Annie in 1956. I'm rather fond of this picture of them on holiday; I think that's crochet she's doing.One more Hymn and Prayer book belonging to Annie, again a present from her husband. this time it was to mark her 50th birthday in November 1925.Annie and George had eight children, three boys and five girls. Two of the children, Walter and Olive died in infancy but the rest lived long lives. The eldest, another George, deserves a whole post to himself as he was the black sheep of the family. Jack (named John Noel Cannons because he was born on Christmas Day) I've already mentioned, so that leaves the four girls. They all had three letter names: Ivy, Eva, Ada and Ida. Ida was my grandmother. This picture of the three older girls was taken in about 1912 when Ivy was 13, Eva 8 and Ada 4.My Granny was the baby of the family, born in 1915. I have several books that were hers. Her 'Helps to Worship' was given to her to mark her confirmation in March 1929 when she would have been eight.Here's a picture of her taken on the same day ...I also have her prayer book, given to her by her father George on her tenth birthday.Ida married Frank Pothecary in 1935 and they went on to have four children: Ann (my mother), Frances, Hazel and Allan. Ann and Frances were less than two years apart in age; here they are in their garden, complete with a dolly in her pram.I have several books belonging to Frances; this Prayer Book was given to her by her Aunty Ada to mark her christening in September 1938.Sadly, Frances died at the age of 17 in a motorcycle crash. I was born four years later and was named after her.Frances PothecaryI've got one more family bible to show you and this one I can actually remember seeing as a child.It's looking a bit the worse for wear and there's no inscription, but I know that this was the bible my Mum carried when she was Matron of Honour at her sister Hazel's wedding in 1962 (I think it was 1962, correct me if I'm wrong Hazel).To finish with, here's a group photo from that wedding, including, at the end of the row, my Granny Ida holding a slightly puzzled looking toddler who is me."},
{"title": "All sorts of crafts", "date": "Tuesday 11 August 2020", "text": "I'm still finding it hard to settle to any one thing for very long. This heatwave isn't helping - I could do without something that makes me more breathless - and I've had several more tests this week. Any disruption to my daily routine throws me completely. I had CT scans on Sunday and an Echo Cardiogram on Monday - that's the lot for now.When nothing appeals, I root through the boxes of unfinished stuff and see what catches my eye. Most recently, it was my lovely Turtle hexagon loom so I've been slowly adding to my little pile of hexiflats.I'm sewing pairs of hexagons together, all woven from the same ball of variegated sock yarn, then I shall join them together to make some sort of table topper. I'm thinking of interspersing these ones with plain white hexagons to which I've added a bit of embroidery. I'll fold single hexagons in half for the edges so that my finished shape will have straight sides.I've just discovered that Gabi from Turtle yarns has now brought out a tiny little hexagon loom called the Penny Loom which is only 1\" across. Just how good is that? Anyway, The Handweaver's Studio here in the UK now stock Turtle looms so I emailed them to ask if they plan to stock the new loom. I got an answer back saying that they're already ordered and would I like to reserve one? Of course I would!I've also finished my first ever loom knitting project, a thick, textured cowl, using two strands of aran doubled.I'm wondering whether to make my daughter model it when she arrives tomorrow - ideal wear for a heatwave! I really enjoyed making this and am now wondering what to make next. Double knit or single, something useful or just a sample?I haven't forgotten knitting but I can only manage nice, simple garter stitch (and even then I have a tendency to drop stitches). I've done the first two 'L's of my Double Vision Blanket which I'm thoroughly enjoying.It's not a very good photo; I had to stand on the piano stool to fit it all in and the light was a bit weird. This blanket uses ten colours (plus contrast); the colours will be the diagonal line of squares running from top left to bottom right. The other squares show each of the colours mixed with each of the other colours in turn. I haven't explained that very well, go and look at the pattern page for something  more coherent. Anyway, I think it's looking good."},
{"title": "The Mint Moth", "date": "Sunday 9 August 2020", "text": "Look who I saw in my garden this weekend.When I first spotted this little chap and his friends, I thought they looked like miniature butterflies; they're probably not much more than a centimetre across with their wings open and, look like small flies when flying. They were only interested in the white flowers of the marjoram / oregano and spent a long time on them.After much leaning over the herb bed (and many blurred shots), I finally managed to get a photo of one of them so that I could look them up. They are, sadly, not butterflies from the world of The Borrowers but moths called Mint Moths which, as you might guess, like mint flowers and marjoram. My mint is very tatty and beneath their contempt but I'm glad they like the marjoram."},
{"title": "A Woolly Ambition", "date": "Thursday 6 August 2020", "text": "More than thirty years ago I found this book in a secondhand bookshop in Keswick.Mary Thomas wrote two classic knitting books, this one and one of knitting patterns (actually stitch patterns) - both of which are essential reading for any knitter. I return to them again and again and every time, I learn something new. This one was first published in 1938 and, from the first time I read it all those years ago, I was fascinated by the chapter on Frame or Rake Knitting.More commonly called Loom Knitting now, Frame Knitting can be worked in the round  or flat. What particularly caught my eye were the pictures on this page.'Rib in Raised Cross Stitch' looked interesting - that's the picture at the bottom left - this was nothing like the French knitting on cotton reels of my childhood.I lodged the idea in the \"things I need to try one day\" part of my mind and, every so often, I'd read the chapter again and decide I really must do something about it. And now, many years later, I've finally got round to it.No, it's not a present; this is how KnitUK package up their orders before sending them out. A plain white paper carrier bag and tissue paper, both of which can be re-used and even the paperwork is clipped to the bag with a very useful Wonder Clip. It quite made my day to receive this and I shall definitely be ordering from this company again. As well as loom knitting supplies, they also stock yarn, knitting needles and crochet hooks.Obviously, I had ordered a knitting loom but I was also tempted by a few other pretty bits and bobs.Row counters, snips and stitch markersBut of course, the star of the show was my new little loom. I chose the smallest straight loom which has the pegs closer together than most plastic looms. I'm still using two strands of aran weight yarn but look - I'm doing it!That 'Rib in Raised Cross Stitch' turns out to be a combination of rib and a twisted stocking stitch. The fabric is one thickness but the stitch looks exactly the same on both sides. The resulting fabric is soft and squishy and would make a lovely warm cowl. That's what I'm hoping this will turn into if I have enough yarn. I think it looks very pleasing when you look down into the loom too.Mary Thomas warned that the cast on edge 'is always loose and unsatisfactory' and she wasn't wrong. That loose, flared edge at the bottom bothered me so I fiddled around with a crochet hook, trying to tighten it up. Then I realised that, if I just tugged on the cast on tail of yarn, it pulled it into shape. That's why the cast on tail is now so long that I've had to tie it into a butterfly.I'd like to try this stitch with a variegated yarn next and then I want to experiment with normal circular knitting on the loom and anything else I can do with it. I'd be grateful for any advice from actual, grown up loom knitters out there. I'm so pleased to have finally achieved another one of my very many woolly ambitions, as well as discovering a good new supplier in the process."},
{"title": "A Cross Stitch Sampler", "date": "Friday 31 July 2020", "text": "Two blog posts in two days! No, I won't be posting every day but I thought I'd try a quick post on one of the things I've been doing over the summer.I find that I can only do little bits of anything at one time and, although I have lots of lovely kits to do, most of them look too daunting at the moment. So I was really glad to unearth a cross stitch sampler that my daughter gave me for my birthday a couple of years ago. Samplers are good because the patterns tend to be quite repetitive and symmetrical and there are no fractional stitches or back stitches to worry about.I'd just made a start on it when I got it and then put it away (as you do) so there was lots left to do. And, slowly but surely, I finished it!Excuse the creases and not particularly good photo. When I look at it, I can remember when I stitched certain parts. I did most of the brickwork while waiting for a doctor to come and check my oxygen levels and that little row of motifs under the house took me days and days to do when I was feeling particularly tired.Isn't it a lovely design though? I'm particularly fond of the sheep above the house and I think the wide floral border really sets it off. It's called 'Country Cottage' and was designed by Moira Blackman for Bothy Threads. You can see the design much better on their site.As you can just about see, I added an extra bit at the bottom (where it will be hidden by the frame), saying that I stitched it while ill with Covid. Can you tell I've got an archivist daughter? She's training me to sign everything!"},
{"title": "Living with Covid", "date": "Thursday 30 July 2020", "text": "Hello everyone. It's been a long time since I wrote on here and those of you who are on my ravelry group will understand that the last few months have been particularly hard for me. To put it briefly, I have been looking after my stepfather Bob since he had a fall in January. Sadly, Bob died in April, from a combination of another fall and Covid which he caught while visiting A & E with a 'normal' chest infection.Bob was a lovely man, he made friends wherever he went and everybody loved him. As a friend said to me, Bob was an all too rare example of a genuinely good man. My daughter found this photo of him which sums him up really. Laughing, a packet of crisps in hand (with chocolate cake waiting) and his trusty mobile phone near to hand.Owing to the lockdown, Bobs funeral was a small graveside service with only myself and my son present. Having said that, it was a friendly occasion that I remember with a smile.I expect you can guess what's coming next. The day after Bob died I came down with Covid. As I live on my own, the first few weeks were a frightening time, especially when it got worse after ten days. I got through it though and was glad that I didn't have to go into hospital.Since then I've been recovering at home very slowly. It's been over three months now and I can walk eight lengths of my garden before getting breathless (that's about a tenth of a mile). Apart from the breathlessness, I am very tired all the time and, most days, I have a slight temperature and aches and pains. Oh, and my sense of taste and smell still haven't come back. The other thing that makes life difficult is that my memory and concentration have been affected. I forgot what I'm saying, what I'm doing ... My daughter says it's just as well she can finish my sentences for me as I'm pretty useless at it!I've been in contact with my doctor over the phone during my recovery and, yesterday, she decided enough was enough and that it was time to do some tests on me. Although lots of people are still struggling after several months like me, they need to know if the virus has damaged my lungs or heart and if I've had a mini stroke. So ... yesterday I had an ECG (which was fine) and gave about an armful of blood for all the tests she could think of. Tomorrow I'm having a chest x ray and then she'll arrange some CT scans for me.I'm not up to driving yet but I've been very lucky to have a good friend who drove me to the doctor yesterday and is taking me to the hospital tomorrow. All my friends have been wonderful actually. I've had so many presents and treats sent in the post or left by my door - it's been amazing.I'm very lucky to have a garden so I've been able to sit outside in the fresh air which is lovely. I can do little bits of gardening but can't manage things like cutting the grass. This meant that, until my son and I could be a support bubble, my garden turned into a meadow.The cats loved it. If you look closely you might be able to see them stalking through the grass. It also attracted neighbouring cats who were very pleased to find a new field. The grass is now short again which makes it easier to walk but isn't quite so pretty.Apart from just sitting a lot, I have been doing lots of crafts over the past three months. Knitting is proving tricky - my tension's a bit off and I tend to drop stitches - but I have done quite a lot of sewing. Now that I've 'filled in the gap' I'm hoping to be able to manage short blog posts about some of the things I've made. Using the computer is one of the things that's challenging but I shall try to make it little and often.For those of you who haven't had Covid and perhaps don't know of anyone who has, please do take this virus seriously. It's not like flu and you don't get better quickly. Whatever the government advice, keep your distance from people and stay safe. It's not over yet."},
{"title": "On My Table", "date": "Friday 17 April 2020", "text": "For someone who normally works at home, being out all day, every day for months is proving very challenging. During the few hours I have in the house I have a constant 'to do' list running in my head but it never seems to get any shorter. Being me, there's a creative list as well as the washing, cooking and cleaning one - well, more of a creative pile really ...This is the coffee table in the front room. The coloured bricks and crochet mandalas are normally there but the rest is stuff I'm working on. Apart from the lamb obviously. She was balanced on a table by the window to entertain passing children but the cats had other ideas. Apparently, any table in the window is solely for the use of Linnet and Tolly so I kept coming home to find them sunning themselves there and the lamb on the floor.What shall we start with? My comfort knitting I think.I'm knitting several of these squares a day. They're not a new design (the stitch pattern is one of those I used in Frankie's Blankie) but they are very soothing to work on and the yarn is beautiful. I'm using the Scheepjes Stone and River Washed Colour Pack of 58 little 10g balls of yarn.Each of my squares uses the best part of one ball of yarn, leaving just enough to make a colour peg for future reference. When they're all finished, I'm going to photograph each square so that I can use them as a digital colour tool for planning blankets. Then I'll probably sew them together into two separate blankets, or a blanket and a scarf. There are 58 colours all together which is an awkward number so I'll probably divide them up into the 36 stone and 22 river shades.This particular colour pack is good value I think. It costs about £36 but you could use it to make two yarn advent calendars, something I may well do.There's nearly always a little collection of my Stylecraft Special colour pegs on the table as I play around with ideas.I'd like to do something with really bright colours contrasted with either black or white but, as you can see, I haven't got much further than that thought yet. It would be nice to use some of those neon shades that I normally reject as too bright even for my taste. On the other end of the table is a pile of fabrics waiting to be a quilt.It took me over a week just to get these washed and ironed and then a late night to get the first pieces cut out. I'm going to be hand piecing this one as that means I can get some done up at my stepfather's house during the day.I have another little hand sewing patchwork project on the go (this one's on a tray on top of the piano) but it's a different sort of piecing.I'm using traditional English paper piecing to make these tiny hexagons - the finished sides are only 2 cm long. I cut the paper shapes and the fabric with my trusty Sizzix cutting machine which makes the whole process so much easier. The card shape underneath the patchwork is the pattern for what I'm making, a bigger version of this ...Here's one I made earlier, as they used to say on Blue Peter. This little wallet is just the right size for a mini cross stitch kit like the Mouseloft Stitchlets, making it easy to take some sewing out with me. Lately though, I've felt the need for a bigger version, especially for some of the cover kits from Cross Stitch Crazy magazine so this new one should fit the bill.Too big to fit on the table is my Primrose Garden blanket which is nearly finished now. I'm working on the border; once that's done, I can block it and it'll be ready for a photo shoot. It's too big to take out with me now so I can only work on it at home. During the day I need things to work on that are quite mindless and take up very little room in my bag. This is the little bag for the Scheepjes squares ...I came across this bag in one of my big boxes of old designs and decided it was just the right size for a couple of pairs of needles and some tiny balls of yarn. It's one of a set of little baskets I crocheted about four years ago. There are three different sizes in the pattern; this one is the middle one.Flower BasketsI've also got this drawstring bag with the doings for the mini stockings I knit to go on my Christmas presents each year. So far, four people will be getting stockings on their presents in 2020.I decided I really ought to turn out the folded flower squares that I started knitting with yarn from an advent calendar in (I think) 2017 ... only to find evidence of the dreaded moth. So, they spent a night in the freezer and then had a good wash and are presently drying on top of the fruit cupboard. So called because the fruit bowls go on top of it, not because I have a cupboard full of fruit you understand.Why do I start so many projects involving lots of little pieces in thin yarn? Who knows?So, that's some of the things I'm trying to work on at the moment. How about you?Before I go, I want to thank all the people who are continuing to donate to the Children's Liver Disease Foundation, the charity that I support, during these difficult times. They have had to furlough half their staff due to a sharp drop in donations so, to those who are still able to support them, a very big thank-you."},
{"title": "Warmer World Scarves", "date": "Sunday 5 April 2020", "text": "What do you do when your days are already full of caring duties and it's a major achievement if you can keep on top of the washing and manage to eat each day? You knit two scarves, each using fifteen colours of course. Welcome to my Warmer World Scarves.As I told you recently, I've become fascinated by the idea of illustrating Climate Change with coloured stripes. If you do an image search for Show your Stripes and add the word 'climate', you'll see what I mean. Now I struggled a bit with the maths for this one. I found the data on this page, Climate at a Glance and I understood that all right. I generated a table of the average annual global temperature for each of the 140 years, from 1880 to 2019. The numbers on my table aren't actual temperatures; what they represent is how far the temperature for each year deviated from the average annual global temperature for the whole of the twentieth century. So, if the average temperature for any year was the same as that for the years 1901 - 2000, it would appear as 0º Celsius. The range of numbers on my chart is from -0.46º to 0.99º so I divided them up into fifteen bands, each covering 0.1º ... she says, casually. This is where I got hopelessly confused and had to call in an expert (that would be my mathematician son). I'm fine with positive decimal numbers but when we get to negative numbers I just can't cope. I'd like to blame it on the fact that we didn't go decimal here in the UK until I was ten years old but, in reality, I think it's just me. After all, I had no problems with changing to 'new money' and I happily work with both imperial and metric weight measurements - metric for knitting, imperial for cooking and weighing babies.Anyway, once I'd wrestled my data into fifteen numbered bands, then came the fun part of assigning them each a colour. Back into my comfort zone again. I used my trusty Stylecraft Special DK and the colour pegs I use to plan my designs. I wanted the negative numbers to be shades of blue and the positive ones to be red but there were five bands below zero and ten above and there just weren't that many reds. So I settled for pinks and reds for the warmer colours.The original scarf was going to be for my son who started me off on this project and he wanted a really long one (think Tom Baker's Doctor Who). I decided to keep it simple and knit it in garter stitch. To avoid a regular colour blip on one side when changing colours, I worked seven rows for each year stripe so that those blips would appear on both sides. This also had the advantage of sharing the tails of yarn between both edges of the scarf. Because I like number patterns within my designs, I worked on a multiple of seven too - 49 stitches.The disadvantage of having an odd number of rows is that it's harder to keep track of where you are, so I needed a row counter so I didn't get lost. I ticked off each year as I knitted it and made myself darn in the yarn tails after finishing each decade. I absolutely loved knitting this scarf. Despite it's size, I didn't get bored once. Instead, I found it quite meditative as I thought about each year as I knitted it and remembered things that happened, either personally or on a global scale. There was a sort of shiver when I got to World War Two and suddenly switched to warmer colours and as for all those family birthdays ...  Here's the finished scarf.My son was pleased with his scarf. He wears it wrapped twice round his neck and it looks great. I wanted to include a photo of it being worn but, as I only see him occasionally at a distance of two metres when he drops off shopping ... Having finished the scarf, I then set about knitting another one, this time on a smaller scale. I went for multiples of four this time - so four rows per year and 40 stitches on the needle. Having an even number of rows in each stripe would make the colour blips appear all on one side so I made the first row of each stripe a K1. P1 row to hide this. I do like my scarves to look good on both sides. This resulted in a very pleasing stitch pattern with one ridge per year on one side and two on the other. Entirely unplanned but I wasn't complaining.That band of pink is the seven years of the war, 1939-1945.I enjoyed the knitting just as much the second time round. If you look closely, you can see that I've added a ruler to the side of the scarf to make it easier to count off the years. It might look more balanced to have this on both edges of the scarves but I couldn't be bothered.I'm hoping that lots of people will knit their own Warmer World Scarves, using my pattern as a starting point. I'd love to see them at the next Climate Change school strike protests - once it's safe to take to the streets again, obviously. In the meantime, get knitting!"},
{"title": "Two Georges", "date": "Thursday 26 March 2020", "text": "My seventh birthday, over fifty years ago, is one that I remember particularly clearly. Partly because it was the first one I'd had to go to school on. My birthday is at the end of October which means that it often falls at half term. I don't think I normally had a party for my birthday but, that year, I had two. There was one at the weekend for my friends ...That's me at the back in the blue dress and alice band, next to my best friend Heather (also wearing an alice band, that's how you know we were best friends). Heather emigrated to Australia about five years later and I haven't seen her since. If you look closely you can see the yellow Harlequin plates that were part of my Mum and Dad's wedding china. I still have some of that left and use it regularly.Anyway, I also had a very special party on my actual birthday although, sadly, there are no photographs. I got off the school bus to find all my favourite dolls (including Hoppity the Space Hopper) grouped round a table full of miniature party food for me to share with them - tiny sandwiches, baby cakes ... I can still picture it and remember how excited I was when I saw it. My Mum was good at that sort of thing; I can also see her on another day, holding up my Tiny Tears doll to show me that she'd made her a new dress during the day.I still treasure my Tiny Tears who now has to rely on me for new dresses.You may be wondering where the Georges come in to this story. Well, the first was actually Georgie and he's a nightdress case. He was my seventh birthday present from Mum and Dad so he was an honoured guest at my dolls' birthday party. Here I am with him ...You can just about see my 'I am 7' badge.And the second George? He arrived in the post last weekend as a Mother's Day present from my daughter. I didn't know that Merrythought made other hedgehogs in the same family but meet small George ...Isn't he lovely? He seems to have made friends with my original Georgie and he makes me smile every time I see him.As you can tell, I was one of those children who really love their dolls - they were (and possibly still are) real to me. I might show you some of the others that I've kept one day."},
{"title": "Juggling", "date": "Tuesday 17 March 2020", "text": "No, not that sort of juggling. My son taught himself to juggle years ago (a very useful skill now he's a primary school teacher I always think) but I've never mastered it.The juggling I'm talking about will be familiar to you all - the sort that involves juggling work, family and all sorts of other commitments. In my case, I'm trying to combine looking after my stepfather (who is getting much stronger now) with designing, housework and music. Oh, and the cats would like me to tell you that I've been neglecting them for months too.Over the last couple of months, I've had precisely one day off from caring. My daughter had planned to come up and take over for a couple of days recently but then she came down with That Virus so, obviously, couldn't go anywhere. She's better now and my son and I are managing, together with the support of some wonderful professional carers. That would be some of the carers who the government classes as unskilled workers and who are now working as normal to help the most vulnerable people during this crisis. Enough said.Anyway, the house is a mess and I still haven't had time to pick up my violin but I am managing to get some work done on several designs, swapping them round as the occasion demands. Want to see what I'm doing?Do you remember me telling you last year about my search for the right colour scheme for a crochet blanket? You can read about it here. Well, I ended up settling for shades of yellow and green, reminiscent of Spring primroses.I've been making quite a lot of progress with this one lately. I've decided that it needs to be biggish to show off the 3D effect so I'm making 25 of the squares and filling in with lots and lots of long hexagons. So far I've done three out of the five 'rows' and I even know how I'm going to finish off the edge.Those squares are flush with the rest of the blanket, not laid on top.I've got another textured crochet design on the go too. This one is, at the  moment, called 'Blooming Flowers'.Again, I experimented with lots of really quite ugly colour combinations before settling on shades of pink. Not to mention making a lot of lumpy squares; that green border was harder to work out than you might think. Then, when I put the squares together, all that texture was just a bit too much. The yellow sashing is crocheted on to avoid lots of sewing and (hopefully) tones the whole thing down a bit.I bought some old wooden workbag handles in a charity shop a few years ago - you can read about that particular treasure hunt here - so I'm going to turn my flower squares into a pretty workbag. That panel of twelve squares will be one side of the bag, the other side will be the same and then I'll probably make up the rest with simple stripes.I'm enjoying working on both of these projects but the thing that's really grabbed me lately is my Climate Change scarf. My son was telling me about Ed Hawkins' Warming Stripes which represent the earth's rising temperature in coloured stripes and I immediately wanted to turn the data into a scarf.This is my 'first draft' - a long, garter stitch scarf, representing global warming from 1880 to 2019. The data I used takes the global average temperature for the period 1901 - 2000 and then sees how each year's average temperature deviates from this base temperature. There are fifteen colour bands, each one representing  0.1º Celsius; those bands below 0º are shades of blue and those above are pinks and reds. As you can see, the scarf illustrates the way our world's temperature has risen over the past 140 years but this has turned out to be a much more exciting project than just that. As I knitted, I found myself thinking about each year as I got to it, remembering global events and also family birthdays. It turned out to be very calming and therapeutic. There were also some interesting surprises along the way. There are only five shades of blue and ten of pink / red but for nearly sixty years the scarf is completely blue. Warmer colours start to appear by the 1940s but it's only from the late 1970s onwards that the blues disappear and the rest of the scarf becomes a race through all the pinks and reds.The first block of pinks in the scarf represents the years 1939 - 1945, the Second World War. This shook me. You can also spot particularly hard winters, like that of 1963-4, when a long patch of pink is followed by a bright blue stripe. I've promised this scarf to my son but he can''t have it until I've taken all the photos I might want for the pattern.I've now started a shorter version of the scarf, using a slightly different stitch pattern so that you can count the years more easily to read the information in it. I may or may not add ruler-like lines to one edge to mark the years too. Once I've knitted this one, I think I'll work out a pattern for a crochet version too. At the moment I'm calling them 'Warmer World' scarves. What do you think?"},
{"title": "2020 is Postponed", "date": "Saturday 7 March 2020", "text": "2020 started off so well. I made three New Year's Resolutions this year:1. To practise my clarinet regularly. I had it repaired last year and am now re-learning how to play it after a gap of about thirty years.2. To teach myself shorthand. No idea why, it's just something that I thought would be fun to do. Inspired by Long Live Pitman's Shorthand which is a treasure trove of information and advice, I assembled a few supplies ...3. To fit work round the rest of my life rather than the other way round. This is something I've been working on for the last few years. I enjoy designing but that means that it's very easy to end up spending all your waking hours doing it. Especially when, if I don't publish a pattern for a few weeks, people start to ask if I'm all right. One day, I'm going to do a breakdown of the amount of hours it takes to design and publish a pattern. Just because something is quick and easy to knit doesn't mean it's quick to design. End of rant.Anyway, for the first two weeks of January things were going quite smoothly. I was managing a short clarinet practice most days as well as keeping up with my longer violin practices. I hadn't actually started on the shorthand but, as you can see, I'd printed out the first lesson, all ready to go.The work / life balance wasn't too bad either. I find that making time to actually leave the house and do something different occasionally makes the work go better too. I had a lovely trip to Bramble Patch, my local quilt shop. My rotary cutter has been slowly dying for ages. I replaced the blade before realising that something was out of alignment and it was high time to buy a new one. This one has a button lock which I like and it cuts through the fabric so easily.The fabric and webbing is for a bag. I've been making my reversible tote bags for ages and thought it was about time I designed a new basic bag. The plan is to try making a roomy shoulder bag, this time lined with wadding. Not sure if it will be reversible or not as that may make it too complicated to do.Anyway, this is all academic as that pile of fabric is still sitting on my work table, waiting to be unfolded. In the middle of January my eighty year old Stepfather had a fall and ended up in hospital for two weeks. He wasn't badly hurt and recovered well but was finally persuaded that he needed some help at home from regular carers. He has very bad arthritis in his knees, arms and hands so everyday tasks are difficult and take ages. While we were waiting for everything to be set up, we had a good sort out at his house, making it ready for him to come home.Things went well for the first three weeks after hospital; I started off being there all day but, gradually, he was able to do more and we were getting into a routine which meant I could eat a hot meal at my house every day and do some work. I even got back to practising my violin and was thinking I might be nearly ready to start my lessons again.Then he had another fall, this time putting his head through the glass back door. Carers were with him at the time so they called me and the ambulance and then we all waited an hour and a half for it to arrive. He had two deep cuts on his head which they glued back together in A & E before sending him home. Now you'd think that would have left him with a serious headache but no, he said it just felt a bit sore. They obviously made them tough in 1939. The fall knocked him for six in other ways though and we had a rough few weeks before he started to get better again. My son and I have been sharing the care - I do the days and he does evenings and nights. I think he's really tuned the corner now so that's a big relief.So, if you've been wondering why I've been so quiet since January and haven't been publishing much, now you know. I have been doing bits of work as and when I can but it's very slow. I had nearly finished this reversible scarf in early January and finally managed to get it done and published.Double Up ScarfThis is much more complicated than most of my patterns. I normally aim for simple designs that most people can have a go at but I was fascinated by Nancy Marchant's book Knitting Brioche and used one of the simpler stitch patterns to knit a double sided scarf. It took me about half the scarf before I finally got the hang of it and stopped making mistakes.I then looked round for some portable knitting to work on in odd moments and unearthed my pile of triangles.Looking back through my pattern notebooks (there are fifteen of them so far), I found that I'd started this project in February 2018 and had been working on it off and on ever since. Definitely time to get it done. Anyway, several weeks later I had all 150 little triangles done and was ready to assemble them. This would have normally taken me a day or so, taking photos as I went but, as I had to wait to be at my house in daylight (and where my big photography lights live), I could only photograph one stage per day - sometimes every few days. It was like building a kaleidoscope ...And here is the finished thing ...I've called it Seven Sisters after the traditional quilt pattern which was presumably named for The Pleiades. My finished hexagon is about 96 cm across at its widest, big enough to do duty as a table covering but you could easily use it as a blanket pattern. Either knit more stars or use thicker yarn to make it bigger.The yarn I used is Schoppel-Wolle Edition 3, a DK weight yarn which comes in some beautiful, subtly shaded colourways. These are the two that I used ...The star colour is shade 2296, English Garden and I used shade 2298 Wash Day for the background triangles. This yarn is one of my favourites ever; I shall definitely be using it again.With such a geometric project the normal 'drape it here and there in a vaguely artistic way' approach to photography wasn't going to work. Instead, I had a lovely time folding the knitting into all sorts of shapes.Much to my delight, I got home yesterday evening to find that this pattern had reached Number One on the ravlery 'hot right now' list. It was number seven first thing in the morning but I  don't have access to the internet at my Stepfather's house so I asked my friends on my ravelry group to keep an eye on the list for me. As normal, they rose to the challenge so a big thank-you to them all, especially Isolde. And thank-you to everyone who looked at the pattern page and thereby pushed it up the list. There was a bit of happy dancing going on here last night.I'm now concentrating on two crochet designs - both heavily textured - and yesterday I started knitting a climate change scarf. This last one is going to be quite quick to do I think now that I've worked out all the maths behind it. Mind you, when I say I've worked it out, what I actually mean is that my son has patiently explained it to me several times and I've made notes. I've never been comfortable with negative decimal numbers so I have to keep checking them with him. So far I've knitted to the end of the nineteenth century - only 120 years to go. I'll take some photos to show you when I get time ..."},
{"title": "Starting and Finishing", "date": "Tuesday 14 January 2020", "text": "Hello everybody and I hope that the new year is treating you well. I thought I'd start my first blog post of 2020 by showing you one of my favourite Christmas presents.My daughter made me these felt ornaments of Oliver and Amanda Pig from the much loved children's books. Written by Jean Van Leeuwen and illustrated by Ann Schweninger, you can read about the origins of the stories here. I hadn't realised that Oliver and Amanda were inspired by the author's children, David and Elizabeth.We have two big baskets of treasured Christmas picture books that we bring out every year and 'Oliver and Amanda's Christmas' is one of our favourites.In the five stories in this book, Oliver and Amanda make presents, help choose a Christmas tree and bake some fat biscuits. Oliver gets carried away with how many presents he thinks he needs, at one point deciding he'll need to hang up a big tablecloth rather than a stocking, but the arrival of Grandma with new hand knitted stockings calms him down. In the last story they celebrate Christmas and the little pigs play with their new toys, including a doll and a fire truck. 'Amanda rocked Patsy Ann in her arms. Oliver put out a fire under the piano.' As you do.Here's the illustration of Amanda Pig carrying home the little nest that they find in their Christmas tree.You can see how well my felt decoration matches the original. My daughter tells me that there will be more felt ornaments of children's book characters to come in future years so I'm going to get a mini tree to put them all on. Apparently, I'm not allowed to make requests but, if you're reading this Rose, Alpaca!Anyway, this lovely present reminded me of my plan, many years ago when the children were small, to embroider pictures of characters from children's books. I started off bravely with this patchwork Elmer. I drew the elephant and then worked each square in different needlepoint stitches. The whole thing is quite small - my eyesight was a lot better then.I then rashly decided to fill in the background with tiny green stitches ... which is why it never got finished. It took me quite a while to find it in the bottom of a basket of half-finished projects and I'm pleased to see that there's not actually that much more to do. Now that I've got my wonderful magnifying craft light, I should be able to finish the background and then outline Elmer with a bit of backstitch.Maybe I'll start on another one once Elmer's finished. I though a blackwork picture of Rosie from Rosie's Walk would be good (although using the colours of the illustrations) so that's next on my list.I have an awful lot of things that I started and never got round to finishing so, this year, I'm going to try to get some of them done. I have quite a few cross stitch pictures ready to frame, for example. I've even bought some of the frames so there's no excuse for not doing them.This little 3D gingerbread house was a project in an issue of 'World of Cross Stitching' from 2016.I finished the stitching that year but, two Christmases later, I still hadn't put the house together. So, earlier this month, I spent an evening doing that and, apart from attaching the roof which was tricky, it went together quite easily. Doesn't it look nice?I finished it just in time to put it away with the rest of the Christmas decorations but I shall enjoy getting it out next year.Here's another project that's been waiting to be finished for a while, this time a needlepoint decoration.This is one of a series of six decorations that I bought together as a kit.I'd only managed to actually finish one, the Christmas tree, but now I have two to hang on my tree.I also managed to finish my weaving advent calendar that I showed you last month. I wove 24 squares and sewed them together to make a small blanket. Determined to use up all the odd lengths of yarn, I crocheted a random border all round it (Oh, all those ends to sew in) and then gave it a good blocking. This transformed it from an uneven hotchpotch into something quite respectable.Its the right size to go on my coffee table but, at the moment, its draped over the back of one of my chairs like a modern day antimacasser.I still have some more squares to weave for the border of my temperature blanket from last year too. They're not very exciting so I keep putting them off but it will be nice to finish it. Im looking forward to showing it to you all once it's done.I've started a UFO (unfinished objects) group on ravelry for mutual support and encouragement. It turns out that I'm not the only one who doesn't finish stuff. If you'd like to deal with some of your lurking UFOs this year - any craft welcome - then do come and join us. Unfinished Objects 2020"},
{"title": "Merry Christmas", "date": "Wednesday 25 December 2019", "text": "Hello everyone and a very Merry Christmas to you all.I'm just popping in to introduce my new pattern, published today as an extra gift to all the knitters who like my weird ideas.Tetrahedrons is one of my oddities - patterns that are difficult to classify. Basically, these are tiny knitted shapes which can be sewn together to make decorations or anything else you can think of.Personally, I started off by putting them in a bowl and playing with them from time to time. Then I took six and sewed them together to make a flexagon. You can fiddle with this endlessly, making it into different shapes.And then I discovered - oh, joy of joys - that it fitted on my wrist too. I had a lot of trouble taking this photo. Trying to position one arm so that the knitting shows up properly while holding the camera steady with the other hand ...The clever part about this pattern is that the shapes are knitted as double layers so they don't turn into shapeless lumps when they're stuffed. I was rather pleased with that idea. If you've never tried the double knitting technique - slip stitches, two separate layers knitted at once - then this pattern would be a good place to start.Anyway, have fun with it and enjoy your Christmas."},
{"title": "Advent Calendars", "date": "Sunday 22 December 2019", "text": "Throughout what has been a very busy December (a General Election in December  - whose bright idea was that?), my rare moments of calm have involved these lovely things.I absolutely love advent calendars and this year's have been particularly good. As a child I remember the excitement of taking turns with my brother to open a door each day and see the picture inside. Did everyone share an advent calendar with their siblings in the 1960s or was it just us? Anyway, I still enjoy a traditional picture calendar each year, even if I find it increasingly difficult to read the numbers on the doors. Last year's was particularly entertaining as Waitrose had commissioned one which had, as well as the numbers on the door, the number of days until Christmas printed at the top of each picture. Unfortunately, the numbers inside didn't match those on the doors so, for example, on the 2nd December, it was apparently only 16 days until Christmas. This made me laugh every day as we jumped back and forth through the month, although it must have been confusing for children. Anyway, this year my picture calendar is a very small one that I bought at the RSC two years ago and then promptly forgot all about.As you can see, it's a traditional street scene spread over four sides. The numbers are actually dark enough for me to be able to read and there's space inside the walls for a battery operated tea light. The one I got actually flickers (how do they do that?) so it looks very realistic. When lit, the light shows through the open windows. It's hard to catch this in a photo but I had a go.I also light a real candle every day in advent. I used to buy one of those advent candles with the days marked on them but it always proved rather too stressful. Either I forgot it and burnt several days by mistake or I didn't light it at all and ended up with a week to burn at the end. So now I just burn a tea light each day. The candle holder I normally use was the thing I couldn't find this year so I've been using this little angel one where the heat from the candle makes the angels spin.You can't see them well in this photo but each angel is carrying something different: a tree, a star, a candle and a trumpet.All very lovely but the real excitement this year has been my craft calendars - both home made. First of all, I used leftover Shetland 4  ply from 21st Century Yarns to make a weaving calendar.Each of these little balls weighs about 5g and, if I didn't have enough of any one colour, I combined two in one ball. The yarn is doubled to give me the thickness I wanted on my chosen loom. My son then wrapped the balls in tissue paper and attached numbered tags so that I didn't know which colour I would be getting each day - the element of surprise is a big part of the joy of advent calendars, I think.I've been weaving a four inch square each day, using my Hazel Rose multi loom and then slip stitching round the edge with a crochet hook.After Christmas, I'll sew them all together to make a mini blanket. Want to see more of the colours?There are tiny balls of each yarn left after the weaving so I might have enough to give my blanket a random crochet border. Hazel's looms are great fun to use and very compulsive. If you're in the UK, both Wild Fibres and Weft Blown stock them.I've left the best of this year's advent calendars until last, even though it nearly ground to a halt in the first week of December.My daughter put together this mystery cross stitch calndar for me as my birthday present in October and I was very excited about getting started on it. Each of the numbered envelopes had a numbered part of the chart to stick on to the big piece of card but I had no idea what the overall picture was going to be.All went well to start with. Day one was a roof.Over the next few days, I added the rest of the house, several hills  and a tree. And then I realised that the fabric was going to be too small to add the next part of the picture! Cue anxious texts between me and my daughter and a frantic search of the house to find another, bigger piece of linen so that I could start again. Needless to say, I didn't have any and, anyway, didn't much fancy stitching the first few days all over again. So, I put it away sadly, thinking I might do it next year instead. And then, on the 7th December, I got an email from my daughter with this picture attached.She'd got a bigger piece of fabric and had spent a long evening stitching the days I'd already done on to it. She then sent it up to me with a friend who was visiting her that day so I didn't have to wait for the post. Wasn't that brilliant? Really, like a double present.Now that I didn't have to re-do the first five days, it didn't take me long to catch up and, since then, I've been really enjoying stitching each day's chart. I treated myself to a super duper new light for cross stitching when I saw it reduced in Hobbycraft and it's made it so much easier. It's the Purelite 4 in 1 Crafters Magnifying Lamp and has really revolutionised my stitching. As well as the light and the magnification, there's a little attachment to hold your chart which is very handy. It isn't the most attractive of lights (especially in my old house) so I take the top section with the stick and lamp on off when I'm not using it. There's always the risk of the magnifier setting light to the furniture (or the cats) if the sunshine catches it too.So, back to the actual cross stitch picture. It became apparent quite early on that it was a sampler which of course makes it much harder to guess what's coming next as things can be placed fairly randomly. After stitching this star, for example, I was convinced that the little curl next to it was the end of a sleigh runner.It seemed obvious - a sleigh in the sky above the house, but no. This was what that part of the chart turned out to be ...Here's what the chart looked like a couple of days ago ...And here's the stitching to match ...Since then I've added the word 'Christmas' (I did guess that one you'll be glad to hear) and a stocking next to it.I'm really enjoying the combination of cross stitch and redwork; I love patterns made up of straight lines and there are lots in this picture. Just look at all the detail on the hills. It's going to be a beautiful picture once it's finished. I can't decide whether to frame it or to turn it into a quilted hanging with a fabric border. Something like this one which I made a couple of years ago.Then there's the matter of which colour to frame it with. Red seems the obvious choice but maybe it's too obvious. Decisions, decisions."},
{"title": "It's that time of year ...", "date": "Friday 29 November 2019", "text": "... when my Advent series of patterns is launched on to the unsuspecting world. It gets harder each year to come up with a new idea that is a) Christmassy, b) can be divided into parts and c) is something I haven't already done.This year's offering was inspired by Victorian needle boxes where you lifted the lid off to reveal pockets for needles and a thimble in the middle. Mine has something a bit more exciting than a thimble inside.It took me quite a while to work out how to make a knitted tree stand up on its own (a floppy tree is really not a good look). Eventually, I used an old, thin knitting needle pushed up through the middle - what's the betting I forget I've done that and spend ages looking for that other 2 mm needle one day? Actually, you could just knit the tree on its base as a decoration on its own; I'm very tempted to knit another one to display separately. Because of course you can never have too many knitted Christmas trees.For the purposes of this pattern though, the box is actually a house. Here's the front ...The climbing plant is meant to be a clematis. I found there's a white one that flowers at Christmas called 'Jingle Bells' - you can't say I don't research my knitted flowers thoroughly. I'm particulalry proud of the little snowman and the old fashioned street light on one of the side walls too.It's hard to design a convincing snowman when he's only about an inch tall, while, at the same time, trying to make him a bit different from all the other snowmen you've designed over the years.Fancy knitting your own Christmas House this year? The first pattern, for the basic structure, is available here and the rest of the patterns will be published on alternate days during December, starting on Sunday, 1st December. I always have a job deciding how many patterns to divide these big designs into; this year 12 was a better fit than 24. A couple of the patterns are pretty big (including the tree) but they will be published quite early in the month.As normal, knitters will be chatting about this pattern series on my ravelry group and sharing photos of their progress. Do come and join in - even if you don't have time to knit the house this year, you can admire others' work.I've been getting things ready for my own  advent calendars too. I've got a cross stitch one that my daughter made me and a weaving one that I put together myself. Then there's a little picture one that I bought a couple of years ago and promptly lost. I'm pretty sure I know where it is ..."},
{"title": "To the Sea", "date": "Thursday 14 November 2019", "text": "I don't know if it's got something to do with living on an island (even if it is a big one) but I do feel a strong link to the sea and get fidgety if I haven't seen it for a long time. I suspect I'm not alone in feeling like this; you only have to look at the special place The Shipping Forecast has in our hearts. Viking, North Utsire, South Utsire, Forties, Cromarty, Forth ...' - it sounds like a poem, doesn't it? What with that and 'Sailing By' (which is the music played before the last Shipping Forecast of the day on Radio 4), is it any wonder that, as a nation, we love the sea? This music takes me back thirty years to the many nights when I listened to it while trying to get my first baby to sleep. You'd think it would have made a good lullaby but it never seemed to work.Anyway, fast forward a few decades and that baby and I, together with his little sister, have just had a wonderful week's holiday down in Dorset. We used to go there regularly for holidays in autumn half term (when it was cheaper) and decided to go again this year (still in half term as my son is a teacher). I hadn't had a holiday for years so this was very special.Now the British seaside in the last week of October is never going to be hot ... or dry ... and you can't even count on the cliffs staying where they were last time you looked. Here's the sign that welcomes you to Charmouth beach.Don't get me wrong, we love Charmouth. The fact that it's rugged and rough appeals to us. You never know what the beach is going to be like from one day to another; it can be sandy, stony or a combination of both, depending on the weather. The walking is great, there are fossils to find and the sea is never boring. This was the sea on our first night; the waves were crashing a very long way up and, as you can see from the stones, this wasn't even high tide.This was the view across to Lyme, about half an hour later ...This sea was as nothing to the one on the day we left, a week later. Gale force winds were blowing throughout the South West and the sea was huge. The beach huts are set back from the sea at Charmouth for obvious reasons and the wind had managed to blow one completely over.We were lucky in that those two days, at the start and end of our holiday, saw the worst of the weather so we managed to fit in quite a few good walks on the days in between.You can walk along the beach from Charmouth to Lyme at low tide but, for some reason, we'd never done this before. It's an easy walk and oh, so beautiful.The beach varied from big stones to pebbles to sand, with lots of rock pools too.In this part of the world, the stones themselves often hide surprises ...We thought the group of people we passed as we reached Lyme were admiring an exciting fossil find but no, it turned out to be an old grenade - apparently they turn up quite regularlyWe collected lots of lovely sea glass on this walk, it seemed to be everywhere. We found out later in the week that the sea uncovered an old rubbish dump here a while ago so that would probably explain all the glass.The Tuesday of our week was my birthday and we'd planned a coast walk for that day. Rain was forecast but we decided to go anyway and just turn back if  it got too bad. In the event, although the wind got up and it threatened to rain all day, we only had a few showers and the walk was lovely.You can't say I dont know how to celebrate my birthday in style.We started at West Bay and followed the coast path through Eype and Seatown and up Golden Cap. A digression here - have you noticed how all those links take you to pictures of sunny beaches and people in light dresses? Needless to say, they're nothing like that in winter. Mind you, the chips at West Bay harbour are the best I've tasted and the countryside is stunning all year round. See that note on the Golden Cap link about Gabriel's Steps being closed? They were a steep flight of muddy steps up the cliff that was part of one of our favourite walks. The last time we tried to do it they'd collapsed and we had to pick our way over huge boulders at low tide to get round to Seatown.Anyway, back to our walk. It was steep and muddy and cold but we were sustained by chocolate rations and regular stops. We came across this lovely old stone watering place where we stopped for a breather ..... and a surpise birthday cake! I thought my daughter was taking a long time rooting some biscuits out of the rucksack and then she produced this ...One large piece of Dorset apple cake, complete with candelabra and candles. It was too windy to get the candles to light but I pretended to blow them out anyway.We've re-named that place 'Birthday Cake Well' now. We do that a lot (yes, we are big Arthur Ransome fans); we also stopped at 'Cow Pat Bench' later on this walk.By the time we got near the top of Golden Cap, the wind was really picking up. You only have to look at the trees to see how rough it can get here.Those trees look like they're walking up the cliff, don't they? From the top we came back down to the sea at Seatown for a cold picnic by the sea and then took a different (and very muddy) route back to West Bay. We were walking for about five hours all together and the light was just starting to fade by the end of it but it was a wonderful walk.There was more mud and rain on the Friday when my son and I did the last walk of the holiday (my daughter had to go back home for work on Thursday). We parked on the cliff above Beer and walked along the coast path to Branscombe and back.That's the view back to Beer which is a beautiful fishing village; there were great views along the coast all the way. Coming in to Branscombe, we had to go down this flight of very steep, very muddy steps ...We managed these all right but then, at the bottom of them, was a steep slope of slippery mud. It must have taken us ten minutes to make our way very slowly down that particular stretch of the path. Needless to say, we decided to find a route inland back to Beer which was still muddy and steep but not quite so bad.Beer is a lovely village, with its sheltered harbour and interesting buildings. This row of houses was on the road back up to the car. I lived in a brick and flint house as a child so I have a particular fondness for them. Here's our old house (in Longstock in Hampshire).Are you still with me? This is a long post but I've got a few more things I want to share with you from my holiday.My birthday, for example. There were other excitements, as well as our walk. We started the day with a picnic breakfast on the beach - Jurassic Foot Bread (a date bread), fig rolls and chocolate - plus a cup of tea for me).I had my presents in the evening - lots of lovely things but I'll just show you one of the more unusual and exciting ones; it's from my daughter.It's a cross stitch Advent Calendar! There are 24 numbered envelopes and each one has part of the chart in. I stick the chart over the shape on the plan with the matching number and stitch just that part each day. I have no idea what the finished picture is going to be and, as you can see, it only uses one colour. I can't wait to get started on this. I wonder how long it will take me to guess what its going to be. Please don't tell me if you think you know what it might be as I want to work it out for myself. I'll show you how it's going next month.We had a birthday curry and the candelabra and candles made another appearance, this time fully lit.I think I look like my Granny in this picture; my children think I just look very small.I spent quite a bit of money on my holiday, mostly in secondhand bookshops. We went to two of our favourites: Bridport Old Books and Chapter House Books in Sherborne. Funnily enough, both places also have really good bakeries - Leakers in Bridport and Reeve in Sherborne. That seems to me a perfect combination - good books and lovely bread and cakes.I'll just show you a couple of my purchases; firstly a nice old knitting book (obviously) ...This is an Odhams book but in a bigger format than normal (and yes, I think that's interesting). I also got some more Puffin Picture Books to add to my growing collection, and this was one of several new / old music books I found.In a secondhand bookshop in Honiton - Graham York Rare Books they sell paper ephemera as well as books and I got these lovely old cards.As you can see, these are children's birthday cards but I got some others too.I can't decide whether to frame them, scan them to use the images in craft projects or actually use them as cards. I'll probably do a bit of everything.There was a bit of knitting related shopping too. I got some new yarn ...... and lots of lovely old knitting patterns.We visited a small art gallery in Beer (Marine House at Beer) where we discovered the work of a new (to us) artist, Adrian Sykes. I was very taken by his paintings which are full of colour and stories. I bought the catalogue of his 2018 exhibition which has pictures of more than twenty of his works.You can open it at any page and find a treasure.This is one of my favourites; it's called 'Where the Mountains meet the Sea' and, if you look closely, you can see that the people are playing violins.Finally, on our journey home, I got two nice pieces of china, both in Crewkerne. This little fruit bowl was in a charity shop; I love this sort of old-fashioned country cottage pattern.And then, in an antiques shop, I found this beautiful little trio by Beswick.Perhaps best known for their china animals and Beatrix Potter figures, this was part of a 1950s tea service called 'Dancing Days'. It is even prettier in real life; The pink is a very delicate shade and the saucer and plate have lovely, wavy edges. I'm using this set a lot at the moment.Speaking of which, it's time for me to stop talking and go and put the kettle on. I hope you've enjoyed this little diary of my holiday. I'm off again next week, this time to stay with a friend in Cornwall so I'm keeping my fingers crossed for kind weather again."},
{"title": "Shawl for Faye", "date": "Monday 14 October 2019", "text": "In a follow up to my last post, I've finished the Granny shawl I showed you.Shawl for Faye is the result of a request from a crocheter who saw my Great Granny blanket pattern and asked how to make a triangular shawl in the same way. It just so happened that she caught me when I was missing having the blanket to work on so I said yes. I never normally design to order so this was a first.When I looked into it, I found that there were lots of variations on working a simple Granny triangle so I played about until I had a version that was as simple to work as possible. I wanted to avoid any of those 'work into the top of the starting chain' instructions as they're always a pain. So, in my pattern, you only ever work stitches into the top of other stitches or into chain spaces - nice and easy.I used eight shades of red, pink and brown for my shawl, plus a contrast colour to tie them all together. I used this contrast after a certain number of colours, much in the same way as I had for the blanket. The yarn is Stylecraft Special DK; I use this yarn such a lot. It's cheap, good quality and comes in a big range of colours. As I have colour pegs of all of them, choosing colours for a new project is easy.I always think that the top edge of a crochet Granny triangle can look a bit unfinished so I added the border and edging to all three sides of my shawl. This is basically the same pattern as that on the blanket, although I had to adjust it a bit to allow for the different tension along the top edge.I enjoyed making this shawl just as much as I did the blanket. It gave me the same necessary colour fix and, as a bonus, it was much, much quicker. I hope some of you (and especially, Faye) give this one a go and enjoy it as much as I did."},
{"title": "New Ideas", "date": "Monday 7 October 2019", "text": "Whenever I finish working on a big design, I always feel the need to start new things. It doesn't matter how many projects I've got on the go, it's as if getting something done frees up space in my brain for new ideas. This last week I finally got all the proofreading done on this year's Christmas series and I also finished my crochet Granny Square blanket. That's two big things out of the way at once so, obviously, I've been bombarded with new ideas and I thought you might like to see a few of them.You can see where the idea for this one came from. Having just finished a giant Granny square blanket, I still hadn't had enough of this simple technique. A crocheter actually sent me a request for a pattern for a simple Granny triangle shawl and although I don't normally design to order, this happened to coincide with my need to keep crocheting groups of trebles. At least this one should be a lot quicker to make.I've got another crochet shawl on the go at the moment but it's evolving into a strange shape ...This sort of thing happens a lot when you make it up as go along; you just have to work with it. I suspect that curved top edge will resolve itself into a design feature - a rolled collar perhaps?Here's another shawl that I'm letting do its own thing, this time a knitted one.I was prompted to start this one by a technique I worked out for one of my little Christmas patterns. And no, I'm not going to tell you what that pattern is! Anyway, I think I could also use the same technique as the basis for a picture frame but I'm resisting starting that one for the time being.The shawl is twisting round nicely at the moment; it remains to be seen whether it will behave itself so well when I get to the other side. I'm going to call this one 'Whirligig' (or possibly 'Whirlygig'). Isn't the yarn lovely? It's Stylecraft Cabaret and it's a beautifully soft yarn with a bit of added sparkle. A few years ago, I made my Lucky Shawl with autumnal shades of this yarn and was glad to discover that it's still around.Lucky ShawlFor the past few days I've been knitting lots of little samples for this scarf, trying to find the right yarn for one of the colours.I'm using an exciting double-sided brioche technique which calls for double pointed needles. The stitch pattern is the same on the other side but the colours are reversed. The first problem I had was finding long enough needles in the size I wanted. Mine were just that bit too short and I kept pushing the stitches off the end. I resolved this problem by the simple expedient of going up a needle size - I had longer 4 mm double pointed needles for some reason.Then there was the yarn. I started off with the variegated one which is a ball of Sirdar Jewelspun, a new aran weight yarn that caught my eye in a wool shop recently.I chose this rich autumnal colourway (shade 843) and then looked for a plain yarn to contrast with it. I tried cream, I tried navy blue, I tried grey, I tried black, I tried gold ... you get the idea. Eventually, I came upon this purple, soft yarn in Wilkinsons of all places. According to the ball band, it should be quite a lot thicker than the variegated one but they're both quite softly spun and seem to go together well. I did the 'twist the yarns together and run your fingers over it' test and they passed. To do this, make a loop in one yarn, pass the other one through it so you have two, linked loops. Then twist them both and run your fingers across the join. If it's smooth, then they'll work to a similar tension. This would be easier to explain with a picture, hang on a minute ...Anyway, back to the scarf. I found the technique in the excellent Knitting Brioche by Nancy Marchant. This book is a wonderful resource, full of detailed stitch patterns and some lovely patterns to use them with too. I've used a very basic brioche stitch for my scarf but there are lots more. I see she's published further books using this fascinating technique; I must look out for them.As normal, I've got several blanket patterns on the go, two of which I'm keen to get back to now. The first one is going to be called 'Freckles' and I'm knitting the squares for it in one of my favourite stitches - fabric stitch. This produces a knitted fabric that looks almost woven..Then there's this complex crochet blanket which I'm absolutely itching to get to work on again ...There are lots more geometric shapes waiting to be sewn together for my starry table runner too ...Not that this project has been neglected lately but, when I tipped out the bowl of triangles to take this photo, a spider scuttle out too. I really must get on and sew them together.The last of my new ideas is these little knitted pyramids.At the moment I'm just knitting them in random colours and playing with them but I have plans to turn them into an actual something.I hope you've enjoyed this rather random look at what I'm thinking and planning at the moment. I've just started the fifteenth folder of my designs - I'm going to need a new shelf soon at this rate."},
{"title": "Two Great Grannies", "date": "Friday 4 October 2019", "text": "The first of the two Great Grannies is the least important - my new crochet pattern.I've thoroughly enjoyed making this blanket which has turned out very big by my standards. It's about 150 cm square; I normally get fed up making things long before they get to that size. It took me quite a long time to choose the colours and, although it may look random, there's a definite plan to their arrangement. I really don't do random.You can download the free pattern for my Great Granny blanket from  Ravelry as normal. And here's one more photo, complete with furry assistant.The 'Great' in the pattern name obviously refers to the fact that it's one big square but I was also thinking of a real life Great Granny when I was working on it. My much missed Granny (my children's Great Granny) who I spent many hours with making Granny square blankets.My Granny, Ida, was born in 1915. Her father worked on the railways, as did her two brothers and a brother-in-law. The family moved around a fair bit; I have my Great Grandmother's old postcards, dating from 1904 and the addresses all begin 'Railway Cottages' ...Here she is on her wedding day in December 1935. I think her dress is absolutely beautiful.Now my Grandad, Frank, was a builder but, more importantly (as he would probably have said), he was also a Pigeon fancier. For those who don't know anything about this world, this means he kept racing pigeons at the top of the garden. Which is why so many of the family photos have a pigeon loft as the backdrop. Here's my Mum all dressed up in front of the loft ...... and with her sister and parents in front of the loft ...I think it could do with a lick of paint in this one. That's Mum's sister Frances on the end in this photo. Sadly, she died at seventeen. When I was born four years later, I was christened Frances Mary after her.Here's a photo taken at the front of their house for a change so no pigeons to be seen.The shy one is me, with my Mum, brother, Granny and Grandad. Note the hand knitted jumpers. Those ones would have been knitted by Mum but Granny was always knitting too. Mum swore that, when her Mum, Granny and Aunt were all living a few doors apart during the war, she went to sleep with her arms held out - just in case anyone needed to wind more wool during the night!I spent a lot of time with my Granny as I grew up; she taught me how to cross stitch when I stayed with her for a week when I was about seven - big fabric and even bigger stitches but I was very proud of myself. I think my love of walking came from Granny too; we walked for miles and, in later years, started a tradition of the two of us going for a long walk (complete with ice cream) every Christmas Eve. Mostly though, I remember us sitting in the garden doing our knitting, crocheting together, sewing ... just lots of craft. You can see evidence of all this craft in lots of the photos of Granny. Here she is with my baby daughter ...The ladybird jumper was my work but Granny's cardigan, the crochet chair back and the patchwork cushions were all Granny's. You can't see the rugs on the floor but she made those too and, obviously, she could turn her hand to dressmaking too. She liked to dabble in all sorts of crafts but knitting was her real love; when arthritis in her hands made it hard for her to knit bigger things, she concentrated on socks. The pattern I still use is a variation of her original, much battered one.  One last photo. This one was taken in my back garden when we lived in Peckham. Four female generations of my family, Granny, Mum, me and my daughter.I love this photo; you can see we were all having fun (apart from the baby who has no idea what's going on).  Happy memories."},
{"title": "Sewing", "date": "Monday 30 September 2019", "text": "When I haven't been working hard on this years big series of Christmas patterns (first drafts all done - just letting them sit for the mistakes to rise to the surface), I've been doing lots of sewing. I was inspired by finding this very exciting book ...... Stitched Sewing Organizers by Annela Hoey Now Annela is a very good designer. Not only are her patterns interesting and clever, they are also very well explained with plenty of detail and helpful diagrams. So far I've made a few of these lovely little pouches.The bigger one went straight off in the post to my daughter and I forgot to take a photo but here's the little one I kept for myself.The tools with it are also new purchases. The little measuring gauge is very useful for checking seam allowances and folds when making small projects; I can guess quarter and half inches by eye but not the rest. The white thing is a point-turner-outer (not entirely sure that's it's official name but you know what I mean). After years of using knitting needles and pencils to push the corners out, this little thing has been a revelation. It's so much easier and also less likely to poke through the corners.I've also been making various sizes of Aneela's fabric boxes; here are a few square ones.She gives the measurements for two sizes of rectangular boxes in the book but, being me, I had to see if I could make stacking square boxes. Having done that, I think her boxes are actually a more useful size. The secret behind these boxes is the really heavy interfacing that she uses; I've learnt a lot about interfacing from this book and managed to find what I needed at Cotton Patch.There are lots of wonderful patterns in this book but I was excited to find that there are more to buy from Aneela's blog. There's a pencil case that unzips into a tray - Zip-Up Tray Pouch, a Booklet Pouch and lots more. Her designs are really new and refreshing and I want to make them all! Do go and have a look at what she does. Where you see individual patterns that are in the book, I think you get more sizes by buying them separately.So, what else have I been sewing? I've been trying my hand at making I Spy Bags. Have you heard of these? They're small fabric bags with a clear plastic window. You fill the bags with plastic pellets and tiny treasures - beads, buttons, whatever you can find. They're a portable, fun toy as children (or me) try to spot all the little things.I bought the materials and instructions to make one of these bags from Tactile Treasures who sell all sorts of exciting bits and bobs to add to your nursery projects - squeakers, teethers, that sort of thing. I opted for a pack without the fabric as I have mountains of that and, very importantly, I bought a small roll of the plastic so that I'd be able to make more bags.There were 20 little treasures in my pack and, considering I'd picked it at random, they were quite appropriate for me.There's a cat, music notes and even a little 'F'. Now, I had a couple of problems making my first bag. Firstly, the instructions suggest that the circle is the easiest shape to make your window but I can sew a square much more accurately so, after a wonky attempt at a circle, I made my window square. I also found that, when sewing the plastic to the fabric, you need to have the plastic on top. I tried it underneath to start with and it slid all over the place. Apart from that, it was an easy make - here's the finished bag.This would be ideal for a young child but this 58 year old found a bit too easy to see all the treasures so I changed things a bit for the next bag. This time I made the window smaller and added more plastic pellets.I'm happier with this one and shall definitely be making more of these. It's fun looking out for little things to put in these bags; you could have a theme for your treasures or, for a real challenge, how about using all white treasures so they blend in with the pellets.I've also done a bit of dressmaking and have plans (and patterns) to do more. I finally got round to making this tunic dress, having bought the pattern and fabric ages ago.I used a green cord from Royal Fabrics and Haberdashery in Leamington Spa which is a proper, old fashioned shop with lots crammed in to quite a small shop. As well as the fabric, they have yarn, buttons and a huge range of ribbon and braid. The pattern is this one from Grainline Studio; it's called the Willow Tank and Dress. This was a quick and easy make - no zips, no buttons - and I'm pleased with it. I wear this sort of dress a lot in the winter, with a cotton polo neck underneath and boots. The only thing missing is POCKETS! Don't get me started about the lack of pockets in women's clothes .... To be fair though, I realised after making it that pockets wouldn't have worked on this design. There's a big fold at about hip level which is a nice feature of the dress so patch pockets would have to be below that (and would look odd, I think). The fold also covers the side seam so you can't insert pockets there either.I think I'll adapt the pattern next time to take the fold out and then I can add in some pockets. I've bought some black drill to make another one. I know that sounds dull but I'm planning to brighten it up with some colourful appliqué or embroidery.While I was at the fabric shop, I also bought this lovely fabric to make a skirt.I'll use it with the stripes running vertically; the plain red is what I' going to use for the inset pockets.My other completed sewing project is a kit that I've had for years but had felt a bit daunted by. I told myself just to get on with it so I did and, after two long days of sewing, this is the result.This is the Vintage Flower Bag by Button Angel which I bought from Bobbin Patch. There are lots of intricate details on this bag, like the hand appliquéd and embroidered flowers and these little decorative tongues on the side pockets.The back is the same as the front so everything has to be done twice over but the finished bag is really quite stunning. I especially like the pieced lining to the strap (simple things) and I can't wait to take it to next year's Festival of Quilts - lots of room for purchases in there. It was a long two days of sewing but I learnt a lot from making this and it's given me the confidence to tackle other complex projects.Unfortunately, I can't show you the rest of the things I've been sewing as they're all intended for Christmas presents. Yes, that's right, this is the year that everyone will be getting lots of homemade tat / treasures from me. The present drawer is filling up nicely.We've had a lovely Indian summer here, sadly now replaced by rain but I made the most of it while it lasted and had some lovely walks.This was Hazelborough Woods looking beautiful in the sunshine and unusually free from mud too. I saw an interesting animal on that walk. I only saw its body and tail as it disappeared off the path ahead of me but it was too orange and fluffy to be a fox. Think Crookshanks, Hermione's cat in the Harry Potter books. Given that these woods are quite a way from the nearest village, it was either a lost domestic cat, a wild cat or some magical creature ...On a more mundane note, I've also been blackberrying; between us, my son and I managed to pick 9lb on one walk. Some of his are going to be turned into Blackberry Whisky, mine are now common or garden Blackberry and Apple Jam and Bramble Chutney. While the kitchen floor was still sticky (why does this always happen when making preserves?) and the house smelt of vinegar, I thought I might as well do the rest so I made my normal Christmas Chutney and Pickled Onions. I've been making these two for years and both recipes came from Delia Smith's Christmas book, the original one with the green cover.And now I must get back to work. I've finally finished my big Granny Square blanket so I should get that written up and published soon. It's the biggest blanket I've ever made I think."},
{"title": "Chippy Charity Shops", "date": "Friday 30 August 2019", "text": "Try saying that title in a hurry. I found some exciting things in a browse round Chippy this week and thought you might like to see them.Mostly books, as you can see (there's a surprise). The Oxfam Bookshop is particularly good and I nearly always find a treasure or two there. The very first thing I pounced on was this two volume set from Dover.It's a reprint of a Victorian Needlework Encyclopedia, first published in 1882 and it was only £5 for both books. As you'd expect, there are sections on knitting and crochet, as well as hundreds of different types of needlework. I was pleased to see some tatting had been included ...... and look at this - Log Cabin patchwork described simply as 'American Patchwork'.The best part is the supplement which takes up about half of the second volume and is full of engravings of all manner of things 'made or decorated by needlework'. There are lots of work bags and boxes ...... as well as quite a few things we don't feel the need for nowadays. Anyone fancy a watch stand?As a keen picnicker, I was rather taken with this luncheon case, decorated with navy blue dress braid.Lots to explore in these lovely books.On a more up to date note, I also found another Zakka sewing book.I believe 'zakka' means 'miscellaneous' in Japanese and the term has become used to describe small things that improve your life (I think that's right, anyway). In sewing terms, this means lots of small projects that are both pretty and useful, ideal for gifts. I love this sort of book and have already found several things I'd like to make from this one.These little purses use a small crochet doiley for the flap. Isn't that a clever idea?And you can never have too many shopping bags, especially if they come with a pattern for a little pouch to hold them ...The Oxfam shop is particularly good for children's picture books and, this time, I found one I'd never seen before.A Zeal of Zebras is an alphabet of collective nouns and has some very striking illustrations. A Down of RabbitsAn Exaltation of LarksOne last book and it's a new addition to my Jane Austen shelf (okay, shelves but who's counting?). Now I like gardening and I like Jane Austen so obviously I had to buy this one. As well as some lovely pictures of gardens she knew, it also has information about plants available in her time.I really must go to visit her house in Chawton again; it's been years since I last went. In the kitchen garden at Chawton they use strings of seashells to keep birds off the tender plants. I do like that idea.My other two finds in Chippy were this teapot and bowl which were in the same charity shop.I really like the shiny glaze on the teapot. It's made by Pillivuyt in France, a company I'd not heard of before. Now I just need to knit it its own personal tea cosy as none of my others fit it; the spout is higher than normal for a start and the lid is completely flat.The bowl is beautiful, isn't it? It's an example of Dragon Pottery from Rhyader in Wales which made china between the 1950s and 1980s.It's the first piece of Dragon Pottery I've bought. This particular design reminds me of some of the Isle of Wight studio pottery made by Jo Lester which I do collect.It's the combination of vivid colours, patterns and the quirkiness of the animals that appeals to me. There's also a touch of nostalgia about these for me as my Mum started this collection many years ago on a family holiday on the Isle of Wight in the early 1960s.These little dishes moved house with us whenever we did and they always make me smile and think of Mum."},
{"title": "Peruvian Purse", "date": "Friday 23 August 2019", "text": "I had a lovely day at the Festival of Quilts a few weeks ago. There's always so much inspiration to be had from the quilts on display; I was particularly pleased to see that there was more hand quilting on show this year. There was also a very interesting display of old Baltimore Album quilts from the 1840s and 1850s.There was a good range of interesting stalls too. I always like seeing different things and found a new to me business selling teddy bear making supplies called Amazing Craft. I must get out my half finished teddy bear and get it done. I've made a few bears over the  years and would really like to get back to it.I bought a bit of this and a bit of that ...Lots of buttons, an embroidery book, a coat pattern and some cat fabric. I had to buy the cat fabric as the grey tabby on it looks just a bit like Tolly cat.I've turned it into a reversible tote bag, using my trusty pattern. See the cat with is left paw up in the air? That's exactly how Tolly looks when he's patting at the cat flap, trying to get it to open. Now the cat flap is controlled by the cats' microchips which are in the back of their necks. This means that they have to open it with their heads. My other cat, Linnet, learnt this in about two minutes ... more than two years later and Tolly still sits there patting at it. Really not the brightest of cats.Amongst the bits and bobs I bought were a few of these intriguing purse clasps.I found these on the Craft & Cotton stall where they were also selling kits using them. Have a look at their Peruvian Purse kits. I was very taken with these little purses which change shape when they're closed. So, naturally, I bought some clasps and set about designing a knitted version.As you can see, the top is pulled together when it's closed to give it a triangular shape. It fastens with a magnetic catch to hold the contents securely. I knitted my purses in moss stitch, changing between the three colours every row to give a nice tweedy effect.If you fancy making one of these, the pattern is free from my ravelry shop. It's easy to knit; the trickiest part is assembling the clasp but I've included lots of photos to help with that.Now, what else can I find to do to avoid having to work on this year's Christmas pattern? I have actually sketched and planned it all now and I know the order the patterns are going  to be published in. Just the small matter of designing it all to go."},
{"title": "Comfort Knitting", "date": "Sunday 11 August 2019", "text": "At the moment I'm officially working on my big Christmas pattern series for this year. What I'm actually doing most of the time is playing with colours.This is a Scheepjes Colour Pack, consisting of 10g balls of each of the 36 colours of their Stone Washed yarn and the 22 River Washed. I hadn't used this yarn before and thought it would be fun to knit squares with all the colours.I decided to use the Quilted Lattice pattern that I used in my big blanket pattern last year and, after a bit of experimentation, worked out that I could knit a 5\" square from each little ball and have just enough yarn left to make a colour peg for future reference.The two yarn ranges go together well; the Stone Washed has a subtle variegation, a bit like Stylecraft Batik, while the River Washed is more of a solid colour but with a lovely bloom to the yarn. Both yarns are beautifully soft. I'm knitting the squares in order; here's the top row as it came out of the box.As well as this comfort knitting, I've got some comfort crochet on the go too. I'm working round and round on a huge Granny square, using some lovely shades of Sylecraft Special.Those colours may look random but it takes a long time to get the perfect balance of random. I'm thouroughly enjoying working on this; it gets dumped into a basket and taken with me whenever I sit outside and is now getting quite big.Mind you,  a blanket that looks big on your lap doesn't look nearly big enough when you lay it out flat on the floor so I've got a way to go yet. Making this reminds me of my Granny who taught me how to make Granny square blankets like this. I remember sitting with her, working on them together, using up odd lengths of yarns as they came to hand. Happy Memories."},
{"title": "New Books", "date": "Wednesday 31 July 2019", "text": "I always enjoy a day out in Leamington Spa and I nearly always come back with new books. This is owing to two exciting shops: Presto Music, an independent, proper music shop and The Craft Works. This, as you can probably guess, is a craft only version of the discount chain The Works.I did particularly well recently and thought you might like to see what I got. Music first, because I always go to the music shop first.I got two new violin books. The duets are to give me something a bit more 'normal' to try as I've only played Bartok duets so far which, although fun, are something of a challenge. The new book has eight duets from eighteenth century - right up my street. I also got a new book of violin studies, 'More Technique Takes Off' (to follow on from 'Technique Takes Off' naturally). I only had one more study to work on in the first book so I thought I'd be on to this new one soon ... turns out they saved up lots of hard stuff and crammed it all in the last piece - trills, vibrato, tricky timing. I may be a while.The piano book is Burgmuller's famous set of piano studies. I never did studies when I learnt the piano so didn't know about these until my violin teacher recommended them. They're lovely little pieces, easy to sight read but hard to play really well.I also got a recorder book (well, we wouldn't want the recorders to feel left out, would we?). A Baroque Anthology for descant recorders which I plan to play on my tenor recorder. Baroque is best. One day, I'm going to make myself a badge with that on. Also, one with 'Music for a while shall all your cares beguile' (from a Purcell song, in case you wondered).So, that's the new music books. Now for the craft books.All three of them have lovely covers and, I don't care what anyone says, I do like a book to have a pretty cover. Let's have a closer look at them, one by one.'Beautiful Stitches' by Susan Bates is full of simple, freestyle embroidery designs. Animals, flowers, gardens - there's something for everyone. I love old-fashioned country scenes, the sort of thing featured in my old Stitchcraft magazines so this was one of my favourites ...I was rather taken with the seed packet designs too ...I have a lot of nasturtiums in my garden but, at the moment, they're more leaf than flower.I think they're pretending to be lily pads.This one features several of my favourite things: gardens, tea (although that should be a cup and saucer, not a mug) and, of course, knitting.DMC colours are given for all the designs in the book or you could just use whatever shades you have, a bit like colouring in with thread.This next book is the one I'm most excited about.Sew Flower Quilts & Gifts by Atsuko Matsuyama is just gorgeous. What is it about Japanese quilting books that makes them so stylish? The designs are always appealing and full of the most perfect details. It is possible to use Japanese quilting books even if you don't read Japanese as they normally include diagrams and measurements but this one is in English.What shall I show you? How about this picnic lunch set and beautiful little bag? Just look at those flowers ... and the lace edging .. and the patchwork strap ...There are four little seasonal wall hangings too; here are the ones for autumn and winter...I love all the little details in this sewing kit ...You can never have too many sewing kits, especially if they're as pretty as this one.Most of the projects in the book are small but there is one big sampler quilt. I just love the fabrics this designer uses - lots of bright pastels, typical of the 1930s. This is one of those books where I could happily make every single project.The last of the craft books is a bit different as it's all about making flowers out of fabric.At first I thought the cover was the best part of Fabric Blooms by Megan Hunt but then I found her felt flowers.Felt, bright colours, buttons? Some of my favourite things. How about this for a fantastic bouquet - the bridesmaids would be fighting each other to catch this one.You could use these flowers as a starting point for your own designs; they'd make lovely decorations for cards too. Now I would never wear this sort of thing (because, frankly, I'd look ridiculous in it) but aren't these felt flowers beautiful?I don't know when I'll find time to make something from one of these new craft books but who cares? In the meantime, I can enjoy browsing through them; craft books are some of the best comfort reads I know."},
{"title": "People's Park", "date": "Saturday 27 July 2019", "text": "It's taken me a while but I've finally managed to collect together some photos (and summon up the energy) to tell you about our party in the park.When I first moved to Banbury twenty years or so ago, I thought the park at the end of my road must be quite a new one with its modern sounding name. In fact, the park - and its name - have been around for a very long time. It all started with a man called George Ball who owned a chemist's shop in Banbury in the late nineteenth century. When he died in 1892 he left £3,200 in his will to be used for ... '... a Park for the recreation of all classes during every day of the week from sunrise to sunset all the year round, to be ornamentally laid out, and called the People's Park.'It took some time to come about but the park finally came into being just before the First World War. At that time the land was rented from a private syndicate; when it became the property of the Council  after the war, it was felt to be truly a People's Park at last. Which is where we get to the original opening ceremony in July 1919. In the pouring rain, the people of Banbury came out to watch a Fine Lady on a white horse process through the town to the park. It was a combination of celebration and commemoration; the horse had been to the war and back and wore his owner's medals on his bridle. To those watching on it must have been a poignant sight.from the Banbury AdvertiserAbout a year ago, this old photograph was the starting point for a group of local residents who set out to help plan a party to celebrate the park's centenary. The Town Council are the experts at planning these sort of events; what we offered was raw enthusiasm, creative ideas ... and a lot of knitting.One of my neighbours was in charge of assembling a huge amount of bunting made by local groups and schools, another put together a costume for our Fine Lady out of charity shop finds and Jane worked tirelessly all year to find local groups and encourage them to be part of the event. And me? I was responsible for the yarn bombing.I wrote patterns for simple knitted and crocheted squares, advertised for volunteers ... and then got completely swamped by hundreds and hundreds of squares! In the end we used 1,000 squares in the park on the day, made up into 28 blankets and other decorations, but I've still got masses of squares left over.We wrapped blankets round trees ...... and pillars ...This is the entrance from my road... and we used them on benches and the ground too ...The picture above was taken in the Rose Garden which looked particularly beautiful with all its blankets, bunting and deckchairs.Local primary schools plant and decorate flowerbeds each year and these added to the gaiety of this special part of the park.I thought these flags, from many countries, looked fantastic tied round the tennis courts too.The bunting and loose blankets came down at the end of the day but I left the ten tree blankets up for another couple of weeks, during which there were two more events in the park. Every time I went to do running repairs, as well as when we put the blankets up and took them down, lots and lots of people stopped to say how much they loved them. I hadn't expected them to be so popular but they really were. When Jane and I finally took them down yesterday, people were sad to see them go.So, what do you do with dozens of very large, quite dirty blankets? Well at the moment they're all piled up on my bedroom floor while I try to ignore them.I'm going to wash them, find somewhere to store them and then ... we'll put it all up again next year. It was so popular it seems a shame not to use them in the park for future events. A local church has also expressed an interest in using them to yarn bomb their wonderful church so that would be exciting.Then there are all those unused squares ... I'm thinking of turning them into some sort of woolly bunting. It would be longer lasting than the paper sort. So, that was the all-important yarn bombing but there was also the small matter of the party itself. Right from the start we knew we wanted a procession like that of 1919 and, if at all possible, we wanted a Fine Lady on a white horse too. Which is where Michelle and Foggy came in. Michelle is a very experienced rider and Foggy coped beautifully with all the noise and people in the procession - not to mention the brass band. And didn't they look the part?This is them leading the procession round the Cross ...'Ride a cock horse to Banbury Cross, to see a Fine Lady upon a white horse'and yes, she had rings on her fingers and bells, if not on her toes, on her ankles. Even Foggy wore flowers for the occasion.Here they are, with Sir Tony Baldry, the High Steward of Banbury and Surinder Dhesi, the Deputy Town Mayor.These last two photos were taken by Puritans Radio, a local radio station who act as Master of Ceremonies for this and many other local events.The day itself was like a great big village fete. There were stalls all over the park, representing local groups and businesses as well as charities. There was a dog show, crazy golf ( which looked fantastic, this would be a great permanent addition to the park), Punch & Judy, circus skills, face painting, go karts ... Local groups performed in the arena, ice creams were eaten and everybody had a lot of fun.I spent the entire day running between the Labour Party stall - where we shared bubbles, chat and made friendship bracelets - and the History stall and, in between that, my daughter and I gave out hundreds of commemorative badges (which I made) to every child we could find! Jane had prepared a lovely display of old photographs of the park which attracted a lot interest throughout the day and we'd also put together a History Trail and a Memory Hedge. I didn't get any photos of the History Trail but here are some of people's memories of the park, hanging on the hedge.It was all an awful lot of hard work but oh, so worth it. To see the Fine Lady appear at the entrance to the park reduced me to tears - suddenly, it was all really happening. It was a very happy day, bursting to the seams with a real old-fashioned sense of community that I hope the people of 1919 would have recognised. Here's a bit of a taster of the day, courtesy of the Town Council ...Should you want to read more about the park's history, I stole the few facts I used here from Jane's two excellent blog posts on Municipal Dreams. I do urge you to take a look at these, they're full of interesting details and there are some great old photographs too."},
{"title": "Blankets, blankets, blankets ...", "date": "Wednesday 10 July 2019", "text": "There's no getting round it, my house is full of blankets. There are only a few days to go to the People's Park Centenary and the yarn bombing is everywhere. There are blankets for trees ...... and blankets for benches.At the moment I'm blocking a blanket a day which takes up lots of space on my bedroom floor. The cats are helping by sleeping on the wet blankets. Why do they always do that?As well as the yarn bombing, I'm involved with planning various other activities for the day. This is just one of several collections of necessary stuff to be found wherever I can find space for them.This lot (next to the microwave) is for the History Trail and the Labour Party stall. We're going to be making friendship bracelets with children and adults - that's the floppy things in the jug - and a mini bunting display of people's hopes for the future; the bunting flags are in the yellow bucket. As you can see, I've been doing a lot of cutting out lately.There's also a pile of bubble blowing solution on the floor and the Labour Party banner is in the hall. I suppose I really need to work out how to put that together before Sunday. I have a constant 'to do' list on the go at the moment and, fast as I cross things off it, I think of more things to add to it. We've been helping to plan this event for a year now and, fingers and paws crossed, it's going to be a good one.Today I thought I would have what I laughingly call a 'day off', by which I mean a day when I do my normal work. So, what did I do? I worked on another crochet blanket.This is my Happy blanket, made with more of the lovely Sirdar Happy Cotton that you may remember me talking about recently. It took me all yesterday evening to work out how to arrange the squares; today I've been crocheting them together and taking lots of pictures. I really enjoyed it, it felt like a holiday to be doing my own work again.I need to buy more of the cream yarn now before I can do the edging. When it only comes in 20g balls, that means buying lots of them. I looked at substituting another yarn for the cream for this reason but I couldn't find anything as nice and it didn't seem to work out cheaper anyway.I've got a couple of year long blanket projects on the go this year too. I've just passed the halfway mark with my woven temperature blanket. Every day I weave a triangle in a colour that represents the maximum temperature on that day. Broadly speaking, it goes from blue at the coldest, via purple and green to orange and red for hot days.Can you see the triangle for the last but one day of June? It's red! The first red day of the year (and only one so far). I got very excited about that. The blanket is a bit on the lumpy, bumpy side and my embroidery is definitely wonky but who cares? I'm hoping that blocking will work wonders for it but I can't really do that until it's finished.The other ongoing blanket is my Year in Yarn. This is where I work a patchwork block for each month, made up of patches representing everything I've worked on. The months are put together in the following month so I've only got five months of this to show.Far fewer projects in April and May than in the first three months of the year - park preparations again. I expect the next few months' blocks will be a lot busier.Right - I can now cross 'Write blog post' off my list. what's next?"},
{"title": "Charity Down", "date": "Tuesday 2 July 2019", "text": "I have an old box in my house that once contained fireworks. They cost 20/- which means they were bought before 1971 - and there's a remarkably cheery picture of Guy Fawkes on the lid.This is the box that Mum kept the old family photographs in, most of them in black and white and many of them very small indeed.My daughter has a very grown up, professional scanner and she's recently scanned all these photos so that we can see them in greater detail. It's amazing what a difference it makes. Tiny photos that don't look that exciting turn out to be real treasures when you can see them properly.Which brings me to Charity Down ...Not even big enough to be a hamlet, Charity Down consisted of the farm buildings and two small cottages, set in a valley at the end of a long road. We lived in the cottage on the left from when I was a baby until I was about three. Here I am, sitting on the back step in my nightie.I don't remember Charity but I have heard lots of stories about our time there, mostly because we lived there during the winter of 1962 - 3. That was one of the coldest winters on record in England, rivers froze and many villagers were snowed in ... including us.For me and my brother it must have been quite exciting; I don't remember it at all but just look at this lovely photo of the two of us.I love the way I'm trying to copy him but, somehow, not quite getting it right. It must have been a difficult time for our parents though, no central heating then remember and only what supplies could be brought across the fields.For the rest of her life, wherever she lived, Mum always made sure her cupboards were stocked up in winter \"in case we get snowed in\". I remember finding it very funny that she told me to do the same when I was living in Birmingham but, looking at these pictures, it makes sense.We never were snowed in again as badly as this but I always half expect it to happen and yes, I stock up in winter too."},
{"title": "Ironbridge", "date": "Sunday 30 June 2019", "text": "A few weeks ago my son and I had a day out in this wonderful little town.This is Ironbridge on the banks of the River Severn in Shropshire. It's known as the birthplace of the Industrial Revolution so I was expecting something a little more  - well, industrial. Had I visited in the second half of the eighteenth century It would all have looked very different.'Coalbrrokdale by Night' by Philip de Loutherbourrg (1740 - 1812)Abraham Darby developed the use of coke, rather than charcoal in the manufacture of cast iron early in the eighteenth century, producing a high quality product at low cost.  The original smelting works led to factories producing ceramic tiles and china, all within a few miles of each other in what was then known as Coalbrookdale.Some fifty years later, Darby's grandson (also called Abraham) decided that a bridge was needed to link the town with the industrial works on the south bank of the river. The result was the first bridge to be built entirely of cast iron anywhere in the world.'Ironbridge inder Construction' by Elias Martin (1739 - 1818)During recent conservation work, parts of the original paintwork were exposed and the whole bridge has now been re-painted in this colour.Doesn't it look magnificent? I love all those repeated lines and patterns. From the start, the bridge was something of a tourist attraction and anyone and everyone had to pay a toll.As you can see, you even had to pay a halfpenny (pronounced haypenny for my younger readers) to take a lamb across the bridge.  There were no exceptions at the other end of the social scale either.'This bridge being private property, every Officer or Soldier whether on duty or not, is liable to pay toll for passing over, as well as any baggage waggon, Mail-coach or the Royal Family.'Within the six miles of the Gorge, there are lots of exciting museums to visit. There's one about Coalport China, a tile museum, a clay pipe museum ... you can visit the Darby houses and, as if that wasn't enough, there's a re-creation of a Victorian town at Blists Hill. I do love a good museum so this is very much my sort of place.By now you've probably guessed that we had been lured to Ironbridge by all this glorious history ... well, if so, you'd be wrong. What we actually drove two and a half hours for - beautiful country all the way - was this ...Yes, it's a book shop (of course it is). This is not just any old secondhand bookshop though, this is Twice Told Tales which specialises in Penguin and Puffin books. We both collect first editions of the Puffin storybooks, old green Penguin crime books and Picture Puffins.This is just part of my collection - green penguins at the top and puffins below. The picture books at the end of the middle shelf are my Picture Puffins. These were wonderful books, full of information and with beautiful artwork.At the bottom right corner is my checklist of Puffin Picture books which I bought from the Penguin Collectors Society and which has helped me list my collection correctly. Both the text and the illustrations often changed between editions (and yes, it does matter).We spent hours in this little bookshop, sorting through all the treasures and couldn't have been made more welcome. It's a wonderful shop and we'll definitely be going back. Now that we know what a beautiful place Ironbridge is, I think a holiday is called for. I'd love to visit all the museums and it looks a great place for walking too.Anyway, want to see what I bought? I had to restrain myself as there were so many books I'd never even seen before so I concentrated on the more unusual ones.These two books are from a short series I'd never heard of before, published in the 1940s and 50s. I do love books on design.There were some beautiful Penguin books on music; I managed to restrict myself to these two.There was also a book of madrigals and another one of part songs ... choices, choices. I did get a few Picture Puffins too, including a rare one ('The Story of Louisa').If you collect Penguin or Puffin books, a visit to Ironbridge is an absolute must.Downstairs is more 'normal' stock and this looked good too - we definitely need to go back here.After lunch sitting outside a friendly cafe near the bookshop (Ironbridge seems to be a very friendly place), we had a walk along the river and went to one of the smaller museums. It's such a beautiful place, just look at this wild flower meadow on the banks of the river.And I really liked the buildings too - isn't that brickwork great?All in all, Ironbridge was a revelation to us - we'll definitely be going back."},
{"title": "Works in Progress", "date": "Tuesday 18 June 2019", "text": "This is where I try to turn the muddled collection of projects that I'm currently flitting between into something that looks planned and orderly.I nearly always (who am I kidding? - always) have several blanket projects on the go but, lately, blankets have started to take over the house.Now I didn't make these but I have been responsible for crocheting some of them together. They are going to be decorating my local park next month as we celebrate its 100th birthday.This is one of the trees being fitted for its blanket. There are going to be ten trees decorated like this as well as half a dozen park benches covered with blankets and more used as picnic blankets on the grass.We've had hundreds and hundreds of knitted and crocheted squares donated by volunteers; every time I go into the wool shop I come home with bags full of them. Finding people to crochet the squares together has been more of a challenge but we're getting there.This is my favourite blanket, crocheted together by the brilliant Karen who also made all the crochet squares. This one is going in pride of place on the bench by the War Memorial in the middle of the park.Here's one I made ...This is one of a pair of long, thin blankets that I'm going to wrap round the top of the stone pillars at one of the park entrances. Just in case you're wondering, it takes quite a long time to crochet 96 flowers and even longer to sew them on. My friend Pat (who's doing sterling work on crocheting squares together) is making another pair of pillar blankets which will be decorated with pompoms.The big day is Sunday, 14th July and there's still lots of crochet to do but I am not going to panic. It will get done. If anyone local is reading this, do come along to People's Park In Banbury on the day. It's going to be like a huge village fete with lots of fun for everyone. The day will start with a huge procession from the town centre to the park, via the Cross. It will be led by a Fine Lady (on a white horse, of course)* and will be full of groups big and small from across the community.The original procession in 1919 was led by a white horse who had served in the war, complete with campaign medals on his bridle which must have been very moving. Sadly, it poured with rain on that day; keep your fingers crossed that it doesn't do that for us. We've had lots of rain lately, quite a lot of it torrential so let's hope it's getting it out of its system.In between organising this yarn bombing, I have been working on other stuff too. What shall I show you first? Some pretty crochet?I'm still in love with the new Sirdar Happy Cotton that I showed you the other week. After my 'how much can I make with ten 20g balls?' obsession, I'm now using twelve colours - plus cream - to make ... a blanket (of course I am). After crocheting a few squares I thought they looked a bit plain so I've added a little bit of running stitch across the diagonals to liven them up. This is a beautiful yarn to work with; I'm not normally a big fan of cotton but this one is lovely and soft to use.More crochet but this time a shawl (very daring). This is a sparkly sock yarn and I'm using linen stitch which I absolutely love. It's a bit like moss / seed stitch in knitting which is one of my favourites. You can see it a bit better in a close-up.I was originally going to make this shawl in Stylecraft Batik Elements but, after buying the yarn, I decided it wasn't right for this project. What to do with it? Turn it into a blanket of course.I'm going to combine it with three shades of Stylecraft Batik, only one of which I had in stock so yet another order is now on its way. Please tell me this happens to you too.The other project that I keep picking up involves lots of little triangles.Each triangle starts with 60 stitches and you decrease rapidly on every round so they're quickly finished. The yarn is Schoppel Wolle's Edition 3 and I'm enjoying seeing the colours flow as I knit. Sewing the triangles together isn't quite so much fun though. I think this is going to be some sort of table runner, which is what I call this sort of project when it's not big enough to qualify as a blanket. There are going to be seven bright coloured stars, surrounded and joined by the green triangles.I wouldn't like you to think that these are the only projects I've got outstanding. There are lots more; these are just the ones I'm actually working on at the moment. What about you? Are you working on something fun? A nice blanket perhaps?* For my non UK readers, my town's claim to fame (along with Banbury Cakes) is its very own nursery rhyme:'Ride a Cock Horse to Banbury Cross,To see a fine lady upon a white horse.                 With rings on her fingers and bells on her toes,        She shall have music wherever she goes.'So now you know."},
{"title": "A Country Walk", "date": "Thursday 23 May 2019", "text": "One of the joys of having my son living near me now is being able to go for walks together. He works as a supply teacher so often doesn't know if he'll be working until the morning of any day. This means our walks are often spur of the moment which is actually quite nice.On a sunny day last week we had a walk out into the local countryside that was full of bright colours. We started off on the old Mineral Way footpath in Banbury and then headed across the fields to Drayton. Just as we were coming into the village we saw this beautiful ceanothus; I don't think I've ever seen one with such a vivid colour before.I really must plant one of these in my garden as they obviously thrive in our clay soil.We ere following the road through Drayton, heading for the next footpath when we looked over the side of a bridge and saw the most beautiful, tempting path ...... winding up and down through the trees, it ran between two small streams - just the sort of place where you might come across a hobbit or two. This sort of footpath can't be ignored so we followed it to the end.Luckily, it wasn't a long path and took us to a field from which we could see the path we had been looking for.As you can see, the oilseed rape fields are out in flower at the moment. The flowers look beautiful and smell of honey but they make me wheeze terribly so I find them a bit of a mixed blessing. Just look at the colour though ...This picture was taken from eye height - the flowers came up past my shouldersWe emerged from the yellow fields into Wroxton village, where I took the opportunity to get a few photos of a rather unusual little church.Yes, that's right, it's a thatched church. This is the Catholic church of St Thomas and can you see who's standing just inside the wall?I always like to see Mary as I drive through the village so it was nice to be able to get a closer look.From Wroxton we walked across the fields to North Newington - more bright yellow, this time buttercups.Just before Newington, we turned off through more rape fields until we came to this little wood which were looking particularly lovely in the sunshine.I saw a buzzard in this wood a couple of weeks ago; they have a very distinctive call, a bit like a kitten mewing.By the time we got back to town we were in need of an ice cream and, in my case, a very big cup of tea. I do like walking though - fresh air, beautiful countryside and exercise. what's not to like?"},
{"title": "Happy Crochet", "date": "Friday 10 May 2019", "text": "Last week I discovered this exciting new yarn in my local shop.It's from Sirdar and goes by the wonderful name of Happy Cotton. Those little balls are only 20g and cost £1 each. There are fifty colours to choose from and I had £10 in my purse so I bought ten to play with. Each of the colours has a name as well as a number and they're great too.From left to right and top to bottom my colours are: Cherryade, Ketchup, Freckle, Melon, Wigwam, Treetop, Bunting, Princess, Currant Bun and Giggle. Aren't they evocative names? To me they conjure up memories of summer picnics and long days in the garden.Anyway, to business. My first thought was to crochet a colourful mandala so I spent a day or so playing with ideas until I came up with this ...I was so pleased with how the colours looked together and the yarn itself was a joy to work with. It's a lightish DK weight (43 m / 20g), soft and with a nice matt finish.I then thought I'd crochet another one but, this time, reversing the colours.Another lovely mandala but look how much yarn I had left. Now I could just have made more mandalas but I thought it might be nice to try something else. So, I set about designing a set of four coasters.Then I thought \"how about a little bowl to keep the coasters in?\". Lots of double crochet and a bit of shaping later and that was done too.By this point I had gone from idly wondering how far these ten little balls would go to a compulsive desire to make as many things as I could before running out of yarn. One more project should do it I thought.This little octopus was very quick to make. I used the colours I had least of for his legs and then added a simple head. But guess what? I still had yarn left, admittedly in fewer colours. Well, I couldn't stop there, could I?One little crochet pot (it's about 2\" wide and tall) - actually I made two of these, although the second one had fewer colours as I really was running out of yarn at last. The leftovers just fitted into this pot as you can see. Here's what I had left after all four projects ...I'm thinking of writing up some of these as patterns but I don't know whether to do them all or just a couple. What do you think? In the meantime, I'm off to buy some more of this beautiful yarn."},
{"title": "Look and Learn", "date": "Thursday 9 May 2019", "text": "Does anyone remember this?Look and Learn was an educational children's magazine, published weekly for twenty years from 1962. Bigger and brighter than most comics of the time, it was an immediate success with its combination of history and high quality art work.Now, I never got Look and Learn myself; I think it was seen as something for boys (along with Lego and staying up to watch the moon landing - anyone who was a girl in the 1960s will know what I mean). But I know someone who did read it ...That's me and my brother Stephen on Christmas Day 1965. I look like I've definitely had 'too much Christmas' as my Mum used to say when the excitement was all too much for us but Stephen is eagerly reading his new Look and Learn annual.Anyway, back to the present and, while visiting my daughter in London a few weeks ago, I found a big book called The Bumper Book of Look and Learn for a couple of pounds in a charity shop. I then made my daughter carry it all the way back to her flat but that's another story.One of the regulars in Look and Learn was the double page spread about historic houses. This one is about Fountains Abbey in Yorkshire.I remember us going to visit Nelson's flagship HMS Victory in Portsmouth in the 1960s. Maybe we were inspired by this feature ...Although, actually, I think Stephen may have had a Jackdaw about the Battle of Trafalgar too. They were another wonderful publication. Each Jackdaw was a folder containing facsimiles of documents relating to a particular subject. I remember being fascinated by the death warrant in the one on the trial and execution of Charles I (what a lovely child I was). Look and Learn had longer articles too. I enjoyed this one about the restricted lives of girls in Victorian times which I thought made a change from all the stories about famous men.The combination of good art and facts is irresistible and is seen in both sets of endpapers. At the front there are labelled pictures of four houses from different periods.I'm not sure that 'bright and modern house' was particularly typical of the second half of the twentieth century - most of the walls are glass - but the other three houses are interesting.The endpapers at the back of the book are about Christmas and its traditions; I particularly like the art work here.I'm sure some of my love for history came from this sort of magazine. I was given an annual of June and School Friend one Christmas which made a big impression on me. I think I've just found a replacement copy online which I'm off to buy now. If it's the one I remember, I'll report back."},
{"title": "The Tenth Ten Stitch", "date": "Wednesday 1 May 2019", "text": "I've been very busy lately. What with my bedroom being full of knitted and crocheted squares (I'm organising yarn bombing for my local park's 100th birthday) and working on this year's big Christmas pattern (started well but now I'm stuck), it's taken me ages to get this finally finished. But here it is at last - my new Ten Stitch pattern.Obviously it's called Ten Stitch Star and it's available as a free download from my Ravelry pageI designed my first Ten Stitch pattern, a square blanket, over ten years ago and it was its popularity that led me to join ravelry and think perhaps I ought to do more of this designing malarky. Since then, there have been lots of Ten Stitch variations, mostly blankets ...Ten Stitch Blanket, Ten Stitch Twist,Ten Stitch Corner and Ten Stitch CableThere were a few others though. There was an early (and quite complicated) pattern for a scarf and a wide, curved wrap...Ten Stitch Scarf and Ten Stitch WrapThis scarf is a better pattern ...Ten Stitch WaveI have to say, my photography skills have got a bit better since then. This one was cleverly posed to hide the tatty old shed at the end of the garden - long since replaced ...Ten Stitch Triangle... it was very handy having a model living at home. Now I have to make do with the cats and they're not nearly so co-operative, or co-operative at all really.I've just found another blanket so that makes nine Ten Stitch patterns before this one.Ten Stitch ZigzagThe thing all these patterns have in common is that they're knitted in one continuous strip, starting from the middle and working in spirals - although they're not necessarily round - or starting at one side and working back and forth. Having used a square, a circle and a triangle, I could think of lots of other shapes to try but the difficulty was how to start them off.I did experiment with working lots of strips at once, using stitch holders to hold the ones I wasn't actually knitting but I didn't really like it.This is as far as I got before giving up on it; I may have another go at this one day, I think I could refine it now.Anyway, back to the new and tenth Ten Stitch pattern. Ten Ten Stitches - how pleasing is that? Maybe I should stop at ten? So, the big breakthrough came when it dawned on me that, instead of working in one continuous strip, I could knit a central shape and then work separate, coloured strips around it. Of course I have to be able to knit the shapes and then work out how to angle the strips but I think this idea has a lot of possibilities. I'd been wanting to do a star blanket for a while so I spent mainly fruitless hours trying to knit a garter stitch star before realising that I had already done it.These are my Advent Stars, published a few years ago and oh look, they're garter stitch stars. It really would help if I could remember all my patterns at all times.So, I knitted a star and then started working strips round it. See those stitch markers? They're marking the middle of each side, where the stitch pattern changes.Now normally I'm a little bit fussy about my colour choices ... well, all right, I'm downright obsessive. All the colours are carefully chosen and planned out in advance, no making it up as I go along for me. This time I decided to be brave and choose each new colour as I got to the end of a round. I can't say I felt comfortable with this but decided it would be Good For Me.As you can see, I did end up using two shades of each colour - well, I had to impose some sort of control, didn't I? - but, for me, this is positively random. The blues in the middle and on the edge are actually different, maybe my photography's not so good after all. I ended up doing twelve strips, by which time one strip was using over 100g of yarn. It doesn't look like it would, does it?You could, of course, plan your colours. Shades of one colour, going from dark to light (or vice versa) would look good and, if you want to use up lots of scraps, how about alternating a scrappy round with a solid colour? I look forward to seeing what people do with this pattern.I have to say that, of all my Ten Stitch patterns, this is the one I've enjoyed knitting the most. It was a perfect balance of simple but not too boring. I think changing direction in the middle of the sides helped; what with that and the sharp corners, there was just enough variation to keep it interesting. I could have carried on and made it even bigger but suddenly realised I wouldn't be able to fit it in a picture if it grew much more.As it was, I had to balance at the top of a big ladder to take the photos (please note my weed free patio, it won't stay like that for long). Strange things happen when you take a picture with one of the points nearest to you ...... is it just me or does that point look like it's dropping off a flat surface?I had a lot of fun folding it into pleasing geometrical shapes ...It's not the most practical shape for a blanket but I think it would make a great play mat for a baby or a throw to go over a bed during the day.So, that one took me nearly a year to make. Any suggestions for Ten Stitch number eleven?"},
{"title": "Tiny Houses", "date": "Friday 5 April 2019", "text": "When I say tiny, I mean about 20 cm or 8\" wide - yes I'm talking about doll's houses. But not your normal doll's houses which are 1:12 scale, with one inch representing twelve inches in the real world. These little treasures are 1:48 - much smaller.Hedgerow Cottage from Petite PropertiesI only recently discovered the world of tiny doll's houses and went to the Miniatura show at the NEC last weekend to find out more. It was quite a small show (well, everything is ... small) but absolutely jam-packed with amazing miniatures. There was furniture, china, paintings, dolls - everything you need to fill a doll's house and much of it handmade with an incredible attention to detail.How about some toys for your doll's house nursery? A Noah's Ark or a toy farm perhaps?Toys by Jacqueline CrosbyOr what about some books for the library? These are complete editions of real books (although human people will need a magnifying glass to read them).Dateman BooksThere were several stalls selling tiny packaging representing every household product you can imagine. These little things were so small you had to pick them up with tweezers.But what I really wanted to see were the 1:48 houses and I wasn't disappointed. Herdwick Landscapes had houses inspired by the work of Beatrix Potter.Can you see Tom Kitten by the door?I was very tempted by this kit for a log cabin from Seaside Miniatures.Wouldn't this make a lovely Little House on the Prairie?The same stall also had kits for beach huts.I was really impressed by the kits and miniatures made by Jane Harrop. It was hard to take photos of her stand as it was permanently crowded but do go and have a look at her website. She even has a 1:48 kit for a Camping Coach. I think I might have to practise a bit before I'm up to making that. I did manage to get a snap of this lovely greenhouse on the end of her stand.Before I talk about my absolutely favourite stand at the show, I must show you some of the scenes being displayed by a Doll's House group from Rugby with the wonderful name of 'Small Scale Fiddlers'. They set themselves a challenge each year and, this year, it was to create a scene inspired by a book. Here are just a few of them ...Wind in the WillowsThe Lighthouse Keeper's LunchThe Lion, the Witch and the WardrobeAren't they good? It made me wonder which book I would have chosen - perhaps Lucy Boston's The Children of Green Knowe - a model of Tolly's room, complete with rocking house would be lovely.I can't wait any longer before showing you where I spent most time on the day - my absolute favourite of all the stalls ... Petite Properties.What is so lovely about these is that they are finished in all different ways to represent traditional building styles from around the country. There are brick houses, stone cottages, ones with thatch and others with tiles and they're all beautiful. You can also buy bases to fit the cottages so that you can add a garden and perhaps some little outbuildings.This is The Little Duck House with its base, complete with a sun house and, of course, a pond. You could add a greenhouse to the Gardener's Cottage or a playground to the School.Any of these would make a lovely ornament but these houses are also doll's houses. The fronts and roofs come off to reveal rooms just waiting to be filled with tiny furniture - they have kits for that too. I was particularly taken with this set of shop kits, called Cobblestone Snicket.Wouldn't these make a perfect Diagon Alley? I'd love to turn the one with the bow fronted windows into 'Weasley's Wizard Wheezes'. So ... what did I buy from this wonderful stand? I finally settled on a kit to make this little house ...Parsnip Cottage has five rooms over two floors, including a lean-to scullery and a cupboard staircase. Just look at all the little pieces in the kit.I also bought kits for the internal doors, fireplaces and cooker.I think I'm going to need some fine tweezers when I put these together ...That's a £1 coin to give you some idea of size.I also got these two really exciting books, written by Bea Broadwood.The one on the exterior finishes for the houses is brilliant. Bea explains how to create any style of house, with step by step instructions for creating bricks, stone, thatch - most of them surprisingly simple. The things you need are cheap and easy to find. You can make a tin roof from corrugated card or tiles from a combination of spaghetti, tin foil and sand! I think I'm going to try a brick finish for my cottage (cheap filler, paint and eye shadow), although I shall practise on some card first.I had a lovely day at Miniatura; I think it was the friendliest show I've been to. The next one is in the autumn so, if I can make my cottage by then, I might go back for more."},
{"title": "February in Yarn", "date": "Tuesday 2 April 2019", "text": "I finished the second block in my Year in Yarn project, just before the start of a new month. February's square was really uneven before blocking and still looks a bit wavy but I'm sure it'll be fine once I've added more blocks.I only worked on six projects in February which isn't many for me ... but I did finish a couple of things. Keeping track of what I'm making like this is definitely helping me get on with things that might otherwise be forgotten.So, starting from the top left, that navy blue and red rectangle represents yet another new crochet blanket. I'm working swirly textured circles in lots of colours and then turning them into squares with the navy edging. The centres look like they're raised in this picture but they're not; the squares lie flat. I thought I'd use lots and lots of shades of Stylecraft Special DK for this one to make it a charm blanket (charm quilts have lots of fabrics, each used only once).The big knitted grey square with the red and blue stripes is for my Pocket Boxes which I finished in February. These are little pop-up boxes, just right for holding stitch markers or other tiny things.I do like making this sort of thing - fun, small and pretty colours.The next rectangle - the yellow and cream one - is for a project that got started and stalled in the same month. I had the idea of working a brioche stitch in two colours on double pointed needles, inspired by Nancy Marchant's book Knitting Brioche. Well, I worked out a stitch I liked and it sort of worked but I'm not really happy with it. I think I need to leave this one for a bit and let it re-think itself - and yes, that does happen.The big cream square at the bottom represents my finished Secret Garden blanket which I'm really pleased with. This one took me a year to knit and is quite detailed but I loved knitting it from start to finish.I've been surprised at how popular this has been on ravelry; it's normally my simple designs that catch peoples' eye. It'll be interesting to see if anyone actually knits it.What's next? Ah yes, two more blankets (there's a surprise). The crochet one with several colours is for my Mini Marshmallow blanket which finally got going again in February. The blue triangle is part of my latest Ten Stitch design. I'm not telling you what this is as I want it to be a surprise when I publish it but it's getting pretty big now. I think it will look better for being really big so I'm carrying on with it for a bit longer but it shouldn't be too long now.And that's what I was working on in February. I've just finished the list of projects I worked on in March and there are more than twice as many - lots of them crochet - so the next block will look completely different.And here's the first of the scrapbook pages to go with February's block.Note the censored Ten Stitch title."},
{"title": "Chatelaine", "date": "Thursday 28 March 2019", "text": "Last week I had a sudden urge to knit a Chatelaine - and yes, that's perfectly normal. I'd been having fun adding beads and charms to my new stitch-picker-uppers and I think that's what put the idea in my head.I also made myself some music earrings while I was at it.A Chatelaine was originally the woman in charge of a household but, over time, the word also became used for the series of chains and links she wore to keep necessary items to hand. In a time when women's clothes didn't have pockets the chatelaine was an essential accessory. Keys and tools would be clipped on to the chatelaine which was then attached to a belt.This one, from the Victoria & Albert Museum, dates from the mid nineteenth century and has twelve different attachments, all beautifully worked in steel. As you can see, chatelaines quickly became very decorative - almost like jewellery.Towards the end of the twentieth century chatelaines again became fashionable but this time worn round the neck and invariably used to hold sewing tools. You can find patterns for all sorts of wonderful ones, ranging from simple straps to elaborately decorated creations.Simple Chatelaine Pattern from ModaElizabethan Chatelaine from Australian Needle ArtsChatelaine by Bonnie Sullivan from All Through the NightSo, back to my idea. I wanted to knit a bright, modern version of a chatelaine to hold knitting or crochet tools. A trip to my local Hobbycraft was called for, where I had a lovely time finding little bits and pieces.I was especially pleased to find the Yarn Cutter (that's the round thing at the bottom of the picture) as I thought that would be better than hanging scissors from the chatelaine. The lovely colours of the stitch markers from Pony inspired me to search for yarn to match and look what I found.James C Brett Party Time ChunkyThe knitting was super easy and quick to do. I used fabric stitch which gives a lovely thick strap and edged it with a chain selvedge.The two sides of fabric stitch - bumpy and smooth.It always takes me a couple of attempts to remember how to do a chain selvedge - slip the first stitch of every row purlwise with the yarn held at the front and knit the last stitch.Deciding how to attach the tools probably took as long as the knitting. I played around with the idea of pockets or little strips of knitting to clip things to but, in the end, decided on sewing jump rings to the  chatelaine and then clipping the tools to them.I added jump rings and swivel clips to each of the tools so that they can be taken on and off the chatelaine as needed. As you can see, I had to thread the row counter on to a short length of chain before adding the jump ring. The stitch markers are held on the sort of large ring used for keyrings.This is how they look when clipped on to the chatelaine.I also added two little knitted patches to the other side of the ends to hold sewing up needles and safety pins.And there you have it, a quick and easy pattern. Should you want to knit one of these, the free pattern is available from my Ravelry Shop. The chatelaine uses less than half the ball of yarn so you could make one for yourself and another for a friend."},
{"title": "Mini Marshmallows", "date": "Monday 18 March 2019", "text": "No, not sweets - these marshmallows are the name of a crochet stitch that gives the most wonderful chunky texture.According to my pattern notebook, I started this blanket last June. I worked on it for a while and then it got abandoned for a bit. One of the good things about recording my yarn projects in My Year in Yarn is that it reminds me of old things and nudges me to get on with them. When I fished this one out in January it wasn't much more than a wide strip of crochet and I'd run out of yarn. A quick order to the Wool Warehouse and I was back on track.I've been working on it steadily ever since and here it is (with a friend).It's difficult to show in pictures just how amazing these little marshmallows are. Here they are looked at from above ...The wrong side looks good too. Does this remind anyone else of pasta?The yarn is Patons Diploma Gold DK in seven rainbow colours, plus navy blue for the border. When my new yarn arrived I found that the new ball of the pink was much brighter than the old one. I used it anyway and I don't think you notice the difference in the finished blanket.The new pink is on the left, the old on the rightI finished my blanket with a simple border, one round of trebles and then a round of crab stitch to give it a bit of body.Should you want to try this pattern, it's available as a free download from my Ravelry Shop. Of course, you could use other yarn and vary the size too (mine is a baby blanket) but, be warned, this stitch makes a seriously heavy fabric so don't get too ambitious. The mini marshmallow stitch would make good bags and cushions too. I'm thinking of working out how to do it in the round and designing a circular cushion, perhaps in pastel colours.I'm much more of a bright colours than a pastel person but I've been challenging myself lately to use some paler shades. An example of this would be the Primrose Garden crochet I showed you last week which I'm making progress with now. I know it's still quite bright but, for me, this is a very understated colour palette.That's four of the long hexagons sewn together, plus four top squares. I love the fact that the squares really look as if they're laid on top of a bigger square - just the effect I was looking for."},
{"title": "Temperature Blanket", "date": "Thursday 14 March 2019", "text": "Every day this year I'm recording the maximum temperature where I live so as to be able to work it into my Temperature Blanket.This is the plan I've drawn up; each triangle represents one day, the squares with arrows are the month labels and the grey squares are the border. That bit on the side with the red squares is going to be the key. There will be a square for each of the 19 colours I'm using, with the temperature range they represent embroidered on the front. The light grey rectangle above the key is for some sort of title. I haven't decided what to put on that yet - although it needs to be short as I hate doing the embroidery.When I was planning this blanket I had fun making a mini colour key to refer to each day.I wove these little squares on my 2\" loom from Hazel Rose and then stuck on labels with the temperatures on. Each one represents two degree in Celsius, ranging from below 0° to above 35°. I've used blues, purples and greens so far; its been unseasonably mild here, I didn't expect to get to the greens for several months. I haven't used the lightest shade of blue as the maximum temperature has always been above freezing.This is the rest of my Temperature Blanket kit ...This old suitcase holds the plan, the colour key and my looms and tools. The looms are the Tiny Weaver Set, again from Hazel Rose. The finished squares are about 3½\" and the triangles half that size. The green notebook is where I make a note of the maximum and minimum temperatures every day and a few words on each day's weather. The most dramatic day so far was last Sunday when we had sunshine, rain, hail, snow and then sun again. The suitcase slides under the settee so it's handy but doesn't get in the way. So, this is how my blanket has grown so far ...First Few DaysMost of JanuaryJanuary and FebruaryAnd this is what it looks like today, half way through March ...It actually looks better in photos than it does in real life. It's very lumpy and bumpy and I think the squares are turning out a bit bigger than two triangles. I'm hoping that a good blocking will sort out most of this - that and a crochet edging to tame down the waves. But I can't really do that until it's finished so I shall have to have faith until then. I'm a great believer in blocking to solve most yarn-related problems. I only found out recently that wet blocking isn't supposed to work on acrylic yarns; I've been wet blocking acrylic stuff successfully for years.The embroidery is nerve-wracking to do; I'm using chain stitch and all was going well until I had to do the square for March. Turns out it's much harder to embroider vertical writing than horizontal - the 'r' is virtually off the square.Things I like about this project:It's made me notice the weather more (even if I tend to reply to innocent statements like \"it was cold yesterday, wasn't it?\" with statements like \"yes, 2.9°\", I really must stop doing that).I love playing with colour - oh the excitement when I get to use a new one.Each triangle only takes about ten minutes to weave and add to the blanket.Things I don't like:Weaving in all the ends. I'm using my yarn doubled so there are four for each triangle and I'm not very good at hiding them.Embroidering the writing (see above).How uneven it looks at the moment.I think it will all turn out all right in the end though. I quite wish I'd included the minimum temperatures too - perhaps using one strand of colour for the minimum and one for the maximum. I'm wondering about making another temperature blanket next year, using the same colours but a different technique. Perhaps I shall crochet it and use the minimum colour for the centre of each day's shape.I think, actually, the best thing about this project is that I'm working on something that I haven't designed myself. It's nice to be a follower for a change."},
{"title": "Colour Experiments", "date": "Saturday 9 March 2019", "text": "Every so often I get obsessed with a new idea and have to work on it at all hours and to the exclusion of everything else. It doesn't matter how many designs I'm already working on (nine or more, since you ask), I just can't leave it alone.A few weeks ago I started doodling geometric tiled shapes and seeing what happened when I coloured them in different ways.\"That was interesting\" I thought, \"maybe I could use that for a crochet pattern one day. Not now obviously because I've got too many things on the go already.\" So I put the sketches away, feeling smug at my self control. Then this happened ...In my defence, I did wait a whole day before starting to crochet. The plan I was trying to recreate is a combination of squares and elongated hexagons which gives the effect of squares on top of squares.Can you see the big squares tilted on their points and the smaller, straight squares on top of them? I thought I could vary the texture on the different sections so that the top squares were quite complex and the ones underneath were simpler. Working out a textured pattern for the top squares was quite straightforward. This is the start - I wasn't quite sure whether to start with a neutral cream or one of the colours.I decided I didn't like the cream in the middle and that I wanted to see more of the central colour.As you can see, I've added a few rounds and finished the squares off with a cream crab stitch edging. I'm rather pleased with this edging as it will stand above the rest of the crochet, marking the edges of the squares. I'm planning to use it on the bigger squares too so that the eye is drawn to them.Isn't it interesting how different those two squares look, just by swapping the colours round. I think I like the one with the green in the middle best. So far, so good but then I started questioning my colour choices. Now I really like shades of blue and green like this and I've used them quite a lot.This is Stylecraft Special DK in, from left to right, Grass Green, Kelly Green, Green, Cream, Royal, Lapis, Aster and Cloud Blue. But ... my original idea was for something a bit more subtle and here I was, back with my bright primaries.I had the idea of using two sets of colours - one for these top squares and another for the squares underneath. I wanted to divide up the squares underneath too so that the outer section matched the top squares. This gave me elongated hexagons that looked like this.This was my first attempt. If you imagine four of these sewn together at the red points, you can see that you'd get a red / orange / yellow square (with cream edging) and then a bit more of the blue and green. Again, I'd gone for some of my favourite bright colours. From left to right, Garnet, Lipstick, Pomegranate, Tomato, Spice, Sunshine and Saffron. Not that I use this yarn a lot but I can name lots of them by sight. I fiddled around with the actual design, making the red section more textured and increasing the blue / green part which was better.But I wasn't really happy with my colours. However much I like them, I couldn't really call them subtle and, when I put the two shapes together, the whole thing was definitely far too busy.So, it was back to the drawing board - or, rather, back to the  yarn pegs. These are so useful for choosing colours. After a brief flirtation with mixing up some random colours ...Citron, Candyfloss, Empire, Silver, Turquoise, Lemon and Fuchsia Purple... quite pretty but not really me, I tried a more orderly range of greens and mauves. There's a colour name you don't often hear now - mauve - conjures up memories of the 1970s for me and the blue rinsed hair of my Great Aunty Eva.Petrol, Storm Blue, Duck Egg, Cream, Parma Violet, Lavender and VioletI quite liked this one, although I can't say it's particularly exciting. I thought the cream section might be too big in the first one so I swapped it with the palest mauve  the second time round ... but then it changed the shape of the central motif from a square to something more like a cross.I did feel I was getting nearer to my original idea though; something Spring-like that would make you think of the new season's flowers. So, after more playing around with colour pegs, I came up with this.Now these colours I like. They shout \"Primroses\" and \"Sunshine\" to me; I can feel enthusiastic about them. From left to right, they are Lime, Mustard, Citron, Lemon, Pistachio, Meadow and Cypress - even the names sound like spring (although possibly not mustard).Here are two squares with the colours swapped round; I think the one with the yellows on the outside is lovely and sunny.I couldn't decide between them so I knitted two of the long hexagons, one starting with the greens and one with the yellows. The colours seem to work best if both the top and bottom squares start with the same colours so here is the 'green first' version ...... and here's the yellow one ...I think I prefer this one; somehow it looks better with the slightly darker greens on the outside, more like the leaves round the flowers perhaps? I'm happy with the textures too. The top square has a range of stitches and textures, the yellow bottom square is a simple ridged pattern and the green on the outside is just double crochet, changing colours every row to give a muted, blended effect.Finally, after many late nights and a lot of crochet, I think I know what I'm doing now with this design. The next thing to do is to weigh all the balls of yarn I'm going to be working from to keep track of how much yarn the pattern uses. I won't be able to include the two shapes I've already crocheted but I'll add on a bit for them when I work out the final amounts. I'm not sure how big this needs to be to look good, or what I'm going to do with the edges ('cut off' the green sticky out bits or add half hexagons?) but at least I can make progress now. I'd like to call it something to do with primroses I think - not 'Primrose Path' though which is a fun-filled path that leads to disaster. Any other suggestions?"},
{"title": "Three Villages", "date": "Friday 8 March 2019", "text": "Earlier this week my son had a free day so we grabbed the chance for a country walk. He's a supply teacher so doesn't know if he's working on any day until the last moment. Luckily, it was a fine day (apart from one rather vicious shower which coincided with a struggle up a windswept slope) and not too muddy, given that we live in an area of heavy clay which can weigh you down pretty quickly.We walked out of the top of Banbury towards Drayton village and then turned off to head across the fields towards this ...Yes, it's an obelisk in the middle of a muddy field. The Wroxton Obelisk was built in the middle of the 18th Century to commemorate the Prince of Wales' visit to the area, apparently he went to the races in Banbury. They felt the obvious way to celebrate this was to put up a big bit of stone, complete with latin inscription, which we struggled to translate in the rain. The obelisk was originally part of the landscaped grounds of the Wroxton Estate, as was this Folly which dates from about the same time.The architect was one Sanderson Miller and we came across one more of his wonderful creations when we got to Wroxton.It looks like a mini castle on a hill but is actually a Dovecote. This is what's known as an 'eyecatcher' basically something to look pretty as you look across your extensive estate.Wroxton House is a Jacobean country house, built on the site of an old abbey and is now a College for students from Fairleigh Dickinson University in the United States.This is actually the back of the building; the public can explore the grounds as long as they don't picnic or bring a dog so we did. There were masses of daffodils up but not out yet on the banks, it will be a mass of yellow soon. You can walk through the trees and admire this beautiful lake; it's a very peaceful place.The village of Wroxton is a typical small English village, complete with duck poind.I do like it when the ducks have their own thatched cottage. It was re-thatched a couple of years ago which must have been a tricky undertaking. You could just see some eggs inside the doorway. It doesn't show up very well in the photo but the pond has a lovely new iron railing too; I'm partial to a nice bit of cast iron.We had planned to stop for a pub lunch at Wroxton but its two pubs are both closed down so we carried on across country towards North Newington. On the way we stopped to admire some of the first of this season's lambs.Note the lamb using a sheep as a stepI was trying to master my new compass on this walk but the path between Wroxton and North Newington was pretty straightforward ...The ways between two villages are often very old, following the easiest and straightest route, trodden by people for many years.North Newington's pub has the enticing name of 'The Blinkin' Owl' but, guess what, that was closed too. So, on we went, this time heading for Broughton village.The footpath comes into the village through the grounds of Broughton Castle which is a moated manor house mostly dating from the sixteenth century. It's the home of Lord and Lady Saye and Sele whose family name is Fiennes. This name is thought by some to be the origin of the 'Fine Lady' who famously rode her horse to Banbury Cross. The castle is open to the public on Wednesday and Sunday afternoons in the summer and is well worth a visit. It's been used as a location for various films, including the BBC's 'Wolf Hall' and 'Shakespeare in Love' so some parts might seem rather familiar.There is a pub in Broughton village but it was of course closed. To be fair, it was three o' clock by now and they had been open at lunchtime. So we plodded on, heading back to Banbury via the Salt Way, one of our oldest paths.We finally found an open pub in the shape of  The Easington where we enjoyed a pint of cider and a delicious vegetarian toad-in-the-hole. They have an actual vegetarian and vegan menu with real choices which was very exciting. I do get tired of having to seek out the vegetarian options on menus which often turn out to be few and far between and dull. It was really nice to be able to choose between several interesting options.It was a good start to my walking week - just over ten miles. Since getting a cheap pedometer at the start of last year, I've been keeping track of how far I walk in an attempt to do more. Last year I walked over 600 miles so I'm hoping to do more than that in 2019. There's been too much work and not enough getting out so far this year so more days like this are called for."},
{"title": "Scrapbook for January", "date": "Friday 1 March 2019", "text": "I've finally managed to put together the scrapbook pages for the first month of  My Year in Yarn. It might look simple but this took me ages. I couldn't work out how to arrange it all, what fonts to use, what to back the printouts with ... oh yes, and my ink cartridges ran out.Things started to look up when I found these scrapbooking and origami papers in The Works.I thought I could use the bigger sheets for big chunks of text and the origami paper for titles and other bits and bobs. And you can never have too much origami paper anyway.Paper Kawaii's Origami Star Here's the first page with a key to the yarn block.I rather like the look of the black photo corners, even if they did keep sticking to my clothes as I was fitting them to the papers. I was tempted to add lots of stickers and other pretty stuff but I thought that would make the whole thing much more time consuming and set a precedent for the rest of the year. I can always go back and add them later if the fancy takes me.On the second page I've been a bit daring and added an origami model of an envelope box. This was the inspiration for my Pocket Box pattern which I published a few days ago.Maybe this will entertain my future hypothetical grandchildren when they're forced, yet again, to look through their Grandmother's boring yarn scrapbook. The paper box opens by pulling the triangle flaps apart and it took me ages to think of a way to replicate this in knitting. Eventually I decided on stocking stitch rolls which hold the top together.I'm not including pictures of everything I work on - the early stages of many projects aren't particularly photogenic - but I will try to put in a photo of anything that gets finished each month. The only thing I actually finished in January was my Old-Fashioned Tea Cosy, although I did add a picture of my Mini Marshmallow crochet to fill up the last page.One of the advantages of keeping track of everything I work on like this is that it makes me get on with things that have been languishing for a while. This crochet is a good example. I needed more yarn and hadn't got round to ordering it and, to be honest, I was a bit daunted by how much I still had to do on this one. After writing about it here, I got on and ordered the yarn from Wool Warehouse who, as is their wont, delivered it in next to no time. Since then I've been powering away and mini marshmallow stitches are flying off my hook. The blanket is now nearly square so, if I can keep going like this, it might even be finished one day.And now that March is here I can start putting together February's block ..."},
{"title": "January in Yarn", "date": "Thursday 21 February 2019", "text": "I'm finally making some progress with my yarn diary, which is exactly what it sounds like - a record in yarn of everything I work on this year. I came up with this daft idea months ago and wrote about it here My Year in Yarn. The idea is to create a patchwork block each month, with each piece representing a knitting or crochet project that you've worked on. You use the same yarn as the project and I've worked out several ways of knitting and crocheting squares that don't need you to work out your tension first. Should you want to join me in this, there's a free pattern here to help you get started.I shall be making one 8\" patchwork square for each month, edging them with a garter stitch border and then sewing them together to make a blanket. I also want to record the details of all the projects in a scrapbook as I go. Here are the non-yarn things I've got to help me make this work.It took me ages to decide on what to use for my scrapbook. I've got an aversion to notebooks with instructions on the front like 'Be Happy' or 'Book of Special Things' (I've made those two up but you know what I mean) and I didn't want to use an album with sticky pages. Can you tell I've got a daughter who's an archivist? In the end, on her advice, I settled for this inexpensive, black ringbound album from Hobbycraft. It's got black pages and I shall use black photo corners like these to stick things in.I want to include a picture of each month's block with a key to each of the projects on it and a bit more information about each of them. I think I'll add photos of finished things too and anything that might make it more interesting for people to read in the future. I've got a drawer of scrapbooking bits and pieces upstairs that I shall sort through to see what I've got to make the pages pretty.I've also got a small notebook where I make notes of everything I work on each month. I tend to have lots and lots of projects on the go at once so it's easy to forget some. The notes include whether it's a knitting or crochet project (or, in my case, weaving too) and details about the yarn and needles or hooks used. This is useful when I come to make the patches, sometimes weeks later.The square thing with the brightly coloured squares is my mini design board. I made this from some card and a scrap of wadding to help me work out the design each  month. The little card shapes are half size so I've written the sizes they represent on them to stop me getting confused. This arrangement is one of the possibilities were I to work on 14 projects one month.In January the total was a more modest ten - seven knitting, one crochet, one Tunisian crochet and one weaving. I'm also weaving a temperature blanket this year but I'm not including that as it's its own diary. So, this is my patchwork square for January ...I have to say it didn't look lovely and flat like this when I'd finished it. All those different yarns made for a very lumpy and bumpy square; luckily, blocking sorted that out.So, starting at the top left, we have a big green variegated square representing a blanket I'm weaving on one of my Hazel Rose pin looms. I thought I'd be clever and weave this square, forgetting that this particular loom produces squares smaller than 4\". I added a round of crochet to make it up to size. This is the wonderful James C Brett Marble Chunky and I'm using two shades to make a simple blanket of squares.Next to that big square are four little 2\" squares. The one at the top (mostly blue) is some variegated sock yarn that I'm using to knit my son a pair of gloves. These are going very slowly as I have to wait to see him so that he can try them on to check the fit at every stage. I'm up to the fingers on the first glove at the moment so they'll probably be finished just in time for Summer.The red square with the grey stripe in the middle is more thin 4 ply, this time from a new design I'm working on which I think I shall call 'Pocket Box'. It's a small, folding purse inspired by origami, something like my Pinwheel Purse pattern. The last one is blocking now and then I just want to try a DK version before I write it up.The cream square is from my Secret Garden blanket which I finished earlier this month so that will appear one more time in February's block. The light green square next to it is actually sparkly, although it doesn't show up in the photograph. This is more thin 4 ply yarn, this time King Cole Party Glitz which I'm using to knit the  mini stockings I attach to my Christmas presents each year. If I don't start knitting them in January, they don't get done.I've used a variation of my old Mini Stocking pattern which I worked out as I went along until the proportions seemed about right. This yarn seems particularly thin but it knitted up nicely. This colour is called 'Elf' and I've also got a ball of red, called 'Santa' so that's what I'll be using next year. If anyone would like a copy of this pattern (mostly notes, not pictures), let me know and I'll send it to  you. That's the top half of the block. Now for the five patches on the bottom.Starting at the top left again, the green and red square represents my Old-Fashioned Tea Cosy which I knitted to fit my 'new' 100 year old silver plated teapot. You can read more about it in Miss Clare's Teapot. By the way, this is the warmest tea cosy I've ever used; it keeps the tea hot for hours so, if you live in a cold house like me, you might like to try one of these.The blue and green square next to it is in crochet, just a few of the rainbow colours I'm using to make what I'm calling a 'Mini Marshmallow Blanket'. I'm starting to wish I'd been a bit less ambitious with this one - perhaps a 'Mini Marshmallow Cushion Cover' instead? I do love blankets though.I've ground to a halt now as I need to order more yarn. Just looking at the picture is making me want to get it out again.The stripey square in the bottom left corner looks nothing like the original yarn which has long colour runs. I'm using two shades of Schoppel Wolle Edition 3 to knit triangles in the round and then piece them together into a star pattern. I haven't got any photos to show you yet but it's going to be colourful. The two shades I'm using are called English Garden and Laundry Day - wonderful names.The blue square next to it is more crochet - this time double ended Tunisian Crochet. I'm still at the early stages with this one as I had a lot of trouble with my tension and then had to order a new hook. It's going to be a reversible waistcoat - I know, I don't do clothes, what am I thinking? - this is the blue side, it's mostly dark grey on the back.The last square is the big red one, more James C Brett - this time Aran with Wool. I've only just started this project which is going to be a shawl thing called 'The Big Red Wrap'. I'm using a herringbone stitch pattern which is rather nice but, even with thick yarn, this one's going to take me a while.So, that's what I was working on in January. I've started several more projects this month and only finished one so far so there could be even more in next month's block. Now I need to get on with the scrapbook pages for January. If only that blank book wasn't so daunting ..."},
{"title": "Winding Wool", "date": "Monday 18 February 2019", "text": "How do you wind your wool? Do you use a swift, a ball winder or the back of a chair?  This is assuming that you buy skeins of yarn of course. I remember when most yarn came in skeins and, nowadays, they're back in fashion again. Which is where the wool winders come in ...I have several old wool winders or swifts, picked up in antique shops over the years. Yesterday, I added to my collection with this little gem.It's an Aero Wool Winder which I should think dates from the 1950s, complete with its original box and instruction leaflet. This tells us that \"thousands of satisfied persons are using this aid to better knitting\" - so now you know. It also suggests that you can use the winder to unravel old garments to re-use the yarn and that it will take out all the kinks; I'm not so sure about that.Anyway, it all goes together smoothly and the arms can be extended to fit the skein.It's a compact little device and would be handy to take with you when travelling. It works in much the same way as the first swift I found - this wooden one.Again, you clamp the holder to a table and then extend the arms to hold the skein of  yarn.As you can see, this one has four arms instead of three. It also has a little cup on the top to hold your ball of yarn if all that winding is too much like hard work and you have to stop for a rest.My other two wool winders are completely different in shape and function and I think they're probably both older than the others too. The first one clamps to a table and has two little cages to hold the yarn. These are sometimes called 'squirrel cage swifts', although it would be a very small squirrel that fitted in one of these.I think this one probably had a cup for the yarn on the top as it looks like there's something missing there. It's a bit unsteady and I haven't used it much.The last winder in my collection is another squirrel cage design but this one is much bigger and stands firmly on the floor. You can adjust the position of the cages up and down the stand with the wooden pegs that go right through them.This one's probably my favourite; I like the fact that I can use it wherever I want, without having to find something to clamp it to.Another useful little device to go with your wool winder is a ball winder. These wind your yarn into centre pull 'cakes' - much easier to knit from.Here I'm winding the yarn from a ball but you can also set up a table top swift next to the ball winder and do two jobs at once. I bought this little winder from a charity shop for £1 (of course I did, and no, in case you're wondering, I don't have much new stuff in my house).While waiting to find an antique wool winder you could of course wind your wool in the old-fashioned way by co-opting a willing (or unwilling) child to hold your skein while you wind. My Mother grew up in the war surrounded by female relatives who all knitted a lot and she used to swear that she slept with her arms held out, just in case one of them wanted to wind some wool."},
{"title": "Secret Garden", "date": "Wednesday 13 February 2019", "text": "Today I want to talk about a project that I've thoroughly enjoyed working on over the last year. Normally my designs are simple, brightly coloured and quick to knit. This one is the complete opposite of that.As you can see, this is a highly textured blanket, knitted in thin, cream yarn. My camera hates taking pictures of cream coloured things so I apologise for the poor quality of the photos in this post - I did the best I could.Anyway, back to the knitting. This baby blanket is called Secret Garden and has neatly laid out flower beds, moss stitch paths and a brick patterned border. It's named after the book of the same name The Secret Garden by Frances Hodgson Burnett in which orphan Mary Lennox discovers a neglected garden hidden behind a wall.Patterns for blankets like this were very popular in Victorian times. Often featuring leaves and other designs from nature, they were knitted in fine cream or white cotton, using thin needles. They were commonly made up of diagonally knitted squares which, when put together, revealed complex patterns.'Weldon's Practical Knitter' featured patterns for these sorts of blankets - or quilts as they were sometimes known. You can still come across original editions of Weldons like this bound collection which I bought some years ago.In between the many patterns for baby clothes and what can only be called substantial nether garments are some absolutely beautiful blanket patterns. This one is from a special edition titled 'How To Knit Pretty Designs For Quilts And Borders', published in 1891. It's called Corinthian pattern.In the same edition there's this 'Open Bay-Leaf Pattern for Quilt Square' - lots of leaves on this one.Or, for something more modern looking, what about this one?It's referred to as a ridge hexagon but I have seen blocks of this shape called Sexagons in early patterns too.Should you want to get some of these old magazines for yourself, I can thoroughly recommend buying the digital editions from Interweave Press. They sell them as individual issues or in collections. I buy new ones every so often and then print them out and keep them in files; I need to get some more I think, they've got lots I haven't bought yet. They also have digital editions of Weldon's Practical Crochet and Weldon's Practical Stocking Knitter, as well as lots of exciting modern titles too. For those interested in knitting history the Knitting Traditions magazines are excellent. I used to order these as actual magazines but the UK stockist had so many problems getting them from the US that they gave up in the end. Maybe I should fill the gaps in my collection with digital issues? I should warn you that Victorian knitting patterns are not easy to follow and there may well be mistakes in the instructions so be prepared to do a bit of work to 'translate' them. If you prefer your vintage patterns re-worked and tested then another excellent resource is this book, Knitting Counterpanes by Mary Walker Phillips. In the introduction to this Dover edition Meg Swansen refers to Phillips as one of the 'Big Three' in the knitting world, together with Barbara Walker (she of the wonderful Treasuries of Knitting) and, of course, Meg's own mother Elizabeth Zimmermann - she who must be named whenever knitters gather together.This book talks about the history of this sort of knitting, as well as providing lots of lovely patterns and advice on designing your own unique blanket. I particularly like this swirly circle ...... and how about this beautiful octagon?After all that wonderful inspiration, would you like to hear a bit more about my own blanket? I based my design on the 'Garden Plot'square in Mary Thomas's 1943 Book of Knitting Patterns. I wrote about the start of this project about a year ago in Woolly Plans but, basically, what I did was to take the original square and translate it into something smaller and more to my taste. I've kept the original corner leaves but have replaced the line of leaves with bells and added moss stitch paths. There are 24 squares in the blanket, each one has about 100 rows and takes several hours to knit.This is knitting that shouldn't be rushed, it needs to be taken steadily, enjoying the process of creating something beautiful. When you start sewing the squares together you see more of the pattern. First this ...... and then this ...I surprised myself by how much I enjoyed knitting the border on to this blanket - yes, even with all those hundreds of stitches on the needle. It actually didn't take that long and makes all the difference.Honestly, it looks much nicer in real life (and is actually cream coloured, not dirty beige). I hope you'll be inspired by this to start your own garden blanket, either mine or another one. These really are heirlooms for the future.Now I can get on with one of the many other blankets I'm working on ... like the new Ten Stitch for example. I'd really like to finish that soon."},
{"title": " Picking up the Clarinet", "date": "Tuesday 29 January 2019", "text": "What was your 'thing' when you were a child? Did you play sport, dance, act ...? My thing was music. I began learning the recorder at primary school and then moved on to the piano. When I was about ten or eleven I started going to a weekend music school where everyone played in the orchestra as well as their normal lessons. Funnily enough, the orchestra didn't need lots of pianists but there was only one clarinet player. So, I started learning the clarinet too.During the years since then I've always played the piano and have developed my recorder playing to include alto and tenor recorders as well as my original soprano. But ... the clarinet has been neglected. I'm enjoying learning the violin and I started wondering if I should get my clarinet out again ... which is when I discovered that clarinets don't like being left in their cases for decades. The foam lining of the case had disintegrated all over the place and lots of the pads were dry and cracked. I have to say it reduced me to tears.Then I pulled myself together and emailed my local music shop Presto Music who suggested I take it in for them to have a look at. Fast forward some months and look what I've just collected ...One working clarinet, complete with a brand new case (no nasty foam this time), reeds. grease and cleaning thingy. That last was a revelation to me; when I last played, we still used those brushes on a stick to clean our instruments. Now there are things called 'pull throughs' which are basically cloths with a weighted cord on the end. You feed the weight down through the clarinet and then pull the cloth through after it - very clever.So far, so good. Now was the time to wonder whether I'd be able to play it after all this time (40 years). Having decided I needed to start from the beginning again, I got some soft reeds and fished out my original books.My very first book was this one, A Tune a Day for Clarinet Book One which is still in print (although they've updated the cover just a bit). My copy cost 40p too, rather than the £6.99 it would set you back now.Anyway, this book takes you through the notes, one by one and also has detailed instructions on putting the instrument together and the embouchure - that's how you position your mouth to make a sound.I was relieved to find that I remembered how to assemble the clarinet and how to put the reed on. The embouchure was fine too but ... it took me ten minutes to be able to play a single note. I'm not sure if it was me or the reed that needed warming up but, eventually, it all started to work. I can now play about a dozen notes and it's starting to come back to me slowly. Each new note is vaguely familiar and my breathing is getting better too. I'm hoping that, at some point, it'll all suddenly 'click' into place. I think I'm probably progressing more quickly than I would if  I'd never played and I'm enjoying the challenge. The clarinet is a beautiful instrument; I'd forgotten how much I loved its sound. For those of you who aren't familiar with it, here's Dimitri Schenker playing Norbert Burgmuuler's Duo for Clarinet and Piano, written in 1834, just two years before the composer's death at the age of 26."},
{"title": "Finished Blankets", "date": "Thursday 24 January 2019", "text": "Over a year ago I published the first of fifty knitting patterns for a sampler blanket called Frankie's Blankie. All through 2018 I released a new pattern every week; some were simple knit and purl designs using one colour, others were multi-coloured slip stitch patterns. The whole thing was finished off this month with patterns for a knitted on border and a colourful edging.As you can imagine, this was a lot of work to design and, as normal, I had my moments of wondering whether anyone would actually want to undertake such a big project, stretching over a long time. I needn't have worried. Lots of knitters rose to the challenge and one of the best things about the last year has been the community that has grown up round the blankie on my Ravelry group. We've talked about anything and everything, supported each other through difficult times ... oh yes, and compared notes on our knitting too.Quite a few people have finished their blankets now (how impressive is that?) so I thought I'd share a few of their photos here. let's start with this one ...This is Amity's blanket. Amity is from the US but currently living in England. All year I've been admiring her choice of variegated yarn for her contrast colour and the finished blanket is lovely. Note the cat in the bottom photo - what is it with cats and knitting? Whenever I pin out a blanket to block, my two always step carefully over the pins and lie down in the middle of it. Even if it's something quite small, they'll do their best to squeeze their furry bottoms onto it.As you can see, Amity and I aren't the only ones that this happens to ...Clockwise from the top left that's blankets by Amity, Anysia, Debbie and Monika. Monika's blanket isn't actually finished yet but her cat already approves. Lida from the Netherlands doesn't actually have a cat but she didn't let that stop her ...Isn't that a lovely knitted cat? The stripes are the colours in the blanket - now I need to knit a toy to match my blanket too. Should you want to knit yourself a cat, it's a free pattern called The Window Cat by Sara Elizabeth Kellner. Sara has a beautiful blog called Rabbit Hole Knits with lots more toy patterns to tempt you.Now where was I? Ah yes, finished blankets. Here's Lida's blanket without the cat; I love all those fresh, modern colours.And look at the border on Anysia's blanket - I think this is inspired.I'm going to steal that idea for a multi-coloured border one day. Again, this blanket looks so bright and modern.There are several red and white blankets which I think are particularly attractive; you can't go wrong with red and white. This one is Hilary's and the next one is Shelley's.I've really enjoyed seeing all the different colourways knitters have chosen for their blankets. This one, by Maggie, has given us sunshine all year.Regina's colours are much closer to mine but I think hers looks nicer somehow.Some of the best blankets are being made from stash yarns. This one, knitted by Jackie, is a good example.You can read about Jackie's blanket on her blog Finally Finishing. In a year she's gone from someone who could knit and purl to this. Isn't that brilliant?There are lots more blankets that are nearly finished and more being knitted this year so I'll try to show you some more later on this year. Thank-you to everyone who's made the blankie journey such fun."},
{"title": "Miss Clare's Teapot", "date": "Tuesday 15 January 2019", "text": "Has anyone else read the 'Miss Read' books? Miss Read was the pen name of Dora Saint who wrote two long series of books in the second half of the twentieth century. The Thrush Green books are set not far from where I live, being based on the village of Wood Green. You can do a tour of the village on the blog House-Elf Doings if you'd like to see it in real life.I think my favourite series though is her first, the Fairacre series. Beginnng with Village School, Miss Read writes in the person of a village schoolmistress and, throughout twenty books, we follow the children and their families through the years. Dora Saint was a schoolteacher so she knew of what she wrote.The books were illustrated with beautiful drawings by John Goodall which really serve to bring the characters to life. Miss Read has a reputation as a 'cosy' author who glossed over the realities of village life but this is simply not true. There are neglected children, damp cottages and plenty of poverty to be found in the books but the overall tone is a positive one.'So, who is Miss Clare?' I hear you cry. Miss Clare is an older colleague of Miss Read's, one of the old pupil teachers who lost their men in the First World War and remained single. Miss Read values her friendship and visits her often after Miss Clare has had to retire. In Storm in the Village, the two friends share tea ...'She had brought out the family silver teapot for the occasion, a wonderful fluted object with a yellowed ivory knob like a blanched almond.'Now this teapot really caught my imagination when I read this and, ever since, I've been looking out for one like it in my visits to antique shops. It turns out that teapots with black knobs are much easier to find; I suspect that they replaced the old ivory ones. I carried on looking for years, keeping my fingers crossed that, when I finally found my teapot, it wouldn't be too expensive.Finally, on a trip to Banbury Antiques early in the New Year, there it was - on the first stall I looked at and only £12.There were some nervous moments as I tested that it didn't leak - I really wanted to use this teapot, not just keep it as an ornament. And ... it's fine, watertight and pours like a dream. Metal teapots nearly always pour better than china ones. So the next thing to do was to knit my new teapot its own cosy. That shape meant that none of my others were the right size. Miss Read doesn't mention whether Miss Clare's teapot had a cosy but, if it had, I think it would have been one like this ...If you look through old knitting patterns from the middle of the twentieth century, you'll find lots of tea cosies knitted in this pleated pattern. The yarns are carried tightly across the back of the work, resulting in a very thick fabric. These cosies are particularly warm, dating as they do from before the days of central heating. My old house is always cold in winter so this seemed the ideal sort of pattern for me to use.The most tricky part was the shaping. The top of the teapot is nearly flat so I had to decrease stitches rapidly while still keeping the stitch pattern going. After lots of unsuccessful tries, I eventually got it right. The cosy is knitted in two identical parts and joined so that the pattern continues uninterrupted.Now I can enjoy my pot of tea, knowing that the last cup will be as hot as the first. Should you by any chance have a teapot of a similar shape, you can download the free pattern for my Old-Fashioned Tea Cosy from my design page on ravelry. For a normal, rounded teapot you'll want to start the shaping earlier and space it out much more. One day I might design a matching cosy for round teapots but not now."},
{"title": "A New Doll for Christmas", "date": "Monday 7 January 2019", "text": "Should you have been lucky enough to get a new doll for Christmas about ninety years ago, it might have looked like this ...This is the most recent doll illustrated in the new book my son gave me as a New Year present. I say 'new book', it was actually published in 1928 and is called 'Ancient & Modern Dolls'. It was written and illustrated by Gwen White who was an artist who wrote books on design. I recognised her work immediately as I have her book on toys in my collection of King Penguin books.Aren't these two of the most beautiful book covers ever? Look at the endpapers in the dolls book ...Both books feature toys and dolls from museum collections (with details of where to see them) and are written in a friendly style. Here are some early toys in the smaller book ...... and some very old dolls from my new book ...I love the little story about the handkerchief that goes with this 19th century doll ...This is a book to treasure. I've just been looking to see what else Gwen White published and came across a book called 'A World of Pattern', published in 1957 which looks like the most perfect book for me ever. Just saying, Jack. You might need to start saving now.Anyway, I may not have got a new doll for Christmas this year but I did buy an old one a few days later. I found her on a trip to Brackley Antiques and I think she's lovely. She's a Rosebud Doll from between 1955 and 1960 which makes her just a bit older than me. Rosebud started making soft vinyl dolls in the 1950s and soft is the word, she's slightly squeezy to the touch. Her dress looks to be the original and she also came with a hat. She's not allowed to wear that anymore though as it had made her hair a very funny shape. I've carefully washed her and sorted out her hair and I've washed and mended her clothes. There's a stiff petticoat under than dress - very 1950s. She didn't come with shoes but has flat feet so I think she would have had them originally. I found some to fit and then made her a pair of socks out of a finger bandage. I think a white cardigan with tiny pearl buttons would be nice too.I haven't been able to find a picture of this particular doll online so if anybody recognises her, I'd love to hear from you. It would be great to find a catalogue from the time which included her."},
{"title": "My Year in Yarn", "date": "Tuesday 25 December 2018", "text": "Merry Christmas everyone and I hope you're having a lovely day. In case you're wondering, no, I'm not writing this on Christmas Day; I wrote it a few days ago and then saved it to publish today.So, who's ready for a new challenge for 2019? Well, me obviously. As well as working on a woven temperature blanket throughout the year, I'm also going to work on a knitted and crocheted record of everything I make.This is the sort of thing I've got in mind - a series of patchwork blocks, each one made up of squares and rectangles representing all the projects I've worked on that month. I'll use the yarn that I'm using in the actual project so this will be a cheap thing to make. The squares and rectangles will be either knitted or crocheted, depending on the project they represent, and each month's set of blocks will be surrounded with a knitted on border. By the end of the year I'll have a small blanket.If you'd like to join me on this mad journey I've published a pattern for it today which is available free on Ravelry. Actually, it's not so much a pattern as a guide for designing your own patchwork diary. The shapes can be knitted or crocheted and I give you patterns for two versions of each. None of them need you to work out your tension. Magic Knitted Squares and RectanglesCrochet Squares and Rectangles Worked in the RoundI also made a mini design board to help me decide how to arrange my shapes. You can find out how to make and use one of these in the pattern.Of course you don't have to make a blanket and you don't have to divide your blocks up by months either. You could knit or crochet a record of everything you make for a baby in their first year. Or perhaps make a patchwork of all the charity knitting you do. The possibilities are endless and each person's work will be unique.As well as the yarn diary you could also keep a scrapbook to go with it. This could include photos of the finished projects, yarn samples or more information about the people you're making things for. In years to come, the finished piece, together with the scrapbook could become a treasured heirloom for future generations.If you'd like to join me in this adventure, I shall be talking about my progress here and also on my Frankie's Knitted Stuff group on ravelry so do come along and say hello. I think this could be a lot of fun. There won't be any actual knitting or crochet until February so you have a whole month to think about it (and perhaps choose a pretty scrapbook).So, for now, Merry Christmas - may it be filled with yarn."},
{"title": "Winter Wonderland", "date": "Monday 24 December 2018", "text": "Well, I call it my Winter Wonderland, others call it the scullery. This is the tiny room at the back of my kitchen which houses the washing machine, freezer, microwave and various cupboards ... oh, and a few Christmas decorations.This is the view from the kitchen door. The stars hanging at the windows are my Advent Stars which I've used as an advent calendar this year. Do you want to have a closer look at the room? Of course you do. First of all, the tree.This is my 'tasteful' tree, as opposed to the one in the front room which is full of decorations the children have made over the years. What do you mean, you don't have random bits of card and plastic covered with glitter on your tree? Lovely though it is (and the stars made from pasta have survived remarkably well), a few years ago I thought I'd have a special tree, just for me. Lots of the decorations are still homemade but you'll be glad to know that my daughter has got a bit more skilful now. If you click on the photo you'll be able to see a bigger version - see the star gingerbread man and the oval cross stitch decoration? - they're both hers. I sewed some of the others and even crocheted a few snowflakes.Moving round to the big windowsill, you can see lots of familiar decorations, made from my patterns.Most of these were big Christmas patterns on Ravelry; I publish one of these each December. This was the pattern two years ago ...The Night Before ChristmasNext we come to two little Christmas dolls - I'm very fond of these - and, in front of them are some Christmas coasters that I wove and then embroidered a few years ago.Mini Doll ChristmasThen, in the corner, there's the Needle Tree and, next to it, the Gingerbread House.The smaller window has just a few decorations ...Here's the reason there's a gap on that windowsill ...... Tolly cat posing next to the 'Santa's Little Helper' candle holder. He is definitely not one of Santa's helpers though, not unless the job description includes chewing tree decorations and lights (he thinks he's a puppy). Behind his furry bottom is my 3D knitted scene that I made years ago, before I started publishing my designs.The other side of the scullery is taken up with machines and cupboards but that hasn't stopped me decorating it. There's a little cross stitch Santa hanging from the light switch ...... a village on the microwave ...Mrs Christmas is, of course, knitting a stocking... and a tree of stars squeezed in on the worktop ...Stacking StarsIn between the radio and my Featherweight sewing machine is this year's Christmas pattern, A White Christmas.That little lace angel was from a book called Angels: A Knitter's Dozen by Gerdine Crawford-Strong which is a beautiful book. You starch the angels once they're finished so they can stand up.The final thing to see is on the back of the door to the kitchen ... last year's Christmas pattern.Tree SamplerI hope you've enjoyed this tour of my small (but perfectly formed) scullery. Now I'm off for a cup of tea in my own personal Winter Wonderland ..."},
{"title": "At this time of year ", "date": "Thursday 20 December 2018", "text": "At this time of year ... I think of all the single parent families out there, perhaps having their first Christmas together on their own. Being a parent is a hard enough job, being a single parent is twice as hard. My first Christmas as a single parent was 25 years ago now and, as I look forward to my two grown up children coming home for Christmas this weekend, I remember that first one.We were all a lot younger then!I took the phone off the hook (you could do that then) in an attempt to stop well-meaning people phoning \"just to check you're all right\" as the children were opening presents or I was trying to cook. Speaking of which, I didn't even try to do a traditional Christmas dinner that year; the children were too excited to sit down to a proper meal so we had party food laid out on the table and helped ourselves as we wanted. I didn't expect anything to be 'like normal' (just as well, really) and it was chaotic but fun.Since then, we've created our own new Christmas traditions over the years and you'll be glad to know that we managed proper Christmas dinners after that first year - mind you, it took a long time to get them to eat breakfast on Christmas Day.The problems single parent families face are talked about a lot but I don't think you hear enough about the positives. The three of us are a strong team and we always have been. My son and daughter are brilliant; I can call on them at any time if I need to, knowing that they will drop everything and rush to help.We've shared lots of things over the last 25 years - walks, holidays, special food and, perhaps most of all, books. We all love reading, especially children's books; as I write this I can see the two baskets of Christmas books that we've collected over the years. On Christmas Eve we'll take it in turns to read some of our favourites out loud.  Despite being four years apart in age, my son and daughter have always been close. There's a lot to be said for having to do everything together because there's no other parent to leave one child with. Oh, the endless plastic animal games they used to play, slowly moving their vast collection of animals around the house, chatting all the while. Then there was the year I found them putting toys in and out of their Christmas stockings on Christmas Eve - they said they were 'practising for the morning'. They now admit that they were trying to stretch their stockings ... because that's how you get more toys!Don't they look sweet in this one? They would have been about eight and four then, I think. The next photo is a much later one, taken on the day we went to the seaside and they started a fashion on the beach by building a set of sand steps, leading up to the prom.I have no idea what they're doing in the next picture - just being daft I expect. It was taken at my son's graduation (but then you could probably guess that).So, I'd like to wish all the single parent families out there a very Happy Christmas. Do things your own way, stick together and it will get easier. And to Jack and Rose - you're both amazing people and I'm so proud of our team. Oh, and remember, I like big presents!"},
{"title": "Jane Austen in Steventon", "date": "Sunday 16 December 2018", "text": "Probably my favourite way to mark special events is to go for a walk. Meals out are pretty much wasted on me; I'd much rather have a picnic perched on a stile somewhere in the countryside. Back around the start of November my son and I went for two particularly fine walks in honour of my birthday. The first was a beautiful circular walk starting and finishing in Lower Heyford which has a train station right next to the canal, making it very handy for walkers.Lovely though this walk was - a bright, crisp day and full of late autumn colour - the walk I really want to show you today was further afield and something of a pilgrimage.Despite having grown up in North Hampshire, I don't think I've ever been to Steventon, the village where Jane Austen was born and lived until the age of 25. A story in the Austen family has it that she fainted when told that the family were moving to Bath in 1800. Whether or not this is true, she was certainly happy in the Hampshire countryside and talks in her letters of many walks to visit friends in the neighbourhood.We began our walk at the church where her father, George was Rector - St Nicholas.This beautiful, twelfth century church stands alone, surrounded by grass, at the end of a lane from the village. Jane Austen was christened here and it's where she would have worshipped regularly. Fortunately the church wasn't locked so we could see the various monuments to the Austen family inside.This rather grand one is for James Austen, Jane's oldest brother, who succeeded their father as Rector at Steventon. James was considered by many of the Austens to be the literary one of the family. In the 1930s a great grand neice of Jane's erected this more modest but touching memorial to her in the church.It's a lovely church and well worth visiting for its own sake.From the church we set off through the village, past cottages that Jane would certainly have known ...... and out into the countryside. The walk took us along many old hedgrerow lanes like this one which Jane's nephew, Edward Austen-Leigh, said were 'the chief beauty of Steventon'.It was on a walk through a hedgerow like this that Anne Elliot overheard Captain Wentworth and Louisa Musgrove talking as they gathered nuts in Persuasion (and yes, the nut trees are still there).If you can ignore the railway that now cuts through the countryside, it's easy to feel that you are walking in Jane Austen's footsteps. The paths are old and, although many of the buildings she would have known are no longer there, others are still to be seen.This is Ashe Church which was, sadly, locked but the walk took us right past the Rectory, onece the home of Anne Lefroy, Jane's great friend and mentor.Here Jane danced and flirted with Tom Lefroy, her friend's nephew. She wrote to Cassandra about it, I am almost afraid to tell you how my Irish friend and I behaved. Imagine to yourself everything most profligate and shocking in the way of dancing and sitting down together. I can expose myself, however, only once more, because he leaves the country soon after next Friday, on which day we are to have a dance at Ashe after all. Tom Lefroy went on to become Lord Chief Justice of Ireland and, when asked about Jane in his later years, said that he had loved her, but that it was a 'boy's love' - whatever that might mean.Jane and Tom would also have danced at Deane House, home then of the Harwood family.I know this looks grand but the Austen family were not as affluent as the Harwoods. Mr and Mrs Austen only managed by a combination of taking in boarding pupils and farming, a Rector's pay not being sufficient to support a large family.The villages of Steventon and Deane lie on each side of what was, in Jane's day, and still is the road between Andover (where I was born) and Basingstoke. The Austen family collected their letters from the Deane Gate Inn which also served as the coaching post. I remember going to this pub in the 1970s when men in plus fours could still be seen at the bar. The pub closed a few years ago and is now being redeveloped as a restaurant. This is what it looked like on the day of our walk.Just down the lane from the Deane Gate is Cheesedown Farm, once rented by Jane Austen's father; everywhere we walked there were links like this.As I've said, many of the houses Jane would have known are no longer there and this includes Steventon Rectory where the family lived. I knew that you could still find the site of the house by the water pump that once stood at its back and, as we walked back along the lane to the church, we kept looking for it in the surrounding fields. The light was going and the hedges were thick so we were about to give up when we saw a gap in the hedge ...Now it may not look much but that patch of weeds in the middle of the field surrounds the old pump. So this is where the Rectory was. At the back of the site is a gentle hill which brings to mind this description of Catherine Morland, heroine of Northanger Abbey who also grew up in a country Rectory ...she was moreover noisy and wild, hated confinement and cleanliness, and loved nothing so well in the world as rolling down the green slope at the back of the house... a glimpse of the young Jane perhaps?I shall definitely go back to this part of Hampshire for another walk, perhaps to the site of Manydown Park where Jane accepted a marriage proposal ... only to change her mind the next morning. Or maybe to Ibthorpe where her friends Mary and Martha Lloyd lived. Both the sisters would go on to marry Austen brothers in later life.And I must go back to the Chawton House where Jane lived towards the end of her life with her mother and sister, Cassandra. I've just realised that today, 16th December, is the anniversary of Jane Austen's birth in Steventon Rectory in 1775. A nice coincidence.I'll leave the last word to Anne Elliot in Persuasion, on her own autumn walk ...Her pleasure in the walk must arise from the exercise and the day, from the view of the last smiles of the year upon the tawny leaves and withered hedges, and from repeating to herself some few of the thousand poetical descriptions extant of autumn-that season of peculiar and inexhaustible influence on the mind of taste and tenderness-that season which has drawn from every poet worthy of being read some attempt at description, or some lines of feeling."},
{"title": "Ink, Paper, Print", "date": "Tuesday 11 December 2018", "text": "I haven't been able to post for a while because of caring duties but I don't want to skip talking about things I did a while ago. So, if you could just imagine yourself back to late October, I'll pick up where I left off ...At the end of October my daughter and I had a very exciting trip to the seaside. Obviously, a day by the sea is always good and I especially like the seaside in winter but we had an extra reason for this particular day out.Itwas the Ink, Paper & Print art fair in Margate, a wonderful collection of artists andprintmakers selling their wares. The fair was split over two venues, the TurnerContemporary and The Winter Gardens (yes, the one where The Beatles played in 1963). While I think ofit, if you ever get the chance to visit The CavernClub in Liverpool, do go -it's wonderful.Anyway, I'd never been to an art fair before so I didn't know what to expect but it was really good. Each venue was full of artists selling their work and chatting about it. I had thought the prices might be too high for me to actually buy anything but many artists were selling greetings cards cheaply and even the prints weren't too much. Here's a glimpse inside the Winter Gardens ...There were so many talented artists whose work I'd never seen before so I collected quite a few business cards so that I could track them down online. And the good thing about artists' business cards is that they're mini works of art in themselves.Do you want to see some of the cards I bought? Of course you do. These two are by Michael Goodson, a Margate artist who produces his work digitally.'Two Seagulls' and 'Rain-bow-bow' by Michael GodsonHe also has a print of two seagulls leaning into the wind which is great. My favourite print on his stall wasn't available as a card; it's a print called 'Bird & Bear' and I think it's just crying out to be made into a children's book.'Bird & Bear' by Michael GoodsonThese next two are by Clare Youngs who works with fabric and paper to create animals full of patterns.'Black Hen' & 'Flying South' by Clare YoungsClare has also written lots of craft books which look good and her new book, Animal Parade features lots of her collage animals.We spent a long time at the stall shared by Kate and Ruth Sampson, Red Gate Arts. These two artists are inspired by classic art from the Art Deco period and produce prints, posters, book covers and much more. Do explore their website and shop to see what I mean. We bought lots of cards from this stall ...'Happy Birthday' & 'Dawn Chorus' by Kate SampsonI think that dancer is reminiscent of the work of Ravilious. Two more works by Kate ...'Cat at Night' & 'Goodnestone Lemons' by Kate SampsonThe next two are by Ruth ...'Kitchen Cat' & 'After Dark'Just look at all the individual stories unfolding in 'After Dark'. My daughter particularly liked the two London scenes and it turned out that these were both entries for the same competition which had the theme 'Sounds of the City'.I'm going to buy her a print of one of these ... when she makes up her mind which one to have.I dithered for a long time about which print to buy at the fair and eventually settled on this one ...'Lakeside' by Amy GrimesIsn't it beautiful? It's one of the many wonderful prints by Amy Grimes  - I'm so pleased with my print and I don't think it's the only thing I'll be buying from her exciting online shop.One more exciting find at the fair was a roll of sixteen papers, printed from original woodblocks by artists including Ravilious and Enid Marx.These will be great to use to make cards, books, badges ... when I can bring myself to cut into them.After all that, we obviously need chips and a cup of tea by the sea - and it didn't disappoint us. Just look at these waves ...You'd have needed to time it just right to get back to one of those cars without being soaked.After lunch, we wandered around Margate for a while, coming across this lovely Tudor House, now a museum.Then we decided to explore a strange little place we'd read about, hidden away in one of the back streets. The Shell Grotto consists of winding underground passages leading to an underground chamber - all covered with shells laid out in detailed patterns.Not a very good picture, have a look here to see lots more. The grotto was discovered in 1835 but its origins and purpose still remain a mystery. Was it a religious meeting place or just a folly and just how old is it? Sadly, the carbon dating that might help answer these questions is too expensive to be done.All in all, it was an inspiring and thought-provoking day by the sea. Oh, how I love the sea; it was a wrench to leave it."},
{"title": "Lovely Little Looms", "date": "Thursday 25 October 2018", "text": "I have been more that a little obsessed with my collection of pin looms lately. There's something very compelling about being able to weave small pieces so quickly. I started off with my Hazel Rose Multi Looms - that's the two square looms at the top of the picture. These looms have the pins placed in groups of three so that you can weave squares like those worked on old Weave-It Looms which were very popular during the twentieth century in the United States.With this type of weaving you create the warp by wrapping the yarn round the pins in three directions and then use a long needle to weave across. The finished squares have a dimpled edge.Squares woven on the 4\" and 2\" multi loomThat bigger square is one of a pile that I'm weaving with James C Brett's Marble Chunky yarn. I find this is the thickest yarn that I can use on these looms. I'm using two shades and plan to sew them together into a blanket eventually.As for the tiny 2\" loom, that's been useful in planning colours for a new weaving project I'm planning - more of that later.These looms are called multi-looms because you can weave on them in various ways, including diagonally. I've just bought a set of Hazel Rose's looms specially designed for this bias weaving.This is the Tiny Weaver Set, a square and a triangle loom to weave shapes that can be sewn together to make lots of exciting patterns.With this sort of weaving, you wrap the pins and weave at the same time, using a long crochet hook to pull the yarn through.The resulting squares have straight edges and I like the look of the diagonal weave.Straight weaving and diagonal weaveI'm using two more shades of the James Brett Chunky to weave a blanket, using just the square loom from the Tiny Weaver set. You can make all sorts of exciting patterns just with squares. Here's the design I planned after looking through my quilt books.i'm starting in the middle and working outwards in a sort of spiral; this is what I've done so far.Somehow, this looks more like one big piece of fabric than knitted or crocheted squares do when they're sewn together.I haven't forgotten the little triangle loom though; that's going to play a starring part in the Temperature Blanket I'm planning to weave next year. I've been inspired by reading about weavers working on their temperature blankets this year on the Looms To Go ravelry group and I thought it would be nice to have a go too. It took me ages to draw a plan of what I want to do.The main part is going to be made up of woven triangles, one for each day of 2019. I'll weave each triangle in a shade to match that day's temperature. I've got 19 colours ready, one for roughly every two degrees Celsius. The months will be marked by squares and then I'm going to do a key to the colours at the side. The whole thing will be bordered with grey squares. I was going to use navy blue as in this sample but it's just so hard on the eyes to work with very dark colours.I had thought I would have to buy lots of colours in a thick yarn but then I made the happy discovery that two strands of Stylecraft Special DK are just the right weight. Here are a few sample squares ...The two grey squares are samples of my border and month squares. All those little squares are going to be the key to the 19 colours. I've stuck labels on the back of these with the temperature range that each one represents.I'm really looking forward to starting work on this blanket in the New Year. It will be nice to be doing something that isn't one of my own patterns, just like a normal person.The other little loom I want to show you today is very exciting. This is a Turtle Loom from Blueboonet Crafters and, as you can see, you can weave hexagons on this one. These looms come in various sizes and a friend kindly sent me the new Fine Sett Turtle Loom. The pins are close together on this loom which means you can use finer yarns. This is great for me as I have a LOT of leftover thin yarn. The Turtle Looms combine bias and straight weaving which makes them fun to use. First you weave diagonally ...... then you thread your yarn on to a needle and weave back and forth for the rest of the hexagon.By the way, I love the new pencil case I found to hold my weaving tools. Not only is it a beautiful green but it's made of a very tactile silicone. I may have to go back to Office Outlet and get another one. They had a bright blue ... and a yellow ... and ...Anyway, here are my hexagons sewn together.I'm using Hayfield Spirit DK which is a thinnish DK and this will be a scarf. I'm adding the hexagons in rows of three (those dark ones on the right are the last row to be added).Another very exciting thing I've discovered with this loom is that, if I use thin sockweight yarn (about 400 m per 100 g), I can sew two hexagons together to get a hexiflat. When I sew these together, I'll have different colours on each side.These are going to be a cowl when they grow up. I'll use single hexagons at the sides and fold them in half so the finished cowl will have straight sides. Does that make sense? Here's a little mat I made using a double hexagon in the centre and then folded hexagons around it. I may have got just a bit carried away when it came to embroidering those little flowers.I hope you've enjoyed looking at my loom collection. These are such fun to work with, I can really recommend them. In fact, I think I might just do a bit of weaving now ..."},
{"title": "Stacking Stars", "date": "Friday 19 October 2018", "text": "The problem with publishing a big Christmas pattern series and a year long series like the Blankie is that, while they're a lot of work, people not knitting either of them think I'm not doing anything ... which means the donations to my Fundraising Page drop off. At times like this I try to design a quick pattern to fill the gaps while I carry on working on bigger things (it would help if I didn't keep on designing blankets, I've got three more in the pipeline at the moment).I've just finished one such pattern, Stacking Stars and I feel the need to show it to anybody and everybody so here it is.These are very simple, garter stitch stars which come in nine sizes and can be stacked together to make a rainbow tree. I think this is such a typical Frankie pattern in many ways.First of all, it started with the colours. I love any excuse to play about with lots of bright colours and, since I made my Colour Pegs of Stylecraft Special DK, this has been much easier to do. For this pattern, I had in mind a range of brightly coloured stars in all different sizes so I got my colour pegs out to choose my colours. I thought nine would be enough so I put together two sets of colours, one bright and the other a bit more muted.Then, on the grounds that you can never have too many colours, I re-arranged them into a sequence so that I could use both sets.When I'm arranging colours like this, I very often put them in rainbow order - Richard Of York Gave Battle In Vain (that was fun; I may have to write in colour more often). I love the way Stylecraft Special is labelled by name rather than colour; my chosen colours are, from left to right:Burgundy, Claret, Lipstick, Copper, Gold, Sunshine, Kelly Green (one of my favourites), Green, Bottle, Petrol, Empire, Turquoise, Fuchsia Pink, Boysenberry, Lobelia and Royal. I work with this yarn so often that I'm starting to learn the names off by heart; it's almost like they're my friends ... Oh dear.Anyway, after choosing my colours I had to work out how to knit the stars. This is where I decided to go back to one of my old patterns, Advent Stars.I designed these a couple of years ago to use up yarn left over from my Opal Advent Calendar, after knitting my Patchwork Pelerine. I understand Opal aren't producing a yarn advent calendar this year which is probably just as well for me as I still haven't finished the project I started with the 2016 calendar.So, I took the basic pattern I'd used for the Advent Stars and then worked out how to knit different sizes. This turned out to be really easy, it was just a case of adjusting the number of pattern repeats to suit the number of stitches cast on. This is why I love garter stitch, it makes designing so easy. Right, I thought, knit nine sizes of stars, starting with 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12 stitches. That shouldn't take long.This is where I hit another typical feature of my patterns. They might be colourful and very simple to knit but it takes a surprisingly long time to knit enough of any given pattern to be able to produce a pretty picture. Turns out it takes a very long time to knit 18 stars (plus one for the top of the tree). It didn't help that each star is actually two star shapes sewn together. This makes the shapes more regular as well as giving them a bit of body. So, many days later, I ended up with this ...At this point I got distracted by arranging the stars into pretty patterns. This happens to me a lot when I'm working with lots of colours. There was a lot of this ...Eventually I decided it was about time I turned turn the stars into something. I'd had the idea of a tree in mind from very early on but I couldn't decide how to arrange the stars. Should I stack them so that all the edges matched like this ...... or offset the points to make more of a rosette shape ...... or perhaps something more gradual, like this swirl ...In the end I decided on the first option and set about sewing the stars together through their centres. This was very quick and easy, although I realised half way through that I needed to use the colour of the topmost star, not the bottom one as that would be the one that showed. And guess what I found out once I'd finished? I could still twist the stars once they were joined which meant I could have all three shapes.I'd left the star for the top of the tree until last, planning to sew it down through the two bottom points but then I had a better idea. If I pinned the star to the tree, I could take it off to store the tree, lay it flat on top and pin it down again. That way, it was less likely to get battered when I put it away.I used one of my T shaped blocking pins for this which is just the right length for the job.At this point you'd think I would have finished the actual knitting, wouldn't you? But no, another thing I do a lot is think \"what else could you use this pattern for?\". I managed to talk myself down from knitting some star bunting but I did get distracted by a tree decoration ...... and a tiny tree with stuffed stars and silver beads for decorations ...This one's only about 5 cm or 2\" tall and I have to admit that it was a bit fiddly to knit.So, there you have it, a typical Frankie pattern - lots of colours, simple pattern (but taking ages to knit) and several uses for it. One more thing that strikes me is that it's yet another geometric pattern. I think playing with shapes comes a close second to playing with colour.Rainbow, Accidental Toy, Play Beads and Honeycomb BaubleSee what I mean? Click on the links below the picture for more details on these four patterns. There are lots of geometrics in my blanket patterns too but I think I've wittered on enough for today. Time to get on with some of those unfinished designs I think."},
{"title": "More Frankie's Blankies", "date": "Wednesday 17 October 2018", "text": "Try saying that quickly! The adventure that is Frankie's Blankie continues apace. I'm really pleased that so many people have stuck with this KAL this year. The chat and friendship on my ravelry group is definitely going to be one of my highlights of 2018. So many lovely people, from all round the world, encouraging each other with their knitting and sharing stories from their lives.We're now three quarters of the way through the year which means that the knitters have now finished 36 of their knitted blocks. I continue to be amazed by how different one pattern can look, just with different yarn or colours. I know I've shown pictures from this one before, but look at the difference substituting grey for the stone colour makes.Laurel, from WalesLaurel is calling this one 'Textures of Ice  Cream' which is a great name. I've only just realised that this is her first knitted blanket. Considering it includes 48 different stitch patterns, that's pretty impressive. I have to say, I worried that people wouldn't like so many stitches to try - some of which are quite complicated - but I'm glad to say that they've taken it all in their stride. I tend to avoid making my patterns too complicated but there are obviously lots of knitters out there who relish a challenge.Back to the blankets. Lots of knitters are using this project to get through some of their stash. Barbara is working through her stash of acrylic yarn and, despite all the different colours, I think it works really well as a whole.Barbara, from the USYou will have noticed a lack of sewing up with this one. Barbara is far from being alone in this. A certain laxness about sewing the squares together is a bit of a feature of this KAL. All I can say is, you'll all be sorry when you've got to do them all at the end.Here's another beautiful blanket in progress, using stash yarn.Jackie, from the USIsn't that lovely? You'll notice that Jackie's used different colours for the singe colour blocks too; this is going to be a wonderful scrap blanket. Also - she's sewn the squares together! Melissa is following the colour plan of my original but using shades of Peace Fleece Worsted yarn. I didn't know anything about this company but they look really good. The 'peace' in the name comes from the fact that they use fleece from all round the world to foster mutual understanding and economic interdependence. How about that for a brilliant business model? I see that the worsted yarn comes from Navajo Ramboulliet sheep from the reservation. Melissa, from the USDoesn't this one look fresh and bright? It's going to be a real heirloom when it's finished.Not everyone is going for the multi-coloured look though. Just look what happens when you stick to one colour ...Hilary, from ScotlandBy the way, Hilary lives in the shadow of Ben Nevis which sounds pretty good to me. For those of you in other parts of the world, Ben Nevis is the tallest mountain in the British Isles. Anyway, as you can see, Hilary is using red yarn for all her coloured squares and I think it looks really good. I also feel the need to point out that she only started working on her blanket three months ago and, as well as having caught up, she's SEWN HER SQUARES TOGETHER. Just saying. That red yarn is obviously a bit of a favourite, look at this crochet project I found on Hilary's ravelry project page.As I understand it, this is based on the Wacky Weave Squares pattern by Hilda Steyn, although the centre square is Hilary's own design. This pattern is an example of a technique called Interlocking Crochet which I'd never heard of before but now feel an almost overwhelming desire to try. At once! I may have to get this pattern. Concentrate Frankie, we're talking about knitted blankets here. Right, what haven't I shown you? ah yes, this one ...Monika, from GermanyIsn't this going to be an amazing blanket? Monica is bringing all her different squares together with knitted borders, picking up stitches from the sides of the squares and then casting them off with the three needle cast off. I think that's right anyway. So, no sewing up and a totally unique blanket.This is just a small selection of some of the many beautiful blankets being worked on from my pattern this year. If you're tempted to join in, or start at the beginning in January 2019 perhaps, the patterns are all available free from my Ravlery Shop. All 48 square patterns will have been published by the end of this year, with the patterns for the knitted border and edging to come in January next year.And now I'm off to write up a new (and very colourful) pattern, resisting the urge to try that Interlocking Crochet ... or explore the exciting new origami site I've just found, or get on with my first ever linocut, or weave more squares for my pin loom blanket ..."},
{"title": "Tolkein Treasures", "date": "Friday 5 October 2018", "text": "Earlier this week I finally got to the wonderful Tolkein Maker of Middle-Earth exhibition at The Bodleian. You can't take photographs inside the exhibition so all the pictures here are taken from the book Tolkein Treasures by Catherine McIlwaine, the curator of the exhibition and the Tolkein Archivist at the Bodleian - now there's a job title to conjure with.As someone who has only read The Hobbit and the first book of The Lord of the Rings, I wasn't sure how much I'd appreciate this exhibition but it was really, really good. The captions and interpretive text accompanying the art were well written, detailed and very informative. I learned so much from them and felt that they really captured Tolkien as a man, not just as the author of some of the most popular books in the English language.First and foremost Tolkein was a creator of languages from his early days. As an undergraduate at Exeter College, Oxford he studied Old and Middle English, Old Norse and Medieval Welsh and went on to teach these subjects throughout a long academic career at Oxford. While still a student, he began working on the two Elvish languages that would become Quenya and Sindarin.As time went on, he felt that languages without history and myths were dead things and so he began to create the complex fantasy world from which he took the characters and plots that would become his books. The languages, maps and world came first, the books followed later.You might by now be thinking that Tolkein was something of a solitary man, living in his created middle earth, rather than the real world but the exhibition made clear that this was not the case He was an outgoing, 'clubbable' man with lots of friends and very much involved in his times ... which included the First World War. One of the most moving pictures I saw was that of his matriculation class at Exeter in 1911, with all those who died in the war blacked out. There were very few left, including Tolkein, now standing alone amongst shadows. One college from one University and so many dead.Tolkein took his finals in 1915 before enlisting and was in France in time for the Battle of the Somme the following year.  Invalided home, he was then able to live with his new wife and baby son. This page from his sketchbook shows how special that time was.The story of Tolkein and his wife Edith was beautifully told. They met as orphans in what would now be called their teenage years but were forbidden to meet for three years by Tolkein's guardian who didn't want his school career interrupted. They waited and were married in 1916. Theirs was a happy marriage, lasting more than fifty years.Edith at 17Edith was the inspiration for the Elven princess, Luthien Tinuviel, whose love story with the mortal Beren lies at the heart of The Silmarillion and, when she died in 1971, Tolkein had Luthien's name engraved on her headstone. He deisgned heraldic emblems for both Beren and Luthien, this is one of  the two for Luthien.The couple had four children and Tolkein seems to have been very much a family man. The children weren't banished from his Oxford study as many would have been; indeed, they used to gather there in the evenings for stories. One of those stories was later to become The Hobbit. For many years Tolkein wrote and illustrated letters to his children from Father Christmas in the North Pole, telling of his latest adventures. This is from the first one in 1920.You can now buy a book of these letters, Letter From Father Christmas, which would make a lovely Christmas present. On holiday in Filey in 1925, one of the children lost his toy dog, Rover. To console him, Tolkein told him the story of Roverandom and his adventures, all about a real dog transformed into a toy. This is one of Tolkein's shorter works now available as a lovely, small hardback, complete with his illustrations.The first tale to be published from Tolkein's world was of course The Hobbit which sold out in a few months when it was published in 1937. His friend and fellow Oxford academic C S Lewis said in his review \"Prediction is dangerous: but The Hobbit may well prove a classic\". How right he was.The tale of Bilbo Baggins, the not very brave Hobbit and his quest for treasure in the company of a band of dwarves has become the favourite book of countless children and adults. Some of Tolkein's colour illustrations for the second edition of 'The Hobbit'I first heard of this book when my older brother came home from primary school, full of this wonderful book that his teacher was reading to the class. Our Mum searched it out and we both went on to read and re-read it. Here's my paperback from the 1960s (my brother's is older and tattier, he must have re-read his many times).I particularly loved the map at the start of the book, complete with runes. Why is it that so many of the best children's books have maps as endpapers?Anyway, after the success of this book, Tolkein's publishers were hoping for more Hobbit stories. Instead of which he gave them the story of the Lord of the Rings, told in thee long volumes and not really aimed at children. They published it, no doubt with their fingers firmly crossed, and it went on to be one of the best selling works of fiction ever.This is the first, one volume edition that I remember my brother reading and reading and ... If you're reading this Stephen, get to the exhibition!I haven't really talked about the maps of middle earth, of which there were many wonderful examples at the exhibition. Here's the first map of The Shire from 1938 with the Brandywine River running through the middle.There were so many different types if art to see. This drawing, called 'The Tree of Amalion' has many different leaves and flowers growing together; I think it would make a beautiful embroidery.I'll leave you with Tolkein's illustration of one of my favourite parts of 'The Hobbit', when Bilbo (protected by the invisibility the ring gives him) talks to Smaug the dragon. The exhibition continues until the 28th of this month; do go and see it. Tickets are free but must be booked in advance to stop it getting too crowded."},
{"title": "Pretty Buttons", "date": "Tuesday 25 September 2018", "text": "I love coming across pretty buttons to add to my collection and I've found a wonderful online shop that sells all sorts of little treasures. The Vintage Button Emporium has buttons in all sizes and materials, ranging from cheap packs of craft buttons up to very special silver or enamel Victorian buttons. For my first order I restricted myself to cheaper buttons; I had a lovely time browsing through the site, adding a button to my basket every now and then.My buttons arrived quickly and look how nicely packaged they were.I do like a pretty package with real ribbon. Here are the buttons I chose ...... a mixture of glass, metal and plastic buttons. That one in the middle looks just like a mint humbug, doesn't it? The multi-coloured dotty one at the bottom reminded me a bit of my favourite button in my Mum's button box as a child. It was quite chunky but had a pattern a bit like this one. Speaking of my Mum's button box, would you like to see it?It's quite small and was originally a sweet tin. Inside the lid it says 'George W Horner & Co. Ltd. Maker of Good Sweets, Chester-Le-Street, County of Durham, England'. So now you know. Mum's buttons have long since gone and I keep my old boot button style buttons in it.You may remember me telling you about starting a Charmstring of special buttons a while ago. Well, some of my new buttons have been added to this. There are about twenty on my string so far so I've got a way to go if I'm going to reach 1,000.I'm putting metal buttons on my charmstring but am thinking about starting another one with brightly coloured plastic buttons. Or maybe glass and mother of pearl (I've got a lot of mother of pearl buttons). Does anyone else out there collect old buttons like these? I made button cushions for my children when they were small with animal buttons and brightly coloured shaped ones (and yes, I sewed them on really tightly). I wonder if I should make myself a grown-up version with some of my treasures."},
{"title": "Astley Book Farm", "date": "Monday 17 September 2018", "text": "Ever since Penn bookshop closed earlier this year (you can read about it here), we've been on a mission to find a replacement. So far we've got Wolverton Books (very cheap) and a good, mixed secondhand shop in Wantage. Of course, I am lucky to have one of the best secondhand bookshops ever just down the road, in the shape of Books & Ink. By the way, Sam at Books & Ink is happy to put books in the post so, if you're looking for something in particular, do give her a ring.But, when it comes to books, more is always better, right? So, on Friday my son and I set off to visit another new-to-us secondhand bookshop that looked promising. Astley Book Farm is North-East of Coventry,  just over an hour's drive from here. You go in through this modest little blue door ...That sign reads 'Unattended children will be givenan espresso and a free puppy'... to find yourself in a huge maze of a shop.Room after room, full of books on every conceivable subject and all housed in a barn - or maybe it's a series of barns. There are chairs dotted around so that you can browse the books in comfort and there's even a stove in one room.The fiction alone extends through several rooms. Everything is alphabetically ordered and the stock is good. I always think the test of a secondhand bookshop is the children's section. All too often, this is just a random collection of any books aimed at children. Not the case here, I'm glad to say. The children's books are housed in the hayloft and have obviously been selected well. We know quite a bit about children's literature and found lots of interesting titles that we hadn't seen before. The fiction is stronger than the picture books but all the sections are good. There's also a bookcase of older (as in collectable) children's books by the main desk.We were pleased to see that the shop also stocks all the Persephone Books which I don't think I've seen anywhere other than at the Persephone shop in London. In the courtyard there's a small barn of random, cheaply priced stock. For those too young to remember 'old money', ten bob is ten shillings or 50p in new money.And, last but not least, there's even a cafe. We had a very nice broccoli and stilton soup but the cakes looked wonderful too. I think we'll have to sample those on a future visit. I loved this display of Puffin book covers on the front of the counter.So, what did I buy in this exciting shop? Mostly children's books of course. I got twelve new Puffin Firsts which is a lot to find in one go.I was particularly pleased with these two.I'm a big fan of Barbara Willard's historical fiction, in particular her Mantlemass Chronicles, a series of books following the lives of two families from the 15th to 17th century. So, I was pleased to find 'The Penny Pony' about two children who want a real pony but can only afford an old model of one from a junk shop - sounds like a promising start to a story. The cover is illustrated by Juliet Palmer and I think it's particularly attractive. A lot of thought went into choosing artists to illustrate the Puffin Story Books.'Mademoiselle' is set in Paris in the Summer of 1914 which would be enough to make me want to read it but it's also by Geraldine Symons who wrote 'The Workhouse Child' which I read and loved as a child. On getting it home I realised that 'Mademoiselle' is a sequel to that book, albeit with another book in between. Now I need to find a copy of 'Miss Rivers and Miss Bridges' to fill that gap. Not all the Puffins were fiction. I found these two history books, both written by James Barbary.They look interesting; there was another one about the English Civil War but my son got that one. I wonder if Barbary wrote any others.I do love a good poetry anthology so I was pleased to find this Puffin collection from 1976.Which leads nicely on to my special find of the day, another poetry anthology.This is a lovely book, originally published in 1957. What attracted me though was the name of the compiler. Pamela Whitlock was just 15 when she and her friend Katherine Hull decided to write a book. They wrote alternate chapters and then swapped them to edit each other's work. When the book was finished they sent it off to their favourite author Arthur Ransome. This is where the story gets really exciting as Ransome loved the book, persuaded his publishers to publish it and even wrote the foreword. 'The Far-Distant Oxus' was set on Exmoor, as were the two sequels 'Escape to Persia' and 'Oxus in Summer'. The first of the books was re-published some years ago by Fidra Books which is how we discovered it but, sadly, all three are now out of print.Anyway, back to the poetry. As well as poems chosen by Pamela Whitlock, there are also a few beautiful woodcuts by Joan Hassall. One of the great twentieth century exponents of wood engraving, any book with Joan Hassall illustrations is a great find.I did buy a few picture books too. These three hardbacks each cost only a few pounds.The most interesting one is perhaps that one in the middle.'Kindle Me A Riddle' by Roberta Karim is the story of a Pioneer family in mid nineteenth century Utah. Each page features something from the family's life and the riddle of where it came from. So, for example, Constance's winter cloak was once the winter cloak of the sheep.The oil paintings throughout the book are by Bethanne Andersen. I'm not sure if this book was ever published in the UK; the one I found is an American edition from Greenwillow Books who are part of Harper Collins.This picture book is much smaller and also much older.'The Tale of Noah and the Flood' by Clark Hutton is number 54 in the Puffin picture book series and was published in 1946. I have quite a big collection of old Puffin Picture books so I was glad to be able to add a new one to the pile. There are several stunning double page illustrations in this one It also ends with these words (in block capitals) 'Noah lived another 350 years after the flood cultivating vineyards and when he died he was nine hundred and fifty years old'. Mmm, not too sure about that. One day I must write a blog post about this series of books.I just want to show you one more book that I bought at Astley, an addition to my collection of Puffin Annuals.'Puffin's Pleasure' was published in 1976 and is a compilation of stories, articles and activities by some of the great names in children's literature. You only have to open the book and look at the endpapers to know you're in for a treat.How about a story by Ursula Le Guin?Or perhaps an illustrated poem by Joan Aiken? This one's about a cat with a crooked tail.Then there's an article about life on a canal narrowboat, written by Jill Paton Walsh.My two other Puffin Annuals are from 1974 and 1975. I don't know if there any others but, if there are, I want them!I think the annuals were an offshoot from The Puffin Club which ran from 1967 to 1989. If anyone knows any more about these annuals, I'd love to hear from you."},
{"title": "More Starts Than Finishes", "date": "Monday 10 September 2018", "text": "Well, I don't know ... despite the fact that I'm currently working on too many projects too count - at least five blankets, the big Christmas pattern for later this year, you get the general idea - I've still managed to start several new things recently. But, first, here's one thing I've managed to finish.This is my Snowball Quilt and I'm quite pleased with it. There are more than a few pencil lines still visible from quilting that border but they'll come out in the wash. I can't be bothered to wash it now so I'll wait until I spill tea on it; knowing me, that won't be long.Of course, finishing one small quilt meant that I had to start on another one straight away. So I spent a lovely evening cutting out all the pieces for this one.This is the first quilt I'm making from Kathleen Tracy's latest book A Prairie Journey. Those pieces looked very small to me so I was a bit worried about piecing them accurately. I needn't have worried though. With this pattern, there are no points to match so it goes together pretty easily.I started by laying out the pieces for the first few rows on one of my little quilt design boards. I made a set of these a while ago by following Lori Holt's Mini Design Board Tutorial. The wadding on the top of the boards holds the pieces and you can stack the boards together to keep all the pieces safe until you're ready to sew them together.For the piecing, I like to use my little Singer Featherweight sewing machine which I bought in an antique shop a few years ago. It's 66 years old, half the size of a 'normal' machine and sews like a dream.I seem to get a more accurate quarter of an inch seam with the Featherweight. I did read somewhere that, because it doesn't do zigzag stitches, it sews a straighter seam but I don't know if that's right. Do you like the patchwork mat the machine's sitting on? That's another Lori Holt pattern, this time from her book Quilty Fun. There are little pockets at the front to hold sewing tools and the mat doubles up as a cover when I put the machine away.While we're talking about making stuff for the sewing room (or in my case the scullery), here's my little ironing station.The ironing board is a small bread board covered with heat reflective wadding and fabric and backed with felt. I can't remember where I found the tutorial to make this but there are various ones online. The iron is a travel iron, just the right size for the mini board.If you make bigger quilts than me, you might like to make a slightly bigger ironing board by covering one of those small folding tables you can buy from various places. I got mine at  Dunelm Mill and it's the table the Featherweight sits on when I sew.Anyway ... after several sewing sessions I now have half of my quilt top finished.Can you see where I put two pieces of the same fabric next to each other? I try to avoid that but, as they say, it'll never be seen from a galloping horse (although why they should say that I don't know).When it comes to knitting, I did manage to finish my Patchwork Purse pattern but that's about it.There's a lot to be said for small things that can be knitted and written up quickly. Mind you, I then found myself unable to resist turning the same shapes into a patchwork blanket pattern. Yes, I know, another blanket.This is the only block I've knitted so far but I did spend quite a long time trying to find a variegated yarn with the right colour lengths. They were either too short, making all the shapes look the same, or too long which gave me solid coloured shapes. Finally, I found Hayfield Bonus Breeze which is just right. This colour is called Embers and I bought it at my brand new branch of Hobbycraft. In the last year I've acquired a Waitrose and a Hobbycraft, both within walking distance. My cup brimmeth over.Then, one evening last week, I had an irresistible urge to do some crochet (as you do) but it had to be something new (of course it did). So I fished out some of the leftover yarn from my Helicopter blanket and started making a quick cowl.I'm going to edge it a variegated black yarn and then I think I'll make a quick pair of cuffs to match. The crochet is very simple so I think they can go in one pattern together.I also bought some more sock yarn when I went to Bourton-on-the-Water last week. There's a very nice little yarn and needlework shop there called The Bourton Basket and they had a good selection.The two on the left are going to be Christmas socks for my son and my daughter's partner. As you can see, one is happier with bright colours than the other. The one on the right is for me but I think I might use it for some exciting pin loom weaving that I've got planned. More of that soon.As if all this wasn't enough, I'm still working hard on my new Ten Stitch. I haven't got at all fed up with it yet which has got to be a first and I can't wait to be able to share it with everyone. I know that it will look better if it's really big though so you'll have to be patient while I keep knitting.I still don't feel comfortable choosing the colours as I go along. I'm definitely a planner when it comes to colours (and most things, actually) but I decided it would be good for me to try something new. I think it's working although I can't help thinking of lots of exciting ways you could plan the colours for this one."},
{"title": "Bourton-on-the-Water", "date": "Wednesday 5 September 2018", "text": "In my part of the world, place names with lots of hyphens are pretty common. Driving to Bourton-on-the-Water yesterday, I went through both Moreton-in-Marsh and Stow-on-the-Wold. It's not difficult to see where Bourton got its name ...The river Windrush flows through the centre of the town and is crossed by little footbridges. It's a clear, shallow river and ideal for paddling. Naturally enough, it's a popular tourist spot and every other building seems to be a tea room or gift shop (or sometimes both).My son and I were there to re-visit a couple of places we remember going to nearly twenty years ago when he and his sister were small. First of all, a maze with a difference.As well as finding your way to the centre of The Dragonfly Maze, you also have to collect clues from numbered rebus stones along the way. This is trickier than it sounds, it took us quite a while to find them all and then a bit longer to make sense of them. Every time we came to a junction in the maze, we took it in turns to choose which way to go. I kept taking us down the same paths - I have no sense of direction at all.Finally, we arrived in the centre of the maze to find the treasure hidden in this building.I shan't show you what was inside but it was lovely and yes, there was a dragonfly.After the maze, we walked down the road to Birdland, a beautifully landscaped park with over 100 different bird species to see. There were King Penguins (smaller than Emperors, in case you wondering) ...... Pelicans ...... and this very friendly bird whose name I've forgotten ...I was very taken by some Weaver Birds, tiny little yellow birds who were busy weaving rushes into round nests.Part of the park is a woodland nature reserve where you might spot a kingfisher or an otter ... or something a bit older ...Well, dinosaurs are related to birds after all. We had our picnic next to this tortoise who was taking his lunchtime constitutional. Here's a shot of him in action. Now there's a prehistoric looking animal.We thoroughly enjoyed our day and I got a bit more practice with my new camera. It keeps cropping thins without my permission but, apart from that, I'm getting the hang of it. At least knitting tends to stay in one place when you're taking its picture."},
{"title": "Bramble Patch", "date": "Friday 31 August 2018", "text": "Last week I had a trip to Bramble Patch, my local Quilt shop, which is in the village of Weedon Bec in Northamptonshire. I've been visiting this lovely shop for years and there's always something interesting to see. This time, it was the Summer Showcase, featuring quilts made from their various clubs.Gypsy Wife QuiltsTake a Bow Mystery Club QuiltsI was very taken with these little rainbow quilts as I only make small quilts (although mine are bigger than these).I was also pleased to see this quilt kit, inspired by Lucy Boston's Keyboard Quilt. Lucy Boston is the author of the wonderful Green Knowe books; you can read more about her in my post from last year here.This next quilt is called Interlocking Triads. Bramble Patch will be running workshops on this one in the coming months. I love the colours and shapes in this one - very much my sort of thing.After seeing the exhibition I had a wander round the shop. I had a £20 fabric voucher to spend, courtesy of my loyalty card so was looking for something special.I'm always very taken by the Batik section - aren't all those rich colours gorgeous?And there were several more Lucy Boston kits to admire. This Kaleidoscope Cushion Kit uses Liberty prints from the new Liberty patchwork cotton collection.But I was drawn, as I often am, to the Moda charm packs where you get 42 5\" squares from a fabric collection. I love using reproduction fabrics so these are the two packs I chose.The one on the left is 'New Hope' by Jo Morton, author of one of my favourite quilt books Jo's Little Favorites. There are two more volumes of this book but I've so far resisted the temptation to buy them too. Anyway ... the second charm pack is called 'Evelyn's Homestead 1880 - 1900' by Betsey Chutchian. Would you like to see all the fabrics? Of course you would.Jo MortonBetsey ChutchianAren't they beautiful? I think the two packs go together well; I'm planning to use them to make some quilts from my new book by Kathleen Tracy that I bought at the Festival of Quilts. First though, I've got to finish quilting this one ...This is my little Snowball quilt that I hand pieced ages ago and then put away when the quilting wasn't going well. I always hand quilt but, this time, my quilting left a lot to be desired - lumps and bumps all over the place. When this happens the answer is always more quilting; in this case I added the little quilted squares in the middle of the blocks and now it's starting to look quite nice. As you can see, I've just got to finish quilting the border and bind it and it will be done. Then I can start a new quilt ..."},
{"title": "Festival of Quilts", "date": "Tuesday 14 August 2018", "text": "I had a lovely day at the Quilt Show last week. As ever, there wasn't really enough time in one day to see all the quilts and the trading stands. One year I'm going to go for two days. I thought the quality of the stands was much better this year - there were some really interesting things on sale - and (very important this) there was more seating than in previous years.The highlight of the day for me was seeing 1718 Coverlet.This was bought by the Quilters' Guild in 2000 and is the earliest British dated patchwork. It's called a coverlet because it wasn't quilted. All the blocks were pieced over paper and these papers are still in place, giving more information about how the maker worked. She folded paper to make the shapes and then cut along the folds. There are also balance marks that she made to help her line up the shapes.Some of the blocks are pieced shapes that we still use today, many others are figurative and feature animals, flowers and even people dressed in the clothes of the time.A modern quilter would probably use applique to make these sort of blocks but they were still worked over paper in the original. One block bears the initials EH and the date 1718 but no more has been discovered about EH, whoever she was.There was something of a craze for patchwork in the early 18th Century among affluent women. You would need to be rich enough to be able to 'waste' fabric like this and also to have access to sufficient paper at a time when paper was still very costly. The Quilter's Guild made a reproduction of the coverlet and decided to use the bright colours of the original, traces of which can be seen in seam allowances. Although the coverlet is still surprisingly colourful, it would have been much brighter when new.That's the original on the left and the replica next to it.Most of the fabrics used were silks which would have been of a much higher thread count in 1718 than now. Modern silks are very hard to work with as they tend to fray easily. We tend to assume that we have much higher quality materials to use in our crafts now than in the past but that's not always the case.Due to its fragile condition, the coverlet has to be kept in the dark and only exhibited rarely so I was very lucky to have got the chance to see such a special piece of quilting history. I bought this book to learn more about the coverlet and I'm very pleased with it.As well as lots of information about the coverlet and the work that went into reproducing it, the book also has photos of each of the blocks with information on how to make them, either using the original technique or modern methods.Would you like to see the other things I bought at the show? Obviously I had to buy some fabric and I chose these two lengths of hand-dyed cotton.I'm using these to make Quilt As You Go Hexagons which are basically tiny mini quilts. I'll show you what I mean when I've started putting them together. So far, I've just cut out all the pieces with the help of my trusty Sizzix Big Shot die cutting machine. The Sizzix was a purchase at the same show a few years ago - I was very pleased I had my daughter with me to carry it!I always buy something from Sue Hawkins; her kits are lovely and lots of fun to make. I do tend to go for the same colourway, as you can see ... ... a needlebook, two scissor keepers and a bookmark. Those lovely scissors were bought from Sue too. So, I thought I'd be daring this year and try a different colour scheme.I was feeling very smug about trying new colours until Sue pointed out that these pastels are just paler shades of my favourites.Ah yes, I see what you mean Sue. That's the thread from the new kit on the right.I bought another book too. By the way, the best place for patchwork and quilting books is Kaleidoscope. They're the stall that's always packed with people at shows but they have a good website too and ship worldwide. My new book is the latest from Kathleen Tracy, one of my favourite authors. I have quite a collection of her books.What I like about them is the blend of history and straightforward quilt projects. All the quilts are small and everything is beautifully photographed. The new book is called A Prairie Journey and is just as lovely as the others.I'd like to make every single quilt in this book. Look at this blue log cabin with the big squares in the middle ...... or how about a Wagon Wheel quilt? I really love the colours in this one.If you'd like to see more of Kathleen's work, I can highly recommend her blog A Sentimental Quilter. She writes very interesting posts and is good at practical advice on choosing fabric and planning a project. She's also making her own Dear Jane quilt. Now there's another wonderful historical quilt ..."},
{"title": "On My Needles", "date": "Sunday 5 August 2018", "text": "At any one time I have about a dozen design projects in progress. Some will be at the pencil and paper stage but most are 'on my needles', even if I haven't worked on them for a while. I thought you might like a look at the things I'm flitting between at the moment.This is my Mini Marshmallow crochet blanket. It's lovely but rather heavy to be working on during a heatwave. Also ... why do I have to turn everything into a blanket? At the start of a project when I'm full of enthusiasm, I always think \"Yes! Blanket!\" then, at about this stage, I realise just how long it's going to take me to make something big enough to qualify as a blanket. This is when I start thinking \"A bag would have been just as nice\".I think I might use this stitch again to make a shoulder bag one day. It would be an opportunity to try a different colour scheme too (I'm loving my Stylecraft yarn pegs - can you tell?) I'd also like to see if I can work out a circular version of this stitch and use it to make a round cushion, perhaps in pastel colours. I don't use pastels enough and they're nice colours too.Speaking of pastel shades, look at the colours I've used here ...These shapes are waiting to be turned into two little purses, inspired by an Origami design. I was looking at these this morning and thought it would be nice to knit a patchwork blanket using these shapes. I know - another blanket. These are in moss stitch but I think I'd do the blanket in garter stitch. I'm wondering about using a variegated yarn and a few co-ordinating plain colours - maybe from the Stylecraft Batik range. I could use one of the Batik Elements for the variegated yarn.Here's another blanket I'm working on at the moment and this one isn't making me wish I hadn't started it.This is going to be my 'Secret Garden' baby blanket and I'm absolutely loving it. Each square takes quite a while to knit but the knitting is interesting and varied. I think of this as an heirloom project; something to be worked on in unhurried times so that the knitting process is as beautiful as the finished blanket. It's not going to be very big - this is one third of the blocks - and then there will be a border. At the moment the blocks are all wavy and irregular but that will be sorted out by the final blocking.I've still only done three of my watermelon coloured log cabin blocks but, luckily, these are in fact going to be a bag so I only need to do twelve all together.When I've knitted a few more of these I shall be able to play around with arranging them. Do I put them all the same way up or put all the red edges together, or something different?The next thing is off, rather than on my needles. After working on my Tunisian Crochet waistcoat for a while, I've realised that the bottom is wider than the top.So ... I've either got to start again and make that grey band narrower or work the main part on a bigger hook (which I don't have). I think I need to fish out my original plan to see which measurement is right and then go from there.The last two 'on my needles' projects are secrets so I can only show  you bits of them now. The first one is the big Christmas pattern for this year.I have spent months cutting lots of bits of plastic canvas and then covering them with knitting. This is very boring work and I'm at that stage when I'm wondering if anyone else will want to knit this. The designing has got a little bit more interesting in the last week or so but still ... One of the worst things about these big patterns is that I have to make them (and take photographs) without any clear idea of how many individual patterns there will be and what order I shall publish them in. This means I can't do much construction until near the end, so I have no idea of how well the whole thing is going to work. I shall just have to plod on and keep my fingers crossed.The other secret project is my latest Ten Stitch pattern. It's so exciting to have worked out a new variation and this one is such fun to knit. There's just enough variation to stop it becoming boring and I'm absolutely loving it. Really, I would be happy just knitting this and reading all day.I can't wait to be able to share this one but there's quite a way to go yet so back to the knitting ..."},
{"title": "Edgehill", "date": "Wednesday 1 August 2018", "text": "What comes to mind when you hear the name Edgehill? If you're English it may well make you think of the first battle of the English Civil War, fought in October 1642. Often considered to be something of a shambles which ended in stalemate, the Battle of Edgehill actually gave the Royalists something of an advantage as the Parliamentary forces retreated to Warwick, leaving the way to London open.The battle took place in open fields around the villages of Kineton and Radway but much of it is inaccessible to the public now as it's owned by the Ministry of Defence. Appropriately enough, there is a huge MOD Ammunition Depot on part of the site.You can, however, still look out over what would have been the battlefield from this spot ...... but I'm getting ahead of myself here. This was the place I was aiming for on my walk, taking in quite a few steps, a wood and some open countryside on the way.I started at Upton House, a National Trust property near the top of Sun Rising Hill (more about that later) and headed off across the fields towards the village of Ratley. This Summer's heatwave has left our green and pleasant land looking dry and brown.It was a hot and tiring walk across hilly fields before I could even spot Ratley in the distance.I walked up through the village (yes, another hill), heading for the woods that line the top of Edge Hill.You get down into the woods by several flights of steps which are known as Jacob's Ladder.It was cooler amongst the trees and I enjoyed plodding along the path that runs along the top of the hill.About half way, I made a slight diversion to show you this ...... not a Castle, but a pub. This is the Castle, said to be built on the site where King Charles surveyed the land on the evening before the battle.After quite a lot more walking, I finally emerged from the trees at the top of Sun Rising Hill. This is the spot where the road goes down the hill; it's very steep and twisty, quite challenging for drivers. I once got behind a dustbin lorry coming up Sun Rising - that was fun.The weather can be very different at the top of the hill to the bottom. I've driven from snow into sunshine and there can be thick fog at the top and none in the valley.There was still quite a bit more walking to do before I finally emerged into the clear space on the ridge of the hill. This is the view I had been aiming for.And there was a breeze at last! I sat down, took my boots off to cool my feet down and got out the picnic. I come from a family of serious picnickers and take a flask of tea with me whenever possible. I really enjoyed sitting at the top of the hill, gazing out across the country and eating my well-earned lunch.Can you see the field with the dark patch in it, about halfway up the picture on the right? That was being harvested; by the time I'd finished my picnic it had all been cut. I love this place - the view is always amazing and its history makes its special too.I'll leave you with a picture of one of my favourite wild flowers, taken earlier on the walk. This is Rosebay Willowherb. Isn't that the most wonderful name?"},
{"title": "Colour Planning", "date": "Sunday 15 July 2018", "text": "I love designing really colourful patterns but, when it comes to choosing colours, I do have a tendency to get stuck in the 'rainbow rut'.See what I mean? It's just so easy to use the shades of the rainbow for a bright result that's always popular. These patterns are Colour Wheel Shawl, Tiddlywinks Blanket, Paddle Ball and Rainbow by the way (although I think I can be forgiven for using rainbow colours to knit an actual rainbow).Anyway, last week I accidentally designed a new Ten Stitch pattern. It was accidental in that I was just doodling on some graph paper and an idea suddenly clicked into place. Apart from a bit of fiddling about while I worked out exactly where to place the shaping stitches, it came together pretty quickly. So, I've knitted a small test piece and am now ready to start on the actual blanket - yes, it's a blanket. This one is slightly different from the others in that it's not worked continuously but in 'rounds', using a different colour for each round. I say rounds but it's not actually a circle or anything remotely resembling one. I thought this would be a good opportunity to use lots of different colours as I know many people use the Ten Stitch patterns as stashbuster projects. So I turned out my baskets of Stylecraft Special DK ... which is when it started to get complicated. With so many colours (now all over the floor), where should I start? So, I put them all back in their baskets and did something else.What I did was to crochet a couple of little mats to see if I could be a bit more relaxed when choosing colours ...... apparently not. Exactly the same colours in both of them! At this point I gave up and went to bed.The next morning it dawned on me that what I needed were yarn pegs for all the Stylecraft Special colours to do my colour planning with. Not only would this save me being overwhelmed by balls of yarn all over the floor but it also offered the prospect of many happy hours procrastinating as I wound the pegs. The first problem was that I don't have all the 80 solid shades of this yarn. What to do? Obviously I went straight to Wool Warehouse to order the 26 colours I needed to complete the set. I know, that's a big order, but I justified it by remembering how much I use this yarn in my designs.Having done that, I set about making yarn pegs with the 54 colours I already had.Don't they look nice? The trickiest part was writing the colour names on the pegs. I deliberately covered a wide section of each peg with yarn to give me a nice big band of colour which then meant I had to write very small using a fine drawing pen.My yarn order arrived from Wool Warehouse the next day in a big box - I've never ordered so much from them that they had to put it in a box before. Yet again I have to say how impressed I am  by their speedy service; their yarn elves must be super quick workers. When I unpacked the yarn I could see why these were the colours I'd never used before.They're either a bit dull or, well, neon. When it came to wrapping them round their pegs though I got to like them a bit better. I suspect that some of these not-so-exciting shades might be just the thing I need to bring a colour scheme to life. Spending time making the pegs like this is also a good way to absorb some of the colours, if that makes any kind of sense.And here they are - 80 shades of Stylecraft Special DK in their own little suitcase ...Of course, I immediately started playing with them, lining them up ...... fanning them out ...... and then seeing how many different groups of colours I could put together.I'm resisting the temptation to pick all the colours for the new Ten Stitch blanket in advance (relax, Frankie) and am, instead, going to start with just one colour I like and then choose the others as I finish each round. How scary is that? (No Frankie, not scary, exciting).Now all I've got to do is decide on that first colour. You're not in a hurry for this pattern are you?"},
{"title": "In Search of Badby Wood", "date": "Saturday 7 July 2018", "text": "On Tuesday I packed a picnic and set off to explore some local woods that I've never actually been to before. Badby Wood is near Daventry in Northamptonshire and is best known for its displays of bluebells in the Spring. There are also badgers to be seen if you go late in the day and are prepared to wait patiently.I decided to park outside the village and walk across the fields to the woods from a handy lay-by on the main road. There was a gentle breeze as I set off across this barley field so the walking was quite comfortable.Is that the wood I see ahead?It was but there were a few obstacles to deal with first. Like this overgrown stile ...should have taken my secateurs with me... and more than one section of path swamped with ferns as tall as me ...It was a case of arms above your head (in case of nettles) and feel the way with your feet. Every stream I saw was dried up like this one ...But finally I reached the trees.I'd like to say that it was cool and shady in the wood. Shady, yes but it was also really close and the air was full of thunder flies. I was quite pleased with myself though as I managed to find my way through the wood to the high point in the centre which is called Hazeley Knob.Oak TreeIt is a beautiful wood though and I shall come back when the weather isn't quite so challenging. There were lots of trees down which gave me some extra exercise climbing over them but they're also handy when you want to sit down for a rest.I walked back to the car along a slightly different path so that I could see this ...This is a small earthworks known as Badby Grange which dates back to the 13th century. As you can see, it's completely overgrown now but, if you venture inside, you can still see its shape.After walking in the heat I was glad to get back to my air-conditioned car. I called in at Banbury Antiques on the way home for a pot of tea and came away with this lovely little collection of old buttons ...I'll add these to my rainbow button jars."},
{"title": "Half a Blankie", "date": "Friday 6 July 2018", "text": "We're now halfway through knitting Frankie's Blankie on my Frankie's Knitted Stuff ravelry group and the blankets are getting quite big now. Well, those that are sewn together are anyway. The sewing up fairy still seems to be a bit slow at getting round to everyone so there are quite a few piles of knitted blocks awaiting her attention.Anyway, I thought it would be nice to share some of the different blankets that people are knitting from the same pattern. Let's start with one using the same yarns that I chose.Pat, from the United StatesDoesn't that look good? And there are as many blocks again to be added yet, each one with a different stitch pattern. By the end of this year the blanketeers will all be expert knitters.Of course, lots of people are using different yarns for their blankets and it's lovely seeing how they all turn out. This one is knitted with yarns from Bendigo Woollen Mills and, as you can see, Dora has chosen a range of colours inspired by water.Dora, from AustraliaI think this is going to be a very sophisticated looking blanket once it's finished.Something as simple as just changing the main colour can make a huge difference. Erika has chosen a dark grey to set off the colours in her blocks and don't they look great?Erika, from EnglandErika only started knitting her blanket recently and she's already caught up. I like the effect she's got by crocheting her blocks together too.This next one uses Patons Merino DK with a dark brown as the main colour.Jill, from EnglandAgain, this looks to me like it's going to be a very grown-up blanket. Why do darker colours seem more sophisticated to me I wonder? This picture makes me want to knit something with brown, pink and green ...Instead of using one set of colours for the whole blanket, Lida is choosing a colour theme for each month which I think is a brilliant idea. Here are her squares for April ...Lida, from the Netherlands... and May ...I don't know much about this next blanket (other than it looks great) as the picture was sent to me by Marianne who translates my patterns into Danish.Bente, from DenmarkThe slip stitch patterns stand out really well when only one contrast colour is used, don't they?Last, but definitely not least, is Jackie's blanket. She's using up stash yarn, some of which has come from her 91 year old mother who no longer knits.Jackie, from the United StatesI think the nicest thing about this blanket is that Jackie's mother is enjoying seeing its progress and talking about the different stitch patterns with her. Knitting at its best.The last of the 50 block patterns will be published just before Christmas but, just in case everyone thinks they'll be finished by then, I'd like to remind you that there will be two more patterns in January 2019, for a plain knitted border and then a colourful edging. And be warned - that edging takes forever to knit!"},
{"title": "More Pretty Books", "date": "Monday 2 July 2018", "text": "Oh yes, I've been buying secondhand books again. This time from The Shakespeare Hospice Charity Bookshop. My son and I were in Stratford on Saturday for one of our regular theatre visits - Miss Littlewood since you ask and yes, it was very good thank-you. Anyway, we varied our normal bookshop trawl to include this shop  where I found this lovely book.This is one of a series of nostalgic Scrapbooks compiled by Robert Opie; I've already got a couple of the others. They're huge books and each page is packed with things from his vast collection of consumer memorabilia. Here's the page on Women's magazines of the 1920s ...Look at those lovely copies of Weldon's.Or how about this page of toys ...Those rather sinister looking toys in the middle are characters from the Winnie-The-Pooh books.There's something to appeal to everyone in these books, whether it be trains (yes Stephen, this picture's for you) ...... or just lots of lovely old adverts ...There are ten of these giant scrapbooks all together, covering much of the twentieth century and they're all beautiful. You can buy them new from Robert Opie's Museum of Brands which, by the way, is a great little museum. I thoroughly enjoyed visiting it a few years ago; it's absoulutely crammed full of memories.The other book I bought at this shop isn't quite so pretty but it'll be very useful.I bought The Quilter's Bible by Linda Clements for my daughter a few years ago and thought at the time what a comprehensive book it was for a new quilter. Now I've been quilting for a while but I mostly learned from my Mum so I was pleased to find a copy of this book for myself.It's full of detailed information on just about every technique you could think of and has lots of inspiring pictures too. I love the section on creating the illusion of curves with straight lines.I've made a Storm At Sea quilt (the purple design at the bottom) but my Snail Trail quilt  - that's the main picture - is languishing in a bag half-finished. I love pages like this one that show lots of designs from just a few simple shapes ...You could turn any one of these into a knitted or crocheted blanket.After the charity bookshop, we still had time to pop into the Chaucer Head Bookshop, where I found this treasure ...This may well have been the prettiest book in the shop ... well I thought so anyway. It's 'A Medieval Miscellany' by Judith Herrin and is a collection of medieval texts and images, translated into modern English.'A Shepherd's Duty' and 'Magic''Pilgrimage' and 'Travel'As well as being beautiful, the book is a wonderful history of daily life many hundreds of years ago. I love this sort of book - history and art combined. What more could you want?"},
{"title": "It's all about the colours", "date": "Sunday 1 July 2018", "text": "Sometimes I feel the need to start another project just because nothing on my needles is colourful enough. This happened to me a couple of days ago so I went in search of a big, dramatic crochet stitch that I could work in bold stripes of colour. This is what I came up with ...How about that for some serious texture? This is my version of the marshmallow stitch and I'm using a rainbow of Patons Diploma Gold DK for it. Of course this sort of stitch just eats yarn so I shall have to order some more soon. I'm hoping that three balls of each colour plus some sort of edging will make a small blanket.I've also started using this Catona Colour Pack that I showed you the other week. You get one little 10g ball of each of the 109 shades of Catona in the pack and, after playing with them for a while, I decided it was time to actually start using them.I'm going to knit straightforward squares and then sew them together to make a blanket. Deciding on how to arrange them is going to be exciting. I'll probably only do 100 squares so that I can make a 10 x 10 blanket but just think of all the possible ways of arranging 100 colours. I'm seriously considering taking a photograph of each square so that I can create pictures of different ways of putting them together ...... but I'm getting ahead of myself here. So far I've knitted one green square. It's a very pretty square though.As you can see, I've also crocheted a tiny square and made a yarn peg to use in planning designs. Just another 99 to go then."},
{"title": "Handicraft Medal", "date": "Monday 25 June 2018", "text": "I'm wondering if anyone can tell me something about this ...I bought it a few years ago from an antique stall in Burford. The person I bought it from had got it from a dealer who found it in a collection of military medals. It had been kept with the husband's medals but the dealer didn't want it. I thought that was rather sad.Anyway, as you can see, it's a medal for Handicrafts awarded by Woman's Own magazine. The front shows a scantily dressed woman proudly displaying what looks like fabric, made up of strips of different designs. Personally, I think she'd be better off making it into something warm to wear but there you go. The back has a garland border with space to have a name engraved.There's no name on this medal but luckily it came in its original box which has a name pencilled on the back.Without any more information I've been unable to find anything out about Mrs F M Webb or indeed  about these medals and when they were awarded. I wonder what she did to win hers.If anyone knows anything about the Woman's Own Handicraft medals (or indeed Mrs Webb who may or may not have lived in the Cotswolds) then do let me know by leaving a comment below."},
{"title": "Starts and Finishes", "date": "Tuesday 19 June 2018", "text": "I love starting work on new designs and, after my recent trip to Wool Warehouse, I've got the yarn I need to get on with a couple of ideas that I thought of a while ago. First of all, can you guess what this is going to be?Obviously, this is a pencil case in progress - how could you not guess that at once? I knew the colours I wanted to use but spent hours trying out different stitch patterns to get one I liked. And what did I end up with? Garter stitch. Not that I don't love garter stitch but you'd think I would have thought of that first. The coloured stripes are the clever part (well I think they are anyway); I wanted a blended look but without having too many ends to darn in and I eventually worked out a way to combine four colours that fitted the bill.My other new project is probably going to be a bag, made up of blocks like this one ...This is a Log Cabin block, a traditional patchwork design where the central red square represents the hearth and the strips around it the log walls. It's a block that always makes me think of that part in Little House on the Prairie where Laura describes how Pa builds their house. In my knitted version the two strips in each colour are knitted without cutting the yarn and there is no sewing up to do. Do you like the colours I've chosen? I'm rather pleased with them, although I wasn't too sure about that lightest pink when I bought it. It's a bit garish on its own but I think it looks fine in with the other colours. All the colours for this (and the pencil case) are Stylecraft Special DK - such a useful yarn.So that's the new starts. Now for the finishes. I've recently published two patterns, one of which I've been working on for the best part of a year, on and off.This one is called Helicopters and it's another design inspired by Patchwork, this time by the Inner City block. There's a lot less sewing than you'd think in my pattern as I've picked up stitches to knit shapes wherever possible. I really like the  yarn I've used here. It's Rico Creative Melange DK which comes in a nice range of shades which have enough variegation to be interesting without being overpowering. I've just bought some more in these two lovely shades which I'm hoping to turn into a double sided Tunisian Crochet pattern.The other finish was a much quicker pattern. I started knitting it last week and published it today. The Perfect Cowl is a very easy knit - just panels of reverse stocking stitch. I've used an odd ball of Noro Silk Garden for a colourful cowl but you could use any similar weight yarn. The name comes from the perfect number that the pattern was designed around. A perfect number is one where all the numbers that divide into it can be added together to make the number. So, in the case of 28 (which I used for this pattern), 1+2+4+7+14 = 28. All those numbers play an important part in the design and no, I don't think that's a strange way to design a knitting pattern.I'll leave you with a photo of one of my quality control team testing out the work in progress earlier today. He's lying on a partially knitted blanket with his head on the new cowl and yes, that is a knitting needle under his paw.Tolly Cat"},
{"title": "Can't resist a book bag", "date": "Saturday 16 June 2018", "text": "Sam at my  local bookshop Books & Ink knows how to get me through the door. Every so often she'll offer free book bags with any purchase over £10 and, every time, I obediently trot down there to buy a book or two. This is what I got today ...First of all, that all-important book bag. It's decorated with an illustration from Judith Kerr's classic picture book 'The Tiger Who Came to Tea' which was published 50 years ago. Many will know Judith Kerr from her wonderful Mog books (my favourite is 'Mog and Bunny') but she also wrote a series of books based on her wartime experiences as a refugee from Nazi Germany. The first of these is called 'When Hitler Stole Pink Rabbit' ... and it's just struck me that maybe the pink bunny in the Mog book was inspired by her lost toy. Anyway, the book I bought today is one I saw earlier in the week when I was buying presents and resisted the temptation to add to my pile. So, my resistance crumbled today and I bought it.Frances Mountford is an artist who has written several beautifully illustrated books about the countryside; this is her first book. The whole thing is a work of art - text and pictures. Here's the title page ...She takes the modest farm in Surrey where she lives and traces its history over four hundred years and the dozen or so families who have lived in it from the 16th Century to the present day. Here are just a couple of pages; the whole book is like this ...A Quaker Wedding, 1719World War OneI love this sort of book that combines art with social history. I bought her second book 'Heartbreak Farm' a few days ago for my Dad and now I want that one too. It's not illustrated throughout but is still lovely. It tells the story of her family farming in the twentieth century. I believe she's written other books, if anyone knows of any please let me know."},
{"title": "You can never have too many colours ...", "date": "Thursday 14 June 2018", "text": "... which is just as well because look what I bought today ...This is a Scheepjes Catona Colour Pack which I found on my first ever visit to Wool Warehouse. I order yarn a lot from them (including that for my ongoing Frankie's Blankie KAL) but I'd never actually been there before. You aren't allowed in the actual warehouse but there's a nice showroom with yarn to stroke - tell me I'm not the only one that does that - and the staff will fetch anything you want to look at. They also have computers set up so that you can use their website to look at other colours of the yarns on display as well as checking what they have in stock.Anyway, I went armed with a sensible list of yarn I needed for some new designs I've got planned, mostly various shades of Stylecraft Special DK. I blame what happened next on my friend Pat. I foolishly showed her this colour pack and, before I knew where I was, I'd asked them to get it down from the warehouse for me to look at. I was dithering over it (£62!) when Pat (yes, her again) produced a code from a knitting magazine for 10% off. Well, what could I do? Obviously I bought it. Want to have a look inside?In case you're thinking that's a lot of yarn, I should mention that you can only see the top layer in this photo. There are two more underneath. Catona is a 100% cotton yarn, roughly 4 ply in weight and these little balls weigh just 10g each. There are a massive 109 colours in the range and you get one of each in this pack. To give you an idea of how tiny these little balls are, here's one making friends with a 100g ball of Stylecraft Special.As you can imagine, the yarn didn't stay in those tidy layers for long.I've just spent about an hour rootling through this colourful pile and picking out different colour combinations. Honestly it was worth buying this pack just for the fun of arranging and re-arranging all those tiny little balls of colour.There are one or two blues and greens ...... some reds and yellows ...... and a few pinks and purples ...Not quite so pretty but useful to set off all those bright colours are the browns, greys and other neutral shades.I then played around picking out a few little groups of colours with the same sort of tones.Saturated ColoursPastelsBright ColoursIt almost seems a shame to use them, doesn't it? I'm thinking of knitting something very simple with them, using the colours as the main draw. I foresee lots more play as I work out exactly what I'm going to do. And now, if you'll excuse me, I've got new yarn to stroke."},
{"title": "Farewell to Penn", "date": "Friday 8 June 2018", "text": "Last Saturday saw us making our last family trip to a secondhand bookshop that has been part of our lives for many years. The Cottage Bookshop in the little village of Penn has been attracting book lovers from far and wide for over 60 years but is now closing. When I first went there over thirty years ago the shop was still being run by the original owner, Fred. Books were piled everywhere, it was freezing cold and you could buy Puffin First Editions for 10p. I now have hundreds of Puffin Firsts and they've been joined on the shelves by lots of other collections, many of them started by a chance find at Penn.My children have been going to Penn all their lives - oh the joy when you used to be able to spend book tokens there. They would save their birthday tokens for our next visit and come away with a pile of books. My son spent many hours in this little room ...As a teenager he read almost only Fantasy books. Now he's more likely to be found searching for old Everyman's Classics to add to his collection. My daughter bought many books of animal stories at Penn and, of course, I always gravitated to the Crafts section. Our tastes in books may have changed and developed over the years but we all love children's books and are constantly buying new ones. Last year saw The Great Picture Book Divide when we shared out our huge collection of picture books. It was surprisingly easy to do and led to us re-discovering so many old favourites. Of course, since then, we've each been looking for replacements for books that weren't in our share. Here are the picture books at Penn ...... well, some of them anyway. Then there are more children's books upstairs ...... another section of children's paperback fiction ...... and, a particular favourite of us all, children's books from the past.Last Saturday my daughter found an interesting book here, illustrated by one of the sisters of Joyce Lankester Brisley, the author and illustrator of the Milly-Molly-Mandy Stories.So, I expect you're wondering what we bought on our last visit to such a wonderful shop? Here they are, 154 books all together (it helped that all the stock was half price).And here's my share of that total - a mere 45 books.Looking at this picture I seem to have got a bit of everything, which is rather nice. I thought you might like to see a few of my favourites so let's start with some children's books.Two more Puffin Firsts to add to my collection; I absolutely love anything by Walter de la Mare so that one was an easy choice. Mary Norton is perhaps best known for her series of books about The Borrowers (wonderful books) but 'Bedknob and Broomstick' gained new readers when it was turned into a popular Disney film in 1971. It was Disney who turned both words into plurals; recent editions of the book are now called 'Bedknobs and Broomsticks' too. I bought 'The Penguin Book of Contemporary Verse' mainly for its beautiful yellow cover, designed by Stephen Ross. By the way, 'contemporary' in this case refers to poetry published between 1918 and 1960. Mind you, this selection was made in 1962 so that's fair enough.How about a few picture books next?I love the Teddy Bear series of books which are getting hard to find now. In each book the teddy bear of the title does a different job and the gentle text and illustrations take the reader through his day. At no point do any of the other (human) characters notice that they're dealing with a teddy bear. At the end of this book, after looking after the stock, going to market and all sorts of other grown-up activities (yes, that's him driving a tractor on the cover), Teddy Bear Farmer goes to bed ... and looks at pictures in a book. Isn't that lovely? This next book was published in 1968 and written by Jane Thayer, an American author I hadn't come across before.'The Cat That Joined the Club' is about a cat called Casey whose nose for fine food leads him into adventure. The illustrations are by Seymour Fleishman, a prolific children's book artist in the second half of the twentieth century. This little book is a small hardback, not much over six inches square.'The Little Green Book' by the artist Cherry Denham has a strong environmental message as it follows the life cycle of the tree. Each page is beautifully illustrated and the artwork is complemented by quotations from poets ranging from Andrew Marvell to Ralph Waldo Emerson.To mark our last visit to Penn I bought my son and daughter a special book each which I wrote in and they bought me one. This is the one I chose for myself.'Lavender's Blue', a Nursery Rhyme collection, compiled by Kathleen Lines and illustrated by Harold Jones. It's a beautiful book.I see that you can buy a paperback edition of this book from the Oxford University Press where I learn that it has been in print for over 60 years.Time for a some more poetry I think.A late and very long poem on the nature of time by Walter de la Mare (told you I liked him), a collection chosen by Malcolm Saville, author of the Lone Pine series and a tiny hardback from the 1040s called 'Rhymes for Young Nature Lovers'. It may not be great literature but I'm a sucker for a book with pretty pictures.This one was bought to replace the copy that my son got in the Great Picture Book Divide.'Ragged Robin' is an alphabet of poems by the great James Reeves, published in 1961. The illustrations are by Jane Paton. I was so pleased to find exactly the same edition as our original copy.I bought this collection of three books purely for sentimental reasons.My Mum read this series of books and I remember seeing just these editions on the shelves as a child. Lillian Beckwith based this entertaining series of books on her time living on a croft in the Scottish Hebrides and she certainly tells a good tale. There are more than these three titles in the series but, be warned, her later book 'The Small Party' is a thinly disguised tirade against Trades Unions - not such a good read.By now you might be wondering where the craft books are. I've bought many treasured knitting and sewing books at Penn over the years but this time I got just one new craft book and that's really a children's book too.First published in 1956, this book is described as having 'over fifty easy things to do for boys and girls'. The wallpaper beads are right up to date but I'm not too sure about wire animals covered with papier-mâché - they look like a lot of work to me.A few more pretty books and that'll be enough children's books for today.I seem to be building up quite a collection of what I can only call old, pretty children's books. I like the bright covers and simple illustrations; here's a spread from that doll book on top of the pile.Or how about this from 'My Who's Who of Pets and Animal Friends', published in the 1950s.See the heron on the right hand page? We saw one of those just after leaving the shop but more about that later. I've left my most exciting finds till last (or nearly last). Do you remember the Fred Wild book I showed you that I bought a few weeks ago? Well, I found his other two books at Penn.You can imagine how excited I was when I spotted these on the shelves. They're just as good as the seaside book, full of details of life in the 1920s and 30s. I particularly like this picture in 'The clatter of clogs in the early morning' of the Sale of Work - well, I would, wouldn't I?I love the combination of art and social history in this sort of book. Another series of books like this are those by Helen Bradley She began to paint pictures of her Edwardian childhood at the age of 65 to show her grandchildren what life was like when she was a child. Her first book 'And Miss Carter Wore Pink' was published in 1971 and became a great success. Here's one I bought earlier (probably at Penn) ...The book is full of the daily life in a Northern village at the start of the twentieth century, shopping, outings and visits to friends. The author's three maiden aunts, Mary, Frances and Charlotte appear often, as does their friend Miss Carter (who wore pink). I think this picture of a visit to the cemetery is particularly touching. Death would have been close to many families then.Here's part of the text that goes with this picture:Everyone brought spring flowers to the cemetery and George and I looked at our favourite angel whilst Mother and the Aunts made Grandfather's grave look gay with flowers. Miss Carter (who wore Pink) had a large grave to keep nice, for both her parents and brother were dead.Anyway, as you've probably guessed, I found two more Helen Bradley books at Penn last week. 'Miss Carter Came With Us' tells the story of 1908, including the suffragette meeting (where Miss Carter faints) and a trip to the seaside.Throughout the books it is apparent that Miss Carter is rather taken with Mr Taylor the Bank Manager but, on this occasion, he pays more attention to Mrs Maitland's daughter Emily.It was growing dusk and the tide was coming in, and Mother, the Aunts and Miss Carter thought it very kind of Mr Taylor to come to escort us home. Emily Maitland was just behind him, and as he turned, he took her hand, and Aunt Frances told Mother afterwards that she was sure he had said \"My Dear\", but whatever it was that he said, Emily went Bright Pink. Miss Carter looked hurt, and never spoke a word all the way home.Poor Miss Carter.The third Helen Bradley book, ''In the beginning' said Great-Aunt Jane', is slightly surreal. It's based on the stories Helen Bradley's aunt told her about God when she was a small child, including the one about him living in a shed on the moors and making it rain by turning his tap on and off. The pictures are a mixture of real life and the child's Helen's dreams. This one of Jonah's whale appearing in the park is typical.This a just a small selection of the books I bought on our last visit to Penn. We spent all morning in the shop, emerging in search of lunch, weighed down with all our books. Penn has a lovely village pond and, as he often is, the heron was on duty.You can't see him in this picture but, when we were there, he was lurking behind that little island. There are always ducks on the pond and last week there were lots of ducklings too. On one visit to Penn years ago we watched the ducks stage a traffic protest. They solemnly marched across the road, stopping all the traffic, then flew back to the pond and lined up to cross the road again. It was very entertaining to watch; they must have done it three or four times in a row.I hope you've enjoyed yet another book themed post. If anyone can recommend other good secondhand bookshops in England, the Brown family now has a Penn sized hole to fill."},
{"title": "This and That but Mostly Books", "date": "Tuesday 29 May 2018", "text": "There's been a lot of sorting going on here lately. I'm gradually re-arranging, decorating and generally de-cluttering this old house so that it suits me, rather than me and the two children who are both now definitely grown up and gone. I have long term plans to turn my son's room into one big craft room full of weaving looms (note the plural), my new spinning wheel (which I haven't got yet) and lots of yarn and craft books. In the short term, each room is having a big turn out. I think I may be single-handedly keeping the local charity shops supplied at the moment.I have to admit I'm not doing all this on my own. I'm not very good at sorting and get discouraged easily. Halfway through and with big piles of stuff all over the floor, I have a tendency to creep away and close the door on it all. Luckily my daughter is extremely good at sorting and she keeps me in order. She and her partner have just spent the Bank Holiday weekend here and we got so much done. If I tell you that there were 23 bags of garden rubbish and a car full of stuff for the charity shop, you'll have some idea of how hard we worked.We were too busy to take photos (and anyway, I'd prefer not to have photographic evidence of all that mess) but I can show you my new / old chairs in the front room. I finally found a suite to replace the tatty settees I'd had for donkey's years and, like most things I buy, it was secondhand, this time from Brackley Antiques.I'm not a fan of modern, squashy chairs so this upright settee is ideal for me. It's firm and at last I don't need my back cushion to sit comfortably. I also got two armchairs and, as you can see, the cats took to them straight away.That's Linnet in prime position on the back (she likes to supervise the outside world) and Tolly sprawled on the seat. He obviously missed the 'cats always sit tidily' lesson as he nearly always lies like that, often with both sets of paws crossed. All this sorting has rather got in the way of knitting but I have finally finished my Helicopter blanket. Mind you, I nearly cried when, after knitting lots of silly little shapes to fill in the edges, I realised I still had to knit the borders.Hundreds and hundreds of stitches. I got them done in the end with the help of my latest audiobook, Rebecca. The blanket is now blocked and ready to be photographed and written up as a pattern.Last weekend my son and I had one of our regular trips to Stratford, this time to see The Fantastic Follies of Mrs Rich at The Swan. It was a great play and, as normal, we also had a look in the secondhand bookshop. It's called The Chaucer Head Bookshop and I'd recommend a visit if you're going to Stratford. This time I found three treasures, one familiar and two new.The familiar one was another Flora Klickmann book to add to my collection. Flora Klickmann was the editor of The Girl's Own Paper in the early twentieth century and also wrote many books, including quite a few needlework titles. This is the one I found ...The Little Girl's Sewing BookI was particularly excited to find this as it's the companion volume to another one of her books that I already have.'The Little Girl's Knitting & Crochet Book' is a bit tatty but they're both great books with nice illustrations. Here are just a couple of pages from the sewing book.They also have lovely adverts for wool long gone.My next find also harks back to the early part of the twentieth century, this time to seaside holidays in the 1920s and '30s.The artist Fred Wilde was born near Manchester and published three books in the 1980s, inspired by his childhood. This one conjures up all the magic of an English seaside holiday and many of the scenes are as true today as they were all those years ago. Who hasn't had one of these days on holiday in a typical English summer?This next picture is one of my favourites. The author recalls being able to get a pot of tea with cups and saucers and a jug of hot water to take on to the sands - all for three shillings. Now there's a practice I'd like to see revived. A picnic's not a picnic without a cup of tea.The last book I found is one of a series of anthologies that I'd never seen before. It was published in 1954 and is edited by John Hadfield who specialised in this sort of book. He also edited many editions of The Saturday Book, an annual anthology published between 1942 and 1975. And yes, I collect those too.Anyway, this one has some interesting and unusual choices of poetry and prose, together with lovely art. 'A Contemplation Upon Flowers' by Henry King (written before 1630) is illustrated by a Dutch flower painting by Jan Davidz De Heem.I'm very fond of Dutch flower paintings; I took my children to see an exhibition of them at the Dulwich Picture Gallery many years ago and I can thoroughly recommend these paintings to capture children's interest. They're bright and beautiful and there are often little creatures to spot amongst the flowers. I see that Dulwich have got an Edward Bawden exhibition on at the moment. I shall have to go to that; it will follow on nicely from the Ravilious exhibition that I've been to several times recently at Compton Verney (buying a membership card was worth it for this exhibition alone).One more page from this book ...Gerard Manley Hopkins and Stanley Spencer - what an inspired juxtaposition. Here's the first verse of the poem, written in 1877 and so fresh and modern.                                          Glory be to God for dappled things -                                          For skies of couple-colour as a brinded cow;                                          For rose-moles all in stipple upon trout that swim;                                          Fresh-firecoal chestnut-falls; finches wings;                                          Landscape plotted and pieced - fold, fallow and plough;                                          And all trades, their gear and tackle and trim.Hopkins is best read out loud I think. I've discovered Spencer's paintings recently through the art historian Dr Liv Gibbs who regularly shares his paintings on Twitter. Do have a look at her Twitter feed; she tweets lots of interesting art every day, often with a topical theme.And now I must stop. As normal, it's taken me hours to write this; I always think I'll just do a quick blog post and then get carried away - so much to talk about."},
{"title": "Before Hermione", "date": "Monday 30 April 2018", "text": "There are many good things about the Harry Potter books by J K Rowling. I always think she's a bit like a modern day Dickens with her fast paced, intricate plots and her distinctive characters. Both authors know how to balance tension with a good ear for speech and humour; their books work very well when read aloud. As for the names ... Dumbledore, Voldemort, Lovegood, Malfoy, Longbottom - these could all be characters in Dickens and both Diagon Alley and Hogsmeade are definitely Dickensian.But it's the character of Hermione Grainger that I want to talk about here. Hermione isn't pretty and she doesn't fit in easily at school because she's clever (something that clever girls will still recognise). In the first book she's seen as a 'know all' by her classmates and doesn't really have friends until battling a troll with Harry and Ron forces them together (as it would). As the books progress, her intelligence often saves them but she also shows herself to be brave and passionate. By the last book she has gone from being the rather geeky, awkward girl to the one person who sees what Harry has to do when he walks into the forest alone.Hermione is a beacon to girls who are clever, girls who aren't pretty, girls who never know what to say in a group, girls who just don't fit in. She makes it cool to read all the time, to like Maths (what else is Arithomancy?), to not be good at or even interested in sports ... just to be different.So, who was there before Hermione?When I think about the books I loved as a child in the 1960s and 70s, they all had strong girls in them and none of them were new books. The characters that I identified with (and still do) were all created in the late nineteenth or early twentieth century, at least fifty years before I was born.First there was Mary Lennox. Mary appears at the start of The Secret Garden by Frances Hodgson Burnett as a plain, disagreeable and lonely child with no understanding of others. Gradually, she opens out and, as she helps the neglected garden back to life, so she too grows. From feeling out of place in a strange and alien world, she comes to belong there, both in the house and garden and with the people she meets.I always pictured Mary with long, dark hair because that's what I had and was surprised when illustrators gave her fair hair but she is fair - I'd obviously ignored that bit every time I read it. This was my copy of the book as a child.Many of my childhood books were Puffins. The cover illustration is by the wonderful Shirley Hughes who also illustrated this lovely edition.I always liked the part where Martha shows Mary how to skip and, as for Dickon, he was just the perfect hero. Although Mary gains so much from the people she meets at Misselthwaite Manor, she is the one who has the courage and determination to force them to challenge what they've always accepted. It's not only the garden that she brings back to life.There are many lovely editions of this book. This one, published by Walker Books, has beautiful illustrations by Inga Moore.When I'm clearing weeds to let plants breathe I think of Mary, when I enjoy fresh air I think of Dickon and I've still got a fondness for a walled garden.Recently I've read a sequel to 'The Secret Garden', written by Holly Webb. Return to the Secret Garden is set during the Second World War when an orphanage is evacuated to Misselthwaite Manor. I'm normally wary of sequels to classic books but this one works well. It would be a good read even if you didn't know the original book but, if you do, then it's really quite special.I think I read A Little Princess, also by Frances Hodgson Burnett, even more times than 'The Secret Garden'. So much so that my original copy (another Puffin) is falling apart.Sara Crewe does indeed start the book as something of a princess, coming to boarding school in Edwardian London with rich clothes and expensive toys. But then her father dies and she is forced to work as a servant in the school. Much of the book is taken up with her attempts to turn her cold attic room and bleak life into something bearable, helped only by her imagination. Yes, the message of 'kindness is more important than wealth' may seem a little heavy-handed now but I loved Sara and especially the way she could turn the everyday into the magical.Holly Webb has written a sequel to this book too, The Princess and the Suffragette, featuring Sara's friend Lottie. I haven't read this one yet but am hoping it will be as good as 'Return to the Secret Garden'.The power of the imagination is at the heart of another of my much-loved books, Anne of Green Gables by L M Montgomery. Anne Shirley is a plain and outspoken girl who arrives at Green Gables from the orphanage by mistake and then proceeds to shake the staid little community with her wild ways. There are dark memories in Anne's past and, like Sara Crewe, she has dealt with these with the help of her imagination. Now she throws herself into her new life with a wholehearted enthusiasm that leads her into scrapes but also wins her many friends.Anne lives by extremes, she looks for 'kindred spirits' among her new classmates and hates with a passion too. She lives in her own world of books and stories and argues with anyone and everyone. As the book goes on and Anne grows up she does learn to control her temper and behave more 'appropriately' but she's still the clever, tough girl that she always was.I re-read 'Anne of Green Gables' recently and was surprised at how revolutionary Anne still seems as a character. If you haven't met her yet, you've got a treat in store.Just for a change, the girl in the next book isn't an orphan. In fact, Jo March in Little Women by Louisa May Alcott is very much part of a loving family. Another Puffin illustrated by Shirley HughesIt wasn't the story that appealed to me so much as the character of Jo. She reads books, she's loud and she wants to break out and do things, rather than be a 'little woman'. And what does this wonderful girl get as her reward? A boring husband. Ah well, I shall just remember her in the attic with her russets and her books ...The last of my girls is another American from the second half of the nineteenth century, although her life is very different from Jo's. Laura Ingalls Wilder's series of Little House books are based on her own childhood as part of a pioneer family.I read the Laura books as they were published in this country as Puffin books in the 1960s. I remember the excitement of waiting for the next one, shared with my Mum who was reading them too.I loved the detailed descriptions of Ma making cheese or Pa building their log cabin on the prairie.After reading about this, you feel that you too would be able to build a log cabin - should the need ever arise. In the early books Laura is a bit of a tomboy (always a good thing) but, as she grows older, you also see how strong she has to be to overcome her own natural shyness and the trials that the family face.I think my favourite book is The Long Winter which recounts the hard months of 1880 -81 when the town of De Smet was snowed in and the Ingalls family nearly starved. The writing becomes almost dream-like as they grow more and more malnourished and everyday existence gets harder and slower. Even in this book though there are warm moments of shared family time; Laura's often mixed feelings about her sister Mary are always touching.By the time we get to These Happy Golden Years Laura is sixteen and teaching school miles from home. She doesn't want to teach and she doesn't want to leave her family; the strength she finds to do both is inspiring. She's so much more than just a tomboy now.If you are interested in the facts behind these books, I can recommend Pioneer Girl, her annotated autobiography which also has a wealth of pictures. Anyone want to see what Cap Garland really looked like? I'm also looking forward to reading Prairie Fires by Caroline Fraser which has won the 2018 Pulitzer prize for Biography.Thinking about it now, I realise how much the girls in these books have meant to me. Whether it's putting books first, looking for kindred spirits or trying to play the violin like Pa, they've become part of my life. Mind you, I still haven't built that log cabin."},
{"title": "School Prizes", "date": "Monday 16 April 2018", "text": "My daughter and I have just had a 'sorting' weekend. We worked very hard and there's now a mountain of stuff in the hall waiting to be taken to the charity shop. One of the things we sorted was all my old children's books which had been scattered fairly randomly around the top floor of the house (they were actually on shelves, not on the floor - well, mostly anyway). They're now beautifully organised and it was very exciting to find some old favourites.It was particularly nice to see my Mum's old books from when she was a child again. They're now about seventy years old and showing signs of their age, having been read by several generations. Amongst them were some school prizes so I thought you might like to see those, together with a couple that I got at about the same age.Mum's are the ones with plain covers and are from the 1940s. My two are from the 1970s. We were both around ten or eleven when we got them. I couldn't find a picture of me at that age but here's one of Mum.Her earliest school prize dates from 1944 and is a book of stories called 'When the Fire Burns Blue' by Dorothy Ann Lovell.I see that the teacher who wrote the inscription in this book was Mrs Blake. She taught at New Street School in Andover for many years and ended her career at the newly built Balksbury School in the same town ... where, some 26 years after writing in Mum's book, she taught me. This would have been a very special prize in 1944 when rationing was in force, making books harder to get. The stories in the book are whimsical and accompanied by some lovely line drawings. I remember reading this one 'Little Red Bird' again and again.The bird is a mechanical one who sings when children put a penny in the slot in his cage. One day, while his owner Mrs Hurley, dozes by the sea, the bird flies from his cage for a short taste of freedom. When he looks down from the sky and sees Mrs Hurley and her worn shoes he remembers that she relies on the pennies he makes and returns to the cage before she wakes up.Mum's next prize was a small book of Grimm's Fairy Tales, published by Everyman. The endpapers on old Everyman books are always beautiful. These were designed by the artist Eric Ravilious, one of my favourite artists and he was also responsible for this icon on the title page.I learnt from the Everyman's Library Collecting website that different icons were used for different categories of books; this one was for books aimed at 'Young People'. I've just been to the wonderful exhibition Ravilious & Co: The Pattern of Friendship at Compton Verney which was so good I think I shall have to go again.I don't remember reading the Fairy Tales book much but I did read this one many times.Mum won this one in the Summer of 1948 and it's a classic girls' boarding school story. There's trouble over a missing postal order (remember those?) and someone waylays Esme and locks her in Matron's cupboard - that sort of thing.My two prize books date from around 1970; I seem to remember that we were asked what sort of book we would like and I chose poetry for my first one.'My Kind of Verse' is a selection of all sorts of poetry, ranging from Nursery Rhymes to Keats and Shakespeare. I've always loved poetry and I learnt some of these by heart.I devised my own dance to go with 'I had  little nut tree' which I would perform at the drop of a hat (yes I was that sort of child). I love the fact that this rhyme shares the page with Yeats and Thomas Moore; that's what I call a proper anthology.I got my second prize a year later and this time I chose a book of Shakespeare stories.I really loved this book and read the stories so many times. I think my favourite was 'As You Like It', although I now prefer 'Much Ado'. I went on to study English Literature at University and now go to watch Shakespeare plays at the RSC regularly so this was obviously a good choice.One day I'll show you some of the other old children's books I got from my Mum but I think that's enough for now. By the way, do you like the old brushed cotton sheet I've used as the background for the photos? I bought it in a charity shop to back a quilt top I pieced a few years ago. I really must make a start on that.And here's a picture of Tolly Cat who's been sitting on my lap 'helping' me write this.How would I manage without him?"},
{"title": "Blankie Progress", "date": "Wednesday 4 April 2018", "text": "Knitters working on my year long blanket pattern Frankie's Blankie are now a quarter of the way through this project. Twelve squares have been knitted and sewn together (although some are still waiting for their visit from the sewing-up fairy who seems to have quite a lot on her plate at the moment). The squares are a mixture of plain ones using all sorts of textured stitches and coloured ones, worked in a variety of slip stitch patterns.I have been completely amazed by how popular this blanket has proved to be. When I was designing it last year, I wondered whether people might think it a bit dull - just 48 blocks, one after the other - but I needn't have worried. Lots of people are knitting it and they seem to be enjoying discovering new stitch patterns.The best thing though is the community that has developed on my ravelry group. There's a special thread there for chat about the blanket and, as I write this, it has 2823 posts. Knitters from all over the world meet there every day to compare notes about their progress and help each other. It's like a very friendly, international knitting group. Mind you, we don't just talk about the blanket. Our conversation has ranged from families to chickens, by way of rubbish collections, the weather and just about anything else you can think of. I'm already thinking that I'll have to do something next year to keep this community going. Not another 50 pattern project though.Anyway, I thought it would be nice to share photos of some of the blankets being knitted. One of the lovely things has been to see how people have taken my basic pattern and made it their own, either with different yarn or different colours. It makes me want to knit another one, using some of their ideas. I'll start thought with a few blankets in the Stylecraft Batik DK that I used for my blanket.Debbie, from EnglandThese are Debbie's squares for the first month. As you can see, each set of four blocks is sewn together, with the coloured squares being turned on their sides. It looks more interesting if the lines of pattern don't all run the same way and it also helps to even up the squares which can end up slightly different sizes. Debbie's made a particularly good job of her sewing up - I don't think my 'month blocks' were that square.Mari-Elaine, from EnglandMari-Elaine is also using the Batik for her blanket. Here you can see all the squares for the first three months sewn together. That's one row of the blanket done; there will be three more below it by the end of the  year.Amity is using cream Batik for her main yarn and then replacing all the colours with one multi-coloured yarn. She's chosen another Stylecraft Batik yarn called Elements and is using the Sulfur colourway.Amity, from EnglandAs you can see, she also has a furry helper when it comes to blocking her knitting. Every time I see one of Amity's blocks, I'm struck again by how well that variegated yarn works. Here's a closer look at her squares for February.Of course, lots of knitters have chosen their own yarn for knitting the blanket. A lot of fun was had choosing yarn and then deciding on the colours. Ruth is knitting her Treasure Buster Blanket in 100% wool, using yarns from Drops and Kammgarn.Ruth, from GermanyI think this one looks particularly fresh and bright; I'm looking forward to seeing it grow.How about this one for a different look?Sue, from the United StatesDon't those squares look great with grey as the main colour? This one's very popular on my group. Sue is using various shades of Plymouth Yarn's Encore Worsted; I had to resist the temptation to start another blanket when I first saw this combination.Anysia is using a very popular yarn for her blanket, Red Heart Super Saver in solid colours.Anysia, from the United StatesThis is another fresh looking blanket in the making. It's interesting how much clearer those slip stitch patterns are when worked with one contrast colour, rather than a mixture.Maggie's blanket makes me think of sunny days and long, cool drinks ...Maggie, from EnglandShe's using Caron Simply Soft yarn, mostly from her stash. This is a yarn I'm not familiar with but I think I shall have to give it a try; it comes in a huge range of colours.Lots of people are dipping into their stash for this project, resulting in some beautiful colour combinations and blankets that will be unique. Here are just a few examples ...Laurel, from WalesIsn't this gorgeous? Grey again, it works so well to set off all the other colours. Why does this one make me think of ice-cream? I don't think I've ever knowingly eaten a grey ice-cream.Jenny, from AustraliaAnother pretty set of colours from Jenny - also, why didn't I think of taking photos of long strips of knitting like that? It's got to be easier than balancing on steps which is what I normally end up doing.There are also some knitters who are using completely different yarn. Corien has chosen a thinner 100% wool yarn from Wol met Verve so her blanket will be smaller than mine.Corien, from the NetherlandsIt's going to be beautiful when it's finished. There's one blanket that's going to take longer than the others to complete but that's for a very good reason. Lou is using only handspun yarn - how impressive is that?Lou, from the United StatesDon't those blocking pins look good? That's one of the many things I've discovered from the chat amongst the Blanketeers (thanks to Isabel for that name). They're called Knit Blockers and are made by Knit Pro. I think I shall have to invest in a set.Of course, some people can't be content to make just one blanket. Paula is knitting two at once (and keeping up with everyone else). One is in solid colours and the other uses a variegated yarn and then different colours for the single colour squares.Paula, from Australia I really like this one with the pastel colours. Wouldn't it be a beautiful blanket for a baby? I think using different colours for the 'plain' squares works very well.I hope you've enjoyed this look at some of the lovely blankets being knitted this year. If it's made you want to join in, it's not too late. You can download all the patterns so far by following the links on my Frankie's Blankie page and then come and introduce yourself on my group (2824 posts now). There's no pressure to finish your blanket in a set time so  you can just enjoy the journey. If you want to use the same yarn as me, you can order it from Wool Warehouse who are super quick at sending out orders.

{"title": "Spring Finishing", "date": "Wednesday 28 March 2018", "text": "I think Spring Finishing is a much better idea than Spring Cleaning. Actually, I've been doing some of that too but didn't think you'd appreciate photos of my scruffy house (and that's after the cleaning).My first finish is the Tunisian Crochet scarf I told you about a few weeks ago. This was from the pattern in the book Tunisian Crochet Workshop and it was a fun, quick project. Here it is being modelled by the ever patient Mr Bennet.What do you mean, you don't have a life size cuddly sheep in your house? What do you do when you want to photograph a scarf or shawl then? My sheep is named after Mr Bennet in Pride and Prejudice whose patience is also sorely tried.I was going to add pompoms to the ends of the scarf but, in the end, just sewed on some bright coloured buttons instead. Which reminds me, I've started my own button Charmstring. Victorian ladies used to collect buttons on a string like this; they all had to be different and the buttons had to be given, not bought. The idea was to collect 999 buttons, at which point the love of your life would appear and give you button number 1,000.I've got about a dozen buttons so far so I've got quite a way to go. As you can see, these are all metal buttons; I'm tempted to start another one with bright coloured plastics. It's probably as well to hedge your bets; it would be a bit sad if Prince Charming turned up with the wrong sort of button and I had to send him away.I've also finished the crochet blanket that I started making out of some old Noro crochet squares I found in a box. I crocheted round each one, crocheted them together and then added a border. The border took a while as I kept thinking \"just one more round\". Anyway, it's been washed, blocked (and had the cat hairs it acquired during blocking removed) and I'm pleased with it.I've been putting up a few decorations for Easter too, well ... the odd bunny anyway.I'll put vases of daffodils everywhere tomorrow and then it will look more Spring - like. I do like my Springtime Wreath. You don't need much else when you've got one of these to hang up.See that mottled effect in the top right corner of the picture? That's what you get when the sun shines through old, Victorian wobbly glass.With Easter in mind, I knitted up some little flower brooches the other day. I've got a small collection of old china posy brooches and my knitted flowers match them nicely.You can get the free pattern for my Spring Posies from ravelry as normal. They can be made as normal brooches or you can use a paper clip to turn them into buttonholes.I think I'll go and do some quality control on those little chocolate eggs I bought now ..."},
{"title": "Back on my Needles", "date": "Friday 16 March 2018", "text": "Back in October 2015 my daughter gave me a very exciting birthday present - a yarn advent calendar.There were 24 doors to open and behind each was a mini ball of Opal sock yarn. Each one weighed about 15 g and they all had suitably festive tiny ball bands.I really enjoyed finding the new yarn each day and knitted one square with each colour during advent.Then, in the New Year, I knitted two more squares from each little ball. The three above all came from one colourway. As you can see, I added some plain cream yarn to break up all that colour (as well as making the yarn go further). And this is what I turned all those little squares into ...This is my Patchwork Pelerine, a cross between a shawl and a poncho. It buttons up down the front and has a straight hem on one side and a pointed one on the other. This is one of my favourite things to wear, I really love it.This of course left me with about 4 or 5 g each of 24 different variegated yarns which I was determined to use up. So, later in 2016, I turned them into 24 little Advent Stars, each with their own number.I was so pleased to have used up every scrap of yarn that I decided to repeat the whole project and treated myself to the next Opal Advent Calendar in Winter 2016.And this is where I got stuck. It didn't take me long to decide what to knit - folded flowers that I would turn into a quilt. So, off I went ...So far, so good. Easy to knit and pretty on both sides. Now I knew I was going to need to add some other yarn to be able to make something big enough to justify being called a blanket. Having used cream as my contrast colour for the Pelerine, I decided to use a dark colour this time and found a nice dark grey Opal yarn.Yes, I know they're different sizes - my tension may not always be spot on.The plan was to alternate the coloured flowers with the grey ones ... the only problem was, when I laid the first few out, I didn't like how it looked.Too heavy looking and the coloured flowers look a bit odd in amongst the grey. Now, having hit this problem, you might think that I'd have tried a different contrast colour or played around with the arrangement. But no, what I actually did was put the flowers away in a basket and forget about them for a year. I didn't seem to be able to get past my original plan.Anyway, last week I got them all out again (feeling rather guilty at having neglected them for so long) and, straight away, it dawned on me that I could just space the grey flowers out a bit.Already it looks better and there are other arrnagements I could try. Perhaps a grey flower in the centre surrounded by coloured flowers and then the occasional ring of grey? Why didn't I think of that a year ago?So I'm now steaming ahead, knitting lots more flowers so that I can play with other ways of arranging them.The eagle-eyed among you will spot that I've knitted just a few more of the coloured ones than the grey. In fact there are 31 coloured flowers and 9 grey ones (I had to count them three times, I was sure I'd done more than that). This is because the grey ones are boring to knit! I'm now making myself knit two grey flowers for every coloured one in an effort to even them up a bit.Maybe I'll actually get this quilt finished and turned into a pattern this year. I wonder if Opal are planning an Advent Calendar for 2018?This isn't the only old project I've resurrected recently. When sorting out boxes of beads the other day I came across a box full of crochet squares. Don't ask me why they were in a box with the beads, I have no idea. I remember making them with odd balls of Noro Silk Garden Lite more than ten years ago.There were 25 squares all together and it seemed a shame to leave them in that box (also, I needed it for beading supplies) so I decided to turn them into a quick blanket. I'm crocheting round them with some Stylecraft Special DK in Parchment that I bought by mistake (please tell me that happens to you too) and then I'll crochet them together.I'm having to resist the temptation to abandon my proper woolly work and just do these at the moment. I'm trying only to do one after I've done some proper work. This morning I spent several hours cutting and sticking bits of card to make a prototype for this year's big Christmas pattern so that definitely earned me a bit of crochet. I wonder if writing a blog post counts too?"},
{"title": "Learning New Stuff", "date": "Tuesday 6 March 2018", "text": "There's something about learning how to do new things that's exciting and very satisfying. This is why I try to fit too many crafts into the time available. Recently I've been expanding my Tunisian Crochet skills with the help of a very good book by Michelle Robinson, the Australian designer behind the Poppy & Bliss blog. It's called Tunisian Crochet Workshop and it certainly lives up to its name. There's lots of helpful advice, a good selection of stitch patterns and some really nice patterns.I'm often disappointed by the projects in craft books; they can be a bit basic. That's definitely not the case with this one. There are several scarves, yes, but they're interesting and focus on different skills. You could learn entrelac by working that beautiful rainbow project bag and there's a fantastic sampler blanket - I think it's worth buying the book just for those two projects.So, what have I made? Well, I started off with the first project in the book, these Tassel Pouches.These are worked in the round ... on one straight hook. I know, it doesn't sound possible, does it? Once I grasped the technique, I loved making my little purse. You work the round in sections, back and forth ... which seems to make no sense at all. The author explains it much better than I can.I used a different weight yarn and adjusted the number of rounds but I was quite pleased with my finished purse.It took me ages deciding how to decorate it. In the end I settled on some nice old buttons on one side and a bit of weaving on the other. That was another tip from the book - I'd never thought of adding weaving to the finished crochet. As the basic Tunisian simple stitch is square you could also use cross stitch.Now I'm making this scarf.This uses one ball of variegated sock yarn and teaches you how to shape your crochet and add eyelets. Michelle recommends blocking the finished scarf to open up the eyelets but I think I'll leave mine as it is; I like the ripply look.This is mine so far. The yarn is Stylecraft Head Over Heels and the shade is called Matterhorn. I love the way the stripes are working out. The pattern tells you to increase until you've used half your yarn and then decrease - nice and simple - but I stopped at 40 stitches and then worked straight for a while. I'm ready to start the decrease section now. If I have enough yarn left over, I think I'll add some pompoms to the ends.The other craft I've been playing with lately isn't exactly new. I've made jewellery for many years but it's been a while since I got my beads and stuff out. Anyway, I had a play with some chain, jump rings and buttons the other day and made two bracelets with matching earrings.For the first set I used various brightly coloured plastic buttons; I think these will look nice in the summer. The second set is made with antique looking chain and rings that I bought intending to venture into Steampunk jewellery. The buttons are all old ones with shanks. I had a lovely time choosing these. It reminded me that I've been collecting special buttons, intending to make a Charmstring; I really must get started on threading them.The third thing I've been learning recently isn't completely new either. I've had my Tenor recorder for some years but have never got very far with it because of the stretch for the fingers of my right hand. So, I've been concentrating on the Alto instead. I've found Sarah Jeffery's videos on her Team Recorder channel really helpful. She's full of energy and the videos are always entertaining as well as packed with useful information and tips. She talks about Baroque music, modern music, all the different recorders, how to breathe properly, hand position ... oh, and there's also a video on how to make a recorder out of a carrot. Anyway, recently Sarah made a video just about the Tenor recorder, Getting Started on the Tenor Recorder and this has made me get my Tenor out again and have another go. Not that I'm easily influenced, but the fact that one of the recorders she plays in the video is the same as mine really encouraged me. Then it occurred to me that if I can stretch the fingers on my left hand for the violin as I have over the last year, then I can do the same for the recorder.And, so far, it seems to be working. I can't say that I can suddenly get those bottom notes easily but I am improving. I think half the battle is having the confidence that you will get there eventually with practice. The music I've been playing is a collection of English Folk Tunes which is great. I particularly like the tunes from John Playford's 17th Century dance book. The ones on the pages in the picture are 'Jack's Maggot', 'Portsmouth' and 'Old Noll's Jig' - wonderful names.In case you're wondering about the different recorders, there are many sizes ranging from the tiny Garkleins which are about 6\" long to the Contrabasses which are as tall as a person. The most commonly played sizes however are the Soprano, Alto, Tenor and Bass. These are in the keys of C, F, C and F respectively, which means that any music in C written for the Soprano recorder can also be played on the Tenor. Here are my Soprano, Alto and Tenor recorders together to give you an idea of the sizes.The Soprano is also known as the Descant recorder and is the one most children start with. I've had mine for many years and, although it was good at the time, there are much better plastic recorders available now. I'm thinking of buying one to match my Alto which is an Aulos 709W and has a lovely tone. My Tenor is a Yamaha YRT304B. Obviously, good wooden recorders are much better than plastic ones but they're also much more expensive so I'm happy with these.I'll leave you with a video of the Royal Wind Recorder Consort playing a short piece by the wonderful John Dowland. Isn't the recorder a beautiful instrument?"},
{"title": "Weavies", "date": "Wednesday 28 February 2018", "text": "Just recently I've been a tiny bit obsessed with these little things.Welcome to the world of the weavies. These are small crochet circles with twelve holes round the edge. By threading yarn through the holes in various combinations of straight lines, you can make all sorts of patterns. Little woolly works of art.In case you're thinking \"looks a bit like Spirograph to me\", well you'd be right. Want to see my new toy?This was one of my favourite toys as a child (although my set was much more basic than this one), even though the patterns were frustratingly hard to do. Guess what? They still are. I'm not quite sure why I thought it would be a good idea to get a big set with fancy pieces this time round as it's all I can do to cope with the basic wheels and rings.Having said that, I have found a few things to help. Following the advice on Spirographic Art, I replaced the blu-tack (which in turn replaced the original pins) with rare earth magnets and a thin sheet of metal. You put the metal sheet under the paper and the magnets, which are very strong, hold the rings in place.The other thing that's improved in the Spirograph world since the 1960s is pens. Actually, the ones that come with it work pretty well.But I couldn't resist an excuse to go pen shopping. I've found that Papermate InkJoy gel pens work really well for drawing the patterns and I use Staedler Triplus Fineliners for colouring them in.My only attempt at layered patterns so farI hadn't really thought about using the patterns for colouring before but it's fun - even if some of the shapes are ridiculously intricate. Should you be wondering (and I only know because I looked it up), the grown-up name for Spirograph patterns is hypotrochoid or epitrochoid patterns. The ones you do inside the ring are the hypotrochoids and the outside ones are epitrochoids. So now you know.Anyway, back to the crochet. No danger of your pen slipping with these. The crochet part is pretty basic really - a few rounds to get to the right size, then a round of eyelets to take the weaving yarn. I finished them off with a nice crab stitch border, not that you can really see that here.You'll have to take my word for it when I tell you that it gives them a fluted edge, reminiscent of jam tarts (or maybe that's just me). The patterns range from simple ...... to the slightly more complicated.Now I got a bit carried away with this whole project and ended up making 24 of these little things - three each of the eight designs I came up with. You may be wondering what on earth I'm going to do with them all. Well, I've made a little mat with seven of them and two lots of bunting.Oh yes, and I made a big one too, with 24 holes instead of 12; I particularly like that one. Now it may be that I'm the only person who wants to make this sort of thing but - just in case I'm not - I've turned this whole adventure into a very long pattern and you can download it here. I've included instructions for the eight patterns I did but you could design your own too. What with these and my venture into knitted stones recently, I think it might be time for me to design something a bit more practical. I do enjoy working on the weird stuff though.Mandala Stones"},
{"title": "Trees and Snowdrops", "date": "Friday 23 February 2018", "text": "After days of greyness and rain, last Thursday was bright and clear which was just as well as I'd planned a visit to Batsford Arboretum. I go for a walk there several times a year and there's always something exciting to see. At the moment it's the snowdrops' turn to take centre stage.There were carpets of them everywhere, between the trees and along the streams.They may be tiny flowers but seeing the first snowdrops is always exciting, a sign that Spring will indeed come.The arboretum is set on a hill so it can be steep and muddy walking but there are lots of things to chance upon. This little waterfall for example.The path runs nearly through it so you have to move quickly to avoid getting wet. Then, right at the top of the arboretum, there's a cave.I always think that the Swallows and Amazons would have made very good use of this. They'd have had a fire lit and broken open the pemmican as soon as they found it.There are two rather special trees that I always visit at Batsford, both with historical connections. The first is this one.I know it doesn't look particularly exciting at the moment but this is the Anne Frank tree. During her years in hiding from the Nazis, one of the few links with the outside world was the chestnut tree that she could see from her window. She watched it through the seasons and wrote about it several times in her diary.13th May 1944. 'Our chestnut tree is in full blossom. It is covered with leaves and is even more beautiful than last year.'Anne's tree blew down in 2010 but chestnuts from it had been planted and the resulting seedlings were sent to schools and other organisations around the world. This one was planted at the arboretum by the Girl Guides who were celebrating their centenary that year. It stands on the edge of this field, with a herd of red deer for company.Further up the hill stands this not very exciting Cypress Tree.But this is another tree with a story. In November 1852 an Eton schoolboy was among the crowds in London watching the funeral procession of the Duke of Wellington. A cone fell from a wreath which the boy picked up and later planted at his home in Hampshire. A cutting from the tree he grew was sent to Brayfield in Buckinghamshire. Then, just over a hundred years after Wellington's death, a cutting from this second tree was planted at Batsford. Which makes this tree the great-grandchild of the funeral wreath. I wonder how many people have picked up cones to grow the next generation of Wellington's tree.The arboretum is part of the Batsford Estate, based around this rather fine house.This is perhaps best known as the home of the infamous Mitfords, although they sold the house after the First World War. This is the view down towards the house from the top of the hill. On the other side of the house is this rather peaceful lake (complete with a duck house on the island).Sometimes there are black swans swimming on the lake but there were none to be seen this time.If there's one thing I love, it's a picnic and the spot I found for my lunch had a beautiful view.I have no idea what I was looking at but there was certainly a lot of it. It was so good to just sit and breathe in all that green-ness, even if it was a bit cold. My trusty flask of tea was much needed.Next time I visit it will be warmer and maybe the Magnolias which are in bud now will be blossoming."},
{"title": "Patterns from the Past", "date": "Sunday 18 February 2018", "text": "I've collected old knitting patterns for years. They're a good way to combine a love of social history and craft, as well as still being ridiculously cheap. Only a few days ago I added two beautiful baby patterns to my collection which cost me all of 50p. Charity shops are the best places to find vintage patterns; the really old ones are normally buried at the bottom of a box of more modern patterns and are often much cheaper than the new ones.Anyway, I thought it would be a good idea to take photos of some of my collections and share them here. Most of them are in these three old suitcases (apologies for the poor quality photograph - they're in a dark corner).As you can see, they're being guarded by my knitted Teddy Bear and Ferdinand the wooden sheep. He was carved for me by my daughter; he has a lamb but it's fallen down the back of the bookcase and I haven't got round to moving everything to rescue it yet. By the way, that's me in the photo on top of the suitcases, aged about six with our lovely dog Buster.It turns out that it takes a long time sorting through and photographing old knitting patterns so I think this is going to have to be the first of a series of posts. Let's open the smallest suitcase first.On the top are my Stitchcraft booklets. These were published by Patons & Baldwins and I should think they date from the 1950s. They are all collections of patterns for babies and children.Aren't the covers wonderful? Just look at the baby in the pink dress, beaming happily. And what about the two children on the cover of the Nursery Knitting Book?Children still enjoy blowing bubbles but they don't use proper little pipes like those nowadays. Inside this book, there's a lovely pattern for Norwegian style hat, scarf, glove and mittens which would look just as good today.Here are some more P&B booklets, including some of the 'First Woollies' series and some 'Beehive Baby Books'.These two patterns from the red Beehive Baby Book (SC14, price 1/6) show what would have been old and new style patterns at the time of publication.First there's a pram blanket knitted with Patons Double Quick Knitting and edged with ribbon. Most of the other patterns in the book use thin baby wool, 2, 3 or 4 ply, so this was definitely a bit different. Worked in a cable stitch pattern, it would have been nice and warm.The baby on the other page is wearing a ribbed vest and pilch, described as a 'Basic for Babies' set. This is much more traditional knitting, worked in thin yarn. In case you're wondering, a pilch was a knitted cover to go over the top of the nappy - patterns for these were as common as those for vests and booties.A couple more Stitchcraft booklets ...'Schooldays' and - with apologies to all the men who knit - 'He-knits that she knits'. The back covers of these two are good as well.This is the back of 'Schooldays'. I know this is what we would now think of as a teenager dressed as a middle aged woman but the clothes themselves are beautifully designed. Here's the back of 'He-knits' ...Nothing quite like the smile of someone who knows he's got someone to knit his jumpers for him. The only surprising thing about this picture is that neither of them is holding a pipe. Men with pipes feature a lot in old knitting patterns - \"I may be a knitwear model but look, I smoke a pipe like a real man\". Underneath the booklets are two big piles of mostly single knitting patterns. They're all either Bestway or Weldons patterns.These are small patterns, about 8 x 5\" or so, the older ones in black & white, the more recent ones in colour. I think they're all pre - decimal which dates them to before 1971. What shall we start with? I think the Bestway Booklets at the top of the picture.'Gloves and Mitts for the Family' has patterns for everyone and every season. Those were the days when a lady never went out without her gloves, even if they were lacy ones for warm days.The booklet on the right, 'Fair Isle Motifs for Childrens' Woollies' comes complete with charts ...... while you'll be glad to see that the boys in 'Boys' Knitwear' aren't letting standards slip. They may be hanging round on a street corner, but they're still wearing their ties.The individual Bestway patterns are for everyone and every occasion. Naturally, there are lots of baby patterns. I especially like the one with the baby in pink, I think it's the combination of colours - pink, turquoise, lemon and lime green - I'd like to knit something with all those colours in. There are also a few patterns for bonnets and booties.When my first baby was born in the 1980s baby bonnets were still called 'helmets' if they were for baby boys - so much more macho. There are lots of cardigans and slipovers or waistcoats in the childrens's patterns; most of the models don't exactly looked relaxed.But when it comes to artificiality, you've got to go a long way to beat some of the women on the Bestway patterns.The one in yellow is definitely smiling through gritted teeth. The hairstyles are pretty tortuous too. As for the men ... as promised, a man with a pipe.You can see the styling starting to relax a bit between these two family patterns.The man and boy in the pattern on the right may still be wearing their ties but at least their jumpers are a bit more casual. This is one of the few patterns to use chunky yarn which would have seemed very thick to a generation of knitters used to working with thin 4 ply yarn.There are a lot of old sock patterns around, like this one for schoolboy socks. I think the stripes on the socks would have been worked in school uniform colours. The other pattern above is for bedsocks, sized for children and adults and in various styles. I think the knee length ones are probably tube socks, knitted with a spiral rib pattern that means they don't need any heel shaping. My old house is always cold, I could do with a pair of those ...There are several patterns for gloves and mittens - can you spot another pipe? I think the mittens on the right are great (slip stitch, by the look of it). You could knit those for a child now and they'd look just as good as when they were first published.What else is there in the Bestway pile? Oh yes, a few elegant ladies in black and white.I do like a nice bedjacket pattern. One day I'm going to knit a bedjacket. If you live in a warmer house than mine you could always wear one over a summer dress on cool evenings.This is one of my favourite patterns.It's an outfit for dolls in three sizes - 12, 14 and 16\". I think this would fit my original Tiny Tears who I've had for over 50 years, not to mention the original Teeny Tiny Tears that I haven't got but hope to find one day.There are several patterns for string bags and a few collections of tea cosies. I do like tea cosies.And finally, I was struck by these two patterns. I wonder if that's the same little girl and, if so, where she is now?I've probably got fewer Weldons patterns than Bestways but I think they're my favourites. There's something about their design that I absolutely love. Just look at these womens' patterns.These models look alive in a way that the Bestway ones rarely do. And isn't that green jacket wonderful? Or how about these hats?I think all of these look stylish and appealing. Do you think the woman in the Fair Isle set is trying to explain colour photography to her Black & White colleagues? If so, I'm not sure the one in the fuzzy bonnet is quite getting it.My Weldons baby patterns look more dated but the designs are still interesting. Batwing baby cardigans anyone? I used to knit those for babies as these were easy to get their arms in and out of.The children's patterns are lovely too. That 'Windcheater Pullover' at the top looks very practical (I remember when a certain style of jacket was called a Windcheater - wonderful name). And just look at the little girl in the yellow cardigan, now that's what I call a smile.I suppose it's in the nature of glove and sock patterns that they don't change much ...... and you'll be relieved to see that the men are still wearing their ties and holding their pipes.There are just two more Weldons patterns to show you and these are amongst my favourites. First there's this penguin tea cosy. What do you mean, you don't feel the need for a penguin tea cosy?And then there's this ...Yes, that's right, it's called 'Television Knitting, Designed to Knit while you Watch'. There are four patterns: for a bedjacket, a zip up jumper, a short sleeved jumper and a blanket. Just in case you didn't get the point, each picture is framed by a television screen. Now I know I'm laughing at this but look at that blanket. Is it just me or is it very like my Pathways blanket? They say there's nothing new under the sun.I bet you're thinking we've got to the bottom of that suitcase now but you don't get off that lightly. There's one more pile to show you before you're allowed to go and make a cup of tea. This is my collection of Woolcraft magazines, a publication which went through many editions during the 20th century. My earliest copy is the 8th edition which dates from the early 1930s and my most recent is the 17th edition from 1962.Inside the 8th edition I found a torn out page from an engagements calendar for July 1937 on which someone had written a pattern for a knitted skirt.It's 31\" long and sized to fit someone with 40 - 41\" hips. It's called 'Ribbed Skirt' and is knitted with 16 oz 4 ply Excelsior wool and a number 9 circular needle. A circular needle in 1937? I thought they were much more recent than that. Wouldn't it be fun to knit this and see yow it worked out? 440 stitches though ...For many years, all editions of Woolcrafts had a full page illustration for each section. Here's the one for the baby patterns from this one.By 1962, those illustrations had been replaced with a more modern look.But my copy of the 16th edition of 1956 still looks quite like the early editions.Funnily enough though, my 1962 Woolcraft does have something in common with my edition from 30 years earlier ...Not a knitting pattern this time but the details of the various pullovers knitted. David's was in lemon 3 ply (maybe that's the wool used to tie the page to the book), Simon and Andrew's were in maroon and Ian and Katie's were in gold. The knitter has made notes of the number of stitches for each part and the individual measurements. I love finding things like this.While I think about it, I found this book a useful source for information about the Woolcraft magazines. In fact, it's pretty much essential reading for anyone interested in the story of knitting.This is the late Richard Rutt's A History of Hand Knitting, first published in 1987 and now sadly out of print. If you can find a secondhand copy, do buy it - it's an absolutely brilliant book. As well as masses of interesting historical detail about knitting, it's worth buying just for the appendices alone which include a list of publication dates for the Victorian 'Weldon's Practical Knitter' (another one of my collections) and a copy of the earliest known knitting pattern (it's a sock pattern in case you were wondering).If you want to read more about old knitting patterns while you drink that cup of tea (yes, I've nearly finished), I can recommend the blog Knitting Now and Then where Barbara writes interestingly about all aspects of historical knitting. I also found a flickr album of Bestway patterns complied by Lucy of the blog 1940s Style For You. You can browse through it here. I'm sure there are lots more resources out there; if you know of any others, do let me know by leaving a comment below.And now I'd better put all those patterns away again."},
{"title": "Hearts", "date": "Wednesday 14 February 2018", "text": "I don't really 'do' Valentine's Day. Well, to be truthful, I don't do it at all. But I know lots of people do so, over the years, I've designed various heart patterns. I may not like the day but hearts are quite fun to design and another good chance to play with colours.My first attempt at a heart pattern was eight years ago (Blimey, that seems a long time - sometimes I forget how long I've been at this lark. Ten years this summer, should you be wondering). Anyway, Folk Hearts are simple knitted hearts with a crochet edging.That's right, crochet in a knitting pattern. I never mix the two now; there are too many people out there who only knit or crochet, not both and I've found a little bit of another craft puts them off. But I didn't know that then and I think the crochet edges look nice. They also hide any uneven edges which is always good. Notice the buttons I've used to decorate these simple hearts. I am very partial to buttons and will use them to decorate anything that stays still long enough. As we shall see ...A couple of years later and my heart making skills had developed a bit to allow for a knitted border that's part of the main knitting. I'm still pleased with  Framed Hearts; they're simple and clean looking and I really like that garter stitch frame.I developed the frame idea a bit further with my Button Quilt pattern which uses leftover sock yarn to knit little round shapes in a square frame that can be sewn together.You know, I really like this pattern. I must fish my quilt out and add some more buttons to it. I've still got an awful lot of odds and ends of sock yarn lying about.But of course I couldn't resist decorating the framed hearts a bit. There were buttons and some embroidery ... oh, and a bit of felt too.There are an awful lot of crochet heart patterns out there so I haven't done much with crochet. It's easier to crochet a heart than to knit one because you can work them in the round, rather than having to knit several pieces and then sew them together.  I did sneak a few little hearts into this pattern though.  Hearts etc started out as a pattern for little bowls but then there were padded hearts, layered hearts - oh, and a few little, decorated mats too. Some of us just never know when to stop.It wasn't  until last year that I worked out a way of knitting hearts all in one piece. Hearts in a Hurry are knitted in garter stitch (possibly my favourite stitch of all) and they're very quick to knit. I really enjoyed designing these and had a lot of fun arranging them for photos.Aren't those colours lovely? I think my favourite patterns are always those with lots of bright colours like this. I'd like to say that I wasn't tempted to add anything to these hearts but that wouldn't quite be true.I haven't designed any more hearts since these, although a few did sneak into last year's February Mini Quilt,Maybe it's about time I did another hearts design? In the meantime, I'd love to hear if you've knitted (or crocheted) any of these patterns and what you used them for. Oh, and Happy Valentine's Day."},
{"title": "A little bit of everything", "date": "Wednesday 7 February 2018", "text": "Today was a working day and, with so many projects on the go at once, I decided to do a little bit of everything, sorting them out as I went. First of all, I finally cut out lots of small felt circles and started sewing them to the back of my crochet Spirograph circles that I showed you a while ago.There are rather a lot of them as you can see. I've made 24 (so far) with eight different patterns. As the backs are messy I'm going to back each of them with felt. This also makes the circles lie flat.  Then I'm going to string them together in various combinations ... I think. What puts me off simple sewing projects like this isn't the actual sewing but having to collect together all the bits and pieces; it took me ages just rooting out eight reels of thread in the right colours.  I've backed four so far so only another twenty to go. That big one at the bottom of the picture is an experiment with 24 holes round the edge rather than 12. I did it just for fun - I may or may not include it in the finished pattern. This project has turned out to be a lot of work and I suspect it will sink without trace when I finally publish it. Never mind, I like this sort of oddity even if nobody else does and it's been fun to do.The next two projects could both come under the 'winter warmers' heading - mittens and legwarmers. I've knitted a pair of basic red mittens, using a broken moss stitch pattern and now I'm starting on another pair which will be a bit different. The yarn and stitch pattern are the same but the second pair will have no thumbs and the top will curl to match the relaxed shape of a hand - go on, hold your hand up and you'll see what I mean. These were inspired by Elizabeth Zimmermann's jogger's mittens in Knitting Around. Hers are sewn together at the tip; I'm hoping to shape mine with short rows.As you can see, I've made a start on the second of my legwarmers too. These were going to be in shades of brown and gold but it looked too 1970s for me so I've used two close shades of red instead. I'm using a slip stitch pattern for these to make them extra warm (and because I love slip stitch).I've talked about my design for a traditional leaf blanket before. Well, I've tweaked my pattern a bit so I'm happier with it. The one on the left is the original, the one on the right is the new version. What do you think?The main difference is the eyelet section. I didn't like the original spacing so I've put them closer together and made the whole section bigger. I also made some complicated changes to the bells ... which are virtually invisible. Never mind, I know the pattern's better for them.My original notes were full of crossings out and re-writings so I typed them up. I'm knitting the next square from the typed draft so I can check the instructions as I go.I'm looking froward to having four squares done so that I can sew them together and see how the patterns look as part of a big block.All this sorting out of projects was starting to feel good so I pulled out two blankets that I started working on last year and which have been hiding since Christmas. First there was this box ...These are the blocks for what I'm going to call my Helicopter Blanket. This is another garter stitch design based on a Quilt block and yes, I know I haven't sewn the ends in - that's because I'm hoping to use them to sew the blocks together. Want to see what they're going to look like? Of course you do.It's meant to look three-dimensional; I think it does if you squint at it. Each block is made up of three identical shapes, each one knitted in a different colour. You pick up stitches for the second and third of the shapes so there's no sewing. So far I've finished 33 blocks; they're not very big so I need to knit a lot more. And no, I have no idea what shape the finished blanket is going to be (or what I'm going to do about the edges). I expect it'll come to me eventually.The other blanket project is what I call vanilla knitting. Simple garter stitch using lovely colours - the sort of thing that you can do when you're feeling a bit tired and fragile and anything else seems too difficult.Aren't they pretty? I think the shade of King Cole Riot I'm using is called Caribbean but I may use other shades as well. Now that I've found these blanket projects, I must get on with them.Before I go I wanted to show you the Dorset Buttons I made with a kit I got for Christmas (thank-you Pat). The kit was from Beaker Button and came with yarn, rings and instructions for five different designs.The blue buttons on the right were made with the yarns in the kit. For the others I used various yarns from 21st Century Yarns.Dorset Buttons were a thriving cottage industry, employing numerous families until the advent of the button making machine made their skills redundant. They're now popular with craftspeople and artists. You could use the basic technique to make giant circular wall hangings or just use the yarn you've knitted a cardigan in to make a set of perfectly matched buttons.There's lots of wonderful stuff on the Beaker Button site, including a tutorial for the most common type of button, the Crosswheel Button. All you need is a metal or plastic ring (a curtain ring is ideal), some thin yarn or embroidery cotton and a needle. I really enjoyed making my buttons and am going to order some more rings in different sizes so that I can experiment a bit more. I fancy turning some into jewellery.In the meantime, the basic weaving technique has found its way into another one of my projects (I'm so easily influenced).These are knitted Mandala Stones and yes, they are in fact stones with knitted covers. My daughter says one day she'll come home for a visit and find everything has been covered with knitted cosies. I enjoyed knitting these with odds and ends of sock yarn and then added a bit of Dorset Button style weaving to each one. I'll write this up as a pattern soon - just in case anyone else feels the need for some woolly stones in their life."},
{"title": "Special Books", "date": "Monday 22 January 2018", "text": "I nearly always read fiction on my Kindle nowadays as it's much easier on my eyes but I still buy real books where you need more than just the text - art books for example. Not having to worry where I'm going to find shelf room for all the fiction I read means I can indulge in these sorts of books without guilt.For Christmas I got two such books and they're both really beautiful as well as being great to read.The Secret Lives of Colour by Kassia St Clair is the story of 75 different colours, all with the most evocative names. Cerulean, Heliotrope, Dragon's Blood ... to name but a few. For me, heliotrope always conjures up the image of Maria Merryweather's governess Miss Heliotrope in Elizabeth Goudge's wonderful book The Little White Horse.I was particularly taken with the story of Scheele's Green which, because of its high arsenic content was responsible for many deaths, including Napoleon in exile on Saint Helena. Or how about Scarlet which originally meant a fine leather which took strong dye so well that it became associated with this particularly bright shade of red. Scarlet has been associated with martyrdom, the military (in England) - both presumably because it was the colour of blood - but there are also numerous 'scarlet women' in literature, from the whore of Babylon to Hester Prynne in The Scarlet Letter and beyond.This is a beautifully produced book, as befits its subject. Those little coloured dots on the cover are slightly indented and then, when you open the book, you see this ...... colourful endpapers for a book on colour. All the colours are well indexed but each colour also has a wide band down the side of the page so you can just flick through the book, choosing a colour to read about.Add to this some interesting articles on the science and language of colour, as well as a glossary of other interesting colours that wouldn't fit in the book and you have the perfect book on colour.The second book, Year of Wonder by Radio 3's Clemency Burton-Hill is sub-titled 'Classical Music For Every Day' which is exactly what it gives you. For each day of the year there's a piece of music to listen to, along with a story or description of the piece chosen. For example, the music for 9th January is the Offertorio from Verdi's Requiem. This was sung by a choir of prisoners in Theresienstadt, the numbers gradually dwindling as they were deported to Auschwitz. Knowing that adds something to the experience of listening to the requiem. I particularly enjoyed the Adagio from Albinoni's Oboe Concerto in D minor on 17th January. I'd never even heard of him before; apparently he was the first composer to write solo oboe concertos. I'm looking forward to discovering lots more exciting music as the year goes on. This book sits well alongside the subscription to BBC Music Magazine that I bought with some Christmas money.Again, this is a lovely book. The hardback cover feels soft, like a subtle velvet. How do they do that? It makes it a pleasure to hold and read. So, all in all, two very special books and thank-you Stephen for getting them for me.I'll leave you with that oboe piece to listen to."},
{"title": "Woolly Plans", "date": "Wednesday 17 January 2018", "text": "I had a lovely time at Bicester Wools yesterday, choosing yarn for some of the many designs I've got in my head at the moment. This year I'm trying to only work three days a week - Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. So far it's going well, although it's a bit strange not to be working all the time, especially in the evenings.I do seem to have got my enthusiasm for designing back though; I've got masses of new ideas and am desperate to get to work on them. Which brings me back to my yarn shopping.This is a selection of what I bought. The red at the back is destined to be turned into two related but not-quite-the-same mitten patterns. The brown is some more Stylecraft Special DK which, with a few other colours, will be some slip stitch legwarmers. Yes, I know it's not the 1980s, although I was very keen on legwarmers back then ... The variegated blue and green is a big ball of DK weight sock yarn as I thought I would work out a pattern for some thicker socks. It's freezing here as I type (even with a cat sprawled across my lap) so these seem like a good idea.So that leaves me with two more lots of yarn. First of all, that cream at the back ... I know it doesn't look very exciting but it feels great. It's Rowan Wool Cotton which is 50% wool and 50% cotton (just in case you didn't guess from the name). The bad news is that Rowan have discontinued this yarn, the good news is that it's in the sale at Bicester Wools so I bought eight balls. Want to see what I'm going to knit with it?Ever since I found a copy of Mary Thomas's Book of Knitting Patterns in a secondhand bookshop on a wet day in the Lake District about thirty or more years ago, I've been fascinated by the Garden Plot Square in the chapter on Medallion Knitting.It's a traditional leaf square, knitted in fine white cotton in the 19th century and used to make a blanket or counterpane. I always thought that, one day, I'd knit a blanket like this. What with my new 'only working three days a week' thing, I found myself with a free afternoon last week so I rooted out some old cream cotton (I don't knit with white ... or black, come to that) and had a go.Guess what? It's huge. I was using 4 ply yarn and the square came out at about 10\" which, given that you'd need four to make a block, would make each block 20\". I suspect that the original knitter would have used much finer cotton than mine but I didn't really want to go any thinner than my 4 ply. So, I decided to design my own leaf square, inspired by this one but smaller. I also changed the shaping as I didn't like the holes you got from increasing with a  yarn over at the start of rows. This is what I came up with.That's the square knitted from the original pattern on the left and my version on the right. I've kept the leaf, albeit a bit smaller, and the welts on the first half of the square but replaced the leaves in the centre with a panel of moss stitch.  I did want to include some more motifs though so I put in a section of bells, adapted from the stitch pattern in the same Mary Thomas book. My eyelet welts at the end are again an echo of the original, just with a bit more spacing between them. My square is about 6\" so four sewn together will be 12\". I'm planning to knit a small blanket, four squares wide and six squares long and then add some sort of border. I'll see if  I can find the inspiration for that in the book too. I may make a few more changes once I start knitting with the new yarn but I'm looking forward to making a start on this. The rest of the yarn in the basket (the pink, blue, yellow and cream) is going to be used with some other colours of Sirdar Country Style DK that I've already got. This is a lovely yarn and I've been using it for years but recently I've become disappointed with the range of colours. Nearly all my favourites have been discontinued and what's left is rather subdued and uninspiring. Anyway, this is what I'm using eight of my shades of Country Style for ...I know, crochet circles in pretty colours - so what's new? Well, if  you look closely, you'll see a ring of tiny holes on each circle; they show up on the yellow one. Those holes are there so that you can turn plain circles into something much more exciting.Aren't they good? I've been so excited about this idea and couldn't wait to put it into practice. Many late nights (and a lot of graph paper) later, I came up with eight different designs to embroider or weave on to the circles. It's a combination of both really, mostly embroidery but you do have to do a bit of weaving to make the patterns look continuous.I'm going to turn some into decorations and join others together to make a wall hanging or maybe a table runner. I wouldn't actually want anyone spilling tea on them though so maybe the wall's the best place for them.And yes, in case  you're thinking those patterns remind you of something, I did have one of the original Spirograph sets as a child in the 1960s and I loved it. I've just bought myself a new set to play with; there are so many lovely pens to use with it now and they don't make holes in the paper like the old biros used to. That's about it for now. If you're in the area, Bicester Wools has lots of reduced yarn and some really nice fabric in the sale too so do go and have a look. I bought some more fat quarters to make bags with. Which reminds me, I really must write up that pattern ..."},
{"title": "Secret Crafts", "date": "Tuesday 2 January 2018", "text": "Happy New Year everyone. I hope that 2018 turns out to be a peaceful one for you all, full of yarn and other good things.Now that all the presents have been unwrapped, I can share with you some of the things I made for other people last year. Every year I promise myself I'll make more of the presents I give and every year I run out of time. Having said that, I did quite well in 2017 as you'll see.I've been weaving on and off for a few years now (more off than on if I'm honest). My loom is an 12\" Ashford Knitters Loom  which is a small rigid heddle loom that folds up and can be stored in its own bag. I do hanker after a wider loom - perhaps a 24\" Kromski Harp - but for the moment I'm happy with what I've got.Anyway, I had a bit of a phase of weaving towards the end of last year and wove three scarves for presents.The pink and green one was woven with a ball of variegated sock yarn and the other one used three shades of Stylecraft Carnival Chunky. For this one I used each of the three colours in turn, both in the warp and weft, which gave a nice tweedy effect I think.The scarf I'm most pleased with though was the one I wove for my son's birthday in November. He loves bright colours so I decided to warp the loom with lots of rainbow shades. These are all odds and ends of Sirdar Country Style DK, one of the yarns I use a lot in my designs.How's that for a colourful warp? I didn't want to swamp all that colour when I started weaving so I chose a thinner sock yarn (about 400 m / 100 g) for the weft in charcoal grey. That meant that the colours still dominate the scarf, with the grey just holding it all together.I really enjoyed weaving this one, even if that thin warp made any missed threads very obvious (there was a fair bit of un-weaving when I got tired). Here's the finished scarf in all its glory ...I particularly like the colourful twisted fringe. My son was very pleased with his scarf and wears it all the time.I made two more scarves as presents (and yes, people do sometimes get presents that aren't scarves). These were crocheted with double ended Tunisian crochet hooks. I've talked about this technique before and I'm still very excited by its potential. Scarves with a different colour on each side!This one was made with aran weight yarns and the other one was two shades of Rico Creative Melange DK which I think worked especially well together.This scarf was for my brother. he wore it throughout Christmas and may even be wearing it to bed for all I know. I haven't liked to ask.One more Tunisian Crochet present, this time using a normal hook. I made this case for my daughter's mini iPad using three colours of the same yarn as my brother's scarf. This only took an evening or two to make and is a bit more secure than the sleeve she had for the iPad before. In case you're wondering, yes I did knit a few presents too (socks and gloves) but I haven't got photos of those.I also made a few of my reversible tote bags, including these two. A friend gave me a bundle of Christmas fat quarters earlier in the year so I turned them into bags.I'd been wanting to work out a pattern for a smaller version of my tote bag for a while now, one that could be made from two fat quarters of fabric, so this was an ideal opportunity. They turned out a decent size - 10\" tall, 9\" wide and 3\" deep - plenty big enough for your latest knitting project. I'm planning to turn them into a proper pattern so look out for that here.I really enjoyed making all these presents so I'm hoping to do something similar again this year. Not scarves though, I think I need to branch out a bit.Before I go, a quick reminder that my 2018 Frankie's Blankie KAL has started on Ravelry. I published the first pattern yesterday, the rest will follow weekly throughout the year. There's lots of chat about it on my Ravelry group and you can buy the yarn from Wool Warehouse. They're very quick at sending out orders and you can get a 10% discount by quoting the code FRANKIE10 so what are you waiting for? Come and join in the fun."},
{"title": "Christmas is ...", "date": "Saturday 23 December 2017", "text": "... a time for givingChristmas 1966... a time for decorations... sometimes a time for snow1963... and always a time for family 1992In the middle of all the last minute preparations I try to pause to remember Christmases past and to look to the future. At this time of year I always think about my first Christmas as a single parent with a five year old and a toddler and I make a donation to Gingerbread, the charity that supports single parent families. Back in the early 1990s single parent families were still seen as 'not proper families' and I think that, all to often, this is still the case. So, to all those celebrating Christmas on your own with children this year, I wish you a very Merry Christmas ... oh and try to take some pictures. It took me ages to find one with both children in (and sitting still).My apologies to those in the above pictures but it's a Christmas tradition to embarrass your nearest and dearest with old photos. And in case you're wondering, that's me with my new doll's house and also in the snow."},
{"title": "Puffballs", "date": "Tuesday 12 December 2017", "text": "I've been playing around with crochet puff stitches recently (as you do) and I came up with this little flower pincushion.Now it's quite nice but the bit I really enjoyed was the domed top with all those puff stitches. So I dived into my pile of Stylecraft Special DK and pulled out some rainbow colours (I know, I'm so predictable) and came up with this ...It's a rainbow puffball, isn't it nice? The trickiest part was working out how to join the two halves invisibly; in the end just sewing them together with a sort of mattress stitch did the trick. There are seven rounds in each puffball, one for each colour of the rainbow so, naturally, I got a bit carried away and made seven of them, starting each one with a different colour.Each ball is about 5 cm in diameter so they're just the right size for babies or for juggling. Or ... you could crochet a hanging cord and use them as Christmas baubles. Tolly cat finds they'r just right for practising his pawball skills. He's getting quite good at that, although what looks like clever tricks may just be him getting his claws caught in the ball.As ever, you can download the free pattern from my Ravelry page. There's still time to make one or two (or seven) for Christmas.Let me know if you'd like me to turn the pincushion into a pattern too."},
{"title": "A Year of Mini Quilts", "date": "Friday 1 December 2017", "text": "Today sees the publication of the last pattern in my 2017 series of mini knitted quilts. It all began back on January 1st with this little snowman ...January Quilt... and then carried on each month. In the season of April showers there was little girl ...April Quilt... and the start of the school year was marked with this one ...September QuiltEach little quilt is about the size of a postcard and you can hang them up or incorporate them into other projects. There are some lovely calendar blankets in the pipeline which I'm looking forward to seeing. Maybe I'll be able to share some photos of them here next year.So, I felt December's quilt should have a Christmas theme but I didn't want to do yet another Christmas Tree pattern (I've done more than my fair share of those). In the end I took my inspiration from old-fashioned tree baubles and came up with this ...December QuiltI'm particularly fond of the one with the sunburst embroidery.  All twelve of the mini quilt patterns are free to download on Ravelry. As ever, if you like them, do think about donating to the charity I support, The Children's Liver Disease Foundation through my fundraising page. I know a lot of people donate to charity at this time of year so I hope you'll help me raise even more money for this very worthwhile cause - over £16,000 and counting so far!My little quilts have been hanging in turn from the handle on my bread bin all year ... which has been a bit awkward every time I want to get at the bread. I should really choose a more practical place for next year.As well as knitting a little quilt each month this year, I've also been making matching fabric quilts and sending them to my daughter. I think she had to wait a week or so for one but, other than that, I've managed to send them off for the start of each month. I've tried to make them copies of the knitted designs but sometimes this works better than others. This month though I think the fabric quilt is as good as (perhaps even better) than the knitted version. What do you think?I like the embroidery with the gold thread, even if it is a pain to sew with. Those little gold things that look like bats are actually meant to be angels.I hope everyone taking part has enjoyed knitting and displaying their little quilts. If you didn't finish them all this year you can always catch up in 2018. There's still lots of knitalong fun to be had though. My Advent series of patterns is underway now with the first decoration for the Tree Sampler and, in the New Year, the adventure of Frankie's Blankie will start. Happy Knitting!Tree Sampler 1"},
{"title": "Frankie's Blankie", "date": "Saturday 25 November 2017", "text": "Well, what else do you call a blanket designed by Frankie? I'd like to introduce you to a special sampler blanket that I will be running as a KAL throughout 2018 - and actually into the first few weeks of January 2019 too.I see this project as a masterclass in knitting. There are 48 different squares to knit, each one featuring a different stitch pattern. Half the squares are worked in one colour using all sorts of techniques and patterns. The rest of the squares are knitted with both the main colour and a rainbow of other shades. These coloured squares all use slip stitch, possibly my favourite knitting technique of all. Just look at those colourful patterns in the picture above to get some idea of how versatile slip stitch can be.Some of the stitch patterns come from the Barbara Walker Treasuries, others are inventions of my own ... and then there are those which are a combination of both. By the time you've knitted Frankie's Blankie, not only will you have a lovely blanket to treasure but also a resource to refer to for future projects. When next you want an interesting pattern - for a scarf perhaps - you can choose a stitch pattern from your blanket.Speaking of scarves ... should you not want to knit a blanket, the individual patterns could be used in other ways. How about a sampler scarf or shawl? For each of the 48 squares I give details of how to knit different widths using the stitch pattern and I also tell you if that pattern will lie flat and whether it looks good on both sides. All particularly useful for scarf knitting.The yarn I've used for this blanket is Stylecraft Batik DK. This is a lovely soft yarn which has a subtle flecked look, reminiscent of hand-dyed yarn but is very reasonably priced. To complete the blanket you will need to buy 600 g (12 balls) of the main shade (Biscuit, 1901) and one 50 g ball in each of the following ten colours:Cherry          1904Coral            1903Pistachio      1910Olive            1911Sage             1908Storm           1913Teal              1909Violet           1912Plum            1907Raspberry    1905The colours are changed every four rows or so (it varies), giving a rainbow effect. This will give you lots of ends to darn in but slip stitch makes quite a thick fabric so there’s plenty of room to hide them. If you would prefer to use only one contrast colour per square, I would suggest buying eight colours and working three squares with each. Be warned though, if you do this, I can't guarantee that you will have enough yarn for the edging which rather eats up yarn.I bought my yarn from Wool Warehouse and I can recommend them wholeheartedly. They offer a very quick service, their yarn comes packed in useful drawstring bags and, best of all, you get a special discount. Just quote the code FRANKIE10 at the checkout to get 10 % off your blanket order. Within the UK the postage will be free as it's over £25, details of their International shipping rates are on their website. Rates vary between countries but there's a particularly good deal for customers from the US as they will send a package up to 2 kg in weight (which would cover all the yarn for the blanket) for just £2.99. You've got plenty of time to buy your yarn now before the KAL starts next year. The first pattern will be published on January 1st. the second on the 8th, the third on the 15th and the fourth on the 22nd of the same month. There will be four patterns published each month for the rest of the year, always beginning on the first of the month with the other three being published at weekly intervals. I hope that makes sense. This will give you a slightly longer gap between patterns at the end of each month to catch up and to sew the squares together as you go.So, by the end of 2018, you will have knitted 48 squares and sewn them together. Then there are two more patterns to complete the series, first for a knitted on border and then a colourful edging that really brings the whole thing together. These two patterns will be published in January 2019 - which seems a ridiculously long time away at the moment.I'm particularly proud of this knitted edging which looks just like crochet. It takes ages to do but it's the last of the 50 patterns so there's no rush to get it done.I'm really excited about this project and look forward to lots of you knitting it together next year. We will be chatting, comparing notes and generally admiring each others work on my Frankie's Knitted Stuff ravelry group so do come and join in the fun. It's going to be a wonderful year."},
{"title": "Two Artists", "date": "Monday 20 November 2017", "text": "If you could choose these things, I would love to have been an artist. Given that I can't draw and even copying takes me ages, I have to content myself with admiring others' work. Recently I've had encounters with two illustrators' work which have both delighted and inspired me.The first one was Clara Vulliamy who has illustrated many classic children's books, as well as the wonderful Dixie o'Day series written by her mother Shirley Hughes. Clara is also responsible for bringing Mary Plain back to life in new editions of some of the classic books by the Welsh author Gwynedd Rae. The first of the Mary Plain books was published in 1930 and generations of children have loved this independent and willful little bear. In my family my Mother, myself and my daughter have each in turn relished her adventures. I remember liking the fact that she was a real bear, rather than a teddy bear and I think I also identified with her confident, self-importance! Here she is, watching the kettle boil. As ever, she's very interested in everything.Mary also has her own special way of writing, mixing pictures and words. Here's the message on the cover of one of the new books.Isn't it good? This inspired me to write like this when I first read the books; perhaps I'll do that again. How about some picture messages in the next knitting pattern? That would certainly make them more interesting.Anyway, Clara did her first Mary Plain event in Wantage a few weeks ago and my daughter and I, lured by promises of cake and rosettes, decided that this was something we had to go to. We were in fact the only adults present without children but who cares? It was lovely to meet Clara in person, having chatted to her on twitter and the afternoon was wonderful.She introduced Mary to us, drawing the characters as she talked. This was probably my favourite part of her talk - watching an artist drawing is so exciting - and then we had a go at drawing Mary for ourselves. All I can say is that mine turned out with short legs, slightly dislocated from her body. It was fun though. Clara had made special Mary Plain rosettes as rewards for good drawing; some of the older children didn't put theirs on but we wore ours proudly for the rest of the day.My new books and the all-important rosetteClara spent a long time signing books and chatting after the talk. We just about managed to let the children go first before monopolising her for the rest of the time. As well as our new Mary Plain books, we'd taken some old favourites for her to sign and my daughter wanted to give her this special present. A little wooden Mary Plain she'd carved for her, complete with her own label in picture writing.It was such a good day.The other artist I want to talk about is Quentin Blake who has illustrated many, many excellent children's books. I saw an exhibition of his work at Compton Verney recently and it made me realise just how many of his books we've enjoyed over the years. Perhaps the best part of the exhibition for me were the two films of him working in his studio. Again, seeing an artist draw was magical and it was fascinating to see how he builds up the illustrations and shapes them with the text. One of the books he talked about was actually a wordless story Clown which tells of a toy clown thrown in the dustbin with other toys.Clown manages to climb out of the bin and sets off in search of a new home and to rescue the other toys (don't worry, it has a happy ending).Quentin Blake draws with pen and then adds the watercolours - working quickly and not worrying about keeping in the lines. this was a revelation to me - who knew you could do that?These glimpses of artists at work have inspired me to do more drawing. Clara was very encouraging about it being all right to copy drawings to learn how to do them. I'm not the only one who feels like this - look at the birthday card my daughter drew for me ...So, I used some birthday money to buy myself  a book by Peggy Dean called 'Botanical Line Drawing: 200 Step-by-Step Flowers, Leaves, Cacti, Succulents and Other Items Found in Nature'.This is a brilliant book; it's basically a workbook with step by step drawings for you to copy. I've been having a lot of fun practising some basic leaves.The book has spaces for your drawings but that was far too scary for me (also, draw in a book? not me) so I've been using my little sketch book. This gives me room to try each leaf lots of times which is just as well.I did buy some drawing pens but haven't been brave enough to use them yet. Perhaps when I've got a bit more confident. I'm really enjoying trying my hand at this. When I was at school, art was only for those who were really good at it so it's only recently that I've realised that, although I may not be naturally good at it, it's a skill that can at least be improved by practice. It's funny really that there's a general feeling that learning to play a musical instrument is within most people's reach but not learning to draw.That's enough arty thoughts for today. In my next post I'll be revealing my big knitting project for next year. I've been working on it for months and it's the biggest series of patterns I've written so I hope you're all suitably excited."},
{"title": "Tree Sampler", "date": "Tuesday 14 November 2017", "text": "For some years now I've been designing a big pattern for Christmas and publishing it daily throughout December as a sort of advent calendar. It's a good opportunity to work on projects that are too complicated to fit into one pattern and I really enjoy all the chat and companionship about the patterns on my Ravelry group each year.It all started back in 2011 with the Advent Garland.24 miniature knitted decorations to hang up one day at a time. This was the pattern that taught me that English Christmas traditions are not universal when knitters from the US kept asking me what the little knitted cracker was. This led to a lively discussion on my group, ranging from postboxes and robins to the exact purpose of sprouts.Since then there have been several three dimensional Christmas projects: a Gingerbread House, a Christmas Tree and, last year, a Christmas room.Gingerbread HouseNeedle TreeThe Night Before ChristmasThis year's pattern is decidedly more modest - simpler to knit and only 21 rather than the normal 24 December patterns. Inspired by clean and uncluttered Swedish design, Tree Sampler is a wall hanging made up of 21 small Christmas trees. Each one is decorated with a different stitch pattern, worked in red and cream yarn. You can see why it had to be 21 patterns, can't you?So far I've only published the pattern for the basic green trees. You have to knit 42 of these so the idea is to get them ready in November and then there will only be the little decorated panels to knit each day in December. In case you're wondering, there are 42 trees because they need to be sewn together in pairs to make them sturdy enough to keep their shape. I only realised this at the last minute ... turns out you can knit 21 Christmas trees in two days but I wouldn't recommend it.I like the overall look of this one and have to confess that I'm rather fond of the back too.It's so orderly and I like the negative spaces. As it's such a simple design, you don't need to buy lots of materials for this project (I thought everyone deserved a break from all that plastic canvas of the last few years). All you need for the Tree Sampler is some green and brown DK weight yarn and thinner 4 ply yarn in red and cream. Oh, and 21 little red buttons to sew on to the tops of the trees, together with some green sewing thread.The nice thing about choosing stitch patterns for such small pieces of knitting is that even the trickier techniques like Fair Isle that knitters may normally avoid are quite manageable. Any of the individual trees could be used as hanging decorations and I've also included instructions for knitting a little pocket to hold a chocolate should you want to knit an Advent Calendar.The first of the decoration patterns will be published on Ravelry on 1st December and the others will follow daily after that. I can't wait to see how everyone gets on with this project. If you're not there all ready, do come and join my group Frankie's Knitted Stuff where there'll be lots of Christmas chat around the pattern.As ever with my patterns, if you enjoy them do think about donating to my fundraising page for the Children's Liver Disease Foundation. You can do this from any of the pattern pages on ravelry or by clicking on the pink 'Frankie's Fundraising' button at the side of the blog.As the song says ..."},
{"title": "And I'm Back", "date": "Thursday 9 November 2017", "text": "After many many months of work, I'm glad to say that I've finally finished the mammoth series of patterns I've been working on for next year. The first pattern will be published on January 1st but I shall be telling you all about it later this month. On Tuesday I spent over 13 hours proofreading the whole thing for the last time, determined to get it done; it was a huge relief to print the last page and turn the computer off. For the last hour or so I was playing that fun game of 'will the ink cartridges run out before I've finished' but luckily they lasted until the end.So ... now that's done I can emerge blinking into the light and catch up with lots of other stuff. Like this blog for example. I have several posts in my head, just waiting for me to have time to write them. First of all, I wanted to tell you about my birthday a few weeks ago.Both my grown-up children were here for the day. I use the phrase 'grown-up' hesitantly as I'm not sure if I'm grown-up yet and, if I'm not, then how can they be? Anyway, this is where we went ...This is Compton Verney, a beautiful house with grounds landscaped by 'Capability' Brown which also happens to be a National Art gallery. It's in the middle of the countryside between here and Stratford-Upon-Avon and I've recently re-discovered how good it is.We went to see two exhibitions there - more of that later - and we also had a birthday picnic at a bench overlooking the lake. A small bird flew past us, close to the water and, when it dipped its wings (I assume it was some sort of birthday salute to me), we saw it was a kingfisher. These little birds are very beautiful, very fast and very tricky to see. It's only the third time I've seen one and the first time I've actually seen the bird rather than just catching a glimpse of blue out of the corner of my eye.There were two exhibitions on in the house that we wanted to see: The Lost Words and Quentin Blake: Inside Stories. I'll leave the Quentin Blake to another post but, after seeing the kingfisher, it seemed appropriate to talk about the other one here.The Lost Words is a beautiful and completely original book that's taking the book world here in the UK by storm at the moment. It's written by Robert Macfarlane and illustrated by Jackie Morris and is part poetry, part art book, part nature guide ... and so much more than that. The book was inspired by the rapid disappearance of words for natural things from children's vocabulary. If we have no word for something, how can we value it? So, 'The Lost Words' is a sumptuous book of spells, designed to be read aloud by children and adults to help conjure the words and the creatures and plants they describe back into view.The book itself is huge - you could fit four average sized paperback books on its cover - and it's a joy from start to finish. Each word has three page spreads: first there's a picture of the landscape as it would be without the thing being described, then there's a glorious painting of it, together with the spell and, finally, a picture of it restored to the natural world.For example, here are the 'before and after' paintings for the Starling ...... and here's the bird itself ...A photograph can't do these wonderful paintings justiceThe spell for the starling conjures up the glistening array of this bird's colours 'Should green-as-moss be mixed with blue-of-steel be mixed with gleam-of-gold' while also remembering its tendency to copy from us 'if you sampled sneaker-squeaks and car alarms and phone ringtones you'd still come nowhere near the Rooftap riprap stree-smart hip-hop of starling song'. These few lines give you some idea of how musical these spells are - they just cry to be read or even shouted out loud. I think there are lots of echoes of Gerard Manley Hopkins, the great Victorian nature poet here.In contrast to the long strings of words of the starling's spell, the magpie's is short and to the point.It begins 'Magpie Manifesto: Argue Every Toss! Gossip, Bicker, Yak and Snicker All Day Long!'You get the general idea. One more thing about these spells, they're also acrostics with the first letter of each line spelling out the word. This is a wonderful book, do go and find it if you can. I haven't spoken as much about the paintings as they're difficult to reproduce here; you need to see the book or, better still, go to the exhibition to appreciate them in all their glory.After all that excitement, I still had birthday presents to open. I'll just show you a few, mostly books again.New books on Jane Austen. I was ridiculed here when we re-arranged the books recently and they discovered just how many books about her I had but, nonetheless, these two arrived on my birthday. As you can see, I've started the textual criticism one already (note the use of my best bookmark) and it's really good. It's already had me pulling out some of my oldest editions to compare them with those mentioned.Would you believe that both of these - early twentieth century editions of 'Pride and Prejudice' and 'Northanger Abbey' & 'Persuasion' (these two in one volume) - were only a few pounds in charity shops? I bought them some time ago but, even so, that's got to be cheap.Both books feature illustrations by Hugh Thomson which are wonderful, if a little whimsical. From 'Pride and Prejudice' here's the start of the chapter after Mr Collins' proposal ...... and look at this one, ... Mr Bingley and a few cupids in a tug-of-war against the influence of his sisters and his friend.One of my favourite books as a child was Robert Louis Stevenson's A Child's Garden of Verses so I was delighted to be given this picture book version from 1951.It was illustrated by Alice & Martin Provensen, 20th Century American artists whose work I knew from this book, 'A Peaceable Kingdom: The Shaker Abecedarius'.Anyway, back to my 'The Child's Garden of Verses'. Here's the start of a poem I remember very well, I used to chant the opening lines out loud - yes, I was an odd child.I also got this beautiful new children's book, illustrated by one of my favourite modern artists, Karl James Mountford.Last Stop on the Reindeer Express is written by Maudie Powell-Tuck and tells the story of Mia's magical journey to deliver her Daddy's card in time for Christmas. The story is restrained and well written and the whole book is a beautiful to hold and explore, with cut-outs and rich colours throughout.I didn't just get books for my birthday though. Amongst other things, I got three new CDs to add to my collection.Two violin and one recorder. So far my favourites are the Tchaikovsky Violin Concerto in D major and Dvorak's Serenade for Strings. I heard this last piece at a concert given by the Adderbury Ensemble in a candlelit church just before Christmas last year and it was such a joyful experience. Here's a taste of it for you.That's all for now. I shall be back soon."},
{"title": "Making Progress", "date": "Monday 23 October 2017", "text": "Slowly but surely I'm ticking things off my never-ending to do list. First of all, for all my knitting followers, there's this ...I know it doesn't look very exciting but that red file contains all the patterns for this year's big Christmas series. Yes, it's finally finished - knitted, photographed, written, proofread (oh the proofreading, it took me five hours and several cups of tea) - and printed out for posterity.I do hope you'll like it. As I keep saying, it's a much simpler pattern than in previous years so I'm worried that it will be a disappointment. Still, simple means easier knitting so that's a bonus. Speaking of which, I'm also making good progress with various Christmas presents I'm making but of course I can't show them on here now or it will spoil the surprise.I still have to finish the patterns for the big KAL I've got planned for next year. I've written the first drafts but I'm struggling with the photos. If I can get those sorted, I'm hoping to announce this series in the middle of November with details of materials (and a special discount offer) but the first pattern won't be published until January.So, what else have I been making progress with? I spent quite a lot of time last week cleaning and sorting the kitchen and scullery. I may not be house proud (just as well really) but even I know it's time to clean the floor when your feet start to stick to it. That led to a turn out of all the cupboards and a mass migration of china.I love collecting bits and bobs of nice china from antique and charity shops - a cup and saucer here, a jug there  - but didn't have anywhere to keep them. So they were piled up around all the everyday stuff in the kitchen cupboards which made getting a plate out a chancy business. I do however have a big built-in cupboard in my bedroom. The house is more than a hundred years old and this is one of the original cupboards. It's less than a foot deep and would originally have been used for clothes (which just goes to show how many fewer clothes the Victorians had). Anyway, Paul the builder kindly filled the cupboard with shelves to take all that homeless china.This is about half the cupboard. It's not a very good picture but I had to lie on the bed to take it and then the camera kept wobbling. Anyway you get the general idea. Now the china has somewhere to live and I can get things out of the kitchen cupboards without risking an avalanche of broken crockery.Progress is also being made with the violin. I've been learning for a year now and I still love it. It's very hard work and frustrating at times but I can now play actual music, more or less in tune. This is what's on my stand at the moment ...... an interesting mixture of Harry Potter, Baroque and some pieces from Michael Rose's Sketchbook For Violin There are six pieces in this book, all of them lovely but each calling for a different bow technique. The Harry Potter music has some tricky combinations of notes and the Baroque is difficult but wonderful. The fact that I'm not doing music exams this time round means I can play all sorts of music, just for fun.One of the reasons I'm planning to cut down on the amount of work I do next year is to give myself more time for music. As well as the violin, I'd like to play my piano and recorder more and then there's the clarinet which has been neglected for decades. I wonder if I could even play it still? I'm also looking forward to designing more small patterns after working on so many big series this year. In the last couple of weeks I've been trying the new Stylecraft Batik Elements yarn. This is a DK weight variegated yarn and it's lovely and soft - nice to work with. With a couple of 50 g balls I knitted a textured cowl which I'm calling 'Elemental'.I enjoyed working on this. The wavy ripples are fun to knit and surprisingly easy; six out of the eight pattern rows are either knit or purl so you only have to really pay attention for the other two. If you'd like to knit one of these, the pattern is here Elemental. The colour I used is called Bismuth; I'm tempted to knit another one in Krypton which is a lovely green.I've also finished the knitted mini quilt for November. We're nearly at the end of this series of patterns now which I must admit will be a bit of a relief for me. I've come to the conclusion that deadlines don't really suit me. I am enjoying seeing everyone's little quilts on my Ravelry group though; I'm particularly looking forward to seeing the ones that are being turned into blankets. Would you like to see all the quilts so far?January - June...July - OctoberI don't know which is my favourite; it tends to be whichever I've just finished designing. I do like the snowman, but then there's the little Sunbonnet Sue with the umbrella and the pencils ... and all those flowers ... what do you think? Have you got a favourite?"},
{"title": "Getting into Practice", "date": "Saturday 7 October 2017", "text": "Next year I'm determined to turn what my family call my 'knitting empire' into a part-time empire so that I have time to do other things. Now that the end of my big projects is in sight (next year's KAL and the Christmas pattern will be done by the end of this month), I'm getting into practice for next year by getting out of the house occasionally. Apparently putting the bins out doesn't count!So far I've had a couple of good muddy walks, complete with picnics. I do love a picnic, whatever the weather - one of the many things I've inherited from my Granny. She would take all the grandchildren down to the forest for the day (the New Forest) and we would cook our picnic on a little primus stove. I remember holding the umbrella over her one day while she cooked so that the rain wouldn't put the stove out.Anyway, look who I met on a walk in the woods this week ...You'll have to look closely as he was very shy. We stood and looked at each other for nearly five minutes before he bounced back into the trees.I also managed to get to the Seurat to Riley exhibition at Compton Verney which was excellent. I saw so many clever ideas that I had to stop to buy a new pad of graph paper on the way home so that I could play about trying to turn them into something woolly. I've bought a season ticket for Compton Verney so I'm looking forward to lots more visits.I'm lucky to live a few miles from the village of Adderbury where the church hosts wonderful music from The Adderbury Ensemble and other top musicians. I went to the first concert of the Autumn season a few weeks ago which was so good. Tomorrow I'm going again, this time to hear the Tippett String Quartet I can really recommend the Music in Adderbury concerts; many of the musicians can also be heard at the Oxford Coffee Concerts.And now I've still got more than twenty patterns to write up ..."},
{"title": "This week I've finished ...", "date": "Monday 18 September 2017", "text": "...all the first drafts for the big pattern series for 2018. They're not great - the photos in particular leave a lot to be desired - but I feel I'm finally getting somewhere with this one. I do hope that it will be popular after all this work. It seemed like a great idea when I first came up with it but has occasioned much muttering of things like \"making a rod for my own back\" and \"too much work and no play\" for months now. I hope that by the time the first pattern is published on January 1st I shall have had time to decide I like it again.I've also finished ...... designing this year's Christmas pattern series. I've still got some knitting and assembly to do, as well as the photos and writing but it's starting to look good. As I keep saying, this year's pattern is much simpler and shorter than last year's. I decided I needed a break from complicated 3D designs and maybe you do too. There's your first clue Isolde!This was also the week I finally got this crochet blanket finished and published. It's called Paintbox and uses 30 lovely colours of the wonderful Stylecraft Special DK. This is a good quality acrylic yarn which is both reasonably priced and, most important of all to me, comes in a huge range of colours. I love the look of so many cheerful colours combined in this blanket. The texture is more evident than I thought it would be too which is good. All those ridges of colour are achieved by working into the back strand of each stitch only.While I think of it, did you know that Stylecraft Yarns have brought out three new shades of the Special DK?  I was lucky enough to win a ball of each in a giveaway on twitter recently and here they are ...From left to right, they are Lapis, Lincoln and Blush. It took me ages to decide which order to arrange them in for this photo. I wanted to put the blue in the middle to balance the colours but then that would leave the two new design ball bands next to each other ... me? obsessive? I don't know what you mean. I know for a fact that my daughter would have had just the same problem. Mind you, she is a professional list maker so there's no hope for her.I agree with Pat - Woolhelmina on ravelry - that the new shade of blue is particularly welcome. It definitely fills a gap. Oh, and I have to say I like the new ball bands.This is the first giveaway I've ever won, yet another reason to love twitter. Do come and say hello if you're there. I'm @MyKnittedStuff (Frankie's Knitted Stuff was too long for a twitter handle). Having thought I would use twitter to talk woolly stuff, I spend most of my time talking about books with a group of lovely people and admiring the art posted daily by Dr Liv Gibbs. I've discovered several new artists through the pictures she shares (Stanley Spencer for one); I think it's particularly clever how she often chooses art that is topical. When the new term of school started here in the UK she found paintings of children on their way to school for example. Don't be put off by all the stories about twitter trolls; yes they're horrible but you don't have to read them, you choose whose tweets you want to see and I've met some wonderful people through chatting there, many of them local to me.And now I must stop chatting and get on with some work."},
{"title": "Walking into the 12th Century", "date": "Thursday 7 September 2017", "text": "I'm still very busy designing (the Christmas project is coming along nicely, thank-you for asking) and most of the things I'm working on aren't ready to share yet so I thought I'd show you a walk my son and I did a few weeks ago. This is one of my favourite walks; it has everything - trees, water, history and, of course, lots of green everywhere.The walk starts from Burford, one of the most picturesque Cotswold towns and takes you across fields, through woods and past a farm ...... great sign, isn't it?We stopped for a picnic, saw a buzzard and I got stung by a wasp. Naturally, I made a lot of fuss about this. Why does a wasp sting feel nothing like a sting and more like being punched hard?One of the most beautiful parts of the walk is the wonderfully named Dean Bottom where we met these ladies ...At the end of that line of trees you get the first glimpse of the highlight of this walk.Yes, that's right,  it's a church in the middle of a field. It was once part of a medieval village but now stands alone. This is St Oswald's which dates from the 12th Century and was once part of Gloucestershire, despite being firmly within the county of Oxfordshire. Before going inside, we visit the grave of the Rector of my daughter's old college which we discovered our first time here. His epitaph reads 'A humanist, bon viveur and, above all, a wise and constant friend.' Anyway, would you like to see inside the church?It's a tiny building with early nineteenth century box pews, Roman mosaic underneath the flagstones and medieval wall paintings.You can read more about St Oswald's in this guide which also has lots more pictures; it's really interesting so do have a look. Despite the fact that the church is only accessible on foot, services are still held here once a month (Sunday Evensong, Easter to October).The rest of the walk could seem a bit of an anti-climax after that but luckily you walk alongside the River Windrush back into Burford which is lovely - I once saw a kingfisher here and always hope to see one again.I do this walk in all seasons and there's always something new to see. And now I must get back to work. I'll leave you with a glimpse of the crochet baby blanket I'm finishing off - pattern coming soon."},
{"title": "How to Knit a Granny Square", "date": "Tuesday 29 August 2017", "text": "I've tweaked the knitted Granny Square that I showed you last week and added a Granny Circle to go with it and you can now download the free pattern for them both from Ravelry. I had a lot of fun working on this design. For a start I got to play with rainbow colours and then there was the challenge of trying to do something that at first seemed impossible. How to knit something in the round that looked like crochet? As crochet works with one stitch at a time and knitting doesn't, this was tricky.It turned out that the answer was I cord. This is a way of knitting a thin tube on very few stitches, using double pointed needles. As the technique I developed meant that I would only have two or three stitches on my needles, I needed some nice short ones. The ones I went for were Knit Pro Zing 15 cm needles. These are sharp enough too find the spaces between the stitches but not so sharp that they split the yarn. Also - they come in lovely colours!You can see my needles here, along with the seven shades of Patons Diploma Gold DK that I used for this project. I have to say that it takes a lot longer to knit a Granny Square, rather than crochet it but I rather enjoyed it. The finished shapes are quite thick so would make good mats or coasters. Seven rounds of knitting will give you a 10 cm / 4\" mat.I love this sort of designing where I feel I'm doing something new and exciting - it helped that it was a quick project too. It made a nice change from all the big designs I'm working on at the moment.I hope you'll be tempted to have a go and knit your own Granny Square, why should the crocheters have all the fun?"},
{"title": "Quilt Show", "date": "Monday 28 August 2017", "text": "A couple of weeks ago I had my annual trip to the Festival of Quilts at the NEC in Birmingham. I've been going to this show for years, initially with my Mum who was a very good quilter and, lately, with my daughter and my knitting buddy Pat.We enjoyed out day but were to sad to see that the range of crafts represented was, yet again, narrower than before. Obviously, most of the exhibitors are linked to Patchwork and Quilting in some way but there always used to be a few good cross stitch stands, some general book stands and so on. We also thought there were less exhibitors from mainland Europe than before - maybe a result of Brexit. It would be a shame if they no longer felt they would be welcome here.Despite this we managed to find lots of good stuff to inspire us and plenty to spend our money on. We also met up with one of the regular members of my ravelry group for coffee - it was lovely to meet an online friend in real life.So, this is what I bought ...Where shall I start? The red spotty thing in the middle is a kit for a sewing bag from Dandelion Designs. It was quite expensive and will take me a while to make but it's lovely - shaped like a small suitcase and full of little details. Mandy Shaw is a prolific and very talented designer; we always like exploring her stall.I bought a Sizzix die and some clear, plastic templates ready to start on a Patchwork of the Crosses quilt, inspired by the quilt pieced by Lucy Boston, author of the Green Knowe books. I've talked about it before here but I'd really recommend this book if you're interested in her fantastically detailed quilts.I thought the plastic templates were particularly good. I bought them from Sew & Quilt and, as well as being clear so that you can position the template exactly where you want it on the fabric, they have the seam line marked and tiny holes at the corners and in the centre to take a pin to hold the template in place. I'll use my Sizzix machine to cut the papers and the templates for the fabric.Hiding away in the main picture is a little scissor keeper kit from Sue Hawkins which I'm looking forward to making. I don't even need another scissor keeper but Sue's designs are such fun to sew and the vibrant colours are lovely. Also, it's only a small kit so I might have a chance of actually finishing it quite soon. I can just hang it up and admire it when it's done.See those brightly coloured plastic shapes at the front of the picture? Now they're very exciting. I bought them from Tactile Treasures who sell all sorts of bits and bobs to add interest to children's toys and quilts. There are squeakers, rattles, crinkly paper and mirrors - all of which can be sewn into things and washed. I bought a selection to play with including some coloured teething shapes which are the things you can see. I'm wondering if I can incorporate some of them into knitted designs ...... speaking of which, as you can see I also managed to find some wool. I bought a ball of  James C Brett's new Stonewash DK which comes in some very nice, subtle colourways. The cream yarn at the back of the picture is very special. It's Superfine Alpaca 4 ply from UK Alpaca, a family farm in Devon. Now this yarn isn't cheap and I didn't need it but it's so soft! I could just imagine how wonderful it would be to knit with - sometimes the process of knitting is more important than the product. So I treated myself to four balls and plan to knit some sort of shawl or wrap. Of course I'm constitutionally unable to use a pattern I haven't designed myself so it will have to wait until inspiration strikes.In fact, all these lovely things are still sitting there, hopefully waiting for me to start using them. I keep looking at them longingly but there's still Too Much Knitting Work To Do! When it eases up a bit, I shall start one of these exciting new projects as a treat. Which one shall I do first, I wonder?"},
{"title": "Running fast ...", "date": "Monday 21 August 2017", "text": "... to stay still - that's what it feels like I'm doing at the moment. Other sayings that come to mind are 'All work and no play', 'Time flies', 'Bitten off more than you can chew' - you get the general idea.At the moment I'm working frantically on The Big Pattern Series for 2018 and wishing I'd never thought of it! I shall feel better once the knitting is finished and I can concentrate on the writing. As for this year's big Christmas pattern, every time I think of it I start to panic. Maybe I don't actually need to sleep?Calm down Frankie, deep breaths ... I have actually had a few days out in the past couple of weeks which I'd like to write about but, in the meantime, what do you think of this?This is what I was working on late last night and it's my first attempt at a knitted Granny Square. I need to try again with some bigger needles as it comes out very thick but I quite like the rippled outside edge. It takes a lot longer than a crochet one would but I think knitters who don't crochet might like it. Can anyone guess how it's knitted?"},
{"title": "A Long Look at a Small Bookcase", "date": "Wednesday 2 August 2017", "text": "This little bookcase lives in my hall and, during the great book sort last weekend, I decided to use it for some of my smaller collections of children's books. The bookcase itself is about seventy years old and was made by my Grandfather out of old packing cases. I have a workbox that was made in the same way.Anyway, back to the books. On the top shelf are my Ladybird Books; some are my original childhood books but most have been bought more recently.Since the 1940s Ladybird books have been popular and affordable small books for children. Printing each book on one large sheet of paper meant that quality books could be sold at reasonable prices.I loved this book as a child and used to pore over the pictures. Children's books with coloured illustrations like this were a real treat in the early 1960s.These two were mine as a child too. I like the picture of the school milk - those were the days.The next two are more recent acquisitions.I particularly love this one, it's just my sort of thing.And of course I had to have the Ladybird Book of Knitting.I think I may have to add to this collection soon. Books & Ink have lots of old Ladybirds, just waiting to tempt me.Next to the Ladybirds on the shelf are three small books.These are King Penguins, they were published in the 1940s and 50s and are a similar size to the Ladybirds. They're beautifully designed - just look at this one ...This is 'A Book of Toys' written and illustrated by Gwen White. Nearly all the toys pictured can be found in London museums so you could visit them and look for the originals.'Wild Flowers of the Chalk' by John GilmourThis last one is an amazing book. The maps are from John Speed's Atlas of 1627; it's fun to see how much (or little) counties you know have changed since then.On to the second shelf of the bookcase now. I expect these are familiar to most people - some of the Arthur Ransome series of 'Swallows and Amazons' books.I do like books with map endpapers - this one's from 'Picts and Martyrs'In this illustration from 'We Didn't Mean to Go to Sea' you can see the rescue of Sinbad, the ship's cat.I only read 'Swallows and Amazons' as a child (thank-you Puffin Story Books - more about those in another post) but have since read and re-read the whole series as well as sharing them with my two children. This led to an Arthur Ransome themed holiday in the Lake District where we climbed Kachenjunga and found the Dog's Home, as well as visiting Captain Flint's houseboat and picnicking at Darien. If none of this means anything to you, go and read the books - they're wonderful.Next to the Arthur Ransome are some non-fiction books. First, a few books from the Blackwell's Learning Library, school books from the 1960s and 70s.I like these for their social history as well as the illustrations. Here are a couple of pages from 'Edna Johnson's Summer Book', first published in 1963.In 'Dancing in Britain', as well as the expected references to Morris Dancing and Maypole, I also found this ...Scottish soldiers from the 51st Highland Division dancing in a German prisoner of war camp during the Second World War. The book says that they invented a new dance which is still called the Reel of the 51st Division.Next come these two books which I expect were also school books.These were published by the Blandford Press, I would guess in the 1950s. As you can see, I have yet to find Book 2 of the series. More lovely illustrations in these pages from the two books.The tiny little books at the end of this shelf are my collection of old I-Spy Books.Modern versions of these little books are still being published by Collins; the idea is to spot things around a theme. You get different numbers of points for each thing you spot, depending on how hard they are to find and, when you have enough points, you can send off for a certificate. You used to get a badge which I think was nicer but the books are still lots of fun.'I-Spy Wild Flowers''I-Spy History'Not that my house is full of old things but I have everything on that page from 'I-Spy History'!And now for the bottom shelf of the little bookcase.These are my Little Grey Rabbit books. I had just one of these as a child which I read and re-read, 'Wise Owl's Story'.I didn't know that it was part of a series so imagine my delight when, as an adult, I found that Alison Uttley had written more than 30 little books about Little Grey Rabbit and her friends. The stories are lovely, full of details of the countryside and they have the most beautiful pictures by Margaret Tempest.Here are just a few of my favourites ...Two books featuring Fuzzypeg the Hedgehog How wonderful is it that there's a book about making lace?I bought 'Little Grey Rabbit's Christmas' just last week and it's already one of my favourites. There's sledging and snowballs (Fuzzypeg gets stuck in one), carol singing, primrose wine and lots of kindness between neighbours. And we've finally got to the end of the bookcase. I hope you've enjoyed this look at some of my collections and that it's brought back happy memories of your own childhood books. I have more book collections on other bookcases, including hundreds of first edition Puffin Story Books and Green Penguins But they will have to wait for another day."},

The little flowers are quick to knit and could be used to decorate all manner of things Summery.It was a bit of a race to get this pattern ready as we spent the weekend sorting and moving all the books on the bottom two floors of the house into new homes. By which I mean new bookcases, not many actually left the house. When I can get some decent photos I'll show you what I mean."},
{"title": "New Things", "date": "Tuesday 18 July 2017", "text": "New thing number one:     Improvised RaddleA raddle is basically a long piece of wood with posts sticking up to spread the warp when warping a loom. Proper ones are silly prices so I tried this thing that I bought at Dunelm Mill some time ago. I can't remember what it's meant to be used for but I think I found it in the kitchen department. Anyway it only cost a couple of pounds and it worked. You could cut out the middle bars and use both sides next to each other for wider warps too.New thing number two:     Bobbin WinderThis one is the real thing, made by Ashford. Again, you can improvise with drills and suchlike but I decided to go for this one. I got fed up with always having to reload my stick shuttles when weaving with thin yarn so decided to try a boat shuttle. Which leads me to the next new thing.New thing number three:     Boat ShuttleThis is an 8\" shallow Swedish style boat shuttle, made by Bluster Bay and supplied by The Handweavers Studio. Here it is in action at the start of a new scarf. It's definitely quicker and easier to use than a stick shuttle. I bought some paper quills to go with it (these take the place of a bobbin) but I think I shall make my own too. I did read somewhere that you can use drinking straws ...See that stitched edge above the paper? That's my first attempt at hemstitching.New thing number four:     CurtainsThese aren't at all exciting but they took me three days to make and hang so I'm glad to have finished them. The windows are triple width - think of a bay window flattened - so I had to use two lengths for each curtain and then I lined them with blackout material (having discovered that you can get it in cream as well as black). The worst thing about making curtains for this house is adjusting the length. It's all very well measuring from the floor but my floors aren't level and nor are the windows. This time there was only a few inches difference from one side of the window to the other; when I made floor length curtains for the front room there was a 6\" height difference across the window.See that table in the corner? That's not at all new, being a Regency Card table from the early 19th Century but I only bought it last year. The top opens out to make a big square table, just right for cutting fabric on. I was looking for a desk to fit that alcove when I found this one at Brackley Antiques Centre for about the same price that a new table of that size would have been. I do love old things."},
{"title": "Margaret Murray & Jane Koster", "date": "Monday 10 July 2017", "text": "Today I thought you might like to see some of my old knitting books, published by Odhams Press in the middle of the 20th Century.These were all written by Margaret Murray and Jane Koster, sisters-in-law who started out running a child model agency and then became prolific knitting designers. As well as collaborating on knitting books, they also designed patterns for many of the big yarn houses of the day and were pioneers in the study of knitting history. I learnt all this from Richard Rutt's A History of Hand Knitting which, by the way, is a book that should be on every knitter's bookshelf.The Murray and Koster books all have very similar titles: 'Practical Knitting Illustrated', 'Modern Knitting Illustrated', 'Knitting Illustrated' ... you get the idea. They also all have lovely endpapers on a knitting theme.'one plain, one purl' - I like that oneBefore looking inside, here's a tip for dating these books. If you look at the line of text giving the printer's details (this is often at the very end of the book) you will see a short series of letters and numbers. The numbers give the month and year of printing.So, this book was printed in the tenth month of 1946 - October 1946.Although the books are of their time with lots of patterns for knitted vests and swimsuits, there are also many timeless designs that would be fun to try now.This shawl would not just be 'appreciated by the older woman' todayNot quite sure why she's reading with her gloves on but the pattern's niceI particularly like old patterns for baby clothes and isn't this spread beautifully designed?Many of the books have features on stitch patterns ...... and also some crochet patterns.Should you want to look for these lovely books, they often turn up in charity shops and secondhand bookshops or ... you could start your collection with one of my books.Owing to a combination of never having my list with me when I see these books and the titles being so similar, I have an extra copy of two of the Murray and Koster books.  The first one is 'Practical Family Knitting Illustrated', printed in 1946.This one is unusual in that it has colour illustrations. As you might guess from the title, there are 62 patterns for all the family, divided into four sections - one for each season. There's also a short chapter on the 'Principles of Knitting and Crochet' but no stitch patterns in this one. I couldn't find any crochet patterns either.The second book is 'Practical Knitting Illustrated' printed in 1940.As you can see, this one has the normal black and white illustrations. There are 75 designs, including some crochet patterns and a few toys and things for the home. There's also an excellent section at the back of the book with advice on adapting patterns for different shapes and sizes and quite a few stitch patterns too. I think this book has a better variety than the other one but of course those colour pictures are lovely.Anyway, if you would like one of these two books, just leave a comment at the end of this post, telling me which one you'd prefer. First come, first served and I'm afraid I can only send the books within the UK, owing to the cost of the postage. If, once they've got their books, the recipients would like to make a donation to my fundraising page for the Children's Liver Disease Foundation, then that would be very nice but is not compulsory.Let me know if you've enjoyed this post and would like to see more of my old knitting books. I have some that are about 170 years old ..."},
{"title": "A Tale of Two Plays", "date": "Friday 7 July 2017", "text": "In the last month I've been to see two plays at the RSC: Vice Versa at the Swan and Titus Andronicus at the main theatre.As you can see from the programmes, they were a bit different. 'Vice Versa' is a new play, written by Phil Porter and described as a 'side-splitting comedy romp', inspired by the Roman playwright Plautus. On the other hand, 'Titus Andronicus' is famously the Shakespeare play with the highest body count (which is saying something). I leave you to guess which one I was looking forward to most ...... which just goes to show how wrong you can be. 'Vice Versa' has had good reviews and most of the audience seemed to love it but it left both me and my son cold. There was no plot, no character development and the jokes were tediously predictable. For those of you of a certain age, think of a combination of 'Up Pompeii' and a 1970s panto. The production was excellent as were the actors but oh dear, what a play! We were still glad we'd gone as it gave us hours of conversation, trying to work out why it was so bad.Now for 'Titus Andronicus'. This is one of the plays I don't know so I read it before going to see the play. Well ... there are three hands and one tongue cut off, a double rape and so many murders I lost count. By the time I finished reading I was feeling slightly sick. I knew that the play would be better though; for anyone who thinks Shakespeare is difficult, do go and see it live - it will all make sense in the theatre.It's always interesting to see how each play is staged. Having seen 'Julius Caesar' and 'Antony and Cleopatra' this year which were both in Roman dress, I had assumed that this one would be too. Instead, Rome's Capitol was distinctly reminiscent of the White House, complete with podium, microphone and Secret Service men talking into their radios. The microphone itself almost stood in for the Emperor's crown (or should that be laurel wreath?) and the Emperor Saturninus himself was brilliantly played by Martin Hutson as an immature and needy politician.Yes, there was a lot of blood, but what was most chilling was the build up to the various murders with the actors becoming increasingly frightened as their fate became apparent. Hannah Morrish's performance as Lavinia crawling on to the stage after her brutal rape was incredibly moving. There was complete silence from the audience as she flinched away from her uncle and brother.And, as is always the case with Shakespeare, there was humour, often involving members of the audience as the actors broke the tenison by speaking to them directly (word of advice - if audience participation isn't your thing, don't sit in the front row of the stalls at the RSC). We were also amused by the man in the front row who, each time he was handed the 'baby' by the actor playing Lucius, hurriedly passed it on to the woman sitting next to him! It was quite a realistic baby but even so ...All in all, it was a fantastic play and gave us lots to think about. As my son pointed out, with all those deaths there wasn't a single suicide which was interesting given that it was a Roman play. There was lots of pleading for mercy which, in many other Shakespeare plays, would have had some effect but which never did here. And that led to more murders as each one served as revenge for the last.So, that's the two most recent plays I've seen. We've booked our tickets for the Winter season now and will be going to see Coriolanus and Twelfth Night, as well as Marlowe's Dido, Queen of Carthage and Kingdom Come which is a new play set in the English Civil War. Next month we're going to see Venus and Adonis, Shakespeare's poem, performed with the help of puppets. Lot's of interesting stuff there."},
{"title": "Shirley Hughes", "date": "Tuesday 27 June 2017", "text": "Listening to Shirley Hughes on Radio 4's Woman's Hour reminded me how much her books have meant to me throughout my life. She used her Guest Editor slot to talk about the importance of libraries, taking young children to art galleries and how to wear a hat.Well, I've never felt comfortable in hats but the bit about art galleries rang true. My children still remember going to see the Dutch Flower Paintings at the Dulwich Picture Gallery many years ago, the first of many such trips. As Shirley said, we would just look at a few paintings in a gallery and talk about what was going on in them. She mentioned going to see And When Did You Last See Your Father? at the Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool as a child; I went to the Walker a few years ago and that was one of my favourites.So, back to the books. I didn't find them all but here's just a few of the books I have that were either written or illustrated (and often both) by Shirley Hughes.It was interesting to see how many of my favourite books as a child had Shirley Hughes covers. Here are just a few ...I read and re-read all of these many times. Something to Do is a wonderful book. First published in 1966 it has a long chapter for each month of the year. There are nature notes, poems and, of course, lots of ideas for things to do, both inside and out. I particularly loved the craft ideas and longed to be ill in bed so that I could make a mouse out of a handkerchief.It never once occurred to me that I could make it even if I wasn't ill! By the way, I've since tried this and it's not as easy as it looks. I did however make some furniture for my dolls house out of conkers, as described in the chapter for October.I recently came across a Folio edition of this book, called Year Round Things to Do in my local secondhand bookshop and was pleased to see a variation on the original cover which kept the tree.It was when my children were small that I discovered the wonderful Shirley Hughes picture books. I always say that if you were told you could only have books by one author for a child, then she should be that one. Although why anyone would say that, I don't know! Anyway, I think the Alfie books were our favourites. He and his little sister, Annie Rose, lived in a London terraced house a bit like ours and the books are so warm and true to life. I particularly liked this one, An Evening at Alfie's.It's raining inside the house and, while their babysitter calls for help, it's Alfie who works out why Annie Rose is crying.The relationship between Alfie and Annie Rose is beautifully told and illustrated in all the books about them. The fact that my daughter looked rather like Annie Rose as a baby made them even more special. In The Big Alfie Out of Doors Storybook Alfie takes his special stone, Bonting to the seaside ... and loses it! This was more traumatic in our house than the time when Dave loses Dogger (don't worry, there's a happy ending and, this time, it's Annie Rose to the rescue). Alfie's Bonting had its own little bathing suit so both my children had to find their own Bonting and I had to provide the bathing suits. Here's my daughter's Bonting, proudly wearing his, complete with his name - just in case he got lost. It obviously worked as she still has it more than twenty years on.In case you're wondering, yes, this is going to be a very long post with lots of pictures. Feel free to go and make a cup of tea and come back to it later. Anyway, as well as the Alfie books, we loved the Nursery Collection - small themed books in verse.They're all really good, here are the first few pages of Bathwater's Hot ...Bathwater's hot, Seawater's cold,Ginger's kittens are very young But Buster's getting old.The Colours book is also wonderful - a perfect combination of illustration and text. Tangerines and apricots,Orange flowers in orange pots.Orange glow on an orange mat,Marmalade toast and a marmalade cat.'Marmalade toast and a marmalade cat' - I thing that sums up all the warmth and comfort of home to a small child. Out and About features the same children but is a bigger book with longer poems.Shirley also writes books for older children; here are just a few ...... and there's a lovely book called A Year of Stories and Things to Do which collects together lots of her different stories, interspersed with suggestions for things to do each month. Echoes of Something to Do here.Glad to see Bonting getting a mention.Does anyone else have fond memories of reading the Naughty Little Sister  books by Dorothy Edwards? These copies belong to my daughter and, yes, they are illustrated by Shirley Hughes.I'm still collecting books by Shirley Hughes only now it's often my children who buy them for me. This one, The Christmas Eve Ghost goes back to the Liverpool of her childhood.I also have her autobiography A Life Drawing which is a fascinating read and full of little pictures.Just look at all those different emotions on the evacuees' facesBut possibly my favourite of all her books and the one I think everyone should go out and buy - now! - is this one.A Brush With the Past covers the first fifty years of the twentieth century and is full of the sort of narrative paintings Shirley talked about on Woman's Hour. There is so much to look at in every one of them; it really is an art gallery for children in book form. Just look at the different faces in these ...Cold leftovers - An English country estate - 1908Homecoming tea - Yorkshire, England - 1918A slice of bread by the roadside - Northern France - 1940There are pages of text with more historical facts for other years but oh, the paintings. This is a wonderful book.Before I finish I must just say a word about Shirley's daughter, Clara Vulliamy, who is also an author and illustrator. She particularly enjoys illustrating classic children's books such as the Mary Plain books by Gwynedd Rae. If you haven't met Mary Plain, you're in for a treat. I'm also fond of Clara's illustrations for some of the Milly-Molly-Mandy Stories.This is the story where Milly-Molly-Mandy wins first prize at a party (a doll) and then swaps it for the little cotton wool rabbit that was the booby prize. I was that sort of child!Clara also writes lots of original books for children and then there's this series ...... the Dixie O'Day books, written by Shirley Hughes, illustrated by Clara Vulliamy. What a perfect combination.And now I really must stop. I hope I've encouraged any of you who have yet to discover these books to go out and find them or just to take a child to an art gallery. Thank-you Shirley for so many beautiful and inspiring books."},
{"title": "Good things come in small packages", "date": "Thursday 15 June 2017", "text": "I do like a pretty package, don't you? This one arrived from Weft Blown recently, complete with sheep badge. And inside was ...... a tiny weaving loomIt's a two inch pin loom made by Hazel Rose Looms. This is one of their smallest looms (it fits in the palm of my hand) and I absolutely love it. For those of you who don't know about pin looms, they are a very simple way of weaving shapes, based on the old Weave-It Looms which were very popular in America in the second half of the twentieth century. I first read about them in this issue of Piecework Magazine in 2010.My first Hazel Rose loom was a four inch square which I've had a lot of fun with; here it is with the new loom fitted inside it.The yarn is woven round the nails on the loom to create the warp and half the weft before the last half of the weft is woven with a needle to complete the square. These little squares are a great use of variegated yarn which looks completely differently when woven rather than knitted. The four inch squares in the picture were woven with James C Brett's Marble Chunky and all come from the same ball of yarn.Would you like to see what prompted me to order this new little loom?Isn't this wonderful? It's a blanket made up completely of woven two inch squares. Even the black sashing is actually lots of little squares. A member of the Looms To Go group on Ravelry posted this picture of the blanket she'd found in a charity shop and she kindly gave me permission to use it here. It's rather sad that such a beautiful piece of work should have ended up in a charity shop but now it's found a good home where it will be treasured.So, I've started on my own version. I think this one could take a while!"},
{"title": "Corduroy and Quilts", "date": "Saturday 10 June 2017", "text": "I am starting to get somewhere with some of my unfinished designs. This week I finally finished my knitted rug ...This has taken me over a year to knit - 150 small squares! - but I'm really pleased with how it's turned out. I'm calling it Corduroy as the deeply textured ripples are like huge corduroy stripes. For this pattern I developed a technique involving swapping between two sizes of needle and joining the rolls to the square as you go. I know that makes no sense at all but if you download the free pattern, you'll see what I mean.I must say that I think the edging is quite clever too, even if it did take me most of last weekend to work out how to do it. It's a knitted on I cord - simple but enough to tame the edges of this beast.Should you not feel the need for a knitted rug you could use the pattern to make a blanket. I think it would be lovely as a child's play mat; it's almost padded and little fingers would love all that texture. It could be knitted with scraps of leftover yarn too.I rather like the back of the knitting too which is perfectly flat.I'm now halfway through this year's calendar of mini knitted quilts too, having just published the June Quilt. Here are Quilts 1 - 6, January to June.The summer months are the hardest to design I think as I can't think of so many obvious things to use. Any ideas for July and August? Meanwhile, I'm catching up on some other unfinished designs: a crochet blanket, another knitted blanket based on a patchwork quilt design and a lacy scarf using KintCircus yarn. Oh, and I'm still working on the big KAL patterns for Christmas and 2018 ..."},

Bijou Basin is a family owned Yak ranch which sells high quality Yak fibre and yarns. I've never knitted with Yak wool but I'm assured that it is soft and warm.The pattern they are using is my Teddy Bear Stripes, although their bears will be knitted in one colour. Here's my original teddy bear (striped and otherwise) ...... and here is the sample bear, knitted with the Yak wool ...Isn't he lovely? He looks very cuddly. If you would like to buy a kit to knit your own teddy bear, you can order one from Bijou Basin for $25.

{"title": "Tatting", "date": "Wednesday 31 May 2017", "text": "Over the last few weeks I've become completely obsessed with tatting. It's not like I need another craft to take up time that should be spent working on knitting designs (or practising the violin) but, as soon as I picked up my shuttle again, I was sucked into a compulsive world of thread and tiny knots.In the years since I last did any tatting there's been this little invention called the Internet so I now have evidence that I'm not in fact the only tatter in existence. For a craft that's often described as 'dying' there are an awful lot of people out there doing it. There are lovely tatting blogs like Le Blog de Frivole and Lace-lovin' Librarian,  a Tatta Tat Tatters group on Ravelry and lots more. I don't do facebook but I'm sure there are tatting groups there too. Tatting developed as a craft in the 19th Century and is believed to have evolved from Knotting where a larger shuttle was used to make knotted thread that was then couched down to fabric as part of an embroidered piece.  Lace was very popular at that time but was also very expensive; tatting was a relatively simple way of making your own lace. In the first half of the 20th Century tatting was mostly used to make edgings for linen, doileys and collars and patterns for these can still be found in charity shops.In recent years the craft has developed with the availability of beautiful coloured threads, including variegated shades.  The ones I've started using are Lizbeth threads; in the picture above I tatted the centre of the motif with 658, Ocean Turquoise and am working the edging with 149, Peacock Blues. I've linked to the US site Handy Hands as they have better pictures of the colours but, if you are in the UK, I can thoroughly recommend Roseground who stock all the Lizbeth threads as well as other threads, shuttles and lots of tatting books. Their service is very quick and, with my first order of threads (yes, there's been more than one), they sent me a paper Lizbeth shade chart which is really helpful. It even lists which solid colours will match each of the variegated shades which is very helpful when you can't see the actual thread.Tatting threads come in various thicknesses (or should that be thinnesses?) - the higher the number, the thinner the thread. Mostly I'm using size 20 but I did try a little snowflake in size 80, just to see what I thought.The motif on the right was done with a thread that's about a size 10 so you can see how much finer the 80 is. Funnily enough, it wasn't much more difficult than tatting with thicker thread but I still think I prefer the look of the Lizbeth 20.As well as the thread, you also need a shuttle or a tatting needle. I haven't tried needle tatting so I can't talk about that. I have to admit that I was very taken with the shuttles - I do love a good craft tool - so that's what I went for. The ones I use are Aerlit Shuttles which come in various pretty colours and have a tiny hook on the end which you use for joining the rings and chains together as you go. The thread is wound on to a removable bobbin and you get a spare one with each shuttle.So, after all that, would you like to see my tatting? Of course you would, who can resist an offer like that? I started off with various motifs, mostly from the New Tatting book.The two at the top are Marigold and Dahlia and the one with the colours is the Hydrangea Mat. The snowflake is from Jennifer Williams' book Tatted Snowflakes. This is a clever pattern because you make two shapes and then weave them together to make the finished snowflake.Then I moved on to bookmarks as I wanted to make some things I could give as presents. This was the first one I made; it's Jon Yussof's Foldover Bookmark which is available as a free pattern on her blog Tatsaway.You fold the bookmark over the page where the two sections meet. This one was for my daughter. The next two were also from free patterns. The one with the ribbon is Bookmark with Two Layers, another clever pattern by Jennifer Williams and the flower one is Rachael Mohler's Flower Bookmark.I've just ordered another new tatting book (told you I was obsessed) but, while waiting for that to arrive, I've tatted a square motif from New Tatting and learnt how to do split rings from the same book. It has photo tutorials for the different techniques which are very clear. The blue motif at the top of this post is what I started last night (after telling myself I wouldn't start another tatting project). It's another free pattern from Jennifer Williams; this one is just called Motif for a Coaster.Have I persuaded any of you to have a go at tatting? It's much easier than it looks and the results are really impressive. You can find out more about it at the Ring of Tatters - that's where I got the information about the history of tatting. In fact I'm off now to join them."},
{"title": "Books & Ink", "date": "Saturday 27 May 2017", "text": "Tempted by the offer on twitter of a free Winnie-the-Pooh book bag when you spent £5 today, I wandered down to Books & Ink for a browse through their huge selection of books. I'm very lucky to have such a great bookshop just down the road. Their stock is mostly secondhand but they do have an interesting selection of new books too. Books & Ink live in an old, beamed building in Banbury's White Lion Walk, home of The Wisteria to beat all Wisterias. Thousands of books are arranged over two floors - on shelves, tables and in boxes - so many wonderful books.Vintage Children's BooksI've had a soft spot for this bookshop ever since my daughter did a week's work experience there when she was 16. She had a wonderful time and learnt lots about the book world. If you're not near enough to visit the real shop, do have a browse through their online shop. About a quarter of their stock is listed but you can phone them if you're looking for something particular. A Selection of Picture BooksSo, what did I buy today? Here are the three books I chose, together with my new book bag.A Bridge of Children's Books came from the 'Books About Books' section which is one of my favourites; there's always something intriguing there. This one looks very interesting. It's a translation of the original German book, written by Jella Lepman in the 1960s. She was a Jewish author of books for children who returned to Germany after the Second World War with a determination to help children indoctrinated by the Nazis through the establishment of an International Youth Library. The book is her account of how she set about achieving this.             \"Let us begin with the children, to slowly straighten out this utterly confused               world. The children will show the adults the way.\"                                                                                                                             Jella LepmanIt seems to me that her mission is as vital today as it was seventy years ago.The next book, I Believe in Unicorns by Michael Morpurgo continues the theme of war and books. Tomas lives in a Europe at war and learns about the power of books and stories to change lives. It's a magical book full of hope, beautifully illustrated by Gary Blythe.On a lighter note, the third book I chose was 101 Things for Girls to Do, first published in 1935 although my edition is from 1942 (so we're back to wartime again). It's subtitle reads 'being a review of simple crafts and household subjects'. I love this sort of book. As well the embroidery and weaving projects you'd expect, there are also sections on working with leather, metal and wood.Paper Beads and Wood CarvingHow to make your own caddy spoonThis last project appeals to me. Good caddy spoons are hard to find. What do you mean, you don't have a tea caddy? I use mine every day.I hope you've enjoyed this little look into the delights of my local bookshop. If you're ever passing this way, do go in and say hello."},

You never know what you're going to find. In the last few days I've bought this little collection.I've been looking for an old portable typewriter for ages but it had to be just right. I wanted one in good condition, at a reasonable price and it had to be a pretty colour. This one ticked all the boxes. It's an Imperial 200, made in 1973 and is in perfect condition. It even came with its original instructions and, as you can see, it's a lovely colour. You can still buy typewriter ribbons so I look forward to using it. Having trained myself to type gently on a keyboard, I shall now have to revert to my original heavy handed typing.I didn't buy all those tablecloths in the picture yesterday, just the one on top but I thought they looked nice together. They're seersucker and I always seem to find them for £4. Actually, I often buy them from the same stall at Brackley Antique Centre so that would explain it. I love all the bright colours and use these cloths a lot.The little toast rack came from Brackley too. It's Branksome China, one of the many types of china I'm partial to and I was particularly pleased to find this as it matches the cup, saucer and tea plate that I found in a charity shop last year. I love that combination of deep red and grey and the shapes are pleasing too, a bit like some Poole Pottery from the 1950s.See those wooden things at the front of the picture? They're bag handles (the sort you use to make work bags with - or you do if you're still living in the 1940s as some say I do) and I found them in a 50p basket in one of the charity shops in town. The lady on the till wanted to take 50p for all four but I haggled her up to £2. It's quite hard to find proper wooden handles like this now as they seem to have been replaced by plastic pretending to be wood. I shall enjoy making them into bags.I love finding old things like this. If you're interested, I could show you some of my other collections - tin postboxes, Isle of Wight studio pottery, posy brooches. And that's before I get started on the books ..."},

Luckily she was still in warranty but I was more worried about all my data. Which is where the wonderful people at Quickfix Computers came in. I took her down to their computer hospital (I'm sure that's the correct technical term) and they rescued everything for me. I was so impressed and yes, the first thing I did when I got her back was to back everything up.So, I'm back in business now. Mini Mabel did her best but I'm no good at writing on a small screen. Lots of blog posts in the pipeline ...In the meantime, you should have seen Tolly the kitten in the garden this morning. This is his first summer and he's enjoying being outdoors (as long as I'm nearby of course). Today he kept running at full tilt from one end of the garden to the other, obviously just for the sheer joy of it. Tomorrow I may get the bubble machine out and see what the cats make of that.Linnet is still a bit anxious outdoors after her run in with the dog the other week but is otherwise fine.

In the last few weeks I've got stuck on several new designs and all the new things I've tried to work on have failed. This was bothering me until I realised what was causing it - deadlines.As many of you know I design a big series of Christmas patterns for December each year so I'm used to that hanging over me but this year I've added to the pressure with the mini quilts. I was coping with that all right - after all it's only one small pattern each month - but then I had an idea for an even bigger series to run throughout 2018. So I'm now working to three lots of deadlines which is getting in the way of designing new stuff.It's a difficult balance to strike. The big patterns like these are very popular and therefore bring in more donations but ... they do make the whole exercise feel more like a proper job. I prefer working on designs that come to me out of the blue, just because they seem fun - drifting from one to another as the fancy takes me.I think next year I shall go back to just doing the Christmas series. I like all the big stuff I'm doing this year but it's just too much work!As I can't show you a picture of any of these things I'll leave you with another favourite picture book.This is one of the Frances books written by Russell and Lillian Hoban all of which are wonderful. Frances has a witty and mature style of language for a small child / badger; in this one she's put out at the arrival of a new baby and so runs away to live under the table (as you do). I also love Bread and Jam for Frances which includes the best school packed lunch ever, complete with a little vase of flowers. Any other fans of these books out there?"},

My neighbour came round to explain that a visiting dog had gone for her and that she was now at the top of the tree in my garden, hissing and growling.  So, after standing on top of a wobbly ladder for about twenty minutes talking to her, I managed to get her out of the tree. The concerned neighbours had to pretend not to watch as she's frightened of people so that of course made it worse.I then tracked her down to the top floor of the house and added insult to injury by sponging her with warm water. She had blood on her fur and I was trying to work out how badly she was hurt. In the middle of this tricky procedure the kitten arrived and started hissing at her. I think he could smell how frightened she was but it didn't help! I couldn't find any obvious wound so I left her in peace to calm down.She spent the evening in the hospital wing (my daughter's bed) and this morning seems fine. She ate her breakfast and then finished off the kitten's too so there can't be much wrong with her. As yet, she hasn't ventured outside again. At least she will now know to treat dogs with caution which isn't a bad thing."},

It's only about half an hour's drive from here and my son and I go to all the Shakespeare plays.Absolutely every play they put on is brilliant. The acting is wonderful, as is the music, the lighting ... you get the idea. I've particularly enjoyed Paapa Essiedu as Hamlet and Michelle Terry as Beatrice  but there are so many outstanding performances it's hard to choose. Last week we went to see Antony and Cleopatra and then we're going to Julius Caesar in a few weeks' time (wrong order, I know). The first Shakespeare play I ever saw was 'Antony and Cleopatra'. I was studying it for A Level and came on a trip up from Hampshire to Stratford to see it. It was 1978 and Glenda Jackson was playing Cleopatra - not a bad introduction to Shakespeare on stage!If anyone is thinking that Shakespeare sounds like hard work, I recommend going to see one of the plays; they're easy to follow when acted. If you can't get to the theatre, the RSC is bringing out DVDs of their productions. I would recommend the two DVDs of Love's Labour's Lost and Love's Labour's Won as an excellent starting point. They're dramatic, funny and full of brilliant songs.The Shakespeare films made by Kenneth Branagh are also really good. There's an excellent Much Ado About Nothing (my favourite play) or how about Love's Labour's Lost staged as a Thirties Musical? A couple of year's ago I was lucky enough to see Kenneth Branagh in The Winter's Tale at The Garrick.  It was wonderful.I shall leave you with one of my favourite speechs from Much Ado - not Benedick or Beatrice but Don John, railing against his brother whom he is forced to follow after an unsuccessful rebellion.'I had rather be a canker in a hedge than a rose in his grace, and it better fits my blood to be disdained of all than to fashion a carriage to rob love from any: in this, though I cannot be said to be a flattering honest man, it must not be denied but I am a plain-dealing villain. I am trusted with a muzzle and enfranchised with a clog; therefore I have decreed not to sing in my cage. If I had my mouth, I would bite; if I had my liberty, I would do my liking: in the meantime let me be that I am and seek not to alter me.'Act I, Scene III."},

England is very green at this time of year - the grass is a wonderful luscious colour and all the trees are coming into leaf - so I thought I'd reflect that in this little quilt. Mind you, it's hailing at the moment but we'll gloss over that. The tiny butterflies are very quick to knit but they took a-g-e-s to design. The smaller something is, the harder it is to make it look like anything other than a blob.I haven't make the matching fabric quilt for my daughter yet (sorry about that Rose) but I'm hoping to get it done this week.

{"title": "Who Was Richard Haka?", "date": "Friday 28 April 2017", "text": "I'm sure you're all on the edge of your seats wondering just that so I'll put  you out of your misery. Richard Haka was born in England in 1645 but moved with his parents to Amsterdam as a child. He went on to become a renowned maker of recorders and other woodwind instruments. Which leads me to this ...Aulos 709 BW 'Haka' Alto Recorder... my new recorder. This is a plastic Alto or Treble recorder, inspired by one of Haka's designs and I love it. It has a lovely tone and the matt finish makes it less slippery to hold. It also clogs up less than my old recorder (one of the less refined aspects of recorder playing).I bought my recorder in Leamington Spa from Presto Classical, a wonderful music shop that I've only just discovered. The staff are all musicians which is great and, as well as instruments, they also have a huge stock of sheet music and CDs. After choosing my recorder, I had a lovely time looking through their music - they actually stock recorder repertoire as well as tutors which is unusual. These are the two books I bought.I love baroque music so the first one, Baroque Recorder Anthology Volume 3, was an obvious choice. The other book, English Folk Tunes for Recorder, is for my other recorder which you might say is the new one's big brother.Alto and Tenor RecordersMy tenor is a Yamaha and was a birthday present from my Mum some years ago. I struggle a bit with the stretch on this one but tenors have a lovely deep sound. If you're not familiar with the recorder as a serious instrument, I can recommend The Flautadors. Here they are, playing a medley of the tracks on their CD Cynthia's Revels - more lovely baroque music."},
{"title": "Tunisian Crochet", "date": "Wednesday 26 April 2017", "text": "I have been having such fun experimenting with my new double ended crochet hooks from Purplelinda. Before I launch into blanket making with the Circular Hook, I've been having a little play with a standard Double Ended Tunisian Hook. Look what you can do!Isn't that clever? You get two different patterns and colours, one on each side. I'm using some neutral coloured aran yarn and odd balls of Sirdar Folksong Chunky to make a scarf. I've got three different shades of the Folksong so I'm swapping them every now and then so that they blend together. This is really compulsive to work on; another bonus is that the crochet doesn't curl as if often does with Tunisian. This is because you're turning the work to use the different yarns.I started doing Tunisian crochet last year. This is the first thing I made - a cover for my mini iPad.For this I used three shades of hand dyed yarn from 21st Century Yarn; I love the way the colours blend together, more like weaving than knitting or crochet.Then of course I'm still working on this ...Tunisian Entrelac, worked with a normal crochet hook.At the other end of the scale, I'm enjoying practising my tatting too. It's getting better, although it's best if you don't look too closely. I'm attempting the Hydrangea Doily from New Tatting which is made up of seven little flowers.Three more to go and then I've got to master adding the edging. I'm using Finca Perle 8 for the coloured centres and some anonymous white thread that I found lying around for the outsides. I'd like to get some thinner thread to try after this.Any other fans of Tunisian crochet or tatting out there? Tell me I'm not the only one."},
{"title": "Bicester Wools", "date": "Friday 21 April 2017", "text": "I thought you might like a look round one of my favourite shops. Bicester Wools - 'the little shop that holds a lot'- is an absolute must if you're ever in this part of the world. It's a family run business and is crammed full of yarn, fabric, haberdashery ... I just love it.So, let's start with some yarn ... See that crochet blanket? That's what made me buy one of every colour of Stylecraft Batik a few months ago. I'd seen the yarn before but didn't think it looked very exciting 'in the ball'; seeing this lovely blanket (I think it's the Carousel Blanket) changed my mind. You can also see some of the new Sirdar Colour Wheels at the front of the display. These are 150 g cakes of DK weight yarn, in some lovely colourways. I decided for once that I wouldn't go for the rainbow option, opting instead for shade 201, Colourama. That's the one with the knitting stuck in it - the colours blend into each other beautifully.I didn't take a picture of the wall of Stylecraft Special DK, I was too busy raiding it for colours.I'm still stuck on choosing the colours for this patternThere's also  Sirdar yarn, Rico yarn, James C Brett yarn ... you get the idea. Here's part of the Rowan display.Lovely knitting bags too - I especially like those ones with the sheep on. One of the most exciting things though is this ...Sock yarn! This is the only bricks and mortar shop I know that always has a good selection of sock yarn (sorry about the blurry photo, I get excited around sock yarn). I bought three balls from here, two glittery and one plain which I shall probably weave with. There's more sock yarn in these drawers, including some DK weight.They've got a good selection of books too. As with all their ranges, you can tell that they've been chosen personally. This means that you find things here that you don't see in other shops.As if that wasn't enough, the shop also has a huge range of quilting fabric, both on the bolt and in terribly enticing bundles and charm packs. If you can't resist the fabric but don't know what to do with it, they also run Patchwork Classes.What else? Well, there's the cross stitch and other embroidery kits ...Again, the personal selection shows - some lovely things here.Or you might want some of these ...... or these ...Perhaps some buttons or other haberdashery? Haberdashery - one of my favourite words.And then, of course, you might need a basket to keep it all in ...Can you see why I love this shop so much? Needless to say, the owners are very friendly and knowledgeable about everything to do with yarn and fabric; a visit is always fun (even if I do come out considerably poorer).There's so much to see, these few photos don't do it justice - you'll just have to visit for yourselves. A good day to go would be Saturday, 29th April as that's the day of their fabric sale - like you needed any more persuasion! One more picture ...Beautiful BatiksI hope you've enjoyed this little tour. Do let me know what you think if you visit."},
{"title": "Music Bag", "date": "Monday 17 April 2017", "text": "I felt like doing some sewing today so I set about making this ...I'm calling it a music bag but it would work just as well as a school book bag. it measures about 14\" wide and 11\" tall and the clever bit is the closure. The handle threads through a gap in the flap to hold it shut. It took me quite a lot of measuring and thinking (and measuring again!) to work out how to do that.The pattern for the Music Bag is free to download but, if you enjoy making it, do click on the fundraising tap on the sidebar to donate to my chosen charity."},

{"title": "This Week ...", "date": "Friday 14 April 2017", "text": "... I've re-learnt how to tat. Tatting is a way of making lace with a series of knots, using a shuttle and your fingers. I taught myself how to tat years ago, using this little booklet by Rosemarie Peel. I see you can still buy it for £1; with that, a ball of thread and a shuttle you're all ready to go. I was inspired to have another go at tatting by this book.New Tatting by Tomoko Morimoto is full of lovely colour pictures and the instructions for each technique are well illustrated and explained. So far, all I've made are some little flowers like those on the cover - mine are the two at the top of the picture - but I'm going to try the Christmas Rose design next.This week ...... I've been working on my Tunisian Crochet blanket.This is worked round and round, one colour at a time and, as you only have six or seven stitches on your hook, you can use an ordinary crochet hook. Shades of my Ten Stitch Blankets here. I found the instructions for this technique online (it's called Tunisian Entrelac in the round by the way). It was ages ago and I can't remember the site I used but there's a good Free Craftsy Tutorial by Kathryn Vercillo.While I'm on the subject of Tunisian Crochet, I've just ordered a Double Ended Crochet Hook from Purplelinda Crafts. I've got a digital copy of 101 Double-Ended Hook Stitches by Deborah Levyhamburg and I've been wanting to play with this technique for ages. I was given some money for Easter and this is what I've bought with it (thank-you Janet). According to my daughter, choosing a crochet hook over all the chocolate available at the moment is very sad.This week ...... I've been knitting lots more little squares for my rug.Only 40 to go - whatever possessed me to start knitting a rug?This week ...... I've been working on two big pattern collections, one for Christmas and the other for 2018. This is the Christmas one ...... well, you didn't really expect me to show you any more than that, did you? I've also been planning a new knitted blanket using Stylecraft Special DK.I have knitted so many samples, trying out different colour combinations and I'm still not sure which ones to use. I spent hours this morning, laying them all out and squinting at them. There are times when being very short sighted is useful and judging colours is one of those times. For those of you with better sight than mine I can recommend looking backwards through binoculars - jarring colours will jump out at you.And finally this week ...... I've been enjoying wrestling with my first Bach piece on the violin.It looks simple but there's so much to it I keep losing track of the time when I'm practising. I love Bach. This naturally led me to search out some more Bach to play on the piano.This one's not so simple but oh, so beautiful. Here is someone playing it much better than I can ...This is Tzvi Erez playing the Adagio from Bach's Piano Concerto in F Minor. I hope you enjoy it."},
{"title": "Knitting Notebooks", "date": "Thursday 6 April 2017", "text": "I've just started a new knitting notebook (the one with the big spots) and I thought you might like a glimpse inside some of the old ones. As you can see, there are quite a few of them. These are where I work out all my designs. I always start a new notebook very neatly - best handwriting and all that - but it soon degenerates into this sort of thing ...This was one of those ideas that never saw the light of day.You might recognise the next one as the start of my big Christmas pattern a few years ago. It took me ages to come up with a name for this one. I do hate it when that happens.Needle TreeAnyone remember this pattern?This one is called Which Came First? (obviously) and one knitter has made twenty of these.  This is how it started out ...That's enough of my scribbles."},
{"title": "Peanut Butter Cookies", "date": "Tuesday 4 April 2017", "text": "Today I thought I'd share with you an old family recipe for Peanut Butter Cookies. My Mum used to bake these for us and my brother and I both remember them well. A few years ago I tried to re-create them using modern recipes but they all had a lot more sugar and a lot less peanut butter than I remembered. Then I came across this old exercise book of my Grandmother's. It had been kept because of the family addresses in it but, at the back, there were a few recipes. Some of these were in my Granny's handwriting and some were written by her Mother, my Great-Grandmother, Annie. That's Annie in the photograph, taken when she was 18 in 1894. And here is her cookie recipe; it's a bit hard to see as it was written in pencil.I'm pretty sure that this is the recipe my Mum used - they taste just right. Peanut Butter Cookies3 oz butter, softened3 oz sugar5 heaped tbsp peanut butter1 egg6 oz SR flourHeat the oven to Gas Mark 6 / 200°C / 400°F.Cream the butter, sugar and peanut butter together.Add the beaten egg and flour.Divide the mixture into 16 and roll into balls.Put the balls on two greased baking sheets and flatten each with a fork.Bake for about 20 minutes (I swap the trays every five minutes) or until golden brown.Leave to cool on the trays.Since I started baking these I've had to resort to buying my peanut butter in big tubs rather than jars, 5 tablespoons is a lot! The one I buy is made by  Whole Earth. I hope you enjoy this recipe - let me know if you try it."},
{"title": "Craft Sunday", "date": "Monday 3 April 2017", "text": "I enjoyed last week's Craft Day so much that I decided to make it a regular thing. It really does me good to have a day off from the 'knitting empire' to do other creative stuff. It's made me realise how many unfinished projects I have lying around the house. Do you remember the snowball blocks that I finished hand piecing last week? Well, with the help of my Singer Featherweight Betty (she was made in Coronation year), they're now a fully fledged quilt top.I only make small quilts, this one's about 25 x 20\" A Featherweight machine is ideal for machine piecing as it sews a very accurate straight seam. Also, it's small (about half the size of a normal machine) and looks beautiful. Mine is about 65 years old and still going strong. Replacement parts can be bought if anything does wear out (the rubber feet deteriorate over the years); I've found this shop to be very good.The next project I worked on was a small needlepoint sampler that I don't think I've touched for nearly a year. Things have come to a pretty pass when you have to dust your sewing! I bought some lovely variegated Caron threads at the Crown Needlework shop in Hungerford, added a few plain colours and am just making it up as I go along, trying lots of different textured stitches.I was inspired to do this after enjoying working several kits by Sue Hawkins. The scissor keeper in the picture is one of hers; I bought the scissors from her too. Sue is often to be seen at needlework shows; do try her designs, she has a great eye for colour and her kits are fun to sew.In the evening I did some wool needlepoint. This is a kit for a purse designed by Rico which I bought several years ago from Abakhan in Liverpool. My daughter was living just down the road from the shop at the time so, every time I visited her, we would spend ages looking round the shop. Sadly, there isn't an Abakhan near here and, somehow, online shopping isn't quite so exciting.As you can see, this is an easy design to work, much like colouring in really. I suspect that putting it together will be trickier though; I'm not looking forward to attaching that clasp.I did think of doing some more work on the teddy bear that's been sitting in a bag in pieces for years but by the time I'd sorted through the pieces and worked out what to do next, I didn't feel like it. I've actually only got the arms and ears to sew before it starts looking like a bear. I sew my bears by hand, using backstitch and quilting thread for strength. Here are a few I made earlier ...Just to show that I do actually finish things sometimes, here's the scarf that I started weaving last Sunday.That's Mr Bennet modelling it; he's very patient when I want to take his photo. I used a ball of glittery sock yarn for the scarf; I've lost the ball band so I can't remember which one. It was really an excuse to try out my new Ashford Fringe Twister which I bought from Scottish Fibres. It makes twisting cords so much easier and also served to entertain Tolly the kitten. I tried to get photos of him 'helping' but he's nowhere near as patient as Mr Bennet.I wonder what I can find for next week. Does anyone else have craft days like this?"},

As it's April, it shows a small child sheltering from the showers under a big umbrella.

I don't think I showed you the March Quilt so here it is in both its forms."},
{"title": "The Patchwork Rabbit", "date": "Friday 31 March 2017", "text": "When my daughter was staying with me a few weeks ago, we had a day out at our favourite needlework shop. Cross stitch is her main craft and I always find myself wanting to cross stitch when she's here (she says I'm easily influenced). Anyway, the shop we love is called The Patchwork Rabbit and it's in the village of Bromham in Wiltshire. We'd been online customers for several years before realising that the actual shop was near enough for us to visit.The drive down took us past Silbury Hill and several White Horses which reminded me of my childhood - I grew up in North Hampshire where ancient history is never far away. I remember going to watch the archaeological dig at Danebury Ring in the 1960s and it was a favourite spot for days out and picnics. Anyway, back to the cross stitch ...The Patchwork Rabbit is only a small shop but it's crammed with all sorts of needlework supplies. There's patchwork fabric (naturally), masses of embroidery threads by Weeks Dye Works and Classic Colorworks, tools, buttons - treasures wherever you look. But, most exciting of all, there are cross stitch charts.Hundreds of beautiful designs, from the best American companies - Little House and Country Cottage Needleworks and Lizzie Kate, to name just a few - and many more. I love the designs by the French company Jardin Prive and there were lots of those to ooh and aah over. While my daughter worked methodically through them I flitted here and there, getting thoroughly over-excited! the shop owner, Karla, is very friendly and helpful, even when you spend hours choosing and keep her from her lunch.In the end we settled on a few charts each and then chose the special threads to go with them. I got this one ...I like designs in one colour like this and the abstract, spiral pattern is just my sort of thing. As you can see, I bought some of the lovely fabric hand dyed by Weeks to stitch it on. I've never seen this fabric here in the UK before and it's lovely. I also got a Christmas chart, there are so many wonderful Christmas designs we could easily have just bought those. This one makes me laugh every time I read it.I bought the special dotty fabric to stitch it on and some of the threads. By the way, these have wonderful names, the three here are called 'Brown Bear', 'Lemon Grass' and 'Licorice Red'.I don't have pictures of my daughter's charts but  they were lovely too. She even managed to buy one that wasn't Christmassy! We thought we'd been quite restrained but that was only because we've got so many projects at home to work on already. Also, now that we've decided to make regular visits to the shop, we can afford to space out our purchases a bit.I can really recommend a visit to The Patchwork Rabbit and, if it's too far away for you, do visit the online shop. As well as all the things I've talked about here, Karla offers several Autoship or Monthly Projects where you can sign up to get a new pattern each month. You can opt for just the pattern or add in threads and fabric - even the special little buttons that add the finishing touch.Santa's Village - just one of the Autoship SeriesSome of the autoships run between specific dates but, often, you can join in at any time. One day I shall treat myself to one of these.All that shopping had made us hungry so we followed it up with a (very cold) picnic in Savernake Forest, another of our old haunts. Normally I just drive through on my way to visit family in Andover so it was nice to be able to stop for once. We then had a quick look round the charity shops in Marlborough where I found an absolute bargain ... but that had better wait for another post."},
{"title": "Craft Sunday", "date": "Monday 27 March 2017", "text": "Yesterday was Mothering Sunday here in the UK and I decided to have a craft day. I spend so much time working on knitting and crochet designs that there often isn't any time left for all the other crafts I like to do. When my daughter was here last week we had a craft day when we both made a little felt doll.That's mine at the back and hers in front (her doll is hiding the fact that mine has wrinkly legs!) These were old kits from Mollie Makes Magazine; we used our own felt and threads but followed the pattern. They turned out to be quite detailed and took us most of the day to finish - it didn't help that I got carried away embroidering the tiny pockets on my doll's dress. The dolls are about the size of an adult hand and have pipe cleaners inside so that they can be posed.Anyway, I had a lovely day yesterday working on various different crafts. There was some of this ...Weaving a scarf with glittery sock yarn on my rigid heddle loom... quite a lot of this ...Hand piecing snowball quilt blocks... a little bit of this ...Pin Loom weaving... and, finally, this ...Cross StitchI thoroughly enjoyed it all - as did Tolly the kitten who got so excited by the big loom that he had to be sent out in the garden to play. There really isn't room for a kitten on my lap underneath the loom, especially one who keeps trying to catch the shuttle.It did make me think of other projects I'd like to get out again though. There are several lots of needlepoint and what about those snowflakes that I started crocheting from 100 Snowflakes to Crochet by Caitlin Sainio?Maybe next Sunday? By the way, you might notice that there are Belle and Boo tins in two of these pictures. I love them, I've got another one somewhere with some English Paper Piecing in. Both of the tins you can see here feature snowy scenes - very appropriate for snowball blocks and crochet snowflakes."},
{"title": "Socks, Socks and More Socks", "date": "Thursday 23 March 2017", "text": "I love knitting socks. I nearly always have a pair on the go; they're very handy for train journeys as they don't take up much space. I knit socks in various sizes, ranging from the small (which fit me) to the frankly ridiculous (he knows who he is).All of these are variations on my own basic sock pattern which I've been thinking of turning into Frankie's Knitted Stuff patterns. Would anyone be interested in a plain sock pattern? In case you were wondering, it is possible to knit a pair of socks to fit someone who takes size 12 shoes with 100 g of sock yarn - just. That little ball of  yarn is what I had left. At the other end of the scale I've also been knitting these little polka dot stockings lately.These are just 9 cm tall and I shall be attaching them to Christmas presents later in the year. I knit mini stockings to go on all my presents every year and put little chocolates in them. I've used my Mini Stocking pattern up until now but decided it was time for a change this year. This new pattern will be published in the autumn.I think this notice, which may or may not have appeared at a tube station, says it all really ...Apparently it is a computer generated image but none the less appropriate for that."},
{"title": "In The Bag", "date": "Thursday 16 March 2017", "text": "There's nothing like planning ahead and that's what I've been doing a lot of lately. First, I have a big bag full of Stylecraft Batik yarn. This is a lovely soft yarn which comes in a range of beautiful colours, all with a hand dyed look. It isn't an expensive yarn though, it's 80% acrylic and costs less than £2 for a 50 g ball. This is starting to sound like an advert - no, they haven't paid me to say this!Anyway, I designed a simple slip stitch cowl with this yarn a few weeks ago.This is Ribbon Cowl and it was such fun to knit that I thought I would use the yarn again. This time I've chosen ten shades and combined them with the aptly named shade Biscuit to make ...... well, I can't actually tell you that yet as this is a big project I'm planning for 2018. It will run as a free KAL throughout the year - or it will if I can finish it in time!I've also been busy planning my big Christmas pattern for later this year. I know it's barely Spring but these big projects take forever to get ready. Again, I can't tell you what it will be but it will be much simpler than last year's three dimensional scene. The Night Before Christmas I'm looking forward to revealing these big projects in due course. I always worry that, after all the build up, nobody will want to knit them but so far that hasn't happened. Fingers crossed ..."},

Isn't Renegade Unicorn the best name ever?Knit Circus hand dye their yarns, using a range of different Yarn Bases; mine is 'Greatest of Ease', a combination of merino and nylon but they also do one called 'Fairy Dust' which comes with extra sparkle and 'Lavish' which contains cashmere. Do go and have a look at their Online Store; I spent a ridiculous amount of time wandering through it, trying to choose what I wanted.I shall probably turn each of the yarns into something shawl-like but that's as far as I've got so far. The blue one did remind me of the sky in some of Turner's paintings but I'm not sure how much help that is."},
{"title": "Craft Books", "date": "Wednesday 8 March 2017", "text": "Since re-decorating my bedroom I've been slowly unpacking boxes of books to put back on the shelves. There are nearly thirty boxes and each one has some craft books in.After taking this picture, I found another six boxes to sort through.There are embroidery books ...... spinning and weaving books ...                                                                                                                                                        ... beading books ...... and two big pies of quilting books that I couldn't get near enough to photograph.I've really missed these books while they've been packed away so naturally I got distracted looking through them. I thought you might like a closer look at a few of my favourites.I've had this series of design books for many years now and have used them a lot. There are four books in the Needlecraft Source Book series, published by Anaya but now all out of print. Copies are quite easy to find on Abe Books though. Each book is full of inspiration; here's one of the pages in the Countryside one.I used the little ducks to embroider the collar of a denim dress for my daughter when she was a toddler. And I didn't stop at the collar ...There were animals all round the hem and a butterfly and caterpillar on each side of the collar front.Needless to say, this was her favourite dress.I also love my collection of Jane Bull books. Don't be put off by the fact that these are aimed at children. They are full of brilliant ideas and inspiring photography and, yes, they'd be great for children too.These books all feature a mixture of needlecrafts - sewing, embroidery, knitting ... Just look at these Dude Dolls from Stitch by Stitch.A strip of knitting with different colours for the legs, body, head and hat which you sew together and gather to make a doll. How clever is that? I really wish I'd thought of this idea.And how about these little felt creatures that she calls Minimals? These are from Crafty Creatures and each one has its own little matchbox bed. Now you know where I got the idea for my Pocket Ted toy pattern.This is getting to be a long post so I'll just show you one more book for now.I bought this book, by the wonderful Jean Greenhowe more than 20 years ago from WH Smiths in Peckham, after spending weeks looking at it and wondering if I could afford it. This was what tempted me.A little house for felt dormice, made to look like a cross section of a tree trunk. It's entirely made from fabric and unzips to reveal two rooms, complete with detailed furniture. Jean Greenhowe is particularly good on detail and all her patterns work beautifully.In the end I did buy the book and eventually made the house, again for my daughter. I have made things for my son too - honest! It was a bit battered when I finally unearthed it and tricky to photograph but here's the inside. The outside is just the same as the one in the book; I didn't think it could be bettered.I think that's enough for now. I'll show you some other favourites another day. And just in case you're wondering, my knitting books are kept in a different room. I shall have to show you those one day too - there are some real treasures. Anyone like to see my early Victorian knitting books?"},

This is the charity I have been supporting through my knitting and crochet designs right from the beginning. With the help of many lovely people, I have raised over £15,000 so far for this very worthwhile cause.Two children in the UK are diagnosed with a liver disease every day. The causes are unknown, there is no cure and these diseases are life threatening. Treatment involves a lifetime of care and medication, often including one or more transplants. The CLDF raises funds for vital research and supports the whole family of a child with liver disease, including after the death of a child.I chose this charity to support because of Alex, my friend's son who was born with biliary atresia nearly nineteen years ago. Alex has had the 'normal' childhood of someone with a liver disease - lots of medication and a school career interrupted with regular stays in hospital - but is now in his first year at University. I know that CDLF have given his whole family a great deal of support over the years, as they do for so many.You can donate to the CLDF on their Website or via my Fundraising Page. Any amount, however small, is gratefully received. Together we can really make a difference.I thought I would leave you with Harry's story ..."},
{"title": "A Favourite Book", "date": "Thursday 2 March 2017", "text": "As it's World Book Day today, I thought I'd tell you about one of my favourite books.The Little White Horse by Elizabeth Goudge tells the story of Maria Merryweather who goes to live in the mysterious manor of Moonacre, home to people and animals that all seem strangely familiar. At first it reads like a classic story of the orphan sent to live amongst strangers (Frances Hodgson Burnett was one of my favourite authors when I was young) but elements of fantasy creep in as she learns about the secret from the past that haunts her new world. I read this book many times as a child and it's still a very special book for me. From Maria's little attic room with its child sized door and biscuits on the mantelpiece to the wonderful Robin, 'the best companion in the world' - I loved it all. Books were a big part of my life when I was growing up, both owned and borrowed from the library. In the school holidays I would borrow three books one day (the most I was allowed to take out at any one time) and take them back the next. The librarian never believed that I'd read them! When I exhausted the children's library in town, my Mum asked for an adult ticket for me. They refused to give me one so she gave me her ticket to use. One of the many things I'm grateful to her for.What are your favourite books?"},
{"title": "A Lullaby", "date": "Saturday 25 February 2017", "text": "I've been learning to play the violin for four months now and I'm loving it. It's a very difficult instrument to learn but there's nothing like the resonant music you get from a stringed instrument, especially one that you play so close to your ear. I think the violin is the instrument that sounds most like the voice; I seem to remember hearing a radio programme about concert parties in the First World War which said that it was the violin that most soldiers wanted to hear. Violin music can sound like singing and it can sound like crying - that's got to make it pretty special.Needless to say, my violin playing might make you cry but not because it's beautiful. Learning to play in tune is one of the hardest things to do (that and the bowing, using muscles you didn't know you had, relaxing your hands while still keeping control ...). I put off learning for years because I didn't think my musical ear would be good enough. It turns out that learning actually trains your ear so I needn't have worried.I am now able to attempt simple tunes which is very exciting. I may not be able to play them properly but they do sound lovely when my teacher plays them so that gives me something to aim for. The first piece that I really worked on and loved was the  Brahms Lullaby.Now you may be wondering why there's a doll in the picture. Meet Tiny Tears, my much loved doll. I saw the television adverts for her when she first came out in the 1960s and really wanted her. On Christmas morning I opened a big box to find, not only Tiny Tears, but also lots of clothes for her and even a carrycot - all made by my Mum.I don't remember many specific presents from when I was little and this is the only one I can still remember unwrapping so that tells you how special this doll was. Anyway, back to the music ... Tiny Tears was advertised with a special song to the tune of the Brahms Lullaby.                                                        'Tiny Tears, Tiny Tears,                                                          You're my very own baby,                                                         Mummy's here, Tiny Tears,                                                          Singing you a lullaby'.So, before I even learnt to read music, let alone play it, this was my first introduction to classical music. Now my doll sits patiently listening as I try to play her lullaby."},
{"title": "The Cats", "date": "Thursday 23 February 2017", "text": "Remember when I told you how well my two rescue cats were getting on? Here they are, cuddled up together a few weeks ago ...Well, now Linnet has gone back to hissing at the kitten and not letting him come near her. Tolly went to the vets yesterday to be neutered (I took advantage of the Cats Protection League February offer of £5 neutering). Anyway, he was very pleased to come home in the afternoon but Linnet is now treating him as though he's a new cat.Either he still smells of a strange and scary place or she's not as bright as I thought she was and actually doesn't recognise him! Any ideas?Saturday Well, Linnet still isn't very keen on the kitten but she isn't hissing now so that's something. I suspect him coming home, smelling of the vets reminded her of bad times last summer when she was first rescued."},
{"title": "A Winter Walk", "date": "Sunday 19 February 2017", "text": "A few days ago my son and I went for a walk from Stonesfield, a Cotswold village about half an hour's drive from here. It takes its name from the slate mining which took place there up until the First World War. Apparently the church bell would be rung in the middle of the night if there was a hard frost to remind people to get up and uncover the slate so that the frost could split it into layers.Our walk began with this very old (and muddy) sunken path. There's something magical about a path that has been trodden for so long that it has sunk below the banks on either side. All those feet over all those  years ...Much of the walk was along the bank of the River Evenlode (more mud) but it was a fine, bright day, just right for walking. There was singing and there were marmite crisps when we stopped for a rest.Some of the first snowdrops I've seen this yearAfter our walk we drove to Hook Norton, home of Hooky Beer, in search of a pub for lunch. We came upon the Pear Tree Inn which is just down the road from the brewery. It's an old pub with a single, low beamed bar and good, simple food. While we were eating, the beer delivery arrived ...Aren't those Shire horses beautiful? I do like a proper pub and you can't get much more traditional than a horse drawn dray, can you?"},
{"title": "Odds and Ends", "date": "Monday 13 February 2017", "text": "Some of my patterns take months or even years to finish. This one for example ...Ten Stitch CornerWhile others go from \"I wonder if I can knit that\" to publication in a few days. Last week I wrote two patterns like that, both of which definitely fall into the 'odds and ends' category.The first one was a knitted version of those leather plaited bracelets where, although both ends are joined, the strands can be plaited and unplaited.Magic WristbandThen I started working out a way to knit a garter stitch heart in one piece and, as Valentine's Day was only a few days away, I thought I'd better get on with it. So, after several days of knitting and re-knitting, I had a formula to knit the hearts in lots of sizes. Normally I don't enjoy taking the photos for a pattern but these were fun to do.After rushing to get this one finished, what could I call it but Hearts in a Hurry. And now I'm going back to the normal designing; I've still got the mini quilt for next month to do."},
{"title": "Building Bridges", "date": "Thursday 9 February 2017", "text": "As I walked round Hazelborough Wood in the mud today, I was singing 'Building Bridges'. It's a song I learnt from an inspiring group of Woodcraft Folk last weekend and I can't get it out of my head. Here are the words:Building bridges between our divisions,I reach out to you as you reach out for me.With all of our voices and all of our visionsWe can make such a sweet harmony.And here is a short film of a Midlands Woodcraft Folk group singing it as a round. At the end of the film they also sing 'Link Your Hands Together' which is sung at the end of each Woodcraft meeting.'Ish ash osh' is how Woodies count in to their songs - I think the words are from a Native American language but I'm not sure. Perhaps someone out there knows? 'Building Bridges' made me think of Jo Cox and the work that she did to bring people together but, really, it's a song for all of us, at all times."},
{"title": "Happy Birthday", "date": "Friday 3 February 2017", "text": "A very Happy Birthday to this one ...And, for all the knitters reading this, here's one of baby plus blanket.As you can see, that blanket had pictures on the front and the alphabet on the back. Over the years, the dreaded moths got to it so it's sadly in need of some repair and re-knitting. I must get round to that one day."},
{"title": "Lucy Boston", "date": "Thursday 2 February 2017", "text": "Kaleidoscope PatchworkWhen I wrote about the Green Knowe books I mentioned that the author, Lucy Boston, was also a quilter. She created more than twenty beautiful quilts over the years, each of which is a work of art. Lucy sewed all her quilts by hand, using traditional English Paper Piecing where each piece of fabric is sewn over a paper template and then stitched together with small stitches before removing the papers. She started making quilts in her forties and continued into her nineties, by which time her sight was so poor that children from the village would come to thread her needles for her. Despite this, she still pieced her quilts with the tiniest of stitches and chose intricate designs. This is her last quilt, sewn in her nineties while her sight was failing.Islamic Tiles  PatchworkEach of those tiles is made up of either five or nine pieces (I think that's right anyway), carefully chosen so that the patterns on the fabric create further symmetrical designs. This was a feature of Lucy's work; you can see it in this section from her Patchwork of the Crosses quilt.This is perhaps the best known of Lucy's quilts today. Many quilters around the world have made it, some using English Paper Piecing as she did and others using the Inklingo method of printing the shapes on to fabric devised by Linda Franz. Issue 18 of Today's Quilter magazine had an interesting article about Lucy and her quilts.Reading this, I see that Sew and Quilt are running a Block of the Month club this year, making Lucy's Patchwork of the Crosses quilt using English Paper Piecing and Liberty Tana Lawn fabrics. There's still time to sign up for it; I think the quilts will look beautiful in those fabrics.Many of Lucy's quilts can be seen at her home, The Manor, Hemingford Grey, where you will be shown round by her daughter-in-law, Diana Boston. I really want to do that one day; to see the world of Green Knowe and an amazing collection of quilts in one day - what more could you want? Oh, and, by the way, Lucy also created a beautiful garden, full of old roses ...In the meantime, I turn to this ...This is a beautiful book, written by Diana, with illustrations by Peter Boston and photographs by Julia Hedgecoe. Nearly all the pictures in this post are from her photos. The book doesn't tell you how to make the quilts but it's full of inspiring details, extracts from Lucy's letters and much much more.The Patchworks of Lucy BostonYou can order this book from the Green Knowe Shop. Lucy Boston was a truly inspirational woman in so many ways. Do look at the quilts, admire what she created in her house and garden but, most of all, read her children's books.I hesitate to mention this after talking about such exquisite work but I did play around to see if it was possible to knit the Patchwork of the Crosses.It sort of works but I don't think it's quite right. Maybe I'll go back to it one day and try again."},
{"title": "Another Mini Quilt", "date": "Wednesday 1 February 2017", "text": "The second in my monthly series of Mini Quilts for 2017 is now available. February Quilt has hearts and flowers, plus some little buttons (I do love adding buttons to stuff).As with the January Quilt the pattern could also be used to make a block for a blanket, or you could add the hearts and flowers to other things. Here's the little fabric quilt I made for my daughter (two down, ten to go - will she get all twelve?) This series of patterns has turned out to be quite popular; I'm looking forward to seeing lots of finished little quilts, as well as the other projects knitters are using them for. Do come and join in the fun on the Mini Quilts thread on Ravelry.Now I just have to come up with something to put on the next quilt. Any ideas?"},
{"title": "Choosing Colours", "date": "Saturday 28 January 2017", "text": "I've just published a pattern for a Knitted Mandala and thought you might like to see how I set about choosing the colours for it. For this one I started with a piece of fabric and then looked for colours that were in the fabric.I decided to use Sirdar Country Style 4 ply and started off with these four colours: Parchment, Garnet, Soapstone and Purple Sage. They don't have to match the colours on the fabric exactly - near enough is good enough.Then I looked for shades of those four colours and added three more.So, there's a darker beige, a bright pink and a deep blue / green (Camel, Rosehip and Prussian). That bright pink isn't really in the fabric but you often need a bolder colour to bring the rest to life. If you look at these two twists of yarn, one without the pink and one with it, I think you'll see what I mean.Twisting the colours together like this is a good way to see how they'll work together. So, after all that theory, here's the finished mandala.It's knitted back and forth and then joined and blocked. I'm hoping that knitters will use this pattern to create their own mandalas in all sorts of wonderful colours."},
{"title": "Images For Science", "date": "Thursday 26 January 2017", "text": "Yesterday I went to an amazing exhibition at my local museum. International Images For Science 2016 is a touring exhibition produced by The Royal Photographic Society. As the photographs are under copyright I can't share them with you here but you can see the finalists in the competition here.There was paint on a speaker, dancing to the music, a balloon popping in slow motion (the skin peels back rather than bursting), the milky way seen above the clouds ... The photographs were inspiring, thought-provoking and just beautiful.After it finishes here, the exhibition will be going to Worcester, Derry, Edinburgh, London and Cheltenham. Full details are on the RPS website. You can also buy the Exhibition Guide which has 100 of the photographs, complete with detailed and interesting captions.Has anyone else seen this exhibition?"},
{"title": "Making it up as I go along", "date": "Monday 23 January 2017", "text": "I've just finished a new scarf design, Red Zebra - so named because it's red, it's striped and the yarn I used is called Zebrino which I thought sounded a bit like zebra.This scarf is one of those where I played about with the yarn until I came up with a combination of stitches that gave me a look I liked. By working double increases and double decreases all across one row of the two row repeat, I got a textured pattern where both sides, though different, are equally pleasing. The other row is plain knit by the way, just to give you a rest. The only slight drawback was a tendency for the knitting to pull to one side; I got round this by working blocks of the stitch pattern separated by five rows of rib. This meant that the 'right' side of the scarf changed with each block so I ended up with a straight scarf.Here's another scarf where I used lots of increases and decreases to come up with a heavily textured pattern.With this one you get puffy triangles on one side of the scarf and a lattice pattern on the other. Somehow, this made me think of dragon scales so I called this one Jabberwock Scarf after the wonderful poem Jabberwocky by  Lewis Carroll. Here's just one verse ...                                                   'Beware the Jabberwock, my son!  The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!                                                   Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun                                                   The frumious Bandersnatch!'Definitely one of those poems to learn by heart. Rhythm and nonsense are an ideal combination when sharing poems with children. Edward Lear is a great favourite with my family; I learnt The Owl and the Pussy-cat off by heart when my son was a baby so that he could watch me saying it. We also loved his Alphabet - who could forget King Xerxes, 'Xerxy, Perxy, Turxy, Linxy Lurxy, Great King Xerxes'?  Dr Seuss's ABC is another wonderful one to chant along together.What are your favourite nonsense poems?"},
{"title": "Green Knowe", "date": "Wednesday 18 January 2017", "text": "I chose the names of my cats, Linnet and Tolly, from one of my favourite books The Children of Green Knowe, the first in a series of magical books written by Lucy Boston. The book starts in winter with Tolly arriving to stay with his great-grandmother in the middle of a flood. As the snow falls and Christmas nears, she tells him stories of other children who lived in the house and it’s as if they’re still there …The books are set in and around Lucy’s home, The Manor, Hemingford Grey and were illustrated by her son, Peter who took the house and the things in it as his inspiration. Built in around 1130 and set in beautiful gardens, it’s one of the oldest continually inhabited buildings in Britain.If you visit Green Knowe you will see many of the things mentioned in the books; Tolly’s room in particular will be very familiar to readers with the rocking horse, bird cage and chest.You can buy the Green Knowe books and many other exciting things from Lucy’s daughter-in-law, Diana at the Green Knowe Shop. I can recommend the DVD of the BBC series from the 1980s of ‘The Children of Green Knowe’ as well as ‘From Time To Time’ which was based on ‘The Chimneys of Green Knowe’.But, most exciting of all, you can buy a copy of Tolly’s little mouse, taken from the original model. The book and a mouse would make a lovely gift for a reading child.And as if all that wasn’t enough, Lucy Boston was also a quilter. But that will have to keep for another day."},
{"title": "The Silent Piano", "date": "Monday 16 January 2017", "text": "It looks like a normal piano, doesn’t it? But when you press the keys, there’s no sound. It’s been in this sorry state for a few days now, ever since the piano tuner took away the mechanism inside to do some repairs. All the felt pads and little leather tabs on the hammers are being replaced which means that the dreaded ‘clicky keys’ will be a thing of the past. Of course, now that it’s silent, I keep wanting to play it every time I walk past …The piano is about ninety years old so it’s not surprising that it’s a bit worn. It belonged to my Grandmother who gave it to me when I started learning to play at the age of nine. My best friend was from a musical family and I think going to play with her was the first time I saw a piano in someone’s house. So thank-you Heather for a lifetime of music.The other person I have to thank is my Great-Grandfather who bought the piano in the late 1920s. He took Granny up to London on the train when she was about thirteen and bought it for her on a whim in Selfridges. They weren’t a well-off family and nobody played so that must have been quite a day. This piano has moved house quite a few times and even survived the ceiling falling on it a few years ago so it deserves some care. I can’t wait to be able to play it again."},
{"title": "On My Needles", "date": "Saturday 14 January 2017", "text": "I thought you might like a glimpse of some of the designs I'm working on at the moment. So ... let's start with the basket. That holds what's going to be a rug, made up of thickly textured squares. There will be 150 squares when it's finished and so far I've knitted 88. I've got to the stage where I've made a little chart so that I can tick each square off as it's finished. It will probably have some sort of border too but I don't know what yet.The red stripey thing is a scarf - that'll probably be the next thing to be published as it's quite a quick knit. It's another one of those designs where I made up my own stitch pattern as I went along. The yarn is Adriafil Zebrino - a variegated yarn, about halfway between a DK and an aran weight (125 m / 50 g). I really liked this shade (68) with its strong reds and oranges contrasting with the grey.What's next? That pile of shapes is the start of something - I don't know what yet - that I'm making with the yarn from last year's Opal Advent Calendar. This was a big box with 24 doors, one for each day of Advent, and behind each door was a mini ball of yarn.I had one of these calendars last year too (thank-you Rose) and that became a Patchwork Pelerine and a set of Advent Stars . In case you're wondering, a pelerine is a shawl that's square at the front but dips to a point at the back. I was inspired by the garter stitch pelerine in Elizabeth Zimmermann's book Knitting Workshop .My pelerine is made up of squares;it's very handy if you live in an old, chilly house as I do.The stars were knitted with the leftover yarn from the pelerine - I used up every scrap.This year I'm planning to alternate my knitted shapes with plain ones in a dark grey yarn ... although I'm wondering if that will be the right colour. If not, look out for a design in the future in dark grey 4 ply.Do you see that little bit of green knitting at the back of the picture? That's the start of a scarf or wrap, using yarn with little beads in. The yarn is called Moonstone and I have no idea how this pattern is going to develop. So far all I've got is a little holey piece that's starting to twist.And finally ... not on my needles but on my hook, the squared fabric underneath everything else is two sections of a crochet blanket. Quite a lot more to do on that one.I hope you've enjoyed seeing some of the things I'm making. I always work on lots of designs at the same time like this, trying to plan ahead while still finishing things regularly. Those of you working on my mini quilts will notice that there's no sign of the February Quilt. That's because it's all done - knitted, photographed and written up - and I don't want you to see it until it's published.Let me know if you'd like to see more 'On My Needles' posts in the future."},
{"title": "Meet the Cats", "date": "Friday 13 January 2017", "text": "Yes, that's right, I am indeed one of those people who likes to talk about their cats. In my defence, my two only came to live with me a few months ago. Both came from Cats Protection so they are rescue cats. I've had rescue cats before, including Tripod who was a three-legged feral cat (well, what else do you call a cat with three legs?). I might tell you about them one day.Anyway, back to the present. First of all, I got Linnet. She's a young cat who had been kept in a rabbit hutch and was very scared of people. If anyone went near her, she just froze. This is what she looked like when I first saw her; look at the fear in her eyes.Linnet spent the first three weeks here hiding under the bath, only venturing out at night or if she was sure I was out. I sat on the bathroom floor a lot, avoiding eye contact and talking to her until she eventually ventured out for a stroke. The big breakthrough, though, came when this arrived ...This is Tolly soon after he came home. Once Linnet realised he was in the house she started coming downstairs to keep an eye on him. She spent the next three weeks hissing at him but also watching him play. She would wait until she was alone in the room and then I'd hear her playing with whatever toy he'd just left.Tolly was the only kitten in his litter and his mother wasn't interested in him so he arrived with no cat social skills whatever. His approach to anything or anyone new was to bite and scratch. It was a great relief to me when Linnet finally accepted him and took over kitten training duties. He bites her, she licks him and slowly he's getting better. She even lets him play with her tail which I think is beyond the call of duty. So, here they are now ... Linnet posing at Christmas and Tolly in a box.This reminds me of a lovely picture book My Cat Likes to Hide in Boxes by Eve Sutton. Does anyone else know it? Interestingly, it was illustrated by Lynley Dodd who went on to write the Hairy Maclary books for which she is better known.One more picture - I think it's safe to say they're friends now."},
{"title": "Let's start with some knitting ...", "date": "Thursday 12 January 2017", "text": "Although I plan to talk about lots of other stuff in this blog, I thought I would start with the bread and butter of my life – the knitting.I’ve been designing knitting patterns and publishing them on Ravelry for quite a few years now. If you visit my designer page you’ll see there are hundreds of free patterns to download, ranging from blanket, scarves and shawls to toys and the purely decorative (what do you mean, you don’t want to knit a rainbow?). There are also quite a few crochet patterns but ‘Frankie’s Knitted and Crochet Stuff’ is a bit of a mouthful.Instead of charging for my patterns I ask that people consider making a donation to the Children’s Liver Disease Foundation which is a small charity that funds research and supports children and their families. Every day two children in the UK are diagnosed with a liver disease, making it more common than childhood leukaemia. Most liver diseases are life-threatening, the causes are unknown and there is no cure. Treatment involves a lifetime of care and medication which can include liver transplants. So far generous knitters and crocheters (is that a word?) have helped me to raise over £14,000 for this very good cause.So, back to the knitting. This year I'm publishing a series of patterns as a sort of knitted calendar, in the form of mini quilts. Here's the first month's pattern.This is the January Quilt. A friendly looking snowman, complete with jacket and a battered hat.Each little quilt is only about the size of a postcard and, as you can see, they can be hung on a mini hanger. I've added a button down sleeve to the back so that the quilt can be changed at the start of each month.The next quilt is all ready to go and will be published on 1st February.This would be a good time to mention my Ravelry Group where you'll find lots of friendly people, comparing notes as they work on their patterns and generally chatting. Some are going to turn their little quilts into bigger projects - perhaps blankets with the addition of some plain blocks - but lots of people are still at the 'I want to do this, just need to find the yarn and the time' stage.I also made a fabric mini quilt from my original sketch which I've sent to my daughter. Whether or not she gets another one each month remains to be seen.Is it just me or does this snowman have a bit of an evil look? By the way, the little clips holding the quilt on to the frame are Clover Mini Wonder Clips. I got mine at Cotton Patch. I had been planning to use mini wooden clothes pegs but they were too big.So, that's my first blog post. Is there anyone out there reading it?"}
