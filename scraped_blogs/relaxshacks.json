Too high end?\". In a way I feel that they have and I've felt that the scene has changed quite a deal from what it once was ten or twelve years ago. Perhaps that is a discussion for another time. And SIMPLICITY and vernacular design is certainly something we'll focus on at Tiny House Summer Camp in September (It's fun!!! Join us!).                                    Link to this year's \"Tiny House Summer Camp\" HERE In any case, in the sub-genre of \"sheds as tiny houses\" I came across this builder recently and thought that this cabin design of theirs was not only pretty darn sturdy looking, but was also a simple (yet large enough) footprint or floor plan that could be rather conducive towards a workable tiny house. So for all the shed conversion fans, here ya go! Check out the video overview they sent us, and let us know your thoughts in the video comments...."},

Check this one out- its loaded with a tours of not one, but SEVERAL desert builds- and all ones that were built from, well, local dirt, sticks, and upcycled materials. Meet Richard Ward from Terraform Together based out of Bisbee, Arizona. Richard, a longstanding dweller and member of the tiny house scene, has been hard at work on his off grid desert property that he purchased only a few years ago. As you'll see in this video, with the aid of some friends and willing students, Richard has created quite the desert homestead- one that includes (as you'll see in this tour) several earth built structures, and even a buried school bus guest house that serves as a student dorm. If you're into hyper adobe, earth bag building, solar power, mud construction, or looking to learn the ways of \"building with what you have on hand\", this one might be up your alley. Richard is very immersed in the world of reuse, salvage, and employing secondhand materials into his work, and you'll see plenty of that here! This video might give you a few ideas for your own builds, off grid homes, bug out shelters, budget building, tiny homes, Cobb building, and for desert living in general (reuse, recycling, repurposing, and salvaging in dwellings and buildings) #offgridliving #offgridhome #deserthomestead #homesteading"},

The decor in this tiny house or tree house is also pretty stunning. If you like funky \"flea market chic\" and eclecticism then this one might be for you. It's also an Airbnb rental under the name \"The Sassafras Treehouse\", and it is certainly a place I would love to see in person at some point. Its a no-brainer- this one combines my love of tree houses, tiny houses, and reused and salvaged materials- all of which combine to make this such a unique and attractive build. Be sure to check out the very creative Murphy bed, or \"Captains Bed\" that was custom built for this rental- also the old piano that they turned into an electric fireplace!

The room you'll see is part of a REALLY COOL Keene, NH airbnb listing that is entirely art themed in that each room focuses on different artists (one being me- @DeekDiedricksenart ). After this all went down (I did everything you see in a day) I later ended up getting Covid (the Omnicron variant- fun!) and while in \"basement quarantine\" I stumbled across a series of ASMR relaxation videos that I got sucked into. I then realized that this here film (which I originally intended to release in sped-up \"time lapse\" format) was pretty interesting and relaxing in its real time mode- at least I felt so. Whatever the case, it was a free form graffiti art project that through the narrations, gives a little insight into what I was thinking (and wasn't thinking) at the time. Everything you see is spur of the moment and unplanned. I hope you find it fun!

Well, here is a 14' by 8' tiny house on wheels (not road worthy) that is up for sale in Pembroke, MA that DEFINITELY needs A LOT of work. Question is: Could it be worth it? It is a cute little cabin (with a composting toilet, loft, and small kitchen space) that would certainly give you a jump on things/tiny house living, but you'll definitely need some know-how and elbow grease to finish this one and bring this little home to life. On the other hand, if fixed up, it could make for a cool little backyard rental, guest house, art studio, yoga space, or she-shed. Some of these airbnb's and hip camp rentals bring in a small fortune these days so it would be something to consider. Whatever your take on it, check out this video for more. If interested in purchasing it- contact the owner here- Wildirishfarms@comcast.net"},

Well, this duo is back at it again on their tiny cabin and tiny house rental compound with this super cool spin on these A frame plans of mine- a cabin with TWO opening walls/roof panels. Alla and Garrett really have a knack for interior design and color play and this little rental (also used as a hunting blind out there in Montana) is certainly no exception.

{"title": "Living On The Road/Making Money from TRASH....", "date": "Tuesday, June 1, 2021", "text": "While I don't live on the road, I OFTEN see people post on tiny house or homesteading pages asking \"How can we make a living while living on the road or off grid\"? Well, I feel there are a TON of ways to do it, and perhaps I'll get into that in another post. Again, I don't live off the road, nor off grid, but I do make a good deal of my living from \"nothing\"- repurposing the discarded waste of others and making it into art, fixing some of these items, flipping them, and so on. All of this can be done with minimal materials, with limited space, and its fun! Furthermore, these flat art items wouldn't take up much space (especially smaller pieces) in your tiny home, RV, or cabin. Canvases don't have to be frame either, you can simply paint them and roll them for storage or shipping if you are worried about space. Here's one I recently found/did. Its a bit more on the experimental/urban/weird side....So lesson ONE- if you have an inkling of artistic ability, considering rescuing some of those \"wine and paint night\" monstrosities you find curbside on trash day, and painting over them. You can then use this art for your own home decor, or possibly sell it (which I've done dozens upon dozens of times now). In fact I just made a huge graffiti piece that was shipped all the way to Miami to reside in a VERY swanky oceanfront apartment. This shipping ALONE was $250- which the buyer was fine with. Apparently they REALLY wanted this piece- which was flattering as heck, and profitable. But back on track...SOME of the art you find might actually be cool and/or fine as is, so before you paint over whatever, do consider its value as it already exists (and DEFINITELY look up artist names if the pieces are originals!!!). I've sold many pieces this way without having to do ANYTHING to them at all. Posting this type art on social media will also help with sales, but don't overlook old-school approaches. About once or twice a year I will rent a booth at a flea market and display some of my larger pieces there. These pieces (wildly colorful) are what I call \"eye bait\"- they are distracting/attention grabbing and draw people in out of curiosity. My intent often isn't even to sell these pieces, but to lure people in, who then end up buying the other junk I have laying around. Getting people to your booth is half the battle. These art pieces have also served as networking pieces too in that they frequently result in side jobs for me from the people that see them (graffiti mural work in a house, selling a few paintings to tv shows as props, and so forth- all connections that DID actually happen as a flea market. I even had a couple buy a piece of me at a flea, then contact me later on to make two more custom paintings for their home. So give it a whirl. Even if they never sell, its STILL a lot of fun and there are worse things you could do with your time. Oh yeah, want to support me/this page?

I could tell your stories of the HUGE scores I've landed until both you and I are blue in the face- but we'll save that for another time. I also run ANOTHER YouTube channel where I chronicle some of those finds (and report what they sell for via Facebook marketplace, yard sales, of flea markets). Check it here- https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3ePK6dw_7L5dlmkGZ5vVnwSpeaking of which, in further luck, we recently had a chance to pick through an abandoned 1850s house that was soon to be fully demolished- the house AND everything in it. Yes, we had permission to take anything we wanted as it was all destined for the dump. The owners had recently hosted an estate sale, but there were so many items in this hoarder house that it really didn't make a dent- and that is where we came in- cue to video.....Basically, here is proof that there are outside-the-mainstream ways to make a living- MANY of them. It just takes a little know-how, and a little elbow grease (and maybe a dust mask or two)."},

After recently completing her \"Transforming A-Frame Cabin\" build (from my plan sets/design available on this site), the former \"Naked And Afraid\" star is now well underway on her latest, and biggest, project- building her own permanent off-grid home. Its a project she's mostly tackling by herself (and with a few friends), and with a very limited outlay of cash. Located up in Passadumkeag, Maine, Kate has been working hard on this latest endeavor, while also recently turning her A-frame into a successful Airbnb glamping rental on her large parcel of private land. This video will give you a little more of a look as to what she's been up to- and what her future plans hold. Be sure to support her current life of self-sufficiency in the woods by possibly picking up something from her Etsy store too! https://www.etsy.com/shop/WilderBabeCreations?ref=search_shop_redirect-Derek \"Deek\" Diedricksen"},

Aside from randomly helping out whatever owners with the sale, it also gives us all a chance to look through theses small cottages, cabins, and tiny homes on wheels to judge whether or not the asking price is reasonable. Furthermore it also gives us all an opportunity to pick through a home and to \"take or leave\" some of the spatial arrangement ideas and decor elements. Lets face it, everyone like to voyeuristically paw through the homes of others- its why \"open houses\" are often attended by those that have absolutely no intent of buying.

{"title": "Go Underground!? A cheap, easy, underground camping hut", "date": "Thursday, March 19, 2020", "text": "I've long been sketching ideas for this, and have finally begun the actual build. The idea behind this is/was to create a simple underground camping hut or shelter that might appeal to:                                                        PLAN SET LINK IS BELOW-Those just looking for a fun building project-Peoplelooking for something that could be used as a simple camping structure for enjoying the   outdoors-A small lockable storage unit-Shelter- a basic one- that won't draw attention (is \"easy to hide\" for whatever reasons)-Could make for a fun kids fort or play structure-That might stand as an observation station for viewing wildlife.Ultimately, regardless of the reason, it had to be straight forward, accessible (in its difficulty (or lack of) to build), and affordable- much like our Transforming A-frame Cabin Plans (also at the link below).So, we came up with what we're calling \"The Snapper\". Why? Well, like a snapping turtle, it is compact, has a tough outer shell, and hides in the mud, out of sight. Why not BLEND into the natural landscape when building a small shelter, as opposed to sticking out like a sore thumb that doesn't belong?While this structure is meant to be built underground (earth-berm style), the plans for it can ALSO be used to build a cool and unique tree house, or a simple camping/escape/hunting/survival shelter that resides ABOVE ground. It is versatile. TINY as heck, but versatile. Sure, you could also build a larger/taller version of it with a few alterations.So, check the video on the progress so far.AND.... the PLAN SETS (working on them NOW) are available for pre-order HERE (and they're only $12 for awhile too!). https://relaxshacks.myshopify.com/collections/all-Deek"},
{"title": "I can't AFFORD a tiny house! They're too expensive! (No, they really aren't)", "date": "Wednesday, February 12, 2020", "text": "\"But tiny houses are just TOO EXPENSIVE! I never could afford one of my own!\" Its probably THE top comment we see on tiny house message boards time and time again, aside from \"But where's the bathroom?\", or \"I could never use a composting toilet!\".Regardless, with some of the high end tiny houses reaching prices well above $100k these days, its nice to see some simple, yet effective, conversion ideas and examples here and there.And this is one of them.I'll start with the immediate \"con\" of living in something like a RV or camper full time, and that's the fact that most RVs or campers are built and designed for OCCASSIONAL use- meaning that parts of them aren't built for constant wear and tear (many are built cheaply). RVs are often VERY POORLY insulated too (which can be a BIG deal breaker). There are some exceptions of course.On the other hand, small spaces are EASIER to heat, so if you're fine with that climatic aspect, moisture will be your other concern (and I talk about that in video too).Adequate ventilation (passive or active) is a MUST in any tiny house. PLEASE REMEMBER THIS.But that aside, here's a video tour of a great little Twentynine Palms, CA rental that I found particularly attractive, fun, and effective. If you click on the link DIRECTLY to the video, you can also join in on the pros/cons conversation in the comments. PLEASE DO!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGkWO5M4sN4The reason I've decided to share this one- RVS and campers can be purchased for close to nothing in some cases. With just a little elbow grease and NOT a fortune in materials, a camper could be converted into something more suitable for full time living for a mere $1000 or $2000.It has been done- MANY times.If you'd like to rent this place, here is a link for more.... https://www.facebook.com/purplepeaks.joshuatree/Also coming up, we have our HANDS-ON, Joshua Tree/Twentynine Palms, CA tiny house building workshop.

(price will be $299 instead of $359)\"Deek's Mad-Max-Like Weird Desert Camp Out DIY Thing\"(with a lot of tiny house focus/builders)(For tiny house fans, salvage nerds, n' thrifty folks that love building stuff) This is yet Another Diedricksen Brothers Workshop (always HANDS-ON building and live demos)- This is their NINTH YEAR hosting workshops in the US and beyond! I'm gonna be blunt here too- if its not fun, we're just not interested, so we want to show you a good time while you also learn a heck of a lot. But you don't know us personally, so you'll just have to take our word on that. A little getaway cabin/pod we built last time with novices as a framing exercise (29 Palms, CA)This workshop is \"out there n' funky\"- so maybe its not right for you. Perhaps you'd rather be at home collecting stamps, not taking chances, and being, well, lame. But if you want to hang out with us on a bizarre patch of desert land (5 acres) that we own, while slowly transforming it into something cool, while eating tacos, drinking beer/cocktails by campfire, seeing live demos, asking questions, building things, and so much more- than this is for you. If any of that scared you away- well, we just weeded you out. No love lost/no harm done. The land is rough, its a mess (for now- we'll change that!), but you're gonna be in great company and learn a lot. Don't worry, its not in the middle of nowhere, and you can drive right up to the site and park on it. This is also going to be one of the smallest and most intimate workshops we do, as we don't want this being a \"cattle call\" where you won't end up getting individual attention- you WILL. We have a host/teacher for every 4 students. You WILL NOT find that- EVER- with any other workshop! Saguaro Cactus- Downtown Joshua Tree, CAIdeally, we're thinking no more than 12-14 students for this workshop. Any more becomes more a \"mob\", than an easy-to-manage, fun, group that will get plenty of one on one QnA and build-contact time. This will be two days long- with the invite for you to come an evening early (3rd day) on work-study trade to help us set-up (and even build a little)- A \"Tacos, beer, and fire evening\" for your help. More on that lower below. Basically- the quick info first...-Again, Its two days, hosted by former HGTV host (\"Tiny House Builders\") Derek \"Deek\" Diedricksen with Steven Harrell (youtube host/builder for \"Tiny House Listings\"), and more.... -Cost is $299 per person BEFORE APRIL 1st. After April 1st it resumes the regular price of $359.00- so don't snooze! -We DO have camping options (space) if you'd like- nothing glamorous, but its merely offered for those that want to rough it and save some money. There is no running water or power- its a desert site, but VERY accessible and close enough to many stores, restaurants, and more. Each day you need to bring a lunch, and we'll disperse early enough for you to get a late dinner (or you can bring whatever). We're not caterers and people's diets are so varied that trying to feed everyone has been a nightmare in the past. -Its Sat and Sunday- 10am to 9pm each day. You CAN arrive Friday late afternoon too (details to follow) if you'd like, as part of the work-trade hangout (we WILL put you to work clearing/readying the land- but we'll provide the after-work beverages, a ton of tacos, and we can all hang by a fire (you'll need gloves and good work boots). Plan on working about 3-4 hours or so before we break (4pm to 7/8 pm). We'll then all hang out to hit a local pub to hang out together. THE MOST FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTION: \"Deek, I have no building experience- is this going to be right for me?\"YES, we'll have people of all skills levels, but this is more geared to people like you, and people that want to learn some outside-the-box techniques. We have so many cool things we'll be doing and taking about. WHAT WILL WE BE FOCUSING ON THIS TIME? Every workshop is different. The focus ultimately aims towards cabins, tiny houses, and budget building via small skill projects. While the various things we'll undertake serve as microcosms of many of the things you'll need to know, we'll also dabble with some desert-related approaches, and more. We want you to have FUN, and to learn, and to learn by DOING. We will not build a tiny house- there is no way that is possible in 2 days. This workshop is more DIY oriented with skill building projects, talks, QnAs by campfire, framing demos, and through you working alongside us on a few things. We want to give you the know-how and the confidence to tackle a variety of projects. More below...What if I need to cancel? Please make sure your schedule is free before signing up. There is no refund on this once you have signed up (I even put that in bold font (and this too) so you can't say \"I didn't know- I didn't see it\") but we WILL give you a credit to ANY future workshop we do (its your job to keep tabs on when we next have them and to contact us to use your credit). Again, just check your schedule before you sign up and there will be not problems.

{"title": "$9500- Tiny House/Cabin Camp WITH Land in NM for sale! ", "date": "Friday, July 13, 2018", "text": "So I really haven't talked about this so much lately, as, well, I've been beyond busy, but I've decided to sell my plot of land near Deming NM -which I've owned for almost 20 years. The plot also has this  unique little camp shelter parked on it now....which is included with the land.                      Above: The top of the front window/glass array flips open for ventilation.Its no mega-ranch in acreage, at a half acre, but there are NO neighbors within sight so you might as well call it 1000 acres. It also has road access and you can drive right up to the plot (even without 4WD), and the views are pretty stunning- especially the stars at night. And if you're into mountain biking, there is endless land and dirt roads galore for you to explore.The cabin looks directly at the \"Florida Mountains\" range- which has a prominence of almost 4000 feet. Downtown is also only about 25 minutes away (hotels, Walmart, tons of restaurants, a lumber yard, and more). Las Cruces and Silver City- two NM tourist destinations are EXACTLY one hour away. There are also plenty of very cool state parks nearby too (Rock Hound State Park being RIGHT in Deming, for one), and the \"City of Rocks\" state park (see the photo below of me bouldering there).         Photo: (during construction)- showing the front-window's direct view of the mountains- uninterrupted. We recently built a prototype glamping cabin that is parked/stored on the land too (see the slew of photos) and that is yours as well should you pick up this lot. Its simple, but funky/fun and well built and has a drop-down bed within (bunks could be added easily instead).In fact, there are two BRAND NEW sleeping bags already hung inside awaiting the next owner.                            Actual panoramic photo of the cabin in its desert-prairie settingThe materials in the cabin were many thousands alone, never mind the labor, so all things said, for a little getaway plot (we've camped there- its pretty awesome/peaceful) its reasonable and ready to go.Above: The original concept sketch. Designed by Deek Diedricksen, drawn by David Stiles. The cabin is on skids/runners too, so moving it could be an option should you want to change its orientation, or move it somewhere else completely. It would be easy to open up the back wall (via a doorway) to add on another room or legitimate bathroom to this camp. As of now we just used a composting camp toilet we'd bring with us.                       Me, climbing at the \"City Of Rocks\" state park- (about 45 minutes away)I designed this cabin, and it was built by none other than Sam and Lynsi Underwood of \"The Small Dwelling Company\" from Texas. DO CHECK THEM OUT- They're awesome! Here's the link: http://www.smalldwelling.com Their work is great, and we've showcased them on my youtube channel in the past (see below).            At night- the moon in the background...INTERESTED?If you might be interested, and have any questions- newenglandrockpress@gmail.com or PM me through my \"Derek Diedricksen\" facebook account. Just give me a little time to get back to you.Taxes are VERY reasonable/almost nothing ($16 a year)- and they are all paid and current. Buyer is in charge of the closing costs/document prep fees (I'm not even sure what they are for NM, but they're a couple hundred at most, from what I've read). Title/plot is owned full and clear....Here's the video of a past build from \"THE SMALL DWELLING COMPANY\" too..."},

When I bought the land only a year prior, the movie theater was still up and running, so it was sad to arrive and discover that it had, well, \"given up\".Below: From my new youtube channel \"ODDUSA\"- please subscribe HEREBut- think about it, this abandoned lot would make a GREAT \"Tiny House Village\" for a variety of reasons.... -The space is available and in a more affordable area of the country (that is all relative, of course)-Its already graded and traversable- you don't have to do much, or any, road or parking lot work, which can be exorbitantly expensive.-You have the added attraction of STILL being able to screen films community style, or still run the theater as a business perhaps on select days.-Easy access- the land is right off a fairly major paved road which leads right to the many amenities downtown.-There is already a large central septic system that presumably could/can handle large crowds-It resides in a town that could use the help, tax dollars, shop patrons, and PR boost.Piedmont is known as a bit of an economically \"tough\" town, as many towns in the rural midwest are, but I found it to be very picturesque, the people were very friendly, and it had a few really decent restaurants and shops. I would go back to visit, and will. The lumber yard there was actually fantastic- another huge \"plus\", and a business that such a community would certainly give LOTS of new business to.So, just an idea, and just a post in hopes that someone MIGHT see an idea like this and run with it."},

If she can climb the stairs easily, then we know we're set\".    Beyond that, for those STILL scared by stairs, this tiny house on wheels also has the foresight to include a downstairs bedroom- something still not all that common in small home designs.    It ALSO has a roof deck, but that was an add-on feature, obviously not aimed at the aging market. Regardless, its cool as heck! Be sure to check the video tour above.Don't like (or need) the downstairs bedroom? Well, the Unistrut dividing wall can be easily removed (as planned) so as to fully open up an otherwise partially segmented sleep space.     \"Our client was considering putting a few pinball machines in that space instead\", says Sam Underwood, \"It was built to be a versatile space- that was the whole plan\".    The Underwoods aren't new to the tiny house game either.

Don't be that person- there is nothing wrong with seeking help.But back on track....\"The lights here, I made those at glass-blowing camp\", says Grant in the video. Enough said.

", "date": "Tuesday, December 12, 2017", "text": "While we've been doing fully hands-on workshops since 2009 (one of the first (and very few) to do so), its an ever-changing field- \"the tiny house scene\" that is. I mean this in a stylistic, and technical way- especially as the builds get bigger, and, well, less sacrificial in their wants and needs- less sparse. Things aren't as simple as they used to (aim to) be in many ways. Much of this is beneficial in a sense of progress, and customize tools and appliances are developed to cater to the movement, while other aspects are debatable.Regardless, for years our core has been teaching 101-style for the brand-new \"never built-ers\", and then progressing upwards in the second and third days of class once we have everyone up to speed, but as times, interests, and needs change, it would be nice to get some \"audience feedback\" from those aspiring to build a tiny house. We cover A TON of stuff, and we're ever-changing- always- but we want to make sure we're not missing addressing some \"feared aspects\".What seems the most daunting part of your future tiny house build? What scares you and is keeping you from starting?Where do you draw the line in terms of what you feel you might want to tackle yourself, and what you're going to hire out? Electrical? Roofing? What do you want to walk away with from any workshop (cause God knows there rare 458 bandwagon ones out there now! Yeeeesh. Some solid- most, er, total and complete crap). Above: footage by Zane Spang at our Tiny House Summer Camp 5Granted, there is only so much you can cover in a two or three day space WHILE allowing time for explaining, questions, networking, \"tangental\" approaches, a communal meal, and the ACTUAL BUILD itself (in the case of our hands-on classes), but here is what we usually will try to cover, and WILL cover in two upcoming workshops we have....Boston, MA area (Stoughton, MA INSIDE an art gallery)- Feb 17th and 18th, 2018Joshua Tree, CA- March 23rd-25th, 2018--------------------------What we Cover- the initial essentials (we actually DO these things- not TALK about 'em)-Framing (building and over-building to travel)-Trailer building QnA/talk-Sheathing-Tool selection and use (hand and power)-Standard and non-traditional approaches to building (time saving tricks of the trade- building alone)-Shingling (cause many find it to be a pain)-Choosing systems (heat/AC) for a tiny house or backyard cabin-Designing for space efficiency-Budget building approaches- how to keep costs down while infusing originality in your home-What to AVOID in tiny house design- the FREQUENT mistakes we see!-Window and door framing-Circular saw use (long rips, plunge cuts, angles)-Constructing a roof- bird-mouth notches, rafter work....-Where you might be able to build it, and HOW....

That more or less sums it up.While the show won't aim to be ONLY musical, with its interviews and acoustic performances, we did kick off the first mini-episode with a send-off to the late Chuck Mosley who passed away in early November at the age of 57.Chuck, the one-time frontman of Faith No More (he recorded two albums with them), later went on to front Bad Brains, and then various other projects, from \"Cement\" to \"Vandals Against Illiteracy\".We were very lucky to have had the chance to film and interview and acoustic session with Chuck and his bandmates a mere 5 weeks before he passed, and I hope you enjoy what we were able to capture.R.I.P.

{"title": "IS the \"TINIER\" Tiny House Coming Back? ", "date": "Sunday, December 3, 2017", "text": "\"Bucking The Trend\"-Bear's Tiny Homes goes \"smaller\" in a scene where tiny houses seemingly are getting \"huge\".Mark Warfield (aka \"Bear\") shows off his new tiny house model \"The Bluebelle\"- a 20' long build with all the amenities most would need- AND storage.      So I'm recently back from a jaunt of a heck of a lot of traveling.... two different weekends in Florida to speak at tiny house festivals, another weekend near Dallas, TX for the always-great Tiny House Jamboree, and a few other side trips I'd have to sit down to recall. Aside from that I'm finishing up a follow-up to my book \"Microshelters\", rehabbing a tiny house on wheels, and building a custom tiny office on wheels for a client. So yeah. I guess I've been busy.But through it all, I've still managed to notice something- tiny houses, or at least a good portion of them, are starting to shrink back to their early-scene \"smaller\" sizes. Early on, and i'm talking ten years or so back, it was uncommon to see a house that was longer than 18'. Sixteen and Eighteen footers seemed the norm.Or perhaps I'M just getting larger. After all, we Americans are now in the midst of what I like to call the \"Thanksgiving to New Years\" gauntlet- 'tis the season of overeating!In anycase, as the scene continued to grow in popularity through the years, and spread like a virtual wildfire through the media, tv shows, and magazines, somewhere along the line, the houses started to get larger- and quite a bit larger. I remember entering my first 24' long tiny house and feeling it was \"enormous\" as compared to anything I had set foot in at the time. Well, that was long ago, and 24' has almost become the average- meaning, there are houses a heck of a lot longer and more sizable than that on the landscape. In fact, last year I toured a 540 square foot tiny house(!) on wheels. Call it a mobile home, or call it not \"classified as tiny\" as all, but it still serves my point. I've included that video right here:And this is NOT a bad thing that the houses are now more substantial- beefier- fancier- elongated. I'm not saying that at all.\"To each their own\" and everyone has their own set of needs, and different lifestyle needs through the size of a family, their mode of employment, and even with factoring in climactic conditions (people in warmer climates can get away with smaller abodes without cabin fever kicking in, and by being able to extend their everyday living spaces out of doors (decks, patios, breezeways)).But I'm wondering if I'm the only person noticing this, or if true, if its an economical response, or a realization that the much larger tv-dream-fed homes on wheels are far less portable- some getting as low as 4 mph when pulled.I'm not against the \"larger tinies\", as some call them, far from it, I just will admit that the smaller houses, if done well, bring more of a smile to my face (and to one's wallet).But enough on that. Enjoy the above posted tour of Bear's newest tiny house design and I hope at the very least that you grab some new ideas from it- both things you might want to employ in your future small dwelling, OR that which you may want to avoid.Its all a learning process.-Derek \"Deek\" Diedricksen(....and hey, if you want to ACTUALLY BUILD with us soon, March 23-24-25th (2018) is our next fully hands-on design and build workshop- Joshua Tree, CA!

", "date": "Wednesday, September 6, 2017", "text": "So, these \"dry flush\" toilets are relatively new to the tiny house world, and as of recent, I kept hearing of more and more of them being used, but there was never a video to show \"just whats up?\" with these units. I mean, how the heck do they work without stinking??Well, I recently got to spend a night at the rather-darn-cool \"Getaway Boston\" tiny house compound, and lo and behold, they had a dry flush toilet.While they are incredibly easy to use, I'm still not sure if I'd go this route (namely because of the plastic-based disposal bags you need to use). That said, its unbelievably simple as an install a system like this, it works like a charm, and the toilets themselves are rather traditional in their look (so as to not scare the already squeamish).Take a look at this video.... its explains, and shows. quite a bit more....-Derek \"Deek\" Diedricksen"},
{"title": "Finding Tiny House Land- Where and WHAT to look for? ", "date": "Monday, August 28, 2017", "text": "Lets face it, its not easy to find any town that will allow a tiny house, backwoods cabin, or a live-in tree house to be built in, but there ARE some that:-Just don't care (and want your tax dollars per square foot and nothing more)-Aren't staffed enough or organized enough to care-Won't ever be able to find you (again, understaffed)-Just want anyone new to be part of their town (spending money IN town, helping the local economy)There are MANY other reasons as well, but those seem to be the main ones. Of course, as I'll mention in a second, this often places you in an area that is not so, er, \"metropolitan\". Some gun for the solitude of far-out, small towns, while others blanch at the thought.I've found that looking into what are deemed nationally as \"4th class cities/towns\" are the ones most apt to have the fewest codes. Is not that they don't care necessarily, its that they can't and don't have the resources to (they might have bigger fish to fry).Anyway, having bought \"boondocks\" land a few times before (and THAT might automatically place some of you out of this interest group/discussion (\"I only want my tiny home downtown in NYC! (not gonna happen))), this video mentions a few things I look out for when considering inexpensive land. Remember, often times, cheap land IS too good to be true, so make sure you take your time looking into it- and certainly VISIT THE LAND, where and when possible.A FEW QUESTIONS TO KEEP IN MIND: In no particular order.... Does it flood?Will wetlands zoning restrictions hamper your plans and add in stress and limitations to your build?Is the area a drainage basin that will receive flash floods? Is the land in a valley?Do you get adequate sunlight?What is the resale market of the region (stagnant? on the rise?)Are there amenities nearby that will make your build and future tiny-life convenient enough?Is there the possibility for electricity? Are poles nearby, or will it cost a fortune to bring in?How much work will it take to clear space for solar panels if you want to go that route?Do you need to build a bridge, or clear a road for access? ($$$$)What are the nearest neighbors like and will they frown upon your plans and make things difficult?Is there easy access to the plot? (not 1000 turns on barely passable dirt roads 50 miles off anything paved)Is there a mud season in the region that might render the road impassable?For materials, is their a lumber yard close enough to the land/town?How rough is the terrain- soil, all rock? Steep?Are there any existing tax liens on the property?And on and on.....The point I'm getting at is that you need to know your needs and MUST do your research.I know too many people who too-excitedly jumped into a land purchase and later regretted it.Don't be that person.-Derek \"Deek\" Diedricksen"},

These workshops are fully hands-on and are just packed with eclecticism- from Japanese techniques, and salvage-based building, to tiny house trailer-build approaches, and MUCH more. We even have broadened the whole extended weekend with solar cooking demos (from Solavore), to daily wild edible walks and wilderness survival talks (at one particular station) from Matt Gabriel- aka youtube's \"AnimalManSurvivor\". At any given time there are THREE live builds too, and then demos and side focus talks and classes you can choose to attend at will. Oh yeah, its not just some wimpy 9-4 class either- we run it 9am until 10 or 11pm, when our nighttime bonfire talks and demos come to a close.\"     -Deek DiedricksenAs for who was just added?Well, coming all the way out from San Francisco, we're proud to announce the inclusion of Joshua and Shelley Engberg of \"Tiny House Basics\"!Joshua and Shelley are not only designers and builders, but they run a trailer building company (specifically for tiny houses) AND are tiny house dwellers. Check THEM out at http://www.tinyhousebasics.com Their own tiny house will be featured in the upcoming sequel-book to \"Microshelters\" and is just gorgeous.If you want to be able to pick the brain of two legitimate and experienced tiny house gurus, here is your chance!

Having recently just returned from New Jersey and the Tiny House Festival that took place in Augusta (where I was a guest speaker) I figured I should share this one ASAP.     From its simple yet attractive interior, to the full stove and range, full sized refrigerator, and given the fact that its all run on a solar/photovoltaic system(!), there is a lot of inspiration to be gleaned from this skoolie. Owner Michael Fuehrer and his father, the duo responsible for the rehab, did a fantastic job, as you'll see...     School bus conversions just might be a great option when seeking a tiny and mobile life- the watertight shell of a secondhand bus is your starting point, giving you the advantage of a dry work space, security, and even lockable storage as you build.     Not that long ago, I also had the chance to tour two other skoolies/converted school buses- both of them in the Atlanta, Georgia area.... check out these tours as well.....And.... one of the first ones I ever set foot in (which will also be featured in my upcoming follow-up to the book \"Microshelters\"...If you enjoyed those videos, PLEASE subscribe to our youtube channel here!

I never really knew where to put these photos and videos I often have shot on my road trips to film those tiny houses you might have seen (over 330 videos now), so I finally figured I'd start another side channel to house these little videos, excursions and \"vlog-like road blurbs\" (kinda fun to say out loud!)Its also fun to start new ventures from the ground up and see what, or what doesn't, become of them. Its similar to the excitement of starting a new band with a whole new lineup of ideas and members.

It seems there is a new \"Tiny House ________\" channel every other week as of the last year or so, run by some young, cute, tech savvy, $8.00 coffee drinking, hipster who seems to not even know all that much about tiny houses or design- and thats cool, really, but its served to not only spread the scene, but dilute it in a way as well. I've seen some great new channels and videos, and I've also seen some total crap- but perhaps we're ALL guilty of that at times.

Its fun, different- I mean, I've NEVER even heard of anyone doing something like this- and the people who attended the three day workshop get the bragging rights to one hell of a 'look what I built over the weekend' story. While most stayed at home, playing video games, or watching tv re-runs with their Cheetos-stained hands, we were off-grid in the woods crafting an enormous tree house robot!\"The structure, standing at just OVER twenty feet in height, was completed in just three days, while setting aside time for talks and instructions on technique. Furthermore, Diedricksen claims that with the aid of salvaged and recycled materials, it was built for well under $1000.00.\"While this thing is just huge, we also intentionally built the trail approaching it to arrive at this monster from a downhill vantage, making it seem even larger!\", added Diedricksen. \"It also lights up at night because of the clear Tuftex polycarbonate panels that we sided its front with. We even went so far as to build in a lantern-hook for the center of its chest. At night, it'll appear as if this huge creature has a glowing power source in its wooden sternum- a 'robot heart'\". That polycarbonate will also let us bring natural light into so small a space, while letting us achieve that nighttime glow that'll put this thing over the top!\"A student begins working on the rafter work for the tree house's roofHe went on to add, \"While most of my tree houses are whimsical and usually identifiable by those clear Tuftex walls I employ, I'm thinking that this one has to take the cake in terms of its bizarreness, and I'm pretty happy with it for just that reason.\"Diedricksen is now in the midst of an even larger tree house build for the Make-A-Wish Foundation in Clinton, CT, and plans to tie in some of this current build with another hands-on workshop- one taking place Saturday, September 10th (2016), and limited to only twelve students.

{"title": "A New TINY HOUSE and TREE HOUSE show w/The Diedricksen Brothers.....", "date": "Wednesday, June 1, 2016", "text": "\"DIEDRICKSEN BROTHERS \"MICROMEN\" SHOW, NOW FILMING\"Press Release: (courtesy of Aaron Perkins/Perkins Press)The Diedricksen Brothers (Deek and Dustin of Boston, MA), hot on the trail of having hosted and designed for both HGTV and The DIY Network (\"Tiny House Builders\" and \"Extreme Small Spaces\") have announced that they've decided to \"Go full-out indie\" with their next endeavor- \"The Micromen\", which begins shooting this month. You can check out the rough teaser trailer below. The duo, who travel the country teaching hands-on building and design workshops, and have released several books on the subject of building small dwellings and spaces (most recently, the best seller \"Microshelter\" (Storey Press)), has this to say in regards to this grass roots move:\"We've always done best- from books to video work- when we're fully in control, calling all the shots, and well, doing things how, when, and where, we please. Working for the networks was fun, and it opened a few doors, but it was often pretty faceless, and frustrating- not to mention back breaking. I've worked for a lot of other people, given up my ideas to them by contract, and played their game, and at this point I just don't want to do that anymore. If some smaller network comes our way, sure, we might consider, but for now we're going back to what we've always been doing, far before the TV shows, and expanding on it\", said Deek, in a recent youtube interview.\"Its not really a tiny house show, or just a tiny house show,\" added Dustin, the younger of the two. \"There are 9000 of those shows now, most of which are jumping the shark and getting gimmicky as all heck in order to try to hold viewer interest, and we just wanted to take things smaller, go simpler, and to make sure we're having fun all the while. We've already shot several side-sequences in a trek down south where we visit some incredible tiny houses, and even an amazing tree house bnb rental in Flintstone, GA, but we're taking inspiration from those spaces you'll see, and going smaller. Backyard studios, tree houses, hobby shacks, funky getaway cabins- that's where our heart is at. The shoots are all two or three days in length, with a smaller team, and a camera crew that just got off working for both Steve Carrell and Adam Sandler on a few films. We're in very good hands- our own.\"Deek went on to add that longtime crew member Jim Shippey (aka just plain old \"Shippey\") would be returning to this project (off his run with the brothers in HGTV's \"Tiny House Builders\"), and that \"new guy\" Palo Coleman (a stalwart in Deek's traveling workshops) is additionally on board.Deek and Dustin at a recent shoot/build in Sydney, Australia\"Palo is just out-there, resourceful, an easy going guy, and very creative- when he's not blabbing about 70s punk bands or his long-winded tales of living in Germany\", added Deek. \"Adding him was a no-brainer. We have one other cast member in the works too, but probably for episode two- Matt Fox, who was the longtime (ten years) host of HGTV's \"Room By Room\". We met Matt at a gig we did with the Property Brothers in Cleveland, and just hit it off with him. He'll bring a cool, and different, dynamic to this show, when and if we get him into the mix. He's another diamond in the rough that is being grossly overlooked by the tv and DIY field, and adding him to the crew will make perfect sense. Its just foolish that no one else is snatching this guy up right now.\"As of now, the trailer lists the release date of the show's debut as \"Fall 2016\".\"Hey, its our show, and our time line, so we'll see what happens\", said Deek. \"I'd like it out before then, but Dustin and I travel so much, and have so many Relaxshacks workshops planned, that I just don't know. The show WILL kick-ass though.\"Sponsorship/Product placement for the show- contact Ryan at newenglandrockpress at gmail.comMeanwhile, the Diedricksen Brother's next slated hands-on building and design workshop is September 16-18th in Orleans, VT, and billed as \"Tiny House Summer Camp 4\" via www.relaxshacks.com------------------------------------"},

Packy and his crew were ultra friendly too- which is always nice to find.     Anyway, this tour here is of their SMALLEST model- a sixteen-foot-long tiny house on wheels that weighs in at around 7000 pounds- which, believe it or not, is pretty light as compared to many tiny houses out there now. Packy pulled this model with a Toyota Tundra.     Aside from a generous loft, and a great little bathroom, this particular tiny house, as you'll see, is adorned with some great interior trim and woodwork, is heated with a compact mini-split system, has Japanese-style \"tansu\" steps to ascend to the loft, soft-shut drawers, and a nice little kitchen area ta' boot.     Check out the full tour, and I hope you enjoy it!Reminder: Tiny House Summer Camp 4 on our 10 acres off-grid spread in Orleans, VT is already filling up, so if interested in camping out with us, and THREE days of actual, hands-on, building, design, and guest speakers galore, hit THIS link for details and sign-up links...... http://www.relaxshacks.blogspot.com/2016/03/hell-yeah-tiny-house-summer-camp-4-has.html-Derek \"Deek\" Diedricksen"},

Heck, I just don't have the time or desire, as instead, Dustin and I are out there building, traveling, hosting workshops, and well, generally trying to kick as much ass as we can. We've been doing so professionally since 2009 when we hosted our very first FULLY HANDS-ON workshop (something you RARELY get from other events), well before everyone and their grandmother's former scuba-instructor decided to jump on these classes as well. There's an avalanche of tiny house workshops out there now, all in the wake of the 13.5 tv shows on the subject. Some of them are solid, but most are absolute crap, so let me explain what we do, and why we've been doing them for so long.Also, Thank you in advance to those who share and spread the word on this, as NO, its not a photo post featuring some gorgeous supermodel- NO, this notice doesn't have some click-bait title like \"WOW! You WON'T BELIEVE what lies beneath the trap door in this abandoned garage!\", and triple-NO, its not a post about a young cutesy couple who \"simplified\" their lives and bills, buy having someone build a $140,000 tiny house for them. None of that silly crap. Never. Live music by the fire, on a lantern-lit mini stage, after our guest speakers (last year)I can add a ton of fun photos below, and some video links of past workshops (and I will), but let me just sum things up by saying that this isn't our first rodeo. Dustin and I have taught workshops, built for museums, and design consulted \"From Fargo to Sydney\"and just about everywhere in between. Palo Coleman, bamboo joinery/construction demo at our CT workshop this past year....So, WHY SIGN UP for this, and not another workshop? There are too many reasons.....-Dustin and I are former HGTV hosts (\"Tiny House Builders\"). We've also been featured on, and hosted other programs for HGTV and the DIY network. -We've designed for many other tv shows, magazines, charity events, and design blogs. MANY.-Deek has authored THREE books on the subject, going back to 2009. His most recent book \"Microshelters\" was picked up nationally by Lowes and has made the best-sellers list. -Its a HANDS-ON workshop- no staring at a power point presentation eight hours a day. You're getting dirty, having fun, and ACTUALLY BUILDING. There is no real substitute for this. MA- Hands-on Museum Cabin Build.....-We have several people who will be attending for their FOURTH year in a row- which is saying something. -Forget a rented function room at the Ramada Inn, we're off-grid on TEN private acres, with TEN tiny cabins, shelters, and funky shacks on the premises. THINK and design outside the box while BEING outside the box. One of Deek and Dustin's HGTV build from their show \"Tiny House Builders\"-We have MULTIPLE projects/builds going on at once, and you can move to each group as you please so as to get a taste for many styles of construction, various approaches, and all with different instructors. -Yes..... different instructors. We usually have about EIGHT pros at each workshop. There is no shortage of people to ask questions to. We want to make sure that you get as much personal building, and brain-picking time, as possible. You get our personal email too, should you have questions AFTER the workshop. Deek in Australia giving a salvaged-windows demo to a sold out class....-Its MORE than just tiny houses. We mix in collaborative art and decor, salvage construction, and heavily force you to \"Think Outside The Box\".One cabin (8' by 14') that we'll work on. It still needs a loft, insulation, bathroom, deck, trim, door, and more..... this is one of a few projects on our 10 acres! -Does their workshop have a big-ass PIZZA PARTY ice-breaker by a bonfire, fireside guest speakers, a GHOST NIGHT HIKE, fishing, LIVE MUSIC from a candlelit stage in the woods, bamboo demos, Shou-Sugi-Ban Japanese techniques, and a Kong Island-like entrance gate, topped by a giant Owl head?? Nope. -Its NOT a 9-5 workshop. The building continues until the sun goes down, and then the speakers and discussions begin. -Tree Houses- we have tree houses, and you can STAY in them. -The woods of Vermont, and the neighboring towns are GORGEOUS. I mean Norman-Rockwell-painting gorgeous. There's a GREAT local swimming hole, covered bridges nearby, and so much more.-Door prizes and Tiny House Trivia..... we want you to leave with swag! Help us DOWNSIZE our prize closet! ;) -\"Robot Grove\"- do the other workshops have a pine grove deep in the woods with 10' tall recycled-material-built weird-ass robots? Nope. -Want to stay in an off-grid, solar log cabin? Yep, we have one of those too....AND I THINK YOU GET THE IDEA......-----------------------SIGNING UP/PRICE.....Its $399 for THREE DAYS- and again, they ARE NOT 9-5 days. The first two nights run until 10pm. Its a TON of contact hours, fun, networking, and skill developing. This is the same price its been for five years, and again, this is no 9-5. Many other workshops charge this much as well, and DON'T let you build. YOU WILL have fun and learn LOTS- unless you're completely dead from the neck up. This is an \"AT YOUR OWN RISK\" workshop, and you additionally will still have to sign a waiver to be allowed to build with us. By signing up, you are in full agreement and understanding with this. Refunds. Large Font so that you can't claim \"But Deek I didn't see the refund policy!\"Full refund up until 30 days before the workshop starts. Thirty days, not twenty nine- Thirty. After that, rain check/credit only- which other workshops don't even do- we're being VERY fair with this credit. If you don't show, and don't tell us, and the workshop had begun, there is no refund. PLEASE, PLEASE just plan accordingly and make sure you have the time off and reserved- its a total pain to reschedule and shift/change attendees- we'd rather focus on planning for the actual workshop!-Derek \"Deek\" DiedricksenAny questions, ask them below, or email at newenglandrockpress at gmail.com"},

I mean heck, I'm an adult who gets to make part of my living building forts, offices, and cabins in trees- what's not to love?My book \"Microshelters\" features a few I've done over the past years, in addition to tiny houses, art studios, forts, backyard offices and more.... You can check that book out HERE: Meanwhile, here's my last tree house of THIS season, as, well, its getting a bit cold and icy out there in Massachusetts to be monkeying around up in trees.This particular tree house build was an affordable one that worked in some salvaged from a pre-existing tree house on the site. This little cube-like, modern cabin is a mere 7' by 7' (to thereby allow 8' stock plywood sheets to overhang as its roof decking), is adult-standable on its entrance side, features a mini bunk-loft, and resides about 8' off the ground. It also has a cool little porthole window worked in (from the company \"Pet-Peek\"). They're about $30 on Amazon....Initially it wasn't going to have posts, but anytime I build a tree house for clients with kids, its an extra step in safety and \"just in case\" precaution that I like to take. Another rule of thumb is that I usually won't build off any tree that is under 12\" in diameter. The different tree house features in my \"Microshelters\" book drop some other tidbits and rules along the way if you ever happen to check that out.I'll have a full video tour really soon on this one, so keep an eye out over on www.youtube.com/relaxshacksDOTcom. And our NEXT hands-on Workshop....CHATTANOOGA, TN- THREE DAYS!

Sorry for the absence, but not only have I been completing a few client gigs (one, a tree house just yesterday here in MA), but I was on a 2 week book tour on the west coast in promotion of my latest offering, \"Microshelters\".  YOU CAN CHECK OUT THE BOOK BY CLICKING HEREThanks to those who have checked it out!A little about it....This book is LOADED with photos and is full-color- its also pretty eclectic in that while it showcases many tiny houses and their floors plans, it also features tree houses, backyard art studios, and even whimsical tiny structures and forts. There's a reason I gave it the title it has.There are 2 zillion \"strictly-tiny-house\" books out there, so I wanted to make this one varied and eclectic, seeing as I feel that a good many tiny house ideas can be gleaned from that which isn't solely a boiler-plate definition of a tiny house. Don't worry though, there's lots in small spaces, tiny houses, and ways to approach designing them.This book is a over double the volume of \"Humble Homes, Simple Shacks\", and took almost three years to assemble as I did things the slow, hard way. A good many of the photos in the book were taken by me in my travels, I built a large chunk of the structures you'll see, did a decent amount of the sketches in the book, and, well, of course, wrote the whole thing.Anyway, I hope you dig it/give a chance. Its part coffee table book, part salvage idea-book, part tiny house book, part whimsical structures book, and with a whole lot more mixed in! It think its only like $13 on Amazon too, so if you find ONE idea in the book that saves you $13, never mind saving you $1000 potentially, its money well spent.Its also features framing plan sets for 6 select structuresAlso, for those who haven't checked in lately, our NEXT fully hands-on workshop is this one!

Tiny House Summer Camp 3 (sold out) is on the horizon, and we'll be working on FOUR different projects/structures.... one of them (the smallest) being a tree house pod of sorts (lightweight and VERY inexpensive) that also might have potential as use for a small homeless shelter/sleeper (half the initial intent).When done, it'll be able to sleep two on its floor- sleeping bag style. You can't stand in it (working one one of those too), but there will be plenty of room to stretch out, and some built-in shelving. Of course, in the case of the homeless, it probably would NOT be position in a tree, but on legs on the ground.What is show is the INSIDE wall, which will radiate its color through the parallel clear wall. The exterior will all be natural tongue and groove (and later, plywood could be used- cheaper!)Basically, I'm seeing lots of pods for short-stays for the homeless that are devoid of character or style, and that are too drab in color, so I'm just messing around with this as a new, very mobile, idea- yes, it could easily be pushed on wheels.Eventually we'll have a time lapse video of the whole project as we assemble one of these in Vermont.AND..... we've quietly announced our NEXT workshop- BELOW.

{"title": "THE tiniest tiny house out there? THIS ONE has to be close! ", "date": "Monday, June 22, 2015", "text": "So, to make a long story short, two things.....ONE, after getting word from a friend (tiny house dweller Chris Haynes) that he was selling his tiny house (A model called the \"XS\"- no longer carried by the Tumbleweed Tiny House Company), AND when I heard how affordable it was, I jumped at the chance and bought it. Its a mere 60 square feet in size, with a tiny loft....I'm going to renovate it down the road, and use it for guests here and there, but mainly, I just thought it was a cool tiny, tiny, tiny house. Did I mentioned its ONLY 6' by 10'. Yes, it has a loft, but a very small one (complete with a secret hatch, and storage that I'll show you in a video down the road).The \"XS\" in transit to be delivered to my place. It was moved by Bryan at www.shedmoving.com- they did a great job! This brings me to....TWO.... (Want to see it? Want to BUILD and DESIGN with us? Want to completely revamp a downtown storefront with art and funk in one of two days we're gathering?)One reason I purchased this, is that aside from the ongoing projects and funky cabins that people will get to see in my backyard when I do workshops, I always want to make sure people get to set foot inside a real-deal tiny house. There's no better way to get a feel for one, and its capabilities, or limitations, than to actually get your ass inside one. This one, mind you, could be one of THE SMALLEST ones out there, so it serves as a better in example in that anything you're probably planning on building will feel palatial compared to this!SO.... (and it might be available to stay in too).....\"FUNKY ART, and the MAKER AESTHETIC MEETS TINY HOUSES\"! MICRO, TINY HOUSE and MAKER WORKSHOP- STOUGHTON, MAJuly 25th AND July 26th, we're doing a VERY SMALL, VERY INTIMATE, VERY FUN two day workshop in my funky, weird, storefront art studio in downtown Stoughton, MA....We'll have guest buildersA demo and talk or two, three.....We'll work on many skill-sets while building and designing wooden art pieces, and more, for ANOTHER underutilized storefront in town.... (scroll saw work, framing, chop saws, tricks of the trade, design principals).We'll tour a tiny house and other micro cabins....and you'll be led by myself (Deek Diedricksen), Dustin Diedricksen (both from former HGTV shows, etc), Chris Haynes (tiny house dweller and builder), and MORE tba!Here's the thing, this workshop is LIMITED TO ONLY 15 attendees! Its going to be fun, we'll ACTUALLY BE BUILDING and taking on lots of build-meets-art projects that tie into tiny house techniques.....and we might even have a lathe demo.There will be door prizes, tiny house trivia for prizes, AND, a bar-hop one night after the workshop.... maybe even a post-workshop/non-workshop bonfire....Workshop is July 25th and 26th- Sat and Sunday9 am to 6pm each day....Plenty of places to eat nearby (most within a few hundred feet), There's the Stoughton Motel to stay in, and a Radisson nearby, and more..... and, while building, we'll be helping to infuse a community with art.We'll have a sign-up link soon, but meanwhile, you can email me at newenglandrockpress@gmail.com if interested.

{"title": "YOUR TINY HOUSE- why not STILL keep it simple? ", "date": "Monday, June 15, 2015", "text": "WHY NOT STILL KEEP IT SIMPLE?Photos from www.blackcoffeeatsunset.com (Porcupine Mountains in Michigan)With tiny house tv shows spreading like wildfire, the media covering the subject more and more, and what with the newer 5067.8 tiny house blogs out there (forget the 430 twelve-page e-books), I've been noticing a trend in tiny housing in that the homes are getting bigger, fancier, more gadget-laden, and WAY more expensive. Television, a whole world of \"you gotta wow-'em at every turn\" is part of this newish direction in that networks spread, or create, a skewed vision of what is \"the norm\". But I feel its also due to the fact that when an idea starts going mainstream, you're going to find newly introduced folks who love tiny houses for their \"cute factor\", but who still yearn to squeeze the pool table and triple stack washer onto a quintuple-axle travel trailer. I call that approach \"Ten gallons of shit, in a five gallon hat\". It usually doesn't work so well, especially once you try it on.I'm not knocking these houses- not fully, and not all of 'em- but I'm starting to feel that some people are losing sight of what a decent chunk of this scene's impetus is about- keeping things simple, affordable, and realistic. Or maybe I feel that some are just overlooking the fact that a simple home could work just as well for them as an over-the-top Rube-Goldberg-esque one.I myself don't live in a \"tiny\" house, but a damn small one, with a family of four and one big-ass dog. I also grew up in a small home, vacationed in small cabins, camped with the boy scouts in small camp structures, and have built and designed a TON of tiny houses, art studios, backyard offices, and tree house cabins for clients, so I like to feel that I know at least a little bit about what I yammer upon. This is just opinion though- and everyone's got one.Anyway, more and more recently, I'm internet-inundated with images of completely over-the-top tiny houses that seem more hell bent on creating something so incredibly high-end, or weird, that the viral-video or Huffington Post headline seems more so the goal, and not the livability, or cash-factor, of being in such a space. Eclecticism, IS good, mind you- I've never had a problem with it, or inventiveness, but I just feel that the media is starting to portray this movement that is often rooted in living for less, with $89k homes- hence this mini, meant-to-be fun, rant....I was reminded of my personal love for simplicity when I stumbled across this photo (further above) from the blog www.blackcoffeeatsunset.com. This gorgeous little cabin (and I wish I had more interiors- yeah, yeah, I can foresee the complaints already) is so damn simple in its look, build, roofline, and presentation, that to me, its just friggin' great. Why try to reinvent the wheel thirteen times over when a good many who came before you probably had their crap together more than you or I? I'm not saying don't build in a secret passage from a grandfather clock up to your lofted master bedroom (that actually would be completely awesome(!), for the record), but make sure that what you employ into your design, suits you, and makes sense- that's all I ask, and really, all I'm getting at. That stobe-lit, glass unicorn prow on the front of your house might land you a few kick-ass blog stories, no doubt, but remember that you later have to live with that stupid things once its \"old hat\". (In all fairness, I DO build and design some bizarre things, but all of them are affordable, and serve a function (or are based on the clients request)).Check out that lead photo though- the cabin you see doesn't have nineteen wind-dragging and leak-prone gables, its devoid of a pair of fold-down decks, and you're not going to find $35,000 of solar panels cantilevering from its roof at odd angles, nor a ergonomic hammock woven from hipster mustache trimmings, but what you do see is a cabin that will keep your ass dry, warm, and that could be built for very little money......and THAT, I'm reminded, is why I, personally, am in love with tiny structures. I'm not everybody, and better than no one (well, maybe except the cast from \"Honey Boo-Boo ;) ), but that's where I'm coming from- nothing more.That cabin- its vernacular design. No bells, whistles, or Inspector-Gadget like transforming, quadruple-use $5600 kitchen appliances (that you probably won't use anyway).So, while some of the fancy houses (I'll freely admit) sure are cool as hell to look at, and do offer some awesome new takes on architecture, I'm simply reminding you to at least consider to KEEP SHIT SIMPLE. Its not a contest, and competing with the micro-Joneses is the last thing this scene should be about, so perhaps just relax a bit with those visions of Ewok-bridges to your fourth wine loft. Yeah, these out-there ad-ons are fun, but paying for them, and later never really utilizing 'em isn't.Again, my lil' opinion- meant to be just fun- and of course \"to each their own\"'Hope you're all well!-----------------------------Derek \"Deek\" Diedricksen's work has appeared in the NY Times, Boston Globe, China Times, and about twelve zillion other media formats. He, and his brother Dustin, were hosts of the HGTV mini-series \"Tiny House Builders\", and have built and designed for The DIY Network, The History Channel, and for clients and art galleries ranging from Fargo to Sydney, Australia, and everywhere in between. Deek is the author of \"Humble Homes, Simple Shacks\", and the upcoming book (Storey Press), \"Microshelters\".Deek and Dustin ALSO host Hands-On Tiny House Building Workshops.

This studio is not a public store, but a space for creating and messing with new ideas, AND will be the site, here and there, for a couple mini workshops down the road. \"But Deek, didn't you already have an art studio in a factory space?\", you may be thinking. Yes, I did- but it was my goal all along to place some lighting, art, and fun, in an abandoned storefront in my downtown-in-need-of-help, so when the opportunity presented itself, I moved from one private space, to a public one in Stoughton, MA.So, keep checkin' ole Relaxshacks.com for updates, as in July, we just may have a little shindig/event/class with speakers, projects, and more! newenglandrockpress@gmail.com if you might want to sign-up.... it'll either be one, or two, days....As for the old studio, JUST before I moved, The Boston Globe came out and did a little photo session/article....

Relaxshacks.com Tiny House Building/Design Workshop in Putnam, CT, we built and designed a small art studio cabin INSIDE a really cool space called The Empty Spaces Gallery.

Any purchases also go towards a new Stoughton, MA revitalization project I'm working on- I've rented out an empty storefront in the troubled (business-wise) district of my town, and will slowly transform this into a window-display art gallery in order to bring some additional life, and light, to this town (its old center). My hope is that down the road, someone will be inspired to rent an empty or abandoned storefront in this town and do the same, and before you know it, voila, we're slowly becoming an art town, and bringing in some new, window-gawking, foot traffic....which then helps the existing businesses.Meanwhile, to pay the rent, I'll be selling art pieces here and there, and occasionally hosting classes and little workshops in the space. So keep checking back!Here's the space now..... and just you wait to see what it will look like down the road! We have a long ways to go, but we'll get there!Of course, if you want to help out, we do have a DONATE button in the upper right corner of this very blog.

We've been working/writing as \"Inverter\" since 2012 more or less, but this is our first official release, so give it a whirl. The band really is just a studio project- myself on drums and vocals, and Bill Bracken on guitar and bass, but we're working towards making it a live vehicle and doing some dates down the road. Soon.Special thanks to Jim Foster of Red 13 Media, who recorded this album at his Framingham Studios, and to Jim (again) and Anthony Lewis, who busted ass with this music video- shot in a mere 4 hours.If you want to help us out, for a mere $8, you can pick up the album....Itunes:https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/inverter/id977779056Amazon: http://www.amazon.com/Inverter-Explicit/dp/B00UV1N0KK/ref=sr_1_2?s=dmusic&ie=UTF8&qid=1426685161&sr=1-2&keywords=InverterCD Baby: http://www.cdbaby.com/cd/inverter --------------------------------------------------------------As for the cut-and-paste press release we grabbed offline from a metal/hardcore news site... from an interview I did a few months back.....\"Mark your calendars as March 16th, 2015 signals the release date for the independent offering from the \"new\" Boston, Massachusetts-based act/project \"Inverter\". The two member \"band\", comprised of Derek \"Deek\" Diedricksen, and Bill Bracken- both longtime musicians, WBCN FM (CBS Radio) alums and members of the New England scene, has been writing and recording under the \"Inverter\" moniker since 2012, but this self-titled album stands as their first official full release (at Red 13 Media in Framingham, MA with Jim Foster). Why should we care? Well, for the simple sake of \"WTF!?\" curiousity, and all-out randomness, we recently found out that frontman Diedricksen had been doing some hosting and design work for both the HGTV and DIY Networks this past year for a show called \"Tiny House Builders\", which debuted this past December. \"HGTV meets HARDCORE and METAL\"? We NEVER saw that one coming. Furthermore, if Madball, Downset, or Prong, are your thing, these guys might be right in your wheelhouse. ------------------------------------------------------------Anyway, to those who give it a chance, pick up a copy= THANK YOU!-Derek \"Deek\" Diedricksen"},

Shannon's work is often seen in magazines ranging from Better Homes and Gardens, to Country Living, Vintage Style, Flea Market Style, and beyond. She is also author of the book \"Color, Create, Decorate\", and has contributed to many others such as \"Salvage Secrets: Transforming Reclaimed Materials Into Design Concepts\" and \"Salvage Secrets: Design And Decor\". She has also worked for, and appeared, on HGTV, and The DIY Network. (This interview was conducted inside a tiny A-frame cabin/garden shelter (or office) that was a LIVE, behind-the-ropes, build by Derek \"Deek\" Diedricksen, and his brother Dustin Diedricksen, for the 38th Annual St. Louis Home and Garden show where both brothers, and Shannon, were featured speakers. This A-frame cabin, which was built for under $1000.00, was completed in 3 days. The front of it is clad in clear Tuftex polycarbonate roofing, and its roofed with Ondura roofing (www.Ondura.com). Roy St. Clair, a friend of the brothers, was  the third member to help with this live build.CHECK OUT SHANNON'S BOOK BELOW! ----------------Also- don't miss Deek and Dustin's LIVE, ACTUAL-BUILD, workshop coming up!!! Click on the banner on the top of the blog for more info....OR CLICK HERE FOR MORE INFO"},

I've been selling original pieces for some time now simply through my personal Facebook page- \"Derek Diedricksen\", and while I've sketched hundreds and hundreds of tiny cabin ideas for my blog or my books, I've done very few in color.Above: My studio- decked out with many free, salvaged, and recycled items....I figured, why not work on some tiny art pieces, that could be potentially used as decorations in tiny houses, cabins, or tree houses- or for those aspiring for tiny spaces and wanting a little art piece to remind them of their eventual goals?Above: Sketch I did of Tammy And Logan's Tiny House (one built by Dee Williams). www.RowdyKittens.comI'm no Rembrandt, but have been having a lot of fun messing around with salvaged materials, recycled and leftover paints, and small yard sale canvases.

{"title": "Porcupines? A threat to Tiny Houses and Cabins?? Yup.... ", "date": "Tuesday, February 10, 2015", "text": "Its not like we have enough things to worry about and maintain as homeowners, weekend cabin builders, and tiny house enthusiasts, but yep.... I've been waging an ongoing battle with porcupines on my land in northern Vermont, and I'm slowly, and barely, treading water in this battle.In several areas of the country, porcupine are so damaging to cabins, stored materials, sheds, and tools, that you're bound to get a heroes welcome if you bag one. Beyond that (and I talk about this more in my book \"Humble Homes, Simple Shacks\") in some regions, the porcupine problem has gotten so bad that an introduced species (Fishercats- almost looking like descendants of Wolverines), have been brought in to combat this woodland problem.They say that if an axe was left unattended in the woods for a long enough time (and not even THAT long, I imagine), that its handle would be eaten clear off by these spiked critters. Porcupines, you see, LOVE salinity, whether it be the oil in your hands that is left on an axe handle, or the salty and aromatic glues used in most plywoods on the market.The aim of the video above wasn't to illustrate the \"Porcupine Threat\" point (and yes, I realize that they were there first), but you'll get to see a mere fraction of the damage that one porcupine did to our backwoods tree house sleep shelter in Vermont while we were away. This peek of the damage is shown once this short tour moves to the interior of this little tree house.Notice the metal collars on the poles of this structure? It helps (a bit) to keep them at bay.... keeping nearby trees at a distance (to keep them from climbing a tree to get onto your structure) is also a very good idea too....As for other techniques to keep Porcupines at bay- I list a few further below....And should you happen to catch a porcupine red-handed, here's a recipe I found for Porcupine stew- kidding.... somewhat....  Many people in this region shoot these animals when caught, so if that was to be your choice of action, why let the animal just go to waste? I don't hunt, but I also don't like seeing anything wasted, IF someone was to bag a \"quill-dog\".http://www.bigoven.com/recipe/porcupine-stew/7165As for my book, where I get more in depth with my dealings with Porcupine, you can check it out here....They ARE fascinating animals, with an amazing adaptation for survival, but man oh man they're a pain in the butt!HOW TO KEEP PORCUPINES AWAY FROM YOUR CABIN(a short list of what works and what doesn't- (I've tried EACH of these techniques for long durations after they were recommended to me, or researched online).SPREAD HOT SAUCE ON THE AFFECTED AREAS- DOES NOT WORK (hot sauce is loaded with salt, I could almost hear them laughing at night)PLACE MOTH BALLS and MOTH FLAKES around the base of your cabin and near the damaged areas... DOES NOT WORK- made no difference...still LOTS of damage....CLAD THE LOWER AREAS OF YOUR CABIN. They seem to like pressure treated wood and cedar less (they WILL still nibble on it), but metal is a deal-breaker for them, whether it be corrugated panels (our entire outhouse is now clad this way), hardware cloth (screening), or pole sleeves (metal). DOES WORK or at least slows 'em down...PAINT ON SOME USED MOTOR OIL WHERE THEY\"VE BEEN EATING- Nope... DOES NOT WORKHIGH SPEED METAL COMING FROM A GUN- DOES WORK, but you'll get new visitors in your territory soon enough....Fox Urine- seriously, they sell it online.... HAVEN'T TESTED, but I hear that they results are mixed, and you need to reapply at the base of your cabin frequently (and it stinks!).Porcupines are nocturnal too, so they can be hard to nab. They are very slow though, and have no real enemies, aside from the Fishercats, and fox, by occasion.Also (above)- \"MICROSHELTERS\" is my NEXT upcoming book- now on pre-order for a September release...."},

Its for this reason that I occasionally post on subjects that are decor, homemade-art, craft, or self-employment related- all of which DO fit in with the free-spirited, creative, and resourceful ethos of the tiny house movement. Running a cottage-industry business? Well, this idea might just save you some money, or save you in a pinch, when you're out of packaging, out of time, and just don't want to run to a store to buy factory-made mailers.So, here's a little money-saver that some of you who sell and ship through Ebay, Etsy, or who self-publish from home, might appreciate. These homemade mailer packages are EASY to make, as you'll see, cost nothing, and are made from recycleable materials you often already have right in your very home.Enjoy- and if you dig it, pass it on.... it'll keep a few more cereal boxes out of the waste stream, even if just for a bit, and prevent the need for plastic packaging, and the wasting of your hard-earned money....-Derek \"Deek\" Diedricksen"},

If you dig the blog, my videos, or anything I've done in the past, I'd HUGELY APPRECIATE IT! This TV show, which I host, design for, and build for, is finally airing! We shot this quite a ways back, so we're psyched to see it air!So…. as many of you might have noticed, my blog posts have become more and more infrequent as of recently. Why? Well, aside from bustin-butt and building things for clients, hosting several sold out workshops this year (Tennessee, North Carolina, New Hampshire, Vermont, and Massachusetts), AND getting a brand new factory-space for an art studio, and future design, art, and building classes, I've been working on THIS…..And it finally will air- episode one- as a hidden/sneak episode on SUNDAY, DECEMBER 14th- 1pm!   HGTV doesn't even list it (and isn't even promoting it at all), but it exists and will air. You'll see!A TON of work went into the first build you'll see- one that is part tree house, part tiny house, and part seasonal cabin, so I hope you'll enjoy it. Its an hour long program and one focused more so on building and design, and not the downsizing aspects of the scene.We build from the ground up, off grid, and with a very small crew. No kit houses, no hidden building crew, and no half-built shells to start us off. Its grueling, but the end result is pretty darn fun, unique, and loaded with character.Our crew: Aside from me….Dustin Diedricksen (my brother, and co-workshop host)Jim Shippey- Builder/tinkerer- who has been a teacher/presenter at many of my past workshops\"Creature\"- Carpentry animal and always there with a smile (no, not really)Johnny \"Milwaukee\" Lyman- Brew City salvage builder/designer (and former workshop attendee)Melissa Teper/aka DJ Melissa- former radio co-host at WBCN Boston, and interior designer.Phil Laplante- Salvage Pro and Barn Builder from NHSO…. Sunday, December 14th- 1 pm- HGTV…. don't miss it!By the way, we also will have a small one day tree house design and build workshop in my factory space in mid January 2015, and MAYBE, a larger hands-on class with a small backyard office build (in another big factory space) in that month as well. Keep checking www.relaxshacks.com for the updates, or if interested, leave a comment below and we'll get back to you when things are official!-Derek \"Deek\" Diedricksen"},
{"title": "Check out this TINY HOUSE Pallet Wood Door We Made! ", "date": "Wednesday, October 29, 2014", "text": "So at our last workshop (see our most recent post), we found an old door (a heavy duty oak one) that was behind a factory and being thrown out, and repurposed it. With a little love and elbow grease, plus a new paint job and some inset, recycled, forklift pallet wood, we turned this \"bound for the dump\" door around. Its all about seeing the potential in roadside junk, and realizing the money that could be saved, and the custom touches and look that could come from such a simple project.Check out this short video explaining what we did…. not rocket science, but it might spark some new ideas….If you want to join us at one of our workshops, our next on in North Carolina (near Wilmington) is bound to be ALOT of fun! TO Sign up, click on the banner link on the top of our blog (before Nov. 20, 2014)-Derek \"Deek\" Diedricksen"},

I thought the same myself, hence the name (until we think of something better!)Check out this cool backyard office/reading retreat cabin that we built outside Boston, MA this past weekend as part of our Relaxshacks.com Tiny House Building and Design Workshop (our TENTH one!). There were MANY demonstrated techniques worked into this one little structure (standing about 11' tall) from framing, cedar shingling, tongue and groove use, and constructing, leveling, and squaring its base, to trim work, roofing (Ondura), and installing a polycarbonate Tuftex wall. The project started as an A-frame, and then I decided on the spot, with a group consensus/approval, \"Nah, lets toss in a knee wall, give it a steeper back wall, and give it a modern, asymmetrical front supports\". So we did….The plans are never set, and we build, design, and decide certain things as a group, which is half the fun, If someone has a new or different idea, they can bring it to the plate and try to sell us on it.It was a fun, involved, and intimate workshop (capped off at only 16 allowed to attend), and the weather was GREAT!OUR NEXT WORKSHOP! SIGN UP (and find more details) by clicking the banner link on the top of this blog- (before Nov. 20th, 2014) MANY MORE PHOTOS, including the interior and other close up details (the AWESOME funky door we made, the pallet wall, etc) are coming soon!

So… CAROLINA BEACH, NC, near Wilmington, will be our next Hands-On Tiny House Building and Design Workshop! And WE WANT TO KEEP IT SMALL- smaller workshops mean more individual time with each attendee, which means they walk away with more experience, know-how, and with more time actually building.THERE IS NO QUICKER WAY TO LEARN AND BECOME INSPIRED THAN TO ACTUALLY PARTICIPATE IN THE DESIGN AND BUILD OF A STRUCTURE. To learn techniques, tool usage, and design principals, we'll all be collectively constructing a 12' long cabin on a lot near the beach, one that will have a wood stove in the end run, and which will incorporate a good deal of salvaged material in the build. Alongside the cabin, we'll build a small deck, pallet chairs, a workbench, and much more! Its going to be A LOT OF FUN! Decor and color-wise, we can have fun with this too!Above: A Cabin we worked on (one of FOUR) at our Vermont WorkshopEACH AND EVERY ONE OF OUR PAST TEN WORKSHOPS HAS SOLD OUT- so don't wait too long!ABOVE: One of FOUR micro-shelters that we collectively built at our last workshopThe two day, twenty hour course, is $335. Work packets, snacks and coffee, materials, and more will be included. We have a great roster of demos and guest speakers too, with more to possibly be announced. There is no camping at this particular workshop, but there is lodging nearby, AND a state park that is very close with camping is $20.Above: The Lunar Lander- a cabin we built at our most recent workshop, in just two days!We also might have an optional add-on third day for those interested- with continued building, an extra demo or two, and a few added perks.

He's helped with workshops in the past with us as well.My brother Dustin \"Dr. Demolition Diedricksen\" will be part of this too!TEACHER to student ratio is roughly FOUR to ONE- which is unheard of!

This one would be a great activity for kids and adults alike, or a simple gift for someone for indoor or outdoor use. As a cub scout den leader I've long considered starting a blog just on kid craft, scout meeting, and rainy day activity ideas- fun, creative ones- and I think a simple project like this would be EASY to do, and VERY, VERY affordable.For you tiny housers, and perhaps those with tiny wallets, this would also make for a great little piece of decor- and one that requires very little maintenance! (no water!). It would also be great for seasonal cabins where you want the LOOK of some greenery, but don't want to transport plans back and forth each season. Anyway, its just a simple post today, but I thought some of you crafters out there might be interested. -Derek \"Deek\" Diedricksen"},

The place is just gorgeous and they've already clocked in 3000+ miles on their road trip from California to Pennsylvania- which will then continue up to the maritime provinces (New Brunswick, Nova Scotia). Its quite a trek they're undertaking, and they'll be chronicling all of it on www.TinyHouseGiantJourney.com - so be sure to check 'em out.This video is actually the very first video tour they've done, and I was lucky enough to be behind the helm for it. Their home- 20' long, 8' 6\" wide, and 13' 4\" tall, is loaded with great space saving ideas, creative built-in furniture, and a ton of character overall. The video tour is long, but I think you'll enjoy it. These two also are bringing their dog on the road tour, which can climb and descend the loft steps on its own…. and the loft steps…. you'll be wowed!ALSO- October 25th-26th, 2014- we're having a small HANDS-ON Tiny House/Shelter Building Workshop… we'll have full details soon.

{"title": "The CUB SCOUTS building a tiny house/cabin?? Yup. ", "date": "Friday, September 12, 2014", "text": "Check this out if you'd be so kind- I'm heading up a fundraiser for Pack 24 on the South Shore in Massachusetts (where I'm Den Leader for the Wolf Scouts). I always enjoyed the Cub Scouts as a kid, and later went on to achieve the rank of Eagle through the Boy Scouts, so I'd like to give back to a local organization by building and designing a backyard cabin, office, playhouse, or seasonal tiny house of sorts- one that we'll auction off (and display publicly). Better yet, the scouts will help us build and design this, all the while learning to swing hammers, cut boards, paint, measure, and well, just BUILD things. There's no better way to learn than to just jump into the thick of things and actually do it, and that's always been the premise of my adult workshops. Plus, you never know, a fun activity like this could inspire one or two kids to become future carpenters, architects, or designers.     Check out the video above, it explains it all.     For the adults, I AM hosting another small hands-on design and building workshop in late October (the 25th and 26th- 2014)- one that will be limited to only 15 students. Why? I want to keep things intimate and be able to give each attendee a lot of individual attention and help. We'll actually have Dustin Diedricksen (\"Dr. Demolition\") as a co-host, as well as Jim Shippey, so the student to teacher ratio will be a very awesome five to one. You don't find that elsewhere!Yeah, again, its ACTUAL HANDS-ON BUILDING… LOTS of it… for all skill levels (which includes having NO building experience whatsoever). We'll have more on this soon! It WILL SELL OUT too…. EVERY single workshop we've done in the past has….and we've done LOTS of 'em.

The front \"futon frame\" window will also be covered in Tuftex. We'll add a recycled material deck out front, and a larger \"porch style\" overhang, potentially with a hanging chair beneath it. This little bunk house will also have its own fire pit for workshop attendees to use/enjoy. Oh yeah, THE ENTIRE inside will be WILD graffiti art!!! That front door is begging to be painted some funky color too.We now have EIGHT cabins and tiny houses on the camp land, which is great, as next years attendees will get to see them, and potentially stay in them….. a tree house, a micro a-frame, a nantucket-style tiny house in the woods, a cabin on stilts, a tiny shelter on wheels, and more!It was a ton of fun to work on, and down a trail in a neck of my property I've dubbed \"Freeform Junction\"- where we get to build without plans- its all off the top of our heads, and with the materials on hand- which makes for some GREAT problem solving, group dynamics, and a large dose of \"making due with what we have\"!ABOVE: An A-frame cabin we worked on as well… with scavenged and left-over materials too (about 60%)You learn more than you'd think from simple projects like this, which force you to not take materials and scraps at face value- which often leads to far more efficient and affordable tiny house builds down the road. Yes, this bunk house in the woods is hokey, but its supposed to be, and was a teaching aid that imparted quite a bit by way of approach, and salvage construction.The roof, the only thing NOT salvaged, is Tuftex- a kind of VERY durable polycarbonate roofing. www.Ondura.comAlso, we'll have more on it soon, but we DO have another micro-workshop coming up…. we'll have the registration links up pretty soon, but if interested in getting a spot early (these ALWAYS sell out), email me at kidcedar@gmail.com-"},

Anyway, I recently came across a great, sizable wooden cable spool, and plan on making one of these cool little tables, but perhaps one inset with some potted plants, or a bowl for odds n' ends.Wooden spools, if you look, can often be found for free. Legs like these (vintage mid-century modern hairpin legs) can affordably be ordered on ebay or amazon, and Ikea has a large selection of metal table legs too- some as reasonable as only $3 each. Of course you could make your own wooden legs as well, or use pipe fittings- which works great!The table shown above uses both halves (circles) of a disassembled spool, which were then screwed and glued together, sanded, and polyurethaned. The polyurethane isn't necessary, but gives it a nice shine.As for my spool, I'm not going to double it up, because I want to save the other half. Along with a mountain of lumber and weird salvaged items I've amassed, we'll be using it for something creative- alongside THREE hands-on cabin/tiny house builds in Vermont this August! This workshop's been filling up quickly, and its going to be GREAT! FOUR DAYS of wild creativity, fun, and camping!Photos from www.wearemfeo.com"},

Frame out a wooden border, lay the bottles as you'd like them, and pour in some concrete (ideally a kind with a binding additive). Then, once hard enough to remove the frame safely, do so, and wipe any of the concrete/grout haze from the exposed surfaces of the bottles.

(explanatory rough excerpt from the book)“The Pouting Shed” aka “The Stilted Sleeper”- Jay Shafer with Deek Diedricksen The “Stilted Sleeper” stands as the only collaboration plan set in this book, and one between myself, and friend, Jay Shafer of Sebastopol, CA. Shafer’s name is one well known in the small structure community, and he’s often been attributed to being a key founder of the modern tiny house movement- and for good reason. Jay has lived in a tiny house, has built and designed tiny houses, currently lives in a very small home with his family of four, and has taught well over a hundred building and design workshops nationwide. He knows his stuff and lives, eats, sleeps, and breathes. small structures, as do I. Its for this reason, and seeing as our background and tastes/styles are so very different, that we thought a team up design might be fun- “lets just see what happens”. There is actually a youtube video, speed-sketching and all, of the thought process, off-the-cuff, that went behind this little shelter under the title “Jay Shafer and Deek’s Stilt Cabin/Tree House”.  Check it out if you ever have the chance, it’ll add some more insight into things.                                                                                                          Basically, to break this down into a simple story, Jay, a pro in simplicity and efficiency, had been wanting to build a series of tiny, tiny, cubby-like single sleeping sheds, that could all be dispersed on a property for guests and friends. These would cost close to nothing to build, and would be erected without much time or effort. Myself, having built many similar, tiny, single sleepers or “escape pods” for reading, meditating, or as offices, jumped in and thought, “I love it, but lets make it a tad more out-there, fun, and whimsical- yet still on a meager budget”. The resulting team-up, is a stilted cabin, whereupon, the under-belly area can now be used as covered shelter for food-preparation, sitting, staying out of the sun or rain, or even as a parking spot for a full out picnic table. By lofting this simple gabled micro hut, we’ve now enhanced its window views, created a bit more privacy through its height, and have added potential safety from animals in the woods (and their damage to a structure while not attended). The only downside is that the structure now has to be entered by climbing a ladded, or steps, but we felt that disadvantage outweighed the other benefits. Additionally, aside from a built-in bench (facing a campfire perhaps) that could be added between the pressure treated stilts, this cabin's backside is also laden with storage shelves, and a back wall of Tuftex polycarbonate roofing as a windbreak, which also (as its hinged) flips up, and becomes and extended covered area. Its dang simple, but would work well and more than double your shaded workspace. Also, if you missed one of our recent videos on a plan-set that we're now offering, here it is….Thanks to Joe Everson from www.TennesseeTinyHomes.com for his help with this too!"},

It'll also serve as an introduction to mixing and setting posts in concrete- one of the 4,087 things we'll cover, and that you'll SEE at the workshop!Check out this video- shot in an otherworldly locale- the Matlacha, Florida studio and shop of Leoma Lovegrove ( www.LeomaLovegrove.com ) .

Myself and Lloyd Kahn (Publisher, Builder, Jack of Many Trades) were flown out to Charlotte as stage speakers for the weekend, and this show was just great- good people, fun exhibits, and a friendly staff! In the coming days I'm going to post some photos, and maybe a video or two that I shot out there.We also began building the prototype for a new cabin (future plan set to come) for a cabin design of mine called \"The Dart\"- it can be built for about $2000, uses much stock length lumber, and is simple and easy to build. Aside from co-presenting on the home-design stage, we gave a live building demo throughout the three day show- a \"Deek Diedricksen and Lloyd Kahn\" team-up of sorts….Anyway, this salvaged material usage/layering technique is similar to something we'll employ at the upcoming Hands-On Tiny House Building Workshop near Memphis, TN- April 11-13th, 2014 in one of the cabins we'll all collectively be building!

Some of the garden displays here are just incredible, the people are very friendly, the vineyards are sampling some great wine (Duplin Vinyards especially!- who proposed the possible idea of me building them a tree house down the road), and Lloyd and I have had fun talking to people about tiny houses, salvage-construction, and presenting together on stage. Its just an event loaded with great displays, talented people, and great presentations too- FOUR stages of them! I even bumped into a guy I know- Roy St. Clair from Tuftex and Ondura roofing, who is running a booth as well- Roy will be one of the speakers at our upcoming hands-on build workshop in Memphis, TN on April 11-13th.I've also been taking a ton of videos, doing a few interviews with people as well- and I'll post them soon- alongside another mini-guest-video from Andrew Odom of www.tinyrevolution.us  (not from the event)Anyway, we were supposed to be displaying a new mini-cabin called \"The Dart\"- VERY TALL, easy to build, affordable (under $2000 in new materials) at the event, and it was supposed to be built for me by a crew and ready for our arrival to showcase for interviews and tv. Well, things didn't work out that way and we arrived to find the thing FAR from done, so after borrowing what tools we could, Lloyd and I have been doing double duty working on the structure the last two days.It won't be done by the time I leave, but the event continues next week (and I believe its only $7.00 to get in- very reasonable) and a local carpentry crew will finish up some minor things for us. We are truckin' along though, and getting quite a bit done.I'll update you all later on things, but I'm now off to walk around the area to look for some good pizza.-Derek \"Deek\" Diedricksen"},

How 'bout it?\" I asked.\"Lets do it\", he replied. (Check out the work of David and Jeanie Stiles at www.StilesDesigns.com- GREAT stuff!)Below: One of the later pages of the plans, showing a cutaway for bed, sink, and rainwater catchment placement….Months and months later, as, well, we're both just a little bit busy with other projects, the plan set is now done, a prototype/1st version of the cabin has actually been built (in fact you'll see it at our Memphis, TN-area HANDS-ON, three day tiny house building and design workshop- April 11-13th), AND we shot a full video tour of that very cabin, which we'll have very soon on my youtube channel. www.youtube.com/relaxshacksDOTcomMeanwhile, here's a glimpse or two of the plans (11 pages in all- with another SIXTEEN full page photos to help you along too), which are now up and available as a downloadable version. We'll probably have a print version available too, or if you want one, email me at kidcedar at gmail.com.\"The Transforming A-Frame Cabin\"- Plans/Design by Derek \"Deek\" Diedricksen, sketches/renderings by David Stiles. The idea was to keep it AFFORDABLE to build, EASY and QUICK to build, and to have it so that it could be altered for different uses, or added to, rather effortlessly.The total cost for a cabin like this, soup to nuts, is right around $1200- and that's using city lumber pricing, meaning, elsewhere, it'd cost less to build. Add in some salvaged, free, or recycled materials, and you could EASILY build this under $1000.The plans, should you choose to pick up a set, also recommend, and explain, some other versions, or changes that could be made, so as to include more space, a bathroom, a larger loft, an easy addition/extension, and so on.The cabin's main base is 80 Square Feet (10' wide, by 8' deep). When its roof opens up and its legs are dropped down to transform one end of it into a porch with roll/drop-down mosquito nets that velcro in place, the cabin increases to 110 square feet.The standing room under the micro loft is 6' 5\", and while the loft is mainly intended for storage, you can fit/sleep one person in it if you like- I've done it.If you'd like to support us and pick up a plan set….-Downloadable PDF version- 11 pages of plan sets and instructions, and 16 full page photos to help you along your path. You also have an open link to ask us questions during your build. $29.95-PRINT VERSION of the plans- mailed to your door….US mailed- $40.00Canada- $45.00No Overseas for Print Versions- sorry…. its just too expensive to ship, and requires too much paperworkA BIG THANKS, I might add, goes to Joe Everson, of www.TennesseeTinyHomes.com and www.TinyHappyHomes.com. This is the very first time ever that I designed a cabin and didn't actually build it myself- I just didn't have the time. Joe and his crew built this cabin, in record time, did a fantastic job, and have allowed us to leave it on site of his tiny house workshop/compound in Tennessee, so that students at our April workshop (2014) will be able to see it- alongside 5/6 other cabins.Again- this cabin will be one of SIX or so that you'll get to see/tour at our HAND-ON TINY HOUSE BUILDING AND DESIGN WORKSHOP near MEMPHIS, TN- April 11-13th. We'll build THREE STRUCTURES together, hear from some incredible speakers, authors, bloggers, builders, architects, and designers, AND take a field trip to Beale Street one night!There's LIMITED SPACE- so before April 11th, 2014, sign up at the banner on the top of ANY page on www.relaxshacks.com-Derek \"Deek\" Diedricksen"},

While the winter here can really slow me down in terms of making any progress on the various cabins and tiny houses I've been working on, on the bright side, it does leave me a little time here and there to focus on fun, indoor, activities, as well- such as making this bizarre little modern-art piece out of an old kitchen cabinet door I had been saving for far too long. The old cabinet door (thrown out on the sidewalk from a neighbor's renovation) is adorned with a multitude of scrap wood from many projects in the past.Yes, I save just about everything, but its only because I know I'll always find a use for it.So the idea: Aside from being a wall hanging, made from salvaged and free materials that could add some color to a room, this repurposed-cabinet door could serve as a window covering, in lieu of a shade or blind, that swings to close a window, and when in closed mode, serves as interesting art. You could even decorate the inside of the door, so that when open, it stands as an art piece as well.Here's a closer shot, where it shows the 1960s/70s looking handle- one I left attached so that a clue as to what this used to be, would be evident.-Derek \"Deek\" Diedricksen"},

Get ideas by SEEING and DOING! There's no better way….-We'll have a Bonfire discussion and speakers at night, a BIG BONFIRE. Its a great, fun, and relaxed-atmosphere way to hear from our guest speakers, have a cold beverage or two, and get to know the people in your class. The networking of these events is more important that you realize, and you'll learn so much off one another as well.-A meet n' greet pizza party, with ice-breaking build demos night #1- with an emphasis on budget construction and utilizing salvaged materials.-Some GREAT guest speakers and teachers! See down below….Also on the workshop site, you'll see this \"Transforming A-Frame\", one designed by Deek (with plan sets for it available in the not-too-distant future). -You'll learn how to frame a house, set foundation posts, build and attach a tiny home to a trailer, various approaches on ground-bound dwellings, how to build with recycled materials, what materials to select, various methods and tricks-of-the-trade in construction, where you're allowed to live tiny, and HOW, and so much more!-You'll get to help build a mini rocket stove! And we just might cook up some grub on it.Upon Recycled Material Construction: Here's an example of an art studio ((\"The Periscope\") one with a sleeping loft above)) that Deek built out of 70% free and found materials. He'll tell you how and where to find materials, what to keep in mind, how to clean them, and what to pass up on.-Pick the brains of many carpenters, designers, authors, bloggers, and beyond- many of which have built several tiny homes in the past.-Take a group trip to Beale Street night two for some discussions, followed by fun- and GREAT live music in a city that's home to the blues!You WILL tour the inside of this tiny house near Memphis, and by doing so, you'll grab many, many ideas on furniture placement, space-efficiency, decor, and more. SEEING the tiny houses and cabins of others, first hand, is such a great way to harvest new ideas, and to get an actual feel of what its like, layout-wise, in these small homes. -See a demo on Deek's MANY methods for saving LOTS of money when designing a home. If you later utilize one of his methods, the savings alone, will more than cover/justify the cost of the workshop- and that's just one small facet of this weekend!-See a Mongolian Ger (Yurt) being set up right before your eyes- and possibly even get to stay in it! You'll have an option to stay in some tiny homes as well.Yep, here's ANOTHER tiny house you'll get to check out-Camp out with us and spend days AND nights talking and learning about tiny homes and small spaceliving.-Learn the \"DOs and DON'Ts\" of tiny house building and design- the Don'ts and mistake stories are just as important!ABOVE: THIS IS OUR NIGHTTIME CLASSROOM- This shot is from our last workshop in MA, but you get the idea. After a day of building and design, this is where we'll convene for discussions, guest speakers, slide shows, live demos, and perhaps a few cocktails if you want to b.y.o.b. These bonfires are a great opportunity to really get to know people and learn from one another!-Get tips on small kitchen and bathroom designs, and how to overcome the challenge of limited space.-Learn what to look for when selecting a building site- there's more to it than you think!Shot from the Memphis, TN work locale we'll be at…. yes, its a lil' tiny house haven! -Build and learn the basics, tools, and safety, with another one of our ice-breaking projects- constructing pallet furniture- adirondack chairs, saw horses, tables, and more- which you'll be welcome to keep. Bring a favorite paint color if you'd like too…. We made some WILD chairs at our last workshop, which attendees then used around the fire, and later took home.-HEAR from MANY other experts, and pick the brains of our guest speakers….their time is YOURS-Get a private video tutorial from Deek, and one from Steven Harrell, on tiny house related building and subject matter.Scene from our last workshop- a second side-project we worked on….a micro musician's studio/office-Be part of a video shoot for the youtube show \"Tiny Yellow House\".-Win a prize on our first night's \"UGLY ROCK BAND SHIRT\" contest…. bring a bad heavy metal wig for extra points! Runner up will get prizes as well- tiny house books, tools, a foot rub from Dustin (kidding)….OUR SPEAKERS/TEACHERS (and more to come!)DEREK \"DEEK\" DIEDRICKSEN- www.Relaxshacks.com- HGTV Host/Designer, Author of \"Humble Homes, Simple Shacks\", Blogger. Deek's cabins and designs have been cover-featured in The New York Times, The Boston Globe, Seattle Times, The China Times, Yahoo.com's homepage, The UK Daily News, and in countless other magazines, papers, and blogs. He also has done design work for The History Channel, CBS, The DIY Network, The WB, Make Magazine, and ABC Television. Aside from his own book, his cabins have been featured in the books \"Micro Green\"- by Mimi Zeiger, \"Tiny Homes, Simple Shelter\" by Lloyd Kahn, and will be in the upcoming book \"Water and Wheels\".JOE EVERSON- www.TennesseeTinyHomes.com and www.TinyHappyHomes.com, Joe's work has appeared in many blogs, newspapers, and on tv. He's EASILY one of the busier guys in the scene, having built an impressive amount of tiny houses, both on foundations, and on wheels. His work will be appearing in the upcoming book \"Micro Structures\", and on the show \"Tiny Yellow House\". If you're lucky, Joe just might bust out his Batman suit during construction!STEVE HARRELL- Steven's the man behind www.TinyHouseListings.com, and www.TinyHouseSwoon.com, runs his blogs and youtube show from an off-grid tiny studio (one we built and designed at another workshop of ours!), and is in the process of developing a cabin home in the woods of North Carolina- off grid. Want to talk about finding land, or space, for a tiny home? He's your guy. He'll be talking solar at the workshop, with a demo, and helping you build a rocket stove, among other things.DUSTIN \"DR. DEMOLTION\" DIEDRICKSEN- Dustin, a co-host, and co-carpenter, for ALL of Deek's past FIVE workshops (since 2010), is an Environmental Engineer/Toxicologist, a builder/designer of space efficient furniture, and lives in a small home with his family, one he renovated himself. His co-work with Deek has appeared in a variety of magazines, books, and tv shows. Want to know which salvage materials are safe to use, and which to avoid? He's the guy who has the answers.KARI COOPER- Kari's about as spunky as the come, and was at our last workshop in Massachusetts, where she demonstrated how a traditional Mongolian Ger Round House (a Yurt) is designed and set-up. You'll get to see, and even help, her set one up, and possibly even stay in it. She's very knowledgeable on the subject, and dang enthusiastic.WILL YOUNT- Will's Tiny House designs, from his company www.HummingbirdTinySpaces.com (based out of Nashville, TN), have graced many blogs, tour videos on youtube, and beyond. Another one of the harder working guys on the scene, Will's a wealth of knowledge when it comes to designing, and building homes on a budget. I hear he plays a mean guitar too….AND YES, WE'RE GOING TO HAVE MORE!!!Here's a video overview from a 2012 workshop we did- a video piece that MAKE MAGAZINE shot for us, which also aired on Vermont Public Radio/NPR… It gives the general/idea, or vibe, or these workshops…. (thanks to Jon Kalish for the interviews!)SIGNING UP- Again, these sell out fast, and space is limited, so don't wait too long….The THREE DAY COURSE- one with almost 35 contact hours, one dinner, and weekend-long snacks, drinks, coffee, and course materials, packets, and more is $399.Oh, we just may have some door prizes too!Joe Everson, and Steven Harrell, two of our hosts, in front of a mini-tailgating cabin, or weekend retreat cabin on wheels- one you'll also get to check out! CAMPING ON SITE is an option too…. details soon….AS is staying IN one of Joe Everson's Tiny Houses…. Joe will provide info on this soon.There are area hotels nearby too, and the build site is about 25 minutes from the Memphis airport. There are also several restaurants and stores a very short drive away.Once we get people signed up and closer to the date, we can talk amongst the group to share rides to and from the airport too. It has always worked well in the past.Workshop begins Friday at noon until 5-6 pm on Sunday. Friday and Saturday, the workshop, building, discussions, bonfire, and speakers will be all day and night…. This is not a 9-5 workshop, we often hang until midnight, talking shop, picking each others brains for ideas, answering questions, and just having great conversations around the fire.Refunds- Within 3 months notice, you'll get a full refundWithing 2 months of the date- 75% refundWithing one month- You'll get a credit to ANY of the other workshops we host….This is because many supplies, orders, reservations, rentals, and more- are based on our head count. Its also a time consumer to have to re-seek replacements for seats- time we'd rather spend on preparing for the event- which takes a MASSIVE amount of time and energy. So please plan accordingly, mark your calendars, and such, and you shouldn't have anything to worry about. Plus, its an event YOU DON'T WANT TO MISS!Any questions- email Deek…'Hope to see some of you there!!!!"},

", "date": "Thursday, January 2, 2014", "text": "Laura LaVoie, a busy member of the tiny house scene, recently released a book titled \"120 Ideas For Tiny Living\", and here's your chance to win a copy of the downloadable version…..What I love about Laura is that she's choosing the simple life so as to be able to do things her way- from the freelance writing she does for various blogs, to her own blog on her tiny house experiences (www.120squarefeet.com) with her partner Matt), and even a blog on her other love- GOOD BEER!Anyway, as for the book, just \"like\" us over at www.facebook.com/tinyhousehub, if you haven't already, and simply list a favorite book or two of yours, on the subject of tiny housing, or small living. That's it- then we'll randomly pick from those who entered.The way I figure it, even if you don't win, readers will still get a chance to hear of titles they might otherwise not have know of.Win/Win….We'll pick the winner in three days from the initial post on Facebook….AND FOR THOSE WHO ARE GRUMBLING TO THEMSELVES, \"Blah, I never have any luck so what's the point anyway!?\"- you can pick up Laura's book on Amazon.com as well- here's the link….Above: A recycled-material tree house I just built for a client- if you missed the video tour….http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMkfM5ldgJoMan, I just can't wait for spring here in New England, so I can get back into building, designing, completing a few projects….AND hosting our 2014, KICK-ASS HANDS-ON Tiny House Building And Design Workshop- 3 days, WITH Camping options, in Memphis, TN! Its gonna be nuts! AND I'll have the ticket info up soon…. the list of builders, authors, tv hosts, speakers, and designers that we're having as guest speakers is crazy AND you'll not only build and design two cabins, but you'll get to tour FIVE or so tiny houses! We'll build a rocket stove too, have a solar power demo, and the list goes on…..If you want direct info once its out, email me at kidcedar at gmail.comIt'll be April 11-13th….. and yes, there will be a side trip one night to Beale Street!We're limiting this to about 25-30 people to, so as to keep it intimate and to give each person individual attention. ALL skill levels are welcome- even those who have NEVER built anything.-------------------As for the designs….I've been wrapping up these cabins, which will be for sale soon….. many can double as art studios, tiny backyard guest sleepers or retreats, small yoga studios, reading rooms, or with a small added bathroom option, a seasonal little home for one even. You'd have to move 'em, and most shed moving companies can easily handle these with a flat bed truck.ALL FUNDS will go back into designing new cabins, and shooting videos on them, for our educational \"Tiny Yellow House\" show/series on youtube. These CUSTOM designs are also very on par, price-wise, with the really lousy, particle-board, junk-sheds you'd get from a big chain store, but these ones are well built, and one of a kind.Also, these can all be insulated VERY easily and affordably. And wired.\"THE PERISCOPE\"- $4500- $500 extra for a bathroom annex off the back. This one will have a laddered sleep loft as well…. its a little over 12' tall. (Not complete in the photo)THE RELAXSHACK- with a day bed/storage cabinets inside, and wall shelving- about 7' by 7', overhang CAN support a hanging chair too …. $2500The front cedar deck piece comes with it too…THE BREAD BOX- Musician's Hideout, Art Studio, Green House- 6' by 8'- 8' tall, tongue and groove flooring within, thick steel roof with a clear Tuftex combo, 36\" glass door - $2000These will all eventually be featured in my next book- a follow-up to \"Humble Homes, Simple Shacks\"- but VASTLY different in approach!"},
{"title": "Yard Sale Junk Meets A Space Saving Decor Idea…. for your small home! ", "date": "Wednesday, January 1, 2014", "text": "For all you musicians out there, I spotted this cool, simple idea over on pinterest, and might have to give it a…er…..spin sometime. LP Records can be found at thrift shops, yard sales, and flea markers everywhere, and oftentimes they can be as cheap as a quarter- so, why not grab one or two of 'em, in conjunction with a dime-a-dozen mini night stand, and with some adhesive combine the two?It'd make for a great gift for musicians, or for anyone with a hobby room of \"man/woman cave\".This idea especially works well as the nightstand's you'll want to look for are the ones with beat and scratched tops- in other words, the cheapest ones that people otherwise might not want. You'll often find these being thrown away on the side of roads too. Blast the legs with a coat of some colorful spray paint if you'd like, and that's all there is to it.Best yet, should your record scratch over time, just slap on a little more plastic/vinyl adhesive, and layer on a brand new record.I personally have an old copy of Ratt's \"Out Of The Cellar\", and its just begging to become a table…. which I think I'll be doing soon to show you how it came out.-Derek \"Deek\" DiedricksenDetails SOON on our next HANDS-ON Workshop- we'll build one, or TWO, little cabins!

I love 'em though. They're molded micro shipping containers as doll houses! The attention to detail is pretty decent too- I initially saw a few photos of these tiny houses and thought they were the real deal, well, scale-wise. The company responsible for these cool little doll dwellings…. Module-R, check 'em out.Happy New Year too!

It'd work great as a getaway vacation cabin, a mini studio, or a backyard retreat.As for this A-frame tiny house here, this is one I spotted earlier this year on a drive into Acadia National Park in Maine- right near Bar Harbor. This is the office for a cabin rental compound- little cottages you can stay in. I was in a hurry, and never got to see the inside, but the exterior is fun and inspirational enough- at least I feel so. Here's a shot of the sign as well, so if you're ever in that neighborhood, you'd be able to find the place, and take a peek inside.As for our April 2014 Hands-On Tiny House-Building workshop, we'll have some more details soon, and it looks like we MIGHT tackle constructing two little cabins again, start to finish- one a ground-bound mini cabin in the woods, and the other, a tree house..... still some planning to do, but that's the aim. Two projects ARE better than one, as we then get to divide the group up nicely, and more people get even MORE hands-on experience.kidcedar at gmail.com if you want me to send you the info direct when I get it. All of these workshops have sold out quickly in the past, and we limit the class size to about 25 or so.-Derek \"Deek\" Diedricksen"},

April 11-13th, 2014----------------   DESIGN STUDIO FOR A CHILDREN'S ILLUSTRATORLOVE this one, from the orange door, to the sliding wall that protects/covers the front windows. Its such a light, airy, and inspiring little cabin, one perfect for inspiration when it comes to its intended purpose- a design studio for a woman who illustrates children's books. It could make for a great tiny house too. Photo-wise, I haven't found anything showing a bathroom, but you can see a ladder going to  what I'd assume would be a sleep loft.     It was designed by Riley McFerrin and Hinterland Design Studios from Canada (Vancouver area), and here's what they had to say about this project:     \"When a children's book designer needed a workspace that was separate from the main house. The challenge was to replace the existing shed, located at the top of a steep hill, with a small studio that used its exact footprint. The homeowner wanted the studio to be small but airy, bright but cozy, inspirational yet modest. But most importantly, modern yet in keeping with the rustic charm of the country. Within a one-month schedule, and a very modest budget, Riley McFerrin and Hinterland Design Studio was able to do a complete demo of the existing shed, and provided design-build from the ground up with a new foundation, framing and finishes, new utilities, custom-built workspaces and interior millwork. They were able to incorporate salvaged windows, siding and doors, and repurposed timbers for interior shelving and storage. The studio, tucked into the trees, provides expansive views of the ocean through large windows that inject light into the space and provide inspiration.\"                -from www.HinterlandDesign.com -Derek \"Deek\" Diedricksen      IF YOU MISSED OUR RECENT STRING OF VIDEOS....

Its based on the idea of the flower pot room heaters that have been going viral online, but with a better twist, in my opinion. His video tutorial is pretty thorough, as he even takes timed temperature readings as the heater begins to warm up the room.Basically, this little space heater is made with candles, a metal paint can with holes drilled into it for air intake, with a cast iron skillet sitting on the pail (filled with broken bits of bricks), which has a cover placed atop it (for greater thermal mass and absorption).Check out the video, I think you'll enjoy it....AND, for those who missed my last video- A TREE HOUSE tour- one I built and designed just outside of Boston, MA- here that one is as well.Subscribe to our videos, if you'd like, at www.youtube.com/relaxshacksDOTcomWE HAVE ALMOST 100 VIDEOS NOW! My book...."},
{"title": "SHELVES and WALL-WORK AS ONE? A Space AND MONEY-Saving Building Idea....", "date": "Monday, December 9, 2013", "text": "JOIN our facebook group at www.facebook.com/tinyhousehub- we have new design content daily! ------------------So here's a quick shot of a cabin we worked on at my last workshop, one I designed. This photo won't do justice to how this little cabin will eventually look, not how it even looks today, but I wanted to share the simple idea/concept of dual-purpose wall framing.\"A LIBRARY POD\"\"The Bookshelf Wall\"- Pre wall and door trim.... The building process has been slow as I've been working in 20 degree (F) conditions....     This little cabin, a 6' by 8' solar cabin, greenhouse, art studio, or whatever, will not be insulated (it could be heated with the very smallest of electric heaters) so I've employed a technique called \"car siding\" (as they did on old train cars), where the exterior siding IS the interior wall too. To do so, I use good quality tongue and groove wood, silicone seal EACH junction (the tongue to the groove), generously waterproof or paint the exterior, and that's it! The result, while lower in R-value, is a better looking, easier to erect, wall. This works very well for off-grid building applications as its less to carry deep in the woods- one set of wall planks, as opposed to double that. Its certainly a money saver too.Now beyond that, as you can see in this photo, instead of framing the walls in a vertical-stud manner, I not only flipped the wall work horizontally, but framed this wall with two-by-SIXES, and not mere two-by-fours. By doing so, my wall is now also a large array of book shelves. I've additionally saved time, money, work, and space, by doing this.Above: You can see that one HUGE front window (almost 4' by 6') a large window in the door, AND the clear Tuftex polycarbonate roofing, brings A LOT of light into this small space, making it seem larger.Now you may be thinking, \"But Deek, won't the shelves sag?\". Yes, yes they will...but barely....that's why I'm adding natural wood brackets (simply de-barked vertical supports cut from maple tree limbs) to prevent this from happening. I'm working on whittling and polyurethaning them right now. These supports, in the end run, look great, cost just about nothing, and add a slight natural and rustic element to an otherwise very modern looking micro cabin/tiny house.This cabin, ultimately, will be for sale, with a charity tie-in, for about $2000 or so. Its HEAVY DUTY, and would make for a great weekend escape, or backyard studio. More on that soon, or kidcedar at gmail.com if you might be interested. Also, with the holidays around the corner, if you want to support me/us- check out my book! Thanks!"},

Out VERY FIRST stop, up in South Londonderry, VT was Domenic Mangano's \"Jamaica Cottage Shop\", and man oh man, was his spread impressive- something like 20+ sheds, cottages, cabins, and more. We did shoot some videos, and took a heck of a lot of photos for my next book (a follow-up to \"Humble Homes, Simple Shacks\") which you will see soon.Anyway, this is a nearby cabin compound that we unfortunately DID NOT have time to see, which bums me out to no end- check out these photos Dom sent!      \"This set up is owned by an older couple from the city\", said Jamaica Cottage Shop owner Domenic Mangano,      \"The woman, one of two owners wanted a very rustic look- all wood, lots of angles, very earthy. She is very distinguished, proper in a likable way, and very down to earth. She stated, early on, that she would not come up to this beautiful land they own, set high on a hillside in Vermont, unless there were some amenities present. As a result, each cottage is set with a varying degree of comfort. One is simply a cold shed with a wood stove, another is much more sealed up with minimal insulation, a direct vent wall mounted gas heater with a thermostat, and the last one is set up with a composting toilet. All in all, they're almost set up as his and hers and unisex cottages.\"Deek: I haven't gotten any interior shots yet from Dom, but hope to! Hopefully we have more photos of this place soon, so keep checkin' back! And with the holidays coming, if you haven't checked out my DIY, tiny cabin, house, and shelter concept book, its LOADED with ideas...."},

It is expected that the stunt actor, whose daredevil tactics have been featured in other such films as \"Meatballs 4\", \"Air Bud\", and \"Gigli\", will recover, but doctor's have reported that his road to recovery will not be a short one.      Slorgensen, as reported by his management firm, was also readying himself for work in \"Back To The Future 4\", with principal shooting to begin next month. The long anticipated Steven Spielberg-helmed follow-up has set internet film chat rooms aglow, and was to be the stunt man's largest role to date.

{"title": "Another look at Deek's Cabin On Wheels \"The Cub\"- MORE STORAGE ADDED.....", "date": "Sunday, November 24, 2013", "text": "Above: The new addition of an Ikea mini dresser ($45), and a built-in day bed platform (with recycled Ikea roadside desk panels as lids to its hollow interior), give \"The Cub\" (a mere 40 square feet) a lot more storage.... I'll show you the little food prep area soon too.... which doubles as steps to the bunk. ------------FIVE TIPS for MAKING A MICRO SPACE FEEL LARGER.....1. Make sure you're getting ample light, but while not sacrificing too much privacy. In this cabin we have a pair of openable windows, a fixed window, and the huge wall of light (covered in Tuftex polycarbonate roofing (the stuff bullet proof glass is made from!) that actually swings open to become a porch awning. This wall isn't transparent, but still lets in a huge amount of diffused light, making this space seem less claustrophobic than its 40 square feet. Yes, 40 square feet.2. Keep the interior colors light. The flooring is a prime example. Not only does this light-colored flooring give the room an airy feel, but it plays into the natural light entering the room, reflecting it to a small degree, and doesn't create the heavier, gloomier, vibe that a darker floor would.3. Look to \"Double Duty\" Items. The \"Day Bed\" platform, for example, is a platform to rest on, and watch tv from, perhaps (especially once cushions are later added), but it also is a shell harboring a very good deal of storage space. Out of sight, out of mind.4. \"Loft It\"- often vertical space isn't used as it could be, so if you can, look to loft, or bunk, set ups to position a sleep or storage area up beyond one's normal line of sight. As a result, you still SEEM to have the same exact living space below, and your visual space isn't encroached upon, but you've now gained additional living space.5. Hang a few small, attention grabbing, art pieces. People are a little less apt to walk into a tiny space and immediately exclaim \"Dang, this is small!\" if their gaze is drawn to a particularly colorful, or unusual, piece of art of other focal point. At this point, they've unconsciously become more accustomed to what would otherwise be considered a shockingly small space. Be careful not to hang pieces that are too large though, or the opposite effect comes into play.-------------------MORE BACKSTORY: Well, I haven't shot a video on this little cabin yet, as, well, it's not completely done. I'm getting there though.... while also finishing TWO other cabins that we collectively built at my Relaxshacks.com Tiny House/Cabin Design and Building Workshop last weekend. We ARE having another workshop, most likely in April- in North Carolina. This one will be off-grid, and loads of fun! Three days again- and HANDS-ON Building! This cabin, \"The Cub\", is something I'm going to finish for my in-the-works book, tentatively titled \"Micro Structures\" (The name of a book I started years back, but never finished).

{"title": "A porch wall made from recycled windows.... fun n' nearly free! ", "date": "Thursday, November 21, 2013", "text": "Here's a great find that was sent to me by Kari Cooper.... who also attended our Tiny House Building Workshop last week, AND brought her yurt out for display (we'll have a video on that soon).If you ever want to build a wall of windows like this, here are a few simple tips:1. Try to locate old discarded windows that still have their putty work intact. Loose mullions and putty can be a pain to fix, and some of the old crumbling putty might have asbestos in it. Better to leave it behind if it needs too much work and is becoming loose.2. DO make sure you further support the windows with vertical structural members. These windows can only be stacked so high when unsupported- gravity will eventually win and crack them, or worse.3. DO lay them out ahead of time to see how they might best fit together. This will avoid costly layout mistakes later on if you were to ad lib it, mess up, and have to start over.-Derek \"Deek\" Diedricksen"},

THE WORKSHOP IS COMPLETELY SOLD OUT, and has been for awhile, so if you wanted in, in late April, we're most likely going to be hosting a North Carolina full-out building workshop again (our last one down there sold out too). This one will have much more of an off-grid feel and focus, and will stand as \"Tiny House Summer Camp- Season 2\". Season One was the summer of 2012 in Vermont. Below is a video from Make Magazine on that camp weekend....As for this coming weekend, as a group, we're tackling TWO cabin designs....-One will be a new design of mine called \"The Relax Shack\"- which I'll eventually have VERY affordable plan sets for, and the other....-\"The Bread Bin\"- a half-rounded top cabin that resembles the bread bins of old....but with a very modern take/look to it. We'll have a plan set for that one down the road too, perhaps with some bad-arse artwork from Kevin Fitzpatrick of KLM Illustration as well.Both of these cabins will incorporate an enormous amount of free and salvaged materials. In fact, this  pre-built base of one of them (which has removable planks for now, so as to be able to show students how it was framed) was built with free and salvaged wood- all of it, except for three pressure treated 2by4's- which I could have probably swapped out with freebie wood anyway.SO, here's a look at the mere base, and in a week or so, I hope to be able to show you a MUCH DIFFERENT photo of this fun little backyard office/retreat/guest sleeper. Yes, the framing is unconventional, but it works- well, and we're still not fully done. Also, the second base will be built by the group.Oh yeah, EVEN THE INCH-THICK PLANKS WERE FREE (I got SO many of them from a guy getting rid of them that I really need to stop by his place and give him a really good bottle of wine or something!).Our workshops have been going so well that I've now added in a third host/presenter to help all our attendees along as well, and to make sure that everybody gets a very good deal of individual help and attention.

This all happened after a random hiker in the woods stumbled upon my cabin and made a call to the town's building department. Luckily I had used screws to build it and was able to take it apart, board by board and move it up a hill to were I was able to get a permit for it.Some of these are photos of the old location.I can get the new location photos from the same angles and that might be a cool hook for your book.-Jim MatusNOTE: I'm working on getting some interior photos of this place soon from Jim, do be sure to check back!

So wanting to use up more of my discarded junk and free pallets...and wanting an excuse to spend a day outside in the last of the beautiful weather, I decided to put together a free, functional bus stop. My kids also like to carry hot drinks and bowls of cereal with them in the morning and I was tired of mugs and bowls left in the mailbox.. now they have a dumping station AND a place to stay dry if it is pouring rain!  It is made up of four free pallets from a local hardware store, and an old peg board with a reinforced frame that came from my laundry room remodel, and happened to be the perfect size (which was on it's way to the burn pile anyway.

The lone cinderblock is no longer bearing the weight of this cabin, and will soon be removed (there is a post hidden behind it). Here's something I've been working on lately- a \"procrastination build\", while I should be working on other things.... I'm dubbing it \"The Periscope\" for now, as its so tall and narrow- and no, it won't tip over and is perfectly save. It can easily be anchored to the ground too.    When finished, it'll stand at over 13' in height, will feature a small sleep loft, and even a tiny bathroom with a composting toilet. It'll be heated by either a Dickinson Boat Stove, OR a candle (no, not really, but this thing is SMALL, and will heat up EASILY, even without being insulated- I'll later shoot a video to prove this). It could make for a very simple vacation cabin, or even a home for an especially minimal, and daring, individual. The front, tetris-like, framing also doubles as shelving, and a few other funky bells n whistles will be worked in too. For eventual sale/transport, the roof top half can be taken apart, while the lower cube would be pulled onto a flatbed tow truck. Price- no clue- maybe $5000 when its fully outfitted- it all depends on how crazy I go with this thing.It will be around, alongside 4-5 other cabins, AND a visiting Tumbleweed Fencl, for attendees to see at my upcoming Nov. 15-17th workshop here in MA.The front of \"The Periscope\" is covered with transparent, durable, polycarbonate roofing from a company/brand called \"TUFTEX\". This stuff can be doubled, back to back, for a better seal, and an increased R value through its creation of a sealed air pocket. Oh yeah, most of the materials used in this were free and salvaged from an enormous stretch of fencing that was blown down in Hurricane Sandy up here in Massachusetts. If you dig the recycled-material-building approach, and off-the-wall tiny shelter and cabin concepts, check out my book....

We'll be building and outfitting TWO mini-cabins this time. Fun!Speaking of which, here's a section of my small home that I \"funkily furnished\" with roadside crap and yard sale items. This blog is about diy tips and ideas in general, in addition to tiny houses and cabins, but it often dips into the realms of repurposing items, yard sale thrift, and heck, even dumpster diving. Yes, (shock! shock!) I have gone dumpster diving before- Love it, in fact.... its a pretty bad-ass counterculture/underground movement with some GREAT books on the topic as well (check out the hilarious and very informative book \"The Art And Science Of Dumpster Diving\"). I don't need the money, or am cheap, I just dig the concept and ideology behind it.    Anyhow, what you see here is....-FREE console table I found on the side of the road that I painted black ($0.99 spray paint), added new pulls to ($1.99 at Ikea, and I only needed two of the four in the package), and gave the drawer a coat of green I had laying around (lets call it $2.00 of paint).-Vintage Drafting Light- $1.00 at a yard sale. If I wanted to, I could easily resell this on craigslist for fifty bucks or more. I do a lot of American Pickers-style junk-flipping for profit and fun on the side, and many of these items come and go from my household- which does keep things rotating and interesting.-Weird wall hanging/art piece made from scrap junk wood. These were leftover small pieces from wood that was already scavenged and free. The paint was from random cans I already owned, but in such small amounts that it can't have cost more than $5.00.-Ikea storage stool. This actually wasn't supposed to be here in this set-up, but snuck its way into the photo. It is colorful though, and handy as a mini-seat, or step stool, WITH storage. I think it was $19 or so a ways back.-Ikea solar light. In the photo it looks like the large drafting light's little orange \"light baby\"- the only reason I tossed it in. These solar lights are pretty cool though, and come in several colors. I can't even tell you the name of them- something \"Swedish\" I'd imagine- hyuk, hyuk. For each one you buy, Ikea sends one to a third world country for students (who otherwise don't have adequate lighting) to study-by at night. It is very bright. But enough on Ikea, because they were mentioned in the last post too, and people will think I'm paid to plug them- I'm not. Cost: $15.00 last year.Style-wise, its not for everyone, but it has worked for me, and its look I dig- wild colors, the concept of this stuff being saved from a landfill, and it costing me so little.-Derek \"Deek\" Diedricksen"},

We'll be building TWO little cabins this time.       -------------------------So I've been bustin' butt working on completing a book that I began working on years ago, and I'm at the photo collection and organization stage right now. New publisher, new approach, new ideas. This book will showcase a TON of the more recent things I've built and designed, things I'd LIKE to build via funky concept sketches, several full-out plan sets for micro-structures, AND will serve to showcase a good deal of work from others as well. I'm always looking for new photos and unique cabins to incorporate as well (fewer wheeled cabins than ground-bound ones at this point) so if you have any work you'd like to share- kidcedar at gmail dot com. Thanks!So here's one photo (from a set that will be in the book) of Matt Wolpe's former home. While this is seen as mere \"eye candy\" to some readers, there is always A LOT to learn from even one single photo when it comes to design and space efficiency.So here goes....1. Color Choice: Matt's use of light n' bright colors, and his leaving the majority of the wood natural in its \"pale\" state, gives the room a larger feel than the small space it really is. If he were to have painted the walls dark purple, for instance, it would result in a more claustrophobic-feeling dwelling. You can certainly add darker colors, I'm not saying that fun and personal preference is outlawed, just incorporate them here and there in trim work, and limited patches- if you want to maximize the spacial \"feel\" of your home, that is.2. High Shelving: Its out of the normal range of one's \"Walking eyesight\", and thereby doesn't clutter your vision when entering a room, AND still stands as a means to store a good many things. Its so easy and cheap to install plank shelving like this too. You can hang items, such as Matt's coffee cups, beneath such shelving as well.3. The Chalkboard: This can be put to use both as a visually interesting element when hung on a wall, especially if one were to \"gussy up\" its frame, but its also a means to keep your \"to-do\" lists and notes organized and in one designated spot- as opposed to having them spread all over the place via post-it notes and scraps of paper. Magnetic chalk boards are even better.4. Shallow Kitchen Shelving: With this method, every thing is visually available, and you don't have to rearrange and remove items in order to get to other jars and cans that might be stuck in the back of deeper shelves and cabinets. Shelving like this, and its seen contents, if set-up properly (notice how Matt has everything organized into nice, attractive mason jars and bottles) can be appealing to the eye as well.5. The Steps: These might have been the first thing you noticed. These steps, while probably not a great option for those advanced in their years, are a great space saver in their cantilevered design. I'd personally affix a small storage cube hanging beneath a few of them, but that might also come at the cost of sacrificing visual space.6. Visual Space: Yes, I just \"spoiled\" this one in #5, but keeping open visual space is important. Not every table and surface needs storage beneath it- there has a to be a compromise somewhere. I'm a fan of semi-chaotic design via LOTS of wall art, shelving, and attention grabbing knick-knacks, but that can be detrimental to the feel of a space. Remember to keep yourself in check in this regard when outfitting your home.7. Open Storage: This ties into #4, but notice the open shelving at the end of the kitchen counter. By boldly leaving the items open and present to the judging eye, Matt is forced to keep his items and clutter to a minimum- its forced downsizing management, and a reason to continually keep on top of neatness.--------------------By the way, being a half-starving author myself (\"Humble Homes, Simple Shacks\", and a eventually to be re-released expanded version of \"Quick Camps And Leg Cramps\") I might add that Matt Wolpe recently released a GREAT book on building a variety of VERY, VERY funky (pardon the pun) chicken coops.

One house I had extra time to hang in though (he was generous with his good whiskey, and made good conversation ta boot) was that of Joel Fleck. Joel's house had some really inventive, and effective, design elements, and I wanted to share a few photos I took. I've recently read that its somewhat based off the Tumbleweed Tarleton design, but whatever the case, its a great house, with a lot of thought put into it, and a wealth of Joel's own touches- there's no doubt of that. Thanks for the tour Joel!

Joel's sleep loft is accessed by a hanging ladder that can be stowed above when not in use. Its not something that will work for everyone, but he's a young dude, and can manage easy.

The windows you see in the background were found on the side of the road.... they're double paned sashes, that I later build frames for and fabricate into awning windows- very, very inexpensively.      IT STARTS AS A MESS, but saves time by saving the circular saw cuts until all is laid out and fastened.... see below. If I were to miter cut EACH board before screwing it down, it'd take four times as long, and still might not be as uniform and neat in appearance. This method is FUN too, as you go from an uneven layout, to something almost immediately better looking in a matter of minutes! Just drop a chalk line from one end of the cut to the other, once you've sighted the board edge underneath (the 2by4s), and after setting your circular saw to a depth barely greater than the stock you're cutting, make your pass. This is one of about 117 time and money saving tips (literally, I've been making a list) I'll be talking about and putting to use while we build TWO cabins, as a hands-on group, at my November 15-17th Relaxshacks.com \"Tiny House Building and Design Workshop\".

Just the other weekend I taught a tiny house building/design workshop for Tumbleweed, and had an absolute great time out there, in a town, and area, that is absolutely beautiful- this made the recent news of the floods all that more vivid and shocking....I was JUST THERE.... I just wanted to post a heartfelt thank you to the amazing group of around fifty people we had at the workshop- a class where I had the chance to introduce a new, in-the-flesh, framing demonstration, which I had a lot of fun doing. The workshop was loaded with some very friendly and talented folks as well, and big thanks goes out to Justin, who brought his own self-designed tiny house out to share, and to Dave, who is in the process of building a Tumbleweed right now. Good people, good questions, good conversations....and again, I hope you're all ok! Boulder, thanks for a great workshop, and hang in there- you're in our thoughts. Boulder is my last scheduled Tumbleweed workshop for 2013, but I hope to hit (or re-hit) a few cities in 2014- Chicago perhaps, Nashville, and who knows where else....(usually cities with a great reputation for live music, if you haven't noticed a pattern)'Hope to see some of you on the road!  Also, I have a workshop of my own on November 15-17th in Canton, MA- its a fully hands-on workshop where we'll be building and designing one, or possibly TWO, small cabins, and hearing from many great guest speakers, builders, and bloggers.

They should be solid wood doors, exterior grade is preferable. The size of the doors will determine the dimensions of the floor and the height of the structure. If you are finding used doors the opposing doors should be the same width. Door heights are fairly standard but pay attention to that as well especially if using used doors.Once the position of the doors has been determined the size of the platform can be decided. We made the side approximately 10″ wider than the total width of the two doors to allow for the cumulative width of the three studs and extra  on the outside corners. 1.  Begin by setting four concrete pads level with each other and set so that the outer edge will be even with the outside of the floor framing. Plan for at least 1 1/2″ pressure treated shims on the pad. Pads for the step (s) can also be set. 2.   Construct  the cedar floor  six feet wide and 10″ inches longer than your two doors measure. If two 34″ doors were used on the side the length would be 34 + 34 +10 = 78″. 3. The 2″ x 6″ cedar frame can be laid out so that the outside tip of the of the 2 x 6 is as wide as the floor.  There is a 2 x 6 ridge beam under the the round ridge pole.   Once the size and angles of the sides has been determined cut 2″ off the top tip so the framing will cradle the pole used  for the ridge.  4. The doors are resting against  2″ x 2″s which are screwed to the inside of the walls studs. The strips were attached 2 1/2″ in from the edge so the framing would protrude above the door.  5. Assemble and brace the A frame pieces. Fasten the studs with screws into the floor and ridge piece.   6. The painted doors can then be laid into the spaces and screwed to the framework.  7. Attach the cedar post ridge pole. Let the ends protrude if you wish.   8. If needed the step can be made from 2 x 6″ cutoffs. This can be set on a pad and screwed to the floor joists.   Build the frame slightly smaller than the 24″ x 11″ tread.  9.  The four corners have a cedar log attached which finishes the corners and makes a usable seat. This is notched to fit over the corner of the deck. Fasten to the deck with timber screws. - See more at: http://www.play-scapes.com/#sthash.x0dm8zZV.dpufDIY Recycled Door PlayhouseThe doors are the first item to be purchased or found.

This cabin, dubbed \"The Darrington\" (a nod to Kevin Harrington from www.cozyhomeplans.com) also has a sleep loft that fits a queen-sized mattress. Steven has since dryed in the loft, and is getting somewhat close to moving into the place, where he will then peck away at the interior needs and details.

{"title": "Loft AND Bunk Beds in a Tiny Cabin/House- One PHOTO- TEN things I dig...", "date": "Monday, August 26, 2013", "text": "Here's a great shot from ONE of MANY cabins that the Blue Moon Rising tiny house compound (a retreat and educational center) has on its property. You can rent these out to get a taste for tiny house and cabin living- perhaps to see if its right for you/feasible. I really think this is a GREAT approach: Stay a night at a tiny cabin or rental listing, or two/three, and get a feel for what works, and what doesn't, first hand. I've stayed in several listed micro-properties, and its money well spent!    Anyhow, from this one single photo, here's what I really like with this particular set-up/design....                                             www.bluemoonrising.org for more on this cabin.... 1. The loft serves as saved space for additional sleeping, but does not dominate the room, and as a result downplay the overall size and spaciousness (especially vertically) of the room. 2. The loft has safety railings for those who toss, turn, and sleepwalk (ouch!). This does close in the feel of the loft and you do lose some visual freedom as a result, but for many, it might be a trade well worth it.3. The recycled barn board cladding give the room texture, interest, and color- all in one, AND probably saved them a bundle, cost-wise. Note: always be wary of lead paint though- know your source of wood. 4. You can't really STAND where a bed resides during the day, so its \"space lost\" in an upright sense, so why not consider putting in bunk beds? You can still recline, nap, and read on them during the day. 5. Each bunk has its own window- a huge plus. In terms of natural light, ventilation, and a view (a tricked expansion of space), its a \"win\" on all fronts. The bunks, in so darkly colored a room, might otherwise feel cramped, depressing, and too isolated. 6. The ladder isn't completely vertical AND has a small hand railing on it (tough to see in the photo). This makes getting to the sleep loft easier AND safer.7. The loft has its own decently sized window. You NEED airflow and light in a loft, otherwise it feels like a tomb, or could end up one, should a fire break out below. This window appears to be just big enough for egress by most, and is pretty classy in its framing too.8. Plenty of storage space under the lower bunk. With storage space in a tiny house, you'll want to take all that you can get. 9. The red, bold, trim, would be easy to make yourself, and darn inexpensive, and its still effective and pleasing to the eye.10. The bunk nook appears to have a copper rod for a pull-across privacy curtain. Simple, but it works, and is a \"must\" for those who need to tolerate early risers.My Book....-Derek \"Deek\" Diedricksen"},

{"title": "Salvaging For Your Cabin/Tiny House/Self-Built Home.....", "date": "Wednesday, August 14, 2013", "text": "Today's post/discussion is on hardware, most specifically door knobs. I just recently flew out to San Francisco for a guest speaking gig at a Tumbleweed Tiny House Workshop to talk about recycled-material building- a means to keep a vast array of material out of landfills, and a vast array of cash IN your wallet. It makes perfect sense to me, yet time and time again I find people giving this notion the \"its not worth my time\" shrug off. Well, that's fine by me, as it leaves more to salvage for the rest of us I suppose. No, really though, you should rethink this and give it a shot! Hear me out....The workshop was a blast(!), by the way, and was led by Pepper Clark, and Ella Jenkins. I also got a chance to tour Ella's super-funky tiny house (a video, and photo gallery coming soon!) MY SEAT VIEW as we're getting ready to take off from Boston to Augusta, Maine. Anyway, while returning to Massachusetts, via Maine, in a tiny, tiny Sessna airplane, (A mere eight seats! see photo), I soon after hit Searsport, Maine. While there, at a junk/antiques barn (one of MANY), I stumbled upon this simple display of vintage door nobs for sale- YES, the kind that are overlooked on a daily basis when it comes to discarded construction materials on the side of the road, and homes being torn down. THIS STUFF CAN BE FREE. THE CHEAPEST vintage knob set on this store rack ran for $15.00. The rarest of them, FAR higher- and this is stuff I find for nothing all of them time. Actually a lot of the stuff I've found is better, and might fetch higher dollar. With a little elbow grease, you can add a vintage and unique touch to you home for almost ZIP, keep these non-degradable materials out of the waste stream, AND even sell the excess ones you don't want or need on ebay or craigslist- I have- many times. Heck, even if you have to fork over the cash for these items, I feel its STILL worth it, as you'll gain a look, and added character, to your home- one that others will not have. If you can't find them for free, flea markets are another great place to look- cheap, AND you can even haggle the prices down. Hinges, hooks, latches, and more- it just may be out there waiting to be harvested. You may not save a fortune, but each piece you utilize will be far more interesting and unique than the roster of hardware you'll find in any hardware chain, and each piece may just have an interesting story to tell. How to find it? I don't really even go out of my way. Truthfully. I just keep my eyes peeled when I'm driving around and always have a screwdriver or drill handy (to back out the screws on any hardware I might desire). Even if you spot a busted, junky, hollow-core door, it just may be harboring some free hardware. ABOVE: Inside the labyrinth of \"TREASURES and TRASH\"- A GREAT junk mine where I spotted the array of door knobs. The owner was friendly, and I wish I had hours to poke around in this place! You can find more on this store here.... http://www.downeastindepth.com/treasuresandtrash.html All in all, aside from the money saved, what I love about salvaged building goods, is that I can have friends over, and while sitting enjoying a beer or two, I can point out, from a single vantage point, not one or two, but a few dozen items and building materials that have been salvaged, and put to good, creative, use in my home. NONE of these items would ever be found in a hardware chain store, and all of 'em make for a funky and original look.Advantage: Deek If you'd like to read more on some of my recycled-material-building ideas, there are \"more than you can shake a stick at\" (whatever the heck that old saying is supposed to mean!?) in my book \"Humble Homes, Simple Shacks\". -Derek \"Deek\" Diedricksen"},

Wait, a sec, that's me!? Yeah, I felt I'd start off with my own book, simply because it IS the embodiment of all my past tiny house influences and interests, AND has a heavy emphasis on building with \"NOTHING\"- meaning, with salvaged, recycled, and free materials. Its not a conventional build book, and more an idea book, but LOADED with information if you take the time to go through it, and all its captions. 2. 'TINY HOUSE FLOOR PLANS\"- by Michael Janzen. This book delivers exactly what the title suggests- over 200 floor plans for a variety of different sized tiny houses. I recommend this book for those who aren't as good at spatially visualizing things- this book lays it out for ya. There's almost no text at all, but the layouts are pretty clever, and helpful to many. Where the heck can I fit a bathroom, or a dining table in 120 square feet?? This book kicks many an idea your way. 3. \"The Small House Book\"- Jay Shafer. I've become jaded over the years, having seen the photos of the work of Tumbleweed so frequently, but the first time I opened this book- \"wow\". This one has gorgeous layouts, given via some great photographic work, AND the basic bones of what you need to know to build a good chunk of your tiny house on wheels.4. \"Tiny Homes, Simple Shacks\"- Lloyd Kahn. These top ten are in no particular order, but if so, this one would be near the top. 1600+ color photos, coffee-table style, showing you the ins and outs of some WILD micro dwellings, are bound to inspire anyone. Its a dang-dazzlin' array of funky craftsmanship- in the mini sense. If you don't dig this one, have your doctor make sure you're not dead from the neck up.5. \"Tiny, Tiny Houses\"- Lester Walker. This was my FIRST introduction to the world of tiny houses back in 1986 or so, and I've been obsessed since. Its a little more expensive than the other books, but VERY, VERY worth it. This book also gives mini layouts and floor plans of each featured cabin, and covers some classics, from The Thomas Jefferson honeymoon suite, to H.D. Thoreau's Walden Cabin, The George Bernard Shaw revolving hut, and even some great designs from Walker himself. It also has my all-time favorite tiny house- Jeff Milstein's \"Bolt Together House\".6. \"Cabins\" (or \"Rustic Retreats\")- David and Jeanie Stiles. I only wanted to pick one book from the Stiles duo (they're all great) and it was a toss up between these two. The drawings are straight-forward, unbelievably solid, fun, and the ideas are very creative. These books are laden with concepts for building on a budget too! I'm currently working on a tiny cabin plan set with David Stiles ta' boot....coming out soon! 7. Sheds: The Creative Homeowner Series. This book is out of print, but can be found easily online- and cheap! Since tiny houses parallel shed structures in several ways (at least as a starting point) I feel this is a great book for those who haven't built before. \"Sheds\" offers some easy to follow concepts, directions, and great sequential photos. This book shows you how to build a small handful of sheds from start to finish. Its an easy read, and full of information for any novice- but not in an intimidating way.8. \"Compact Cabins\"- Gerald Rowan. 60+ cabin concepts- many designed for off-grid use? Need I say more. This is also not a \"step by step\" book, but has some really decent ideas, and is a fun book to flip through time and time again. The back of the book has a really good chapter on ideas for space efficiency too! 9. \"The Tumbleweed Books of Backyard Sheds and Tiny Houses\"- Jay Shafer. Its an expanded edition of \"The Small House Book\"- again, with some great photos, and some preliminary layouts for several of the then-newer models from TW.10. \"Cabins and Vacation Houses\"- Sunset Press/Books. This books is dated in most of its styles and decor, but there are still so many incredible space saving, and funky ideas, within. Its another book that is sadly out of print, but can be had for very little on amazon, or elsewhere. Black and white photos, but they still are great!

There we had a couple Alberta brews and ate some of Bre Smith's killer ribs, before taking a chance to explore the rest of the city. I've never seen SO many VW buses in a city- Joe and I lost count after awhile. The HUGE Folk music fest happening in town had something to do with it, but the locals informed me that the climate, and lack of harsh winters, is easy on classic vehicles, and one of the reason we would spot so many. I believe this color is called \"Ghostbusters/Slimer Green\". Love it! The group of people we had for this class were GREAT, and we also got to hang with/hear from....Darren Anderson from Vancouver's VREC SOLAR- a great and knowledgeable guy (www.vrecsolar.ca) Below- Austin Hay (who built his Tumbleweed Tiny House at age 15), hams it up inside the bus....he also was in town to hang/work/guest speak on his experiences with building tiny.

Apparently, this WAS used as living quarters at one point, and has quite the lengthy history- regardless, its quite the cool n' cozy little backyard cottage/shed. I originally saw it in \"This Old House\" magazine a year or so ago. Love it, and I wish I had more photos to see and share.THE HISTORY BEHIND IT (from T.O.H.)      \"This shed, built on our property in 1930, was originally a playhouse and then used briefly as a home. My husband, Bob, and I relocated it and turned it into a garden shed.  The color scheme was inspired by the orange quartz and gray schist on our 1809 stone house.\" Nancy Jordan Thornton, PennsylvaniaWHAT I WOULD DO WITH IT.....  Here's a simple scan of a sketch I whipped up, showing a few simple, space-saving ideas on how to fit a bed, a toilet/shower, and a food prep area, inside what appears to be an 8' by 8' structure. Note: The opening to the loft could be as small as 2' if you'd like, giving you even more sleep and \"hang\" space up above. I have it at 3', so as to leave more visual space- which tricks the mind into thinking a dwelling is bigger than it actually is. The loft could also be placed with its opening at the FRONT of the cabin, and with a wall ladder near the food prep area. CLICK on the sketch below to ENLARGE it....                                                               -Derek \"Deek\" Diedricksen"},

Its name is a nod to Kevin Harrington of www.CozyHomePlans.com, who has helped me out with many videos in the past. Its the \"D\" from \"Deek\", and \"Harrington\" combined, and, well, there ya' go. This is something we collectively built at a hands-on Tiny House Building Workshops I organized/hosted earlier this year, alongside Steven Harrell (shown, of www.tinyhouseswoon.com) in North Carolina. Eventually, the front swinging wall will be trimmed out nicely, a loft window will be in place, and Steven will be that much closer to being able to relocate his office into this little house.  In this shot, you can see that Steven has picked up where our class left off and is now filling and framing the upper walls of the loft. This loft area is about 4' high inside, and will fit a queen mattress. The clear front wall of this cabin also flips open to become a porch roof of sorts. When this wall is in its \"downward mode\", the purlins, or wall supports (2 by 6's) can be used as shelves- and were designed for this purpose. Eventually, when this cabin is complete, Steven will use it as an office for his www.TinyHouseListings.com blog- a realty website focusing solely on tiny houses, cabins, yurts, bus conversions, and even tree houses. Once finished, we'll also put together the funds to do a professional video shoot and walk-through on the place, so as to describe the design and the methods we used. -Derek \"Deek\" Diedricksen"},

These, once upon a time, were probably camps or roadside motel-style cabins. There were over a dozen of them in all, most of them identical, just sitting there, not being used. Some of them had sagging roofs, while others looked to be in rather good shape. The driveway to them was chained and blocked off, but there was a main office/home building, that was being lived in.     Here's where I would do some door knocking if I were looking for salvaged materials (while careful not to get shot!), OR to purchase and move an entire cabin (as a whole, or piece by piece). I'm sure one of these could be had VERY cheaply, and heck, they're not being used, so chances are the owners might sell one, or all of them.     There are also so many of these kind of rundown cabin camps in NH, VT, and Maine, and here might be an opportunity for a tiny house village, one more environmentally friendly, and more affordable, as all the houses are already there, these micro-structures are grandfathered in, and the materials are already on hand.   Just an idea....one that'd need some \"elbow grease\" of course....As you'll notice, the houses are only up on cinderblocks, so you could remove the porch, separate the back addition, and haul the main body of the cabin on a large flatbed rental tow truck.

If that approach still fails, when selling or photographing a pallet chair like this, stick a gaudy pink flamingo next to it so as to distract people away from the clumsy details. Kidding.....well......More on the chair....So yeah, I pretty much have what amounts to ADHD, but I've managed to put it to creative/good use. At any given time, while I should be completing some other project, I have a desire to start a new one...such as this lil' heap o' DIY, recycled-material, procrastination- a reclining garden chair made from re-purposed forklift pallet wood, barn planks, and 2 by 4 leftovers from a HGTV shoot I was hosting in Boston the other month. Yeah, I hate throwing things away, especially when they can be cobbled into weird furniture and sold for family pizza money (and then some). I'll probably sell this one, once coated, for $85.These chairs are sturdy! We once dropped a car on one for a gag in a how-to video for NYC's Make Magazine, and had to re-shoot the scene- the chair wouldn't budge and started knocking the Mercedes off the car lift!

This is something I talk about both at the Tumbleweed Tiny House Company Workshops I teach, and at my own Relaxshacks.com classes. It is also something today's guest poster, Carol, specializes in:TINY HOMES WANT GREATOUTDOOR ROOMSGuest blog post by Carol Venolia, Architect (www.comehometonature.com)I believe that the ideal living situation is a tinyhome—cozy, well-designed, delightfully meeting basic needs—surrounded byoutdoor rooms into which one can expand as the weather allows.I don’t just mean having a deck. A decks is a flat surface thatkeeps outdoor furniture from wobbling, but it leaves you impaled on whateverthe weather happens to be. The deep green art of outdoor placemaking involvescreating micro-climates in which we can be comfortable in a range of weather, whilenurturing wildlife habitat so that we’re surrounded by the sensory nourishmentof greenery, birds, butterflies, and bees.CreatingMicro-climatesBefore the advent of central heating and cooling, ourancestors relied on some basic climate modifiers to keep them warmer in winterand cooler in summer. We can revive these tricks and tools today to keep uscomfortable without burning fossil fuels.For winter warmth, design for passive solar heating: let inthe south sun from about 10:00am to 2:00pm, and soak up that sun’s heat withthermally massive materials like stone, brick, or concrete. With the additionof a roof, overhang, or vine-covered trellis, the same space can stay cool insummer, as the thermal mass soaks up body and ambient heat.For additional cooling, add even deeper shade, introducewater and transpiring plants nearby, and channel breezes toward your outdoorroom.The trick is to notice what your site hands you: sunshine,breezes, vistas, slope, water, plants. Then determine which of these you wantto let in, and which you want to block, and design an outdoor structureaccordingly—a roofed screened porch for bug-free shade, a stone patio forbasking in the sun, a solarium for winter warmth that can also heat your tinyhouse.Enhancing Wildlife HabitatOutdoor living is even more fun when you’re surrounded by anature paradise--and you can create your own. By addingbasic habitat elements—food plants, water, shelter, and territory for raisingyoung—you can nurture the web of life while surrounding yourself with birdsongand lush plant life.To learn more about how to do this in your region, check outhttp://www.nwf.org/Home/How-to-Help/Garden-for-Wildlife.aspxLearn MoreIf you want to go deeper with this subject, please visit mywebsite (www.ComeHometoNature.com). Here are two fairly mesmerizing videos to get you going with some outlandish ideas for your own home, whether it be tiny, or monstrous. Either way, I love the use of recycled materials in the case of the plastic cup lamp shade (its so easy too, although a little large), and the over-the-top, yet simple, approach of the log-into-a-shade video, which is just fun to watch! Enjoy these videos three.....Yes, I post on a lot of DIY decor projects too, aside from tiny houses and shelters- its what I'm into, and there are so many great design ideas I want to pass on to you guys. Don't worry, more tiny house stuff is coming soon, as I've been VERY busy building and designing.

The blog ClickClackGorilla.com is her baby, and yup, run from this very tiny house on wheels. What I love most about her place is that not only was the shell/home FREE, but the interior has been outfitted with free, found, and scrounged, items- and it all works so well!Nicolette's wagon was shown in the color photo section of my book \"Humble Homes, Simple Shacks\", and I want to showcase her work more thoroughly in my new book....And if you missed another one of my recent \"Vlog\" videos....here's one on building a funky, colorful, coffee table with free, salvaged forklift pallet wood!These two structures are both on the grounds of Bread and Puppet Theater in Glover, Vermont, which is celebrating its 50th anniversary this summer. Every summer scores of volunteers from all over the world come to the Northeast Kingdom farm that has been home to Bread and Puppet since the mid-1970's to work on productions that are staged there.. Many pitch tents but some are housed in old school buses and other structures-- including these funky campers-- situated around the 160 acre spread. Relaxshacks correspondent Jon Kalish was there in early June working on radio stories about the group when he took these pictures on a drizzly spring afternoon."},

{"title": "A recycled barn wood/fence plank ceiling in a tiny house on wheels", "date": "Monday, June 3, 2013", "text": "So call me insane, but the last two weeks or so, I've taken it upon myself to design and build a tiny, tiny cabin on wheels (or a bunk house, art studio, or whatever else it could be used for) to debut at the Yestermorrow Tiny House Festival in Warren, VT, where in two weekends, my brother (Dustin) and I will official open the first day of festivities and speakers with a 90 minute talk and demo on salvage construction- basically, \"How to save a crap load of money when building\".     Which ties into this: This planked roof was absolutely free. Yes, it might weight a little more than a plywood roof of the same size, but I think the look is ten times better in the end run, and it has a cool tale behind it. This cabin, for the time being will only be a seasonal weekender on wheels, so we won't insulate it, but should we later choose to, the joist pockets are already there. Meanwhile, we do have this character-laden ceiling to look at when we sleep. The planks: They were the storm-damaged fencing (true 1\" by 6\" spruce planks, 8' long) at a very well to-do residence one town over. I passed these blown down, fence segments for weeks until I finally located the residents mailbox, left a note asking if they might be getting rid of the wood, and blammo!- pne phone call and TWO entire trailer loads later, I'm up to my eyes in free wood! It never hurts to ask! I'll have much more on this tiny cabin soon, one I've dubbed \"The Cub\" (a name I used for another design wayyyyy back, that never saw the light of day), and might even blog in a step by step manner on this.... Above, you can see a splash of \"tester\" paint I used, a color I called \"baby puke green\". It was a $7.00 \"Oops\" can from Home Depot, but its not going to be used for this project. Also, pre-painting the rafters saved me the hassle of having to carefully \"cut in\" with a brush if I were to paint AFTER the planks were installed.  -Derek \"Deek\" Diedricksen"},

I can't wait to share with you).Anyway, while I've been planning as to how big to make this vacation camp/cabin, I decided to actually take a few 2by6's and nail out one rough end of what the \"A\" would actually look like. Now that I've seen it in the flesh, I'm contemplating going taller/larger, but we'll see....This one has a 10' wide base, and 12' sides. 16' sides might give it enough room for a tiny sleep loft, but then would require it be set in concrete into the ground, so as not to blow over in wind storms. 16' might look too tall and \"dart-like\" too- then again, that might be pretty cool/modern/funky. We'll see.... -Derek \"Deek\" DiedricksenThis is about as \"un-fancy\" as it gets, but heck, it works, and cost me less than $1.00, and barely any time at all!     Some neighbors of mine had A LOT of arbor work done, and were generous enough to let me have all the logs (which heated my home for a winter and a half), and while sorting through the pile, I came across this stump piece, which had a very broad base.So....-I flipped it over-Painted it with a tiny bit of some mistake paint I bought for almost nothing at Home Depot (exterior paint)-Was finished.Cave Man Table....me like!  If I wanted to make it taller/higher, I could EASILY add some scrap-block legs.

{"title": "EIGHT Simple Space Saving Approaches from Deek's Rustic VT Cabin", "date": "Friday, April 19, 2013", "text": "EIGHT simple space saving approaches, in one photo....This is a cabin I started building at the age of 21 (with my brother Dustin, when he was 18) deep in the woods of Vermont. Its off-grid, and was almost built entirely without power tools. You can't drive up to this cabin- you have to walk down a trail to get to it, thereby keeping it out of sight, and making its whereabouts less known (less prone to vandalism).Its also the main cabin for my \"Tiny House Summer Camp\" workshops- and I just may have another one down the road. Possibly a tiny house-slash-tree house building workshop- with camping, tiny house touring, and more. We did our first one last year and it sold out, with attendees coming from as far away as San Diego, Kansas, The Carolinas, Texas, Pennsylvania, and beyond. Anyway, I use this Bruce Bettis photo in a slide show I do for both my workshops and the ones I do for the Tumbleweed Tiny House Workshop, and while showing it recently (Austin, TX) a few questions came up on the \"built-ins\" I had designed into it- things that I've taken for granted, and almost forgotten about over the years.....So, as I look at the photo a little more myself now, here's what's going on....1. The Table (Ikea- $20 at the time, a little more now) folds down against the wall when not in use, thereby freeing up the main room of this cabin (only 10' by 10') when its not in \"dining room\" mode. I use it as a mini work table at times too. 2. The last step of my home built stairway/ladder, if you'll notice, is built out more than the others, and doubles as a seat, when the Ikea table is set up. It has worked really well in this dual capacity.3. The coffee table, made entirely from FREE cedar from a local mill (their kindling scraps), is hollow (not rocket science), and stores/hides many things within. Putting it on lockable wheels is something I've always wanted to do, in case I want it for use in another part of the room, but I just haven't gotten to it.4. The framing pockets over the windows (free from a dumpster) were built in a boxed-out fashion (almost like flower boxes) to additionally hold and store small items.5. The back wall is a self-built murphy bed, made entirely from junk/scrap wood. I rarely use it, as I prefer to sleep on the floor in the loft \"room\" above, but its there, and so hidden, I forget its even there. It drops down from the wall, and harbors a thick foam pad as a mattress, and the dart board on the front, takes the ride downward as well, and ends up on the underside of the bed.6. The ladder/staircase, or \"galley-style stairway\" as I call it, is angled enough to make climbing up into the loft easy, but steep and narrow enough so as to not waste space. It was self built from local lumber.7. Behind the stairway, in space that might otherwise be wasted, or neglected, lies a built-in bookcase. This shelving unit is where I harbor not only my books, but my lanterns, candles, and other camping supplies.8. The entry hole to the loft itself was intentionally kept small. Up above (See the video) its not a standing room area, and its only used for sleeping, so I felt that a restricted size opening wouldn't be so problematic, as weighed against my not having to sacrifice more floor, and sleep, space up above. The chairs, if I wasn't so attached to them (they were the chairs my brother and I grew up with, and ate cereal on, watched cartoons from, etc. at my grandparents cottage) could also be homemade instead, with boxed bases for storage. Just another means of hiding your stuff.HERE's a video we shot a few years back, giving you the general tour of the place, and camp.....This cabin has since been added onto. Its a grand total of about 300 square feet, and used for group camp-outs, my workshops (especially in inclement weather), and family excursions.  As the taxes keep going up on the place, I am considering renting it out for one single week each year to help me cover that. If interested, let me know- its bare bones, off grid, and way out there, but a gorgeous area of the country, with lots to see and do. kidcedar at gmail dot com.-Derek \"Deek\" DiedricksenThis cabin is shown, and talked about a bit in my book as well- especially my dealings with porcupine out there, which have been SO damaging and problematic to my lumber supplies."},

I've also noticed that every one of these articles I've come across has neglected to include any visual aids as to what, branding-wise, you should look for.So here it is, plain and simple....A PALLET LIKE THIS IS OK TO USE....granted, if its been left outside for sometime and is developing mildew and mold from its exposure to moisture, you'd still want to pass on it, but \"HT\" is a good thing. A stamped \"HT\" means that the pallet has been \"Heat Treated\" and not sprayed with, well, poisonOne stamped \"MT\" signifies that the pallet has been sprayed with Methyl Bromide.....and lets just say you don't want to lick those type pallets or build a crib for infants from them....or make garden bins for your edibles out of them either (something I see ALL the time, and out of pressure-treated wood too- a no, no).As you can see, the stamping differs on many pallets you'll find, but the \"HT\" or \"MT\" will be there most of the time....Also keep in mind that as pallets weather or age, their branding fades. In those cases, if you're worried, or hesitant, its better to play it safe and pass them up (esp. if the destined project is an INDOOR piece of furniture) . Above: A nice clean pallet, in good shape, and marked \"MT\", that is ready to be re-purposed.  -Derek \"Deek\" Diedricksen"},

We're just around the 3000 mark already! www.facebook.com/tinyhousehub  Its not finished, but I'm getting there... Here's a little update on what we built at my Relaxshacks.com Tiny House Building Workshop last November in Massachusetts....a tiny, tiny cabin/house on a trailer/wheels. The interior isn't done, but I'll post more photos as things progress....and yes, we'll probably have another backyard/campout weekend- tba.    Spring is finally in full effect here in New England and I've really been getting a lot done, by way of carpentry, outdoors again (Lovin' it!)- singlehandedly moving this trailer house up a slight incline, and without a vehicle was one of those tasks. I only moved it about 25 feet or so, but it took a bit of time and patience- all with a simple $30 \"come-along\" (winch) from Harbor Freight. It worked well. Ever wonder how someone backs the hitch end of a trailer/travel trailer against a wall, or into a tight spot where a vehicle would otherwise end up stuck? Well, that's one of the ways.....Today, I'm putting the ridge cap on, among other things.... The house in the background is built into a hill, and not as huge as it looks- its around 1000 square feet for a family or four. What you see is the downhill side of part of the basement. This little house, for those who haven't yet seen the video (also below) is a mere 5.5' wide, 8' long, and a little over 11' tall. While its on a trailer, it really isn't intended for road travel, but was built on wheels to utilize a building code loophole- \"its a moveable, non-permanent structure\". When finished, it will have a tiny loft, and perhaps even a tiny little bathroom- a little fold down table area and shelves for food cooking and prep as well.RECYCLED MATERIAL: The door was bought second-hand- very inexpensively, and ALL the windows were FREE- found on the side of the road. The trailer was bought used as well- $300. The metal roofing- leftovers I purchased from a woman on craigslist- a HUGE load for $200 (probably sixteen 9-10' heavy gauge, galvanized sheets)- I have used these for other projects, and still have some left over. Total cost on this project is probably somewhere in the ballpark of $2000.00 Oh yeah, the entire deck was not only FREE, but I made money on it in a way.....my old boss hired me to take his deck down and apart for $200- and let me keep EVERYTHING. The deck was only 10 years old. I've used this wood for many projects as well. The deck also serves as a nice work surface, and level building platform during our workshops.-Derek \"Deek\" Diedricksen My Book- on Tiny Shelter Designs/DIY/Recycled material building..."},

{"title": "Recycled Junk Project: A Forklift Pallet SUPER-FORT! ", "date": "Saturday, April 6, 2013", "text": "Here's a few shots of an \"Almost finished\" playhouse/fort/clubhouse that I built our of SCRAPS and CRAP wood (lots of cast off pieces from a mill and FREE pallet wood) for my kids. The swing set/playground itself was FREE as well. I drove to a woman's house, after seeing her craigslist ad, and took the entire set apart and loaded it into my 4' by 8' trailer- a savings of over $1500.00. Later, after bringing it home, I re-set it up in about three hours, then stained it with a new coat of \"cedar red\".To anyone considering getting a small utility trailer, DO IT- it'll pay for itself ten times over in the first year or two alone!    And yes, back on the cabin/fort/playhouse my neighbors are very supportive/tolerant of my endeavors- in fact, they often donate many supplies and items they've found, or are getting rid of, towards my builds. One neighbor always makes it a point to help and attend all the backyard workshops I hold as well, and even lets attendees camp in his lot- I'm lucky to share lot lines with such good, and laid back, people....As simple as this is, building it was somewhat of a challenge, as I had to deal with limited lengths of wood, and wood that was, well, trash by most \"normal standards\"- pallet wood (heat treated- its safe), and mill extras (pseudo log siding) composed most of the materials. The strapping/trim (a cheap alternative even if bought brand new) was all from a pile of project leftovers I had saved too.  -Derek \"Deek\" DiedricksenTons of Recycled Material Building Ideas are in my book \"Humble Homes, Simple Shacks\"- and I also recommend these other books too- esp. if you have young kids and want to get some project ideas."},

This little backyard cottage was built and decorated by Stjepan and Robin Boban. Stjepan is a carpenter by trade and used a wealth of discarded cedar fence boards and barn wood to not only clad the outside of his little cabin, but the INSIDE ceiling as well, which lends it a lot of character tp this cozy place! Laying in bed, you can look upward to see a wild variety of wood grains and patterns, knot holes, and even an occasional rusty nail head or two- much more interesting than a single-color drywall ceiling. Discarded, and now-rescued, single-pane windows have now become wall hangings/decorations....This tiny cottage makes use of the main house's bathroom (but will soon have its own). The 10' by 14' cabin also feels much larger with the employment of the ole \"mirrored wall\" trick.

Nuthin' more....This is not a \"tiny house\" or home in the traditional sense, but it could make for a really cool (in the shade of a tree) seasonal vacation cabin (with some curtains preferably), and as with most tiny sheds, follies, and backyard studios, a bathroom and micro-kitchen, or food prep area, could easily be installed.Spray Architecture designed and built this particular cabin in 2012.

The legs were almost $20, but I loved the look so much that I decided to take the hit- you could easily add cheaper, or free, wooden legs, of course.  What I love about the top of the table (which comes off to reveal a large storage area) is that it could also potentially be hung as an art piece as well. I'm going to eventually sell this after I use it in a shoot for a cabin I'm building (for my \"Tiny Yellow House\" youtube show).  -"},

I LOVE the large bay of windows in the front- its what attracted me to this cabin in the first place- heck, stick it on the ground, and it'd make for a great looking tiny house/micro home as well! Here's what Judy had to say....     My tree house was built on a whim.  I had grown up wanting three things: a swimming pool, a convertible and a tree house.  The first two were easy enough, but a tree house seemed impractical and unduly whimsical, so I put that on the back burner.     One day, when I was talking to some friends in Glacier, WA. and mentioned wanting a tree house for my grandchildren (I was 65 by this time), someone told me of a local kid who had built a tree house out of recycled materials and was currently living in it.  Ben turned out to be a young fellow who lived close to the land, and didn't even own a car or telephone, but I eventually located him and started plans to make a modest little play house.  He teamed up with another local woodsman, Casey Coe, who had a truck and the proper tools, and they began what turned out to be a rather extravagant project, more of a temple for me than a play space for the kids!     I use my tree house as a place to meet privately with friends, to display local art, to offer overnight lodging for snowboarders, to pray and just to observe Glacier Creek, which flows below, and watch the deer, the eagles (and once a bear)!.      Over 300 people have come to see my tree house and signed my guest book, including the main builder from Pete Nelson's tree house workshop in Seattle, who gave his stamp of approval and took some notes to share with his team. This is one of the tree houses (alongside cabins, tiny houses, kid's forts, yurts, and more) that I plan to feature in my next book- a VERY DIFFERENT follow-up to my book \"Humble Homes, Simple Shacks\".

The design is inspired in a few ways, by the work of Lester Walker, and Jeff Milstein, if I had to pick two names in the tiny house and design field. Bear on a framed Birch Ply panel- high quality! by Keemo Thankfully, here in New England the snow is finally going away and its getting a little warmer so that I can get some work done, so soonish, you'll be seeing and reading more about these projects. Anyway, in particular, I've REALLY been loving the artwork and paintings from this guy who goes by \"Keemo\"- his art is wildly fun and colorful, and damn reasonable too....He's a cottage industry, diy guy, with a family to feed, so give him a look, or some support- www.KeemoGallery.com I bought four REALLY cool pieces off him recently.....(the bear above is one of 'em)Lantern above: This I found at a Barn/Weekend Flea Market in Douglas, MA- such a nice little New England town, and the flea market owners were VERY NICE!- all based in a GREAT looking, vaulted roof barn too- I'll be back!

Anyway, here are quiet a few photos of his little cabin for writing, relaxing, vacation, or perhaps full time living....its seems a pretty versatile tiny house/shed/studio design.....he currently has two of these models on display in his shop yard in Jamaica, Vermont, which are open to visiting.This cabin, alongside many new designs of my own, is one I plan to feature in the tiny housing book I'm now working on- a follow-up to \"Humble Homes, Simple Shacks\".

This was intended for developing countries to help break the cycle of poverty, by freeing up time, creating potential jobs (paid laundry service would become possible when it no longer takes upwards of 6 hours per load the old way), and was crafted to be ergonomically efficient. As you can see below, once loaded with soap and water, the user can sit atop the washer (with a padded top), and operate the foot pedal in a less labor-intensive manner. As a drummer, \"bass drum pedal\" immediately comes to mind- something I use/depress literally thousands of times each night I gig with my band DEFDEALER, so I know first hand, that this wouldn't be too tough to operate....and just maybe I could work on my rhythmic skills at the same time!

One \"tree house\", or more so a pole structure, that I felt was the best of the bunch was a cube-like, 8' by 8', lofted hut that was designed by Joseph Cho and Stephanie Lew.  A structure like this, as you'll see in the the video excerpt, could be used, or morphed into a great little vacation, or getaway cabin, especially as one that would be versatile on less savory land and terrain- after all, once its four poles are set, you're good to go. On a hill, or in flood prone or swampy areas, you would have no problem with a simple cabin like this. This pole house, apparently, was inspired by Japanese-style lanterns, and while I wasn't there to witness it lit up at night from within, I'm sure its spectacular.

By affordable, I mean not only to purchase, but to construct. When built with new materials, this cabin would cost around $1200.00 (maybe less), and easily serve as a vacation cabin for two. I've long had rough plans and ideas for a micro A-frame cabin that is EASY and quick to build, and now, this pairing with David Stiles will not only make these plans fun, but legible, more organized, and easy to comprehend. His artistic style is great, and those of you who haven't checked out D n' J's work, you're truly missing out. Check out the link below....Oh yeah, the A-frame will also expand, or transform, but more on that later....Before I ramble further, WE'RE LOOKING FOR YOUR INPUT, as David and I keep batting \"size\" ideas back and forth.Which shape do you like best?

(Book Giveaway #2)", "date": "Tuesday, February 26, 2013", "text": "Rafter storage from Core77.com   Heck, small home or not, people are ALWAYS looking for ways to maximize their storage. Of course, not having so much stuff to start with would be ideal, but many of us know that this is easier said than done.     I myself grew up in a fairly modest sized home (1400 square feet with four of us and a menagerie of pets), so a few of these tips come from that household. The rest of the tips are ones I've since developed, use myself, or come from my tiny house/shelter concept book \"Humble Homes, Simple Shacks\". BOOK GIVEAWAY #2 (of TWELVE!!) JOIN OUR NEW FACEBOOK PAGE TO WIN TODAY'S BOOK- Lloyd Kahn's \"Tiny Homes, Simple Shelter\"- www.facebook.com/tinyhousehub .... Just enter YOUR inventive storage tip in the appropriate thread, and the best one will win Lloyd's book. US only- sorry....TEN STORAGE SPACES YOU DIDN'T REALIZE YOU HAD....1. \"HIGH END\" SHELVING: My father did this in my old bedroom, and I've done it in my kids bedroom....no, not \"high end\" in price, but in vertical stature. Space near ceilings is usually not occupied or utilized, and when shelves are installed so high up, they provide storage while also remaining out of your normal line of sight. The result is additional storage and shelving, but a means that doesn't make for a cluttered look. There video I shot below, shows an example of this....2. DEAD SPACE BEHIND DOORS: This one is pretty self-explanatory, but here's another area of the home where you usually won't find much going on. Its another mostly hidden space, and one where you could hang coats, or build yourself some super-simple, thin, shelving- for toys, and other small items. This could work well in bathrooms as well, for the storage of smaller toiletry items. This is covered in the above video as well. 3. HOLLOW STEP STORAGE: For all your owners of tiny houses on wheels, Tumbleweed-style homes, and/or unique travel trailers, I always see people taking the time to build a nice portable box step or two to their front door, but why not make the box watertight and with a removable top? I wouldn't store anything of great value in here, but its making use of space you already would have been taking up, and doing nothing with. Your front step would now become a low, flat, all-weather, storage trunk of sorts.This one's from deckanddockboxes.com, but you can build your own!4. BOX FRAME BEDDING: My brother has a set-up like this in his home, and growing up, my bed had a box frame built atop it, raising my bed a 2by8 in height, but well worth it for the gained storage. Not only could I store things UNDER my bed, but when I lifted my mattress, and the plywood cover beneath, I had a place to store all my baseball cards, comic books, and such. You're basically building an intermediate hollow deck that sits atop your existing bed frame.5. YOUR OVEN: We always got quite a variety of comments on this one, and the key is to never pre-heat your oven before removing stored goods from it. In my childhood home, cereal was always stored inside our oven. Cereal boxes do take up quite a bit or space, especially when you're a family that lives off the stuff! Currently in my own home, our family stores pots, pans, and baking sheets in the oven. With these items, even if you forget to remove them before pre-heating, nothing will catch fire.6. UNDER YOUR TINY HOME: This one comes off as very unprofound, but I'm always amazed at how many wheeled tiny house owners don't simply invest in a simple Rubbermaid bin that they can then stash under their home. Again, I wouldn't put anything extremely valuable in here, but its another means to acquire space that otherwise is only being occupied by spiders. For added security, you could build a \"skirt\" around your cabin, hiding its wheeled look, adding the benefit of some heat retention/additional insulation, and making this storage spot even more secure (and unseen).7. YOUR RAFTERS: Have exposed rafter work in your home? Well, in a less seen area, take one empty \"cell\", or section, and devise/build a hinged box that swings up into this spaces and clips into place. As seen in many basements, you could also simply affix a wide board to the underside of the joist, and thereby create some thin shelving this way.8. FLOORAGE: This one is a little less conventional, but its worked well for me and falls under the \"Out Of Sight, Out Of Mind\" banner. In my micro closet-office, I built a false floor (in an area I couldn't stand up in anyway) that serves as a sitting spot for my kids for playing and reading, but....lift the top, or \"floor\" up, and there's a ton of storage within. The one I have was built with 2by6's and stores more than you'd imagine.  And then in \"OPEN\" mode 9. JAR IT!: Under your kitchen cabinets and shelving, and I'm talking the \"hanging\" space beneath, lies room for the \"ole time\" practice of \"hung jar storage\". You can buy the fancy magnetic sets from Ikea and elsewhere, or you can simply take a mason jar or baby food jar, attach the lid under a shelf with a single screw, and then thread it into place once filled with whatever you've chosen. This works well in an office setting too, and these little jars are great for holding tacks, and other small odds and ends. 10. JUST LOOK UP! Your kitchen ceiling is another spot, by means of a pot rack, where many items can be stowed. There are a variety of homemade pot racks, using driftwood, pallet wood, and beyond, that i've seen. Better yet, make the platform from which the hooks hang solid, and you not only have a means to hang your cooking wear, but a floating shelf above where you can store additional goods, baskets, pans, and whatever else you can dream up. from agreenpointkitchen.com-Derek \"Deek\" Diedricksen"},

{"title": "Vintage Oil and Kerosene Heaters/Heat for Your Tiny Home? ", "date": "Wednesday, February 20, 2013", "text": "A \"Perfection\" Vintage Space Heater (Kerosene or Oil) that I paid $68 for.   I found this beauty of a heater (the one above) at an antiques barn in Winslow, Maine last year, and it was in perfect shape, wick and all. It was only recently that I had a chance to try it out, and man is it a good looking little heater- almost as ART/decor and heat in one. I actually have another vintage Sears knock-off heater I got at a Vermont yard sale (that I'm actually selling for $50 or so.. kidcedar at gmail.com), and I've found a GREAT source for wicks and parts, which I talk about below..... ---------------------------      Now most people hear the word \"Kerosene\" and they freak out- visions of carbon monoxide victims dance in their heads, the smells associated with burning this fuel, and the burdens of finding it in many states....BUT, it is another possible option for heating your home, or tiny home, but read on- PLEASE......Plus, there isn't just one type of kerosene, and its not all so \"stinky\", but more on that later on....Kerosene has been used for ages in heating, and if used properly, and adequate ventilation is present, it doesn't pose a problem. Now with tiny houses, the need for ventilation increases because of the small area of cubic feet, or the volume, in the dwelling you're dealing with. That's not to say it won't work, but a cracked window, and a carbon monoxide detector are a MUST! I feel even having a second, back-up alarm is a good idea- they're inexpensive anyway. Do not neglect, mess around, or cheap out with these detectors- without them, you could DIE. This goes for propane heaters, and so forth, as well. NOTE: And I emphasize this at all the workshops I teach....with ANY type of combustion heat, you will need a CO Detector, and when hanging them, hang them LOW near the ground, and NOT high up as you would a smoke detector- they are two different animals. Carbon Monoxide, is HEAVIER than air, so by the time it registers at a detector near your ceiling, you're already dead. The phrase I use is this (with incorrect ceiling installations): \"When its ringin, you're already singin'.....with the angels\". Don't mess this up.But back on these heaters themselves.....Basically, as they're affordable, and crank out a ton of heat, kerosene heaters (which also run on lamp oil, and low sulfur diesel, but usually K1, water clear kerosene) are something to at least consider, especially since the mechanics of them are SO INCREDIBLY SIMPLE- meaning, there's less that will break down, and its easier to repair them should something happen.If you happen to come across one of these beautiful vintage heaters, the parts and wicks are a little harder to come by for some models, but I found a GREAT site that carries just about anything you'll need. I'm not getting compensated to plug this guy, he has just been top notch in his service, answered all my email questions, and well, he runs a cottage industry business, so I have to give him a nod.MILESSTAIR.com is the guy- and he has a dizzying array of parts and wicks you can buy online. Yes, there are many parts of the world, and in the US, where people still use oil lamps and oil/kero heaters for light and heat- especially in the \"back to the land\" movement. If you're building a tiny house or any old home off grid, or need emergency lighting in power outages, its never a bad idea to have these items on hand.Lanterns: My cabin in Vermont, when not using Coleman white gas lanterns (which I LOVE, and have lasted me fifteen years or more now), I use oil lamps, and I LOVE the look of them. You can even buy cheap models at Sprawlmart- for as little as $6.00 or so.If you want good lanterns (which also give off a good amount of heat, and DO require some ventilation too), DIETZ is a long standing brand that I really trust. GOOD vintage Dietz lanterns fetch quite a bit or money on ebay too, so if you come across any of these at yard sales, pick 'em up! Especially the old railroad yard ones, or the red domed/glass ones. Anyway, I'm by no means pushing kero and oil heat here, I'm just merely adding it to the realm of possibilities for heating, whether it be for permanent, temporary (for work space use), or emergency heat. There are quite a few people out there who use these vintage heaters for their homes. I'm not saying it would necessarily be my first choice, but it is choice among many.FUEL TYPES/BREAKDOWNS......All work with the heater I have....and here's the divisions, as I understand them (feel free to further look them up or correct me). LAMP OIL/Liquid Parrafin- The highest grade of these fuels, and usually most expensive, it burns the cleanest (with the least amount of smell/odor). You'll see this coming in several colors, sometimes in scented versions, and with a citronella additive sometimes (use that stuff (citronella) outside). K1 Kerosene- The highest grade of kerosene- more expensive than K2, and a little harder to find (depending on your state/laws), but it burns with much less of a scent. Kerosene (No. 2)- \"The Red Stuff\" -Standard heating grade, but it burns with an odor, more-so when first used/lit. Its more prone to clog up the wicks over time too, which should be monitored if you're going to go this route. Low Sulfur Diesel- a little lower in grade and \"stinkier\", but it works as well.Nitroglycerine- gives you the \"most light\", although very short lived. Kidding....kidding....-------------------Also, here's a great informational excerpt from www.LampGuild.com, a great site on these heaters, and on lanterns.... The fuel for use        in these heaters is \"1K kerosene\". Be certain you obtain true        water clear kerosene as this reduces the odor associated with        burning. DO NOT use either the red-dyed kerosene or home        heating oil. The first will clog the wick, the second will        drive you from your home due to the stench. A relatively        expensive alternative is a product called ClearLite, a low odor        fuel UL certified for use in kerosene heaters. As with all        indoor combustion, adequate ventilation is important for        safety. Clean your vintage heater and font thoroughly before you fire it        up for the first time and use a fresh wick. With these steps        your heater should function quite well and, despite its age,        provide an enjoyable source of warmth and charm to your home.-Derek \"Deek\" Diedricksen"},

Have no fear, \"Super Thrifty Rustic Man\" is here! No, I'm not cheap, I actually blow lots of money on eating out, travel, and many stupid things (bedazzled shoe horns, remote control whoopee cushions, snuggies), but I do LOVE creating things....even when its something as simple as THIS FIX....which is a great project with young kids too, as its so incredibly easy, and teaches them the value of recycling and, well, not being a lazy tub of goo. RUSTIC STORM WOOD SHELF SUPPORTSTo do this properly, you want to have a stock of \"squaw wood\" (wrist thick, or so, limbs) that have been previously selected, and stored/dryed. Better yet, if they're stored indoors, they've already acclimated to the climate of your home in terms of expansion and contraction. It shouldn't matter TOO much if you don't do this ahead of time, but you run the risk of the wood expanding, or shrinking, by as much as 1/4\" afterwards if you don't. That's up to you, especially if you're building something that needs to be \"K.T.T\" as I call it- \"Kitchen Cabinet Tight\". Also, drying and storing the wood gives it a chance to shed itself of the boring insects that already might be inherent in the wood when it was living.Note: These branches are among many I saved and shaved/skinned from a large limb that fell in a storm about two years ago. I keep using these things for a variety of projects...BIRCH WORKS and LOOKS great too, but from a blight, we don't have many of them around here, so I usually spare those that I could have harvested. ---------------------------Step 1: Carefully measure the lengths you need, and make 'em a hair longer....you want these to tightly fit into place so that they could almost be left in place on a gravity/pressure-fitting alone.Step 2: I gave them a quick coat of Minwax Polyurethane- if there are any bugs within, this might kill them, or at least won't make them so happy. If stored/dryed properly, there should not be any powder post beetles, or anything in these though....be sure to look them over before using them. I've done this so many times and have never had a problem. Step 3: Jam 'em into place and secure them with a mere brad from above, and a toe-nailed brad from below. Again, a tight fit should do most of the work for you, even without this tiny nail. You can use a dab of construction adhesive too, if you'd like. Step 4: Never have to worry about your sagging shelf again. Commence reading and hoarding books.....This tip is pretty unprofound, but I have many, many, many like it (but a bit more inventive/funky) in my book \"Humble Homes, Simple Shacks\"....if you might be lookin' for more! -Derek \"Deek\" Diedricksen"},

As you start to hollow out the area underneath, toss the snow you've scooped on top to weigh and anchor the plywood down and to eventually hide it.

It won't be quite \"Humble Homes, Simple Shacks\" Part TWO, but WILL have some new art sketches and out-there shelter concepts, I promise. Anyway, I'm getting this blog post up before we lose power, as the lights keep flickering and the Boston area is getting NAILED with this snow storm.

No, we didn't scoop up any yellow snow....The wood stove is roaring, I've got beer, candles, and everything else I could possibly need.... Back on track, I contacted the Swedish artist/designer of this cool architectural installation, Helle Kvamme, and here's what she had to say...----------Hi Derek, Here's a little background on that structure....Steam studio is a project I did in 2007 as a part of an international art exchange by SKART / Ireland. The project was called PLUS/MINUS therefore the steam that would change the temperature in the studio from minus to plus degrees. This became a source of fantastic experimentation. While working in the studio I had to fire up a wooden stove to steam water. The steam went up through a pipe in the floor and changed the dry cold air to moist warm air. It was possible for me to work there for some time but the steam made fog on the glass and then the place became more private and I was simply a shadow in the space and at night. When I stopped firing, the place got cold again and the window became icy on the inside and therefore distorted the image of the room.I use recycled materials if possible / too much stuff in this world. The steam studio is built from to large windows that a neighbor gave to me. One of the reasons for me making this studio was the longing to work in a place enclosed by nature and to make my concentration be concerned with my surroundings. I wanted to force my eye to look at this everything in detail.You can find out more, and see other photos of my work at www.hellekvamme.seKind Regards HelleFor those of you into far-our micro-structures, camps, cabins, and tiny houses....check out my book, AND I had a recent post on THE BEST TINY HOUSE BOOKS OUT THERE....which I shot a vlog video for....Here's that video again (where I'm massively sleep deprived! lol- I look like a zombie!)....and the book link tis' below...In this video, I feature and review ten or so tiny house/diy books that I feel are exceptional....I created this video the other day in response to the many emails I've received asking what books I recommend in the tiny house/micro-architecture field....well.....here you go!

Heck yes.There are probably, literally, about a thousand variations of things and projects that pallets and pallet wood can be used for, and we've covered the subject MANY times here on Relaxshacks.com, but here are a few more, very creative uses I've found. These photos have been emailed in by readers over the last year or so (thank you!) and I feel they are exceptional examples of creativity.When it comes to home building and interior decoration, some of these ideas could very well save you quite a bit of money, so if you see something you like, file it away in the back of your mind for later. Utility Shelves- Its just the ends chopped of a pallet, and the \"end-end\" capped (to form the bottom of the shelf. This is as simple as it gets. Sand them down, and paint them to work with a room, if need be.  This would look GREAT in a shipping container home, although its an IMMENSE amount of work to do this. The blue boards accent things nicely, and you can always pre-stain some pallets before you install them if you want to go for a certain calico or colorful look.  Here's a garden tool storage unit made from a pallet- you don't even have to alter or cut it at all!  Another pallet, untouched, and simple mounted on the wall.... A forklift pallet tree house- since pallet wood usually comes in lengths around 4', you have to be creative, and patient, with a project like this.  More simplicity. This would work very well in a loft style/industrial apartment, or in an art gallery or store- the price is right too!  This idea is not only affordable, but artsy n' classy in its own way. It would work well in a kids room too!-Derek \"Deek\" Diedricksen"},

Its such a cool little cabin/shelterpod (that could make for a great, modern, tiny home), and its destroyed so quickly by lava flow from a volcano. As they say, \"Location Is Everything\".The write-up from the video:This shelterpod was owned, designed and built by Mr. Paddy Daly who lives in Bellyacres Eco-village adjacent to Seaview Estates. Paddy was welcomed in to Bellyacres as family would be when the lava flows inundated the area in early 2008 and made it impractical (and illegal) for him to continue living in his private property.The shelterpod was built on lava flows from the 80's or early 90's about 1000 feet from the coast. It was a unique design consisting of a small living pod resting on a large deck. It had an electrical system consisting of a solar panel, storage battery and an inverter to supply 120 volt AC current. Two large plastic tanks sat under the deck and were to be supplied with rain water from the roof through the gutters and downspouts which were in the process of being installed. Spectacular views from the deck and large windows could be seen in all directions.Paddy was not only generous enough to allow visitors to rest in his pod while it was standing tall but also generous to share its dramatic end with the public. His generosity will continue into the future as he plans to leave Bellyacres in June, 2010, and begin a two year Peace Corps agricultural tour in sub Saharan Africa.Good luck and  mahalo to Paddy.Recorded November 3, 2009----------------------- And for those who missed our OFFICIAL EVENT POSTER....er....\"posting\"- here you go again!

I can't find a credit for this one, so I'll just take the liberty of dubbing it \"The Soil Yourself House\". Those afraid of heights need not apply! I LOVE this place- its incredibly daring.  Photo: The downside....carrying in building materials, and supplies would be a nightmare. The bright side: what a view this place would have! -and vandals might be less likely to strike for fear of falling to their demise!------------------------------Other potential approaches and solutions for less-savory terrain include....-Stilt-houses for marsh territories (A pole house approach, but using treated timbers, or concrete pilings). -Floating homes- Can't afford land? Build a houseboat, OR, build a houseboat to sit atop a flood plain piece of land. This way you're not disturbing wetlands by most laws/regions, and if you land ever floods, Noah's Ark-style, you need not worry.-Cantilevered homes (and/or on poles)- I've seen this done (even \"bridge-style\")) with a good many shipping container homes.-Buying in less populated/desert areas- New Mexico, for example (I own a piece of land in NM (1/2 acre) that I bought about ten years ago for a mere $500.00). Sure, its in the middle of a nuclear testing site, but it was cheap! No, its perfectly safe, and even very picturesque. You might not be near a major metropolitan area with this approach (which you may prefer), or much of anything, but its one means to an end. My Vermont land, I bought it when I was 21/22 for $11,500 (cash- I had saved awhile)- a 10.5 acre plot. Phil Garlington's book \"Rancho Costa Nada\" might appeal to those looking to head to ultra-affordable scrub-lands as their path of action. -Hillside Dugout Homes- Self explanatory, and see Mike Oehler's brilliant \"The $50 and Up Underground House Book\" for more on this (below).-Tree Houses- If the trees are large enough and well rooted enough, why not?? If you're out of sight too, in a rural region, what building inspector is going to find, or find, then climb, to your plot to heckle you? Hilly lands can also make tree house access EASIER, if you chose, as you can simply build a walkway from the rising land behind the structure, to enter it without having to climb a ladder, or stairs, at all- and think of the view you might have! The now viral/famous \"Hemloft\" tree house uses this approach.A hillside tree house from the German firm Bauhaus -TIER Your Structure to conform to the land. Look at the many terraced villages in Italy, and elsewhere, its worked well for them, even in a farming sense, so why not?-Building into/onto boulders! If the terrain is too rocky, build atop and amongst the rocks, with a carbide drill bit, a collar, and some cement, you can affix footings to giant rocks rather easily, and most of these monoliths, structure-wise, won't be moving anytime soon."},

VERY clever, and I came across it in the new book \"PLY DESIGN\"- by Phillip Schmidt. This hefty, well laid out book, features \"73 Distinctive DIY Projects In Plywood\". I just picked it up yesterday and have been leafing through it quite a bit- there's definitely some great, fun, and modern, inspiration within (not to mention affordable!).Lester Walker (Architect and Tiny House Designing Pioneer) coined the term \"Turniture\" (Furniture that transforms from one thing/use into another), decades back, and this little desk would certainly apply.  This one was designed/contributed by Dieter AmickWhen flipped downward, the chair's back becomes a tiny desk, with a drawer for storage, and a chalk-board surface. The book is 320 pages, full color, and has some very thorough plans- if plywood n' funky furniture is your thing, I'd give it a whirl.Here's a link...."},

Love it!  This one made my day, and was featured over on TinyHouseSwoon.com. Mimi Day, who owns it, said that the inspiration/base for the design was my \"Gypsy Junker\" mini shelter from my book \"Humble Homes, Simple Shacks\". I love what her and her carpenter came up with! Its been dubbed \"Henrietta\" and was built atop a large utility cart purchased from Northern Tools (with a tiny hitch so it can be moved with a small lawn tractor, or by two people). Its 7' tall, and the floor is 4' by 5' 8\", long enough for her to sleep in. It also features a writing desk for her artwork and crafts. GYPSY JUNKER IS FOR SALE....By the way, and I'll have more details soon, but my tiny office/sleeper/shelter \"The Gypsy Junker\" a micro camp house that was featured in The NY Times, and beyond- is for sale- $1200.00. I'll eventually have more posted on the site tinyhouselistings.com. The proceeds will go into another two tiny shelter/house projects I'm gunning towards, and also help finish my micro shantyboat/houseboat and its related video.

Basically, its a hub for recommended tiny house building, space saving, heating, and otherwise related gear. There's certainly some really cool stuff in there, and like his tinyhouselistings site, you'll find yourself spending more time than you planned, perusing its contents.Here's what you'll see if you click over at the link HERE.... and three extra of my recommendations are below (and why)....As for a few items I'd also include....just from my personal use and experience....(links for these are below)- I talk about these and use them at my workshops (among others)- April 26th-28th in Wilmington, NC is our next one! 3 Days Long! 1. Victorinox \"Swiss Card\" -It doesn't get any tinier when it comes to this one from Victorinox- YES, they're the makers of Swiss Army Knives- also immensely useful at home for odds, ends, and fixes, AND on the building/job site. This little credit card-like version, designed to fit in your wallet, is loaded with micro-tools. Naturally, its GREAT for tiny house dwellers as it doesn't take up much space at all! I love the look of 'em too- some great designing!2. Ikea Micro Solar Lamp- Note: IF you live near an Ikea, when these are \"in season\", they're much cheaper than the link listed here. Also, for each one purchased, Ikea sends a second lamp to a needy school child in a third world country. This lamp comes in many colors, its pretty sleek looking, and pretty bright (l.e.d. bulbs). We've used it while camping to check the kids hair at night for ticks, for reading, and as a makeshift flashlight. You could also mount it on a wall that gets sunlight by day, and use it as a push button house light at night. I might do a video review on this down the road even.....3. \"Sheds\"- well, aside from my own (\"Humble Homes, Simple Shacks\")- one out-of-print book that I think is GREAT for beginning carpenters is \"Sheds\", from the Creative Homeowners series. Its simple, well illustrated, and parallels so much of what you need to build a tiny house. 'Nuff said. The David and Jeanie Stiles Book/Version is also FANTASTIC- and cheaper actually- STILL IN PRINT TOO. 4. Angle Finder Tool- GREAT for finding rafter, and trim-work angles for your cuts. It eliminates the guess work, and its compact.5. Stanley Fat Max Saw- Still one of my favorites, its not too expensive, and cuts VERY well.And there are just a few recommendations, for what its worth...."},

{"title": "SAVE a FEW HUNDRED DOLLARS while building your tiny house....", "date": "Wednesday, January 2, 2013", "text": "This is a topic I'll be talking about at my Wilmington, NC Tiny House-Building Workshop on April 26th- 28th- HOW TO SAVE THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS while building your tiny house, cabin, or travel trailer. We'll put some of these tips into action as we build a tiny guest house as well! There are a TON of tips I talk about, but let me drop one simple one on you by means of a question. First though, I want you to look at this photo....Now ask yourself, \"Did I notice that the floors are mere plywood?\". Looks pretty darn decent doesn't it.     By using plywood, and skipping a second layer of flooring (where applicable), you eliminate one step of work in the path towards your tiny house, the large chunk of time required to lay a tongue and groove floor is done away with (and the need for specialty tools), AND you're only buying plywood for the task.     Now granted, you're going to have to buy better grade plywood than what you might have otherwise hid under a layer of fancy flooring, but you're saving a large wad of cash, time, and with a simple swabbin' of polyurethane, or some other protectant, these floors still look great! If you're worried about seeing seams, keep in mind that area rugs and furniture may be taking up half of the floor, visually, anyway. I also love that the walls you see in this photo are structural, but with the addition of thick blocking, also become storage shelves- an age old trick. Coming up, I'll also have alternate flooring techniques- ALSO money saving! A decent portion of these ideas are in the book \"Humble Homes, Simple Shacks\", but I've come up with a few new ones since that book was printed. -Derek \"Deek\" Diedricksen"},

Hi Derek,Here are some more photos I thought you could share. We are getting close to having the cabin finished. We need to work on the steps and railings.So we began the house over 5 years ago. We wanted a cabin in our woods so we would not have to dive up north and spend the weekends taking care of a second home. So the cabin is in the back woods about 300 yards from the house. We have power, no sewer. Electric base board heat. I hope to get a propane stove eventually.The first year we got the post and beam \"foundation\" and the basic structure of the building, including the windows and the 5th and 6 photos. Then I cedar shaked it. Then the ceilings went in - painted boards that we recycled from a 100 year old building . (we planed them, tongued and grooved) photo 7. Photo 8 is putting up the knotty pine. It's been a slow project, but we are getting close. I don't think that David wants to finish the sleeping loft with the railing so he can go out and sleep there without me. I can't sleep in the loft without a railing - too scared of falling.   -AndreaHere's the book the cabin is shown in...alongside a TON of hand sketched tiny house and shelter concepts, other photos, and building and design info from the likes of Lloyd Kahn, Jay Shafer, Mimi Zeiger, Duo Dickinson, David and Jeanie Stiles, Colin Beaven, Alex Pino, Kent Griswold, Dee Williams, and many more...."},

Most of the book is geared towards kid-like forts, but almost ALL the info and diagrams can be sensibly applied towards larger \"adult\" builds. There are some great, easy to understand, techniques within.

Note the very simple stairs, the roof hatch, and beneath the cabin, what I imagine to be a storage bin, accessed through a floor hatch within the hut. I've looked for more info on this little shelter time and time again, but never can find much- just that its in the Berkshires in MA (and debatable, from sources, at that), part of a monastery retreat that used to feature/house a few dwellers and tree houses, and that as of more recently, only one man was left at the compound, and he only used this place occasionally. Man, I'd love to visit.WHAT I WOULDN'T DO (as I've built a half dozen tree houses or so): It looks like the support girders are merely 2 by 4's, probably not treated ones too (although you can get away with that in some cases/applications). I see that they've backed up each attaching point with a 2 by 4 scrap beneath it (a good idea)- but again, I'd use something heftier, and would use carriage screws or bolts, not mere nails (they're bound to eventually pull from their anchored positions). Two of the trees they've built off look about only 4\" or so in diameter too- which I'd stray from, if possible- although, they are two of four trees holding this place up, so in that case, its probably fine, and perhaps we're dealing with a very petite monk here. If possible, I personally TRY to only use trees that are 10\" in diameter, but in some cases you're forced to work with what you're given.    -Derek \"Deek\" Diedricksen"},

Well, NO ONE I knew had the book \"The $50 and Up Underground House\" by Mike \"The Moleman\" Oehler, and it being priced at $20 or so made me hesitate to pick it up a few times in the past.Well, ladies and gents, I was an IDIOT not to, and in terms of being just out there(!), while making perfect sense, and being loaded with some GREAT building information, not to mention illustrations and photos that make Oehler's approach very clear, I ordered, devoured, and LOVED this book.Again, its a bizarre book, and Oehler loves a good occasional rant, but, the information is great and after reading this book, I'm pretty damn inspired to go on and try building an underground dwelling at some point. I actually have always wanted to do this, but this book has given me a good, needed, kick in the pants.To sum it up, if you're fascinated by underground dwellings, do check this one out. OTHER INSANE Tiny House and DIY/Thrift Living BOOKS I LOVE (and some say my own book is insane (thank you!))\"Radical Simplicity\" by Dan Price- a funky, journal-style entry on one man's streak of tinkering with tiny, homemade, dwellings.  \"The Art And Science of Dumpster Diving\" by John Hoffman- humorous, informative, and down n' dirty- literally. This guy has done it all! Here's a video of one of Oehler's Underground homes- almost THIRTY YEARS later! Still holdin' up!"},

The workshop is April 26th-28th....CLICK HERE for more info.... I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE secret passageways. Perhaps it was infused in me from movies like \"The Goonies\" when I was a kid, or the TV show \"Webster\" (if anyone remembers that), but I just can't resist clicking on links, videos, articles, and tours of homes with secret passages.....SO.....I was thrilled to come across one face to face while filming episode of my show \"Tiny Yellow House\" out in Seattle earlier this year (with Christopher Smith, one of the two (with Merete Mueller) behind the much anticipated \"Tiny: The Movie\").      You might have seen my video tour of Hal Colombo's 68 square foot tiny guest house (complete with a mechanical, garage-door murphy bed!) this past summer, but Hal's main house itself was actually twice as wild! Sadly, we didn't have time to film it, but I hope to return at some point- it was just TOO good of a time. The old video is below- and check out this secret Scooby-Doo-like bathroom door. This bookcase is SOLID, and hung on massive hinges, yet it swings with ease! The big ole hinges are the giveaway, but its really well designed, and the door gives way to an under-the-staircase bathroom. Hal's home, overall, is about 600 or so square feet, from what I remember him telling me. As for the guest house, YES,  you can rent it by the night- over on airbnb.com. Hal also plays in a really cool surf/garage rock band called \"The Vacant Stairs\". Funky Junk! I love it! You could spend a few hours in his living room looking around and never unearth, or ask about, all that you wanted to know and see. Filming the show, at like 6am (after that hellish flight), BEFORE heading off to speak at the Tumbleweed Tiny House Workshop.IF YOU MISSED THE VIDEO TOUR.... -Derek \"Deek\" Diedricksen"},

(Note: The rest of the room to the left is clean....)BEFOREAFTER\"No, you can't have my vintage vhs copy of 'Tremors'!\" In the photo above, the closet makeover is not 100% complete, but its getting there. The new space acts as a little reading/play nook for my kids, which they love- its very fort-like, and if I have to do any computer work while at home, they're inches behind me, so that I can keep an eye on them. HOW? TACTICS....Basically, I utilized the under-stair shelving I had installed (on stairs I also had built a few years ago, the office too...) for storage of books, magazines, and future giveaway items for the blog, AND.....I built what I call \"FLOORAGE\". Floorage is the building of a thin, boxed, floor section, ON TOP of an existing floor. Its almost like building a stage, but one that is hollow, and opens up for access and storage within. Mine was made of a few 2by6's and some left over tongue and groove cedar I had. Slap an Ikea rug and a pillow or two on top of that, and Whammo!- a simple under-stair-office makeover!TOTAL BUDGET- $45.00Naturally, some of the items I parted with, or moved elsewhere, but believe it or not, most everything fit in here, AND there's a little room to spare... The edge of the storage/floorage box also has a nice stained/trim edge now, which isn't shown in this photo. I talk about this a lil' bit in my book \"Humble Homes, Simple Shacks\", but will expand on more of these style ideas in the next book I've been working on....-Derek \"Deek\" Diedricksen"},

The workshop was a ton of fun, great people all around, great feedback, and it also gave me a chance to wander around one of my favorite cities! I first visited Chicago in 1996 while touring the U.S. with a punk band, and I fell in love with that town instantly. The art, architecture, and food- its all amazing! This workshop was my 4th visit there, and I'd love to go back.     Shown here, is a sculpture near the Navy Pier, that, to me, sets up a very simple and clever arrangement for the building of a tiny shipping container, or \"conex box\", home. These homes are becoming more and more popular, and entire books have even been devoted to their existence. While these were mere 4' by 8' models made out of routed plywood, their arrangement provides for a connected second story, AND a shaded car port, or deck area, beneath. I like how they are stacked at an angle too- I feel it makes the set-up less boxy, and less predictable.These might also make for a great screened-in tree house/fort in the woods!

The whole point of that book was to get others to just get out there and start DOING and BUILDING, and I keep getting letters from readers that support the fact that it is, in fact, working, inspiring others, and well, getting them off their asses. Well, Tyler Rodgers, has been doing anything but sitting around. I've posted the letter she sent me, which goes on to describe her little recycled-material cabin. Dear Derek \"Deek\" Diedricksen,         I'm 16, and I am just starting to put the finishing touches on my first tiny house. I'm really happy with it, and just wanted to say thanks for all the inspiration that your blog has provided throughout the whole process. The whole thing is about 90% salvaged materials. All of the wood except the 2x4 framing and plywood roof piece came from a dock that was being torn down in one of my friends' neighborhoods. That was where I got really lucky. So much free lumber! I bought each of the two windows from the Habitat for Humanity store for $5.         I based my design on kind of an enlarged version of your \"Hickshaw\" design, but really wanted to build in the spirit of the \"Gypsy Junker\", in terms of spending as little money as possible. Really, I can't say enough on how much your blog has helped. It helped me realize that building a tiny house is totally doable and relatively inexpensive if you are willing to search for free materials.      Building the house was great, but I also just love hanging out in it. I feel like a bunch of people believe that these kinds of structures will make them claustrophobic, but my house is now one of my favorite places to relax. After reading your post about hammocks, I bought one and hung it up, and now I can sit in it for hours and read or nap. I angled the house so that the windows would frame the view of the tidal creek next to it. I also just finished putting in a skylight, which allows in some additional light and can be opened in the Summer for more ventilation.      Now I'm looking forward to caulking up all of the spaces between the boards, just to make the whole structure a little bit more water-tight. I am probably also going to add more shelves, and might paint the outside, although the unpainted look has really grown on me. Again, your blog was a tremendous help.                                  Thanks, Tyler --------------------------------------------------"},
{"title": "The Natural Zome/Dome of Stuart \"Jeffrey\" Hart", "date": "Monday, November 26, 2012", "text": "I'm a huge fan of building with recycled materials (especially free/salvaged ones)- we'll talk about this, and DO IT, April 26th-28th at our Relaxshacks.com Tiny House Building Workshop in Wilmington, NC- so a guest post from Jeffrey, a reader of my blog, and a natural builder, was certainly welcomed....Here's what Jeffrey has to say.....Theproject began with an idea: by reducing the size of a house, weactually increase the space we live in. Havinga smaller homeforces us outside and into nature.Myaim was to make a well built cabin cheaply; using material destinedfor thelandfill asmuch as possible. Ifeel that much of the westernworld has become a 'throw-away' society. No longer do we repair ourbelongings when they wear out or break, but instead we thrown themaway and buy new ones. I think  knowledge of the value of materialsis being lost. Building in this way also forces me to use techniquesand materials I am not familiar with, so increases my ability andknowledge.Iwanted thecabin to be small, with room enough for only a bed, desk and smallwood stove for winter heat. Idecided on the geodesic dome as the shape for my cabin. I stayed in abeautifully crafted 30-foot wide dome house a few years ago inDunster, BC and it made a deep impression on me. The lack of emptycorners meant that I felt enveloped by the space in a unique andcomforting way. For more practical reasons, the dome structure couldcleverly be produced from reclaimed materials, soit was the ideal design solution.Aprovecho(http://www.aprovecho.net/),a sustainable education and research center in Oregon gave mepermission to build my cabin on their land. Tobegin the project I constructed a nine-foot tensideddeckusing wood salvaged from a torn down shed and concrete pierblocks that were found on site.I built small walls, known as 'ponywalls'to raise the dome so the occupant could stand in the middle. I thenbuilt the dome structure from pallet wood fastened together usingplumbing wire around hubsmadefrom PVC pipe. Idecided to add a roof on top of the dome for a number of reasons: Iworried about effectively waterproofing all of the dome’s angles; Iwanted to provide some shading for the windows in the summer; and Iwanted to earthen plaster the outside - so I'd need an overhang toprotect the plaster from the long Oregon rainy season.Towaterproof the roof, my plan was to use an old billboard canvass.Sadly I wasn't able to track one down before the rains were upon us,so I had to succumb and purchase tarpaper. I finished the roof with salvaged cedar shakes. A friend hadcollected a pile of semi-rotten shakes with the intention of usingthem as fuel. He was happy to let me rummage through them until Ifound enough good ones to finish the roof.Toinsulate the dome I used a combination of materials.  I reclaimedrigid foam from a pile of deconstruction waste.  After I ran out ofthat I used a “slip chip” made from wood shavings coated withclay slip and packed into a form.  I was also interested to try usingsheep’s wool as insulation because it is a natural, inexpensiveinsulating technique and sheep are abundant in the area. At afarmer’s market, I learned about alocal woman who let me swap a days work on her land for six bags ofher sheep's wool. I then washed the wool to clean it, carded it tofluff it up, then sprayed it with borax to prevent insectinfestation.Tofinish the outside of the dome I collected vine maple from thesurrounding forest and bent green branches around the structure. Thisacted as lathe to hold the earthen and lime plaster I smeared on as aprotective skin.Iput siding onthe pony walls in traditional board and baton style. I had left thisdetail for last because I wasn't sure what material to use. Then Ihappened upon some off-cutsfroma neighbor building a bathroom addition that just happened to be theexact size I needed, so the design finished itself.Iimprovised lathe for the inside using some pegboard (with the smoothside against the insulation) reclaimed from a workshop.NextI heldaworkshopto teach earthen plastering both to educate someof the Aprovecho interns and to complete the big plastering job inoneday.Earthenplaster is often associated with smooth rounded corners, but Ithought it would be fun to buck that trend and keep the trianglesthat make up the geodesic shape visible from the inside. The Earthenplaster was a mix of clay dug on site, plus sand and straw which wasleft over from a natural building project at  AprovechoIwanted the outside to have a rustic feel and blend into thelandscape, but once inside, I wanted a high-quality finish. Eventhough I made the cabin from reclaimed materials, I didn't want theoccupant to feel like they were living in trash, but insteadsurrounded by beautiful things that our society is too lazy to takethe time to reclaim and restore.Tofinish the inside, I paneled the pony walls with exterior sidingsalvaged from the same shed deconstruction as the decking. I spent along time planing and sanding the siding to reveal the gorgeous woodgrains. Then I finished them with linseed oil and bees wax.Ibuilt the bed and desk from pine felled and milled on site.Aprovecho’s forestor, Matt, selectively harvests only a few trees ayear to keep the forest healthy and logs them mostly using horse andhuman power.Icurved the desk edge when I realized there was not a single curve inthe entire building! Finally,I constructed the door from the remains of an old goat shed andfinished it with a porthole made from the only dimensional lumber inthe build: a lumber delivery sticker. Iran out of time before I could put in windows, but the cabin islivable for three seasons even without them. I plan to return andenlist the help of a local glasscutter to make triangular windows.  Dueto fire restrictions on site I never installed the stove I hadplanned to put in.Thetotal build took about 2 months and I ended up spending about $200 onscrews, nails, tarpaper and sand. Iwas very fortunate to be building at Aprovecho and have access totheir workshop, lumber and expertise. In the nearby town of CottageGrove, an active and like-minded community gathers weekly for afarmers market in the local used book store. Those who I told aboutmy project often offered materials, ideas or a helping hand.Ifyou are trying to build from reclaimed materials, beingopen and excited about what you are doing and speaking to whoeverwill listen is a great starting point for gathering materials. I'dalso recommend keeping an eye on craigslist and community forums anddumpster diving. Also, sometimes simply asking for offcuts atconstructions sitespays off.Whileworking on the dome I began to think about “pod living”. Sleepingin a “pod” bedroom like my dome and having central cooking,bathroom and social areas. Possibly having many pods in a co-housingstyle housing arrangement. Thiswould mean the occupant must go outside and interact with the worldaround them more often, encouraging a lifestyle that is moreconnected with nature.For example, going outside between waking and eating breakfast allowsthem to notice the small, everyday changes in the seasons and catchmany more of the special moments in a day: The brisk dawn, migratingbirds or a salmon sunset.  When talking about thisidea, many people bring up the cold and rainy days. Theseare the days when you would normally never venture outside, and soyou miss many of these moments.Ialso see pod living as a possible solution to my generation’sdilemma of home ownership. How do we live in our own homes withoutbuilding up crushing debt and being  stuck in jobs we hate for mostof our lives. What if you could build a small affordable pod and joina like-minded community? Mycabin works well as a pod at Aprovecho, where the occupant has accessto a communal kitchen, laundry and living spaces. I believe itfunctions best as part of a larger communal living situationYoucan get more info on this and other projects athttp://www.jeffreythenaturalbuilder.comFor more on recycled-material or \"Salvage\" construction, check out my book \"Humble Homes, Simple Shacks\"....."},

We'll be working on this project as a group in WILMINGTON, NC, April 26th-28th, as part of another Relaxshacks.com Tiny House Building Workshop that I'm hosting. Steven Harrell of tinyhouselistings.com will also be co-hosting this event. Many guest speakers are also soon to be announced. CLICK HERE for details and to sign up....Made almost entirely from recycled materials by Lynn Knowlton, and located outside of Toronto, this tree house/tiny house in a tree serves as a getaway, entertaining spot, and guest quarters, but it could also make for a very nice all-around tiny house/actual home as well. I especially love the attached slide, and the simple awning-style windows.

Anyway, because of that, I've had a little less time for the blog- my apologies, and part of it is because I'm still recovering from three incredible days in NYC for the Tumbleweed Tiny House Workshop I hosted out there. While in NYC, I also shot two very cool little architecture/tiny dwelling videos too- which I've also been working on.Anyway, in times like these, I love to just kick back (when I find a chance) and give my brain a rest and take a look through some of the photos I have saved on my computer, such as this one- today's EYE CANDY SHOT......a sheep wagon interior. Its so fun, yet orderly, and still cozy looking overall.  MORE coming soon....."},

Check out this cool little tiny house/escape in the trees. This micro cabin in the woods, was built and designed by Peter Bahouth. The photos are actually from a network of tree huts Peter has. Peter was the former executive director for Greenpeace USA, and is the current director of The US Climate Action Network.     This tree house uses a good deal of recycled materials, including 100-year-old windows taken from a Masonic Temple. The structures are also built so as to inflict minimal harm and damage to the trees that support them (always a great idea).This treehouse was also recently featured in the book \"My Cool Shed\" by Jane Field-Lewis- definitely worth a look- some great photos within!

WHY? Instead of sinking then countersinking finish nails or brads, or dragging out the air compressor and nail gun, the heads of these screws are so small (yet still large enough to hold strong) that you can get away with using them for finish work in many cases!    These have definitely been a time saver on the set for us, so check 'em out if you have a chance.

{"title": "10 Sheds/Cabins- Would You Live In These? (and \"My Cool Shed\" Book Review)", "date": "Wednesday, October 10, 2012", "text": "DO SCROLL DOWN for a cool gallery of over TEN shed/cabin interiors and exteriors! BOOK REVIEW: \"My Cool Shed\" by Jane Field Lewis and Tina Hillier Overall Grade: B+First, I'll note that I was/am a very big fan of Lewis' first book \"My Cool Caravan\"- if you haven't checked that out, and are into that scene, its a rather well done visual overview on some AMAZING micro/mobile dwellings....my father bought me a copy for a gift, and I later bought a copy as a gift for a friend.     Anyway, as for \"My Cool Shed\" this is the third (and thinnest- 159 pp) offering of the trio of books from this author, and while I DO love the photos, the layout, and most of the selections, I can't help but feel that the book was a little rushed layout-wise, perhaps so as to hop on the still hot trail and success of the other releases (and I'm sure another is already in the works). My Cool Treehouse? My Cool Tent? My Cool Doghouse? Laugh it up, but just you wait.....(And I'd probably buy the former two).    Back on track, there are some GREAT photos in here, but also a few full page and 1.5 page ones that just seem to be a waste of space (a light bulb by a plywood wall needed more than a full page spread?). A decent chunk of the sheds and cabins featured have already been featured in many other similar books too- especially the classic author sheds of \"George Bernard Shaw\", \"Dylan Thomas\", and so on- however, if you don't own 4023 tiny architecture books, as I do, and haven't seen those sheds a few times already, this would be a GOOD thing- they are classics, and they are clever, attractive, n' cool.    BUT....BUT...aside from a few critiques (and I hope you made it this far, as I have many good things to say as well!) this book is still leagues better than other genre offerings out there (although perhaps not as compared to Alex Johnson's very recent \"Shedworking\"). \"My cool shed\" is also pretty darn eclectic, which I do love, and features a couple of builds/cabins which I have never-ever seen before- one killer tree house too! I do like the quality of the print, the paper, and the hardcover aspect of this too. Its a pretty classy book and a great tome that is chock full of photographic ideas for those in search of a future shed-escape.     All in all, its a very good eye-candy ride through the world of tiny cabins and sheds (all inspirational, and not instructional, which I'm more than fine with), and while not THE BEST book on the subject out there, if sheds are your thing, this one would still rank pretty high up there. I'm certainly not sorry I spent the money, its just tough to beat \"My Cool Caravan\" when Lewis set her own bar so high.Here are some interior photos of some of this book's content, and a link below, so you can decide for yourself.LINKS to LEWIS' BOOK- Mine as well..... -Derek \"Deek\" Diedricksen"},

Tumbleweed Boston, MA- tba 2013Tumbleweed Austin, TX- tba 2013Tumbleweed Nashville, TN- tba 2013Yestermorrow Tiny House Workshop- VT- Summer 2013 Anyway, long-story-short, Sharkbite Plumbing fixtures, which you can get just about ANYWHERE now, have been aggravating plumbers worldwide, as with them, in many cases, you can now do your own plumbing as if you were simply building and snapping together tinkertoys (remember those?). DO KEEP IN MIND that certain other jobs, especially gas pipe fittings, are best left to qualified Plumbers, all around good people who know their \"you know what\" inside and out- but a good many of the smaller task can now be taken care of with ease. Buy the right attachment, bend, spigot, or splitter, cut the copper or pex tubing to the length you need, and simply push the piece in place until its seated and held firm. That's it! There's a tool that undoes the connections as well, if need be. This stuff IS expensive, but saves you a ton of time and frustration, so you'll have to weigh the cost/benefit ratio. The piece shown, which I used when replacing some piping and installing a new kitchen sink the other day was $14.99. Why is it great for tiny houses??Well, if you're in a very confined area, doing solder and torch work on traditional copper plumbing runs, chances are you'll be running that torch close to a wooden 2x4 sooner or later- especially given your space limitations. Keep in mind that fire and wood aren't a great mix when it comes to your expensive, and long-worked-on, tiny house. THIS is why I do recommend the stuff to those building a tiny house, travel trailer, or who simply want a quick and simple fix. I also am still LOVING this Ikea Solar Desk Light, its flexible neck was PERFECT for under-sink plumbing work the other day, and freed up my hands!I posted a link to them on amazon below so that you could read up on them- specs, etc. Note: They are MUCH cheaper if you have an Ikea near you, but for those who don't, I've provided the link.  -Derek \"Deek\" Diedricksen"},

I never knew, and was clueless as to how manyother people out there were as equally obsessed with the notion of tinyliving as I was.

By their portability, these rooms for rent can be relocated to meet tourist demands in different parts of the country, through the highs and lows of different seasons. Not to shabby, and I love the hanging/lofted beds, which are positioned so as to take advantage of a triangular clerestory-like window.    Note: The photo above is deceiving from the angle its taken, as you'll see in the interior photos below. -Derek \"Deek\" DiedricksenCheck out this tiny house/playhouse that was built by the Habitat For Humanity crew in Fort Jackson, Mississippi! I love the front array of windows, the interior colors (mostly), and the micro second floor. The horizontally laid tongue and groove walls look great as well.      If you really take a look at this, especially from the outside, its got the makings of a GREAT looking tiny house or cabin for adults, never mind kids.

{"title": "The 1910 Dietz \"Dollhouse\"....Tiny House Eye Candy- A Micro-Victorian House", "date": "Thursday, September 27, 2012", "text": "From the Seguin, TX Historical Society's Website (and thanks to Don Siders for pointing us in the site's direction).                            Dietz Doll House (1910)            415 S. Austin St.            The Dietz Doll House is one of the Seguin Conservation Society's most charming properties and like the others, comes with an intriguing history. It was built in 1910 by Louis Dietz for little Alice O'Brien, 5 years old, who had come to Seguin as an orphan train child.            Alice was born on May 28, 1905, in the New York Foundling Hospital in New York City. In those days, orphan or homeless children were transported by train to various small towns throughout the United States for adoption. In Seguin, Alice was taken in by John and Julia Magin, but nine months later, Mrs. Magin died. A German-born carpenter, Louis Dietz and his sister, Miss Mollie, applied to the Catholic Parish priest to raise Alice in their home.            Alice moved to her second home May 10, 1910, about the time Louis Dietz built the Victorian doll house for her. The little house was originally located on the right side of the tree-shaded back yard of Louis and Miss Mollie's house at 423 N. Milam Street. Some people in Seguin remember that in the 1920's The Doll House sat at the left side of the Dietz Cabinet Shop facing N. Milam Street. In time, The Doll House was moved again to create an entrance for the Dietz house.            Louis worked in his cabinet shop next door at 427 N. Milam Street. He built ornate furniture and crafted unique items of wood — rocking horses, gray elephants, humpback camels, and animals on wheels. Another of his specialties was making different kinds of wooden fruit - bunches of grapes and watermelons. Equally distinctive were decorative clock shelves painted to look like marble. A child-size wardrobe and dresser made by Louis are on display in The Doll House.            Pablo Castilla and his son, Ralph, gave the Dietz Doll House to the Seguin Conservation Society in 1967. See it next to Los Nogales Museum at 415 S. River Street.If you're going into tiny house living for simplicity, and lack of maintenance. this might not be the model you want to emulate though- that scroll work and fancy trim would be more than a pain to paint. -Derek \"Deek\" Diedricksen"},
{"title": "Tiny Houses/Tumbleweeds: To Skylight, or NOT to Skylight?", "date": "Wednesday, September 26, 2012", "text": "This question has been posed at EVERY Tumbleweed Workshop I've hosted (Boston, Miami, Chicago, DC, Seattle, NYC, Middle Earth, Atlantis, etc), and I'm sure we'll talk about it, both your opinions and mine, in the upcoming NYC Tumbleweed Tiny House Workshop in Brooklyn, NY- October 20th and 21st. This particular workshop will feature Christopher Smith and Merete Mueller, the duo behind the much anticipated \"Tiny: The Movie\"- who have recently completed their own tiny house on wheels. More guest to be announced soon too.....CLICK HERE FOR MORE INFO.SKYLIGHTS- SHOULD I INCLUDE THEM IN MY TINY HOUSE'S LOFT?This could apply to houses of ANY size, but more particularly to tiny houses, as their loft space is so comparatively limited....First of all, in the \"pro-skylight\" column, just look at this photo of a simple lofted sleeping area in a tiny house- I mean how cool, cozy, and inviting does this look? I love it. On the other hand, you're losing heat like crazy, r-value-wise, if you don't have high end, insulated, double-paned, skylights. However, this heat loss, as your loft will ALWAYS be the warmest place in your tiny home, might also come as a blessing.Now on the other hand, take the above example- this converted attic could have possibly benefited from the additional light and venting abilities of a skylight or two, BUT with the inclusion of a decent sized window on the gable end of the home, the lighting in this little loft seems to be just fine.The CONS of skylights.....well, even with the most thorough flashing and trim work, ANY TIME you add an roof penetrations or complications (toilet stacks, electrical poles/goose necks, dormers, and yes, skylights) THAT will be the place, most prone, down the road, to leakage. SO, by not having any skylights, you're more or less eliminating this increased risk, but at the cost of less light, and in some cases, ventilation. If you live in a particularly rainy and windy region of the country, or oceanside, where the weather can be rather brutal, for this reason, skylights should be carefully considered. But its not that cut and dry.....as you'll see in photo #3, Jay Shafer's original Tumbleweed Tiny House....This cool little loft, above, is pretty darn cozy, and with only one lancet/gothic window, its also on the dark side- which sleep-wise, I really love (I prefer sleeping in pitch black rooms). That can either be a pro or con, but in terms of a off chance fire or emergency, those who choose to only install small windows in their lofts are faced with the challenge of squeezing through them for egress if need be. With a skylight, on the other hand, whether its meant to open or not, come fire, or any other dire situation, one swift kick to the glass and you can make your way out- It won't be pretty, granted, but you will be alive.PRO- Larger windows, or skylights, just may help you in terms of your being able to load long, or bulkier items into your loft- ones that otherwise would not fit up through the small entrance hole (if not an open loft set-up). PRO and CON- Solar gain is another thing to consider, and this will all depend on where you live, where your house is situated and in which direction its located. Skylights on a south facing roof will collect alot of heat during the day in your loft. If your home is parked under the shade of a tree in the summer, this skylight gain will be greatly reduced. In colder climates, this solar gain, on the other hand, might be exactly what you want.CON- Skylight shades always seem to be problematic and a good many people just don't bother with outfitting them with their custom shades- AND when those shades break, they're slow to replace them. The result: When the sun is up, you're up- unless you own a sleep mask.Skylights with built-in interior, between glass, shades- forget it, they always end up breaking over time- at least in cases I've seen. Above: Skylights put to good use- Dee Williams of Portland Alternative Dwellings, in her Tumbleweed. Note how the skylights are staggered and both are not situated on one end of the home- this arrangement is less apt to structurally weaken your tiny home (especially important if its one on wheels that will be moved often). PRO- Who doesn't want to sleep with a clear view of the stars overhead? It'd be like sleeping in a stargazers field, but without the bugs, cold, and manure under your feet. Same with the rain overhead- to be so close to the elements, yet so protected, comfortable, and dry, is something to be experienced. Its one of the reasons that I love installing clear poly roofing on many of my small shelter structures.And I'm sure there are other reasons, for and against, that can be added to this conversation, and perhaps, that's where you come in.

People have been ringing to ask what on earth it is, so there’s lots of interest already. If the demand is there, there could be hundreds across the city within the next year. We came up with the idea because we can’t meet the demand for rental accommodation in central North Oxford.\" Oxford is one of the most expensive places to rent in the UK with an average rent of £891 a month – £185 more than the average for the rest of the country.

{"title": "THE BEECH TREE COTTAGES (a tiny house/cottage compound) in Madison, CT", "date": "Wednesday, September 12, 2012", "text": "Madison, CT, a small shoreline town, is where I grew up. Its a very picturesque little town- great beaches, good people, and gorgeous homes- but one, where for years there resided a run down, past-its-glory cottage camp right by Hammonassett State Park (CT's LARGEST Public Beach). Even as a kid, there was something I always loved about not only small homes, but this particular marsh-side camp, and it was sad to see it become more and more derelict as the years went on. The grass grew higher, the window panes fell victim to vandalism and neglect, and total ruin seemed imminent.    THANKFULLY, THIS WAS NOT THE OUTCOME....         In the late-90s, it appeared (and such is the case), that a family with some foresight, and who appreciated the area, view, and locale as much as I did, decided to buy the place, and fix it up. Little by little, as it must have been a monumental task, this former gathering of cottages began to look not good, but GREAT again. Now, many years later, the cottages serve once again as lodging, the former Esso gas station out front has been transformed into a home for the owners, The on-site icehouse is now a super funky and unique gift shop dubbed \"The Little Station\" (www.thelittlestation.wordpress.com), and the landscaping has been more than tamed.     I'm happy to be able to share a few photos with you, as I finally had the chance to check out these little houses up close and personally.

{"title": "Making Outdoor Space part of your Tiny House Living", "date": "Tuesday, September 11, 2012", "text": "Here's another unusual example, which would work great where the terrain of one's lot, or even the size of it might not otherwise allow you to build an outdoor deck, or configure any kind of outdoor living patio into the overall scheme of your small or tiny living experience. \"Extend your living space outdoors\" is one of the oldest tricks in the small-space-design book, and one that is very effective. Doing so while extending and continuing your lines of sight can be additionally helpful in many layout cases. Of course, outdoor living space can more so become TRUE living space in warmer climates, while in places like New England, where I live, its relegated to more of a seasonal option- BUT, its a tactic that still visually tricks the mind and makes a room feel bigger than it is, or gives one more room to lounge and live in the great outdoors- tax-free, in some cases too.  The photo example given may be atop more of a playhouse, but the idea is still there: You can take things not only outward, but upward.

Even a photo such as this one- and its not meant to be a full time house, granted- gives you a general idea as to how big this tree house/stilt-house-cabin is, and from there its a simple exercise in spatial layouts.....and well, daydreaming....I usually make a running checklist in my mind, just to see how I can make even the smallest of cabins, houses, or what others deem \"forts\", liveable. For instance....I WOULD...-Create a sleep loft is enough space were available, if not, a fold down bed, or a bed-slash-long desk conversion might be an option.-Extend the deck a little, and put a canopy or roof over it so as to extend my living space outdoors- which is a simple trick that always helps.-Add a place to hang a hammock both indoors and out (same single hammock), which could serve as a lounging, couch-like place to read and watch tv from.-Have one wall ENTIRELY composed of bookshelves and cubbies, which could be hidden (out of sight, out of mind) by a storage curtain. One LARGE shelf pocket could also contain a mini sink (with window in the back of it) and \"counter space\" to prepare small meals. Another could hold a microwave, or a single-burner camp stove (propane, a la the Coleman ones).-Get rid of the track/sliding door (too drafty!), and replace it with a \"real\" door that opens OUTWARD to save interior space.-Raise this little office cabin (or so it appears) a little higher and build-in a deck space directly beneath the structure, for shaded, outdoor hang-out space (also a place to park bikes, or hang tools (against one added outdoor wall perhaps). If you later needed more living space, this area could easily be enclosed.-Toilet? There's the tricky one in so tight a space- weather/climate/region permitting, you could possibly go with an outhouse, or cantilever a little more space (a tiny, tiny, room) off one end (even just 3' by 4') and make it a wet bath, with an ultra small boat toilet, or a composting unit.-Heat the cabin with a small, oil-circulating, electric radiator (you would only need to run it on its lowest setting), or a Dickinson Boat Stove- those things are GREAT! ...And you get the idea!Like I said, its a fun little mental/design exercise I like to often challenge myself with...-Derek \"Deek\" Diedricksen- -- -"},

Just costs less to build overall2. Requires fewer materials to build- which is much easier on landfills and the environment- assuming you're not tearing down another home to build a tiny one (if so- RECYCLE/RE-USE those materials!)3. Can be built QUICKER- no sitting around, piling and shuffling materials, coordinating a year-long build and its deliveries and contracts, and paying double rent elsewhere to live while the project is underway.4. Takes up less space, leaving you MORE outdoor living space/land for enjoyment, gardening, and privacy (in terms of a spatial buffer zone).5. Costs MUCH LESS to heat! In an era of ever-increasing gas and oil prices, this one is huge. Conversely, a tiny house costs less to COOL too. 6. Costs less to furnish. I have a friend who has and \"had\" to buy five couches- for five huge rooms with sitting areas- just to FILL the space. CRAZY, and expensive. DON'T be that guy. 7. Costs less to maintain. How long would it take you to repaint a tiny house as compared to a McMansion? To re-roof one? Re-shingle it? And what about the cost difference in paints and materials, nevermind the labor.8. Costs less in taxes.9. Prohibits you from buying impulse junk you really don't need. You CAN'T buy these sorts of things as you KNOW you just don't have the space.10. Doesn't take as long to clean. Heck, some of them are so small you might not even need to buy/store a vacuum (use a broom), or you could get away with a portable \"dust buster\" instead.11. (On Wheels)- They're mobile- if the job market changes, or an area goes economically sour, you can move your house with you! No packing all your things into a costly moving truck, as YOUR HOME is that moving truck!12. Less to lose. I hate to even think of it, in the case of fire, flooding, and so on, but its not a $400,000 home you're losing. If you can find insurance for your tiny home or travel trailer, its less of a premium/yearly cost too.13. (On Wheels)- As the seasons change, you can MOVE your house so as to face away, or towards, the sun- Winter vs. Summer, depending on your climate, and orientation in regards to the equator.14. Unwanted/surprise guests are less likely to stay for long periods of time or stay overnight for too long- there just isn't room for them. With the money SAVED by living in a tiny house, as Dee Williams (from Portland Alternative Dwellings) explains, you can rent a hotel ballroom, or a function hall once in awhile, if you're the party hosting sort.15. Hurricane avoiding....when the news reports that Katrina II is headed your way, if you live in a tiny house on wheels, you can get the heck out of Dodge, or park the home inside a pre-arranged, safer, storage building or garage.AND THESE ARE JUST OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD- there are MANY more reasons, I'm sure- feel free to add yours in the comments below!SOME GREAT RESOURCES, if you're contemplating making the move.... www.TINYHOUSEBLOG.comwww.TINYHOUSEDESIGN.comwww.TUMBLEWEEDHOUSES.com www.TINYHOUSETALK.comwww.TINYHOUSELISTINGS.comwww.LLOYDKAHN.comwww.TINYREVOLUTION.USwww.TINY-THEMOVIE.comThere are MANY others, which I've blogged about many times, on this blog too....-Derek \"Deek\" Diedricksen"},

This was the (somewhat recent) finale competition on the program Design Star All Stars, and while I didn't see a single other episode of the show (I don't have cable tv), and hear that the overall track record of the show's winner was better, I still think, as far as this last contest went, contestant Hilari Younger got robbed.

Nothing I would personally choose to live in, style wise, but its just fun and ballsy at the same time. Here are FIVE books dealing with shipping container architecture and pre-fabricated and eco-housing....some deal with tiny, and/or small/modest sized houses too....just some books/links to peruse...-Derek \"Deek\" DiedricksenEarlier this summer, while in China Maine, I took a few new snapshots of this little bunkhouse (which appears in the photo gallery of my book \"Humble Homes, Simple Shacks\"), and its newly installed, super tiny bathroom. The bathroom was a former closet, and is a mere 4' by 4' in its floor layout. The tiny sink was salvaged from another collapsing cabin in the woods and given a new life here. Dana Sennett, former mayor of the city of Waterville, ME is the proud builder/owner of this lil' cabin by the lake. This building was formerly a wood shed too, believe it or not.

{"title": "A PORCUPINE-shaped tiny house/cabin? ", "date": "Saturday, August 25, 2012", "text": "If you've read the short encounter chapter in my tiny-housing book \"Humble Homes, Simple Shacks\", you know that Porcupines in Vermont have become my mortal enemies. I do find them very interesting, but man can they destroy the siding of a cabin VERY quickly...regardless, I really dig this little sculptural cabin....This one is just wild- and was created by artists at the San Francisco \"Recology\" center- with the focus of several exhibit builds being \"recycled materials\"- fittingly. As many of you know, I'm a big fan of fun, and whimsical tiny dwellings- and this one certainly fits the bill! No interior photos were provided at www.recology.com, but its still fascinating enough, even if only given an outside vantage. Above is another very cool offering from the same event....spherical structures are very hard to furnish, and are very space inefficient though....From RECOLOGY:Suzanne Husky: Sleeper Cell RaisingThe wealth of materials available to Suzanne Husky during her residency at the dump enabled her to construct small habitable structures that had previously existed only in her drawings. The artist’s intention for these forms, which appear like tiny homes for characters in a folk tale, is that they be placed in a forest or garden, potentially to be slept in. While the shelters in nature-inspired shapes such as a porcupine convey a humorous charm, Husky’s description of them as “sleeper cells” alludes to more sober concerns—people living off the grid in anticipation of an environmental apocalypse, ecoterrorists mobilizing in forest hide-outs, and a metaphorical rising up of nature against encroaching industry and technology. Structures are furnished with the cast-offs of consumer culture and are even on wheels, allowing for the easy deployment of this woodland force. Husky received her MFA in 2000 from the Beaux-Arts School in Bordeaux, France. She has had residencies at the deYoung Museum in San Francisco and at Pollen Monflanquin near Bordeaux; her work will be included in Bay Area Now 6 at Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in 2011.As for recycled materials and building on the East Coast front, boy oh boy do I have LOADS of stuff we can play with and incorporate into the building of a new tiny dwelling/guest house at our Relaxshacks.com \"Tiny House-Building Workshop\" Nov 2-4, in Stoughton, MA.

{"title": "But won't someone STEAL my tiny house on wheels?", "date": "Monday, August 20, 2012", "text": "THE THREE QUESTIONS I MOST OFTEN GET WHILE HOSTING TINY HOUSE-BUILDING WORKSHOPS....-But where are tiny houses allowed?-Where do you go to the bathroom? (toilet/facility set-ups)-Won't someone steal your tiny house on wheels? The first two have been covered many times over on several blogs, ranging from tinyhouseblog.com to tinyhousetalk.com, tinyhousedesign.com and  thetinylife.com, but I rarely see any attention given to the theft question.Below is part of a response comment I left on Kent Griswold's blog, with much other info I have now added....A lot of people always bring up the \"won't people steal it\" question, but its not as likely to happen as people might think, in fact, I've personally not heard of a case yet. Hopefully this will give some a bit of comfort...as we've talked a bit about it at each of the Tumbleweed Workshops I've hosted, and my own workshops....(again, there's one coming up Nov 2-4 in Boston, where we'll all build a tiny dwelling together). kidcedar at gmail dot com for info. PREVENTATIVE MEASURES, and the \"WHY NOT\".... -First, with a heavy duty chain you can simply lock it (your tiny house) down to a tree or two, making it very time consuming and difficult to steal. One could also self-boot it (perhaps even remove the tire(s) from one side (simple to do) so that it can't be easily transported). Most thieves want the quick steal, and not something that requires an hour or so of tree felling, and multiple people, to acquire.-Secondly, a thief, unless he/she had ample time to hide something so enormous and strip it, would be driving around sticking out like a sore thumb with any form of tiny house- structures which are still very much so huge novelties in the general scheme of things to those not familiar with the scene. I know of many people who have never even heard of the concept, never mind seen a tiny house on wheels. Anyway, if you stole a tiny house, where are you going to hawk it without being noticed, and remembered, by every person you pass? It'd be like stealing a ferris wheel- the down-low factor is terrible, making it almost impossible to resell. -Third Tactic....if you plan on leaving it permanently at a site (or for a prolonged period), and have the means, why not just shove a few large boulders in front of, or around it, with a bulldozer? Any tiny-house burglar would now have to have access and the foresight to bring a bulldozer to the scene of the crime, to remove those rocks so as to give the tiny house a free passageway. Thats A LOT of work, and noisy work, to steal ANYTHING. Yeah, a tiny house is very valuable, but this ain't \"The Thomas Crown Affair\".-Number Four- When I was in my teens I toured with a pop-punk/rock band by the name of \"Rail\" from Rochester, NY (Ringing Ear Records). When staying at a motel, especially in a shady area, we'd back the loading doors of a van or U-haul against a wall. Why? The theory is, if they don't have enough room to swing open the doors to steal all the larger gear that can only be unloaded through those very doors, then the gear just can't be removed. Now apply that to a tiny house, but in a slightly different way: If you can't hitch up a tiny house, you can't tow if off the scene. To employ this method, you'd have to unhitch the tiny house, then winch it, tongue-first, into a tight spot (the trailer neck/hitch end). Now, ultimately, its going to take some hard \"unwinching\" work to get the house into a free and clear spot, where it could then be hitched up tp a vehicle and stolen. Most thieves just aren't going to bother.Five- Fake cameras- I talk about this in my tiny house design/concept book \"Humble Homes, Simple Shacks\". Basically, hang a fake camera somewhat near the tiny house, high up on a pole or tree for instance, but somewhere in clear view. This sounds goofy, but beneath it, tack a small, official looking sign that simply reads \"#5\". In reality you only have one camera hung, and its a cheap fake one (they sell kits- see below), but by having it numbered \"#5\", any prospective \"hooligan\" is going to think twice before doing anything stupid or illegal near your site. He or she will be thinking, \"If this is camera #5, then there must be at least four others, and how many of these have I been captured on already!?\". Again, its simple and goofy, but its not going to hurt.     A sign on the door of your cabin reading, \"I hope you smiled for our seven cameras\" might work too.And there are a few sample ideas, and some reasoning as to why its just less likely that someone is going to steal your tiny house anyway. Vandalism is a whole other beast, but any homeowner, or seasonable cabin dweller, has to face this same problem. Any other suggestions, PLEASE post them in the comment section below, I'd love to hear them! Thanks!-Derek \"Deek\" Diedricksen Check out this new video from the \"Peak Moment\" series- its a little long, and I wish it focused more on the scenery/interiors, but its a worthwhile video, on a great little free-form, tiny cabin/house. Greg, who lives in this house half of each year (while traveling the other half), made this home from almost ALL recycled materials, and comes off as a well spoken guy- someone who'd be interesting to have a few beers with, while chatting about anything.Recycled materials...YUP, we'll be teaching and showing you how to employ them into a tiny house build (one YOU will help create) at our next Tiny House-Building Workshop on Nov 2-4 just outside Boston, MA.

{"title": "Kids Forts as Models For Tiny Houses??? A look-out tower modern home?", "date": "Thursday, August 16, 2012", "text": "From time to time here on relaxshacks.com I like to post photos of rather unique and interesting kids forts, playhouses, treehouses, and clubhouses. The reason I do this is because I feel there is always something to be architecturally learned from the simplest, or most elaborate, of child \"dwellings\"- ideas, decor approaches, use of space, and interesting contours, that can all be possibly placed and utilized in the world of \"real\" tiny house design. Designers of such structures are allowed, it seems, to take more chances on these type builds, mainly because of the lack of risk, and the lower overall cost of such a project- you're not going to experiment with one million dollars of a clients money to build something like the fort shown above, right? Whatever the case, I just love the fact that the two fields COULD and CAN very much overlap- if you choose.Above, yet another kid clubhouse that might make for a nice tiny house if enlarged. The pole-construction nature of it would also lend well to uneven plots of land, marshy areas, or those prone to flooding.  Sometimes the purists complain, or inwardly whine \"Deek, this isn't true to the game! You're off target and need to ONLY report on Tumbleweeds, Vardos, and Micro-Cottages! I'm taking my views elsewhere!\"To those, I urge you to go instead to www.youaretakingyourselfwaytooseriously.com, or www.gimmeafugginbreak.com.Anyway, I still stand by the ties, and really liked the look of this tower-like playhouse- a photo taken by Holly Gomez over at www.aplaceimagined.blogspot.com. Yes, its not practical, but I'm big fan of attempting to bring fun, lightheartedness, and hell, even child-like whimsy, into structures here and there. Why not making a dwelling fun to look at, as well as functional?I'm also working on a list of GREAT books on this subject matter (posted soon), as there are many that are often overlooked. One, for starters, is this offering from David and Jeanie Stiles- two of the more talented names in the kids fort, and tiny structure, world.

As I've mentioned, my 10 acres in Vermont has always been my experimenting grounds, and photo subject-matter for my \"Humble Homes, Simple Shacks\" book, but the upkeep on so many structures does get time consuming.

The camera is TINY too, and affordable.        Well, I've been on the road quite a bit the last several weeks, from DC (teachinga Tumbleweed Tiny House Company Workshop), to Northern Vermont (another upcoming mini-filmed/episode on my youtube \"relaxshacksDOTcom\" channel), and even Unity, Maine, to visit Melissa and Rocy Pillsbury of Wooden-Wonders.com. While there I filmed an upcoming how-to episode for Make Magazine, using their cool little hobbit huts/shacks/cabins/holes as a backdrop- and had a blast (well, it was hot as all heck, but still fun).  Anyway, the episode is in the works and won't be out for awhile, but in the meantime, here's a few photos I took while on the premises- photos that will most likely (some of them) end up in my next tiny housing/small dwelling/shacks book- a follow-up to \"Humble Homes, Simple Shacks\" (below)- which still keeps hitting #1 for Carpentry books on all of Amazon.com here and there- THANK YOU!  I was hoping to possibly get a Hobbit Hut on site for the Relaxshacks.com Tiny House-Building Workshopon Nov 2-4 in Stoughton/Boston MA, but no word yet. I'd LOVE to film a \"Pimp My Hobbit Hut\" episode or two and really, really deck one of these out properly. We'll keep you updated, and to those who want to sign up for, or need more info on our hands-on building workshop- CLICK HERE!Again, recently added, day three of the workshop we will visit THE VERY FIRST BUILT TUMBLEWEED TINY HOUSE!

In addition to all the speakers, the collective building project, the camping, the tiny cabin touring, AND MORE- on Sunday, as the workshop's third day wraps up, we'll all head out to visit THE FIRST-BUILT TUMBLEWEED TINY HOUSE in Boston....which you'll love. This is the very first one that Jay Shafer built in Iowa, and lived in- what a great little place. A visit to this tiny house on wheels is sure to give you some great ideas in terms of tiny house design and spatial arrangement. And this is in addition to all the other tiny structures we'll be seeing, the many guest speakers, and so on. To SIGN UP or FIND MORE INFO on this workshop happening November 2-4- CLICK HERE!  We did an open house at this place months back, and I've filmed a tour video as well (below). Before the open house I was asked a ways back to give the place (which hadn't been lived in for a long time) a make-over. The total amount spent was $162.00, and the goal was to make it more fun, colorful n' funky! Below are some more photos of the very home you'll be seeing as part of our \"Relaxshacks.com Tiny House-Building Workshop #3\"- right outside Boston, MA.Again, this workshop is being limited to 20 attendees, so as to keep it intimate and very hands-on, so don't wait! -Derek \"Deek\" Diedricksen"},
{"title": "Lost Love For The Bucket- the OTHER Tools for building your tiny house", "date": "Wednesday, August 8, 2012", "text": "Not the most sensational-sounding, or super-exciting blog post, eh? Hear me out though..... While teaching tiny house-building workshops on my own (Nov 2-4 we have another one coming up near Boston), and for the Tumbleweed Tiny House Company, in addition to Jay Shafer's list of the 14 tools needed to build his tiny houses, I also list several of the tools that I've personally found invaluable. This list ranges from archaic hand tools (for off-grid work), to a surform, coping saw, tarps (yes, they can be considered a tool), A nail gun and air tank (hugely time saving for larger jobs), and buckets....YES, BUCKETS.....These little $5.00 jobbers (if you purchase them and can't find 'em free), have many uses, and have saved my butt many a time while in the midst of a building project for a video, a client, or myself. I always make sure I have many of them on hand, as you never know when they might make themselves useful.TEN WAYS IN WHICH BUCKETS can be a HUGE HELP on the BUILDING SITE....1. Storage- If you're caught in the middle of a downpour, buckets with lids make for a quick stash spot for your tools, nails, and materials.2. Saw Horses- use two of them to bridge a piece of wood you're working on, and you'll save your knees from a little extra bending (if you were working on the ground).3. Carrying Water- for mixing cement, putting out fires, rinsing/cleaning tools/materials. 4. Hauling Dry Goods- tools, nails, and whatever else- its especially helpful for large amounts of small tools.5. Step Stool- a bucket will hold a heck of alot of weight when flipped upside-down, and get you 18\" or so higher.6. Collecting Water- while building off-grid and in need of water for mixing cement, a tarp rigged to collect rainwater can be channeled into a bucket for such needs.7. MIX CEMENT IN THEM- a mixing vessel for small batches, and carrying vehicle, in one.8. Trash Receptacle- pretty self explanatory, as a clean work site is a safe and efficient one.9. A composting/sawdust toilet- if there are no facilities around the site you happen to be working on.  ....And I'm sure there are more uses! If you have any, please add them here....And check out details for our Nov 2-4 Tiny House-Building Workshop right outside Boston, MA-Derek \"Deek\" Diedricksen"},

Its got alot going for it- its simple and easy to build, could incorporate nothing but free and salvaged windows as it has such an asymmetrical design, resides on a mere four legs, achieves a rustic, modern, and fun look without being a budget-buster, and would give you a great view if placed in the right setting- both through its multitude of windows and its height.Modern Kids design by Nashville Design-build Bjon PankratzYeah, again, its a kids fort or playhouse mainly, but why not trick it out for adult use?

A very comfortable chair- I got this one for a friends as a gift for $75 from Goodridge Lumber up in Albany, VT, my go-to place for cedar.    Something like this would be VERY easy to build- its all patterns. I've since seen many copycat looks and models- a sure sign that the design sells, works, and it wanted/people-approved.   A chair like this would be great for a tiny/small house in terms of guest seating. When not in use, you could stow this away easily, or even hang it up on a wall. I took the pattern measurements down for this on some scrap of paper SOMEWHERE, and once I find them, I'll have to post them.

{"title": "Introducing \"The Darrington\"- a tiny, panelized, prefabricated cabin....", "date": "Thursday, August 2, 2012", "text": "Among many other things, I've been working a little on this idea-\"The Darrington\". The name is a spin/nod to Kevin Harrington of Cozyhomeplans.com who has been a huge helper/supporter of Relaxshacks.com.    I've been brainstorming as to what we should all collectively build at our third \"Tiny House Building Workshop\"- Nov 2-4 in Massachusetts, and this was ONE of my ideas....Click to ENLARGE  For more details on the workshop, its guest speaker roster, and how to sign up, CLICK HERE....This little structure is 8' by 12', could be enlarged with ease, and could include (and might/will) a tiny bathroom, and a semi-lofted/bunked bed set-up. Oh yeah, the huge corrugated/clear wall lifts up to transform the cabin into an open air pavilion, or a beach hut of sorts, in better weather! This hut is designed as a little guest house/hut, a shed for home-office work, or a yoga/art studio, as mentioned in the sketch. My main intentions are for it also to be a simple vacation cabin for those (most of us) who don't have money falling out of our kiesters (there's some imagery!). Ahem....my apologies....Something like this, with a recycled doors, windows, and even some lumber, could EASILY be built for under $2000.00- and that includes the paint job, and more. If it works out, I might eventually draw up a full set of step by step plans.  THE DESIGN CRITERIA FOR \"TINY HOUSE BUILDING WORKSHOP #3\"- Boston, MABasically, in a short period of time, here's what I'm aiming for...-Its got to be a project that many people can work on at the same time (hence, its panelized, and becomes a teamwork-assembling effort). People sitting around and doing nothing is no good, I want people to get some good hands-on time with this weekend project.-It has to be small as we only have two-three days to work on it, AND to hear from a ton of guest speakers at the workshop. Daylight is limited too- we're fighting the clock there....-It can't cost a million dollars to build, as mistakes will be made (half the fun, and ALL the learning experience), and because, well, I really don't need another cabin in my yard- my wife is going to KILL me!-It also has to incorporate many facets of building, for those who have, and haven't, much experience swinging hammers....    All in all, The Darrington's build will cover/include many/most of the standards: framing, show the benefits of pre-fabrication, sheathing, the \"glue n' screw\" technique, roofing work/poly wall work, painting/decor, base building/setting, and some other less conventional techniques, allowing us (and making us) all think outside the box. Again, this is but one idea, but one of the one's I'm liking more than some of the others I have behind the scenes.....MORE TO COME!-Derek \"Deek\" Diedricksen"},

As some of you might know, I'm a fan of both coffee-table style pictoral books, AND more text laden offerings, and this book certainly falls into the former category. Books like these can be very inspiring, fun, and informational, even if only in a photographic and visual way, and this book is most of those things. Tereasa Surratt is almost the female \"me\", the more I look through this book- just one hell a better dresser (she's flea marketing and scrounging in outfits nicer than what I would wear to church!)- she digs recycled goods, yard sales, isn't afraid to get dirty (despite some of the pristine and poised photos), and well, LOVES tiny houses. She's even written a flea-marketing book- which I've also linked below (another one with some great photos- whoever is taking the pics (her, I assume) has a good eye for detail, light, and thinking beyond the box).      While this book is about ONE single tiny house, and its history in the line of roadside rental cottages from the days of old, its LOADED with some very cool imagery- most of which lend to the tale of an old tiny cabin being saved, hauled across two states, and untimately relocated and rennovated. The end product is pretty damn gorgeous, and all in all, its a very fun, and non-brain-busting book to flip through time and time again.You can find out more about her and her work at averymodestcottage.com, which I hear, is now being rented out...."},

Shipping container houses are often pegged by some as being too industrial and cold looking- BUT....slap some lattice work, or wooden slats on the exterior, and you're not only gaining a shading frame and surface around your little dwelling or shedworking office, but you're loosing the cold, hard, metal look that some don't prefer. If you were to grow grapes on this structure, even better! Food, shade, and beauty, all in one!   Back on \"hiding one's tiny house\", this approach might come in handy when you're trying to evade building inspectors, snooping neighbors, and those who might blow the whistle on your simple, little, unpermitted, hut- not that I....ahem....would recommend such an illegal course of action.... -Derek \"Deek\" Diedricksen"},

The name has as nice ring to it too....ALL of the windows we fitted for this were FREE- found, scavanged, and/or donated.      I might also add that this SOLD OUT workshop was an unbelievable amount of fun, and we worked on not one, but TWO tiny houses/cabins in the woods, where all involved got to not only help with building these structures, but helped DESIGN them- it was a pretty open canvas. Framing, roofing, post-hole digging and joist/floor frame setting, site selection, and beyond, we covered a very wide array of related subjects, both first hand and in our nighttime campfire discussions. We also took field trips to Mariah Coz's Comet Camper, Uncle Bob's Log Cabin (off-grid/solar), The Goodridge Lumber Mill (they're AMAZING!), The Pine Crest Tiny Cabins (www.pinecrestmotelandcabins.com), and also got to see (and some got to stay in) my stilt cabin, my U.B. 30 Treehouse, The Hickshaw micro-cabin, and more!The end of the camp weekend, we shot this photo. We got alot done, considering we were mostly working off-grid in the middle of nowhere, AND taking some field trips and hikes to other tiny houses sites, all in between.  Anyway, long story short, it was a blast, and a huge success, and we will have another- either in Vermont, and/or at Bill Rockhill's Bear Creek Carpentry HQ in the Adirondacks- soon enough. OUR NEXT WORKSHOP....I also plan on having another small workshop in MA (10 miles outside Boston) in the late fall, and for any interested, kidcedar at gmail dot com. I'll have more info soon enough. November 2nd weekend looks like our best bet- which'll mean nice, cool temperatures, thus warranting a bonfire at night for discussions.We'll have guest speakers, demos, actual building (a collaborative project), and then some....Me, on top of the roof, testing out the rafters, and adding some purlins.

I decided to give this solar light of theirs, the \"Sunnan\", a try, as I liked the look of it, and I'm a sucker for the color orange. This little light also comes in white, red, black, blue, yellow, and so on. With my \"Tiny House Summer Camp\" on the horizon in Vermont (no power out there) I thought it'd be neat to try out some new lighting products too- aside from the trusty old Coleman gas lanterns, which have served me well for almost twenty years (there's a link to those below too).     Well, overall, without getting technical, I had the chance to test it out quite a bit while camping in an off-grid tiny cabin in Massachusetts with my family the other week, and I have to say, all in all, I'm pretty pleased. Here's the thing though, and what you'll find when reading the reviews in the link below; The solar cell (which is removable), when plugged back in, has to be set just right, or the light won't turn on. It took me a few frustrating tries to plug and angle it in the proper way, but once I got the hang of it, I was pretty amazed at how bright the emitted light is, and it was easy to operate from there on out. So, the good: The light is easily bright enough to read by, and even to check for deer ticks by, which we used it for every night with our kids at the camp. The other plus is that for each light sold, Ikea ships one to a third world country so that students in homes without power will be able to read books and study at night. I like the idea. I also like the modern look and rugged build of this light, and the neck is flexible for ease-of-positioning as well, which comes in handy. The bad: On a full charge the light is only said to last 3 hours, and it takes 11 hours of very decent sun to fully charge this unit. That said, it seemed that I was getting a long run out of each charge, and only when charging it for 6-8 hours in passing sun, and again, the light given off is pretty bright for such a small lens/l..e.d. array.The cabin where my family stayed and where I tested out this light for a week.... All in all I'm pleased, but I just wish they built in a simple, recessed wall mount, as something like this would be perfect to wall hang, near a source of natural light, in a tiny house or cabin- a push-button wall light.Ikea sells these for about $20- online, they're more, but if there's no Ikea near you, there's little else you can do. Here's some links so you can check out more info, reviews, and all that....Also, plain ole kerosene/oil lanterns have always worked well for me too, they're easy to used, I love the old fashioned look of them, they're extremely affordable, and are built so simply, that little can usually go wrong with them. They do, however, no give off as much light as the Coleman gas lanterns (especially the dual mantle ones), or the Ikea Sunnan. On a full tank though, they do last a long time- up to eight hours in some cases.  -Derek \"Deek\" Diedricksen"},

We probably will add in a sleep loft, and even a tiny bathroom area, so as to make this more challenging, and fun, design wise!One/two spots open for the workshop, I believe.... then we close the sign-ups. kidcedar at gmail dot com-Derek \"Deek\" DiedricksenGot this photo in my inbox today, from Marty Skrelunas.

When I was a kid, my parents used to take me joy riding through this area on sundays after church, and I just loved the look of the houses, and the communal, fun, summer, vibe of this whole place. My own obsession with building kid's forts, and the gift of the book \"Tiny, Tiny Houses\" by Lester Walker, went on to solidify my early, and now, long-lasting, interest in tiny houses. I've been into it since I was ten years old, and built my first little cabin, with a bed, electricity, tv, hammock, and insulation, when I was 10 as well- influenced, no doubt, by Dud's Village (and its neighboring \"Young's Village\").Note: As this is a private drive/village, if you ever do visit, please be respectful. Walking this area's 5-6 streets is the best option, and the least obtrusive for its residents (the streets are tiny, and there is a 5 mph limit). I've yet to meet an unfriendly person here. Just don't walk around the place like a jerk, and thinkin' you own the joint, and you won't get any hassle.     I'd also park by Donahue's restaurant out front, and walk in from there. Across the street is the New England famous Fish Tale restaurant, and Nuzzo's Pizza right next store is great too. You're also directly next to (by means of a small hiking trail) Connecticut's largest state beach- Hammonasett State Park, or \"Hammo\", as we call it. Grand Apizza, in Clinton, CT is one of THE BEST pizza places I've been to, as well- definitely worth a stop. \"The Clam Castle\"- a Madison summer take-out fixture, is another spot to hit (walking distance from Dud's Village). I might release a fuller photo roll of this area soon as a guest post on tinyhouseblog.com Also, there are almost TWENTY tiny houses for sale in these neighborhoods right now- some might even be for rent, if you want to try them out. Overall, I'd imagine that this area holds over 100 small/tiny homes- easily.  MORE TO COME!"},

{"title": "Andrew Odom on Building The Base/Sub Floor for your tiny house on wheels/travel trailer home", "date": "Friday, May 25, 2012", "text": "Today, while I further prep things, plans, and gear for July's building workshop,\"Tiny House Summer Camp\" in Vermont, I hand things over the Andrew/Drew Odom of Tinyrevolution.us, all around good guy, and tiny house addict, and soon to be a tiny home dweller.  -Deek I asked Drew to talk about building the base/subfloor for one's travel trailer (there are many approaches, as we discuss in the Tumbleweed Tiny House Workshops I teach) and here's what he had to say...One of the most talked about subject in tiny house building is the subfloor.Like a number of subjects surrounding the building of a tiny house, there is no black or white; right or wrong. It truly is left up to the builder and his perceived version of what will work within his skillset (or pocketbook).Once a trailer has been chosen (as ours was sometime ago) it quickly becomes time to decide just how the house will stay attached. That, my friends, is where the subfloor comes in.Because we chose to use an EcoFoil radiant barrier we knew that would be one of our first steps. It wasn't THE first step though. We essentially ran a stringer down the center of the trailer in between each cross beam. This will serve as extra structural support as well as a way to hold in the insulation. Once we had the blanket of double bubble radiant barrier on the frame we added our floor joists. Each joist was constructed of 2\"x4\" lumber and held in place two ways.1) If the joist fell directly on a metal cross beam it was attached by a 4 1/2\" carriage bolt that is countersunk through the wood and then down through the metal, going through the EcoFoil and then tightened up by a washer and bolt.2) If the joist did not fall directly on a metal cross beam it was attached via joist hanger which was attached by nail to the perimeter framing.After our joists were in place and bolted down we then wrapped our remaining EcoFoil around the framing, stapled it into place, and prepared for the subfloor. Our subfloor is LP ProStruct Floor with SmartFinish - a durable overlay of beautiful, professional-grade substrate With no knots or voids. The subfloor is held into place by a bead of construction adhesive on all exposed joists and then 3 1/2\" framing nails around the top perimeter of the 4'x8' sheets of sub.Now that I read back over what we did I realize in words it isn't all that complicated. And I guess it wasn't. It is time consuming though and presents hours of questioning yourself, your skills, and the whole dern tiny house! But as I said earlier, there is probably as many ways to construct a tiny house floor \"sandwich\" as there are tiny houses. What it truly boils down to is being comfortable with your own finished product.If you want to see the visual of how we constructed our floor I invite you to watch our video here: http://youtube/9I--d6xB_IIWhile you're on YouTube feel free to subscribe to our channel!      Bigger does not always mean better.

I love the open feel, and height of this little home- although heating all that dead, lofty, space is a waste in the trade-off.  I've been doing a lot of brainstorming, planning, and sketching, in anticipation for \"Tiny House Summer Camp\" (July 6-9th), a four day tiny-house-building workshop that I'm hosting, and as a result, have been going back over many bookmarked photos I have harbored. The ones you see here are either shots of mine for the book \"Humble Homes, Simple Shacks\" (link is below), from www.tinyhouseswoon.com, or other various blog locales.     Each tiny house represented here, to me, offers something very appealing by way of spatial design, arrangement, and color. Three of the offerings are my own work/builds, and after wrestling back and forth with the idea, I went and included them- after all, they are exactly what I like in tiny decor, color, and layout. Great layering/leveling here, so as to maximize space for usage. This one almost has a stark, nautical feel, but still finds a way to come off as looking comfortable. (The Leaf House). Made from 95% junk- \"The Gypsy Junker\" micro-cabin that I built/designed. If you had to, it could sleep three- one up top, and two on the floor, in a mere \"shelter\" sense. I just love the natural light and colors that this little cabin always seems to capture. (Photo by Bruce Bettis). I've always wanted to make simple corrugated poly/plastic walls, and this photo is proof that this approach looks decent, works well, and would be very cost effective. The R value would SUCK though. This is from a series of photos that I took in Seattle, of Steve Sauer's Pico Dwelling- a 182 square foot apartment that utilizes living levels more than almost any tiny dwelling I've seen before. What a great guy Steve was, and I hope to include some photos of his place in my next book. Christopher Smith (Tiny: The Movie) is seen behind the camera, and this shoot will end up as a future edition of my show \"Tiny Yellow House\" on youtube. Another Seattle shot, and I figured we had to at least have one simple, yet cool looking, bathroom represented. This is a wet bath (shower stall with a toilet in it, more or less), with a homemade salad bowl sink, a \"VAN-ity\" mirror, and some funky tiling. Hal Colombo, of Freemont, WA is the mastermind behind this 68 square foot rentable dwelling. Check out airbnb.com. A GREAT, and very fun, host.  Nicolette Stewart from Germany furnished/built this little wagon dwelling for under $2000 USD (equivalent). The woman's got some style! I'm a big fan of shipping container homes, and this one's got such a great, open, and light, vibe. I really dig the wood paneling, and sink/cabinet set-up. What's not to like about this hippied-out, stained glass adorned, treehouse? Another one of my cabins \"The Boxy Lady\"- only 14 square feet, and designed as a sleepable kiosk for craft fairs, it gets much in the way of natural light, and yes, was built with free, discarded materials. Its a very fun, and cozy place to hang out with a book.  Graham Burnett from the UK built this one to serve as his backyard office/shed/guest hut. I really like its look of haphazardly placed windows- even more-so, recycled ones....Starting at age 22, I set upon building this cabin, in Vermont, with no plan, no electricity, and no running water to help me out. Its where we'll be holding (one of many cabins in the area) \"Tiny House Summer Camp\" in July (2012). I am a huge fan of natural wood, and this has lots of it!"},

A nearby field in the town the workshop will be held in, with a small mountain range in the background....Above- campfire at night outside of the log cabin. There is also a guest-sleeping treehouse on the premises, and my own Vermont cabin right nearby- walking distance...The ugly orange couch (free from an auto-body waiting room) mades its way to Vermont- We'll use this, among many other funky n' free, or re-purposed things, to furnish out the tiny cabin we'll be building. THIS FIELD, if you choose to tent-it, is the locale we'll be using as well (if you don't stay in the log cabin, my cabin, the hickshaw, or the treehouse). I additionally brought \"The Hickshaw\" micro-cabin/sleeper up to Vermont, where it will serve as a crash-space for one of our attendees....If interested in attending, email kidcedar at gmail dot com for information/to sign up.

While this could, or could not be, you primary source of (sunny day) showering and bathing, its a very simple option to at least consider (even for supplimental use), and one that is talked about as \"squeeze showers\" quite a bit in the \"Dwelling Portably\" books by Holly and Bert Davis- an outlandish, typewriter-written, journal-entry style, collection.    I plan to use one or two of these for weekending on my little houseboat/shantyboat project, when its completed and launched.  The Pros- (because there's always that large faction of people who will say/think \"That's ridiculous\"- before they ever (and will never) try it... -Simple, and you can set up as many of them as you please in a sunny spot. They are simply recycled plastic jugs spray painted with flat black paint (NOT glossy black- it reflects some of the sun back). -They're easy to control, work well (the water can get pretty hot- but not scalding hot). You can drill holes in the top too, so that when tipped, they flow more slowly. You'd be surprised at how little water you need to get clean- especially us Americans, who are used to 80 gallon-use showers. With a $1.00 can of cheap Home Depot spray paint (the no-name brand)- you could make about seven or eight of these.If placed in a sunny window, they can serve, tromb-wall/thermal mass-style, to retain a little solar heat/gain in your home after the sun has gone down- not much heat with small jugs, but with many of them, or a big barrel, it might make a noticeable difference.Great for on the go camping- as you travel, leave one or two in the back window of your car while on the road, or in your parked car. If your car is parked in the sun all the time at your tiny house site, just leave 'em in there to warm up full time. When stored (even just left outside) they don't take up much room at all. And when no longer in use, just recycle them.  The Cons-Its certainly different than a shower, you have a to conserve a little more, but once used to them, they work fine. They take getting some used to- you'll get the hang of it after 2/3 showers though. What people will say/think- but who the heck cares!? You shouldn't.The lack of control on the temperature of the water.Cloudy/cold days, you're out of luck.-----------------------My book has a few pages on solar gain, solar showers, and more....  -Derek \"Deek\" Diedricksen"},

Its a simple prototype (of an imagined real-deal, larger (adult-sized) cabin) that would be built on a very hefty steel pole, or enormous girder, cemented deep into the ground. Think: A much shorter cell phone tower pole, but with a tiny little house or office plopped on top of it.    I'm far from finished in these photos, and while I'm also working on that tiny, tiny houseboat/shantyboat still, this is something I wanted to finish, shoot, and get out of the way, for Make Magazine- a future show/episode of \"Tiny Yellow House\" while I have time.

So, plain and simple, here's a photo of one. While they may be a little hard to control in terms of precise temperatures, like cooking anything on a woodstove, they certainly stand as an affordable and space saving option for tiny houses, cabins, and well, any home in general.Woodstove dealers, and the Northern Tools catalogs often carry these.....Another option is a Coleman Camp Stove- which do prove reliable- you use them atop gas ranges- pretty simple stuff here. Obviously a Dutch Oven is another good option- you can bake cakes in 'em, biscuits...sky's the limit. Below is a link to some info on one of the better reviewed Dutch Oven's I've seen. There certainly are less expensive ones out there too, and you can keep an eye out for used ones as well- as these things, are fairly indestructible. Toaster Ovens, and 3-In-1 Breakfast Stations are also another avenue to pursue.   -Derek \"Deek\" Diedricksen"},

Owning a small utility trailer really pays for itself if you're planning on building a tiny house (or anything)- I've emphasized this over and over in my tiny house building workshops for Tumbleweed and for Relaxshacks.com. Not only will having a trailer at your disposal help with hauling the massive amount of materials and lumber you'll be needing (paying for itself right there by saving trips/gas), but these little trailers (mine is a 4' by 8') are so easy to lug, hook-up, and unhook, that in any curb-spotting situation, you can quickly grab your trailer, and head back to wherever you need to go (for windows, doors, and more).Small trailers like this can be towed by cars or mini-vans too. You don't need a 3 mpg monster truck for these tasks.      Anyway, I found this old school waiting room couch the other day, and it was offered up to me simply because I asked (at a gas station that was changing owners). It was stored outside in an area where I wasn't quite sure if they were saving, or chucking, it, so the moral of the story is, \"don't be afraid to ask\". The worst they can say is \"no\", or \"get the hell off my property\"- which I haven't heard yet.     I'll either sell this couch for materials money, or lug it up to Vermont, where I need an ugly funky couch for my cabin, or for the new tiny house/cabin that we'll all be building together at the July 6-9th, Tiny House Summer Camp in Vermont. I can't wait! Benefits of a small trailer....-Affordable-Lightweight-Easy to hitch and move-It'll be used for more things than you'll ever suspect-It can be towed with a small/normal sized vehicle with a hitch installation (about $250)-It can become a money earner if you advertise yourself on craigslist as \"guy/gal with a trailer for hire\" -Great for dump runs-Even better for finding large freebies, lumber, and whatever else you might come across, or want to buy. The Downside of owning a trailer...-Having to buy it (again, they're pretty affordable though- $300-$1000)-Registration/tax on it (mine is about $20 a year)-Storing it when not in use-Friends left and right will ask you for favors (wanting you to help them move..)-Occasional repairs (I had to replace the leaf springs on mine a ways back- $200)-Derek \"Deek\" Diedricksen"},

I'm Mariah: builder, maker, do-it-your-selfer, designer, tiny house  and vintage trailer enthusiast, and student studying mobile and  alternative dwellings (I design my own curriculum and major at school). I  am building The COMET (Cost-Efficient,  Off-grid, Mobile Eco-Trailer) as a response to the combination of  dwindling resources on our planet and, ironically, the incredible amount  of waste and excess that makes it's way into the dumpster and the  landfill every day. The plan is to turn this 1960's Avalon travel  trailer into an off-the-grid, self-sufficient, mobile tiny house that  has virtually no impact on the environment and a big social impact by  serving as a mobile green classroom. Using mainly re-used, free, and  repurposed/recycled materials, and sustainably produced products where  necessary, The COMET aims to empower, educate,  and inspire people to live TINY, SUSTAINABLY, FLEXIBLY, AFFORDABLY and  HEALTHY. In less than 112 square feet I will have 555 Watts of solar  power, a self-contained rainwater harvesting/filtration system, a  waterless composting toilet, solar shower, bumper garden, and most  importantly, a HOME (all for under $8000!).      I encourage people to follow the COMET and it's progress at www.cometcamper.wordpress.com,  as the website itself is meant to be a resource and tool for other  DIYers who want to explore sustainable, tiny living. There will be  tutorials and how-to's aimed at empowering others to build their own  composting toilet, solar power system, and build with re-purposed  materials. My background in vintage trailer restoration and love for the  Tiny House movement have brought me to this project.  When The COMET  is done, we'll hit the road, stopping all over the US doing open  houses, tours, info sessions, and workshops. My hope is that people who  see and experience The COMET will be inspired and empowered to live tiny and more sustainably.I'm REALLY excited to be bringing The COMET to Deek's \"Tiny House Summer Camp\" workshop this summer too. I'll be showing you the camper  itself and some really neat new stuff in sustainable building  techniques, showing off my free and recycled finds that will be going  into The COMET, explaining why vintage campers  make great tiny houses,  talking about how to save $$ in your tiny house  by having an entirely DC photovoltaic solar electric system like The COMET, and more!

SO MANY PEOPLE ask me, whether its by email, at the workshops I've hosted, or in our discussion groups \"But Deek, how do we go about saving for our tiny house when we're stuck in a debt trap in the meantime?\". Well....here's some of MANY approaches you might be able to employ....  SAVE OVER $10,000 IN ONE YEAR!  ENOUGH TO BUILD YOURSELF A SWEET MICRO-CABIN! A dollar saved is a (tax-FREE) dollar earned! Want to build yourself a cabin but don't have the money saved to make it happen!?  Here are some easy, environmentally friendly, ways to save over $10,000 in just one year! SAVE $256 ON PAPER PRODUCTS!Use cloth napkins and save $156 a year.  PLUS save an additional $100 each year by using bar rags instead of paper towels (I save my paper towels for the really disgusting tasks!)- this is factoring in washing, etc. SAVE $1,200 EACH YEAR ON LUNCH!Bring leftovers to work for lunch and save a minimum of $1,200 a year.  And that's assuming your buying a low end fast-food lunch. SAVE $1,000 - $1,800 EACH YEAR ON SNACKS!Replace junkie snacks bought out of desperation with cut up veggies and save up to $1,800 a year.  Less junk, more fresh stuff!  SAVE $1000 A YEAR!Drink filtered water and save $1,000 a year.  Why drink water out of a one time use plastic bottle?  The plastic breaks down … leaving you to ingest harmful chemicals.  I boil my tap water and add a couple of slices of fresh ginger to it.  Gives my water a fresh zing.  You could also add lemon or lime to it!              (Deek: Also check out the book \"Bottlemania\"- which shows just how dishonest and unenvironmental most of these bottled water companies are. I try to never buy/drink bottled water- far too many negatives behind it).   SAVE AT LEAST $120 EACH YEAR COURTESY OF THE PUBLIC LIBRARY!Make it a no-buy year.  Books, magazines and CD's.  Instead get them from your library for FREE!  Even if you only buy 1 book a month at $10.  That's another $120 dollars saved!CABLE ROTS THE BRAIN AND YOUR WALLET! SAVE $840 EACH YEAR!Let the cable company keep their commercials!  Most of my favorite shows are now offered online for FREE and with less commercials!  Save up to $70 a month!  I shut mine off on New Years day.  And I have already saved nearly $300!  BONUS!  I've spent hours upon hours of my life doing far more important things!SIMPLY UNPLUG UNUSED APPLIANCES! SAVE $60-$120 EACH YEAR.Save anywhere from 5%-10% off of your electrical bill each year simply by unplugging appliances while not in use!  Consider unplugging your; desktop and laptop computers, TV, DVD player, stereo, radios, coffeemaker, lamps, toasters, phone charger when not in use, microwave.  And whenever possible unplug your washer and dryer.SAVE ANOTHER $50 A YEAR!By simply shutting your closet doors, you will reduce the amount of heat/air conditioning your household uses.  (Deek: Or simply air condition only one centrally used room during the day, and save even more!) HANG DRY AND SAVE $104-$350 EACH YEAR!It's starting to warm up!  Why not let the sun do what it does best and dry your clothes!  Or try this cool trick … I made hang drying easy on myself by installing a clothes rod hanger above my washing machine.  I simply hang my clothes on the hangers and hang them up.  Then I put them away when they are dry!  No folding, no ironing (which saves a little additional electricity + your precious time!). Simply hang dry your clothes and save just over a $1 a load.  You can multiply that $1 by how many loads you do a year and bank the savings!   BONUS: Hang up your towel in between uses.  When you use a clean towel to dry your clean body off after showering...the towel is still clean.  It's just damp.  You can use it for a solid week before it needs to be washed!  Don't hang it on a peg...that does not help it stay fresh.  It needs to be completely aired out, over a towel bar.  When possible hang it outside.  You will save time, water and energy.TAKE A RIDE! AND SAVE $6000 A YEAR!Take the bus, ride your bike (most buses have easy to use bike racks).  This may not always be practical depending on where you live.  But most cities are set up with convenient mass-transportation.  When my car broke down a couple of years ago, I started taking the bus, the train (I've made some great friends on the train, caught up on work etc.) and have saved myself at least $500 a month.  When you account for gas, insurance, car payments, registration fees...in all likelihood it's far more than that.IF YOUR A TEA DRINKER! SAVE $104-$730 EACH YEAR!$104-(for tea out of the tin) or $730 if your buying cans/big gulps.    Instead of buying overly sweetened tea out of a can or a big gulp of overly sweetened tea at some fast food place … or even pricey cardboard boxes or tins with 20 or so  tea-bags inside for $3-$5 ...  You can easily grow your own tea herbs / and use fresh ginger to make tea.  That is something I just started to do.  And the quality is so much better.  Get yourself a cool metal tea ball, stuff it with fresh mint and your good to go!  BONUS: Save money on allergy medicine!  Use a little of your savings to buy organic, locally sourced honey.  It will help reduce any allergies you may have!COFFEE DRINKERS - SAVE $700!Brew your own coffee at home and save $700 per person a year. SAVE ANOTHER $3000 EACH YEAR ON FOOD!Buy or download a copy of one of my books!  “Feed Your Family on $25 A Week! (no coupons)!”  And/or  “Gluten-Free on $5 A Day!”  Both books are packed with easy-healthy recipes, menus, shopping lists and more.  Everything you need to get healthy while saving money on food!

In stark contrast  is builder Joel Allen's  egg-shaped treehouse suspended above a hemlock tree. A former software  engineer, Allen designed this modest 200-square foot retreat to include  loft sleeping quarters, an outdoor deck (with views of the snow-capped  Tantalus range), and a work area tucked behind the stairs. Over the  course of four summers, Allen built his getaway using $10,000 worth of  castaway items collected via Craigslist. “People thought I had gone a  little bit mad,” says Allen. “I was compulsively refreshing Craigslist  every two minutes waiting for that next item to come up and grab it  before anyone else.

This hotel (which gets more day time tourists than overnight guests) has become quite the popular photo spot in Da Nat, and was built while the local government turned their backs to the work in progress (Nga is the daughter of the ex-president of Vietnam, and was thereby given free reign to build, in what is otherwise a very strict, and traditionally communist, country)- Preferential treatment because of political ties!?

ANYWAY..... since many of you know I love scavenging for materials, here's a solid idea from one of our blog readers.....Hey Deek,Bought your book, follow your blog, always accumulating stacks of rescued  boards and lumber in the back yard for projects.A great place to dumpster dive: boatyards, especially now when guys are  taking off the winter covers and getting ready to put the boats in the  water.  Stuff I have actually found in boatyard dumpsters:* Lots of 1x2 lath (used as supports for winter covers).... I built a tree  house out of this stuff, and an arbor for my back deck.* Plastic shrink wrap material ... a substitute for Tyvek?* Copper wire* left over, partially empty cans of paint* various boat fittings (hinges, latches, other nice chrome plated bronze  thingies)* quality lumber, especially teak, oak and mahogany.  I just finished  building a really nice sofa table out of thrown out oak lumber and the top is a  couple of mahogany boards that were the back seat of an outboard boat. Little  useless chunks of oak board make my Sunday barbeque smell like a fancy Italian  restaurant.* electronics (marine radios, cd players, speakers etc.) Some broken, some  not.* other scrap metal- sold by weight * rope, cord, fishing line* many unused first aid kits * And tons of recyclable bottles and cans = $$$ (a couple of hours netted me over $30 in beverage units- all while I was looking for other stuff in the meantime). My goal with some of this material is to build a tree fort so that I have a small sanctuary to sit and read and  nap, and when the grandkids come over, they think it's their treefort to play in  (so it gets by under the wife's radar!).  Plus, 100% all scavenged  materials, including the screws and nails. The door hinges came off of a  foldable boat captain's chair I pulled out of the boatyard dumpster. The roof is  going to be a sheet of clear corrugated plastic material my son pulled out his  work dumpster at Hart Supply in Hingham (they deal in all kinds of plexi  products.... I love their stuff called containment-grade-polycarbonate...what  they make the jail cells at Gitmo out of these days.) I'll send you pics when it's up against the tree and operational.Ps... Thanks for the tip about the Stanley Fat Max hand saw a while ago.  Last month, Lowe's had them on sale in the discontinued section for $8.   This tool is way sharp and crosscuts faster and easier than any electric saw  I have ever had.Mike from North Weymouth, MA   Derek      \"Deek\" Diedricksen runs the blog Relaxshacks.com, Hosts \"Tiny  Yellow     House\" TV on youtube, and is author of the tiny house, fort,  cabin,     treehouse, and cottage design book \"Humble Homes, Simple  Shacks\"  which    you can check out by clicking HERE."},

Having used found windows in well over a dozen cabin and shelter projects I've personally built, believe me, the savings is HUGE. I'm currently using some in a tiny houseboat/shantyboat project of mine in fact....     These are the kind of things I'll be talking about in a new workshop segment \"How to save THOUSANDS while building your own Tumbleweed or Tiny House\".

L.A. Davis from MGN SOLAR www.mgnsolar.com will be there to talk about his solar energy knowledge, and how his work and ideas especially caters to tiny homes. I'll  also be introducing a few new segments to the Tumbleweed workshop scene  with talks on utilizing (how, when, and where) recycled and repurposed  materials in your home build, a critique/showcase session with a slide  show of a wild array of tiny homes, shelters, and cabins, AND a session on \"Tricks Of The Trade\"- time, body, and mind saving techniques and tips that I've acquired in over 20 years of building.I'll also later juggle bowling pins set afire!

What a gathering! Even the mere exchange of ideas with so many likeminded people on coffee breaks was incentive enough to attend this.Many of these people I had communicated with online before, but had never had a chance to hang with, or have lengthy conversations with, and the experience was just inspiring, fun, and enlightening. Jay Shafer at one point said to me \"Ya know, I don't think there's ever been a tiny house gathering of this many builders, teachers, and bloggers all in one place before.\". I think he might have been right, and I just wish I could have gotten a photo with ALL of them in it.

From tiny house-related jaunts to Walden Woods, The Catskills, Brooklyn NY, Franconia Notch in NH, Seattle, Maine, Martha's Vineyard, Vermont, Boston, and my own backyard, tonight's photo search (for one shot not in this post), made me realize yet another way in which owning a smaller and more affordable home has benefited me; I have the free time to not only see these things, but to sit back, take it all in, and enjoy what I see.  Its funny, us tiny house addicts (Kent Griswold, Tammy Strobel, Michael Janzen, Jay Shafer, etc) seem to LOVE photography. One or two of these photos, such as the one directly above, are from my \"Humble Homes, Simple Shacks\" book, but most were just deviations and distractions, things I wanted to capture just for the heck of it.

It, with some of my other cabins, tiny houses, shed work, and forts, has been in the NY Times, Seattle Times, Boston Glove, PBS, NPR, ABC, CBS, and so on...RIGHT NOW, its on display at the Easton Library in Massachusetts, and it'll be there until I do a book speaking session/signing for \"Humble Homes, Simple Shacks\" THIS Thursday (tomorrow)- 6:30 pm- FREE to all.

Sadly, the boat wasn't right for what I want to do, so the search continues....As small as this project is, it ISN'T, as the costs on any of these builds, even with a ton of recycled materials add up REAL quickly. This one would later require a boating license, an outboard motor, trailer, and so on.... YES, I will shoot a tour/how-to video of it down the road, if I ever make it that far. I'm also torn between starting this project, or one on a more sizeable house on wheels at some point- we'll see....SO....for that reason, THE HICKSHAW, to anyone who might ever be interested, is for sale- $800- all of which will go towards this micro-mini houseboat or the other project (and eventual videos).

Kinda creepy though, these hulking, abandoned wrecks...Literally, these are forts (military ones) on piers/legs.WHAT THE HECK ARE THESE!? The Thames Estuary Army Forts were constructed in 1942 to a design by Guy Maunsell, following the successful construction and deployment of the Naval Sea Forts. Their purpose was to provide anti-aircraft fire within the Thames Estuary area. Each fort consisted of a group of seven towers with a walkway connecting them all to the central control tower. The fort, when viewed as a whole, comprised one Bofors tower, a control tower, four gun towers and a searchlight tower. They were arranged in a very specific way, with the control tower at the centre, the Bofors and gun towers arranged in a semi-circular fashion around it and the searchlight tower positioned further away, but still linked directly to the control tower via a walkway.

For the time being, I just wanted to show you a rather cool, free, adjustable, mirror, compact in size, that might be perfect for the bathroom, or wet bath in the tiny house that you might be planning on building. Yes, its a Van's side-view mirror (A VANity mirror, as Hal dubbed it). I spent the night in Hal C's 68 square foot guest house in Fremont (part of Seattle), and the place was just LOADED with some fun and unique ideas. Wait til' I show you the photos on his other secret-passage bathroom down the road.With a cement floor, a central drain, and a completely tiled wall, this wet bath works very well.  You can spend the night in Hal's place (REAL affordable- $70 a night I believe) by contacting him at tinyguesthouse@gmail.com And AGAIN, LOTS of photos on the way from this trip, where I guest spoke at the Tumbleweed Tiny House Co's well attended workshop. This trip doubled as a photo shoot for one of my upcoming books. To see some of my other tiny house travel photos and work, LOTS of its in the new \"Humble Homes, Simple Shacks\" book.

Imagine how many people we could possibly reach.....I'm not reinventing any wheel here- I'm just trying to help get more going in a positive direction...and to get people to THINK before they purchase anything. Who made it? Where did it come from? Who is supported by this sale? Painting by Karl Mullen- Williamstown, MAI'm already thinking....a local bakery I haven't been to in a little bit, an etsy artist or two, a new local artist studio/gallery that I've been meaning to check out, maybe hit a farmers market, a local, struggling, mom n' pop convenience store down the street, a Lions Club-run flea market building in town......

What I like most about this is something I've sketched into a few past designs for a trailer-type homes I'd someday like to build; This vardo/caravan has made use of the tongue of the trailer as a front entrance deck. I don't know why more people don't do this- it makes good sense, and adds minimal weight to the overall structure. Its \"dang\" simple to build too... This one's over on Tinyhouselistings.com  $6000 is the asking price (located in New Jersey) Here's the info from the sales listing..... This is my 2nd little gypsy caravan Ive built for camping.  Its made out of MDO Epoxy encased plywood with solid foam insulation  in the walls.  The interior height is 54″,  outside width is 6″4″,  interior width of 5’11″, and 10 feet long.  The box on the back is  designed to be the galley area, the 5000 btu air conditioner is built in, but could be removed.  The bed is full sized futon (54″) with a memmory foam topper.  It can be closed up to couch sized, or pulled out for a full sized bed.  The propane heater  keeps it comfy warm in 16′ temps with it barely on above a pilot light.   Easily removed for the summer time.  The front deck is red cedar.  Its  solidly constructed with a heavy gauge rubber roof thats rated for 20  years!   It is equipped with a 12 volt deep cycle battery and also wired  for ac power.Easily sleeps 2 adults, with floor space for children.  There is storage space under the bed for clothes etc.I took it on a 500 mile shake down cruise and it tows nice and straight behind my truck.  Tow weight as equipped was 1650lbs.(bedding not included)If you like gypsy wagons, caravans, and vardos, two of my favorites come from...HORNBY ISLAND CARAVANS(Michelle Wilson and Co.) andGEORGE CRAWFORD of PALEOTOOLSBoth of these builders are photographically featured in my new \"Humble Homes, Simple Shacks\" book- which has been #1 on Amazon in the carpentry section for almost 4 weeks running!

Here's the same exact concept, but showing that you can very simply enlarge the idea and make it much more so an adult cabin- a very affordable, easy to build one too!-Derek \"Deek\" Diedricksen  MANY MORE IDEAS and SKETCHES COMING SOON! WHAT ABOUT OTHER USES FOR OLD TIRES?In Anytown, USA (or worldwide) you'll find more free tires than you'll know what to do with. Just ask any autobody or tire place- they'll be THRILLED to give them to you as they have to PAY for their disposal in most cases.      Yes, most have seen the famous \"Earthships\" in Taos, New Mexico that Michael Reynolds has developed and messed with for decades (a smaller version is in the first two shots below), but what about OTHER USES FOR OLD TIRES??? (\"Garbage Warrior\", The Earthship Documentary is great if you haven't seen it before- I linked it below).      Anyway, check some of these ideas out, and if YOU have any, please add them to the comments below! WHAT WOULD YOU DO? THE SUPPLY IS ALMOST ENDLESS- AND FREE! Again, one of my ideas for small shelters, tiny homes, and structures in general, is to use tires as a floating pad of sorts, as a support platform (when placed at corners or strategically underneath). Once compressed under the weight of the cabin, these won't shift much, if at all. Another idea involved concrete-filled, pre-bolt-inserted tires as attachment points for swamp-land walkways. I even briefly talk about stacked-tire stairways....a link for the NEW \"Humble Homes, Simple Shacks\" is right below.... only $11.53 with free shipping in some cases.

In the meantime, if YOU have some interesting ideas for  reusing old tires, please share below.Example: One idea from \"Humble Homes, Simple Shacks\" is a footbridge (for swampy and marshy locales). where the bases of the plank walks are made from concrete-filled, bolt-inserted, tires. Stack them to the height you need, roll them into place, and bolt the planks as you go along.....We had another example or two in the OLD version of the book, and a sketch that didn't make the cut for the expanded version.

{"title": "A spin on the \"Little Blue Bump Shelter/Cabin\" from Curt Lyons", "date": "Tuesday, February 7, 2012", "text": "A ways back, at last years Relaxshacks.com tiny house/shelter workshop here in Massachusetts we started work on two prototype structures, one which I later finished, painted, and self-filmed a video of (below). This little prototype for an ultra-simple cabin (which could be built as a much larger version) was something I dubbed \"The Little Blue Bump\". I no longer own this cabin- sold it to build another concept from my \"Humble Homes\" book- but its surprised me in how many people took a shinin' to the idea and approach. Its a cabin closely related to another I built (photos are in the new book) called \"The GottaGiddaWay\"- which, in an NY Times interview, while on the spot, I originally named \"The Hundred Dollar Homeless Hut\". Honestly, nothing is more flattering and makes me happier than to have someone send me photos, video, or an email about a project they took on that was inspired by one in my book, or in one of my videos....Here's a recent one...  -----------------------Hey Deek,        I have attached some photos of a playhouse I made for my daughter based on  your hundred dollar homeless hut. I found the base in a giant mulch  pile, it must have been part of a plywood shipping box for something  big. I just had to flip the boards attached from horizontal to vertical  for strength. It is around 6' by almost 4'. My daughter wanted a hobbit  door, so I used faux board and batten and glued it to the cut out of the  entrance.

{"title": "An Interview with The Wooden Wonders Crew (Homemade Tiny Hobbit Houses)", "date": "Sunday, February 5, 2012", "text": "I can't find any true interviews with the Wooden Wonders folks (criminally so), aside from some shorter newspaper pieces, so I thought this might make for an interesting tiny house topic/interview....I guess, the \"first\" longer interview with 'em. I can guarantee you'll be hearing more from these people down the road- good folks, with a good idea. I also plan on heading out to shoot a tour of their models at some point for \"Tiny Yellow House\" on youtube (www.youtube.com/relaxshacksDOTcom) -DeekAnd yup. we have a domed, ferro-cement, secret-passage, hobbit-cave design in the new version of my book \"Humble Homes, Simple Shacks\"- order it wayyy below...-----------------------------------------------     When I first caught a glimpse of the Wooden Wonders \"Hobbit Houses\" (built right in the Bangor, Maine area), I thought to myself \"Wow, fun looking AND functional\" (or as I like to say \"FUNKtional\"). It always surprises me that the two don't seem to co-exist more often in the world of tiny houses. Granted, there ARE many adventurous, colorful, daring, and aesthetically appealing homes and models out there, from the just-plain-gorgeous Zyl vardos, to the elegant class of the Shafer Tumbleweeds, but with a mix of simplicity, and childhood whimsy, while still fitting in useability, these \"hobbit holes\" from Wooden Wonders score big points on my personal radar. Let's face it, I'm also a sucker for sculptural and artistic dwellings, so I couldn't resist a chance to exchange words with Melissa Pillsbury over at the WWHQ....      www.wooden-wonders.com to check their prices....----------------------------------------------------------- DEEK: Alright, I can assume there's a strong influence from J.R.R. Tolkien's work, but what drew you to build and dabble/enter the shedworking/hut business? And what about some of your other inspirations, or your quick backstory?MELISSA: Rocy  had been doing traditional carpentry for over 15 years and he was ready  for a change.  He was not only bored with the work, but we also have a  young family (two sons:  Richard, 3 and Maxximus, 1), so we wanted to  build  a home-based business rather than a job-site based business. He's a  really creative guy and a big fan of fantasy, so it was a natural fit  for him to apply his mastery of carpentry to more creative and whimsical  structures.  Hobbit Holes are just one of many fantastical structure  concepts brewing in Rocy's mind, but once we built the Hobbit Hole  prototype, the idea started to gain traction and we've built the product  line from there.DEEK: Now, the very first \"Hobbit Hole\" you built- how long ago was this, and has the design changed much over time for you? What different models do you offer too?MELISSA: We  brought the \"original\" Hobbit Hole to the 2009 Common Ground Country  Fair, which is a big three day \"country fair\" that takes place right in  our home town of Unity, Maine every September.  It was a playhouse  Hobbit Hole model and we also brought a play-castle/tower prototype.   Our booth was absolutely swarmed with children all weekend,  so it was clear that both products were a hit with the kids.   But we  noticed an important distinction in the reactions of the adults between  the two products.  They barely gave the castle a second glance, but they  were very interested in the Hobbit Hole and stood there trying to come  up with other uses for one.  This told us two things.  First, we knew we  had a winner with the Hobbit Hole concept. Second, we knew we had  better come up with more variations on the theme because our potential  market for them went far beyond parents and grandparents in the market  for a playhouse.  Thus our Hobbit Hole product line was born.       We're  always improving and refining the designs, and developing new ones.   Some new concepts make it to the end, and others flop.  Last winter we  developed a line of doghouses, but we weren't happy with the finished  product, so we dropped it.       We currently have five distinct product  lines, each of which come in multiple sizes and with many customizable  options:  playhouses, chicken coops, sheds, cottages and saunas.  We  also have a Hobbit Hole kit product line in development, which is  particularly exciting because it will really broaden our reach.  The  products in our current lines are delivered fully built and finished.   While this allows us to have a highly customizable product, it also  means there's a limit to how far we can sell them before the cost of  delivery becomes prohibitively expensive.  The kit options we're working  on will give folks outside New England an opportunity to purchase a  reasonably priced Wooden Wonders Hobbit Hole.DEEK: In most cases, what do you find people people purchasing these for? I see a wide range of possibilities, but what do you find most commonly?MELISSA: It  really runs the full range of what we offer.  We've developed our  products based on what people have told us  they want, and we can always do a custom job to fit a customer's  needs.   Cottages and playhouses are our two most popular products, and the  cottages people buy are used for most anything:  a seasonal guest room,  camp, office, studio... The sauna is our newest product, so we haven't  done as many of those.  We also just launched the chicken coops last  fall, so we haven't done too many of those yet, either, but I think  they're going to be popular.DEEK: Could you give us a brief description on the overview and facets/features of these? Better yet- the building process?MELISSA: The  most notable features, and what makes them \"Hobbit Holes\" are the  curved walls which form the dome shaped face and the round front door.   We make each curved rafter by hand by laminating several layers of cedar  and bending them on a hydraulic glue press.  It's a fairly labor and  time consuming process compared to using dimensional framing lumber, but  it's also what allows us to build products that really set us apart  from anything else  that's  out there in the marketplace.       The round front doors also come with  their challenges.  It took us a while to find hinges that met our  quality and durability standards and also looked nice.  And the bigger  the door, the trickier it is to engineer the hinge so you still have a  properly functioning front door.DEEK: I see that one of your models has a spin on the \"living roof\" approach- somewhat of a green roof meets flower boxes- what's the methodology there to ensure you're not prematurely attracting rot andleaks to your roof.MELISSA: We  offer planters as an option on our Hobbit Holes as well as full or  partial  in-ground installation of the structure  (making it a \"true\" Hobbit Hole).  As any builder can appreciate,  there's quite a bit that goes into making a living roof work.  When  building a structures with any of these \"living roof\" applications, the  roof is first sheathed in v-match cedar, then over that is a continuous  layer of high quality self-adhesive under-roofing (ice & water  shield).  On top of that is a layer of pressure treated strapping to  create a drainage plane and air space, and on top of that there's  another layer of ice & water shield for attachment points.  On top  of that there's a layer of plywood rated for in-ground contact, then  multiple layers of landscape fabric  The planters are all cedar and the  fasteners are all stainless steel.  We rate the life expectancy of the  planters at 15 to 25 years.  To further combat potential moisture  problems, we use all cedar framing and the interior finish walls are  also cedar.  Our Hobbit Holes  are no joke :)DEEK: Wow, more involved, and more layering than I would have expected....Messing with any new designs/variations on the horizon?MELISSA: We're  pretty excited about our upcoming line of Hobbit Hole kits.  The  designs we're working on will  incorporate more of the living roof look that you might typically  associate with a Hobbit Hole.  They're going to be dang cute and I think  it will be an appealing combined carpentry and landscaping project for  the DIYers out there (or you can hire someone to do the work for you).   Your readers will have to follow us on facebook to find out when we have  them ready to sell (facebook.com/HobbitHoles).  We're hoping to roll them out sometime in 2012.DEEK: Any bizarre or custom request stories?  purposes....MELISSA: Well, we've talked to all kinds of people  about all kinds of ideas....  By far the nicest structure we've built  was a custom two-room cottage that was bigger than any of the standard  cottage sizes we offered at the time (that size has since been added to  our list of standard size options for Hobbit Hole Cottages).  By \"tiny  house\" standards it's definitely big enough to live in (just over 150 sq  ft) and the second room in this particular one is a screened porch, but  if I were going to live in it, I think I'd opt to use that space for a  bathroom...DEEK: Before I let you go- Your show room up in Unity Maine, can anyone just stop by and poke through these  things?MELISSA: We've got Hobbit Holes on display all over the  place in central/midcoast Maine at the moment-- next to Unity Pond  Pottery in Unity, in front of Stephen King's Zone Radio stations on  Broadway in Bangor, next to the Maine Coast Welcome Center on Rt. 1 in  Belfast and at Plants Unlimited on Rt. 1 in Rockport.  Folks are  definitely encouraged to stop and take a look.  We'll even meet you  there if you give us a few minutes notice.People might also want to know that we have some of last year's inventory on sale (www.hobbitholes.etsy.com)  and we can offer a 10% discount on any custom orders placed by March  1st.  Just tell us Deek sent you!  \"Like\" us on facebook:  www.facebook.com/HobbitHoles, bookmark our web page:  www.wooden-wonders.com, and come visit!(The site is certainly worth a look- some really fun, eye-candy, for all you tiny house addicts).-Derek \"Deek\" DiedricksenHere's a very bizarre one for you tiny house lovers out there- one I had fun schemin' n' sketching- and yes, its part of \"SIXTY SHACK SKETCHES IN SIXTY DAYS\" (#44). I'm picking up where I left off, as I've been sick for close to a week and just haven't had it in me to get much done. These sketches were a series leading up to the release of the NEW \"Humble Homes, Simple Shacks\"- which is already out at this point- but, I'm going to complete the full sixty anyway. Again, thanks to anyone who has supported me and this site by ordering a copy of the book- only $11.53 w/a free shipping option. Thanks!The core of this could very easily be used for a guest house or a tiny home, even at a mere 10' by 10'. It would have a sleep space (a 5' by 7' bunk/loft), a simple kitchenette in one corner, and a small boating-toilet area could be added beneath some of the bunk (only taking up a portion of it), or could be added as a bump-out on the back end of the structure. The shower, at least initially, could be a simple outdoor, propane-heated unit.  This particular design/concept is from a version of \"Quick Camps And Leg Cramps\"- an old micro-zine/mini-book I had out in a very, very limited quantity a long ways back- we'll eventually get more printed."},

Anyway, with time at a premium, I often find myself in a hurry, as I lose daylight, to run my materials into my storage shed, knowing I'll merely pull them out again the very next morning. So why bother organizing them? Well, for one, over time, certain items, materials, and tools start accumulation in \"said shed\", and next thing I know, I'm left with the monumental task of cleaning it all up again.So, to give myself a motivating kick in the ass, I've held back in no way with this photo, to show you how awful my shed has gotten.  THE PLAN: And its gonna take time...Rehab this whole self-built outbuilding and transform it into a \"ROCK SHED\"- a space where I can work, play instruments/jam with friends, shoot vlog episodes for this blog, and STILL store things.....and I'll certainly show you the results, and things I learn, along the way.     I already have a vision of what I want this place to look like, and if it comes out anything like I've imagined, I'll be very pleased. Time will tell. This project has already begun, and the shed looks entirely different at this point- MUCH LESS STUFF. I've sold some of it on craigslist, donated other items, and left the rest on my curb for others to take (EVERY item except one was picked up by other scavengers- bless 'em, one n' all!).There have also been many \"Wow, I didn't know I owned that!\", or \"I've been looking for that!\" moments....File Under: Sheds/Shed into a tiny work/guest house, small homes, forts, shacks, shedworking, micro houses"},

I have quite a few backlogged videos now, and its tough to find the time, and funds, editors (in other cases), and the proper equipment, to complete these.

What's cool about his little \"inverted, boat-looking, roof/cap\" is that with its addition of a tiny sleep compartment, or shelf, in the summer (or in more temporate climates) this would make for a great little camping vehicle. You could just drop some mosquito netting, and you're G.T.G. (\"Good to go\"- sorry, its a stupid, made-up, saying I use all the time).This truck would also be GREAT for tailgating- just set up the bed as you would a deck- table, chairs, a grill (if you had a means to open the roof), and you've got yourself a porch on wheels, WITH a nap spot. Or, if you need to crash where sleeping in your truck isn't so legal, you're really perched out of site up in the eaves of this little turtle-backed rig, so chances are no one would ever see you (or be able to steal gear from the back of your truck! Imagine the scare you'd give 'em!). There's actually a design/concept in \"Humble Homes, Simple Shacks\" that has the same premise- hidden sleeping quarters. Its called \"The Thwart Fort\"- a picnic gazebo, in which the filled in roof, plays home to a tiny, clandestine, sleeping or living spot. -Derek \"Deek\" Diedricksen"},

Pretty darn impressive. Certainly not a tiny house or cabin- but the possibilities in terms of treehouse, or free-floating loft, construction are obvious here. This exhibit, in which kids can climb over three stories high, is a simple combination of steel cables (netting-style), and inch thick, steam-shaped/bent plywood panels.      Look closely and you'll see kids climbing all over this thing.

{"title": "Eli Curtis' Tiny Cabin On Wheels- A micro getaway shack and workshop...", "date": "Thursday, January 26, 2012", "text": "I  came across Eli Curtis' photos of his tiny little cabin/sleep shack on  wheels a little ways back and invited him to tell its tale. Some of you  may have see one of two shots of his latest project, as Eli is a member  of our \"Tiny Yellow House and Relaxshacks.com\" tiny housing discussion  group on facebook. Anyway, here, in Eli's words, is the back story on  this cool little mobile house....This  micro cabin build just happened at the drop of a hat almost. I had  purchased this heavy duty 5x10 trailer and took it with me to a barn  restoration/addition job and parked it in the barn so that I could work on it when it  was too wet out to set poles. My plan was to construct a cargo style  builder-trailer with some reclaimed industrial metal building panels, but  when I got the trailer painted and re-decked I decided that it would  get used more if I left it flat.      I   had been working on a few cedar cabin kits, that I eventually wanted to   get some plans together for and sell, but this at  the time was just  one of many back burner projects I had going on. One    day when I went to pick up some cedar from a local mill I had a   conversation about barns,cabins and just wood in general with the  owner. He told me  that if I just had a  place to put a demo building I could probably get  some people interested in these kits. He also offered to donate all the  lumber to  build one! Well, in less time than it took me to get down the road, I  decided that I was going to  build a cabin on wheels! Three days  later I picked up my package of materials with my flat  deck trailer and set upon building it for the next  two and a half  weeks. This project really kind of consumed me  and there was not a  waking moment where I did not plan or work on it   until I was  driving it down the road. Now that its complete I am ready to pull it to  some  of my longer jobs and I will use it as a job shack.     This   cabin is really grabbing some attention locally and I have already had   some passerbys come over to  take a look inside. I hope to build  more of them down the road for those who might be interested. (Deek: Info on that is further below...)     The trailer is rated for about 5,000 lbs -dimensions are 5x10. I really wanted to keep the size down so I could pull it with ease (and the pile of lumber I loaded on it) when I picked it up. As for the large porch, the cabin is12 ft tall so instead of the two foot back porch, I shrunk the building down two feet to lessen the overall load and weight of the building.     As far as outfitting it, I am basically going to keep it \"camping style\" with small portable propane stoves and heaters within. I'm going to do some basic wiring so I can have power, and the overall plan is to basically design custom cubbies and benches for storage later on. Another one of my major plans, design wise, is to have some custom canvas skirts made for the back porch that connect up under the eaves of the cabin and then snaps onto the fence area and so as to enclose the deck.I do plan on building this model, and others, for people down the road. The price of the kits for a 6x8 is $3500 and one fully built for $4900. I will increase size all the way up to 6x16 for 7,000 (kit) and 9,800 (built). I will also build them 8ft wide all the way up to 8x14.

{"title": "Tiny In Tokyo- The Micro Cabin/House Cluster Approach....", "date": "Tuesday, January 24, 2012", "text": "First, real quick, THANK YOU again! \"Humble Homes, Simple Shacks\" has been the #1 selling book on Amazon.com for two days now! I make absolute crap off each book sold, but I'm more so glad that decent sales will mean I'll get to release ANOTHER tiny housing book down the road- one that's close to done already! You can order the new book- for $11.29- below...And...a cool find from www.shedworking.co.uk TINY, TOKYO-BASED, CLUSTER SHEDS/CABINS   These might be a little tiny for most, but the idea, and one not all that new, is pretty cool. I've often talked about this in response to people who say that the cabins I've built are too small, carry too few amenities, and just aren't logical for actual use. Most people also exclaim \"but there's no bathroom!\"- well, do like the majority of the world (not the US) and build a seperate outhouse or facility- problem solved. Or just add a tiny composting, sawdust toilet in one of them. You could clearly do the same with another mini kitchen outbuilding, and so on- or just cook outdoors. What people fail to realize is that I only have so much yard space, money, time, and energy, and that I build my little cabins as recycled-material examples of WHAT could be done with junk- I'm hoping, with them, to convey the ideas and approaches, more than \"You must live in this 30 square foot cabin\". I also already have my own small/modestly sized home, and 250 square foot Vermont Cabin, so there's no need to build anything \"BIG\" yet. I am, however, in the process of designing a REALLY easy to build, and affordable vacation cabin that is roughly 10' by 10'- which has a cooking area, a sleep bunk, and a tiny, tiny, bathroom. No billiards room though!    Anyway, I like the way this guy is thinking, although he'll be the recipient of critique, no doubt, from those who misread the message. Here's a guy who is DEFINITELY keeping it simple!  Again, I first saw this on Alex Johnson's very cool blog SHEDWORKING, which is definitely worth your time....and here's the info Alex offered up... This is a design from  Atelier Ichiku that he simply dubbed \"The Cabins\". These four mini sheds were built for a Japanese  writer so that he could work in one (which features a desk and shelf),  use another as a lavatory, the third as a prayer room and the final one  as storage. Each cabin is 90cm wide with a porthole window but they each  have various depths, as Architectural Review recounts (using lots more photos too).I say, in terms of both sides of this...THE PROS- small, EASY to build, VERY portable, affordable, you're forced out of doors more- in a day and age where people spend too much of their lives inside, easy to replace or fix if damaged or vandalized. THE CONS- getting from one to another when its raining, insulating them would lose further interior space (in such a small and confined area even losing a few inches of space would be noticeable), anchoring them and keeping them from blowing over- they seem so narrow and top heavy (this could be remedied easily though).Either way, it certainly is a visually intriguing design!"},

I was bumpin' around online last night and browsing through the JCS's site, when I also saw that they have a floor model or two of this very cabin, both selling damn reasonably, at under $7000. Being a stubborn do-it-yourselfer, its rare that I even consider buying anything off anyone else, especially cabin or shed related, but this Writer's Haven would be pretty incredible in a woodland setting if you didn't have the time, and know-how to set out upon building such a thing.

I'll have many more to come, and this will be one of the side focuses or topics (among MANY) in the Tumbleweed Tiny House Building Workshops I'll be teaching here and there. The first one I lead is in Miami, Florida on April 14-15- its gonna be fun! Check out http://www.tumbleweedhouses.com/workshops/miami/ to sign up....Under-stair shelving in my micro-office (the entire office was built from secondhand barn boards I grabbed at an estate sale for a grand total of under $40!). Overall, this little room is about 35 or so square feet, if I had to guess. Its where I run/operate this very blog. Currently, I'm overhauling this \"Cloffice\" (Closet-Office), which might possibly be filmed for a future episode of my show \"Tiny Yellow House\". I think Alex Pino (www.tinyhousetalk.com), \"The Floridian Funkster\" is going to be taking part too....(no, no one really calls him that, but you can start if you'd like!) Kidding...kidding..... PS- check out his site for some FREE cabin plans (I'll have more on that down the road). Anyway, Today's Tip....The underside of stairs, whether in the basement, or leading to a second living level, is often wasted space, with possible potential for small item storage. Bob \"Uncle Bob\" Bennett, one of my Vermont camp/cabin neighbors, and jack of all trades, has a set-up like this in his log cabin. In his case, as you descend from his kitchen to his basement workshop/man cave, you're presented with an array of tiny shelves, all designed to hold long-term canned goods- ya' know, in case of Armageddon, or a Godzilla attack. The idea works very well, and takes up less space than you'd think- just don't get overzealous with the size and depth of the shelves or some forehead bruising will surely be the outcome! Its for this reason that basement stairs are the best- you less frequently walk under them.This tip is one of many in a new chapter in my book \"Humble Homes, Simple Shacks\".....where you're also given small space design input from Lloyd Kahn (who has a GREAT new book out), Dee Williams, Jay Shafer, Kent Griswold, Alex Pino, Duo Dickinson, Cathy Johnson, Mimi Zeiger, Colin Beavan, Alex Johnson, Michael Tougias, Gregory Paul Johnson, and more.

Its the woodland seats, beds, shelves, and stone-built decorations that I like the most though- and there's a very healthy array of them within. I can't forget to mention the chapter on Axel Erlandson, an American Farmer and one time \"Tree Circus\" head, who patiently trained and grafted trees and limbs to grow in sculptural directions- LIVING chairs? trees in knots!? This guy was unbelievable.    \"Woodland Style\" is one of those books where with each successive viewing, I kept finding more and more fun, bizarre, and rather unique ideas- ones I felt that I might later want to incorporate into some of my builds in one way or another. Its not a \"Tiny House\" book, but while featuring a good variety of hand built items and homes, its not a far stretch from the mindset of many in the genre. And yeah, granted, a few of the ideas are a little ridiculous and out there, but they still make one think, and push design boundaries.

I told Steve Weissman and Jay Shafer, \"As long as its not Chernobyl, Compton, or Three Mile Island\" I'd be interested.\"It'll be a Tumbleweed Workshop, but one that incorporates my own styles, information, and specialties as well- salvaging materials for building (the why, how, and where), time saving building tips, how to build a tumbleweed or your tiny home for less (outside of salvaging), and so on.....  By the way, if you missed my tour of the original Tumbleweed house from a ways back, check out the video here... Anyway, I'm very much so looking forward to it, and perhaps I'll see some of you down there.  -Derek \"Deek\" Diedricksen"},

{"title": "Treehouses on the Brain- another one in the works.....", "date": "Thursday, January 12, 2012", "text": "TREE HOUSE TAGGING? (in a \"graffiti\" sense)sketches coming soon- more scanner probs! sorry.      This wasn't/isn't really a planned project, and I was talking a little bit about it last night when interviewed for GardenFork Radio with Eric Rochow. Basically, for the eye-candy-sake of those passing by on my road, and in the on-par spirit, somewhat, of off-season Christmas lights, I started pecking away at the base for what will be an incredibly tiny, decorative (although I'll be able to fit in it) treehouse/treefort.The view from below- DIRECTLY below. The platform, still in the works, sits about twenty feet off the ground- not that high, but still high enough to break your neck!       While clearing some sapplings and widow-makers/dead trees from the side of my tiny suburban lot (all of which will go to heat my home), I kept looking at this really unique scarlet oak tree that has taken on Dr. Seuss-like qualities over the years in its strife for light. Oak, being strong as all heck (even the dead tiny sappling branches on the tree were hard to snap and knock down) should provide ample strength for this little project, even given the cantilevering nature of this tree. Also, I figure, by trimming some less-healthy, and less productive limbs off the tree, I've taken away a little of the weight that this oak tree is used to carrying- so as to make way for the weight of ME and a tiny, tiny treehouse- one that will be more light-up sculpture than functional in anyway. Oh yeah, its right at an intersection too....     The idea is partly from an article that NPR's Jon Kalish sent me a ways back in which some anonymous artist in NYC built two extremely mini treehouses (birdhouse sized) and installed them on some sidewalk sapplings by the cover of night. I thought, \"What I great, fun, idea. Instead of graffiti as art, you could install these tiny treehouse and fort installations wherever- all for the public to view, and perhaps, draw some inspiration from.\" I would LOVE to see others do the same thing, and pass their photos around. This one random NYC guy inspired me to mess with this idea on a tangent level- so you never know where else we could take this! In the meantime, I'm just doing this for fun, and to give all the elementary school commuters, day and nighttime walkers, and passersby, something to gawk at.    I've had so many kids pass by my yard and comment positively on some of the cabins I've had out there (while being loaded for transport), that I hope something like this might inspire one of them and show them that carpentry can be adventurous, and easily accessible. There's more to life than video games and childhood obesity from inactivity.You can barely make out the platform here, but it gives you a sense of how close to the sidewalk it is. It'll be comical to sit up there and read a book, drink some coffee, and relax, and people, unaware, walk by below.       Speaking of treehouses, yup, there are many designs in the new edition of \"Humble Homes, Simple Shacks\"- and a few in the color photo gallery, from my brother's \"U.B. 30\" tree-sleeper, to one Harrison Reynolds built, that operates as a bnb in Lincoln, Vermont (See the video below...)-Derek \"Deek\" Diedricksen    Wow! These are just gorgeous, and alongside the Dickinson boat stoves, are a great space-saving option for heat in your small/tiny home, cabin, shack, or hut. I'd LOVE to work one of these Marine Brand or Dickinson heaters/stoves into a filmed client build for our \"Tiny Yellow House\" show someday- we'll see. Perhaps for \"The H-Hut\" prototype we want to build, or a fully outfitted NH treehouse that we might tackle in 2012.     Anyway, Most of these Navigator/Marine stoves take up barely more than 1 square foot of floor space (with some clearance space needed), and again, they're just so nice looking! Add these to my tiny house-outfitting dream list... (and commence drooling).

I also thought that you could take this goof-concept even further (I assume its an ice fishing shack of sorts), and have FAKE legs (anchored into the earth (not a pond), posed as if to look as they were mid-stride, serving as the \"pole\" supports of this cabin. It would work, and I just might have to make a spin-off sketch/design. \"A FORT (fishing shack/tiny shelter) ON FEET!\" What's clever, is that the sides appear to be some sort of stretched canvas or fabric, and by having it a dark color (black), you're using the sun's absorbed heat to your advantage, instead of freezin' your arse off in the middle of a frozen lake.  Anyway, make this one out of 1/4\" or 3/8\" plywood, with mere 1\" by 1\" outer-edge framing, and it would work, and would be \"carryable\". Just don't forget to cut a few airholes!

A BIG fan. I grew up with access to a small Cape Cod-style beach cottage my grandparents had (see a relaxshacksDOTcom channel video I shot), and since as long as I can remember, there was nothing more relaxing than sitting out next to their garage, atop a giant piece of slate, as I pruned myself under a hot shower....well, until my grandfather banged on the kitchen window (\"You're using up all the water. Its expensive!\") and turned the hot water off (the knob was under the sink) on me.These day I even have a passive solar shower in my backyard, made from a curb-found well tank, painted flat black, so I suppose the love for these outdoor showers hasn't left me. Yes, I use it (with a bathing suit on! Don't get scared).      In many cases, with ultra tiny homes, especially in temperate climates, these type showers (well, not the ones shown, I'm talking less pricey, less fancy, ones) could be the space-saving, and money saving answer you're looking for. Granted, where I live in Massachusetts (it was 9 degrees out yesterday) this might not be an all season route you want to pursue. Regardless, I hope you get some design and inspiration, or just \"kicks\", from the exceptional showers.  I was also inspired to do this post from a book I recently picked up titled \"THE OUTDOOR SHOWER\" by Ethan Fierro. If daydream landscapes and unique takes on outdoor showers are your thing, this book has quite a few ideas, and some great photos too. And Yup, I have some solar shower stuff in that new version of my book \"Humble Homes, Simple Shacks\"- which you can check out on Amazon.com by clicking HERE.

The one shown here uses two full standing sheets of plywood for EACH side- so its 64 square feet within, and eight feet tall- enabling you to possibly add a tiny half loft for sleeping, IF you don't need a ton of headroom below- or full and total standing room on one side of the structure (ie- if you placed a couch beneath the loft, etc). Also- on the way....-An interview I did with Tammy Strobel of Rowdykittens.com-Our new TREEHOUSE video episode of \"Tiny Yellow House\" (you might have seen it already and THANKS TO KENT GRISWOLD for posting on it too- he's at tinyhouseblog.com-New photos of out completed writer's retreat that I built and designed for horror author John Grover- which came out GREAT!

We shot a video (my first flip video ever and THE reason I bought the camera (an impulse buy) on the way) on it, which is posted below. Little would I know how much use that little $170 camera would see! I still get ticked off when I watch this video- this pond was among the cleanest I've ever seen! The plan was to toss the sketch/cabin, seen above, in a tree on the island, after floating it, pre-built, on a platform to the island. We checked some codes, and so on, and this seemed a loop hole so as to be able to build on such a postage-stamp-sized piece of land.

For those who have never been, Iceland is pretty amazing (amazingly expensive too- especially for alcohol/food). Years back I went there for three nights as part of an obscenely affordable travel package in the off season, and had a great time. Its unlike any landscape I have ever seen- almost purely volcanic rock, and very few trees to be found, making for a \"moon-like\", other-planetary, effect. Most of the homes are now built from a good deal of aluminum paneling, as alot of their lumber has to be imported, and it therefore expensive!      Anyway, I just loved this photo, and the red roof especially, to me, its calendar-worthy....great work Oskar!-Derek \"Deek\" Diedricksen"},

I bought this as a seat replacement for a kids art table we had in our home. Its tiny, but, as you can see below, easily holds up 210 or so pounds. What I like most about it, is the bold mix of a the naturally light wood, and the bright red storage cap- yes, lift up the top and you can store things within (the other thing I dig). Basically, without taking up any additional space, and replacing the old same-size seat we had before, we've now gained a small amount of hidden storage. As you well know, any little bit of storage gained in a tiny home, is nothing to scoff at! This chair lists for $19.99. TWO IKEA HACK ideas for the SANSAD....1. Want to hack this seat?- the hole in the center is just BEGGING for a lamp pole insert. Extend the legs and you have yourself a cool little night stand or end table....add a shelf below for magazines....and so on....2. This, by boxing it in, and taking out the storage area's bottom, could make for a funky, and affordable laundry hamper for a tiny home- it wouldn't take up much space at all- again, elongate the legs to make it more useful/sizeable.  Oh yeah- #16 in our \"SIXTY SHACKS SKETCHES IN SIXTY DAYS\" is coming in a little bit- my scanner is being a little problematic!

I already have a metal clad outhouse on the property of my Vermont cabin (see \"Tiny Yellow House Episode #5\" on Youtube) which we've dubbed \"The Bomb Shelter\", but when that one goes, some day, THIS is what I'm building! Its a simple design I came up with, sure to be a conversation piece for those who first visit it at night when camping out with us. Again, this \"SIXTY SHACK SKETCHES IN SIXTY DAYS\"  towards the release of the new edition of my book is what I felt would be a fun countdown to \"Humble Homes, Simple Shacks, Cozy Cottages, Ramshackle Retreats, Funky Forts (And Whatever The Heck Else We Could Squeeze In Here!)\" which is up now on Amazon.com). These sketches are not in that book, and are rougher than what you'll find in \"Humble Homes...\", but represent some lesser seen, or unseen, stuff I've been sitting on. And, since the holidays are just about here, if you need a fun, bizarre, gift for a friend who just happens to own a camp with an outhouse....look no further (below). I've read this book twice, and not only does it have some great photos of some very unique outhouses, but it gives a ton of history on them, and insight into the current sub-culture that still thrives around the concept and subject matter. And yes, there is an outhouse museum/historical society- its based in Halifax, Nova Scotia. I'd love to visit it, especially since Halifax is such a beautiful city.-Derek \"Deek\" Diedricksen"},

A good many things could be done with this simple, affordable design.

I also got word that all the new edition printings of \"Humble Homes, Simple Shacks\" are back from the printers (PRINTED IN THE USA! I made sure they didn't outsource the work), and a pre-release copy is on its way to me as I type this.

His log cabin is also featured (alongside 40+ other cabins) in the color photo insert section of the new version of my book \"Humble Homes, Simple Shacks\". AND....#13, in our \"Sixty Shack Sketches In Sixty Days\" pen-spree is below as well. Man, this ain't easy! FORTY SEVEN more new sketches to go! Yikes! Anyway, I'll leave things to David....    The House of Fallen Timbers blog started out as an online journal of my attempt to build a small log cabin from fallen trees and found materials for as little money as possible. Intended to be a sort of brag book to share with family and friends who were not able to visit the cabin and see the work I had done it eventually became much more.I live on about four acres of wooded land that had not been maintained for many decades. Very little effort had been made to manage the forest. Long dead trees were scattered around the property. It was dangerous to walk in parts of the woods and the dead trees were damaging the live ones. At first the goal was to clean up the woods and make it safer. After a quick survey it became clear that I had a huge job ahead of me. We do have a fire pit we use for the occasional cookout but there was no way we would burn anywhere near this amount of wood before it turned to mud. I have always been interested in frontier and pioneer life so without a clue of what I was getting myself into I decided to try building a cabin.I honestly didn’t believe I would end up with anything but a woodpile in the end so I didn’t want to spend much money on it. I scavenged most of the materials I couldn’t make myself. In the end I spent roughly $200.00 mostly on foam insulation, gas and blades for my eight year old chainsaw.I spent hours online looking for instructions about everything from how to drop a leaning tree to notching a log. I found hundreds of terrific examples, tutorials, and forums from all over the world. As my bookmarks grew I began to wish I had a single link to all the information. This was the beginning of the blog.Soon I was linked into a community of like minded enthusiasts with a wide range of interests. Folks into forest management, simple living, log construction, quiet spaces, re-purposing, junkers, sheddies, tiny housers, and even manly skills enthusiasts began to network with me online. The blog has now been featured on several other blogs and the cabin was awarded third place in the United Kingdom’s - Shed Blog - International Shed of the Year competition!Most recently Deek honored me with the inclusion of my cabin in his soon to be published “Humble Homes, Simple Shacks, Cozy Cottages, Ramshackle Retreats, Funky Forts: And Whatever the Heck Else We Could Squeeze in Here – New Triple-Caffeinated Expanded Edition!” Thanks Deek!I hope you enjoy the blog. Please understand that it is not meant to be a how-to kind of thing. I’m very lucky I didn’t hurt myself considering how clueless I was when I started.

Obviously, I'd still use a carbon monoxide detector in your tiny house, shack, or cabin when using something like this, and more importantly, before you cut into ANY propane tank (BOOM!!!) check out a few of the many tutorials and chat discussions on doing so that are everywhere online.

A ways back I listed a post on my \"Top Ten Tiny House Books\" and D.C. Beard's famous \"Shelters, Shacks, and Shanties\" was in that very list.     More recently, review-wise, I purchased \"The Field And Forest Handy Book\" (much like \"The American Boys Handy Book\" in style), and for a mere five bucks and change, with free shipping, NEW, I have to say it was a hell of a steal! Yes, some of the info and illustrations amongst his other books overlaps (partly because of so many reprint and new publishing company changeovers through the years), and you may never need to know how to trail-pack a horse, or cook a muskrat, but half of that unnecessary information is part of the eclectic charm of it all! Of course, there are passages on tool and axe use, log cabin building, naturally thatched huts, tiny woodsman abodes, and more...As you can see, the sketches are just incredible too! My great grandfather, alive around the D.C. Beard era (Theodore Diedricksen) had a fairly similar style as was the head professor of art at Yale University. I often wonder if the two ever met, as I'm sure they were aware of each other's work. Theodore Diedricksen was also the illustrator of many books (adult and children's alike), and had his work displayed at many galleries, and commissioned for large sporting events. Even as recently as a year or two ago, there was a showing of his art at a Connecticut gallery.As for my sloppier work- lol....again, the NEW and EXPANDED version of my book \"Humble Homes, Simple Shacks\" is now up on Amazon.com for pre-order, and from now until its release, I'll be posting many new sketches (unreleased ones- NOT in \"Humble Homes\") that I've been sitting on....for the fun of it, and yes, the help promote the book (as I'd love them to ask me to do another, if this one does well enough).So #11 in \"SIXTY SHACK SKETCHES IN SIXTY DAYS\"....is a single-sleeper, micro-hut, with the intent of birdwatching, in mind.

The Christmas tree cut into the door is a touch of his own.     These \"box store\" sheds cost in the $1000-2000, and it certainly could be an option, for those without the skills, tools, or time, in terms of a pre-built housing shell (not a roadworthy one, mind you).

For instance, the wild-as-all-hell \"paintjob house\" isn't so notable as a home itself, or architecturally (no offense, if you're the owner!), but the paint work and artistic addition of so much color to its exterior makes it a very fun, one-of-a-kind, and creatively ballsy building. I'm sure the neighbors hate it, and I'd dread having to repaint it all someday, but it sure is something else! The A-frame above (and sorry, I have NO IDEA who built these, I couldn't find anything- if YOU do, let us know) on the other hand is more \"conventional\" as a \"Double A\" guest room or office (yoga studio perhaps?), but through its trim work and triangular window placement, holds its own individual charm- I'm a sucker for A's too!

Today I focused on attaching a good deal of the cedar trim work, having just roofed this two days back. Basically, aside from interior shelving, an eventual wood stove, and trimming out the (recycled- free!) door and putting in a new lockset, I'm just about done. Just in time too- as the winter weather is just around the corner which leaves me S.O.L. and less productive, as I have no actual woodshop. Ultimately, weather-pending, this little greenhouse/writer's retreat will be stained with a protective coat, and some of the woodwork will be touched up with a new layer of white paint.

The window in the rear is homemade as well, from one sash of a recycled window, and trimmed out with new wood.Since the greenhouse is so small I wanted the door to swing OUT to save space, and so that any winds blowing against the cabin would actually push the door shut more tightly, and give it a better seal. Basically, although it will additionally be used as an escape for an author (writer's retreat) this little structure could easily be adapted in use and design towards a little vacation cabin in the woods, or even a tiny home. The design is so simple, and where/when possible uses stock-length lumber so as to minimize cuts and waste.

SO....with a single small ad sponsor, I'd love to build a mini-shack on wheels, and donate it to one of the local camps. Again, like this movement or not, this is a great chance to apply some designs and get some lived-in feedback on what could be improved, what works, and what might be needed/workable.      There are several new restrictions as to what is allowed at Dewey Square in Boston, so we'd try to work around/with that, and/or donate this to Occupy Albany, if need be. Heck, I'd love to try two builds in two locales, but we'll start with one and see if it flies.I'm thinking I could build a really decent one, FILM THE BUILD (so you're helping with an all new episode, full of NEW recycled-material ideas too), for about $200/$250. In turn, say, if you ran a related business, your ad/logo would be seen by a ton of people (and if you're worried about politics, I don't have to mention you in the other build video- just the Tumbleweed Tour one). You can contact me through the email in the left hand column of this blog... or its kidcedar at gmail dot com.     I'll be donating about a dozen or more hours (time I barely have) into this already, so some small support would be great.DONATIONS: I suppose if you'd like to make a small donation too (and I'll thank you in the Tumbleweed video)- you could send them to the paypal id- senorsell@hotmail.com   Meanwhile, I've also shot a TON of other videos, so as I slowly find the time, I'll be releasing those on my youtube channel- http://www.youtube.com/relaxshacksdotcom-Derek \"Deek\" Diedricksen (all photos by)(For fans of: Tiny Homes, Small Houses, Tree house, Tree fort, Homeless Shelter, Shacks, Shed, Shedworking, Shanties, Huts, Small Cabins, Vacation Cottages).Only $11.49- The NEW and EXPANDED version of my book- link is in the left hand column of this blog."},

I've made a few of these before, and actually did a demo with this very plate while speaking at M.I.T, and brought the same plate out to NYC when I was asked to speak at Jay Shafer's Tiny Tumbleweed House Company's workshop in Manhattan. Its not brain surgery, but the video will be coming at some point. Total cost for this window- approx. $1.00 (well, plus 8 recycled screws, and a thin bead of caulk or so. The wood trim was free/salvaged).The window, \"roughed in\" (not painted/sanded). I made AND filmed this project (another idea/concept from my \"Humble Homes, Simple Shacks\" book (link below)) in a mere 50 minutes tonight- most of the time was spent on setting, and re-setting the camera and watching playbacks. Not painted, nor touched-up yet, the newly cut window now makes the once bland and featureless door of \"The Gypsy Junker\" a little more interesting. The door always was the one thing I thought was boring in terms of the cabin's appearance. The same method can be used with unrolled, soda bottle plastic (slit the bottle vertically, and unroll it into a sheet after cutting the \"funnel end\" and \"ass end\" off of it). In the past, when building chicken coops for people, I've done this several times. I works well and costs just about nothing.SPEAKING OF WHICH.... our contest for several books on tiny housing is still running until Dec 10th....be sure to visit the \"Tiny Yellow House and Relaxshacks.com\" facebook open group for details/to jump in for your chance to win $100 in tiny home/architectural reading.And for MORE on junk-built windows....if you missed it...-Derek \"Deek\" Diedricksen"},

It was a two hour presentation, complete with a side trip out to \"The GottaGiddaWay\" micro shelter, which I had towed out as a surprise for those in attendance. Anyway, just a few photos here for now...  The GottaGiddaWay Cabin on Memorial Drive in Boston- I had to parallel park a van with a trailer near rush hour in the city- not fun. I somehow managed to find a double length spot (a free one too!), and do it in one take. M.I.T.'s gargantuan media lab- somewhat of an oxymoronic place to hold a tiny-housing-themed meeting.

So far, things are coming along nicely, and quickly- which is great, since I'm fighting the impending winter here in New England, which can be brutal.     Basically, the plan is to eventually get the clear roof on, then from that point afterward, at least in the daytime, I'll have a solar-heated environment to work in when I tackle all the trim and small details. Also, even in the dead of winter, inside this 6' by 12' solar cabin, I'll be able to effectively caulk, and foam seal certain trim gaps, and door jambs- as otherwise, these sealants would not set or cure in such freezing temperatures. This photo was taken from the far/back end of this tiny little solar greenhouse/shack. That wall has now since been filled in, and we set a recycled window in it as well. The second-hand, six-foot tall Anderson windows you see in the photo were bought on craigslist for $400 (these normally are well over $1000 each!). The gaps between them will eventually be trimmed up with cedar battens, and their interiors re-painted. Sustainably grown Vermont white cedar (which I primarily use when I can- and get from a mill near my camp up there). This tiny little house-like cabin could EASILY be insulated with foam/poly panels and made into a summer vacation cottage. The view would be GREAT, say, facing a lake, with all those windows! ...and, JUST TODAY, I submitted my last photo addition to my NEW version of \"Humble Homes, Simple Shacks\"- it hits the printers THIS week- and will be mailed out to all pre-order folks for Feb 1st (its release date).

They collect, refurbish, and sell second-hand clothes, household appliances, furniture and bicycles, and eat the products of their non-conventional farm.    While renovating its trailer camp, the community has created an eco-building workshop, open to all. Six tiny, ecological and economical houses have already been built with wood, straw or reused materials.Every one is designed in accordance with the dream of the homeowner -- octagonal and half-timbered, on stilts, lop-sided, looking like a drop or a Klondike tent... The areas are between 35 and 45 square meters (377 and 484 square feet). Thanks to wood fiber and ''métisse,\" a new insulating material made with recycled clothes, heating is four times cheaper than in the trailers. There is also a log stove, a washing machine with recycled rainwater, a sawdust toilet and Wi-fi. Cost: from 20 000 to 30 000 euros (from $28,300 to $42,400). Quite revolutionary when you think that the community lives solely on the reuse of consumer society's wastes, without any public subsidies!One can see a slideshow about each building site on:http://www.emmaus-lescar-pau.com/fr/la_maison_de_christophe-128-5.html#5from lloydkahn.com-Derek \"Deek\" Diedricksen"},

From the sign posted near the rock:This great glacial erratic has been a part of the history and folklore of Franconia Notch for generations. Thomas Boise, a noted teamster of this region was sledding through the notch in midwinter, soon after the first road was built. Overtaken by a fierce snowstorm he was unable to continue on. Realizing he must take drastic action to survive, he killed and skinned his horse. Crawling under the overhang of this rock, he wrapped himself in the hide and spent the night. Men sent out the next day to search for him found Tom still alive but encased in the frozen hide that had to be cut away with axes in order to release him.Yeah, no thanks, I'll take a Super 8 any night, even with bed bugs....

Its also about $80-$100 rescued from my wallet! In some cases its actually more of a savings than that. -And the tea kettle shown above- I don't plan to use it for tea, I just got sick of looking at the humidifying bread pan on top of my woodstove. I kinda liked the 70s \"sunburst\" color on it too.Anyway, Monday, its off to a speaking engagement at M.I.T. of all places, which should be fun- their campus is gorgeous too, so I'm looking forward to it, and to checking out some of my old haunts in Boston afterward.

This particular A-frame, in Yosemite, is all yours for $220 a night- given the cabin, the locale, and the fact that it sleeps four, I'd say the price is well worth it.      Rent it or not, it still might serve as some idea and eye-candy for something of your own down the road- especially seeing as how basic in construction an a-frame is. If I were to build my own tiny house or camp in the woods, and had little time, money, and skills, I might just go this route.Click on any of the photos to enlarge them..... and for MORE info....http://www.boutique-homes.com/vacation-rentals/americas/united-states/a-frame-cabin-far-meadow/-Derek \"Deek\" Diedricksen"},

This is the neighbor's log cabin that we stayed in- a first for me. This cabin resides at the very end of the dirt road that my land is on as well. We've stayed in my own camp/cabin in sub zero temperatures before (we didn't have heat then, just really good sleeping bags), but this time around, with an offer to stay on the plate, I thought it'd be cool (we had a few friends up as well) to stay in a log cabin for change. In the upper front of the cabin you can see a newly installed solar panel, a harbor freight $159 one, that worked very well. I'll be curious to see how it lasts, but we had two cfl bulbs on for a seven hour stretch and the marine battery was still holding a strong charge. I've been tempted to get one of these solar kits to mess around with it myself, and now having seen one in action, I just may have to pull the trigger. I linked the exact kit below, for anyone interested in reading up on its specs.The remnants of past dinners on another nearby log cabinAfter night two we awoke to find it snowing, and proceeded to pack out stuff up quickly as we have to drive up a hill or two on backroads to get out of these woods- without 4x4 vehicles.

This time around, we actually got a ton done, from installing a (recycled) door, to framing out (trim and all) a huge Anderson window that Dustin nabbed on craigslist for about $50.00. Those windows usually run about $1200.00 new! Its certainly pays to scrounge, seek, and buy second hand....     We also managed to install a wood stove (finally!), and ran a long run of flue pipe from it so as to maximize the heat output (to let it radiate indoors, instead of out). While the new section of the cabin is far from done/sealed, it still is great to have that wood stove in there. We worked at night setting it up by gas-lantern lights (we have no electricity), and celebrated with a beer or two, in front of this cast iron beast. Those Coleman Lanterns have saved our asses and extended our work hours (and productivity) so many times- and they've taken a beating from us- and still are going strong! I posted, for the sake of convenience, a link to the exact model I have, below. I own two of these- one of them is about fourteen years old now, and still works great. The amount of light these give off really is incredible- in fact, all of the night shots of our \"Tiny Yellow House\" Vermont Cabin episode were shot under lantern light- and nothing but. Working on the wood stove's flue- in 28 degree weather on night #2.  Its a Scandia, which, as I understand, is more or less a lesser priced rip-off of Yotuls, and other models.

In the meantime, I had this one saved from earlier in the year and realized I never had posted it.     All you shipping container/conex box housing fans out there, you'll love the simplicity of this one. not to mention the affordability, I'm sure- as most used containers this size on run $2000-$3000.      Containers are a great option to consider if you're looking into downsizing and building a low-cost micro-home/tiny house. There are an enormous amount of books on the subject now.Both of my books, \"Humble Homes, Simple Shacks\" and \"Quick Camps and Leg Cramps\" have Conex Box/Storage Container ideas/sketches/plans in them- and I've drafted many more in the meantime, which I'll get up on the blog eventually.The SushiBOX Restaraunt is an Eatery That Knows How to Pack it In     The SushiBOX Restaurant brings Japan’s reputation for excellent space efficiency to the downtown core of Austin, Texas.The compact eatery fits snugly inside a 20’ shipping container that  has three sides, which can unfold to create open awnings. Because it was  built on a trailer chassis, the SushiBOX restaurant is also potentially  mobile, but for now the remarkable (and insulated!) and efficient  establishment has no plans to relocate. The SushiBOX Restaurant was able to open up shop without causing any  greenhouse gasses because the business chose to recycle.

These are additional, often overlooked rules and tips to keep in mind when building your own small house, or for any construction/carpentry project. I was shipped out to NYC a few weekends ago as a guest speaker for Jay Shafer's Tumbleweed Tiny House Workshop and this was one of the things that was incorporated in my 90 minute presentation- we had fun with it, and many in the audience chimed in with their own \"self-learned\" tips as well- some which I'll share down the road. This is my way of saving YOU some time and hassle, as I've learned many things the hard way in my 20+ years of tiny structure building.....RULE #1WHILE I'M A THRIFTY GUY, AND HELD OUT FOR TOO LONG ON THIS ONE (I've only realize the severe error of my ways more recently)- \"THOU SHALL NOT CHEAP OUT WHEN BUYING A HAND SAW\". There ARE many things you can buy the low-end bargain versions of (covered in other future rules), but this, I feel, is not one of them.Wanna tire out prematurely while on the job and later have your arm feel like an elephant sat on it? Go ahead, use that rusted, dull, cheapo saw. On the other hand. if you want to cut through wood like butter (you won't realize the difference until you go from a cruddy old average saw to a new, higher-end one) then consider at least getting a middle of the road tool for your cutting jobs.I personally TRY to not use power tools when I can help it (although they are incredibly helpful!)- I just don't want their interuptive noise when I'm in some peaceful outdoor setting out in the middle of the woods (for jobs in those style locales).But seriously, a $3.99 Harbor Freight saw just isn't going to cut it. Some of their other tools WILL, but opt for a decent enough hand saw. Your arm, your time, your patience, and ultimately, your project, will thank you for it. Mine, its the Stanley Fat Max Saw (Armored version)- not too expensive, and cuts very nicely.

Grow 'em, Dive for 'em....Trader Joe's has the most reasonable roses I've yet to come across- FREE- dozens and dozens of them (at least the other day).      So, I usually don't do much dumpster diving (I'm more a curbside culler), although I do love the idea (I just never think to, or have time), but the food broker Trader Joe's always seem to have so much decent tossed stuff. This time, as I peered in through the dumpster door, aside from many bags of decent looking produce (which I didn't bother checking- but which I would have grabbed in a second if I were homeless, hungry, or just broke) I found about twelve dozen-rose bouquets- no rot, all fresh, and at worst, an ocassional single wilted petal- HUNDREDS of dollars of roses. Wow. I grabbed three dozen, as I really had no need for them (or any more than that), but it was a shame to see so much waste. Needless to say, they're in a vase on the dining room table now- and YES, I did tell my wife where they came from- not that it really should matter. She had no problem with their origins. Diving is addictive I tell ya, once you get by the social stigmas. A punk-looking employee even saw me grabbing the roses while looking around, and gave me a smile and a wave- she seemingly approved. Again, a few months back (covered in an old blog post), I even saw a woman driving a LEXUS diving in the very same dumpster taking away a trunkload of potted plants.This method of \"materials acquisition\" is great for the budget conscious- and can easily be applied towards the building of your own tiny home. Want hardware? keep checking behind mom n' pop hardware stores, or occasionally behind the big chain stores (although they often guard their trash as if it were GOLD, locking it and all- liabilities, wanting you to spend money instead, etc). Lumber? Talk to any employees at a construction site- or just peek in worksite dumpsters. You're actually doing these crews a favor (if you don't get hurt), as they have to pay their dumpster pick-ups based on weight.  A few great books on the subject- and \"slumming\" it/living a low budget/no-budget lifestyle...THE ART AND SCIENCE OF DUMPSTER DIVING- Crude, Raw, Humorous, and Damn Informative. Amy Dacyzyn- author of \"The Tightwad Gazette\" series trashed this book in a review, saying it contained foul language, ideas of questionable morals, and was too weird. Well, after reading it, those are the things that makes the books so great and unique. THE MONEYLESS MAN- a newer offering that I just read. Some crazy, and ballsy ideas/lifestyles within. EVASION (I dug it, although its kinda preachy in its perspective from a very young straight-edge, vegan kid. I'm neither and found some of the book's rants annoying, but it still was a really entertaining read- a great insight into the underground of this scene. Some great train-hopping tales too.). This book is definitely not for everyone, as it DEFINITELY deals with some questionable actions and subject matter, and its main character isn't all that likeable. Did I sell you on this one yet? lol- I still enjoyed it, as its so guttural and different (and in its 4th printing now, I believe).       I've also been pecking away the last few hours on a new mini video on that tiny $200 vacation shelter/camp hut that was built at our 2011 Relaxshacks.com Workshop here in Massachusetts. The cabin sold a little ways back (to fund ANOTHER video- in the works!), and is no longer in my possession, but luckily I filmed a little tour of \"The Little Blue Bump\" before she left the lot.I also started building a passive solar micro-house heater today as well- which I'll most likely be shooting a video on, for Make Magazine/Tiny Yellow House as well.  The interior of the micro $200 vacation shelter \"The Little Blue Bump\"-Derek \"Deek\" DiedricksenLive on \"Caveman TV\" (aka \"Fire\"), its sizzling burgers! Forget Burger King, THIS is flame broiled.      Note: This blog entry, and camping trip, were partly inspired by a discussion thread we had recently on our \"Tiny Yellow House and Relaxshacks.com\" group on facebook (you can join in the righthand column- scroll down). The chat dealt with ways in which to get your kids outside, inspired, into building and creating, self-sufficient, and interested in life's simple (and often \"Free\") things....     This weekend isn't even over yet, and its been great- first off, I decided to take my nephew and some friends of mine camping last night- I mean being dropped off at a trail head in the woods, no swimming pools, arcades, and concrete fire pits, camping (not that there's anything too wrong with that). Suffice to say, it was a great time, we listened to several eerie deer calls early in the night (which sounded like those long, low-end, plastic party horns- or a donkey) which almost seemed to circle us for awhile, and even cooked burgers the \"non-pan way\", ala from my old boy scout days, on a fire-heated rock. It works really well, if you haven't tried it before, and no frying pan to clean afterward! I didn't bring supplies for \"poor man's apple pie\"- but I tossed the \"recipe\" below. Its a great, quick, and fun way- which I've done on, and IN, our families wood stove many times. Burger #1 (the guinea pig- like pancakes, the first one never comes out all that good lookin'), with a multi-tool in the foreground (never camp- or build- without one).       As for the burgers, the trick is to build the fire against a pre-selected flat-top rock, and let it heat up for a good two hours or so, or at least until its \"hot as hell\" (to put it non-technically)- then toss the burger (or whatever) on the slab, and flip 'em with a multi-tool or jack knife- being careful not to burn your hand (you gotta work quickly!). Its a great lesson in appreciation for kids, in terms of taking things like stoves and microwaves for granted. And yes, you can bring a spatula camping, I just try not to bring much when I'm hiking things in. \"Hey boy, you want a burger?\"\"Sure!\"\"Gimme two hours or so....\"I also worked quite a bit today on the greenhouse/horror-writer's retreat, and made some good headway. The front, second-hand, windows are up, and even some roof rafters as well. There's still a long ways to go, but it'll be really cool when its done.POOR MAN'S APPLE PIE- perfect for camping, wood stove cookery, cheapo desserts....Peel an apple.Core it- leaving a shaft/hole all the way through it.Stuff the lower third of the hole with butterStuff the upper half with brown sugarSprinkle cinnamon or cinnamon sugar on the outside of the appleWrap in two layers of aluminum foilToss that sucker on some fire coals for awhile (in general, nowhere TOO hot, or the foil will burn)When cooked/soft, open and eat!

Whatever the case, thanks to Kirsten Dirksen and the Faircompanies.com crew for hosting/creating this video, and for the damn- cool write-up- wow. For those who haven't checked out their site, you're really missing out- TONS and TONS of amazing videos on small living, tiny housing, and a whole lot from the green movement. I can't personally wait to check out the Lloyd Kahn one she recently filmed (one of a small handful for people/builders that I respect most- another being Lester Walker). BOTH of those two are tied into the new edition of my book, by the way...(way below...)From Faircompanies.com....Derek “Deek” Diedricksen’s backyard is filled with- what to the untrained eye- might appear children’s forts, but these tiny dwellings are actually how he makes his living (mostly).Ask him his job title and he’ll reply, “I call myself a tinkerer or I've come up with bizarre-chitect or lark-chitect being kind of a fake architect.”Diedricksen’s obsession with tiny architecture began unsurprisingly, with the backyard forts of his youth. But he wasn’t your average construction-minded kid.Timeline of a micro home builderAt age ten he built his first cabin, complete with electricity, insulation, heat and a platform bunk. When he was 14 he read Lester Walker’s book Tiny Houses and discovered there were others out there like him.By the time he stumbled upon the Small House Movement a decade or two later, he had already built dozens of tiny structures. “Tiny architecture, micro architecture seems very newsworthy these days. I've been doing this for literally almost 20 years or so and up until a few years ago I never realized there was a whole movement. I was just some schmo in my basement with a gigantic collection of tiny housing books, building cabins in the woods as an adult.”Today, his backyard is filled with tiny cabins, forts, retreats, shelters, shacks and no two are alike. Most of his dwellings are multi-purpose: there’s the 20-square-foot travel trailer/emergency homeless shelter (Gottagiddaway), the roughly 6 square foot treehouse/chicken coop (the Wedgie) and the 11-square-foot kiosk/single-sleeper (the Gypsy Junker).A $110 sleeper hut and a $80 micro officeHe builds small and he works with a micro-budget. His Gottagiddaway AKA “$100 homeless hut” was built for about that (or perhaps as high as $110). His 32-square-foot micro-office (where he filmed his interview) was built for $80 from barn sale/ barn demo materials.His materials are salvaged from old buildings, lumber mills, recycyling and the dump. His windows are made from old office water coolers, soda bottles, pickle jars and even a washing machine window (a side from the same machine has become one if his drop-down tables).One discarded cedar lounge chair inspired an entire cabin. The Hickshaw- a “rickshaw for hicks”- has the same dimensions as the chair (2 1/2 feet wide by 6 1/2 feet deep) and can be rolled by one person.None of Diedricksen’s backyard creations are lived in full-time though he has camped in at least a few of them, uses them for a bit of shedworking for writing his blog and reserves the right to send unwanted guests in that direction.Tiny homes as punk rockBuilding tiny is also a way to rebel a bit. “There's almost this whole outlaw aspect of it. I've kind of been a little anti-authoritarian most of my life playing in punk bands and what-not and a lot of the housing codes and rules to me, while some of them make good sense, a lot of them are just ridiculous and very antiquated.”In 2009 he self-published (from his basement) his own hand-illustrated ode to tiny dwellings: Humble Homes, Simple Shacks, Cozy Cottages, Ramshackle Retreats, Funky Forts. He’s sold 3,000 copies to date and is releasing the second edition early next year.His mini-dwellings are mostly just prototypes for “larger” 100- or 200-square-foot homes, but through his miniature bungalows, he hopes to show the world that living small is normal.“It's the way I grew up, I just love it,” says Diedricksen who grew up in a small home and today lives with his wife and two children in a 900-or-so-square-foot home. “Why waste most of your life paying for a house you're never going to be in because you're out working 80 hours a week to afford it, but you're working so many extra hours for this huge house that you need to heat, you need to furnish, you need to maintain, you need to clean. The bigger the house, the more of your short and finite life you're using up to make those ends meet when you don't really need a house like that.”[Music credit: Bill Bracken, acoustic guitar][Photos credit: Bruce Bettis]"},

Cold beer, seating, grilling, cooling (fan), storage, and rain protection- all in one little area/deck.      Dana is also a master recycler, bargain hunter, and clever/thrifty guy- with some very decent insight/knowledge in green energy and practice- some of which he might attempt to bring to the city of Waterville, ME- which has a gorgeous, old fashioned downtown, great restaurants, and even an independent bookstore or two! I do recommend a visit- there's lots to discover in that area.The Sennett Camp (the main house- also very small (not shown)) will be in the photo insert collection/section of my book (the new edition- below).

In terms of setting up camp in the woods, if you ever got booted from a site, it'd simply be a matter of picking up the yokes/handles and rolling elsewhere. This structure could make for a fun and effective little art studio, reading spot, yoga room (if a little larger), guest bunker, or even a traveling vending/sleeper cart (for places like Burning Man Festival, Coachella, Life is Good Festival, etc). I'd personally like to see something like this in treehouse/treefort mode- an easy conversion. A \"Hawk's Eye View\"     I do hope he builds it, as I'd love to get him back on video to showcase something like this. As for more info from Sage himself.....(taken from his facebook posts, and more recent emails with me).This (The Woods Wagon) is an idea for a human-drawn wagon for cold-weather dwelling in the woods for a day to a couple weeks. Goal is 100 pounds or lighter .. propane stove/heater (vented outside of course) .. 25 square feet inside. Polycarbonate canopy, double layer for warmth. Load up with books, tea, oatmeal, millet, a small guitar, and goI think it's a lot like some of your designs/cabin in function and concept.My one main concern is where to find sheets of polybicarbonate? It may be pricey though .. but I think worth it for the clarity of the sky view.   Two layers, as well, for insulation.   I don't think I'll get to build it this year .. it would be so awesome if I could .. you're welcome, and anyone else, to take any ideas from it of course!  It draws from your philosophy and work as well.     My idea was to have a propane heater that is vented to the outside, but would radiate most of its heat inside the thing, and I think a pilot light size flame would heat the space in all but the coldest weather.    I picture a metal box with a glass window for the heater, within the small countertop ... and placing a heat radiator on top of the metal box for heating ... then removing that heat radiator  (you know, something like this) and turning up the flame when you want to cook on the top of the box, to make tea or whatever.I also picture a tiny sink that drains to the outside, for simple washing.  Just an inch deep or so.Perhaps I can get to it.  I would love to spend time in it, reading down at the pond near my house ... -SageSAGE AT WALDEN WOODS?

A ways back, Readymade Magazine (R.I.P. :( ) offered up these plans (\"The MD100 (Modular Dwelling)\" by Edgar Blazona) for a tiny backyard modern shed/shed-office/guest house structure- one that could apparently be built for $1500.00 in materials. Its a mere 10' by 10' in size, but a decent and viable option for micro-housing, if tweaked, perhaps, in a few ways (for the use/needs of my particular client).Free Plans Link:  http://www.scribd.com/doc/14755925/Edgar-Blazona-MD100-Plans-11x17  A great looking shed and photo, but c'mon, could you have at least found a more comfortable chair!? I mean, you might as well read from atop a stack of cinder blocks!      The reason I bring this up; I met with a future-project client the other day, who wanted a variation of this little shed/mini-cabin built in their yard. I'm game, but offered the following suggestions/changes....(esp. as I've NEVER worked from anyone else's plans as of yet- not that I'm so much opposed).Photo by Humberto Howard-Nix the front/total windows (a cost savings perhaps) as you'll roast in there with the orientation given.-Add a window (in exchange) in the back (or more)- for some natural light- so as to possibly eliminate more need/use of lighting and electricity. -Potentially add a tiny deck/platform out front to add some interior use/living space to a shed like this. In their case, its going to be used more as a shed, so a front deck with a table and two chairs, and a few adornments, would make this structure look less like a utility shed just plopped down in their yard. Instead, it'd have more of an appealing, multi-functional look to it. -Box out one spot/small portion of the interior to make a kid's fort/hideout for their daughter (accessed through a seperate entrance). The top of this boxed out region could be used as a bed platform, or a raised area for interior storage (in the main part of the MD100 offshoot). -Fill in the exterior walls with tongue and groove Vermont White Cedar (her recommendation on my offering of it) to give it a rustic, yet still modern, look. Again, this would eliminate the human-cooking huge window fronts too.-Funktify, or custom build a better door...-Add a tiny loft area- for additional sleeping or built-in storage. This project probably won't begin until 2012 (one of the disadvantages of living in a cold-seasonal area, I suppose) but its something that is sure to be alot of fun (and hard work), and something that I'M SURE we'll film for \"Tiny Yellow House\" TV.Here's a link to an old two page article on my book that ran in Readymade Magazine....man, I miss that mag!

A Backyard Shed Autopsy (And yes, the old SIDING, is rubber roofing- which actually works well- even though it looks like hell).       As for the backstory on this, a woman in my town was given my information from another local neighbor who I built a deck for last year, and was in need of some \"shed fixing\". As it turns out, her now deceased husband had built this shed thirty-five years ago (not a bad run!), and although it was a total wreck, she couldn't bring herself to tear it down. All in all, she wanted a \"band aid\" visual fix for the front, but after opening the wall I soon found out that aside from an old leak that had rotted out much of the plywood sheathing, carpenter ants were EVERYWHERE and had done some very significant damage to the framing as well. .So....the \"one-portion of a wall quick fix\" soon became a total rebuilding of one wall's framing, and a completely new, and very simple facade for the front face of the shed. I really wanted to go above and beyond for this woman and add a little deck/platform with a pergola, another window, an exterior shelf for plants, and a lantern light or two (at no cost, but more for fun), but she insisted it remain as plain and simple as possible and was against all of those ideas- which I would have done, again, for zip- which I don't think she fully understood. Some of the re-framing, AND the replacement/addition of two windows (both found in a dumpster- which saved her, and I, a good deal of time and money (this way I didn't have to charge her for new windows)).       That, said, after a mere six hours (of ass bustin' though)- here's what we came up with.

A cabin/small home like this could actually be built rather affordably- as the most difficult and costly part would be setting the enormous poles (recycled telephone poles- rather easy to obtain) in the ground and in position. You might have to rent a small crane and a large auger machine/truck to do so. The rest of the vacation cabin is a mere bolt-together boxy structure, where you could add in windows wherever you please. Its certainly a do-able, and rather bizarre take on a beach house.  As for the new cover....here's what it looks like (with perhaps a few minor tweaks).....you can pre-order the book down below....thanks! The cover shown below is just the old, temporary placeholder cover....and will change soon....-Derek \"Deek\" Diedricksen"},
{"title": "VW bus living- YOUR tiny house/cabin conversion, on the cheap?", "date": "Monday, August 29, 2011", "text": "(First off- MANY of my cabins/things I built are for sale- to fund NEW projects/episodes of \"Tiny Yellow House\"- CLICK HERE!)     Well, I just spent a chunk of last weekend (aside from preparing for the hurricane) in the New Paltz. NY area for weekend #1 of \"The Wolfe's Den\" treehouse installation. While out there, I noticed an inordinate amount of vw buses and campers cruising the back roads- some of them in pristine condition. I even saw a Vanagon for sale- a mere $1200- and as that's something I've wanted to own and convert into micro guest quarters for some time now, I did actually stop to pick through it.     Anyway, off craigslist, here's a non-running model for a mere $850 or bo. Now, some of you may be thinking \"Just what the heck could you do with a hulking wreck like that, Deek!?\"So here's what I would do, so as to make this into a very unique vacation camp in the woods (once I had it towed to wherever after hopefully buying it for less than the asking price- which is very feasible- say, $600).-Repaint it- even if I had to do it the non-pro way and use a glossy house/exterior paint. A REAL paint job would be ideal (costly), but if its just a woods cabin, anything would be an improvement and would help to additionally protect it from the elements. I'd do so after scouring the rust off of the front, of course....-Position it on blocks, or some sort of platform- those tires aren't in great shape and won't hold forever (again, this is for a static cabin, I wouldn't even bother trying to get something like this to run).-Tear out ALL the seats and benches as I can assume they're in bad shape and have been sitting around for ages (You CAN sell these so as to make back some of your purchase price to other vw mini-bus owners and collectors). I'd then bolt in a simple floor frame to level out the contours- and add a layer of light weight, tongue and groove cedar or pine for flooring. Tearing out the front seats would give you MUCH more room for living, sleeping, and hanging out- or you could leave one seat- if you could turn it around and re-install it, as a sort of vehicular lounge chair. -Level out the dashboard's top with nice, poly-coated piece of wood for shelving. -Recoat or paint the roof to prevent leaks and to make it look less awful. If the roof had too many problems, you could bolt on a simple gable frame with corrugated roofing over it, or build it around the van, in a picnic-canopy manner (4 posts and a roof- a structure which you could later screen in). -Install (safety pending) a tiny cast-iron or sheet metal (thick gauge) tent woodstove- again, assuming I could add some fire walls and do so SAFELY.- Add a tiny, tiny solar panel to the roof for lighting.-Build a tiny deck off of the front- and keep in mind if the vehicle were anchored, you could remove the large side door and even build a foyer (or additional living space) off the side of this down the road.Basically, I'd leave the shell intact for the most part, but remove almost everything- steering wheel too, from the interior so as to give such a small space a more wide-open feel. You could then position a new boxed-frame bed (with MUCH storage underneath), and add system of simple/narrow shelves against one side. Keep in mind (perhaps you have to leave this one wheels) that as this would be classified as a vehicle or camper in some counties, you might be able to circumvent certain cabin building or zoning restrictions- you'd have to look into that.   And there's just the inkling of an idea I've been wanting to try for some time....Yes, my book has this in sketch/plan form- but an idea that uses, or can use. almost ANY junky car shell.-Derek \"Deek\" Diedricksen"},

{"title": "Old School Tools (Fool!)- Back to basics building for YOUR tiny house or vacation cabin in the woods....", "date": "Monday, August 22, 2011", "text": "I recently scored two vintage/antique tools at a flea market mall in Fairfield Maine that I had been looking for online for some time now, mainly because of my love of using these style tools growing up, and more recently (well, almost ten years ago now) from when I first began framing the aerial platform for my own cabin in Northern Vermont, and re-realized their usefulness through simple design. \r\rA small hand drill ($6.00) I found at a flea market \r One of the challenges that tiny house or vacation cabin builders often face is having to build in remote places (the few locales in which land is still somewhat affordable) where in many cases electricity might not be present. Sure, you can bring along a cordless drill, or a rechargeable reciprocating saw and a few batteries, but those will only last you so long if you don't have an electrical outlet to keep replacing them (and they're not cheap)- and here's where these old school gems come in.....Also, for those out there who want to, or need to build off/under the radar, or semi-secretly, these tool are irreplaceable in use and effectiveness. \r\rA two speed manual drill with a brace bar (for your hip, shoulder, stomach)\r      For the pre-drilling of lag screw holes on my cabin (and I mean LOTS of 'em) we used an old fashioned brace and bit. Sadly, these type tools are NOT sold at Home Depot or Lowes, and these days few even know what the heck you're talking about when you mention them by name, but, they're not only damn useful and durable (notice- NO plastic!)- they're SO easy to use. Its tools like these that made my cabin a possibility, in a site (still) with no electricity or running water. I used a borrowed brace and bit at the time too, and now (hence this post) have reacquired a good one on ebay for $20. Heck, another pair of perks is that you actually get a little exercise when you're working AND can also enjoy the day, scenery, and great outdoors, without the sound of some motor-driven power tool screaming in your ear.  As for the tools I picked up recently, another incentive is that I got them for a mere fraction of what they cost brand new (from the few companies that even make them anymore) and since they're antiques, they're all metal, and come from an era when manufacturers actually used quality, long-lasting, parts. I can't tell you how many modern \"improved\" tools I've burned through, in fact, a real high end corded drill of mine (that I LOVED) just recently bought it. Not happy...Other tools I might recommend (some tool/store links for these semi-hard to find items are below). Again, Ebay is a good place to look if you want to go the used route too- which I do encourage. SURFORM- its like a very rough sanding rasp that takes large amounts of material/edging off. These are great if you needs to majorly, and quickly round out some board, deck, or railing edges.BLOCK PANE- great for resizing and shaving doors, planks, or just about any other slab or piece of wood that needs some slight fine tuning. With a sharp blade, these operate very smoothly.DRAWING KNIFE- a dual handle blade that's great for peeling logs (for log cabin building) or even taking the edges of dimensional lumber.  A GOOD SET OF CHISELS- I don't even own a GOOD set myself, but I'm repeatedly amazed/surprised at home many times I've used this tool. From installing locksets to mortise and tenon work, to fending off hungry bears (kidding), you can pick up a so-so (but workable) set for very little.NAILSET- for manually countersinking nail heads (for trim work, flooring, etc).  COPING SAW- for tight curves when sawing, trim work....If you have any advice or recommendations, we'd love to hear 'em!-Derek \"Deek\" Diedricksen"},

(Ken Isaacs)", "date": "Tuesday, August 9, 2011", "text": "Great old school article here from Ken Isaacs (the same tiny housing author of old, I'd assume)....This is from the modern mechanix blog.My wife would DEFINITELY kill me if she came home to find THIS in our living room....still, it is kind of cool....On a larger scale, although not so space efficient, something like this could be built on a larger scale out of coated/treated plywood and used outdoors for a micro house of small vacation camp- heck, even a really unique treehouse. Your Very Own Meditator By KEN ISAACS – PS Design Consultant “I vant to be alone.” When Greta Garbo made her often-quoted remark,  years ago, it may have had a deeper meaning than escape from pursuing  newsmen. Everybody occasionally wants to be alone. We all need privacy  to renew ourselves for the fast pace of modern living. As old as  mankind, this inner need is today more urgent than ever before.Mohandas Gandhi was perhaps this century’s outstanding exponent of  alonenessâ€”of personal meditation. Gandhi’s inspiration came in part  from our own Henry David Thoreau, who fled to the natural solitude of  Walden Pond. And Thoreau was a real soul brother of our western man of  the mountains, naturalist John Muir.But perhaps the best expression of this inner needâ€”the one that moved  me to design the Popular Science Meditatorâ€”comes from the cultural  historian and critic, Lewis Mumford. In his book, The Conduct of Life,  Mumford speculates that, ideally, each of us has two lives: our public  life of daily activityâ€”earning a living, raising a familyâ€”plus a  private life created within our thoughts as we examine and evaluate our  actions.It is Mumford’s contention that if each of us fully realized that  every minute of our lives that “escapes reflection” is gone forever,  we’d make provision for that “second life”â€”provision that would  encourage us to slow down and follow up our day-today pursuits with  regular meditation.Mumford actually anticipated my Meditator design when he called for a  form that would give this second life shape: a specific time and place  for contemplative withdrawalâ€”preferably even a special structure  devoted to the purpose. Inspired by this idea, I designed my Meditator.This project was conceived to make it easier for all of us to satisfy  our need for occasional moments of private contemplation. Enter the  Meditator and surround yourself with the graphics which cover its walls,  and something begins to happen to you almost at once.It’s difficult to predict, but you may find the sensation akin to  that mystical communion with nature that you experience when alone in a  forestâ€”or the sense of peace you feel in an empty cathedral. Or you  may develop sudden insights as you study the picture-fragments of your  worldâ€”and be swept by the conviction that you’re “getting it all  together” at last.Far back into history. For the design of the Meditator, I’ve gone to  the ancient Greeks and borrowed one of the polyhedrons they first  visualizedâ€” the 12-sided dodecahedron, each face of which is a perfect  pentagon. The Pythagoreans called it the “atomic building block of the  Universe.”Although the structure is simple to build, the secret of its  effectiveness lies in the preparation of those graphics inside. You  create them from pictures cut from popular magazines-pictures of any  subjects you wish, but pictures to which you have a strong response. The  random assemblage of such pictures is a technique I developed some  years ago and which Look magazine christened “pholage”â€”a word coined  from “photo” and “collage” (an art work pasted up from scraps).The point of a pholage is to confront the viewer with immediate  access to a far greater variety of visual “information” than he could  obtain by leafing through a magazine, page by page. Many experiments  have proven my theory that such a confrontation expands the  consciousness. The viewer begins to see unique relationships between  seemingly isolated incidents.The experience can be eye-opening; no two people respond the same way  to an identical pholageâ€”and no two people will assemble duplicate  collages from identical materials.The fun, then, in making your personal Meditator, is double: First  you create 11 pholages (only the access panel is left bare), then  discover the unexpected cross-referencing when you wrap yourself in the  assembled panels. Beyond that, you’ll be able to compare responses with  your friends. And when you feel you’ve exhausted the potential of a  given assembly, it’s easy to paste new pictures over the old.I think you’ll be surprised by the new perspectives you’ll get toward  the world about you, and your own part in it. I’ll soon be taking the  Meditator with me (knocked down, it fits into a station wagon or sedan)  on a college lecture tour as part of my demonstration of design  technique. Teachers who have had an advance look at the – Meditator feel  thatâ€”with changeable panelsâ€”it could be utilized in schools as a  teaching environment. [Editor's note: College groups interested in  booking Isaacs to speak should write him in care of Popular Science. ] A  breeze to build. When you go to the lumber yard for the 3/8″ plywood,  see if they’ll saw the 4-by-8 panels in half for you. Four-foot squares  are easier to handle.After you’ve cut all the pentagons as illustrated, clamp them into  two groups of six and lay out the 1/4″ holes along the edges. To bore  these holes accurately, it’s best to use an accessory stand with your  portable drill. The distance from the edge should match the holes in the  corner angles you buy. Spread one of the angles to an accurate 117  degrees, checking with a protractor, then use it as a template for the  other 89.Give all wood parts a coat of enamel undercoat. When this is dry and  smoothed with fine sandpaper, apply a good semigloss enamel finish to  the outside faces and all edges. For a decorative effect, paint adjacent  panels contrasting colors and paint the feet to match or contrast.Applying the pholage. Once you’ve gathered your magazine photos, you  may want to experiment with one of the spray adhesives now on the  marketâ€”although they’re expensive. My own method is simple, and  results in a nice flat adhesion to the undercoated plywood.Mix nonstaining cellulose wallpaper paste slightly heavier than  recommended. Put clean water in a flat pan and pull each picture through  it before applying paste liberally to the back with a soft brush and a  light touch. Use the same brush to put paste on the panel where the  picture will be located. The panel should be leaning against the wall in  a nearly vertical position when you take the picture by the two top  corners and place it.Occasionally ink will run and a clipping must be discarded, but if  you keep that light touch I mentioned, this won’t be frequent. You’ll  find that the two paste-coated surfaces attract each other so a picture  almost places itself. Avoid major wrinkles, but don’t try to shift  clippings much once they adhere.You may be dismayed at the puckered look of just-applied pictures,  but they’ll flatten overnight. The purpose of the wetting is to allow  the paper to shrink to the panel. Experiment on a scrap of plywood to  gain confidence and proficiency before tackling the big pentagons.Assemble with the hardware (all wingnuts go outside) and you’re ready  to crawl in for meditation. You’ll quickly understand what Garbo meant  and why Mumford championed the second life of contemplation. -Derek \"Deek\" Diedricksen"},
{"title": "A Return To Walden Pond/Woods and the REAL/old site of the Henry David Thoreau (H.D.) Cabin/tiny house", "date": "Monday, August 8, 2011", "text": "A photo I snapped at the Walden Woods Cabin Ruins-Site. The rocks shown are not the ruins of the cabin itself, but a accumulated pile of tribute rocks left by visitors to this far end of the pond \rNEW VIDEO COMING SOON.... I swung by Walden Woods again (third time this year- just out of convenient/lucky proximity) about two months back and shot some more footage- a \"Part 2\" episode of sorts that shows the OLD ruins of where his actual cabin once stood. Its an ad-hoc flip camera episode, but works well enough, and shows the rock cairn/tribute pile, the bean field and its stone marker, the locale of his wood shed, the cabins fireplace markers/base, and various other sites you might \"recognize\" if you've read the book.    Honestly, while I'm certainly a fan of Thoreau's work, and more so his influence, as well as the path he blazed to a certain degree, I liked his book \"The Maine Woods\" FAR more than \"Walden\" as its more of an adventure novel. That's just me though....although I do know several others who feel the same way. Again too- looks like I might be doing a tiny housing speaking segment, with other guests at Walden Woods on September 10th (tentative date)- if/when I get more details I will let you know. The author of \"Living At The End Of Time\" is also going to be part of this, and his novel (which I'm now reading) is just plain great- on many levels. John Hanson Mitchell's book, in which he builds his own back-to-basics Victorian cottage in the woods, takes place a mere 16 miles from Walden Pond. Mitchell offers a HUGE amount of insight, and expertise, as to Thoreau's works, mindset, and upbringing- a large deal of information I was previously unaware of. But \"Living At The End Of Time\" is HIS OWN tale of backwoods living and self-discovery as well- all penned in an eloquent, yet unhaughty and unpretentious style- with great side-journeys, excursions into his woods, naturalistic sightings, and even ghost stories, galore. Sadly, it appears to be out of print, but you can pick it up TOO cheaply online a few places. I got my copy for $0.01 (well, with $3.00 shipping or so)! I'm not joking. Its criminal, considering how much I've enjoyed this book. -Derek \"Deek\" Diedricksen-Derek \"Deek\" DiedricksenAnother VERY ROUGH DRAFT for what might be a future tiny shelter/house/sleeper/emergency-hut design, or something I just may build perhaps for my \"Tiny Yellow House\" show on youtube. Pretty self-explanatory and \"FUN\"ctional (at least I feel so). The \"Alligator\" aspect of it is just for amusement/art's sake. This little dwelling could be built pretty affordably and could house the homeless, or in larger form, serve as a one person emergency shelter/hut/tiny house.Why not?An initial prototype could easily be built from plywood and would feature a window in the end, a micro-circular \"eye\" window (a recycled washing machine window a la my cabin \"The GottaGiddaWay\"), vents, and a hydraulic/piston-style hinge to prevent the top from slamming down shut while entering the sleep chamber. It could be locked from the inside too (perhaps)- depending on the neighborhood.I even went so far as the contemplate a few emergency stab-tabs on the \"ceiling\" in case a few punks decided they wanted to sit on top of this and not let the occupant out. In such a case, a sharp, pencil like metal rod could be shoved upwards through the hole or two, effectively stabbing the sitters in the arse, and giving them no choice but to move. Naturally, this could be misused and abused by those with less than good intentions during the daytime too. So perhaps its not a great idea.  AGAIN- a ROUGH DRAFT(!)- this is not what the drawings in my book look like....(which just got mention in Australia's \"SANCTUARY\" magazine, and soon in \"South Shore Living\" magazine, in a follow-up to the Boston Globe cover-story we had. The book's not even out yet (on pre-order) and its been selling VERY well- thank you! Thank you! I spent years making the art and designs in the book so I completely appreciate those who have supported me by picking up a copy. -Derek \"Deek\" Diedricksen"},
{"title": "Another sneak peek at \"The Krunk Bunk\" (For Sale)- a space saving, micro-loft sleeper/legless \"bunk\" bed", "date": "Sunday, August 7, 2011", "text": "We shot yet another video for Make Magazine (a \"Tiny Yellow House\" episode) this past friday (with Mike Amato of Jodom Pictures/Modern Vintage Productions), and things went really well. We hope to have that video out later this month, once we chop the heck out of it.     In the meantime, I did some more painting, re-arranging, and decorating with this little sleep/work/escape pod (that HANGS from a ceiling), and I'm pretty \"dang\" happy with the results. Something like this would be perfect for high-ceilinged city apartments, college dorms, or any other tiny spaces, homes, or dwellings.Sadly, as my own house is small, I can't keep this one, as much as I'd like to, so it'll either be auctioned off on ebay after the video airs, or will be for sale to anyone interested in the meantime I suppose....(kidcedar at gmail dot com). $600 obo?

Check out his facebook page HERE- he updates it almost DAILY, with NEW, DAILY artwork....the man's a work horse! The other bulletin board of art actually contains a few BRAND NEW cabin sketches and designs of my own that we haven't shown yet (I've been using The Krunk Bunk as a sketching space)- some of which will be in the NEW edition of my book (as always, you can pre-order it at the link below)- 50+ cabin designs and tiny house concepts.

{"title": "Space efficient chairs/seating for your tiny home, converted shed, or vacation cottage....", "date": "Thursday, August 4, 2011", "text": "Chairs and seating always seem to be an issue when designing, or living in a very small home, and while on a recent shopping spree of sorts over at Ikea for accessories and decorative props for our next \"Tiny Yellow House\" episode shoot (tomorrow), I came across a hanging chair (one of many they carry) called the EKORRE- which was reasonably priced too. The only thing I missed was that another package/part (the inflatable pad for the seat- about $10.00) has to be purchased seperately- I don't really think its needed though, especially for adult use, leaving you more sitting room as a result. Its more so meant for kids, it seems, as it was in the \"kids section\", but it does hold up to 220 pounds and has enough sitting room for an adult, so WHY NOT? I just better not \"let-go\" and lay on the lbs. anytime soon, or there goes my chair swinging days....Anyway, I grabbed one, and am in the process of installing it in my basement to serve as an eventual segue into another Make Magazine shoot on homemade hanging seating, and I'll let you know how it works out down the road....The thing does look pretty darn durable, I do have to say, and when not in use, you could unhook it and ball it up into something as small as a coffee can, perhaps, to store it.Naturally, on the cheap, here are some other small-space seating ideas....-Hammocks (take them down when not in use, and they can double as short-term sleep spaces)-Hanging Butterfly-style chairs-Thin metal folding chairs-Stackables-Ottomans or side tables that double as storage and seating-Custom-built wall fold-out/drop down seats-Stairs (a low, increased-size tread or two) that can accomodate a kiester as well  And you get the idea....foldable and stowable is the key ingredient for your small house, vacation hut, cabin, cottage, shack. or shedworking/granny flat.Ikea's chair, the PS SVINGA also looked intriguing too, nicer/more adult looking, but more expensive and it wouldn't really pack away, or tie back against a wall when not in use. These would probably work great on a porch or deck though.  -Derek \"Deek\" Diedricksen"},

{"title": "The Top Ten Best Tiny House/Small Home/Little Living/Micro-Architecture Books", "date": "Tuesday, August 2, 2011", "text": "If tiny homes, vacation cabins, shacks, shanties, huts, forts, treehouses/treehomes, shantyboats, houseboats, and small living in general is your thing....here's my personal list of the TOP TEN books (in my opinion) on the subject of small architecture and handbuilt homes. I own a TON of these style books, and have read EVEN MORE of 'em, so it was VERY hard to come up with this list. Also, over time, its tough to remember how much I liked certain books, and how influential they might have been- when so much time has passed, and now that I look at them in a different light. These are in no particular order...And.... I've included my own book (but still give you TEN others) as literally, its EXACTLY what I dig in tiny housing, and stands as a long-built culmination of all my own inspirations, influences, and nods to bits and parts from the books I loved, and read, while growing up.....so, yeah, it definitely is in my top ten, as it represents everything I like in tiny housing and designs.  So....Deek's/Relaxshacks.com's TOP TEN Tiny House/Cabin/Vacation Cottage/Micro-Architecture Books....(well, again, ELEVEN).This (out Feb, 1- 2012- but out for pre-order for a REALLY low price (Ouch!)) is the EXPANDED, and updated version of my still-available hand-assembled book (order via this blog- right hand column). The new edition will have several new cabin ideas, designs, and sketches, TWO color photo insert sections, a new chapter on small space design tricks from interviews I've done with Dee Williams, Kent Griswold, Duo Dickinson, Jay Shafer, Mimi Zeiger, Cathy Johnson, Alex Pino, Gregory Johnson, Tammy Strobel, Amanda Kovattana, Colin Beaven, (and more), a ton of new micro cartoons and additive/example sketches, a brand new intro/foreword by David and Jeanie Stiles, and then some. All in all, the book gives close to FIFTY cabin ideas and concepts to get your creative juices flowing.     The \"OLD\"/current version of the book DOES have about 5-6 designs in it that won't be in the new book, and won't ever see the light of day again- so order the hand-assembled one while I have 'em- they all come signed too. As for the rest of 'em....Lester Walker's \"Tiny Houses\" (which has been reprinted with other alternate names since) was the first book I remember getting (a gift from my father, Glenn, for my 10th birthday). Being a fort-obsessed kid, from there on out it was pure addiction- and this book STILL is one of my favorites. \"Tiny Houses\" has many detailed sketches, a good history on many of the designs, and two of my favorite tiny houses- ever- Jeff Milstein's \"The Bolt-Together House\" and Lester's own \"The Vacation Cube\"- an 8' by 8' prefabricated cabin. This book is REALLY thorough, as well as fun, David and Jeanie Stiles are an author/architect duo from NYC who have put out a slew of books on the tiny architecture subject over the years (and I do recommend ANY of them), but \"Cabins\" (with \"Rustic Retreats in a close second) is my favorite of them all. The sketches are incredible, the ideas very solid, and it'll take a heck of a long time before you're bored perusing through this one. David and Jeanie have actually written a new intro to MY book- certainly an honor, as I think very highly of the two of them and their body of work. I can't speak highly enough of David's pen sketching style- very D.C. Beard, but with a fun, faster, more lighthearted feel. A virtual feast of funky photos, hand-built homes, and hippied-out, ultra-creative dwellings, all in a hugely eclectic, and seemingly random manor- making each page turn unpredictable in its content. This book is just LOADED with color photos, and visual snippets from other books, architects, designers, and \"off-gridders\".The HUGE color insert/centerfold photos of a recycled glass cave/dwelling, are art in and of themselves- just gorgeous. From stone homes to huts fashioned from re-purposed scraps and auto parts, this one has a little of everything. Like David and Jeanie Stiles, Lloyd's other books are pretty unbelievable as well- \"Shelter\" would be a close second of mine to \"Homework\" and its his best-selling work to date- with far over 300,000 copies having been independently moved.\"The Barefoot Architect\" is also phenomenal- put out by Lloyd's \"Shelter Publications\". Support the man. Dan Price's \"Radical Simplicity\" is probably the most offbeat, and fun entry in my top ten. Its presented in journal form, and not so much a cabin how-to, or carpentry tutorial book- actually its NOT at all. Throughout Dan's entries and his myriad of ultra-unique pen sketches, you gain insight, both in prose and in sketch, as to a large variety of the shelters Dan has built, lived in, and run his micro-publishing business from. Teepees, log huts, and underground kivas! (oh my!). Price's ideas and drawings are very quirky and unusual- one of the reasons I'm so fond of this little book. File under: Start Saving Your Money! Most of these cabins (and locales) are exclusively for the mega-rich and elite, BUT there's no denying the appeal that is within most of them, nor some of their unique approaches, concepts, and constructive ideas- which are ripe for re-adaptation to suit your own needs (on a more sensible budget, perhaps). Visually, its an absolutely beautiful book, and Mulfinger, a Minnesota-based architect, is not only passionate about the field of vacation cabins and camps, but damn knowledgeable. Not all the cabins within are so modest in size, some even bordering on semi-monstrous, but there are many, many gems within, and this one is well worth the coin for tiny house and cabin daydreamers and addicts alike. Dan also comes across as a very likeable guy you could sit down and have a few beers with- despite his being a very notable and successful author and architect.\"The Getaway Home\", and \"Cabinology\" by Mulfinger, are both very noteworthy additions to the subject as well. \"Micro\", much like \"Small Houses\" (below) has some of the more bizarre, and in some cases most illogical and artsy cabins and shelters I've seen- but even the \"bad ideas\" in this one are thought provoking and really serve to stretch the imaginative boundaries of form in function in scaled down living. A huge, and very stunning array of photos reside in this one- so its more of an eye-candy book- light on the text, but still BIG on ideas and open-mindedness.This is another one of the earlier books I had access to while growing up, and whether it be the hexagonal ski chalet with fold-down bunks, the micro cook-camp/sleeper, or the vacation cabin that spins to follow the southern sky (by means of a small motor and chain-driven system), I still find myself returning to this book from time to time- just to browse, and soak up all these wonderful, 1970s-looking locales, scenes, and design ideas- many of which are still VERY workable today. \"Shantyboat\" is a book I discovered by accident a few years ago, and devoured. Afterwards, I immediately set upon finding and reading every other book that Harlan (and Anna) Hubbard had written (sadly, only three, really). There are few pictures in this (printed woodcuttings of Harlan's), its a novel on the travel adventures of two daring souls, and its a fairly lengthy text-based read, but if tiny housing on the water (shantyboating, or houseboats) is your thing, you'll want to build one right after reading this book. Harlan and Anna, at the age of 50 or so (if my memory serves me correct) built a shantyboat from scrounged river wood and materials, and without the aid of a motor, proceeded to drift down the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers, all the way to the Gulf Of Mexico- over a period of several years. The tidbits of knowledge and discovery in this book are just priceless. The duos eventual homestead (later a book under the same title as well) \"Payne Hollow\" is on my list of MUST SEE places before I croak. ALL of their books are VERY worthwhile. See the above read on \"Micro\"- these two books are rather similar in style, size, and photographic array, and both cover the more sparse and modern angle/side of tiny architecture. Photos galore!  Being a Boy Scout (Eagle Scout), I've grown up with D.C. Beard's timeless instructional sketches, and his just-plain-amazing pen and ink style of art and architecture. \"Shelters, Shacks, and Shanties\" is for the very earthy and old-fashioned sorts out there- showing several very bare-bone renditions of shelter the way it was made back in the days of our country's pioneers. Log cabins, lean-tos, teepees, wigwams/hogans- they're all in here- and most can be made with little more than an axe and a saw.---------------------------------------- Runner Ups....we'll get to those in another post at some point- but Mimi Zeiger's Micro Green is certainly one of them, and one of the few VERY newer books that I've really been impressed with.-Derek \"Deek\" Diedricksen"},

FIFTY MORE) are in my book \"Humble Homes, Simple Shacks\"- which you can order BELOW- or in either side column of this blog..That said... I'm fascinated with car and van dwelling and love reading about the whole mobile living sub-culture....I've slept in MANY a car and van (especially when touring with bands when I was younger) and while I did it the \"wrong, unplanned, and unorganized\" way, by comparison to seasoned vets, there STILL was such a sense of adventure to it- hopping fences to illegally use hotel pools (a substitute for bathing), overnighting in motel parking lots, sleeping behind gas stations, and you name it....Anyway, I'm also enamored with the mighty \"El Camino\"- and for years have been wanting to convert one into a redneck road camper....and while I haven't done so, YET, here are a few very cool camper-versions of this classic automobile. The Ford Ranchero (Ford's version of the El Camino) also would make a great/same-style tiny road house conversion.  This one is actually a tiny scale model! -Derek \"Deek\" Diedricksen"},

The interior metal of a coffee can serves as a no-budget, curved reflector for the light, and as a wind housing, preventing it from easily going out.My new book has a semi-similar idea- using coffee cans and wall mounting them to hold candles (in a safe manor) for light in ones tiny home, cabin, or vacation camp (or even for emergency use). You can do the same with glass jars, so long as they're vented and angled in a manor that doesn't collect carbon/soot. At least one of Lloyd's book through Shelter Publications WILL be in my upcoming blog post and video for my \"Top Ten Tiny House/Small Living/Micro Architecture Books\"- which I'll be working on real soon....-Derek \"Deek\" Diedricksen"},
{"title": "The SKINNIEST home in the world? A high-tech, tiny, alleyway house in Poland (photo gallery)", "date": "Wednesday, July 27, 2011", "text": "This one has been posted in our facebook group (thanks to Sam Brelsfoard), and has been kickin' around alot lately, and while I personally wouldn't want to live in something so cold, sterile, narrow, and angular- the idea, and execution, in an art-sense, is pretty amazing. I don't see how the heck building something like this would be allowed in a city, but then again, I'm not so up to date on my Polish Building codes these days! (There's a joke in there somewhere (and I'm a tiny part Polish, for the record)).This super skinny house by Polish architects Centrala proves that practically any space can be transformed into a habitable residence.  Set along a narrow alleyway,  Keret House will be the narrowest residence in Warsaw, if not the  world. The triangle-shaped house will span three levels, suspended  between two existing buildings above the alley below. The slim pod-like  building will repurpose a derelict space that seemed to serve as a  local dump – the alley was packed with old furniture, trash bags and  graffiti.  The three levels are built from a steel frame covered with  inexpensive plywood, and panels made from Styrofoam  and concrete cloth form the structure’s spaceship-like exterior.  Visitors even “board” the vessel through a set of remote control stairs,  which open and extend to the alley below and then fold into the floor.Electricity will be provided by a neighboring host building,  and a water and sewage system in the small space will be free-standing,  much like systems used on boats. The first floor of the living space is  a work space and a lounge. The second level, reachable by ladder, fits a sleeping loft with a skylight. The top space can be used for storage.Part art installation, part workspace, the house was designed as a  studio for Israeli writer, Etgar Keret.  The creative space will also be  open to visiting artists and writers, and hopefully it will to incite inspiration through its design. Construction is slated to begin in September.+ CentralaVia Arch Daily  -Derek \"Deek\" Diedricksen"},

Oh yeah- July 29th- 7:30 on CBS (Boston Area- WCVB)- a show called \"Chronicle HD\" will also be re-airing a piece on the structures I build, design, and write on- called \"Eye Candy\"- it was REALLY fun and well done!  You can grab the book on pre-order at a very, very discounted price...if you don't mind waiting for it. I TRULY make JACK on each copy, but its good to know that enough interest in the book will allow me to put out another entirely new book down the road (which is already pretty much finished).

PLEASE don't buy this place for the land and tear down the cabin!)Well, one of the reasons I hesitated on posting these photos and this info, is because the cabin in this blog post was actually recently for sale, and Dustin, Dawn (my brother and my sister-in-law) and I were actually contemplating buying it so that we could shoot a documentary film on it, and occasionally use it. The price (and its WATERFRONT, ON an island in New Brunswick)- a mere $18,000.00. The ultimate reason on us passing and making an offer was that it was just too far away- AND we already have our off-grid cabin in Vermont (See \"Tiny Yellow House: Vermont Cabin\" episode on youtube).A shot of the micro-loftTHIS is definitely one of my favorite cabin designs and concepts- and it ties right into the Lester Walker book (link below) which was my FIRST tiny housing book I was gifted at age 10- back in the mid eighties. I STILL haven't tired of this book, and as I've slowly been piecing together a \"Deek's Top 15/20 Tiny House Design Books\" for an eventual post here, Walker's book will easily be in my top five. Again, check it out below....Lester's book has some schematics and measurements/multi-views of how to construct this simple cabin.  Exterior- overall length is just 16'- (four sheets of plywood/T-111)Dustin \"Dr. Demolition\" Diedricksen actually had a chance to step inside this place on his way to Nova Scotia a few weekends back and has quite a bit of footage he filmed showing the interior, exterior, and surrounding landscape of this cool little cabin. Once he gets it edited down, we'll toss it up on my relaxshacksDOTcom youtube channel. The History on this cabin design- Architect Jeff Milstein came up with the pre-fabricated concept of this vacation house (in 1972, which could be fully built for $2500.00), and released the idea through Family Circle Magazine- it not only became a huge hit, even with a cult-following to this very day, but still stands as THE best selling blueprints that the magazine ever carried- selling out its 25,000 copies. And my book (above- Lester Walker gave me a very positive write-up/review on it as well- which didn't suck).  -Derek \"Deek\" DiedricksenLots goin' on here at the \"Relaxshacks.com Camp\"- as usual....(AND NEW photos of an unseen build are below- its NOT finished though- so I'm unsure as to whether or not I should have posted anything yet...too late...). \"The Little Blue Bump\"- a micro-escape/single sleeper cabin (to be placed in the shade, or if not, roofed in WHITE poly panels) that we built at the workshop. This IS NOT done- and the paint and windows are all additions I personally added after the workshop concluded (the photos below). Still a ways to go on this one. The attendees did a great job on this (based on a sketch I handed 'em). This will have a tiny front deck, solar lights, interior paint, flooring, and more- ultimately. I've added FOUR makeshift \"windows\" to it so far....The rear-side- at the conclusion of the workshop day (14 hours of speakers, cabin tours, building, eating, and demonstrations). \"The Simple Shell\" is/was another name for this easy-to-build (and afford), plywood disaster relief, or homeless shelter. Dustin's (my brother) group came up with this scrap material door, complete with a cut-wine-bottle knob, a \"chinese star\" door latch, and the use of some scrap aluminum screening I had from my radiator cover-building days. Some scrap wood was worked into the mix too. A close-up of the rear window....which utilizes a sash/glass pane that we grabbed from a dump (while at the Cape Cod Eco-fest).  Also, I just spent a very late/long night dropping some new vocals on a song my band wrote (Age Against The Machine/Anklelock) and recorded called \"Pullit\"- this being a parody \"how-to\" instructional video/version (the lyrics ARE the directions) that we'll soon film a music video for- for Make Magazine- another exclusive edition of \"Tiny Yellow House\".Me, on the mic, over at Media Boss Studio- I look kinda evil in this one.... We recorded over at \"Media Boss\" Studios with Jim Foster from the bands Nullset/White- he also has produced albums and recordings for Godsmack, P.O.D., Gary Cherone (Extreme, Van Halen), and more....the guys REALLY good at what he does.

Now I picked this book up for about $2.00, while staying out in Lincoln, VT (at that blog-aforementioned tiny used book shop (love those places)), and while gazing at the cover of the book, which I thought I had never heard of, somewhere deep in my memory, I completely remembered the cover-art from middle school books fairs. I also recall assuming the book was about wizardry, or had a medieval slant, as judged by the cover art- but no....This little \"easy-reader\" was penned by Jean Craighead George- who was a Newberry Medal recipient (for \"Julie Of The Wolves\"), and \"My Side Of The Mountain\" was a runner-up to the very same award (a different year). The book was originally written in 1959, and has been a HUGE worldwide seller, so most of you might already know of it. It somewhat reminds me of the Gary Paulson HUGE-selling young-adult novel \"Hatchet\"- another one I never read until now- in my 30s. Both are quick, yet pretty phenomenal reads if you're looking for some outdoor adventure, and a \"Get away from it all\" motif.  Anyway, I'm not going to give too many book write-ups afterall, but I HAVE been compiling my list of top ten or fifteen all-time tiny house/alternative shelter buildings, and if any of your readers have any input/suggestions- feel free to add them in the comments section, or on our \"Tiny Yellow House\" small housing club/group.AND...AND (yeah, I gotta mention it, because I killed myself creating it, AND would love for it to do well enough for the LYONS PRESS to sign me to a follow-up design book......only $11.53 right now- damn cheap.... -Derek \"Deek\" Diedricksen"},

Honestly and simply- and it ties right into another part of today's ramblings- one of the things we DON'T have in our household is cable tv, and the lack of that temptation has freed up quite a bit of my time both day and nights.    Beyond that, we recently purchased a Vizio flat screen tv so as to gain some needed space in our modest/small home (small by US standards- four of us, and a huge dog, in approx. 1000 square feet or so- and lovin' it), and after mere months, the thing has crapped out (a recurring problem with their sets apparently). In the meantime, while we're wrestling with the warranty, the botched service jobs, and lousy customer service, we now haven't had tv AT ALL for almost a month now. Honestly, by day three I stopped instinctively reaching to turn it on while eating a bowl of cereal, or working on my blog, but beyond that, while already a total bookworm, I've not only had more time for reading and sketching, but for many other things as well. Ultimately, family-wise, the tv will be back, but I have to say, through this little unintentional experiment (and given that its something I've been wanting to kick for awhile), I can't say I'm in a rush to get the ole beast back. I do miss PBS and Create though...Here's a few of the random things I've done recently, when I would have been watching re-runs of \"Green Acres\" instead....and its with little changes like this, that you might be able to find more time to plot YOUR next project, or future tiny home.

So yeah, I guess I've been kinda busy.....That said- the ONE single non-hand-sketched offering in the book (later to be available as plans) is something that I designed called \"The Odd Pod\"- and with the help of the ever-awesome Shelton Davis from Repurposedgoods.com, we tweaked this design to look pretty dang slick. What you see is only an early, rough incarnation of the shelter- and not what its going to look like in the book. The final design is far different than this, but with the same general idea....a mini cabin with a sleep loft, that doubles as a roof over a porch/work-space area- and one that could later be screened in, or enclosed for more living room.

The tarp roof twisted around the tree trunk (to better seal out the rain) is an interesting/affordable approach I haven't seen before, and the rear window of this structure also has a cookie/baking cooling rack that serves as its barrier/grate. A clubhouse like this is designed in size and scope for children, but again, there are always so many design elements that carry over from that world, into the one of tiny houses and homes, so I feel these structures are always worth a look and mention. Heck, I just may have to knock on this person's door someday to see if I can shoot a tiny little video on this fort for youtube- we'll see...    As for the interior, I really couldn't see much of it from the side road where I took these photos, but I could see a few tiny folding chairs inside. and what looked like frisbies horizontally attached to the tree to serve as shelving- another first.

It would be best suited in a high-ceiling environment, but we placed it here for the sake of demonstration- in a setting not perfectly ideal (but it was all we had for space in my small home).     THIS is also ONE of two structures we built as groups two days ago in our workshop- 14 HOURS LONG- man, were we all tired by the end.

I personally had a great time too, and there was a great wealth of ideas, and background/experienced-information being passed around all day. We will have another down the road. In the meantime, check out the other photos. PS- Alex Pino, from Tinyhousetalk.com was THE FIRST to test out The Krunk Bunk- and spent a night in it, in fact.... One other student, Forest Zoll, our youngest, spent the night in The Gypsy Junker, as well- and loved it. Mariah Coz, and other workshop attendees plotting and cutting the shell's shelves and windows...Alex Pino, adding window trim to The Krunk Bunk....This photo is a little deceiving- its taken from my micro closet office (\"cloffice\"). The side of the bunk is about 6-7 feet away, but in this photo it appears to block any exit from the office!  AGAIN, More photos (of Project #2)- coming soon. And again, thanks to all who attended the workshop!Soonish- since I just don't have the room to keep it, The Krunk Bunk will be up for sale. Proceeds will simply go towards shooting more how-to/educational videos for our show \"Tiny Yellow House\"- and paying for materials to build those new structures.If interested- kidcedar at gmail dot com. Again, my NEW, EXPANDED (new designs, color photos, guest contributors) edition of my tiny house/home/space design book \"Humble Homes, Simple Shacks\" is out at a discounted pre-order price right now....just click on the link above. Its only $11.53 (a random price, I know...). A few, older, signed, hand-assembled, copies of the book are still for sale in the right hand column of this site too- those have several designs that WILL NOT be in the new edition.

Containers such as these (used) can be purchased and delivered for as little as $2000, if you shop around.    I always thought a container in a remote area would be ideal- they're more or less bullet-proof, and burglar proof (when initially constructing them (no windows), and if building a vacation cabin away from home, you can simply leave your tools and materials locked-up within for extended periods of time when you're away.

So, sometime after July, I'll have it up and available again- as I have about 200 or so dusty copies I just never got around to doing anything with.I might consider releasing it in e-zine/e-book form too....but I have to work on that.  I'm going to work out a portion of the proceeds to some soon-to-be-named charity too.....or perhaps towards the funding of a few of those micro-homeless huts/shelters I've been talking about.\"THE U.B. 30 Treehouse\"- which we built only recently- is, idea-wise, from one of the sketches in this book....Here's its video tour...-Derek \"Deek\" Diedricksen"},
{"title": "A Teenage Treehouse-Dweller: Cameron Shorb from Lincoln, MA", "date": "Friday, June 10, 2011", "text": "\"TREETOP TINY HOUSING\" (Join our facebook group for MUCH more on tiny houses, thrift construction, and small living- HERE)     I stumbled upon this article (below), and contacted this \"whippersnapper\" immediately after- and long-story short, this weekend I'm headin' out to hang with 18-year old Cameron Shorb, a guy who has now been living in a treehouse for well over a year- through the winter and all....which certainly takes some cajones! So....new micro-video coming soon....as I'll be touring his place, and asking him a slew of questions related to his treehousin' lifestyle. Lincoln —(from the Lincoln Journal via Wickedlocal.com)- article from two years ago....Cameron Shorb likes trees so much, he sleeps in one year-round.Shorb, 16, had the tree house built next to his house in Lincoln, MA and he spends nearly every night in the unheated 90-square-foot  structure.The tree house has windows without glass. During winter Shorb arms  himself with long underwear, fleece pants and shirt, a wool hat, gloves,  wool socks, a sleeping bag, and down quilt to fight off the cold.“There are definitely winter mornings where I’ll wake up and I’ll have  spent the night with my head buried inside my sleeping bag and when I  wake up there’s a layer of frost from where my breath was getting out.  Often times the snow will drift in and cover the lower half of my bed or  all of it, just a light layer,” said Shorb.The only force of nature that drives him out of the tree house is  thunderstorms. He said that they are “hard to ignore” and “sometimes  make me feel like I’m going to die.” His will has broken down a couple  of times during thunderstorms and he has moved inside.His love for the outdoors began 6 years ago when Shorb’s family lived  in New Jersey. Shorb went to a wilderness camp called the Eagle  Wilderness Adventures in Vermont where everyone slept in teepees. When  he returned home he had trouble adjusting to living and sleeping in the  house. When Shorb’s family moved to Lincoln, he slept in a tent at one  point and then moved to the screened-in porch at another point. When  Shorb’s parents were renovating the house, they decided to build the  tree house.“I am incredibly lucky. I am just so thankful for this opportunity,” said Shorb.So why does he put himself through all these hardships?“It’s also about learning my place in nature,” said Shorb. He wants to  feel the heat and the cold and learn not to be bothered by it. “That  connection to nature is so valuable to me.”Despite the hardships of trying to acclimate to nature and its seasons,  Shorb finds great joy in living in nature even during the winter.“When you wake up and the first snow of the winter has fallen over  night and everything is just white and dazzling and beautiful and fresh  and you can smell it and you can taste the snow and the air, then it’s  all worth it,” said Shorb. “That’s such a magical feeling and definitely  one of my very favorite parts of living in a tree house.”Shorb has also had close encounters with nature that people normally do  not experience. He woke up one morning and “there was a distinct feel  of two clawed feet and a beak pulling at my hair.” It was a titmouse  looking for material to build its nest and it found Shorb’s hair.Read more: Lincoln student sleeps in tree house year-round - Lincoln, MA - Lincoln Journal http://www.wickedlocal.com/lincoln/archive/x1311828573/Lincoln-student-sleeps-in-tree-house-year-round#ixzz1OsP2lR57------Derek \"Deek\" Diedricksen"},

This one was built for kids, obviously, but does it HAVE to be for kids? Hells no! I also especially dig this micro loft's use (and repainting) of a simple wooden step  ladder- which would work great in many tiny house and cabin applications  (and these can be found at tag/yard sales all the time for close to  nothing). I've built staircases and galley stairways alike, and they're always somewhat of a pain in the ass. With this yardsale ladder usage, it a no-time-spent project for the most part, except for the paint.

A few weekends ago, while I had my micro cabin \"The GottaGiddaWay\" (see the video tour below) on the road for the Wellfleet, MA Cape Cod Eco Fest (thanks to Lydia Vivante for the invite, and ChezSven.com Bnb for a gorgeous place to stay!), I was able to snap some photos (which will be laid out over several posts) to show just how amazing, especially in terms of micro-architecture, Cape Cod is. And the food....wow....another whole story.....Anyway, I can find very little on these Eastham, MA camps/cottages (right on route 6), but I did find out that online many artists have painted them in the past. The future of this motorcourt dubbed \"Tilted Acres Campground/Cabins\" is also uncertain from what I've read. Whatever the case, I HAD to stop the car, turnaround, and snap a few photos...and again, MANY more from others towns, while I'll post over time... THE PLAN: After seeing how incredible the Cape is, in terms of tiny houses (and more!)- we're slowly trying to raise sufficient funds to shoot a mini-film/episode of my program \"Tiny Yellow House\" about a trek out to The Cape Cod Dune Shacks in Provincetown, MA- showing many of the amazing sights, cabins, cottages, indie art galleries, and attractions along the way. We're aiming to tackle something like this late in the summer, meaning, we need to haul arse NOW to get things ready and squared away, and to line up rental equipment, a mini crew, etc. If YOU might be interested in backing us, in exchange for exposure in this episode (ie a pbs style thanks ad in the beginning of the film), please contact me at kidcedar at gmail dot com. The end product will be quality- as have been our videos that have been covered/featured in the NY Times, Seattle Times, PBS, NPR, CBS News, Chronicle HD on ABC, The Boston Globe, Treehugger.com, Tinyhouseblog.com, and beyond.We'd love your help and support- or budget isn't huge, but too large for my own wallet alone, as these shoots get costly, especially with a crew of helpers away from home- equipment, lodging, meals, gas, and the list goes on. With any excess beyond our budget, we'd like to film a thing or two, we have planned, in Brooklyn at some point too.-Derek \"Deek\" DiedricksenHere's our latest film on a micro-homeless hut I built and designed- which yes, is purposefully goofy- don't worry, the Cape Cod project will be much more straight-laced...."},

Sparse, Simple, Spacious (in only 800 square feet), and most of all, FUN!  \"CAMPING OUT AT HOME\"Terri Chiao has cabin fever. But instead of itching to get out of the  house, she equipped her Brooklyn loft with all it needs to ease her  malady. The approximately 800-square-foot space is loc-ated within a  former textile factory in Bushwick, an industrial neighborhood with a  burgeoning art and food scene. It was completely raw and open, and it  badly needed two bedrooms to make it livable. Chiao, who graduated from  Columbia University in 2008 with an architecture degree, wasn’t content  to simply construct square Sheetrock walls. In formulating her cure-all,  she turned to two major design influences: Atelier Bow-Wow, a Japanese  architecture firm known for tiny houses, and the many weekends she spent  as a child in the mountains of North Georgia and Tennessee. The result?  Two inspired hut-like hallucinations ready to become reality.Chiao spent a sweaty summer of 2009 building (with a whole team of  friends) the two small spaces within the loft. Each one is outfitted  with just enough storage and privacy for one person. “The nice thing  about building a house for yourself is that it really is a house for  yourself,” she says. Her room, an 88-square-foot cabin, is an iconic  pitched-roof shelter made out of luan plywood and standard lumber.  Though spartan—it fits little more than a double bed—there are  picturesque windows to capture the southeastern light that floods the  loft during the day. Her roommate sleeps in a 100-square-foot plywood  “treehouse” raised 6 feet off the floor to accommodate a study and  storage area underneath.In between the two structures, a shared living room is filled with  books and plants. Chiao uses the 12-foot-tall shared space for casual  dinner parties, movie nights, and artist salons. “I like feeling  connected to the weather, and, in this space, the sun and the sky can be  experienced directly at all times through the big windows—so sometimes  it does feel a little bit like I’m living outdoors,” she explains.  “Maybe as close as I can get to doing that comfortably in New York City,  anyway.” And the loft, and its occupants, are so much better off for  it.MORE INFO and HOW-TO at  http://www.readymade.com/magazine/article/camping_out_at_home-Derek \"Deek\" Diedricksen (via (article and photos) www.readymade.com )"},

{"title": "A tiny mosaic-dome guest house shaped like a woman in a dress!?", "date": "Thursday, June 2, 2011", "text": "I saw this a ways back on Michael Janzen's site, and just had to share- talk about a WILD guest house!The write-up below is by Michael Janzen as well....Just when you think you’ve seen it all, there’s always something  better. Here’s a unique house that will probably never be duplicated –  but possibly emulated.This 18-foot tall dome home was built by artist Bev Magennis. It’s  located in remote Apache Creek, New Mexico and serves as a tiny guest  space on a larger 10-arce homestead. The entire exterior is covered with  mosaic ceramic tile – Bev’s medium of choice for many years. The form  is similar to another sculpture series she calls her Garden Ladies.Tiling large mosaics from broken scrap tile is incredibly slow going  and tedious. Having spent some time outside in the sun laying tiny tiles  I know this house must have taken hundreds of hours and thousands of  tiles to complete. But Bev has the patience of a saint and prey drive  like no one I know, so for her I’m sure it was just a lot of fun – and  something she had to do.The structure of the tiny house is as unique as the design itself. A  circular 12-foot diameter concrete footing was poured with  rebar-reinforced PVC pipe inserted vertically every three feet. The pipe  was then gathered together at the top to form the basic dome shape.  Then the dome was lathed and plastered on the inside and out before the  tile was applied.I’m pretty sure most of the experienced builders reading the  description of how this house was built just cringed. It’s an incredibly  unconventional approach, but it sure seems to have worked.Knowing Bev, a true rebel and experimenter, I doubt if she asked for  permission to built it or had an engineer review the design. But I also  suspect it’s perfectly safe.I remember asking her 20 years ago if she had to get any special permits to tile her big  house in Albuquerque (see photo below) or to store a field of tile  scraps in her backyard – she just smiled a mischievous smile and said…  no (innocently).There were volumes of lessons in that grin and single word answer.---------Michael Janzen runs Tinyhousedesign-Derek \"Deek\" Diedricksen"},

Here's the prefab- build n' drag treehouse I built for my brother Dustin, as a surprise for his 30th birthday up in the woods of VT on our 10 acre camp. I built the structure in a single day back at my home in Massachusetts, and then carted the pieces four hours north to Vermont, where my cousin Neil and I assembled most of this in a single evening. The total cost was around $250.00 or so, but with some backbreaking work, and with having to haul the materials down a quarter mile of rugged trails- while running a fever (you can hear it in my voice and breathing at times). The supporting cradle/base was made from pressure treated wood I found on the ride up- when I spotted someone tearing down their deck and leaving all the wood for the taking/trashing- talk about perfect timing (it saved me at least another $100 or more in wood).Dustin, his wife, and their baby all slept in here during a monstrous storm- and not a single drop of wetness got within. A few funky, $5.00 prints within- and a curbside, recycled window sash. Naturally, like ALL my cabins, i've included a candle-lantern- three actually.

So, finally, here's the loose rough-schedule for our workshop (as always, things are subject to change, and we have to be flexible)..... First Off, JUST ANNOUNCED- EACH attendee will be receiving a copy of \"Compact Cabins\"- a bestselling cabin-plan book from Gerald Rowan! Its a $20 book- and incredible, with 62 small house and cabin plans within. You'll ALSO get the mini-book on Adirondack Pallet Chair construction from Repurposedgoods.com! And more to come....WHEN: Sat, July 9th- Rain Or Shine....we'll mega-tent the whole thing if we have to.... 8 am to 10pm culminating in a cocktail/wind-up/bonfire on the premises (weather pending).8:00 AM- 9:00 AM Check In/Coffee/Donuts Meet N' Greet- and on display will be Deek's extensive collection of tiny housing design books- some rare (as long as it isn't raining). This will give our attendees a chance to peruse through many books first hand (there's nothing worse than buying a book online upon arrival finding out that its nothing like you thought it'd be). We'll perhaps set up a few of our home-built solar cookers at this point, and some from solarovens.net as well. 9:00 AM- Deek will give a tour of the micro-cabins on the premises (most featured in \"Tiny Yellow House\" TV, The NY Times, PBS) and point out many of their salvage-built incorporations, and the ideas behind them. Attendees will be welcome to paw through and go inside each of these structures, while we talk about how they were built, why, and how recycled materials were used.      On hand will most likely be- THE HICKSHAW, THE GYPSY JUNKER, THE BOXY LADY (as Seen at Maker Faire 2010 in NYC (A best in show prize winner/editor's choice)), and possibly THE WEDGIE (a micro-shelter base-model), and THE GOTTAGIDDAWAY (a micro-shelter/small prototype for a pre-fab homeless shelter) -unless any of these are stuck on display elsewhere.      Deek will also take all on a tour of his materials collection and explain as to how certain salvaged items can be put to use and will be incorporated into future projects. The tips/tricks of the trade in terms of salvaging (Deek's road kit) will be shown and talked about too....UPDATE- it looks like our LARGEST cabin/treehouse (in its prefabricated state) \"THE WOLFE'S DEN\" will also be on hand- before we drive it out to NY for re-assembling up in a tree.  10:00 AM- Environmental Engineer and Harvard Grad, Dustin \"Dr. Demolition\" Diedricksen will talk about his experiences in his own small house (featured on CBS news) and give a demonstration on pallet speed-deconstruction and general salvage-harvesting tips (some of the materials of which will be used in the project later in the day).  A pallet deck chair from our Make Magazine/TV episode will also be on display, and other uses for pallet wood (and methods to do so) will be talked about. Each attendee will also get a free booklet of pallet-wood adirondack plans from Shelton Davis over at REPURPOSEDGOODS.com - based out of Atlanta.    We'll also showcase/explain our composting toilet set-up- and show the unit that was featured on our RelaxshacksDOTcom youtube channel....and yeah, its what you'll be using- my house is too tiny to accommodate the in and out of 20 or more people all day. 11:00 Alex Pino of TinyHouseTalk.com (coming up here from FL- to speak, report on, and film some of this all day event) will give a presentation on the tiny housing scene and mobile living/codes, and the problems that small home builders/owners face- and ways in which we can overcome some of those hurdles/spacial tips, etc. He'll also talk about his future small house construction aspirations and plans...his career as a full time tiny house addict, and more....11:30 to12:00- Deek will give a short demonstration on Redneck Windows- building and incorporating salvaged-material, home built windows into your shed, houses, cabin, hunting camp. etc. This, alongside, many other speaking segments, might be filmed for \"Tiny Yellow House\" TV- which YOU will be part of!12:00/12:15- 1:00/1:15 (Lunch guest/speaker) MIMI ZEIGER- Author of \"Tiny Houses\" and \"Micro-Green\" will be coming out from NYC to talk to us about her work in the tiny housing field, her reporting for Readymade, Dwell, and many other architectural magazines- and her newest tiny house design book. Its a Qn'A session with a woman well versed in the scene.1:00 or so- to 5:30- After a quick intro on \"Tools We Can't Live Without\", we'll get crackin' on some hands-on building, and swing some hammers towards constructing our micro-shelter (A VERY affordable ultra-micro-shelter/camp design) and a mini-book of plans, materials lists, sketches, descriptions and more will be given to each attendee as well. \"QUICK CAMPS n' LEG CRAMPS\" is the name of this mini-book/brainstorm-idea pack, which I really haven't sold or released anywhere else yet (it was up for a very short time in '09)- for workshop attendees ONLY! So that's book #3 you'll be handed- all yours to keep.This group project will incorporate some outside-the-box design, in conjunction with the usage of many tool and concepts that you'll later be able to employ while building your own structure down the road- all on a micro-scale- so we can attempt to finish the entire project in such a short amount of time. Alternative roofing ideas/examples will be talked about and shown too.... Its a large group, so we'll all have to take turns with the hands-on aspect of things, especially coordination-wise, but even as onlookers, you'll learn a good deal. Space pending. we might have a secondary project/tour in the works, if we split the group up. If we have time, we'll also touch-upon tricks of the trade, in terms of effective time, money, and labor savors while building your own home, or shelter down the road...Times (as with all)- get pretty flexible from here on out.... 5:30 pm- we take a dinner break (food included)- while TRISTAN CHAMBERS and LIBBY REINISH, builders of THE WHITTLED DOWN CARAVAN (which they recently drove across the entire US!) talk about their project, design, origins, and travels.

I built a tree house out of this stuff, and an arbor for my back deck.* Plastic shrink wrap material ... a substitute for Tyvek? (Deek: Prob TOO airtight- but there would be tons of other uses for it).* Copper wire* left over, partially empty cans of paint (Deek: Marine paint is usually very high grade, and VERY expensive). * various boat fittings (hinges, latches, other nice chrome plated bronze thingies)* quality lumber, especially teak, oak and mahogany.  I just finished building a really nice sofa table out of thrown out oak lumber and the top is a couple of mahogany boards that were the back seat of an outboard boat. Little useless chunks of oak board make my Sunday barbeque smell like a fancy Italian restaurant. (Deek: GREAT firewood too- if not treated/stained). * electronics (marine radios, cd players, speakers etc.) Some broken, some not.* flare guns and flares .... July 4 fun?  Home defense??? (Deek: Er.....might want to leave these behind- lol- unless for use on your own boat). * First aid kits and supplies* fishing tackle and lead fishing weights (can be sold for the metal melt value)* rope, cord, fishing line* tons of recyclable bottles and cans = $$$A couple of hours on weekend mornings cruising the boatyard dumpsters along Quincy-Weymouth-Hingham (Massachusetts) coast usually yield about $30 in recyclable beverage units plus AT LEAST a couple of the other treasures listed above.(plus, its fun!

Long before I was able to drive, I had a fantasy of living  down-and-out in a VW camper, aimlessly meandering it along isolated  roads far from civilization and parking it along the beach or deep in  the woods in order to catch some sleep and gather supplies.My fantasy never came true and it never will.  Turns out I’m not a  down-and-out sort;  my idea of roughing it is downgrading to a  three-star hotel.  But luckily for me, there’s nothing rough about the  new Volkswagen Westfalia Verdier Solar Powered Mobile Micro Home.Micro Homes are the way of the future.  At least that’s what the  design team at Verdier Solar Power thinks, as well as the Jury at  Germany’s Caravan Salon Dusseldorf, who awarded the company a Special  Design Award for their inspired VW redesign.The coming together of the Westfalia, long a symbol of the hippy  culture, and the green energy technology of Verdier takes the camper  experience and turns it on its head, transforming the simple VW bus into  a modern, self-sufficient driving/living machine with a smooth design  and the coolest features this side of a high-end fifth wheel.  Verdier  set out to enhance the “light recreational vehicle” and make the  Westfalia traveling experience more luxurious and autonomous        www.gliving.com for more"},

{"title": "Salvaging Tips #3 (towards the construction of that tiny dream house/home of yours)", "date": "Tuesday, May 24, 2011", "text": "To build small, spend-small, and live small, sometimes you have to \"think small\"- and by that, I mean keeping an eye out for often-overlooked materials when you're gunnin' to incorporate some free and salvaged materials in your small house (or any) project.Today's example (from a repeat experience (literally fifteen minutes ago)) deals with curbside doors. You'll often see these laying around, fresh from a remodel, or demolition project, and often times, as you all well know, these doors are in less than savory shape. This methodology also applies to kitchen cabinets, hinged windows, and anything else of the \"swingin'\" variety. Enter: \"The think 'smaller'\" plan.Ever cruise through the aisles of Home Depot, or whatever giant-mega-hardware store and see how much full-size door hinges cost? Well, most people chucking their old doors, don't know, don't care, and don't bother with such trivial trinkets- but at $7.00 or more per set (for even the lousiest hinges), here's where YOU swoop in, with you recycled junk-fabric superhero cape and all- \"Captian Cheapo\" to the rescue!Now assuming you have your little road kit of salvage-material tools (See our older, recently reposted article), in just such a case of an \"emergency\", you break 'em out, back out the screws of each and every door you find, and next thing you know, in ten minutes time, you have $25 or so in hinges- perhaps more....and if the doors DO happen to be nice looking, grab 'em too! With my construction projects and experiments, hinges are the one thing I seem to go through like water, so I've had this little tip o' thrift save my butt, and wallet, many times over. There's nothing worse that having to stop in the midst of a project to drive out to a not-so-convenient store to buy the smallest of supplies, so next time you're out, keep a loose lookout for even the ugliest, most-beaten, and least-luxurious of doors. Remember: There's more beyond just the wooden door itself. And if you can find handles, locksets (with keys- it happens), and other hardware as well- it might be worth your while. As I'm now working on a large treehouse/micro-guest sleeper/cabin for a client, the timing of finding today's hinges couldn't have worked out better- and I thought I'd share.  -Derek \"Deek\" DiedricksenFINDING JUNK and FREE MATERIALS FOR YOUR TINY HOME PROJECT: This article originally appeared many moon/fortnights ago on the older version of relaxshacks.comKi, and some of her advice, will ALSO appear in the upcoming new (and hugely expended) edition of my book \"Humble Homes, Simple Shacks...\"Wanna kill a few hours time?

We'll have our tiny cabin for the homeless \"The GottaGiddaWay\" there- and MORE! 10am to 2pm- lots of cool eco/green exhibits- great for the kids, and you can't argue with the price!   As for the shacks: Living so close to the area, I  was surprised that I really hadn’t heard of the Cape Cod Dune Shacks  Community in Truro, MA/Massachusetts- the town right next to  Provincetown (although I was aware of “The Outermost House” and Henry  Beston- having read his work (same general area)). Beston is the Henry  David Thoreau of the seashore- kind of the male version of Rachel Carson  (minus the groundbreaking pesticide-warning fame). That said, first  off, if you’ve never checked either town out- they’re both beyond  gorgeous- especially in architecture.  Secondly, upon searching for photos on these dune shacks/tiny houses,  I couldn’t find any ONE single photo gallery source for these cabins,  so I took it upon myself to line up a few photos I came across, for your  viewing pleasure. Photo-credit-wise, I can’t find ‘em, but I’d be glad  to post each artist if anyone recognizes a shot. I DO believe a few of  these are from Suzanne Lewis- a VERY talented, Austin-TX-area  photographer- who also released the book “Dune Shack Summer“-  which I will now HAVE to check out! Support her- she’s ultra  independent, and seems (from her video on kickstarter) like a really  nice, down to earth, person… http://www.suzannelewis.com     A little back story from http://www.discoveramerica.com … (and the photos will continue)… THE DUNE SHACKS- AN OVERVIEW: Provincetown’s rich  artistic legacy continues to manifest itself in the dozens of galleries  along Commercial Street and through countless resident writers and  painters. But out along the seashore, along a 3 mile stretch of sand  extending from about Race Point to High Head (in Truro), you can see a  more unusual remnant of the town’s artistic past — the dune shacks. These small, austere structures were built by the Life Saving Service  in the 19th century to house seamen. Sometime around the 1920s, long  after the dune shacks ceased housing life-saving personnel, many of the  community’s creative or eccentric spirits began using them as retreats  and hideaways. Probably the most famous of these was playwright Eugene  O’Neill, who purchased one and spent many summers there with his wife,  Agnes Boulton. O’Neill penned Anna Christie (1920) and The Hairy Ape (1921) while living in his shack, and in doing so gave the whole collection of dune shacks something of an arty cachet.  Other Provincetown artists soon followed O’Neill, including the  self-proclaimed “poet of the dunes,” Harry Kemp, who wrote many a verse  about the seashore’s stark, desolate splendor. Author Hazel  Hawthorne-Werner wrote The Salt House, a memoir tracing her  time amid the dunes, in 1929. It’s said that this book helped get the  shacks, along with the entire dunes district, onto the National Register  of Historic Places, helping to preserve them for years to come. In  later years, Jack Kerouac, e. e. cummings, Norman Mailer, and Jackson  Pollack also lived in these primitive structures.  The dune shacks haven’t been modernized much — none has electricity,  running water, or toilets. You stay in them for a chance to be with  nature and perhaps commune with the spirits of artists who have gone  before you. The dune shacks are now all set along the part of the Cape  Cod National Seashore that is known as the Province Lands. The park owns  most of the Provincetown dune shacks, though a few are managed by  nonprofit groups aimed at preserving them and their legacy. Some of  these organizations, such as the Peaked Hills Bars Trust and the  Provincetown Community Compact, allow visitors to stay in the dune  shacks through a variety of arrangements. Both groups run an  artist-in-residence program — artists can apply for short stays in some  of the shacks during the summer season. Only a handful of applicants are  admitted each year. If you’re not an artist, you can enter a lottery for the opportunity  to lease one of the shacks for a week in spring or fall. If you’re  interested in applying to spend time in a dune shack or you’d like to  join one of the nonprofit organizations that sponsors them, contact Dune  Shacks.  If you’re simply interested in exploring the terrain and seeing the  shacks, you can either book a tour with Art’s Dune Tours, or park behind  the Cape Inn, on Snail Road just off U.S. 6, where a 3 mile trail winds  through the dunes and past many of the dune shacks.     Sp there ya’ go- 15 photos of the Cape Cod dune shacks…which I WILL  have to check out in person once the weather gets nicer (but before the  HUGE tourist-rush on the Cape).  -Derek “Deek” Diedricksen"},

Lloyd Kahn's books have plenty of these type structures (more so on a rustic note), and I really think this sub-genre of tiny houses deserves its own book- if one doesn't exist already. You can find more on LaPierre at http://www.freespiritart.com/ and work from many other artists...-Derek \"Deek\" DiedricksenAh, the age old debate, whether or not to build a custom, from scratch, treehouse/treefort by yourself, or whether to hire one out and./or grab a kit fort? Well, I'm sure most of you know which route I'd take....and the choice mainly does depend on your skill level, access to tools, and most importantly, available time. My one bit of advice (from what I've heard time and time again), whether it be homemade, or a kit- be sure to let your kid (unless you're building it for yourself) have a part in the construction process- in the endrun he/she will appreciate the fort itself, and the experience that much more. Also, I chose this particular treehouse to showcase, as aside from some scale difference, it could certainly become a design for a tiny vacation home or small guest house or adults. Why not....I'd put some better/safer railings on my own though....and its more of a \"stilt house\" than a treehouse, or so I feel...not that there's anything wrong with tree/stilt combos (the cabin I'm working on right now, because of its size, might have to take both avenues of support). Anyway, this particular house is a kit, and has a related article that pushes how obtaining a kit fort is less expensive and less time consuming than building one from scratch. Probably true, but you'll also have a structure that literally will look like 1000 others out there and have no independent charm, on the other hand. A cool little design though, no doubt....My suggestion- build your own, and use as many salvaged/found/donated materials as possible (so long as the material is sound/strong)- you'll save yourseld a ton of money, and will be spreading a good message to those who see your creation, and those who utilize it. -Derek \"Deek\" Diedricksen"},

Ultimately this new very slightly altered design will give the user/users more maneuvering room within. All in all it will use a mix of new and recycled materials and lumber. The four windows are curbside finds that I've been hanging onto in my collection for some time (they fit and work perfectly for what I wanted in this), it will most likely utilize a 15-lite french door I've been storing, and recycled flooring/decking (over another layer of plywood)- some beautiful stuff that my neighbor scored for me recently (LaCivita- the \"Disgruntled Neighbor\" from Tiny Yellow House TV episodes #1 and #2).

Shaded by Oak and Madrone trees and next to a Redwood grove, enjoy the great outdoors on the large deck or by taking a hike in the woods. (We have multiple acres next to land without fences.)(Please read all of this description before making a reservation.)The cozy and clean semi-rustic cabin has a loft under a geodesic dome (the \"mushroom cap\") with a double bed, which is a cotton futon with 2\" of latex foam and 2\" waffle foam on top. (It is now softer for you folks who like a soft cushiony bed.) We provide clean sheets and pillow cases: you can chose either smooth cotton sheets or cotton flannel. Plenty of blankets are also provided. In the loft, we have a 22\" LCD Screen with a DVD player (no TV) for movies. (We have some movies you can view as well.)On the main floor (a Pentagon) is a couch that doubles as a narrow futon (which could sleep a third person for an extra $10.), as well as a mini kitchenette. Here you will find a double hotplate, small refrigerator, toaster oven, blender, toaster, French Coffee press, - even a mixer- and all the dishes and equipment you would need to prepare a snack or a meal. We have 2 tables where you can enjoy meals, games, etc.: 1 inside and 1 outside on the large deck that faces the redwoods. We provide Organic Coffee, teas, Oatmeal, raisins, spices, oil and vinegar and various snacks and filtered well water.The cute bathroom has a Travertine shower, custom tiled sink and flushing toilet. We provide towels, soap, a hair blow-dryer, etc. (a word of caution: the bathroom has a low ceiling. If you are over 6' you may have to do a little ducking here and there.)As Saturdays are very much in demand, (and we like to be free on Saturdays), we require a minimum 2 day stay on the weekends. Keep in mind that Friday and Saturday nights, starting in June, are $100. each. Therefore, to stay here on the weekend will cost $200. plus the $30. cleaning fee plus 10% that airbnb will charge you ($23.). So the total will be $253. To stay for 2 days mid-week costs a grand total of $220. This will go up in June: each weekday night will be $90. instead of $85. Still a bargain! On 3 day holidays, we require a 3 day reservation.Although it feels very isolated here, we are less than 10 minutes to Aptos Village where you will find stores, restaurants, a theater, a health food store, Safeway, etc. We are centrally located on the Monterey Bay: 10 minutes from the beach (Rio Del Mar and Seacliff State Beach) as well as Nisene Marks State Park for miles of hiking or dirt biking in the Redwoods. We are 20 minutes to downtown Santa Cruz, 25 min. to the Beach Boardwalk, 45 minutes to Monterey and 1 1/2 hours to San Francisco.If you love hummingbirds, bring your camera. Our garden is the year-round home to many Anna Hummingbirds. (We have about 60 - 80 year-round.)Please, no smoking in the cabin or on the property.Some cell phones don't work here, but if you need to make local calls, you can use our home phone.

{"title": "A Bookmobile (tiny book store-slash-micro camper)- designed for Cedar Crest College", "date": "Wednesday, April 20, 2011", "text": "Recently an individual by the name of Chimae Cupschalk bought a copy of my book \"Humble Homes, Simple Shacks...\" and has since been in communication with me over a project, and a very unique and fun one, that a very good amount of time is being poured into in order to make this a reality. Chimae is planning (and VERY soon I understand) to embark on the construction of a mobile/portable \"bookmobile\" for Cedar Crest College in PA- which sounds like a really cool, and open-minded school.   Anyway, Chimae had asked me a ways back for some ideas, and here's one of them. I feel the sketch is somewhat shoddy, but the idea is there....or at least some ideas from which Chimae can hopefully pull some direction or inspiration. Naturally, as with most of my micro-structure/house designs, this little mobile kiosk also has the built-in possibilities of being a sleep-able vending cart (say, for the homeless, or street vendors/merchants, or even for music festivals (Burning Man, Coachella, etc).A bookmobile (sleepable-vending kiosk) designed by myself (Derek Diedricksen)- this particular sketch is NOT in my book, but it may appear in the next one, where I've already amassed 60 or so new tiny house, small cabin designs.  Chimae- we wish you the best of luck, and would love to see photos when you actually get to building whatever you decide upon.-Derek \"Deek\" DiedricksenThe less-revealed tips to building a simple treehouse.....which also greatly applies to tiny house dwellers, as in some areas, you can get away with building a micro structure in a tree (deeming it \"sculpture\" or a mere \"kid's fort\" when and if any ball-bustin' authorities come by) which can very well serve as guest quarters, or depending on your locale or county (ie. in a few places in the US where there are no building codes), as your actual micro-home. Anyway, I've read books upon books dealing with treehouse ideas and construction, and I feel a good deal of them tend to get overly technical, in some respects, in terms of treehouse building (many of these books are GREAT though, especially for inspiration). What I also mean by this is that the too often recommend custom or high-end materials or techniques that simply go too far beyond the budget of the the \"Average Joe\" (or Jane), when it comes to building a treehut/tree-home escape for either yourself, or the kids....So....as I've been doing a good deal of tree climbing lately in order to situate a platform thirty-five feet in the air (for adults only- as its a steep ladder and free climb combo to get up there), here are a few of the tips and methods that have resurfaced as I'm getting more-so back into this genre as of lately. I've designed a ton of treehouses on paper, but haven't slapped one in a tree in some time now (I'm building a small one, to get me back in practice/training (enter: Rocky training-montage theme music) for a much larger one I'll be building for a client this summer/fall.This later project will serve as a micro guesthouse. Aside from the all the logical and normal steps (ie. select a healthy. and stout/big tree) here are some less-harped about tips for when YOU decide to do some aerial building...1. Try to find a tree that is easy enough to free climb (without a ladder)- this just could save your butt if you accidentally knock the ladder down, or find yourself in any situation where you need to get down to earth by a means other than free-falling. Ouch. 2. I've never really considered pole-to-earth structures as true treehouses (they still rock...) so try and select a tree with as many large branches as you can (maples- in my regions of MA are usually perfect and plentiful). It makes the siting, climbing, wood and material hauling (in terms of free-climb stops on the way if need be) all the easier. The con- the more branches, the less maneuverability you have to set a ladder. 3. Don't build a treehouse too close to a neighbors house, or in a direction where a good deal (or any) of the windows are facing the neighbors property, or upstairs windows. It may sound comical, but seriously, if you're an adult building a treehouse, most others will find that odd enough- nevermind that this treehouse has a plethora of windows angled towards a yard that isn't yours.....of course, the best idea is to brief and consult your neighbors on the idea first....as to them, a treehouse shaped like a bust of Harry Potter eating a slice of pizza, could be strangely deemed an eyesore.4. Realize that no matter how much planning you do ahead of time, a tree and its configuration of branches, is not a symmetrical, nor easily-measureable, entity. DO design your plans to anticipate last minute tweaks, changes, and alterations. Don't beat yourself up trying to fit in plans and walls that just won't work- you'll be wasting your time, and well, beating oneself up sounds painful.5. On one of your initial pre-build climbs, knock or cut down any small, unsafe, rotten branches, that you might be tempted to grab or hang onto at some later-climb. I usually give even the healthy looking ones a test kick, to make sure they're not rotten on the interior. I heat my home with wood primarily, so I barrel all these sticks and squaw wood for kindling later on.6. If you have to free-climb, always make sure to hold onto two seperate branches (if you can) while ascending- if one gives, at least you're already hanging onto another. I've fallen out of a few trees back in the day, so take my word for it. One fall was thirty-two feet- into a lake, luckily! Safety ropes are always a GREAT idea too. 7. This one's often tough, but TRY to build your treehouse in a somewhat aerodynamic fashion in regards to the prevailing winds. If you geographically live in a region, like a valley, with frequent one-directional winds, for example, don't fight mother nature. If you live atop Mt. Washington, don't build a treehouse at all! 8. DO take frequent breaks and adhere to a very loose schedule. In other words never rush things for a timeline- you're IN A TREE, HIGH ABOVE THE GROUND- and any rushed work can easily result in accidents. So far, with the platform I'm building, I've only raised and bolted one supporting joist each day- I'm in no rush- especially when I look down at the rock-covered ground three-to-four stories below. 9. In addition to slotting the bolt holes in your supporting lumber (to compensate for tree swaying and movement) I think its a good idea to install additional safety cables, AND secondary joist supports below, should anything give way. If you're any good at lashings, you can also use HEAVY-DUTY (poly)rope to lash the joists to a tree after they're bolted in. My cousins in the past have made treehouses at great heights with lashings alone- and they held for a very long time- even when they used only thin bailing twine (which I wouldn't recommend!).          9B. Have at least 5-6 changes of underwear on hand from all the aerial construction you'll be doing.No, not really....4 pairs will do. 10. \"Bucket your tools\"- in other words, tie a long rope to a bucket (and a pulley if you care to set one) and haul this up when you need to bring tools top-side. Don't climb with and armload of tools, its dangerous, and I can't tell you how many times in the past I've done so, and dropped about half of them on the way up.You can also screw a small hook into the tree to serve as a tool stash for your work up above. 11. Always have someone on hand to spot, and help you. If you're a minor, always have a knowledgeable adult on hand. 12. And...Bring a cell phone along for the ride. If you fall and end up seriously hurt, you might be able to physically make it back to the house to call an ambulance from a land-line. Come to think of it, for immediate, neighborly help, aside from constantly shouting, a keychain airhorn, might be of help too...or a serious set of lungs for some hollerin'! And lastly (#13, I lied!), and this is going against my own plans in this case, but you don't have to necessarily make a treehouse forty feet in the air (I'm doing so for the view), its STILL a treehouse even if its only six feet up. Any other tips- feel free to add them- we'd love to hear from you....-Derek \"Deek\" Diedricksen(for fans of/about: Treehouses, treehut, treehome, treefort, tiny houses in trees, platform homes, small living)"},

Anyway, this one is VERY simple- and very cool looking....Here's the write-up from A PLACE IMAGINED          After seeing Jill's backyard play space (previous post), I have begun to think more about the degree of enclosure necessary to create a playhouse.  Children have such wonderful imaginations, something as simple as a change in ground material or an elevated platform could quickly become a castle and in the next minute transform into a rocket ship.  So with that in mind, how much of a visual barrier is really required to create a space?  I do see the value in having a private little nook tucked away from the rest of the world, but  in some cases, such as on a school playground, you may need to see the children at all times.  There are some great examples out there of creative ways to minimally define play spaces, and I'm on the look out, so if you know of one send it my way.  The design above is by  Truitt Foug Architects.  I love the modern shape and chunky structure!  I can imagine kids climbing the walls of this one!  If you look closely you can see a second floor or loft area.  It appears to be 6x6's (I'm guessing size) resting on the horizontals that make up the walls.  Sometimes the most basic straightforward designs are the best.  Also, notice that the entire play space was pulled off using only one material.  Ok, one material and fasteners, but still.  It still amazes me that there is such variety in playhouse design.  It's great to go from looking at a highly ornate playhouse of the past to minimalist modern structure like this one! ---------------------Derek \"Deek\" Diedricksen"},

Well, that is true, but its also true that with a little pre-planning -and searching, you CAN find a TON of free paint most anywhere as well- and if the colors aren't up to your liking- mix 'em until you get something more workable or palletable. As for the nails, especially with larger ones, I always have two small buckets on hand when I'm dismantling projects and salvaging (removing nails) from wood- one bucket is for nails that are still useable and good (or easily bent back into shape), the other's for nails that are totally hopeless. This later bucket eventually goes to the metal scrap yard for recycling. The point is, though, that after a little salvaging here and there, you'll be amazed at how much by the way of hardware (nails, hinges, hooks, bolts, lag screws) you'll accumulate- and aside from the expenditure of time, yes, even your nails will be free...In the case of the swingset I'm also assuming (if built properly) that its fairly loaded with galvanized carriage bolts- and sizeable ones too....and those things don't come all that cheap....not to mention the other specialized hardware a playground-set harbors- which you just may find a use for...As for the gas money to get to these free items- well, that's where selling some of this stuff on the side not only covers that and evens things out, but brings you out far ahead in the end of this often fun and rewarding game. Also, after doing this for awhile, you may end up with an excess of perfectly useable lumber. If that starts taking up too much room next to your front-yard collection of garden gnomes, then there's also the cash possibility of moving THAT as well.

And that’s how the 02 Sustainability Treehouse looks suspended 45 feet up a poplar tree in the front yard of the Pewaukee, Wisconsin, house in which it was built. At the base of the tree is a basket constructed of polypropylene panels connected to an electric winch, which is tied to the roof of the tree house. As though in an elevator, occupants ascend the tree and enter superhero-style through a triangular door on the floor. Here, the real fun begins. The entire structure is clad in translucent 16th-inch triangulated polypropylene panels, half of which open to allow breezes to waft in on warm summer nights. “In daytime, the light filters in and it has a really soft quality, like a pillow room,” explains Feider.The standard model 02 Sustainability Treehouse is 13 feet wide and costs $18,800, which includes three weeks’ installation labor. A do-it-yourself kit is about half that price. All materials are 100 percent recycled or recyclable, and interiors and sizes can be customized per client specifications.“I think sunset up there is my favorite time,” says Feider. “Then, you get all these amazing purple shadows. It’s so much better than watching TV.”Read more: http://www.dwell.com/articles/by-poplar-demand.html#ixzz1IUpcOe00----------------------- -Derek \"Deek\" Diedricksen (for fans of: treehouses, treehuts, treehomes, portable living, mobile dwellings, domes, lloyd kahn, shelter)"},

You can explore his structures in his YouTube series, \"Tiny Yellow House\" and also his book, \"Humble Homes Simple Shacks Cozy Cottages Ramshackle Retreats Funky Forts,\" which we will be reviewing soon, once we have sufficiently pored over it from cover to cover!  After contacting him, Deek very kindly agreed to do an exclusive interview for our blog, which I want to share with you all here.1. So, Deek, how did you first become interested in designing and constructing tiny dwellings?Well, that's actually a pretty lengthy, eye-glazing tale, but more or less, being fort-obsessed as a kid, an outdoors nut, a boy scout later on (Eagle Scout), and having a woodworking teacher as a father, the transition and implantation of my interest in small architecture was somewhat inevitable. I grew up in a small house, shared a small room with my brother Dustin until high school, vacationed in Maine and Vermont in tiny cabins, camped out all the time with the family, and just grew up loving the whole \"Cabin\" aesthethic and getaway-mentality. To me \"Small houses\" were synonymous with fun, freedom, and coziness.    My father, Glenn, also gave me the book \"Tiny Houses\" by Lester Walker for my 10th birthday, which was another one of the catalysts that showed me that it was OK to keep an interest in this alive into adulthood. That, along with him and my mother, Sigrid, being very supportive and tolerant of the childhood construction projects of me and my brother, laid the groundwork for my future and current \"obsession\" with all this. My father was also a high school woodworking teacher in Guilford, CT- which didn't hurt either in terms of knowledge and the array of available tools at home., 2. Tell me about the first structure you built. How old were you? What was it called? (I'm assuming you lovingly name all your creations). What was its purpose, if any?I built a TON, and I mean a ton of ramshackle kid forts when I was very young, in fact I often had more than one being worked on at any given time, but the FIRST cabin I built, that I consider an initial step into a more \"serious\" approach, surprisingly didn't have a name. It was a 6' by 8' one-pitch roofed shed in my back yard in Madison, CT that my brother, Dustin, and my good friend, Dane Sjoblom, cobbled together. It had heat, insulation, a hammock, platform bed, a \"real\" window, electricity, and vintage typewriter on a desk that I used to peck away stories on. This cabin/shed sat right next to a little turtle pond that my brother and I hand dug too.    Why did we go to such lengths to construct something like this? Well, my parents weren't too fond, understandably, of my brother and I incessantly playing video games when the first Nintendo system came out, and since we only had one TV and they didn't want us monopolizing it, we built our own little getaway house out back, where we could blast away digital aliens on a tiny, discarded, black and white television to our hearts content. We had quite a few fun sleepovers in that cabin. My father, Glenn, did help us build the door, and a few other things, but for the most part, at age 11 (my brother was 8), we almost built the entire things ourselves, design and all. Sadly, from years of not being used, and sitting there unmaintained for so long, we had to finally dismantle is several years ago. 3. Your design-cum-comic book “Humble Homes Simple Shacks Cozy Cottages Ramshackle Retreats Funky Forts and Whatever the Heck Else We Could Squeeze in Here” contains tons of wacky ideas for living space, no doubt a vestige of your comic strip writing days. How do you decide what to build, and what to leave to the imagination? I think a lot of that depends on the materials I have on hand, my mood, and what chunk of time I might, or might not have in the forseeable future. With kids, another book in the works, a side job doing other forms of carpentry, being involved with two bands, and running my blog, among other things, its sometimes real tough to squeeze in these micro-shelter projects- but I often do. Many times it just comes down to what's striking my fancy, or what is freshest in my mind- which is always changing, design-wise. For example, I'd like to begin work on a shanty-boat I've been plotting in my head (and somewhere on a napkin at best), but that's on the back burner because we're still stuck in frigid temperatures out here in New England.    Some of these designs in my book, will probably only be left to the imagination on my end, as I have neither the yard space, nor the funds- or the need- to tackle some of them. This more so applies to many of the unreleased sketches I have, which I self-describe, or categorize, as \"Future Funk\"- alot of them being free-form, sculpted, ferro cement micro homes. Most of these will end up in Book three of the \"Weird-guy-on-a-couch-with-a-pen-who-drinks-too-much-Folgers\" tiny house design series.4. One of your designs is for a $100 Homeless Hut. Obviously, there is potential for great philanthropy there. Also, using recycled materials is a large feature of your designs. Do you have any specific goals as a \"larkitect\" e.g. promoting sustainable design, or better care for the homeless?I guess my goals as a \"larkitect\" are mainly to think outside the box - a luxury I have, in terms of backyard experimentation with prototypes and designs- and to additionally attempt to develop ultra-affordable options for housing, homeless quarters, relief shelters, and vacation camps. The uniform theme, in a nutshell, is wasting less, spending less, and hoping to convey to others that you actually NEED less than most of us have been conditioned to believe. The emphasis on recycled and discarded materials, is pretty constant throughout all my cabins as well. 5. Finally, the question we all want to hear. Any chance you might take on an apprentice?Funny you mention it, even if in jest, as I'd LOVE, and need, to have one, but my schedule is so erratic, I really don't ever know how I'd work things out. Its also tough to find someone you completely click with in terms of carpentry and construction. Two is often a crowd and the \"helper\" ends up getting in the way unfortunately. My brother Dustin is the only person I can really and truly read the mind of in terms of projects, and the same goes the other way around- he's the one person I don't even have to speak to, and he understands what needs to be done. He and I can build for hours without even communicating in some cases- its almost bizarre. Unfortunately he's a full time environmental engineer, and a brand new dad, so time-wise he's out. BUT he will be helping out with our July 9th workshop in Massachusetts. But yeah, down the road, heck, I just might need a carpentry crew if things continue at this pace.Thank you, Deek!Mr. Diedricksen's Book, \"Humble Homes Simple Shacks Cozy Cottages Ramshackle Retreats Funky Forts and Whatever the Heck Else We Could Squeeze in Here\" is available on his website Relaxshax.--------------------------------Derek \"Deek\" Diedricksen"},

{"title": "Micro rolling hotels/cabins on train tracks? A different take on tiny housing on wheels", "date": "Thursday, March 24, 2011", "text": "From http://news.architecture.sk/2011/01/rolling-hotel.php   Norwegian architectural studio Jagnefält Milton Architecture came up with a unique idea how to liven up the small town of Åndalsnes. The town serves as a gateway to the region’s magnificent fjords and is surrounded by splendid nature. The architects designed a hotel that rolls on the train tracks that connect the town to the outside. The hotel does not resemble a traditional train at all but looks more like a number of large boxes loaded with oversized freight. Fortunately the impression is not correct and inside of the boxes of various heights and widths are fully furnished minimalist rooms big enough to sleep in. This way the tourists can get to see the country and not lose a minute searching for accommodation. The proposal goes further into details to include a rolling public bath and concert hall that could travel along the rails. When winter sets in, the units collect near the town center and in summer they travel along the various existing train tracks. The design has an interesting retro feeling and reminds us of the times hundred years ago in USA when private cars traveled on the rails. Nevertheless this idea is practical in all ways and this hotel does not negatively affect the nature and is environment friendly.

{"title": "A \"fancy\" tiny pallet/junk house (talk about an oxymoron!) from I Beam Design....", "date": "Tuesday, March 22, 2011", "text": "From the architects that blew me off- twice...True- as I've emailed these people to conduct an interview in the past, and another time to gain permission to put their pallet-house photo in my upcoming book via The Lyons Press- but its still a very cool refugee/emergency/low-budget tiny house concept....so while its builders/creators are just too damn busy for lowly scum like me (lol)- here's a video of the photo I've posted in the past, as I do like the design and some of the ideas. This thing WOULD be drafty as heck though- and that's coming from a guy who has plenty of knot-holes in his own cabins....in their defense.So here it is, a great little pallet house from I Beam Design (NYC I believe). Enjoy (minus the \"pac-man arcade short-circuiting soundtrack\"). I think you'll dig the MOVING tour of this one (as again, the static photo has been floating around for quite some time). I was thrilled/flattered to have been chosen a ways back (My VT Cabin- built by myself and my younger brother Dustin) for Mimi Zeiger's brand new book \"Micro-Green\"- which in all honestly, is one of the cooler, more-bizarre, photographic, micro-house/tiny housing tomes that I've seen in awhile. Beyond that, Mimi just informed me that Archidose.org (a great architectural blog) singled out both myself and Michael Janzen (of tinyhousedesign.com) as two of the more noteworthy D.I.Y. structures in this vast collection. This is definitely a surprise to me, and rather unexpected, as some of the mini houses in this book are pretty damn fantastic n' just outright wild. Here's the review here.... (and you can click further below to check out Mimi's book- which JUST hit stores). Micro Green is Brooklyn-based freelancer Mimi Zeiger's follow-up to Tiny Houses from 2009. In the earlier book the houses range in area from two digits to four, and roughly the same applies in the new title, which starts with a 43-sf (4 sm) \"Mobile Eco Second Home\" and ends with a 1,722-sf (160 sm) villa in Vals, Switzerland. In between the 34 other projects are arranged accordingly, from micro to tiny to small to not-so-big. Yet as the full title of Zeiger's latest makes clear, the focus of the collection is not just size but eco-conscious living and a Thoreau-esque retreat into nature. (One must turn to Tiny Houses for city living.)The collection is quite diverse in terms of design and geography, but most are quite photogenic, the hand of talented architects. A couple houses have been featured on my web pages previously (Rolling Huts, Chen House), and Zeiger's book influenced me with three projects creatively incorporating logs. Yet two projects, Michael Janzen's Tiny Free House and Derek and Dustin Diedrickson's Backwoods Skyscraper, stand out from the rest because they are not self consciously architecture with a capital A. They are respectively built from shipping palettes and salvaged doors, windows, and plywood, and they exhibit more than just a DIY aesthetic; they are DIY living, off the grid, for oneself and one's family. While they look like they might not support day-to-day living, they do just that. Ironically many of the other projects are not houses per se; they are cabins or other shelters for short-term living, not contemporary examples of Thoreau's move to the woods.(from archidose.org)    ARCHIDOSE's \"NARROW HOUSES\" review...Narrow Houses by McGill University Professor Avi Friedman also looks at small houses (not nearly as small as Micro Green), \"ecologically sensitive homes ... no more than 25 feet (7.6 meters) in width.\" Infill lots in cities come to mind, but townhouses comprise only nine of the 28 projects collected here. The rest are detached dwellings, some in urban conditions but most removed from the confines that reduce the benefits of building a narrow house, mainly the cross-ventilation on the long sides that is almost impossible to achieve with infill houses. That the majority of the projects are small houses (most are under 1,500 sf / 140 sm) on large plots of land points to a responsibility on the part of clients and architects towards reducing house sizes and increasing performance in terms of sun and wind. This also points to a reconsideration of the suburban ideal, the large energy-hungry home surrounded by lawn. Lessons towards this shift can be gleaned from these project, just as lessons towards dealing with tight urban lots (especially in terms of natural light) can be found in the townhouse chapter.Following the presentation of the 28 projects are four thorough essays by Friedman: design principles, site and plan considerations, interiors, and a historical chronology of narrow-front homes. While this last section is geared at a lay audience more than architects, the latter benefit from their inclusion in the book, as various considerations towards dealing with narrow lots and designing narrow houses are collected in one place. These essays can be seen as an outcome of the efforts of McGill's Affordable Homes program, which Friedman heads; all then informs the selection of the preceding projects. Together the writing and case studies offer valuable information and precedents for architects and clients aiming to build a narrow house either out of circumstance or responsibility.-Derek \"Deek\" Diedricksen"},

I'm posting this too, as we recently had a discussion on the very same idea here on Relaxshacks.com- living in dry-docked boat cabins (where, again, in some cases you can even get these boat shells for FREE on craigslist). Yes, these spaces are going to be far too tiny for most, but hey, if you're single, or an adventurous duo, by living in one of these even for a brief period of time, you'd no doubt save a TON of money. Anyway, the video starts out a little \"earthquake shaky\", but hang in there, as Kevin gives us a nice tour throughout this little sailboat. Another part of the beauty of tiny sailboat living, is that if you're NOT handy at all, these come fully equipped and ready for use -as opposed to building your own tiny home- especially if time is something you don't have much of.

(a la Van and RV Dwelling)", "date": "Monday, March 7, 2011", "text": "I was having a coffee-laden internal conversation with myself the other day, and a long-running idea kept coming back to me....As most micro dwellers are living on the DL anyway (in the permissive backyards of others, etc), why not simply park a good-sized, dry-docked sailboat with a cabin somewhere, and live in THAT? Most sailboats in the 23' and beyond range are outfitted with small cabins, sleeping berths, and micro-toilers, so why not? Better yet, I can't tell you how many FREE sailboats- some HUGE ones too- I've seen on craigslist.org. Fix these suckers up a little, customize them, enclose some of the deck area, and you might have yourself a nice little, unique, place to call home, even if just for awhile. Beyond that, as long as you're not in a hugely congested area, most people might not know, or care, AND boat owners park their winterized, or ununsed boats in their own yards anyway, so you're not going to stick out like a sore thumb anywhere. If I were straight out of college, single, and had this idea, this might be the route I'd take- especially in today's economy, where living cheaply might be one of the few means of survival.      More or less, boats ARE tiny homes/houses, and while a '23 foot cabin might be a little cramped, keep in mind boats do come in all shapes and sizes. Also, as more and more people seem to be cutting back or, sadly, losing their jobs these days, you're seeing more and more very affordably-priced used boats on the market. 'Just though, whether a good or bad idea, that this might be an interesting enough topic or subject for discussion or comments....This boat here doesn't so much apply to the example/discussion, but it could easily be converted into a houseboat, tiny home, or shantyboat with minimal work.

{"title": "The New York Times- and A WHOLE LOTTA \"SCHTUFF\" GOING ON with our show/future mini-cabin.house projects", "date": "Wednesday, February 23, 2011", "text": "Note: This is DAY ONE of our new site locale- if any probs- you can still check out all the old posts, and order the book at the OLD SITE/BLOG... we'll slowly be moving hundreds of our posts to this new blog spot.Our mini-cabins are now for sale (The Hickshaw, The Boxy Lady, and The Gypsy Junker)- scroll wayyyy down for info...and the \"why\"....(mainly we wanna build more NEW things to film, blow up, push off cliffs, and we're running out of space to store these lil' classics). Don't worry, if they sell, we will have more/other stuff to showcase to attendees at our 2011 Hands-On Tiny Shelter/House Workshop in MA....TINY YELLOW HOUSE- OUR VERMONT CABIN EPISODE...To any new readers, esp. those coming from The New York Times feature, out today (Thurs)- WELCOME. And for ALL, here are MANY informational updates on our tiny house videos, micro-shelters, cabins, and my book (which you can order from the side column). Please do- and please be patient if you order one- they're ALL hand assembled- and I am but one guy, (in his pajamas, with a six-pack of PBR, making lots of post office trips when I can (not in my pajamas)). Aside from that there are TONS of things going on....and I posted some of our archived videos in the midst of all this for some of you to check out. Two of what I feel are the better/more fun, ones from our past work/collection. TINY YELLOW HOUSE #1- \"THE HICKSHAW\" CABIN- the original \"goof\" episode that spawned the rest of what we've done... You can watch ALL our other videos HEREFirst off, we're hoping to perhaps take the \"Tiny Yellow House\" TV show on the road at some point and film some more substantial cabins, homes, and treehouses- basically, showcasing the work of others alongside our own. Seattle would be a place we'd love to hit, but funding would be needed if we're to get the crew traveling for a multi-episode project. Several New England locales are also in the planning stages/an option- some CRAZY places/houses all in all! As always, if you'd like to reach a TON of people, we're looking for sponsors/backers (ad placement), AND if you'd simply like to make a donation and get your name in a future-episode (thanks you's)- senorsell@hotmail.com is our donation account. Heck, any huge donations and we might put YOU in the episode...seriously- you'd have to cover travel to meet us though....But enough blather....well, no, here's some more..... We're still hard at work on some micro-treehome/homeless shelter prototypes (photo above- and check the link for more)....Much more is to come on our $100 multi-faceted \"GottaGiddaWay\" shelter- which will be built to a larger scale down the road.....this will be shot for an episode for us, or Make Magazine eventually too.... HERE are some more photos of this TINY shelter.AND....myself and Bill Bracken, and the band I'm in-Age Against The Machine-are going back into the studio soon (yes, the show's music is US too) to work on some more material for TYH. Recently-ish, Bill and I wrote a song that Gary Cherone- Frontman for Extreme/Van Halen/Tribe Of Judah sang on.... you can check it out HERE/download it for $0.99. If we get enough downloads, we can then afford half a Clark Bar! A certain professional sports team might be using this song SOON too...we'll see....Otherwise, thanks for stoppin' in....more to come, each and every day....Oh yeah, the three micro-cabins in my yard are for sale- all proceeds will go towards shooting and building mini-frankensteinic shacks for our shows.....I've tweaked a few things on them more recently/put some new work into them too...The Hickshaw- $1500The Boxy Lady- $2000The Gypsy Junker- $3000The Fold Down Fort- From Make Magazine/TYH Episode- $600.00      Kid Cedar At Gmail Dot Com for inquiries....-Derek \"Deek\" DiedricksenOk one more, I lied.... The $200 microhouse/microhome in the New York Times newspaper by joyce wadler- tiny houses, shacks, cabins, forts, homes, cottages......     A HOUSE tour is the highlight of a visit with a proud homeowner, but when one drops in to see Derek Diedricksen, who makes playful micro-shelters out of junk, it is less so. Possibly because the temperature up here on a cold winter day is less so, possibly because his square footage is less so.  At about 24 square feet, the Gypsy Junker, made primarily out of shipping pallets, castoff storm windows and a neighbor’s discarded kitchen cabinets, is the largest of Mr. Diedricksen’s backyard structures. The Hickshaw, a sleeper built on a rolling cedar lounge chair (or as Mr. Diedricksen calls it, “a rickshaw for hicks”), is considerably smaller, at 2 1/2 feet wide by 6 1/2 feet deep. The Boxy Lady, two cubes on a long pallet, is the smallest: 4 feet tall at its highest point.  For ingenuity, thrift and charm, Mr. Diedricksen’s tiny structures are hard to beat. Made of scavenged materials, they cost on average less than $200 to build. They often have transparent roofing, which allows a fine view of the treetops, particularly in the smallest ones, where the most comfortable position is supine. They have loads of imaginative and decorative details: a porthole-like window salvaged from a front-loading washing machine, a flip-down metal counter taken from the same deceased washer. Mr. Diedricksen hates to throw anything away.  Still, the structures are neither warm nor commodious, and the reporter’s note-taking is hampered by blowing on her hands. It is so cold, in fact, that in deference to the reader, whose nose is no doubt starting to run, we shall go indoors for a spell, that one might consider Mr. Diedricksen’s accomplishments in comfort.  They are many. There is his self-published graphic instruction book, “Humble Homes Simple Shacks Cozy Cottages Ramshackle Retreats Funky Forts,” the first edition of which was “hand-assembled” and “locally printed” (in his living room); having sold 1,500 copies, it will be reissued by the Lyons Press next year. There is his YouTube series, “Tiny Yellow House,” which is shot whenever his brother-in-law, a videographer, has some free time, most recently in the auto-body shop of a fan because, as Mr. Diedricksen notes, when it is 10 degrees you don’t want to film outside.  Mr. Diedricksen makes a living doing carpentry and spends a lot of time as Mr. Mom to his two young children, but he has also been a comic book writer, a D.J. and a home inspector, and is a drummer in a Rage Against the Machine tribute band called Age Against the Machine. (The World Wrestling Entertainment theme song for the wrestler Jack Swagger, “Get on Your Knees”? His band wrote that.) Even the little structures he makes, with their multiple uses — fort-guest bedroom-festival sleeper-homeless shelter — are tough to categorize.  It’s hard to figure out how to describe him, Mr. Diedricksen is told.         “One reviewer called me ‘a mad scientist with too much lumber on his hands,’ ” Mr. Diedricksen says. “Another one called it, ‘This Old House Meets Wayne’s World.’ ”  That may be because of the “Harold and Kumar”-esque, moldy sleeping-bag vibe of the “Tiny Yellow House” series, one episode of which includes Mr. Diedricksen’s real-life neighbor yelling, “Diedricksen, when you gonna clean this mess up?”  Or because of Mr. Diedricksen’s ponytail, which he has since cut. Or because of the episode that ends with him picking his teeth for the camera. “Pizza mouth?” he asks.  One should also know that Mr. Diedricksen, 33, graduated from Northeastern University summa cum laude.         Is Mr. Diedricksen committed to building only tiny structures?         “I have only so much yard space and my wife is only so tolerant,” he says.         Mr. Diedricksen’s wife, Elizabeth, is a physical therapist. They live with their children and a large dog in a 950-square-foot house about 10 miles south of Boston, which they bought in 2002 for $190,000 — a fixer-upper, of course.  Stop by to visit with Mr. Diedricksen, and you’ll have to wait till the kids take their naps to talk. Having a tiny-house enthusiast for a dad would seem to be a great thing: Mr. Diedricksen made what looks like a large painting in the living room, but which can be pulled down to sprout orange flaps: an instant kid-size tent."},
{"title": "“The Goddagidda-way” micro-shelter (aka “The Homeless Hut”)", "date": "Tuesday, February 22, 2011", "text": "\"The Goddagidda Way\" designed and built by Derek \"Deek\" Diedricksen (a micro homeless shelter, pre-fab treehouse/treefort, and/or indoor escape cube all-in-one)Here are a few updated pictures of what I’ve now named “The Goddagidda-Way“- a mini/micro shelter designed as a tiny, EASY-to build escape cube (indoors or out), and/or a super-affordable short-term shelter for the homeless or for hikers/travelers, etc. Total cost: Approx. $100/$110.00. Its a mere 16 square feet inside, but “roomier” than you might think, for something mainly built our of two sheets of plywood. This also could be used for many other things (my intent)- for example, toss this lightweight structure into a platform in a tree- and voila, you have one of the simpler, cheaper, treeforts/treehouses you’ll ever come by (ie- down the road we’ll do so, and this will become the “head” of “The Tree-Rex Treehouse”). The beauty of this little shelter is that it can be built in well under a day, by someone with very little building experience.Build it indoors, for those privacy-challenged, tiny house dwellers out there, and you have a little cozy nook in which to read a book, or work from your laptop.Much more to come- and we’re eventually going to shoot this little structure, so as to show you how to build it yourself. (Note: The stainedglass artwork was donated by Satialee (her ebay shop name)- Real name: Stephanie Atlee. You can check out her work HERE. -Derek “Deek” Diedricksen This ISN’T an episode of “Tiny Yellow House” but I thought it fitting enough to put up on my youtube channel. I shot this last summer (I have literally 2o or more unedited mini-episodes on micro-houses, building, and more, that are sitting around) and wanted to get this up for this summer’s rental season. As I explain in the video, this little Cape Cod Style house of ours- just under 1000 square feet, with three bedrooms- has been in our family for three generations. We’re now forced to rent it out quite a bit these days just to make the tax payments in this GORGEOUS, and historical, but very pricey, Connecticut seaside town. If anyone is ever interested in renting, etc- you can contact me at kid cedar at gmail dot com, and I’ll put you in touch with my father. The place is walking distance to two restaurants and bars, and to downtown as well. The beach is literally 400 feet away too- you can blue crab right off the property, if you’re so daring as to trek through the marsh, and the golf course is 150 feet away- so you can sit back and heckle lousy golfers all day til your heart’s content! (no, please don’t).UPDATE- here’s a link for more photos, info, rates, a shot of the beach, etc… CLICK HERE-Derek “Deek” Diedricksen     First- we have our Jay Shafer/Tiny Tumbleweed House vid out n’ running NOW- I’ll post it pretty soon (and check Tinyhouseblog.com for it- possibly tomorrow)….ALSO…. July 11th OUR Relaxshacks.com 2011 Hands-On, Tiny Shelter/Tiny House Workshop is gonna be kick-butt- and selling out fast!

AND Since MANY have emailed and asked about my book (shown in the WBZ/CBS TV Broadcast, you can order it (while I still have copies) by clicking on the lefthand book icon). Thanks!  RE: Relaxshacks.com and Tiny MA Homes on CBS NEWS- AND our Tiny House/Shelter Building workshop for 2011….     Tonight (or last night, depending on when you read this) WBZ, the CBS affiliate out of Boston, MA ran a story on tiny/small houses, as a means and lifestyle towards living on less in tough economic times. It was based on a shoot, and interviews, at both my house (they call it “tiny”- but its not- more so “small/modest”) and at Dustin and Dawn Diedricksen’s (yes, my brother- same state).Dustin’s house  is where we’ll be hosting (outdoors AND in) our Relaxshacks.com Tiny House/Shelter Building Workshop 2011 here in Massachusetts (Scituate)- date tba. It’ll be a small group overall (15 or so people tops), and VERY eclectic with TONS involved/planned….email me at kidcedar@gmail.com if interested….and we’ll keep you updated.AS for WBZ News (and thank you to Ken Tucci and crew!)

BE SAFE!  \"The Beak (2)\" Treehouse by Derek \"Deek\" Diedricksen- (it'll perhaps be in my 2nd upcoming tiny house/structure book- or 3rd- who knows...)And…Here’s another sketch I did the other night of a VERY SIMPLE treehouse/tree-cabin idea- only 4′ by 8′- that could sleep one or two people for vacation-weekends/hunting/writing/snoozing/meditating/sketching (MY intent- a micro-office in a tree (again, a “Troffice”). The sketch shown gives the base-smallest size at which it could be affordably and quickly built- utilizing only 3-4 sheets of stock-size 3/4″ plywood. Naturally other wood is involved, but most of which is small sized lumber that could easily be found/salvaged over time, or bought inexpensively. Its a simple enough project in that it could be built, and then hoisted into a tree in a single day, and could serve as a means to help those not-so-carpentry oriented, to try their hand at several skills, approaches, and the usage of many tools. Its kinda funky/weird too- as opposed to building a boxier shed-like house- not that I have any prob with those (I have built many…).BUT THIS IS RIDICULOUS- ITS TOO DAMN SMALL (you might be thinking)! Well, width and height-wise, a structure like this could certainly be mathematically expanded upon to serve one’s needs. Other changes, such as a support post, to carry the weight of a larger version of this, could very simply be incorporated too.This is another one of the quick-to-build ideas we could try at our 2011 Relaxshacks.com Tiny Shelter Building Workshop this summer (ONE of the projects/topics of MANY, that we’d be covering and demonstrating). We’ll have many more proposed group project ideas forthcoming too- and even a CONTEST on simple structures soon as well- with some guest/judges. To those interested in perhaps attending- please leave a comment and I’ll get you more info…-Derek “Deek” DiedricksenFor those treehouse/treehome nuts out there, or those just stumbling on this blog- be sure to check out my book (left hand column to order), or any of the works from David and Jeanie Stiles, and Pete/Peter Nelson of The Treehouse Workshop Inc.

I love the simple design, and amenities (toilet/water, etc) could certainly be added to this little getaway- although you might not opt for the see-through walls in this case…AGAIN- more to come…off to shoot some more videos today too…One on our 2011 Relaxshacks.com Hands-On, Tiny Shelter/House Building Workshop- being held in MA- July 9th- kidcedar at gmail dot com for more info or to reserve a spot"},

One so strong that we lowered a Mercedes on it and it wouldn’t break (until take #2- which is the one you see in the video). The chair actually held up the entire car and started knocking it off its hydraulic lift- which we’ll eventually show too when we later air a longer, uncut run of the episode.In the meantime (this is post #2 of the day- so sorry this is less tiny house/architecture oriented- see the other post below) as we’re planning on some HUGE things for “Tiny Yellow House” TV- some of which might require airline travel, a better budget, crew, and more. Anyway, before we eventually try our hand at kickstarter.com to gather some funds for a series of 4 or so new episodes, I’m also going to start offering some “fund raising” art up for sale. The proceeds from any of these sales will be funneling into simply shooting more episodes of the show….YOU’LL ALSO BE THANKED BY NAME/BIZ IN AN UPCOMING EPISODE AS WELL for helpin’ us out! As for the art….(some far-out stuff, not for all, but it MIGHT be right up YOUR alley…)“Cyclopian Squibble” (shown way above)- $300 (buyer pays shipping)  Salvaged/recycled art- approx. 18″ by 3′ in size- on 3/4 plywood, with Brazilian hardwood (flooring leftovers) as trim, and milk caps/screws/plastic incorporated. Done in thick ink…. it took MANY coats of paint to get that bright orange, and a very decent amount of time to take for something rather simple.THE FOLD DOWN FORT- is also for sale- mixed-recycled media. $600 (buyer pays shipping). Its pretty huge- 2.5′ wide, by 4′ high. Check the pictures AND the video below (its now seen OVER 50,000 views). We built this for Make Magazine and their online TV show. The funds from this would very much so help the funding of another project, materials, and episode….which we certainly could use to keep this whole thing going more frequently.kid cedar at gmail dot com if you’re interested… More to come…-Derek “Deek” Diedricksen    A Modern, Cube-like Mini/Tiny House/Cabin in The Catskills (NY)…..I gave you the funky-art post (below) about 12 or so hours back, which was not-so house-related, so here’s a quick rebound-update… via Freshome-Derek “Deek” Diedricksen Here’s a shed structure courtesy of a company called “TUFFSHED” who seems to make some quality items.

The window you see near the floor, actually opens outward and will later serve as the entrance to a “secret room” of sorts (storage, or a tiny library/reading room).Ultimately, the exterior of this little room will be masked as a large doghouse/shed.

Truth be told, “dumpster diving” for things other than construction materials isn’t such a far cry from the minset behind “salvage construction” as you’ll see in the attached video. Its truly unbelievable how much gets wasted here in the states. In the tiny housing/small living world, since a good deal of the aim and impetus is to build affordably and “beat the system” to a degree, why not try this? If you’re worried about appearances, do it a night, and if confronted by”authorities”- go to the age old excuse “I’m moving, and was just looking for boxes”.

Only 12 or so people will be allowed to enroll, so act fast if you’re interested. AND…Reader Scott House turned me on to the site/company IDAHO SHEEP CAMP, which builds mobile camps/caravans which are beautifully outfitted.

Those who appreciate modern architecture with an unconventional twist will want to plan their next trip to North-West Germany, where you’ll find this contemporary treehouse perched between an alder and an oak in Osnabruck. Designed by architectural firm Baumraum, a company specializing in tree-top dwellings, the treehouse stands out with its curved roof and many windows. Although this modern home carries a totally sophisticated design, it still boasts those traditionally playful elements that make it a true treehouse – a rope ladder, plenty of outdoor deck space, and of course, nature-inspired interiors. Baumraumvia InhabitatI’ve really been on a treehouse kick lately, esp. as we might be building one collectively (attendees interest/vote pending) at our 2011 Relaxshacks.com Hands-On, Tiny Shetler/House Building Workshop- kidcedar@gmail,com for more info and to reserve one of the very few spots we have left.

Its off to shovel my roof some more, so its a short post today (there have now been 92 roof collapses in the state of MA from snow as of last night!). Anyway, as I’m a fan of bright n’ bold trim colors (and just vibrant colors in general (see my “Tree-Rex Treehouse post recently)), this green/garden-roofed chicken coop design caught my attention.The “kippen” chicken coopNow hear me out…Visualize this little structure (mostly the above front-view photo), but in larger form, and with a set of french doors added in the entrance space, and perhaps a window or two cut-in for some natural light, and blamo!- you’d have what would amount to a very simple, yet pleasing-looking, and affordable mini vacation home or cabin/cottage. Add a tiny little wooden-slab deck out in the front (on hinges so that it folds UP against the house and locks while you’re away) and it’d be even more catering to your outdoor/indoor relaxation.I know it seems bizarre, but some of my own inspirations for designs and sketches for tiny houses and homes come from offshoot photos and concepts like this one.-Derek “Deek” Diedricksen"},

I’ve also been tearing through books and will have ANOTHER “Tiny Yellow House/Relaxshacks.com” book review video-episode on the way shortly.In the past, I launched a side episode/show called “Man With The Ugly Hat” solely composed of tiny house, small living, back-to-the-land, book reviews, (I’ll post it wayyy below if you missed it), and speaking of caffeine, most found it far too over the top. Well, IT WAS, and I DID have a blast shooting this little one-take video, but next time, so as to reach (and not scare) a greater deal of people, we just might tone it down a little…..or will we????That said, among over a dozen new reviews to come, one of my favorites was “Compact Cabins” by Gerald Rowan.“Rowan’s ’Compact Cabins’ hooked me immediately- I mean I can’t stop pawin’ through this thing! Its LOADED with (sixty-two!) plans and concepts for cabins, tiny homes, and vacation cottages, some sound “tricks of the trade” advice from an author who clearly knows the trade (and seems passionate about it too), and a non-stop provision of some great watercolored visuals and illustrations- a combination of which has earned this one a place in my all-time “Tiny- House-Book Favorites”. Rank it up there with the work of Lloyd Kahn, David and Jeanie Stiles, and Dan Mulfinger, its just a great all around book for your cabin aspirations. Pick it up and commence drooling, plotting, and daydreaming.”All the cabin concepts and floor plans clock in at under 1000 square feet. The smallest design isn’t much over 100 square feet, and passive solar, wood heating, “turniture” employment, pre-fabrication, and the ultilization of recycled and salvaged building materials, are all covered. Its just a really entertaining and well-planned, blue-collar, REALISTIC cabin book that doesn’t cater to millionares-only.I recommend this one very highly. Actually this round of books was pretty incredible- and you’ll hear all about several releases soon on my youtube channel. -Derek “Deek” DiedricksenAuthor of “Humble Homes, Simple Shacks…”Host of “Tiny Yellow House” TV"},

{"title": "Pete Nelson- A Treehouse Building Addict/Pro, and his words of wisdom", "date": "Wednesday, February 2, 2011", "text": "Pete Nelson- A Treehouse Building Addict/Pro, and his words of wisdom Over the past two months, in preparation for my new eventual book through The Lyons Press, I’ve talked to Pete Nelson of The Treehouse Workshop Inc. many times. Pete is the author of SEVERAL books on the subject, has built countless extravagant and ultra-cool tree homes, and is certainly a man in love with his job. You can check out his company The Treehouse Workshop HERE. When asked about some treehouse basics, here’s what Pete had to tell me/us…First of all know that in building a treehouse you are building in a dynamic, living thing.  We mean to keep everyone involved healthy and happy, and to respect the tremendous forces that are often involved.The tree to house interface is accomplished best through the use of Treehouse Attachment Bolts (TABs) also known as GLs or Garnier Limbs.  TABs are large lag-style bolts that  have a 3″ diameter “boss” similar in size to a beer can, mounted about 6″ up a 1-1/4″  diameter by 24″ long steel shaft (lengths vary).   The six inch end and approximately half of the boss is inserted into the tree, and the remaining shaft sticks out of the tree horizontally.  Currently these bolts are available on several specialized websites, but they are not patented and can be fabricated at any good machine shop.  Exact formulas for proper fabrication is listed on engineer Charles Greenwood’s www.treehouseengineering.com website. The simple beauty of these bolts is that they can support incredible loads, and that the trees don’t mind them.  Depending on the type of tree, they can support between 8-12,000 lbs.  And trees absorb them as they do their own dead branches. The next area of importance is to be sure in a multiple tree situation that the trees can flex and sway independently of each other. Simple heavy-duty hardware solves this challenge.  Have a look at some of the websites or my treehouse books to understand the principle, but basically I anchor one end of a large beam, perched on top a TAB, with a “static uplift arrestor”.  The other end of the beam will need to flex along its axis and is therefore connected to the top of the TAB with a “dynamic uplift arrestor”.   Typically there is a 7″ “throat” on my DUA’s, but if you expect your trees to move more than that simply expand the throat.  If you are high up in a group of two or more trees, you can use the TAB to hang a cable or chain from and thereby attain far more flexibility.—————————-Well, from Pete himself, there are some of the basic rules of thumb- subjects which is GREATLY elaborates on within his collection of books on the topic.As for our own Relaxshacks.com 2011 Tiny Shelter/House, Hands-On Workshop- we are going to collectively build a structure- and I’m leaning towards a treehouse/tree-shelter as of lately- we’ll see. Ultimately I might turn to the attendees to see what THEY want to help out with. More info on our workshop is HERE….

We’ll probably leave this around long enough for the attendees of my 2011 Relaxshacks.com Hands-On, Tiny Shelter/House Building Workshop (here in MA) to check out too (along with 3-4 other mini cabins on my property).I additionally shot a mini video or two on this which I’ll post down the road. I’ve also been working on this in the snow- and I mean LOTS of snow, and negative-degree temperatures. I think its safe to say that I’m looking forward to warmer weather! 'WITH the stained glass window- art by Stephanie Atlee aka \"Satialee\" on Etsy.com- she's awesome! We also just shot a REALLY cool/fun video for Make Magazine, and hope, perhaps, to shoot one on “The Tree-Rex” should they be interested- it’d be pretty hilarious.-Derek “Deek” Diedricksen"},

{"title": "Shantyboat Interview With Seattle's Bryan Lowe", "date": "Saturday, January 15, 2011", "text": "Shantyboat/Houseboat interview with Seattle’s Bryan Lowe A Shantyboat/Tiny Floating House Interview with Seattle’s Bryan Lowe  (by Derek “Deek” Diedricksen of Relaxshacks.com- originally for Tinyhouseblog)     Bryan Lowe ordered a copy of my book “Humble Homes, Simple Shacks…” a ways back, and as in many fortunate cases with those who have done the same, it became a common ground on which we began emailing back and forth on our love of tiny shelters/houses, and more specifically, shantyboats. Bryan too, is Harlan Hubbard obsessed (I’m telling you READ “Shantyboat”- its pretty amazing/gutsy).                       Well, back on track, it only seemed fitting to grab an interview, for all to read, from a guy who actually runs the blog http://www.shantyboatliving.com, so here you go….And thanks to Kent Griswold, for helping to spread the word as well, and to the many other friends that are part of this whole community (can I get a “Whoa Bundy!?”). Ahem….cough….bad eighties references aside, here’s our “yap session”…..     BACKGROUND INFORMATION: Hi, my name is Bryan Lowe. As for a little backstory on me, my grandfather built himself a couple of boats, most likely 17 to 24 foot GlenL designs that he used for fishing all over the western US.  My father built the house I grew up in, all seven of us, which also included a “garden room” made from scrap lumber and windows from a tear-down as well as a blacksmithing set up in the backyard.  I grew up thinking building stuff is what you do, and it’s a given that you try even though you don’t know how.  My dayjob is as Program Director for KING FM, the classical radio station In Seattle, a job where I spend much time in concert halls and fundraising dinners.   At night, in my other life, I am much more “shanty” in my approach, driving an old meter maid scooter and build shantyboats in my garage.Deek: Now Bryan since you drop the self-describing term “shanty”, aside from “WHY “shantyboating?”, is there a certain criteria by which a structure can be called a “shantyboat”. Is there much of a difference from them to “houseboats”? Its rudimentary, but to some reading, there might be some confusion that needs alleviating as there seem to be thin lines of definition between the two.                                                 Bryan: Well, In the dictionary shanty means a small crudely built dwelling, so a shantyboat would therefore mean a crudely built boat, and that is a part of it, up to a point.  No shanty has gold plating, literally or figuratively.  These are simple craft, homebuilt by untrained builders, with an eye toward extended stay, such as your life allows.   For a few, it’s living aboard in some backwater full time.  For most of us, we build our simple craft and grab as many weekends as we can, always dreaming of a future time with expanded shantyboat living.  The line between houseboat and shanty is always subjective.  There are a few givens: you can buy a houseboat but you can’t buy a new shantyboat.  A houseboat can be built with virtually unlimited resources, but a shantyboat almost requires a little pragmatic scrounging.   And finally, there is intent.  Are you trying to recreate a home that just happens to be on the water, or create a homebuilt replica of a commercially built houseboat?  Shantyboats aspire to a different aesthetic.  They can be cute, they can be painted, they can be cozy, but there must be no mistaking them for commercially built.  A shantyboat is handcrafted by it’s owner, with care, with affection, and with a decidedly pragmatic streak!  Shantyboats are square, they have edges, with no effort to make it more aero or hydro dynamic.  In the end it’s like porn.  You know one when you see one, without doubt.Deek: Lets keep this PG Bryan! Kidding, kidding…Now give us a little bit on the set-up, and specs of your own, self-built shantyboat project, and the impetus and story behind it? Is this soemthing you designed?   A Shanty/Shelter-Boat from this blog author's book \"Humble Homes, Simple Shacks..\" Bryan:  My Escargot is an 18 foot long by six foot wide box, designed after the canal barges of England and France by retired University of Washington Architecture professor Phil Theil.  Phil likes pedal powered boats, and this one was no exception.   But when I built it I was the first to leave the pedal power off.  It just wasn’t practical.   After I took him for a spin he was convinced, and everyone of his larger designs since has included an outboard.  Mine is a 6hp 4-stroke that moves it at about 7mph.  I built it in my driveway with minimal tools, and with treesap and rain creating something of a mess of it at times.  By nature I am not a detail guy, and my life doesn’t really allow it, with boat building time usually grabbed for just a few minutes whenever possible after work and parenting.  My boat isn’t straight and I’ve never gotten around to that final detail work, but it works and I have used it for scores and scores of nights in small rivers around the NW.  It has a head, a rudimentary kitchen, a “living room”, and comfortable sleeping room for a couple.  There is a small deck or seating area at each end.Deek: Have you made any long trips or stays onboard?Bryan:  I built it to explore the backwaters, but without a boat I wasn’t sure where I could go.  I have a wealthy friend who took me up in his airplane and we scouted out the Snohomish River and the sloughs at its mouth.  It was perfect.  Lots of snags, a couple of rundown marinas and at least 25 miles of water rarely used by most recreational boaters.  I’ve spent dozens of nights there.   I’ve also been on the Skagit River and it’s estuary just north of Seattle and on a few small rivers between Seattle and Portland, including a few on the edges of the Columbia River. The longest I’ve been aboard is a week, but I’ve done that many times.Deek: Now aside from your own site http://shantyboatliving.com what are some other sources we can tap for information on these boats and/or available designs? I’ve been to The Duckworks Magazine site a bit, and have read all the Harlan Hubbard Shantyboat books- which I can’t recommend highly enough- but what else is out there? It seems a VERY untouched/underground movement.Bryan:  It is untouched by the mainstream, but the Yahoo shantyboat group I founded is getting close to 1000 members.  THAT group is the best resource there is, for there are a good number of folks there who are living the life or heavily into the dream.  And they won’t tell you it can’t be done, or argue whether it’s a shantyboat or not.  These are good guys who understand the lifestyle and the dream.   Those books you mention are must-read items.  You’ll find inspiration on Youtube as well.  Search google images as well.  And then be sure to share what you are doing through our Yahoo group or with your own website.  Be a part of the sharing.Deek: So much like the tiny housing scene, its an open forum of people willing to help one another- that’s great- and the way it should be, rather than competitive. Now, what about codes, legal hassles, and neighborly/sea-worthiness concerns/complaints? Does creating and owning a shantyboat come with its own set of woes from lawmakers and local citizens, as say, the houseboating communities of Seattle have regularly seen?Bryan:  You must live beneath the radar, and that isn’t possible in the “nice” places in town.  But I’ve never been hassled in any river I’ve been in, nor I have seen any of the authorities out there.  Get a license if you fish, and that is about all they care about in the waters I hang out in.  Don’t pour sewage overboard or leave garbage lying about.  My boat is painted up like an english canal boat, or some think it uses Rastafarian colors, it doesn’t really blend in.  I think there is strength in that.  Most people come running to take pictures when I come around the bend.  I feel I am a welcome part of their day.  At night  I never park where I can be seen from a home, and I never stay in one place too long.   Keep your boat small, keep it clean, add a bit of color through flags or banners, and then wave and smile.Deek: So basically, keep things clean, friendly, and don’t mount any canons onboard. Got it. What’s next on the project slate for you? Or “trip” slate? Any planned once the warmer weather returns?Bryan: Well, aside from many things, I’ve also started a Micro-shanty project, a boat just 8.5 feet long and 4 feet wide.  It will sleep one and includes all the basics in one little craft, with room enough to read, to write, cook, fish, and explore.  I’m a big fan of keeping it small.  The bigger you get the more complicated your life will be.  I’ve additionally planned a small boat get-together on the sloughs of the Snohomish this Summer and invite anyone to join me.  True to the shantyboat style any boat will do, though be sure it doesn’t draw much water and can handle hitting a snag or two.  Heck, It can be a rowboat with a 2 by 4 holding up a canvas tent.   We never go faster than idle, we don’t drink in excess, we must be self containted, as there is no land to pitch a tent, and we must have no plan other than to live the shantyboat lifestyle for a week.  Learn more at WalterMittyAC.com, another site I’ve made, where we talk about adventures for regular folks.  Its The Walter Mitty Action Committee.I’m also working on a book not unlike what you’ve done with tiny architecture, though without the artistic touch, as I have no talent for drawing.  It will be a book about the lifestyle and how to do it.  Self publishing, most likely, this Summer.  If you have any advice I’d be delighted to hear it! Any readers of this too.., Thanks so much Deek!Thanks to Kent Griswold for originally running this interview on http://tinyhouseblog.com"},
