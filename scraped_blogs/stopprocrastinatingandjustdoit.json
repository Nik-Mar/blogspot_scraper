{"title": "The Platinum Jubilee ", "date": "Sunday 29 May 2022", "text": "Hard to believe it's 70 years since the coronation. I remember it well, it was the time that the sales of televisions really took off, that we collected royal photographs at school to make scrap books, we got new dresses to wear for the day & were given coronation mugs. I'm not an ardent royalist but have to say the Queen has been an admirable monarch, we won't see another with her qualities. Tonight I watched a delightful programme on telly about her. The BBC's The Unseen Queen shows the Queen & her family's private life in videos, many of the photos & videos were taken by the Queen herself & her family & have never been shown publicly.                   There are extracts from a number of her speeches and some lovely comments & quotations which show her wonderful qualities & strength of character.My favourite quotation she used is this Australian Aboriginee proverb:        We are all visitors to this time, this place, we are just passing through. Our purpose here is to observe, lo learn, to grow, to love .... and then we return home.Watch it if you get the chance, it's well worth it compared to the depressing stuff we're subjected to."},
{"title": "Fettle Those Finishes!", "date": "Wednesday 16 February 2022", "text": "Just in case you're wondering what \"fettle\" means well in this case it means to sort and complete the unfinished things I've started that are lying about the place. I came across the idea here on the lovely Archie the Wonderdog website. It's basically a group of people linked by that picture above who are fettling their finishes. I'm hoping that joining this link of people doing the same thing will spur me on when I see how they're doing. Well that's the idea.I started to go through all the items I've started to make and are now languishing in the place I call the \"sewing room\" (it's not just for sewing)  and there's so many so I'm making a list. That should shame me, Catholic guilt no doubt!The list isn't comprehensive and it's limited to sewing!!!!I apologise for the photos, some are terrible as mostly they're from my Nokia phone which isn't fantastic & neither am I at using it! Must get a new USB for my camera!THE LIST1. Log Cabin Square - Started about 2 years ago I started this about 2 years ago after I found an old BBC Book which had covered a TV series on patchwork. It's been lying about as I couldn't decide what size to make the cushion. Like Topsy it just growed! Eventually I stopped at 26\" but needed a backing & at that point the Lockdown started. So it's been lying around since then. Now I think I might make it into a firescreen cover as I've got sick of the existing embroidered ship picture. If I make it a loose cover I can change it, maybe at Christmas. Well that's the current thinking.2. Campervan Cushion - Started early January 2022 A friend gave me this piece of fabric which is sweet. Just the size for a cushion but trying to decide how to quilt it!3. Bag for the Rulers - Started 3 years ago                               I started making this as I needed something to hold my rulers when I was going to classes. The idea came after I saw someone break a big expensive ruler in the boot of her car. On a trip to one of the Harrogate quilting exhibitions a friend & I had bought one of those rolls of 2½” fabric strips which was cheap. However it wasn't the bargain we thought as the strips were not too straight. My friend had stitched hers into two large rectangles to make a big bag to hold her rulers. So I decided to do the same. At the moment it's two pieces of quilted strips waiting for the lining & straps to be added. 4. Hexagon Sewing Case - Started December 2021On the web I came across a lovely lady, Emma. She makes beautiful items mainly using Liberty fabrics. She is absolutely delightful, her videos are so inspiring and she is so calm and clear in her instructions on her website Vintage Sewing Box. I'm adapting my sewing case from one she has made and using some of my Liberty Tana Lawn to make the teeny tiny hexagons on a lovely chambray I've been saving.   5. Numerous Hexagons - Started abut 4 years agoGoodness knows what I'll do with these, I just keep making them now and again. There's LOTS more!6. Little Quilted Sewing Case - Started summer 2020I needed a little sewing case to carry a pair of scissors, seam ripper, hold pins & needles & maybe some embroidery threads. Started this & got sick of it. 7. Some Purple & Green Squares? - Started December 2018Made these when I first started a quilting class then I left them. No idea why think I just forgot about them & no idea what I'll do with them. Yet!8. Christmas Yo Yo Picture  - Started October 2020A couple of years ago I saw this lovely Christmas picture made from rich silky fabrics. Took me too long to collect the fabrics so I put them away & then winter forgot about them until I pulled out the box with all my unfinished stuff for this list! I have about twenty yo yos (or Suffolk Puffs as some people call them) made!9. Foundation Paper Piecing - Summer 2019 I haven't taken to FPP,  I find it a struggle. I'm sure it's down to my lack of spatial awareness which seems to deteriorate as I age.I tried a couple of cat ones but didn't have much success. This was a mystery pattern from a German lady. I have sewn a few pieces but gave up. I must try harder!No idea what I'll make with it, I just liked the picture. 10. Mini Quilt - Mini Quilt - Jenny of Elefantz - Started Summer 2019I love Jennifer's website she has a wonderul way of writing about her family life in Australia and her faith. She is really inspiring and has lots of free patterns for quilting and embroidery as well as fantastic recipes. It's a real treat to read her blog. This is Jenny's photo of her mini quillt. It's a mixture of patchwork, applique & hand quilting. The pattern is free here on her blog.This is as far as I've got. Hopefully it will eventually reside in my downstairs loo!12. Christmas Cushions - Started December 2021I've already completed one in traditional colours here but fancied trying softer shades. Not so keen on the blue one but will need to finish it. 13. Sanderson Star Cushion - Bought Pattern - now awaiting fabricI bought the pattern for this cushion at the Northern Quilts Exhibition at Bowes Museum last month & am waiting for the fabric to be delivered. The pattern is still available on the Bowes Museum Shop for anyone interested in handquilting. It's a bit ambitious for me but I want something to sit and quilt at night when the evenings are light.Maybe this one should be in the Waiting List as it hasn't really been started yet but I'm trying to avoid starting any more things.  14. Multiple Cross Stitch things!I'm ashamed to say I have loads of these and some are over twenty years old. At least my sewing stuff isn't that old! I doubt I'll get many of these finished but I'll try. Hopefully I'll finish some of these items on my list and report back on my progress. Well that's the idea!Think I'll finish now & will go and check on my fellow \"fettlers\" to see how they're getting on."},

{"title": "A Sunday Morning Autumn Walk", "date": "Monday 11 October 2021", "text": "My daughter asked us to look after her dog Esther this morning. It was such a glorious morning we decided to take her for a walk. Can't believe how sunny and warm it was for October, hardly a cloud in the sky.These are just some random photos I took along the riverside walk. My camera is still on the blink so I used the phone although its camera isn't brilliant. I must remember to remove the Nokia watermark from the phone and ask Santa Claus for a new camera!My main worry would be what if the river floods! The houses on the opposite side are nice too but there's a road in front of them.There's a lovely park and lake nearby but today we were just following the river as we've never walked this far along the riverside. It felt like being in The Lord of the Rings scenery. The trees were amazing. They would have looked better if I had stood still to take the photos instead of trying to keep up with my husband and the dog.These roots were totally weird but I would have loved to hide in their when I was little.Apparently that viaduct was built in the 19th century for the main London to Newcastle railway. I wanted to take a close up photo as the blocks of stone were absolutely huge but the trees were blocking the view when you got near it. Maybe we can get a better photo next time from the opposite bank of the river. Don't think we'll get such good weather again until next year."},
{"title": "It's Knitting Time & Time to Learn Something New!", "date": "Friday 1 October 2021", "text": "Free Digital Longline Hooded Cardigan Pattern Well now the nights are cutting in seems like time to start knitting again.A few months ago I went a bit doo-lally and bought loads of wool in a website sale. I still say wool, can't get out of the habit & call it yarn which shows my age!Last week I thought it was a good time to get that big box of wool out of the bedroom & get cracking! I saw the free digital pattern when I bought the wool and have started knitting it. Might get it finished if I can keep going with the back & fronts that I decided to knit in one piece up to the armholes so that I didn't have to stitch up the side seams. Not the best of ideas as I don't like knitting on circular needles so in Double Knitting the stitches (over 240) are squashed tight which makes it hard to see if I make a mistake. I do make them because I am usually watching telly when I knit. The second problem I had was joining the new balls of wool as there are no side seams and no joins at the the front ribs. So this is where I learned something new! After 70 years of knitting there's always something to learn. I did a bit of research on the \"tinterweb\" and found some good videos showing you how to spit or split splice. They work best on pure wool but after trying a couple of methods I liked this one by Suzanne Bryan best and have used it three times on acylic now & you can't see the joins which is amazing. It did take a fair bit of rubbing in your palms to get the friction as I have cold hands but the result was good.Only 4\" to go now! I'm making it a bit shorter than the pattern as I'm not very tall. I think I'll be making the sleeves shorter than in the picture too.I can't find the pattern in Ravelry so I've used the link to it HERE on the Deramores website where I bought the wool. They have quite a lot of free patterns for knitting & crochet and some great Christmas patterns if you haven't already seen this site.I'm not on commission by the way!Update!Finally finished it!I had problems with the hood. Didn't like the size of it so took it out and started again. I did that twice but still didn't like it so I got out a hoodie and used that as the shapre and knitted it to that. Thankfully it worked.I still haven't worn it. For some reason it feels fractionally small. Not the length, the arms could do with being an inch or so wider. Might be because I've been wearing really baggy jumpers for a few weeks. It's probably be more of a cool summer day cardi!"},
{"title": "The Cruise", "date": "Sunday 26 September 2021", "text": "Port of TyneWell we did get on the cruise after all, Scotland lifted their restrictions to cruise ships entering their ports a few days before we sailed. I should have posted this earlier but have only just managed to download the photos!I don't have many as we couldn't get off the ship in Shetland and it was a bit misty so the photographs from the ship there were poor. Well we haven't sailed from the Port of Tyne since the 'eighties when we took the car & sailed on the DFDS ferry to Sweden for a log cabin holiday which was great. Now the ferries only go to Amsterdam so we haven't bothered but maybe we should try a trip next year. but without the car. It's a really small port which is nice to sail from, no horrendous traffic jams or huge queues!It was an easy car trip to the port about 45 minutes, should have been 30 but the roadworks struck again as they always do on main roads in the UK in summer. There was an absolutely huge marquee set up in the ferry terminal car park to do the Covid testing which was fairly quick and very efficiently completed.We boarded and went to our cabin which was smaller than ones I've had before but it was clean with a small balcony, adequate storage, a big shower & the essential kettle, tea & coffee! This was a Tui ship with primarily UK passengers so they know our habits of needing kettles! It was good sailing out of the port, a lot of new houses and offices have been built along the river. Wish my photos were better!I've never sailed with Tui or Marella cruises as they are called now and I'm not doing a cruise review here as there are lots of them around on the cruise sites. What I will comment on are the things that struck me sailing in a time of a pandemic.There were numerous regulations which had to be adhered to and the ship was only half full as they weren't booking the inside cabins. Not sure I could hack one of these at the best of times we like a bit of fresh air especially in the morning and we hate air conditioning. You had to wear a mask walking around the ship, in the shops, theatre and only four people at a time were allowed in the lifts. You could take your mask off once you were seated in a restaurant or cafe but had to put them on if you got up to get food. All food, drinks & cutlery had to be served by staff to you even in the buffet and cafes. This seems a great idea & one that they should continue with to reduce the problems of the common Norovirus on some cruise ships.They were not allowing people off the ships in the ports we were sailig to unless you were booked on a ship's excursion. I suppose this was to minimise the risk of bringing infection back to the ship and we knew this before we booked. The only ports we were visiting were all Scottish, Invergordon, Dundee and Lerwick and to be truthful we weren't bothered about going on the ship's excursions. It was great just to be on holiday with no shopping, cooking or housework and watching the sea from the balcony.We did an excursion to Glamis Castle in Dundee which is the home of the Earl of Strathmore and it was the home of the Queen Mother before she married King George VI and Princess Margaret was born there.Glamis CastleIt was the inspiration for Macbeth as King Malcolm II was murdered on the site of the present castle & Macbeth became king in 1040. The building of the castle as we know it today began in 1400.It's not a huge place but it is rather sweet and it was really good to see the rooms which are exquisitely decorated and furnished.I loved the ceiling in this sitting room, sorry the photo isn't very good. Think my camera is on its last legs.Not sure how they kept it warm, the room was huge.The little chairs in the fireplace belonged to the Queen & Princess Margaret.Early sketch of Queen Elizabeth, the Queen's mother.Another smaller sitting room.This was the Queen Mother's bedroom. The cot to the right of the bed was the Queen's & Princess Margaret's as babies, the rocking horse too. This was King George Vl's bedroom.As the visit was during Covid there were no guided tours, we had to use an app to self guide. When it worked it was really good but it kept losing the information and you had to keep reloading so that was time consuming. There were lots of parts of the castle we didn't have time to see. You can book lunch there and it seemed reasonable, £16 for two courses, not bad for eating in a castle. There was quite a good shop and what looked like a great children's playground. I would have liked to see the gardens, they looked lovely and the estate is extensive but we only had about two & a half hours which really isn't enough.The North Sea was amazingly calm for the six days of the cruise. On the way back to North Shields the ship was moving so slowly that I was sure I could have swum faster!Just hope Marella operate more cruises from Newcastle next year.Sunrise, Port of Tyne, North Shields"},
{"title": "Tokyo Paralympics 2021", "date": "Wednesday 25 August 2021", "text": "Anyone else enjoying watching the Paralympics?Stayed up last night or rather this morning to watch the swimming and have to say they're absolutely incredible. Some of the levels of impairment are really high and you just wonder how on earth they manage to swim at all. They are so inspiring. The TV presenters are really good at explaining how the disabilities are categorised and the issues that the particular swimmers have completing their stroke.The back stories are great too hearing from their families at home and how they've fought to overcome their disabilities using sport. It's sad the families are not able to be in Tokyo supporting them but wonderful to watch.It's amazing that there are any British swimmers competing after all the swimming pools here have been closed to everyone for over a year. There are very few outdoor pools so they have had precious little opportunities to train until recently. Few of us in the UK have our own swimming pools and let's face it the climate doesn't lend itself to outdoor swimming in lakes or the sea. The only problem I have is that the broadcasts are not on the BBC so you have to suffer advertising. The breaks are annoying but never mind I'll just have to make drinks or go to the loo more often!Anyway I'm just going to enjoy them, they're amazing to watch. Source: International Paralympic Committee, Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons"},
{"title": "Shetland Here We Come!", "date": "Wednesday 21 July 2021", "text": "Jarlshof, ShetlandPhotograph courtesy of Tom Parnellfrom Scottish Borders, Scotland - Creative Commons licence A few weeks ago when our Covid rates were really low & I was feeling a bit low so I decided to book a short UK cruise up to Shetland. Well we'd had our vaccinations, all the rates were pretty low in the UK so it seemed like a good idea at the time!Well now I'm not so sure but at least everyone on the ship has to be vaccinated and tested at the port and it's an adult only cruise so we'll see.A few days ago we found out that Scotland wasn't accepting cruise ships from England even though everyone is vaccinated & a recent cruise has had its Scottish ports cancelled.It seemed daft as you can drive into Scotland, get a train or bus over the border whether you've been vaccinated or not and nobody checks anything. We have been expecting the cruise itinerary to be changed to English ports & have been waiting to hear what's happened to our cruise but have heard nothing from the cruise company.Well I checked the Lerwick Port Authority website which is where the ship would dock & surprise, surprise, from 19th July they are accepting cruise ships!So come Saturday if all goes well we'll be on our way to Sheltland. I'd better get the thermal underwear & the waterproofs out, it's never very warm there and they do get more than their fair share of rain! It will be some respite from this heat which we aren't used to.I lost all my photographs of my trip to Shetland in 2015 courtesy of Windows 10 & my BT Cloud backup. They may be there somewhere in the ether but I can't find them so thanks to Wiki Commons I found a similar photograph by Tom Parnell to one I had taken on a visit to Jarlshof. I think it's better than mine!"},
{"title": "A Good Kick up the Behind!", "date": "Thursday 10 June 2021", "text": "Well that's what I really needed but I knew I needed more exercise which would help my health as well as my mood. My ankles were swelling a lot and even the walking I forced myself to do wasn't really helping. I can't stand gyms and I knew I couldn't face the risk of going to the pool for a 30 minute swim so I found a great set of videos on Youtube.The exercises were reasonably easy (there's often an easy version), the trainer Lucy Wyndham-Read is really experienced, very nice, not a total fitness freak and they are very short, 7 minutes! You don't have to lie on the floor (I tried Yoga but can't manage lying down) and you don't need any equipment. There's lots to choose from at different levels and different lengths.Here's my favourite video, a run/walk in the mountains I've been doing them for a week. I have to say I feel a bit more positive & have more energy plus my ankles are not so swollen!Let's hope I can keep up the momentum doing these exercises!"},
{"title": "What a Wimp!", "date": "Sunday 30 May 2021", "text": "Photo Wiki Commons:Mike Pennington-Looking north from Sumburgh HeadHave to say I wasn't too sure how I felt about the lockdown ending soon, it felt safe staying at home and doing the shopping online. I have been to the hairdresser and had both vaccinations but hanging on to go to the dentist for a check up. I haven't been to church for months as you have to book online and then I'm not sure whether I'll pluck up the courage to go on the day. Watching services on telly is so much easier, I'm such a wimp!I do go for a walk most days but have to really push myself. I'm not too keen to go to a restaurant or a cafe just yet and I've only been to two shops in over a year. Been thinking I really need to make the effort to get back to a more \"normal\" way of life whatever that might be or I might end up agoraphobic! I was looking for a break in Northumberland or Scotland but the prices are quite high for a week in June or July just booking a cottage or a basic hotel even without breakfast was as much as a trip to Spain. Not that I want to go there yet!I saw that the cruises to Scotland from our local port had just gone online for the summer so I spent a while checking them out. Eventually I played it safe & just booked a 6 day cruise up to Shetland, Invergordon & Dundee in July. I've been to Shetland before & I know the chances are the weather won't be great but I'm not a sun lover so it will be fine for me & my husband. I think I just want a break from the housework & some different food that I don't have to buy or cook! It was just as cheap as booking a decent UK hotel although I don't even know if we'll be allowed off the ship. To be honest I don't care! I love being on a ship even though the North Sea can be pretty rough. Just hope by July I'll have more courage to go than I have now. Sorry the photo above isn't one of mine. I seem to have lost the ones I took when I visited Orkney & Shetland (courtesy of the Cloud when my computer went berserk the photos of that tour have all disappeared). I really don't know why I can't motivate myself to complete anything. I have to force myself to do housework & only the absolute necessities are being done! It's partly because I don't sleep very well & feel tired a lot of the time & maybe it's the beta blockers who knows! Even days when I feel OK I find things to fiddle about with on the computer or look at new patterns of things to make.I keep starting new bits of knitting & I have a big pile of sewing that's lying around waiting to be finished never mind the sail blinds I need to make for the conservatory. I need to get bits & pieces from the shops to finish some things but I can't pluck up the courage to go. The weather is really lovely now but the garden needs so much work doing before I can sit outside to knit, sew or read. I need a good kick up the behind to get me going. Now the lockdown is easing I'm hoping my granddaughter will want to sew with me now she's left school officially. That might help get me going. I've missed seeing family for over a year now but I'll be looking after my daughter's dog if they get to go to Disneyland in August so with that & the cruise maybe I'll get myself together again this summer. I can only hope & pray I do as I don't like the me I am at the moment!Take care, I hope you're feeling more chipper than I am!"},

We usually get the duff weather but not today!I'm hoping the nicer weather will get me going again. Haven't had the energy or the inspitation to do anything for months. Not really sure why, don't think the lock downs have created a mental health issue, could be an age thing but I think it's more than a touch of lazyitis, more like a wallop!Here's hoping I can get motivated this year, I certainly wasn't last year. Maybe the thought of being able to go to places will help. Well not too far away as a Med cruise or a holiday to Lake Garda which I really fancied are on the cards even if we've had the Covid vaccine.I haven't been to the Western Highlands of Scotland for a while so that would be nice, if they'll us in! If not it will have to be Northumberland or the Lake district, both are very nice.Time will tell whether we'll get anywhere. We might even have to do the garden and sit there! It certainly needs a lot of work doing."},

The first was 1970 the year my Mam died & my son was diagnosed with serious heart problems and now this year. Not bad I suppose only two out of over 70 years. This year has been OK for me & my family but I lost a good friend of over 50 years and a couple of other friends. It has changed our lifestyles but that's nothing compared to the grief and sadness brought to so many families with loss or being unable to visit relatives in care homes. My friend whose 100 year old Mum is in a care home has been unable to see her since March. She has fought for months to get the visits resumed as her Mum has deteriorated so much and they did resume two weeks ago but now they have been cancelled again.However there seems to be light at the end of the tunnel with the new vaccines which seem to be being given out very quickly. Just hope that it comes in time to save lives and restore some normality to the lives of those in care homes and their families. I look forward to 2021 and hope that people will respect the rules imposed on us so lives will be saved and together with the new vaccines people's lives can return to some kind of normality whatever that is.Happy New Year!"},
{"title": "The Tomb of the Unknown Warrior", "date": "Wednesday 11 November 2020", "text": "Tomb of the Unknown Warrior - Westminster Abbey (Photo Mike from England)Today is Armistice Day and it also marks the 100th anniversary of the day the Unknown Warrior was buried in Westminster Abbey. The idea of the Unknown Warrior came from the Rev David Railton, who had served as a chaplain on the Western Front during World War One. In 1916 he noticed a grave in a back garden in Armentieres which had a rough cross marked \"An Unknown British Soldier.The bodies of four British servicemen were exhumed from four battle areas, the Somme, Ypres, arras and Aisne, one was selected and was transported back to Britain where he was placed into a coffin made of two-inch thick oak from a tree which had grown in Hampton Court Palace garden. The coffin plate bears the inscription \"A British Warrior who fell in the Great War 1914-1918 for King and Country\". The warrior could be from the Army, Navy or Air Force, and from any part of the British Isles, Dominions or Colonies. He represents all those who were killed and have no other memorial or known grave.On 11 November 1920, the coffin was draped with a Union Flag and taken on a gun carriage to the Cenotaph, where the Queen's grandfather George V placed a wreath upon it. From there the coffin was taken to Westminster Abbey and he was buried in the west nave. After the service on 18th November the grave was filled with earth from the French battlefields and a temporary grave stone with the inscription:A BRITISH WARRIOR WHO FELL IN THE GREAT WAR 1914-1918 FOR KING AND COUNTRY. GREATER LOVE HATH NO MAN THAN THIS.The United States of America, conferred the Congressional Medal of Honor on the Unknown Warrior on 17th October 1921, it hangs on a pillar near the grave. The present black marble stone was unveiled on 11 November 1921 at a special service. It is the only grave in the cathedral that noone is allowed to walk on.More information about the Tomb of the Unknown Warrior -Westminster Abbey"},
{"title": "Finally Finshed a Quilt!", "date": "Sunday 18 October 2020", "text": "I haven't posted in a while, it's getting to be a habit unfortunately.Well last time I posted I was really disappointed that here in the UK the only TV channel we had that was dedicated to sewing was closing down. Well there was a massive reaction to it from viewers and the great news is that it has been resurrected with a new name Sewing Street. It's on Freeview channel 74 & I think it's now on Sky which is great & it's on Youtube too so that's brilliant news. I and obviously thousands of others responded to the closure and voiced our disappointment at the Harrogate Quilting and Sewing Show in Oclober so a group of designers and other staff from the channel have got together and it's coming back with some of the original presenters. Haven't done much sewing recently but have just finished a small winter quilt from some Robert Kaufmann charm squares I bought over a year ago & didn't know what to do with them. The fabrics are lovely shades of blue, grey and silver.Apologies for the photo quality I still haven't managed to find my proper camera's cable to download photos and the phone's camera is not brilliant. Well maybe it's me not the phone camera!I love the fabrics but had problems finding matching ones for the borders and to back it. I think the original must be out of production now so had to try some plainish ones. Probably better as the squares are pretty busy! I used the On Point pattern from the Missouri Star Quilt company and followed the video here. I love Jenny Doan's videos she's such a charmer. Trouble is she makes it look so easy but it's not! Well not for me anyway. So it's on to the quilt as you go with hexagons another idea I got from Jenny Doan. I didn't use the templates being shown just used my own and followed the method of making the hexagons with the layers of backing, wadding and top fabric layer. The Jenny Doan video is here  and she machine stitched hers but I'm doing mine by hand as I'll have a bit of manipulation to do you can see they're not perfect but I like them. Not exactly sure what I'm going to do with them yet probably some cloths for coffee tables or even one forthe dining table if I can manage it. Might have to make the hexagons bigger for that as the  ones I've made are only 3½\".  Well we'll see how it goes.Now I think it's time to do some stuff for Christmas."},

It was our 50th wedding anniversary last September but due to numerous health problems we didn't make the cruise we fancied in September so we booked to go to Norway this year.We were looking forward to the cruise as I haven't been to Norway for over fifty years and I've never been that far North in Norway. Nordkapp or the North Cape as we know it is the most northerly part of Europe & is the point where the Norwegian Sea meets the Barents Sea and I have to admit I was looking forward to it.  We're lucky living so far north in England with our lovely long light nights in summer, well when the weather's good it's light until after 10.30pm & the sun starts coming up at about 2.30am. We went for a walk tonight at about 9.15pm & the sun was going down & was brilliant but not the midnight sun.Never mind maybe next year but it's hard to tell what's going to happen with cruising or travel abroad anywhere. Maybe it will be Scotland, it's about time I went back there."},
{"title": "Keep Calm & Carry On", "date": "Tuesday 17 March 2020", "text": "It's a difficult time for all of us but especially the \"Golden Oldies\" amongst us who are most at risk.I think the most difficult thing about it is all the unknowns, how the nasty little virus is actually spread, how long it will take to go away, can you get it again, when will they get a vaccine, how can businesses survive. All really frightening stuff but the it reminded me of the saying that was developed during the war to help boost morale which was to keep calm & carry on.We've become used to so many nice things in our lives and quite a lot of certainties too so the unknown is truly scary. Yet our parents lived through much more frightening times. They had:No antibiotics to ward off the nasty infections we used to get No NHS to ensure we got free treatmentNo welfare state to support us in our old age, in sickness or unemploymentNo telly or phones & no internet No peace and a horrendous war to fightNo wonder they needed the morale boosting posters. Looks like we have a war to fight now which involves trying to keep healthy and helping others and ourselves to keep safe and sane too.Our daily lives have to change and it's a bit frightening not knowing how long this will go on. I'm sad to miss meeting up with friends for quilting, meeting my sister for lunch and friends for coffee, volunteering at the cathedral, going to church and not being able to see my children & grandchildren face to face. However we have so many good things in our lives to keep us going. Time to count our blessing and have some faith. I remembered the poem that Minnie Louise Haskins wrote that King George VI quoted during the war in his 1939 Christmas speech:  And I said to the man who stood at the gate of the year: \"Give me a light that I may tread safely into the unknown.\" And he replied: \"Go out into the darkness and put your hand into the Hand of God. That shall be to you better than light and safer than a known way.\"We're relying on governments and scientists to help us. However the Dean of Durham Cathedral has written to all the volunteers and he sent this prayer asking us to remember all the people who are affected by the virus and the amazing people working in the NHS helping to protect us.Keep us, good Lord, under the shadow of your mercy in this time of uncertainty and distress. Sustain and support the anxious and fearful, and lift up all who are brought low; that we may rejoice in your comfort knowing that nothing can separate us from your love in Christ Jesus our Lord."},
{"title": "Happy & Sad Day", "date": "Tuesday 3 December 2019", "text": "Had a great day last Friday when I went on a coach trip to Harrogate with our quilting group to the Knitting & Stitching Show. Now I love a coach trip, takes me back to when I was little in the days before nyone had a car & I went on trips with my Nanna & Granddad to various places for the day. We didn't have holidays in those days, no money around to do that other than maybe a couple of days to Blackpool to see the illuminations.I loved the atmosphere with families chattering, eating their sandwiches & singing songs on the way home. Well today we certainly did a lot of laughing & chattering & on the way home showing the stuff we had bought at the show.There were lots of smashing things on show or to buy. I didn't take my camera as I was trying to keep the weight of my gear to carry down so my phone camera's photographs are not brilliant & it was often hard to get near enough to take a photo. However the sad news of the day was we discovered that Sewing Quarter which is my favourite crafting telly channel is closing down. They show such great products & with some brilliant folks showing you how to quilt, dressmake, embroider, make bags & lots more. The programmes are all available on YouTube so doesn't matter if you miss one.I had noticed that for the last couple of weeks there has been mainly sales of stuff rather than the mix of how to make the things they sell. The sale of stuff is masquerading under Black Friday when really it seems to be a closing down sale.Well it's big shock as it's such a popular channel, we chatted to some of the designers & staff at the exhibitions & it's come as a shock to them too. Sad that so many people will be out of work just before Christmas.I only bought some dress fabric, a couple of little bag handles, the Sewing Quarter Advent Calendar & a Sewing Quarter Scissor mug in the photo above. I've opened three of the boxes in the Advent Calendar so far, I got a thimble, a brooch styled like a black Singer featherweight & today it was a seam ripper. Twenty two more to go! Just hope I am not tempted to go mad & open them all at once.I've opened them out so you can get a better idea of what they're like! The mug is lovely with rose gold finger holds like scissors. Very nice! Think the original price was £39.99 for the Advent Calendar & £8.99 for the mug. I got the pair of them for £10 at the exhibition, I wouldn't have paid the full price for them even though I do like them. For a tenner they're an absolute bargain!Now I just have to resist opening the rest of the Advent Calendar boxes."},
{"title": "Corpus", "date": "Saturday 26 October 2019", "text": "I have started to read eAudiobooks borrowed online from our local library. It's quite handy as you can listen to them on your laptop or phone & it's all free. I never buy them!I've never managed to enjoy reading ebooks on the tablet or the phone but I quite like being able to listen to the audio books when I'm knitting or sewing & it makes mundane housework like ironing much easier.The library doesn't have a huge range of audio books yet but it's improving. It's so easy to flick through their list & get a good idea of what the books are about & listen to the reader to see if you like their voice. I think I've been reading books that are a bit different to what I usually read & the book, Corpus written by Rory Clements, falls into that category. It's the first of three books & is a historical spy thriller set in 1936 as political events take place in Europe prior to the second world war. Stalin is unleashing terror in Russia, Spain is in the throes of civil war, the Nazis have marched into the Rhineland in Germany which was against the terms of the Treaty of Versailles after World War 1 just as the new King of England, Edward is making his decision about whether to marry Wallis Simpson or to abdicate.I enjoyed this book although the occasional use of the F word irritated me. Now will have to see whether the library has the other two books."},

{"title": "Welcome Back!", "date": "Monday 2 September 2019", "text": "Over the last few years I've really missed the posts from bloggers I used to enjoy following. Crumbs that makes me sound like a stalker!Some I've managed to check up on where they have an email and been glad to see they are OK. Many have gone over to Facebook which I know is not so time consuming but to be honest I always think it's just flashes of \"stuff\" that doesn't give a real insight to people's lives which blogs can do.Today I found a new post from BunnyMummy who posts such lovely photographs & great crocheting stuff. She hadn't posted for about 6 months so it was lovely to hear from her again especially as she had some brilliant photographs of Stratford upon Avon. Take a look if you have never been. I've only been once and it brought back memories of walking along the riverbank from the RSC Theatre and seeing a simple plaque on the grass below a silver birch tree planted in memory of Vivien Leigh. Sorry the photograph isn't brilliant, you may not be able to read it but it simply says, simply says:\"In memory of Vivien Leigh, Actress 1913 - 1961, A lass unparalleled\". It's at the base of a silver birch planted in memory of her.The words on the plaque come from Charmian at the end of Antony and Cleopatra when she describes her dead mistress:\"Now boast thee, death, in thy possession liesA lass unparallel’d. Downy windows, close;And golden Phoebus never be beheldOf eyes again so royal!\"Very apt!"},
{"title": "A Bit of a Day", "date": "Monday 12 August 2019", "text": "I posted back in January about being diagnosed with atrial fibrillation & how great the treatment I had in hospital was. Something like this is a wakeup call & has certainly made me think about things. I found a book my sister recommended called The Doctor's Kitchen - Eat to beat illness which was written by a doctor, Rupy Aujla who developed atrial fibrillation & didn't want to have the procedures that normally would be offered to patients with this condition. Basically he has written the book which he describes as \"a culinary journey through food in medicine\". He takes a holistic approach and looks at how food and your lifestyle can improve and maintain your health and there are lots of recipes too. The book isn't just for dealing with atrial fibrillation it's for everyone even those with no health problems.I've been trying to do some of the things recommended but changing your lifestyle isn't something you can do overnight. My main struggle is with exercise, I do swim a couple of times a week but I need to do more. I hate the gymn & our climate isn't always conducive to walking so I need to find another way to exercise.The main problems I have day to day are with sleeping, walking up the slightest of inclines, carrying bags plus swelling feet & ankles. Not too bad compared with a lot of people & I was resigning myself to making the best of it as I had decided not to have a cardioversion procedure which was offered. Basically they they give you a light anaesthetic, stop your heart & then give you an electric shock or two to start it which may get your heart back into a normal rhythm. I wasn't too keen on the whole thing especially the risk of stroke & the fact it's not always successful & may not last.Out of the blue I got a hospital appointent for the procedure & after some thought decided I was going for it as I was sick of having massively swollen anles & feet & was worried about the amount of medication I was taking. Well the day was today & with a lot of apprehension I was at the hospital for 7.15am. It's a new surgical centre which is really lovely, I had a lovely view of a little patio. I have to say the people were wonderful & thankfullythe whole thing went well, with one shock they got it back into rhythm. So it's thanks once again to the amazing NHS which gets so much unwarranted criticism.Now I have to wait & see whether it will last. Time will tell, but in the meantime I have to follow more of the advice in the book!Postscript:Sadly the atrial fibrillation returned last Thursday so we're back to square one just using the medication. Don't really like taking lots of stuff but don't think I'll go for any other procedures if the medication route works."},
{"title": "The Covers are Off!", "date": "Tuesday 4 June 2019", "text": "Durham CathedralThe Tower covers are finally off, the scaffolding is down after 3 years & the main tower is open again! This is what it looked like with the covers on and often a lot of stuff in front of it.It's sad that most of the time these lovely buildings have to have so much work going on which maskstheir beauty but it's the price of keeping them alive for future generations. Here's the BBC article about the work.St Mark's Basilica was covered for ages, I stopped taking photos of it when I was doing the Great Rail Journeys tours. I can't imaging what Notre Dame will look like as it is being renovated. Think it will take more than the 5 years they forecast but I'm sure they will do it even if it doesn't look like the original. It's hard to get the specialist people to produce the craft work necessary. Durham have their own team & train apprentices as I suppose all cathedrals do but the amount of work needed to renovate Notre Dame is colossal.Now there's lots of work going on inside Durham cathedral providing new entrances to improve access and to show more of the architectural features of the doorways which have been hidden. Hopefully it will be finished by Christmas.Today there were visitors from many countries including France, Canada, Australia & the USA. Hope they enjoyed their visit even though they are not seeing the cathedral at its best."},

{"title": "Computers!?*#?!!!!!!", "date": "Saturday 23 February 2019", "text": "Well when they work they are great when they don't!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I've had this laptop for a couple of years now & mainly it's been great. It wasn't too expensive, it's easy to use, fast enough for me & has a lot of storage. It has had one problem, the same one at least four times where it freezes and then won't boot up. This has meant taking it back to the shop to be repaired which is a pain, waiting a week or two & even more of a pain they wipe it so I have to keep reloading the software & getting all the settings back. Worse still they wouldn't tell me what had been the problem. All I was told was to leave it plugged in all of the time as it is set to do Windows 10 updates in the background & if the power is low it sometimes wrecks the update & causes problems. I thought that was the whole point of a laptop, not having to keep it plugged in all of the time!Well it is now out of the warranty so I thought I was stuck last night when it froze again. So this morning I went onto the Tinterweb (as you do) and found a video explaining what you can do when this happens. I had been loathe to do any fiddling about with the laptop whilst it was under warranty as companies use any excuse to get out of repairing things if you have had the back off stuff!Well I had to take the battery out which was a bit of a pain (not the easy external one) but I eventually managed to unscrew it slide it out without doing any damage and reconnect it again.Well it took a while to boot up (I held my breath) but it did eventually. Whew!!!!! Apparently some kind of a charge builds up (you can see I am non technical) and unplugging the charger & taking out the battery can sometimes resolve the issue. If it doesn't I also now know that there is a NOVO button which resets the computer back to factory settings. You don't get hard copy manuals now so if your computer isn't working you need a second computer or smartphone to access info on the Internet. Resetting sould be a bit of a last resort but worth a try.Well I feel a sense of achievement getting it working and it's a bit of a relief to know when it's my turn to do the church newsletter in a couple of weeks I do have a computer that works. Well it does at the moment!"},
{"title": "Blue & White Stuff!", "date": "Saturday 16 February 2019", "text": "I'm a sucker for blue & white stuff. I love it!Blue has always been my favourite colour. When my sister & I were little she got the pink dresses & I got blue, my choice!I use white crockery for everyday but my best stuff is blue & white willow pattern. I used to use that every day until Wedgewood in their wisdom stopped producing and I couldn't replace it.Blue doesn't seem to be very fashionable & it's often difficult to buy things for the house. I struggled to replace my blue carpets a few years ago, I could get a hideous bright blue synthetic one but wool was difficult. I eventually ended up with a medium grey, not as nice as my previous airforce blue one but OK.Blue has a reputation for being cold yet I find it very relaxing & fresh. It hasn't been in fashion for clothes though for  years, well other than denim which seems timeless. Odd but navy was out of fashion for donkeys years, I couldn't buy navy shoes, coats, jackets or dresses until a couple of years ago & I never wear black so it was a nightmare.I can never buy light blue jumpers or T shirts and it's not easy to buy blue fabric. Luckily blue wool is easier to buy and so is light blue cotton yarn, I've had some stored away for a few years. I had intended to make a couple of jumpers but never got around to it. A few months ago a lady from our charity knitting group gave me some white cotton but I had lots of other things on the needles so never did anything with it.Last week I decided to get cracking on making this. (It's a blanket not a cloak just in case you were wondering!).Well an easier version of it just using a single square to get it finished quicker.I've made twenty squares now so more than half way, I need at least 36 if I have enough balls of white cotton but I think I fancy joining the squares in light blue.Hope I don't get distracted and start something else before I get it finished! I'm a terror for doing that. I've just finished crocheting a shawl for a friend & a knitted chick to hold a Cadbury's cream egg.Currently I have a lace shawl on the go which I have been knitting for over a year now. It's been pulled out at least 3 times but I can't seem to accept that I can't finish it for some reason. I am also making another crocheted blanket made up of tiny little squares, that's an ongoing activity which could take years!That's not a photograph of my squares, it's the gorgeous picture from Annies Place Blog which got me interested in making little squares. (There are lots of great crochet ideas there.)I have two advent calendars half made which didn't get finished at Christmas as I was in hospital and a large Christmas stocking cut out. They can wait until next autumn.I have three replacement cushion covers for my dining room chairs to finish and at least four cushions for the living room cut out and ready to sew.Think I had better stop it's getting too depressing!"},
{"title": "Thank You!", "date": "Sunday 20 January 2019", "text": "Freda & FinchWell I'm feeling a bit ashamed at having such a long gap between posts but quite a lot has happened in just a few weeks. First of all I missed those cats I fostered in October so much that in early December I managed to persuade my husband to let me get them back, permanently. So here are the sisters, bigger, fatter & they settled back in no problem.Then 10 days before Christmas I had a rude awakening when out of the blue I was admittted to hospital with a heart problem. That was certainly a shock to the system as the doctor who admitted me commented \"You haven't been here since August 1973\". He was right, that was just for 48 hours when I had my daughter Claire & I have enjoyed really good health since then apart from a dicky underactive thyroid well controlled with medication.So what went wrong? I had noticed that I was having some palpitations, which I associated with needing a blood test to check my thyroid levels. The medication level was changed & I felt fine. Well until just before Christmas & one morning I felt dreadful.Turned out I have atrial fibrillation. This is the British Heart Foundation's definition:Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common abnormal heart rhythm that happens when electrical impulses fire off from different places in the atria (the top chambers of the heart) in a disorganised way. This causes the atria to twitch, and is felt as an irregular heartbeat or pulse. Atrial fibrillation is a major cause of stroke.I had never heard of it but it's very common apparently, especially in people over 80. Lots of people have it & lots have it & don't know. It was like having a bag of frogs jumping about inside me trying to get out. A bit like John Hurt in Alien!There doesn't appear to be any particular reason for me having it, my thyroid is underactive not overactive, I certainly don't drink excessively, don't do drugs, don't drink more than 25 cups of coffee a day & I'm not nearly 80! I didn't take kindly to taking what seems to me to be a lot of medication, a beta blocker to slow my heart down & a thinner to avoid a stroke but on the plus side it looks like I don't need any operations as thankfully there has been no damage done to my heart. Taking things easier & living life at a slower pace is difficult but have to say it's a good excuse for doing less housework & more sewing, knitting & crochet. As if I needed one!I'm so grateful to the NHS for the wonderful care I received both in hospital & locally at every level. I've never come across so many lovely people who all obviously enjoy their jobs & couldn't do enough for you, whether it was a cleaner, nurse or doctor they were all wonderful. I felt like writing a review for Tripadvisor for them! The NHS comes in for so much criticism but all I can say is thank God for it & all those amazing people who work for it.The cats have been a blessing too. They've made me smile at their antics & been a real comfort when I've been awake during the night. Cat stroking & listening to the purring is so therapeutic. Something like this is a real shock as I've always been so healthy & able to walk, swim & had no restrictions on my life. It certainly makes you rethink your priorities and be grateful & thank God for every day you have, even with its limitations. It could have been so much worse!"},
{"title": "A Sewing Machine Update", "date": "Wednesday 14 November 2018", "text": "A little while ago I posted Here that I had bought a little vintage sewing machine on eBay from a hospice. It was sewing a straight stitch well but I did notice that it was difficult to quilt using the walking foot as I realised the needle wasn't in the middle of the foot plate. I guessed it was something to do with the fact it wouldn't do a zig zag stitch & that the needle bar was stuck in the wrong place. The alternative was that something had broken off but everything seemed to move when I turned the levers.I contacted Helen Howes who runs a great website with lots of advice about restoring vintage machines.  She's a textile artist & designer & also sells lots of parts & I got my replacement Singer stitch lever from her. Her advice to me was \"oil, heat & wiggle\".So I oiled it yet again, blew the hairdrier on it a few times & eventually after about 15 minutes & wiggled the needlebar. Yes it released it & now it does some lovely special stitches including a lovely overlock stitch. Amazing!So I now have a lovely little machine that works perfectly, I contributed to a hospice and I'm helping to save the planet by not buying a plastic throwaway sewing machine. Feel a bit of a Heather Small moment coming on! Love this song.Still not used to that bobbin being under the needleplate though!

I had never heard of it before but it's an island off the Croatian coast north of Dubrovnic. Took quite a while to get there. A three & a half hour flight to Dubrovnic airport, a 45 minute taxi to the ferry, an hour and a half hour ferry trip & a 40 minute bus ride to the hotel. It was worth it with these views from our room's little balcony. The photos (not brilliant) are from my phone as I can't upload my camera photos to the laptop, can't find the wire thingy to do it. However you can still see how beautiful it is from these photos.I spent ages just sitting watching the various boats moving around the harbour.Every day there were boats berthing that were doing the Croatian island tours. I particularly liked to watch the daily ferry to Dubrovnic docking. It was in and out in about 10 minutes. Just look how clear the water is. You could see a lot of little fish but this camera wasn't good enough to pick them up.The water was quite cool for swimming but not too bad once you were in a few minutes.Hopefully I'll get my camera photos uploaded & show a few of the national park which was a couple of minutes walk from the hotel."},

Took me ages to make fitting all the different sections together, quilting it & then I added some beads so I'm put off from making another one even though I need another bag.

It's not exactly a new hobby as I've sewn for as long as I can remember, my Nanna & my Mam taught me when I was little so it's just another branch of that really. However it does need more stuff. Lots more stuff like cutting mats, rotary cutter, plastic rulers & shapes galore!I found a really great quilting group at Beamish Museum and I joined before Christmas. I was very wary as sometimes you join these groups and the people are not always very welcoming. You feel a bit of an outsider but this group of women were lovely. I went along with a friend just before Christmas and we had a great time chatting, learning to cut fabric with a rotary cutter and making a nine patch square. We saw the great quilted bags most of the group had made to carry all their sewing things to the class. The photo above is of the one belonging to the teacher.Oh yes we did a lot of eating too as it was their Christmas meeting so there was a lot of chatting & laughing. I was really looking forward to our next meeting which was yesterday and it was another successful day.

{"title": "A Little Frister & Rossmann Cub 4", "date": "Saturday 8 September 2018", "text": "Well here it is! A lovely little vintage sewing machine, a Frister & Rossmann Cub 4. It seems a bit like a toy one standing beside the Singer but it isn't. They were made in Japan in the 'seventies.It's a 3/4 size machine which despite being an all metal machine only weighs about 15 pounds compared to my lovely old Singer which weighs in at 27 pounds. I love the case it came in, you can just see it behind the sewing machine. It's is very lightweight compared to my wooden Singer box. The whole thing looks quite modern despite being made in the 'seventies, looks a bit retro with those cream & brown colours & the little band of orange logos around the case.It didn't come with any attachments other than it's foot control & the zig zag foot. That's not a problem as all my Singer attachments fit it. There was a little box missing from the front (you can use it to hold accessories) as you can see from the photo below.However that wasn't a problem as I got one really cheap on eBay so it's complete now. The box lid unfolds to extend the sewing area & there's a dinky little shelf that lifts up on the left side. It's all really sweet & a clever design.The only thing I really don't like is the bobbin loading. It doesn't load as easily as the Singers do with their top loading drop in bobbins. With this you have to take the little box out from the front and poke about to remove the metal casing which holds the bobbin. I find I have to tilt the machine backwards & lie it down to see what I'm doing. Another problem is that you have no idea how much thread is on the bobbin when you're sewing as it's completely hidden inside the casing & under the machine. What a pain! Never mind I'll get used to it, quite a lot of the more modern machines have this too.It sews a lovely straight stitch but it doesn't do any zig zag stitches. No idea why as it's been oiled and all the bits move except the needle bar. Maybe something is jammed in which case it may unjam as I use it. However it's very clean inside so it's more likely something has broken off somewhere inside. I've taken the base off & all that dropped out was a pin. I suspect that's why I got the machine cheap.I've looked inside but compared to the Singer the gubbins are packed in there tight & you can't see much, unlike my Singer where you can see all the parts. Also with Singer because they cornered the market with sales many people collect & repair these vintage machines & kindly share their knowledge by making videos & posting on blogs which help you to sort any problems out. Not so with the little Frister but I don't mind as I really only need a lightweight machine to take to the quilting group & to do a decent straight stitch. Any of the fancy stuff like zig zag & a few embroidery stitches can be done on my old Singer at home. I also really don't need the bells & whistles that come with a new plastic machine so will see how things go.There was a bit of a feelgood factor about this purchase. I bought the machine on eBay from a hospice so apart from being environmentally friendly & giving a lovely old machine a new home, the money was going to a good cause.UPDATEThis post was updated as I managed to fix the zig zag problem!

I can carry it OK but lifting it into the car & then onto the table is getting problematic. I thought about getting a new lighter one and looked at lots with all the frills bells & whistles, but lots of reports I read about them indicates they are not built to last. The computers go wrong & they are difficult & expensive to repair, if they can be repaired.  You have to go to the really expensive ones to get a decent build & I just don't feel the need to spend that sort of cash. I took some advice from an experienced quilter & she advised to avoid the \"throwaway plastic rubbish\" & go for a vintage Frister & Rossman Cub or an Elna Lotus. Neither of which I had ever heard of so what followed was hours of looking up information about these machines. I made an interesting discovery that none of these machines had the online information providing support, parts available & maintenance to help you look after your machine like you can with Singer. I suppose that's because Singer captured the market, their machines were the undoubtedly the best in those days and people still love them. There are so many resources to help you maintain your Singer that for most people it's their choice of machine. However the only lightweight vintage Singers are the Featherweights (mind you they're not that light) but the prices are now extortionate so I counted that model out.I couldn't find much out about these machines, how to maintain or repair them, nothing on Youtube other than a woman sewing rows of various stitches on the Frister & Rossmann Cub 4 & a few people on various fora saying they loved theirs. I took a bit of a risk tonight & bought the Cub 4 on ebay. It was very cheap as the accessories box that fits into the front of the machine is missing. Well it doesn't bother me as I won't have any accessories to put into it, they don't come with the machine. Must be still in the accessories box somewhere in somebodies loft probably. It does have the manual, the foot pedal & a decent looking case. I only want it to take to the classes so it doesn't have to look the business. I'll be happy enough if it sews OK & I can lift it. It's supposed to in good working condition & I only paid £24 for it. If it's rubbish I'll just think of it as a donation to the hospice selling it. Just hope my husband is out when it's delivered, not sure how I can explain buying another \"old\" machine.Just before I bid for the machine I saw a lovely Singer 99K available locally so I can go & look at it if I want to. I don't really want to be a collector of Vintage machines but I think I'm getting addicted.Watch this space!"},
{"title": "Joe The Quilter", "date": "Sunday 29 July 2018", "text": "Joe the Quilter's Cottage, BeamishQuilting has long been a traditional craft in the North East of England with the famous Durham or North Country Quilting.I have a Durham quilt which I inherited from my mother in law after she died. Sadly I know nothing about who made it or when as she never showed it to me. I'll do a post about it once I manage to take some decent photographs of it. It's so large I haven't found a way to take them.Beamish Museum has a lot of quilts and recently a new cottage has been built or rather re created honouring Joe the Quilter, a famous quilter in the North who was murdered in 1826.Joe the Quilter's cottage was in Warden near Hexham in Northumberland and the team from Beamish researched the site and recreated the cottage in Beamish. I had a half an hour to spare last week when we were doing our quilting at Beamish so dashed across to take a look at the cottage. Apologies for the quality of the photographs. I hadn't realised that we would be visiting the cottage so didn't take my camera. I must get to grips with the camera on my phone one of these days. Musicians playing outside the cottage. Note the little puppet the fiddler was keeping going while he played. Multi tasking!The interior was bigger than I expected but just a single room for living in!Behind that wattle & daub wall was where Joe kept his chickens! Wonder where Joe kept his quilting frame as it would have been pretty big.There was a small sample of Durham quilting in the window area. Main problem was getting a photo with all the other people doing the same thing. Tourists!Outside the cottage was a notice letting people know they could take part in an investigation into the murder!We took a quick look into the church (another building taken down & built up in Beamish). There were some quilts and some boards showing activities relating to the cottage & quilting.Small pieces of blue & white pottery were found when the archaeological dig was done and they were copied here by a local textile designer and artist.She then designed a lovely cotton fabric using her water colour print.Also in the church was a locally created new quilt. Couldn't get the whole thing into a single photo. I particularly like this square of the little town of Alnmouth.This isn't a very comprehensive representation of what it's really like at the cottage as I only had about 30 minutes to see it. There's a lovely video telling the whole story of Joe the Quilter's cottage here."},
{"title": "Durham Miners' Gala", "date": "Sunday 15 July 2018", "text": "North & South West Towers of Durham CathedralIt's many years since I went to the Miners' Gala or rather the Big Meeting as we called it. I was just little and I remember my sister got lost amongst hundreds of people on the racecourse, she was 3 years old & I'm not sure we ever went back. However I do remember the procession leaving the the Miners' Institute with the brass band & the miners' banner every year and then going to watch them returning home with crowds following the band & the banner.The event was a huge one in the life of the communities around the Durham coalfield celebrating their mining heritage and the miners' unions.  The colliery bands marched from the villages early in the morning arriving in the city where the streets were closed to traffic. They paraded in their thousands to the old racecourse where political speeches were made. Afterwards new banners were taken to the Cathedral to be blessed in a special service.Today I went along as I was working at the Cathedral, it was the 134th Big Meeting and the atmosphere was amazing. The weather was fantastic and it was great listening to the brass bands playing as they waited to go down the the old racecourse to hear the political speeches. Sorry my photos are not brilliant had to take them with a phone on the hoof as I wound my way through the crowds on the paths up to the Cathedral. They were taken at 9.30am as the banners and bands were assembling with the banners and waiting to march to the old racecourse. Unison (my union)Thousands more came to the old racecourse there despite the fact that there are now no deep mines in Durham due to closure by the Thatcher government in the 'eighties. There's no racecourse now either but that wasn't her fault!You can guess there were lots of things on the agenda today when Jeremy Corbyn the Labour leader spoke, education, the NHS, the importance of trade unions and yes Trump! I'm not a great Corbyn fan but I agree with what he said today, he reminded people that nobody gave us the right to vote or to be discriminated against. We had to fight for these things and the unions played a big part. It's a hundred years since women (over 30) were given the right to vote!Politics over!!!I was on duty at the Cathedral this morning for tours of the North West Tower which you can see here in the photo above. Note the colour of the grass, yellow in contrast to the older photo at the top as we have had no rain for weeks now. It looks like sand.The flowers are struggling to survive too in this heat.After the tours were over I decided to stay for the service for the first time and it was wonderful. There were five new banners being blessed by the Bishop of Durham and were brought in with their local bands. Four were brass bands with lots of children in them and the fifth was a pipe band (which I'm not a great fan of) however it was great. The sound totally filled the Cathedral and the acoustics were absolutely wonderful.The Bishop of Durham, Paul Butler gave a wonderful sermon reminding us that the days of terrible conditions working in mines are still with us. Apparently in the Democratic Republic of Congo child labour is used to mine cobalt, the mineral used in our mobile phone, laptop & electric batteries in cars. You can see more here in this CNN report. What a nightmare for these children & all for our lifestyle!It was quite an emotional service as many present remembered their husbands, fathers, grandfathers, uncles and brothers who had worked in the mines. All my male relations worked at Dawdon Pit a huge mine which had a massive output of coal. Both my granddad's & my husband's dad died due to pneumoconiosis. My Dad, all my uncles & my brother worked there as there were no other jobs to have in the town. Once the mines closed the effects were terrible, whole communities were devastated as there were so few jobs available.It was great to see that community spirit is still thriving in these places and thousands turned up today to celebrate the Big Meeting. The atmosphere as I said was great as I walked back down from the Cathedral into the city the brass bands were still playing around the streets and some people were dancing to Is This the Way to Amarillo?   Such fun!!!!!The police were in great humour too chatting to everybody & apparently there were only two arrests of local men who were drunk & disorderly! Roll on 2019 & the 135th Big Meeting."},
{"title": "Happy Birthday NHS!", "date": "Thursday 5 July 2018", "text": "Have to say Happy Birthday to the NHS which is 70 today.I must admit that I think the NHS is the best thing any government ever did for its people. To be able to receive treatment without having to worry about the cost was so vital after the war. I can remember my Mam talking about how hard it was to pay for to see a doctor. Like lots of families we were quite poor, my Dad became a miner after the war when he left the Royal Navy & there was no money to spare. The NHS was a godsend to people like us.What a fantastic & brave government that was giving people the right to health & social care benefits and despite many problems, thankfully we still have it today. Many people take it for granted especially the younger ones who don't know what life was like for people before the NHS.If anyone is a fan of \"Call the Midwife\" they'll know what a difference it made to people's lives.There's a lovely picture timeline here on the BBC.Nice one NHS, hope you have many more birthdays to come."},
{"title": "My Singer 338!", "date": "Sunday 11 March 2018", "text": "Well here it is my very first sewing machine, the one I got for my 21st birthday in 1966! I know it cost my Mam a lot to buy it for me & she traded in her Jones treadle to buy it. I wish I had offered to pay for to keep it but I suppose that's the thoughtlessness of youth.I learned to sew from about 5 years old with my Nana's Jones treadle, my Mam had learned to sew on it too & so did my sister. In the days before telly we spent hours sewing & knitting together. I remembered watching with horror the time my Mam got the sewing machine needle through her finger nail! Don't know how it didn't put me off.I decided I didn't want a gold watch for my 21st as most people did I preferred a sewing machine. I loved it! Such a gorgeous colour and my how it stitched! It could zig zag & embroider and it has made hundreds of things from my mini dresses, wedding & bridesmaids' dresses in the sixties, curtains, cushions, dresses & trousers for me & my children in the seventies & in the eighties I did a City & Guilds Fashion & Design 3 year course. My the machine got some hammer during that course.  Apart from when the electric foot control broke the machine never flackered until I got it out about a year ago & discovered there was a screw missing from the stitch lever. Just a tiny screw but it stopped the stitch setting working properly although you could still sew with it.Well I started a quilting class a couple of months ago & wondered whether I should treat myself to a new lightweight machine to carry to the classes as mine is quite heavy with the case on it.Next I spent hours looking at reviews on the Internet (as you do) & it looked as though most of the cheaper ones weren't worth the money. I didn't want to spend too much on one so I looked into getting the part for the machine. Well that was another hunt that took hours! Although the machine was made in Scotland it's hard to find replacement parts in the UK. I found one on a website in the US but it was going to cost a heck of a lot just for a tiny part so I gave up. I thought about buying an old 338 just to get the part but they all looked in poor condition on ebay & they weren't cheap either. So I was back to square one.I started looking at vintage sewing machine websites, by this time I was hooked on them, finding out more about them & how they were built to last unlike the pastic stuff being sold now. Well I found one UK website, it belongs to Helen Howes, a lady who is really into restoring these fabulous machines. Well she has some beauties which she has lovingly restored for sale here & I drooled over the Jones treadle machine I learned to sew on as well a most of the others here http://www.helenhowes-sewingmachines.co.uk/buy.html#machinesalesSo I started browsing the rest of the site & found she also has parts for sale. I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw the exact part I needed for the princely sum of £1! I rang her, she posted it to me & last night I fitted it & voila! It restored the machine to working order perfectly, now the stitch lever works like a dream. Hard to believe I could be so delighted, more delighted than if I had won the lottery. Can you believe a machine doesn't work properly, all for the sake of a tiny screw you can see here.So now I can start quilting properly! The sewing saga continues & I think it will have to go into the box with me when I go. Hard to believe you can get so attached to something mechanical but I am, I love it probably because I know it cost my Mam a lot to buy it for me back then. Then I think of all the things I have made or repaired with it, such memories. I hope Mam knows it was been worth every penny!"},
{"title": "Snow in Venice?", "date": "Thursday 1 March 2018", "text": "When I think of Venice I tend to think of blue skies & sunshine, most times I've visited that's how it's been. Although I have been there when it has rained but it still looks beautiful under grey skies.A rainbow over the lagoon looked really lovely.My husband has never been to Venice so I booked a few days there for us later this month. However at the moment it's snowing there! St Mark's Square is covered apparently so the expensive coffee shops are empty and gondolas must be having a hard time. Who wants to freeze in a gondola!Now photographs of Venice in the snow will be very interesting, I'd love to take some but I'm not sure my husband will appreciate more snow. We've had enough of it already this week!I don't like breaking copyright & pasting photos that are not mine but there are some beauties of snow in Venice here"},
{"title": "Cats!", "date": "Thursday 22 February 2018", "text": "After I lost Oscar I didn't want to replace him for a long time but I do miss having a cat. My daughter was the same after her cat Zara had to be put to sleep. However she decided she would get two rescue kittens and here they are, Ginny the tortoiseshell & George the ginger tom.                                     Claire bought a sort of  tree house for them & below George is coiffuring his tail in the top section. The cushion needed to be covered so I made a cover & then crocheted another multi coloured one to go on top. George laid claim to the top of the tree!It has a lower crescent shaped section & Ginny seemed to be relegated to it. I made a cotton cover but shrunk from doing a crochet one.Eventually I gave in & made a crescent shaped one. Not exactly perfect, I had no pattern. As you can see below it was an instant success & was much appreciated by Ginny! Mostly I have been knitting & crocheting with the charity craft group. I like knitting these as they can be made so quickly & look so sweet.It's hard to believe but this wool we have been using is really cheap and it's lovely quality. We've been getting it from Poundworld I think, I always get mixed up but I think Poundland do wool too. It's only £2 for 3 balls, amazing quality.I'm still struggling on with the gansey I'm ashamed to say. I'm blaming the bad light as it's very difficult to knit navy wool in artificial light. I make too many mistakes! Also the fact I hate doing circular knitting. I'm on to the sleeves now & have had to abandon the circular needle & go for a set of aluminium couble pointed needles which I can manage a little better but I still don't like thid type of knitting. Would have been much quicker to just knit the pieces separately & have seams, I never mind sewing things up. Also you can hide the ends of the wool in seams much easier! Now the days are getting longer I'm going to have to do more or pardon the pun I'll miss the boat!"},
{"title": "Roy Orbison", "date": "Tuesday 9 January 2018", "text": "When I was a teenager I had lots of lovely LPs with their beautiful covers and one of my favourite singers was Roy Orbison. I was lucky enough to see him a few times and probably the most memorable time was October 1963 at the City Hall in Newcastle when he appeared with the Beatles. We had bought the tickets to see Roy Orbison but by the time the concert came around the Beatles had risen to great fame.I loved the Beatles & their performance was great, well what you could hear of it. The girls were screaming and jumping on their seats but still I enjoyed the experience.  However when Roy Orbison sang you could a pin drop. The audience just sat throughout his performance watching & listening. It was on that tour that he struck up the friendship with The Beatles which lasted & he eventually joined the Travelling Wilbury's with George Harrison.Well I bought a Roy Orbison CD quite a long time ago which I have enjoyed but recently I haven't been listening to much music other than on the car radio. A few weeks before Christmas I was driving along listening to Radio 2 (I abandoned Radio 1 a long time ago, you do as you get older) and I heard Roy Orbison singing I Drove All Night but there was something different about the recording. The magnificent voice was the same but there was a longer orchestral introduction and the background music was much better than I remembered. It was from a new recording of Roy Orbison songs on a CD, A Love So Beautiful, produced with Roy Orbison's sons and featuring the Royal Philarmonic Orchestra. I remembered they had made a record last year with Elvis' songs which was really good. They've made a brilliant job of this one too with all my favourite songs. Strangely enough I Drove All Night wasn't one of my favourites but it is now.So the CD was my Christmas present and a fantastic one it is too. The orchestra doesn't overpower the wonderful singing it just adds another layer to it and really enhances all the songs. I love it and I bet Roy Orbison would have too.What I'm not so sure about is the holographic tour they are doing. I think it would be lovely to see him again performing with the orchestra but I'm not so sure how I would feel afterwards knowing it wasn't real. It's thirty years since he died and maybe it would be quite upsetting, almost like going back in time to when you were a teenager and then suddenly you're back to the present and ancient!"},

{"title": "Blue Planet 2", "date": "Sunday 10 December 2017", "text": "What a fantastic series Blue Planet II has been. The beautiful photography and wonderful presentation by David Attenborough has resulted in a fantastic series that entertains, educates and saddens us seeing what's happening to our world with the changes to the oceans.There are some amazing clips of strange things that happen in the sea. One memorable one is the poor king penguins tripping through & trying not to wake the sleeping giants. Another was of a fish that shocked me, it was the bird eating fish just leaping into the air and its mouth opening to swallow birds. Awful! You can see all the clips here. The final programme tonight was raising awareness of what's happening to our oceans and the effects on us all. Colossal amounts of rubbish including plastic is being dumped in the sea and being digested by fish so we will be eating the plastic they have digested. Sea temperatures are rising which is not just killing the life in the oceans but will lead to raised sea levels which by the end of the century will put huge areas of countries under the sea.  It's our everyday choices that can make a difference. I knew about this but watching a programme like this brings the horror home. Yet simple things like choosing cotton buds with cardboard sticks not the plastic ones, eat sustainably caught fish and if you live near the sea volunteering to help with a beach clean up can make a difference. That's something I plan to do in the New Year, I don't make New Year resolutions but I do make some plans & that's one.Another thing I currently do is being a bit more political and signing petitions. I get lots now from organisations like change.org, 38degrees.org.uk and sumofus.org. At least you feel like you have a voice and some petitions have been really successful. This is one good thing that you can do with the Internet in contrast to the awful things that it's used for.If you haven't seen the Blue Planet II series it's well worth watching.The future of our world depends on us & we can make a difference. On that pretentious sounding statement I'll finish!"},

{"title": "Is it really a month since I posted?", "date": "Sunday 5 November 2017", "text": "Old Key WestWell time passes so quickly especially when you're on holiday. Then you get back & can't be hassled to do anything other than sleep to get over the jetlag & eat!Also it's absolutely freezing & pitch dark by 5pm so winter is definitely here. We had just moved into Autumn when we left but that didn't last long. Had a good time in Disney World, much better than I expected. Gorgeous weather, lots of sun, not too hot, no horrible humidity & hardly any rain. We had a Disney apartment in Old Key West which was very spacious & peaceful. So thank you Florida.My main crititcisms of Disney are horrendous prices (yes they're getting even greedier) unbelievable crowds mainly in the Magic Kingdom (I've renamed it the Manic Kingdom) & earblowing music everywhere. It's in restaurants, cafes, parks, shops, hotels, buses & even on the lovely ferry rides. We had one ferry driver (not sure if that's what they call them) who said he refused to listen to it & turned it off. A great character!Why do they feel the need to blast music out everywhere? They've totally revamped Disney Springs (used to be Downtown Disney & awful) now it's much more spacious but even on a walk along the lakeside promenade you're blasted with music from lamposts with speakers every few yards. Why? We were looking for a nice little walk along the lake away from the crowds & some peace & quiet. No chance of that anywhere in Disney. It's such a shame, no wonder people wear earphones and rabbit on into phones all the time.Nice to get back home to utter peace & quiet! Shame I have to do housework though. It will seem an age until March when I've booked 4 days in Venice! Roll on the light nights."},

Well we were based there but were out touring for five of them!Although I've been there 5 times one place I never got to see was the Grotte di Catullo. It sounds like a grotto but it's really a Roman Villa or rather the remains of one. This time I made it & it's an amazing place, it's absolutely huge.It was difficult to visualise what it had looked like until I saw this noticeboard and then later went to the museum to watch a video about it. This is what it would have looked like. You can see how the villa was built on a sloping site which was no mean architectural feat. It was quite hazy day but you can see what fantastic views that family must have had from their home. The height of these arches was immense.Remains of a brick tiled floor.  You can see the depth of those floor tiles on the side.Well I've probably bored you enough with these photos.A coule of days before I walked along the lake edge below the villa and these photos are of the limestone strata where people were sunbathing & going for a dip. This gives you a better idea of what those fabulously wealthy villa owners looked out every day at.Well I have to go back there again but for a holiday!!!!"},
{"title": "Still Knitting!", "date": "Sunday 17 September 2017", "text": "I'm beginning to think I'm being a bit addicted to knitting. Normally I can just stop to do a bit of housework but at the moment I just can't put the knitting down.The pair above are part of a series of sets we're knitting for a school who want knitted toys for their Story Book Bags. No it's not the Teddy Bears' Picnic, it's for Goldilocks and the Three Bears. I've made the Mam & Dad bears who are sitting in our garden on a little blanket I made for the neo natal unit.  I opted out of making a pink skirt for the Mammy bear in case I was accused of being sexist!They are just waiting for little baby bear who a friend is knitting. She has already made Goldilocks & someone else is making the bag to hold them along with the story book.I've also just knitted a couple of blankets, baby cardigans & hats for our priest to take to a village in Zambia which the parish support. I always thought they wouldn't need knitted clothes but apparently it can be quite cool. I enjoy knitting these as it doesn't take long. The things I don't like knitting are the brown V neck tank tops for the orphanage in India. Brown was never my favourite colour! The gansy is coming on nicely I usually knit this for an hour or two in the morning when I'm in as I need good light. The light is getting poor now by about 7pm so it's going to be a few months before I finish.However I do need to be a bit more active as I've noticed my ankles are swelling with all this sitting! What a lazy cat I am! I'm off to Italy next Saturday taking a tour to Lake Garda so plenty of walking there to be done. Hopefully we'll get decent weather but I won't get any knitting done. You can't take knitting when you're working! I'm getting withdrawal symptoms at the thought of no knitting for a couple of weeks. Look at that grass in the photo, it's meant to be a lawn, neither of us are keen gardeners but it's too big for me to cut. Well that's my excuse!"},

{"title": "It's growing!", "date": "Saturday 15 July 2017", "text": "Well it's not going too badly.The rib was a double one & I decided to cast on using double wool to strengthen the edge. Eric's wool jumpers always seem to wear on the cast on ribs especially the sleeve edges. It did make it a bit bulkier but I hope it will be much stronger and last the length of the journey.Next came the Blyth Tall Ships logo which wasn't too easy to see in such dark wool. Definitely have to knit it in daylight.Now I am on a stretch of plain knitting for 50 rows. A bit boring but at least I can watch telly whilst knitting. Feel a bit guilty knitting during the day but needs must!The thing I really dislike about this is knitting on a circular needle, I find it a pain. The knitting keeps turning and you keep having to slide the loops over the cable join. Give me straight needles any day. I was tempted to buy a set of 4 needles but I'm not keen on that either. I did try to buy some really nice quality Knit Pro needles as I already have a cable but they don't do size 2.75! Never mind I hope I can get over it although I doubt that very much as I've used them a few times and just gave up. I don't have a choice with this jumper though, no seams allowed!Next stage is the waves, should be fun!Meanwhile the charity knitting goes on. I've knitted a couple of brown V neck tank tops as we used to call them in the 'sixties. Think they call them slip overs now. It's an awful colour to knit with dark brown, again difficult to knit in the dark. However it's for an orphanage in India & the jumpers will get dirty and dusty and won't get washed very often. So it has to be that colour for the poor little souls.Also still knitting for the neo-natal units in the area and the Apostleship of the Sea. These crochet little tops for tiny babies are quickly made and it's a nice break from the dark colours. The hats for the sailors supported by Apostleship of the Sea are quick & easy to knit too. Well back to the gansey while the light is good!"},
{"title": "A Trip Down the Grand Canal", "date": "Friday 7 July 2017", "text": "The first day I was in Venice in May I decided to take a vaporetto trip up the Grand Canal. Well it went up along the Giudecca Canal so I had to get off & get onto another to come down the Grand Canal!It wasn't a very nice day, in fact it was raining, it was just like being at home. But I still enjoyed it.Some of the photos are not too clear, the vaporetto was pretty full & it was wobbling quite a bit. Not sure how much it complied with European Health & Safety regs. I never saw any way that numbers were counted but I suppose it's not that deep! So I stayed outside ready to jump off if the need arose!I don't think the photos are in the correct order for some reason when I copied them into the computer they seemed a bit out of kilter but never mind.Fancy paying a fortune to go on a gondola trip when it's chucking it down! The chappies selling those ponchos did a roaring trade. The Rialto Bridge all refurbished.  It was totally covered last year when I saw it.A Venice wedding in the rain.I really love the buildings like these which look like they need a bit of TLC. They look so real not plastic copies.This is one of my favourites and I love the white arched columns. How great to have a boat outside your front door to pop out for a loaf or a pint of milk!It's not really sinking! They'll take them down when the Biennale is over. I think!Peggy Guggenheim's place!There were not many gondolas out on the canals due to the rain but I think they look good parked up.Back at St Mark's Square.  Not the usual glorious blue sky you see in the James Bond films & postcards.Now I couldn't fancy swimming in there, the water didn't look very pleasant but apparently Lord Byron did. He regularly swam the 4 and a half miles from the palazzo where he was staying on the Grand Canal down to the Lido. He was risking a lot as the canal was little more than an open sewer in those days. Well rather him than me!"},
{"title": "It's here!", "date": "Thursday 29 June 2017", "text": "My Williams Gansey Pack has finally arrived and it's brilliant.I posted about it a few weeks ago What's a Gansey? and it tells about the recreation of the historic voyage in 1819 where William Smith set off from Blyth in Northumberland and discovered Antarctica. Sadly he's never had recognition for this so the voyage in 2019 will hopefully go some way to changing this. I applied to be a knitter of ganseys for the crews who will take the ship Williams ii to Antarctica and was successful.There's absolutely everything you need in the pack to make the gansey. Wool, two sets of circular needles, a project book with all the information about the Williams Gansey Project including a written pattern, there's a diagramatic pattern, there's an envelope to post it back to them & even three pound coins to pay for the postage!The Frangipani gansey wool is beautiful, a really dark navy which seems slightly thicker than 4 ply but finer than double knitting. There's a huge 500gm cone and three 100gm balls. I'll have to do a test piece first to see what my tension is. It'll mean daytime knitting as I hate knitting dark wool in artificial light.  Thankfully it's very light nights for the next month or two so that will help.There it is sitting in its own box just waiting for me to start. So I'll just nip off now before it gets dark!"},
{"title": "Favourite Places", "date": "Tuesday 20 June 2017", "text": "Durham CathedralThere are some places you visit and they stay with you, they're so special.  This is mine!I've blogged about it before, probably more than once. It's a place I've visited since I was young and countless times over the years.  I can't even describe the feeling I get when I go there. I've Skywatched it too!This is part of the view I see when I'm returning home from my tours by train.  I know I'm home when I see it.  It has such a grand position overlooking the little city and has stood there for centuries surviving all kinds of events, wars, the Reformation and reminding us that it amazing people built it and have continued to maintain it for us for centuries.I decided this year that I wanted to do something to help share and pass on the love for the building that so many people have so I decided to become a volunteer steward to welcome visitors to the Cathedral. I spent my first morning as a volunteer yesterday and I can't describe how much I enjoyed it. There were so many visitors from all parts of the world and all ages; to help them enjoy their visit is our remit.  My face was aching from smiling but it wasn't a forced smile, I felt so happy speaking to visitors, answering questions (some I had to pass over to others who knew more about the Cathedral than I do) and listening to the other stewards and learning from them.  It was such a joy to be there I came home beaming and on a high!On Friday I'm doing a tour with a Cathedral guide so I will start the huge amount of learning I need to do before I'll feel comfortable in my new role. Meanwhile I'm reading up on the Northern saints, St Cuthbert whose shrine is in the Cathedral & St Bede who is also buried there.  Hope I can remember the dates people always ask about them.Wish I could post some photographs of the interior of the Cathedral but sadly photography isn't allowed without a special licence.  If you want to take a look inside you can here with photographs much better than I could take."},
{"title": "Venice", "date": "Friday 16 June 2017", "text": "I never tire of visiting Venice, I love it. It's one of the few places I love even if the weather isn't good. That's probably my favourite view, the island and church of San Giorgio Maggiore. I think I took that photo when it was clearing after a day of rain but it's still beautiful. I know some people don't like it, they moan about the crowds, the prices, the tat etc, yes they really do. Although even The Doges Palace & St Mark's Square look OK from the top of the bell tower on San Giorgio Maggiore despite the crowds.Another view from the bell tower. I just think it's gorgeous! Wouldn't mind a swim in that pool!I met a couple in Marks & Sparks cafe at home last week who were listening to my conversation with my sister about booking some flights to Venice as my husband has never been there. Yes I leave him behind at least twice a year to visit Venice & Lake Garda, for work! They interrupted to give their \"advice\" as they thought I hadn't been there before and they started to tell me how horrible it is now. I told them I have been a number of times & had just come back from Venice the day before and I love it. I said yes it probably is more crowded and expensive than it was thirty years ago, isn't everywhere? Not exactly the response they expected but each to his own I say, we're all different. They were definitely the glass half empty type of people!One of the worst places I ever visited for the tourist hordes was to the lovely little town of St Ives in Cornwall a couple of years ago. Well it would have been lovely probably at 6am before the hordes descended on it. It was absolutely horrendous, cars blocking the tiny streets (which really should be pedestrianised as they have a good cheap park & ride system) and heaving with crowds of people everywhere including lining the promenade sitting eating ice creams or fish & chips. You couldn't move for them. YUK! Give me Venice any day.Anyway back to Venice. The Venice Biennale had started a week or so before we arrived last month and there were lots of interesting pieces of art displayed across the city. I'm no art connoisseur and can only take culture in small doses so I didn't pay to go into the exhibition. There was so much to see it would have taken weeks! But I did enjoy seeing bits of art as I wandered around.Here are some of the photos I took of a few of the things that caught my eye over the three days I was there.Italian artist Lorenzo Quinn's installation called \" Support\" on Ca' Sagredo.  Weird but very effective!A bit gross, a man and a horse with a serpent wrapped around them.Our little ship, well boat really, was berthed right down near the Giardini where the main part of the exhibition was held. However just opposite where we were berthed there were two little parks with some sculptures in them. I liked the tortoises from the Seychelles.This was a bit weird. Some random bloke putting his dog on the sculptures to take its picture!I did like this one, it was huge and I could see it from my room on the ship. We were berthed just over the road from it. It's King Kong Rhino by Shih Li-Jen. No I didn't know that, the name was on the plinth!These looked like bits of somebody's spine!This one was ridiculous. Just loads of life jackets hooked onto a black metal circle!!!! Anybody could do that.  No idea what these were meant to be! Looked like bubbles on a stick.The next ones were my favourites. They looked so real, they even had wisps of hair sticking out from their bathing hats that were blowing in the breeze.No sadly the yacht in the background wasn't the one we were staying on!Now she is the one I kept thinking would step off the plinth! Notice I said she & not it.You could see the drops of water glistening on her and the creases in her bathing costume and the folds in her skin were amazing.You could see the veins on her feet and the even the follicles on her skin. I thought her feet looked really good but one woman said she could do with a pedicure! Have to say I wish my feet looked half as good.The work of Carol Feuerman an American artist and hyperrealist sculptor and definitely my favourites. It was great seeing all these works of art just placed in parks and outside buildings. A shame that some people didn't keep their children off them or their dogs!I'll take you on a trip up the Grand Canal soon! I'm getting back into the swing of posting now I have a decent computer."},
{"title": "Another road to follow", "date": "Sunday 11 June 2017", "text": "This is a place I love, Durham Cathedral. Lots of other people love it too, it's recently been voted Britain's best loved building, not a bad thing to be.When I'm travelling back from London up the East coast after my tours and I see it from the train, I know I'm home. It's often referred to as the greatest example of Romanesque architecture in Europe or as US author Bill Bryson described it \"The best cathedral on planet earth.\"I've visited it numerous times and I've probably posted about it earlier. Last time I was there it was being used for the production of the Marvel film Avengers: Infinity War and it was closed for some of the time which must have been annoying for those who had travelled a long way to visit it. So if you are an Avengers fan look out for it. Have to say I'm not but might go to see the film just to see the Cathedral. There were some additional bits of \"furniture\" there and all the benches had been removed which changed the look of it but essentially it was the same place.Over the last three months I've been there about 6 times and I realised I didn't really know a lot about it. Mostly over the years I've gone for a carol service or just wandered around with the children and grandchildren taking in the atmosphere mainly. I visited in March for a day where you learned about the Cathedral's Benedictine heritage; it was a Benedictine monastery until 1539 when it was handed over to King Henry V111. It is now an Anglican cathedral but it still carries on some of the Benedictine tradition of being a place of prayer and of welcome and hospitality to visitors just as it was when it was first built in 1093. There is no charge for visiting the cathedral itself unlike many other UK places of worship such as Westminster Abbey & York Minster; it is up to the visitor to make a voluntary donation. I find it offensive to have to pay to go into churches but I understand that it is expensive preserving them for future generations never mind heating & cleaning them. I hope there never comes a day when they have to start to charge in Durham.I decided recently to become a volunteer at the Cathedral to welcome people and help them get the most out of their visit. I now have to start the training which is extensive, there's a health & safety course, gaining knowledge of the cathedral and sadly a course in awareness of potentially dangerous situations and what action to take. I will have to do some guided tours of the Cathedral to pick up more about the architecture, the history of how it was built as well as more knowledge of the Northern saints who are buried there. Just hope my brain is up to all this and I can blog more about my progress."},
{"title": "What's a Gansey?", "date": "Wednesday 22 March 2017", "text": "Photograph courtesy of Tyne & Wear Archives & MuseumsIt's a seaman's knitted jumper (also called a guernsey) as it originated in the Channel Islands centuries ago. The fishermen needed warm jumpers which would resist sea spray and rain so they used wool with a tight twist and were knitted on small needles to give a tight tension. The chap in the photo above is wearing one but it's not part of a prisoner's uniform! He was a fisherman who was arrested in North Shields for stealing some money from a bar in a pub in 1904. No he wasn't sent to the colonies, he was fined 10 shillings!The use of the ganseys gradually moved north and into Scotland and as they did so the patterns which were originally plain gradually became more complicated. They were traditionally knitted by the wives and daughters and patterns were designed for specific villages. Some families had their own designs which enabled them to identify a fisherman in a case of drowning.So what's this got to do with this post? Well in 2016 the Tall Ships arrived in Blyth, Northumberland on Friday as part of the 60th North Sea Regatta and I posted about it here.In January 2019 a crew is due to set sail from Blyth, Northumberland to recreate the journey of a local man William Smith, who discovered Antarctica in 1819 but was never credited.Some keen knitters from Blyth, Astrid Adams & Janice Snowball successfully applied to Northumberland County Council's Community Chest fund for funding to knit ganseys for all the crew on that trip. They were successful, However their research showed that although other areas in Northumberland had gansey patterns Blyth didn't have its own pattern so they set out to design one incorporating the Tall Ships logo, waves, rigging ladders, anchors & the Northumberland flag. They put out a request for knitters to produce the ganseys. The knitters will receive a kit which includes the special gansey wool, needles and the Blyth pattern. The ganseys take approx 150 to 200 hours to knit but there is plenty of time as the voyage doesn't start until January 2019. There is also a hat pattern for those who maybe don't get accepted to knit the gansey or feel that a gansey is too much of a commitment.Each gansey will have a label with the knitter's name on it and the crew member who receives the gansey will be encouraged to write to the knitter. I've always wanted to knit a gansey as my Dad & brother were part time fishermen but the wool is very expensive & I mean expensive! So I applied about a month ago & apparently the project managers were inundated from applicants from across the globe. I didn't hold out much hope of being selected but today I got the invitation to be a gansey knitter! So I'll be looking forward to receiving my kit in the very near future and I can't wait to start even though I have a trillion balls of wool stashed away all over the house. Hopefully I will get around to knitting another later for my brother!You can see the details of the project and pattern photo on the County Council website here. I wasn't sure about the copyright so I didn't copy the photo.Before anyone asks, no the bloke on the Blyth gansey photo on the Council website doesn't come with the kit!"},
{"title": "Knitting for Neo Natal Units", "date": "Saturday 18 March 2017", "text": "The photograph above is one I took at the knitting group I joined where we knit items for various charities. As well as knitting hats & scarves for the Apostleship of the Sea and Seamen's Mission, Alzheimer's groups, orphanages in Zambia & India, we also knit for the neo natal units in the North East of England.The clothes in the photograph were ones that a guest speaker brought to show us what they need. We had been knitting patterns from the Internet & weren't sure if they were appropriate. I was knitting very small stuff but I noticed that other things being made that I thought would fit babies who were not premature.It was really difficult listening to some of the information relating to the items she brought. They collect wedding dresses that people have very kindly donated. How many people keep their wedding dress in the cupboard until it's ancient! They have seamstresses who remove all the trimming & then take the gown apart and make beautiful burial gowns for the babies. You can see one on the right hand side of the photo. There were also little pockets and cribs made from ice cream cartons for the really tiny ones as well as a range of clothes for the babies so they can have clothes to wear right up until they leave the unit. We were supplied with a good range of patterns for all the garments so we can vary what we knit & in a range of sizes.We have a great laugh whilst we're knitting & there's no bitching, well apart from about politicians as there's no dearth of ammunition in that quarter from home and across the globe! This is a set I made a couple of weeks ago, but you can't really see how small it was. I should have put something next to it to show its size in relation to the knitting. Sorry about the picture quality, it's off the phone as I had forgotten to take it in daylight. I was taking it to the meeting and couldn't find the camera. I couldn't resist adding the bows!This is a batch of hats, mitts & bootees. They don't take long to knit so you don't get tempted to put them away!This is the latest set, minus the buttons for the moment. The church pays about £7000 for a container which they will pack with all kinds of things to go to Zambia at Easter.    ﻿ Again apologies for the picture quality. I must get back to taking photos with a proper camera as I think the phone must be going ga ga. It has shut down a few times recently for no apparent reason & I've had a job resuscitating it. When I have, it's lost the plot with date & time. They're great when they work but awful when they don't. Maybe it's a warning I need to get a new one. It's a shame because I've liked this Windows phone & only had it for 3 years. Well that's usually 2 years longer than my children keep their iphones but we're not on the same planet when it comes to spending dosh on phones! I can't believe people spend £30-40 a month on a phone! There again I'm a child who grew up in the period just after the war when money was tight so I have a totally different approach to money!"},
{"title": "I Thought I had A Nasty Virus!", "date": "Wednesday 22 February 2017", "text": "I got a shock when I was looking at a sewing and crochet blog tonight that had some really useful information on it when suddenly a big white screen popped up backed by the Microsoft or rather A Microsoft page. An American voice told me my computer was infected and I had to ring them to get help to get rid of the virus. I had to do this immediately as my credit card details, personal information, Facebook Login etc was being sent to the scammers.Well at first I thought this is a scam and tried to shut the browser down but I couldn't close the page. So I shut down the tablet and rebooted, only to find the same page was back. This made me a bit worried and I almost went into panic mode but then my brain went into gear. (Well what passes for my brain nowadays). I don't have any programs, it's a tablet so they couldn't have installed a virus or malware. Also if it was really Microsoft they would know it was a UK registered tablet so no point in giving a US Toll Free number! Yes scammers at work here. So how to get rid of this problem as I'm no techie &  couldn't remove a programme as there aren't any. Luckily my husband has an old laptop so I looked up some information.It was really just a pop up window on the browser so all I had to do was press control Alt & Delete to bring up the Task Manager, locate Internet Explorer  & then End Programme.Simples!!! I'll be avoiding those really nice Craft Blogs now as it was obviously an ad which must have popped up as the mouse moved over the page. They do tend to have loads of them. On the plus side it will probably save me a lot of time, I can rummage around for ages looking at nice patterns & craft ideas.There really are some nasty folks out there trying to scam you and it is a shock when that message and the voice start and you can't get rid of the blooming thing. Key is not to panic."},
{"title": "Google Doodle!", "date": "Saturday 18 February 2017", "text": "Have to say I don't often like Google's doodles. Half the time I don't know the people they're commemorating or the event and the other half I don't like the doodle. I suppose they're trying to cover people and events globally so if I took the time to look into them it would be very educational. Nowadays I'm trying to clutter my brain up with remembering only the essentials. Just wish you could defrag your brain like you can with a computer!I haven't been posting much recently as I don't have a computer that's any use for blogging. I'm stuck with a tablet at the moment which is more difficult to use. However I found a draft of a post about this doodle when I was checking the Blog. I saw this one before Christmas liked it but didn't finish my post about it. It's commemorating the 105th anniversary of Roald Amundsen's successful expedition to reach the South Pole. After that the base served as short respite for the crew of Captain Scott’s expedition to the South Pole – a journey that they would sadly all die on during their return. It's a very clever doodle with its igloo shape but for me it looks like a snow globe. Maybe they meant it to! Why not take a look."},

On last summer's Scottish tour in May we were meant to visit the Cairngorm Mountains but our trip up on the mountain railway was cancelled. Our Aviemore driver suggested he take us to the Glenmore Visitor Centre as there was a forest for walks, a beach, reindeer centre & a decent cafe in case the weather changed. I had never been to this lovely place and to be honest although I did enjoy my previous year's trip up the mountain railway even though we needed ski jackets, woolly hats & gloves at the top. This was a different & lovely experience being on a beach in Scotland surrounded by the Cairngorm Mountains.The weather helped too as it was a very pleasant sunny day. Lovely!"},
{"title": "Never thought I'd like a frock with viscose!!", "date": "Thursday 12 January 2017", "text": "Have to say I have wondered for years why on earth so many clothes have been made in heavy cotton and linen which take an age to dry, are a nightmare to iron and crease so badly when you wear it. Cotton and linen are comfortable to wear in hot countries but can be such heavy fabrics when you go on holiday with the flight weight restrictions. My daughter doesn't understand why creases really naff me off but I'm pretty sure it's because I'm a child of the 'sixties when we wore clothes in fabrics that didn't crease much. Well I did! I used to make a lot of my own clothes. Shift dresses were in fashion which were a doddle to make, took very little fabric (think mini) and the fabrics were so easy to care for. I always avoided what I called the \"dreaded viscose\", that was a horrible material which creased badly and I still avoid it today! The fabrics I often used were usually made of the wonder fabric \"Crimplene\"! If you don't know about Crimplene it was quite a thick polyester fabric made by ICI, easy to sew, was reasonably cheap, came in brilliant colours and textures, hardly ever creased, was comfortable as it stretched as you moved, never lost its shape, you could drip dry it and it was absolutely brilliant to take on holiday.It went out of fashion as the lighter weight polyesters like Trevira came in and then gradually polyester cotton became fashionable and finally pure cotton took over.Now that the price of cotton has rocketed polyester fabrics have certainly made a comeback. I noticed last year that it was very difficult to buy fine cotton or even polyester cotton blouses everything seemed to be produced with man made fabrics.I used to love wearing dresses when I was young but as I put on more weight I've lived in skirts, trousers and tops. In a dress I looked like a sack of potatoes tied in the middle. However since I lost weight last year I thought I'd try to buy a couple of dresses as they are more fashionable now. Every single one that I've tried on recently has been produced with man made fibres, mostly polyester but some have been awful, thin and with fabric that creased badly. They've also been unlined and really expensive.However I ordered one in an online sale which was polyester and the dreaded viscose but it also had elastane in it and the reviews were so good I thought I'd risk it.  I love the fabric, gorgeous feel to it and not a crease in sight when I opened the tiny bag it had been posted in. It's so comfortable and so dressy. I know it will be brilliant to take on holiday as I'll be able to take it out of a case and put it straight on with no creases. It will wash, drip dry and not need ironing. Fabulous!!!!! Unfortunately no use for a hot climate but OK if there is air conditioning.The only trouble is I keep wondering whether I look like a 'sixties throwback in it. Sadly that photo isn't me & I don't delude myself that I look anything like that in the frock."},
{"title": "I Went to Mass in a Mosque!", "date": "Thursday 29 December 2016", "text": "I've been away for over 5 weeks visiting Singapore, Australia & New Zealand so am trying to catch up with blogging as I have had very little access to Wi fi.In October I was in Andalucía taking a tour to Antequera, Seville, Córdoba and Granada. I hadn't visited any of these places apart from a brief trip to the Alhambra in Granada about twenty years ago so was looking forward to new sights. When you're working trying to keep an eye on passenger making sure they don't slip behind & get lost, it's hard to take enough notice of your surroundings. You also can't hear everything the guide says & take decent photos so it's yet another place I need to visit again.Our trip to Córdoba was on a Sunday so it was quite busy and it was also very hot. We had a guided tour of the Jewish quarter of Córdoba which was very interesting. Quaint little streets & not so crowded as a lot of the old towns you visit.There are no Jews left in Córdoba now which is sad but the old synagogue has been beautifully restored & it is a lovely little place.Córdoba was founded by the Romans between 169 and 152BC and during the period of the Roman Empire, Cordoba was one its most important capitals. Seneca the famous Roman stoic philosopher, statesman, orator and poet was born here. The Roman Empire began to decline in the 4th Century and in 711 the Muslims arrived and the city became part of the province of the Domasco Caliphate.Muhammad Al-Ghafiqi was a renowned Muslim eye surgeon in the 12th century would you believe. He performed cataract surgery all those years ago, successfully!!!!On 29 June the keys of the city were handed over to Ferdinand 111, the Castillian king and so began the Christian era of Córdoba.Even though it was late in the season the place was fairly crowded probably due to the unusually warm weather for early October and as I said it was a Sunday.I loved the entrance to this restaurant.This was a quieter cafe.This is the Street of Flowers because it's normally full of gorgeous geraniums  but the flowers had all died off in the hanging baskets sadly.This house in the little plaza the street led to still had some lovely bougainvillea in flower.The Mosque of Cordoba known as the Mezquita, was begun in 785 and according to Islamic tradition it is made up of three parts: the Minaret or Tower, the Saha or Patio of Ablutions and the Praying Room.It remained in use until 1236 when the city was reconquered and in 1239 it became the Cathedral of the city. Sadly some of the original part of the Mosque was destroyed but thankfully much of it remains and the Mezquita is unique in being a Mosque Cathedral. In fact it is the only mosque kept in Spain and is one of the biggest in the world. It is around 22,400 sq metres, 175 north to south and 128 metres east to west.The following are photos of the courtyard or patio to the Mezquita which was surprisingly cool despite the strong sunshine and the heat outside in the streets. Those architects knew a thing or two about design!In the photograph below in the courtyard you can see the channels running from the circles where the orange trees are planted. There would have been water running down these channels which would have been extracted from a well now missing. These would have been the places that the Muslims performed their purifications. The BelltowerThe photographs below are of the roofed galleries surrounding the courtyard.As it was Sunday the interior of the Mezquita was closed to tourist visitors for the Masses to take place inside in the cathedral. I went to Mass and afterwards you are not supposed to use cameras on the way out. However I saw quite a few people taking photos so I grabbed my phone and clicked as I walked so they are not brilliant.As the mosque was closed to the public it wasn't lit and I didn't have time to get out the camera so the photographs are poor and are limited to the mosque not the cathedral. Apologies! Next time I visit I'll go when it's open to the public and you are allowed to take photos then.These columns and arches were built in the 10th Century and are just the ones you pass on the way to the cathedral. There was so much I didn't get to see so I have to go back!It's an amazing building just a pity I didn't manage to use my camera. I'll have to go back again (good excuse) to get better photos. Luckily there were no people around to block the view which will happen when it's open to the public.I didn't get a decent photo of the cathedral part after Mass sadly, I should have been a bit bolder and just got the camera out. It was lovely but a great contrast to the Mosque being of late Gothic design.Entrance to the Mezquita and cathedral from the courtyardView from outside the Mezquita looking into the courtyardOutside the Mosque the tourist photographers were out in force.This photograph is blurred because I was in such a rush to take it in case the police didn't want you taking photos of them. They were well armed but not in such great numbers as I saw in Paris. I suppose this is one place that could be at great risk being a cathedral inside a mosque.More views of the exterior of the Mosque. Next time I go back I'll make sure I visit when the Mezquita is open so I can get some better pictures.It's a lovely little city and I only saw a small part of it so I bought myself a book with beautiful photos. I don't usually do that nowadays as I have quite a few that I never look at. However I have been reading up on the city so I'll know what to look at when I go back."},

Although beautiful you realise how hard life must have been for those on board such vessels. Imagine having to climb up there! Everyone waiting for the fireworks.The ships left yesterday in glorious weather for the final race to Gothenburg and the local beaches were unusually packed to watch them sail away.  Looks like a good boat builder there! It's great that events like this come to the North East as they bring lots of visitors to the area which struggles economically. It was once a great ship building area﻿ where ships were built for the Royal & Merchant Navies until the Thatcher era in the 'eighties!   Next Tall Ships event is in 2018 when it will visit Sunderland. Just down the road so that will be great. Hard to believe but sixty years ago Sunderland was the largest shipbuilding town on the planet & it produced 25% of the UK shipping tonnage.

{"title": "Goodreads", "date": "Tuesday 16 August 2016", "text": "Anyone use Goodreads? I've used it for a while & found it useful for checking out books recommended, recording books I've read & listing ones I want to read.A few weeks ago I got an email from them telling me that a book I'd listed as wanting to read had a \"Giveaway\". Not having a clue about this I checked it out. Well I discovered that it was true they were giving away a book I has wanted to read but never got around to it. You didn't have any obligation to review the book if you won it. Although I have to say if they were good enough to give a book away surely I could spare the time to write a review.  So I entered the giveaway but realised I didn't have much of a chance as there were hundreds of others applying too.At that point I had a look at other books being given away & thought if the giveaway deadline was close & not many people were applying I'd enter. You could apply for any of them but I suppose I tend to limit my entries to increase my chances but if I see a book I really want I would just go for it. I apply even if I don't particularly think the book is one I would normally read. I have often read things people have given me that I wouldn't normally read & enjoyed them. Also the books can go into the charity shop after I've read them.Well I didn't win the first one but over the last three months I won four others so it was worth it. Can't believe how lucky I've been as I normally don't win anything but I suppose the more you enter the more you increase your chances.I wasn't too keen on the first book I won, it was a cold war spy story, A Quiet Life. The second one An Accident of Stars, a bit of a feminist out of world adventure was pretty good & the third & fourth, Conspiracy and The Optician's Wife, I'm saving for the long haul flight to Singapore in October and maybe on the cruise if I'm too tired on the plane.So if you haven't used Goodreads or entered the Giveaway why not try it? You just have to register & it won't cost you anything but a little bit of your time. No I'm not on commission! I just like to pass on information about freebies."},

It should eventually look a little bit like this:I did change the pattern slightly for the rose squares as they didn't turn out to be very square!This is the pattern Roses Remembered Blanket PatternThe blanket/throw is for her bedroom which I've been trying to paint this week. She's not a fan of blue, the room's current colour & my favourite. But if I want her to stay with us the colour has to change. I'm not a fan of pink, never have been so our compromise is an off white shade. I did agree to make the roses on the throw pink which was my compromise.I must admit that I can't paint for very long these days, old age has nothing to recommend it apart from a bus pass. I just do an hour or so & then have a coffee crochet a couple of squares then go back again for another hour or so. It's going to take a while. Never mind I've accepted that it's better to do a little & not have loads of aches & pains even though it drags it out.If I'm feeling adventurous I might try painting a couple of roses on the main wall & a bit of Parisienne writing to match the writing on the quilt & liven the walls up a bit.I let Lauren choose the quilt cover although I said no to the pug one she wanted, I really didn't want to see that every time I went into the room. So her Mam bought that as a spare for her room at home. Have to say I don't get the craze for pug stuff. Kittens yes, pugs no!Her second quilt choice was a Parsienne style one complete with Eiffel Tower which amazed me. I have no idea why she took a fancy to the Eiffel tower, she's never mentioned an interest in it or why she chose such a pale one, not what I would have thought an eleven year old would pick. Well not one who had originally wanted a pug quilt.                               No sadly that's not the bedroom but it is the quilt set. I love those white floorboards but in our house the upstairs floorboards are not nice enough to paint and they are a bit chilly in our climate, noisy too! So we'll just have to keep the carpet. Might have to buy a new one as the current blue may not be her choice either even though it's a lovely wool one! Still we could always refit it in the smaller bedroom which also need a makeover. Not this year though........."},
{"title": null, "date": "Monday 11 July 2016", "text": "Isola del GardaI've been missing from blogging as I've been on my travels again. Starting with the Inner Hebrides early May, Rhodes mid May & then Venice, Milan, Verona & Lake Garda in June. It's taken me ages to catch up with work & housework but hopefully things are getting back to normal. Well as near as it ever gets to normal in our house. I'm not the tidiest of people!The photo above is one I took on a boat as we were leaving one of the the islands in Lake Garda, Isola del Garda so that's why it's a bit skew whiff. I do love that house and it's wonderful Italian & English gardens. It's so peaceful there.The current house isn't that old really, but it's history goes a long way back. Cutting it short Gallic Roman tombstones were found on the island & around 1220 St Francis of Assisi built a simple hermitage there as he believed it was an ideal place for his monks. By 1797 Napoleon suppressed the monastery and later it became a state owned property.By 1860 it had been given to the army and then it was sold to private owners. I won't go into the detail but the villa was built in Neo Gothic Venetian style and is currently owned by the Cavazza family who live there. They open the house to the public and rent it for occasions such as weddings in order to restore and maintain it. My favourite bit is the terrace. This is where we ended up having some nibbles. There were bits of bread to dip in the olive oil produced from the family's olive groves, local cheeses, olives, water, orange juice and a glass of delicious white wine. Just imagine having your breakfast or any meal up here. This is the terrace (I think they called it the loggia) looking up from the ground level.The design is lovely.The ceiling is wonderful too. However the guide explained that it wasn't painted in situ, it was taken from a building and placed there!The views are fantastic.Unfortunately the day we were visiting was a little hazy for taking photos of the lake, it was really hot too but up on the terrace it was shady and a little cooler.These are some shots from the gardens. I had to keep on the move with the group and keep an eye on some elderly passengers so the photos were taken really quickly and are not the best! Sadly the tour came to an end so quickly and we returned by boat to Desenzano, our base for the week there."},

She was my favourite female comedy actor, writer, song writer, basically she was a comic genius. Luckily we'll be able to watch her amazing performances over & over.Hard to pick just one piece from her vast repertoire of TV comedy but I love this song. This isn't my favourite version I prefer the earlier ones which were longer but it's still great. What a lady.Thank you for the laughter!"},
{"title": "Dementia Awareness Week, 15 – 21 May", "date": "Monday 18 April 2016", "text": "My first Twiddlemuff!Dementia is something that scares us all whether it's the fear of developing it or coping with a family member who has this awful illness. You feel so helpless at times when you see a member of your family slipping away from you. This year 15 - 21 May is Dementia Awareness Week when The Alzheimer's Society will encourage people who are afraid of dementia to contact them for advice and support.Last week I joined a knitting group who meet at a local church to knit things for local charities. One of the things we are making is a Twiddlemuff.  They are designed to sooth restless hands & reduce agitation by providing stimulation for active hands,while promoting increased flexibility and brainstimulation.  So they are ideal for people with dementia or other mental health problems.You can find out more on the NHS website here and the pattern is there too. It's a very simple one and knits up quickly using up spare wool and other bits and bobs.The picture at the top is my first attempt.  Have to say it is quite addictive holding it, I used really soft wool for the interior and put satin ribbons inside and outside. I will be loathe to part with it next week so might just have to make one for myself!"},

{"title": "World Book Day!", "date": "Thursday 3 March 2016", "text": "Well just got back from dropping Lauren off at school today. They were letting the children dress up as a character from books. Have seen lots of princesses, Spidermen (& women) Darth Vaders, elves, knights etc. (Not all of these were characters from books methinks! There was one boy who was inside a cardboard box which was painted like a wall. It looked great but we couldn't think which book it was meant to be. Lauren suggested Humpty Dumpty more a nursery rhyme character but maybe it was a book we didn't know.We laughed as we were driving to school listening to the wireless, it was reported that an Umpa Lumpa had been seen on the M6. Probably caused a major traffic incident.Lauren was dressed up as Black Beauty. Well not exactly as the horse. She had her riding gear on hat, jumper, joddies & riding boots. She also had a crop which I warned to to be careful with! She was in one of those strange step into toy horses similar to the one below & it was brown not black. Reminded me of Bernie Clifton & that ostrich he used to have. She had wanted to go as Belle as she has a beautiful gold costume she got for going to Disneyworld about 18 months ago however she decided it was too cold to wear it. I think it's great that they encourage the children to focus on books & give them vouchers for books. It's hard to believe but some children just don't have any books in the house at all so the vouchers give them an opportunity to have one of their own. Also sometimes there's just too much emphasis on telly, films and computers which may stunt their imagination. As for me I'm ashamed to say I haven't read for a while, got out of the habit & into watching too much telly whilst I crochet. So last week whilst I was clearing out the little bedroom I found a bag of the Camilla Lackberg series of crime books which I had forgotten about. I decided to read them again. BIG mistake! It's a couple of years since I read them & I discovered she has written a couple more so I thought I'd go back to the beginning again. I really enjoy her style contrasting the normal lives of Patrick & Erica Hedstrom (police officer & writer) with the horrendous criminal characters form the past & present in that lovely little Swedish coastal town of Fjällbacka. I'd love to visit it sometime. I'm now up to the fourth book, The Stranger and I can't put the books down which means I'm getting very little work of any kind done & she keeps me guessing right to the end. What an imagination! I'll never get that bedroom cleared and decorated at this rate & I only have a few weeks left before I start the rail tours. Better read faster & for longer!!!!!!"},
{"title": "I'm Getting Hooked on the Telly!", "date": "Friday 19 February 2016", "text": "I can't believe it but after moaning so much about how terrible the telly has been for months it's great at the moment. My problem is my husband doesn't like the same programmes that I do so I have to wait until he's out to watch them on iPlayer. Thankfully they're all on the BBC so no problems there, we don't have anything to record programmes. When we had a video recorder I used to record programmes & never watch them!However I've been hooked for weeks now on a number of programmes, mainly BBC ones that I think are really good.War & PeaceI never thought I'd like it but I did. This is one my husband refused to watch! Not my favourite programme this winter but it's a very good production. The acting was brilliant, I enjoyed Lily James as Natasha, a bit more of a challenge than playing Cinderella. I'd never heard of Paul Dano who plays Pierre but he was good too although I can't say I admired or understood his character. James Norton was good as Prince Andrei but again I couldn't understand him, a bit of a misery and never satisfied. I kept wondering where I'd seen him before then realised he was the scary Tommy Lee Royce in the amazing Happy Valley series. The costumes were excellent especially those in the ballroom scene. The settings were sublime. My favourite scene was the ballroom one in Episode 3 where Natasha & Prince Andrei dance it was so romantic & beautifully filmed. One of those \"moments\" in film that are never forgotten.Don't think I'll read the book though it took me ages to figure out who everyone was in the first episode & apparently the book is confusing too. Wish I'd looked at the BBC website first where all the characters are listed. Also the war scenes were awful so I'll pass on this book. However Tolstoy's book has made the bestseller list for the first time ever. DickensianThis is another one I thought I wouldn't like but I'm totally addicted to it. Who would have imagined a mix of characters from a range of Dickens' books could meld into a murder & love story in 19th Century London. Excellent acting from a cast of great actors portraying such wonderful characters as Mr & Mrs Bumble, the gin swilling Mrs Gamp, Bob & Emily Cratchit, Bill Sikes & Nancy, Fagin & the Artful Dodger, Ebenezer Scrooge & Jacob Marley, Miss Havisham,  Little Nell, Fanny Biggetywitch & the wonderful central character Inspector Bucket. The make up & scenery are excellent, no Photoshopping here nor Disneyesque houses! We're up to episode 19 now & I think there's just one more to go. I'll be lost when it finishes so I hope Tony Jordan writes another series.Call the MidwifeI still enjoy this series about a group of midwifes in the early 'sixties working in the poverty stricken East End of London which has now reached series 5. Although I preferred the four earlier series it's still quite gripping seeing how life was back then with polio striking & the realisation of the effects of thalidomide. It's funny, desperately sad on occasions but a heart warming series based on the memoirs of the midwife Jennifer Worth who worked in the East End of London in the 'fifties. A Place to Call HomeI found this by accident one really cold afternoon when all I fancied doing was having a coffee & watching a bit of telly. I suppose it's a bit like an Aussie Dallas soap but much better. A drama set after World War two when an Australian nurse who had been a resistance fighter in France & a prisoner in a concentration camp travels back home to Australia on a cruise ship. She meets a well to do family returning home after visiting the UK & her life becomes entwined with theirs. At the centre of the family is an interfering snobby mother & grandmother whom you love to hate along with issues of racism, homophobia, sex outside of marriage (well it was the 'fifties) teenage pregnancy & so much more! I love the settings, Sydney & the wonderful houses & clothes.  Another one I've become addicted to & it's on every weekday afternoon! ShetlandI didn't watch the first series of this for some reason but saw the second one advertised so thought I'd watch it to see if I recognised any of the places I visited last summer. I recognised the North Link ferry & the road crossing at the airport runway but so far that's about all. Have to say it's a bit grey & reminded me of The Bridge the Danish/ Swedish crime series where it always seems to be cold & grim but I suppose it's the atmosphere they're trying to create. It's no Hawaii 5-0 that's for certain. It's also a bit harrowing rather like Happy Valley but I really want to see what happens.Happy ValleyI watched the first series of this last year & it really scared the wits out of me it was so harrowing. I watched the first episode of the second series and the characters are wonderful. I love the brilliant Sarah Lancashire who plays the gritty Yorkshire police sergeant. She is so funny & yet so desperately sad. I was hoping that the horrendous Tommy Lee Royce wouldn't be in it this time but I suppose he had to be but I won't give the game away about the plot. (Still can't believe it's the same bloke in War & Peace!) I'm not sure I want to watch Episode 2 but I think I'll give in.Father BrownThis is a good light hearted TV series based on the books by GK Chesterton about a crime solving Roman Catholic priest in the 'fifties. I remember the TV series in the 'seventies where Kenneth More played Father Brown & wondered how Mark Williams (Arthur Weasley in the Harry Potter films) would fare in the role. Have to say I think he's great. Quite droll & probably more realistic than Kenneth More was. After watching a number of these set in lovely English country villages it gets a bit like Midsummer Murders! There was never that number of murders in the whole of the country in those days. We still had hanging then!The Young MontalbanoAnother series I enjoyed watching but it's another programme I have to watch on iPlayer when my husband is out.  He won't watch anything with subtitles! Think this second series has grown on me. I kept comparing the first series to the Inspector Montalbano ones, although the Sicilian settings are the same they don't seem to have the same beautiful photography that Inspector Montalbano had. He doesn't swim as much in this series but I've got used to Salvo being younger & with a mop of curly hair!"},
{"title": "Italian Riviera", "date": "Sunday 10 January 2016", "text": "Happy New Year to everyone.I'm way behind on Blogging, this tour I took was late September/early October last year. Apologies!The journey to northern Italy was a long one. I travelled down to London the previous day then Sunday we caught the early morning Eurostar to Paris. I was surprised at how quiet Paris was trafficwise as we crossed from Gare du Nord to Gare de Lyon. Then we saw a sign indicating it was a car free Sunday in Paris. What a difference it made. Next we caught the TGV high speed train to Turin. We spent the night in Turin and I hadn't expected it to be such a lovely city. Beautiful squares, buildings, churches, museums and lovely shops.I won't describe them all or it will go on forever and this is really just a taste of the tour.The next few were taken in the Piazza San Carlo.This photograph is of the Palazzo Madama it was built on the site of gates of the Roman walls at the beginning of the 1st century BC! It houses a large collection of paintings, statues, church ornaments, porcelain, and decorative art, mostly from the late Middle Ages to the 18th Century.This was one of the staircases to the upper floors, it was so beautiful.I didn't have much time so I just browsed around on the ground floor where you can see through the glass floor to the Roman foundations. Sorry the photographs are not too clear but I'm just a point & click photographer & the light kept reflecting. It was incredible & so cleverly done.The photo above was taken in a street of really classy shops on the way up to the Palazzo. This is just one side of the street the road ran up the centre and there was another line of shops on the other side. However I was more amazed by the beautiful pavements than anything in the expensive shops! There are lots of Roman remains here in Turin. The one below is the Palatine Gate and Towers.Virtually everyone would have loved to stay here longer. Me particularly because the cathedral where the Turin Shroud is housed was closed at 1pm! Ah well a good excuse to go again. The real Shroud was on display earlier this summer, it's not displayed very often nowadays. So I only missed the copy!Next on to Milan where we changed trains & then on to our base in Sestri Levante a small town in Liguria on the east coast south of Genoa. I loved it. It isn't a beautiful place but it was certainly attractive with a beach on two sides & lots of interesting old buildings, very nice shops, restaurants & cafes. A place I certainly would go back to again, but only if I was on holiday!                      The town has two beaches, the photo above was taken at the beach of Baia del Silenzio on one good, late afternoon! Probably the only one we had in Sestri Levante.We stayed in a really lovely old villa, the 17th Century Villa Balbi which has been converted into a hotel. It retains a lot of the original features but has been modernised to make a really comfortable place to stay.                               The pool was lovely but freeeeeezing! That's why there was nobody in it. A couple of did try but I had a headache when I got out it was so cold.The hotel had its own beach just across the road but most of the time we spent here the weather wasn't really good enough to use it. Typical, Italy in September & they were having far better weather.This is the beach in front of the hotel. Shame we never got to use it. We visited three of the little Cinque Terre, Five Lands, towns one day, Vernazza, Riomaggiore & Manarola. My photographs are not named as they have all burred together now. I should have spent time naming the photographs but I didn't even have time to download them before we went on holiday soon afterwards. However you can get the feel of the places from the pictures. They are very old, with beautiful churches, located on the coast west of La Spezia but very overcrowded with tourists even at the end of the season early October.      Getting 34 people of various ages & levels of mobility on & off the trains was a nightmare for me. I spent a lot of time wandering up & down the train reminding people that the Italian trains only stop for a couple of minutes & they had to be ready to get off quickly. It worked until the day we went to La Spezia when one old lady just ignored what I said & was left on the train. Not only that she had stopped other people on the tour from getting off. Her son who was supposed to be looking after her was totally unaware & was blithely chatting to other people. Luckily I had the mobile number of one of them so could advise them what to do.I did like La Spezia despite the stress, probably because it wasn't as crowded as the other places we visited. I'll leave it here for now. There's still Pisa, San Fruttuoso & Portofino left!"},
{"title": "Shetland", "date": "Monday 26 October 2015", "text": "The Shetland Islands lie 600 miles north of London and are only about 200 miles from the coast of Norway. They are as far North as St Petersburg in Russia & Anchorage in Alaska. There are over a hundred islands but only about 15 are inhabited. The largest of these is the Mainland & Lerwick is the main centre with ferry & airport connections. What I hadn't realised was that the Shetland & Orkney islands were part of Norway until the 15th Century. So we set sail for Shetland in early September but sadly our day on Shetland didn't bring good weather. It was overcast but the rain held off for a couple of hours. Our first stop was for photos of the lovely Rerwick Beach. The beaches on Shetland are amazing & there are lots of them! Such beautiful sand, gorgeous shades of blue & turquoise that had nothing to do with the reflection of the sky, you can watch seals swimming and they're deserted. You can just see on in the first photo but there were lots of them just cruising around.Next stop was an amazing archaeological site of Jarlshoff.  There are Bronze Age houses, Iron Age broch & wheelhouses, Viking long houses, farmstead & a 16th Century laird's house.This is the laird Patrick Stuart's house and what a view he must have had from his bedroom windows. The photograph before this one shows what a magnificent beach it overlooks.It was amazing to see all these settlements built on top of each other from the different ages. What really surprised me is how people can just tramp around them. Not sure how much damage is done by tourists. I tried to make sure I kept to the grass even though it was slippy.Unfortunately by this time it was raining heavily & it was really cold. So off we go to our next stop via the airport. Here we are on the bus waiting for the lights to change to let us cross the runway after a plane had landed! Next stop was to see the Shetland ponies. My daughter Claire asked me to make sure I took photos of the Shetland ponies! Unfortunately the rain didn't make them too interested in posing for our cameras bless them.They looked really miserable with their backs to the wind & rain. However their owner assured us they don't like being indoors, it drives them mad. There are very few trees on Shetland & no hedges for shelter so they turn their bums to the wind & rain! The cows & sheep were exactly the same & it looked really funny as we don't see that in most places at home. Normally there's lots of trees or hedges for them to find shelter. For lunch we headed into Lerwick & by then it was absolutely tipping down. With another knitting fan I opted out of lunch and headed for the Shetland wool shop Jamiesons! It was fantastic, all the colours of the rainbow & more, in all the types of wool. I found a lovely shawl pattern & had great difficulty choosing the colour from such a wonderful range.No that's not me sadly!I decided on a gorgeous shade of blue as usual, Azure. I've finished it but it's been blocked & is drying out in the conservatory at the moment so when I get back from holiday I'll take a photo of it.I also bought a Shade card, quite expensive at £8 but I knew I would want to buy more wool later. The lady in the shop told me it was more expensive to buy the wool elsewhere & she was right, it certainly is. Might have to make a trip back to the shop next year. Meanwhile I'll just have to drool over the shade card, it was a very good buy!Our next stop was the Scalloway Museum where there is a lot of very interesting information. I hadn't come across the story of the Shetland Bus before & it was really moving. The Shetland Bus was a Shetland based special boat operation that took place during World War 11. In 1940 the German forces occupied Norway which led to a stream of refugees heading west. Most of these landed in Shetland. Many successful missions were carried out using the small fishing cutters that had brought the Norwegian refugees to Shetland. They landed agents, radio sets & ammunition & returned with refugees.Model of the M/K Arthur, one of the boats used in the Shetland Bus Operation.Most of the boats used were only between 50 & 70 ft long but they were operating in some of the roughest seas in the world in winter to cover the 200 miles east from Shetland to Norway. Many lives were lost in heavy seas or enemy action and the operation was due to be cancelled but the US Navy provided 3 fast sub chasers. They were well armed & fast & from November 1943 they carried on the same kind of operations that the fishing boats had done and without no further loss of life. If you want to find out more about the operation the Scalloway Museum has a good website, The Shetland Bus. We also visited the Shetland Museum & a really lovely silver jewellery design company which I haven't recorded.Have to say I was surprised at how much there was to see on Shetland never mind the wool! Lovely scenery & beaches, great museums to research the history & culture of the islands, brilliant arts & crafts and lots of sporting activities. Far too much to see in one day! Need to go back again."},

Another place I need to come back to!Such beautiful old buidings and I'm on the look out for Juliet's balcony. This isn't it!Nor this.More balconies!And another!Lovely squares or rather piazzasNo still not Juliet's!No still not the right balcony.Nice balconies but still not there yet.Yes, Finally, this is it! Don't think this is original. Think it's had some work done on it. Had to wait ages for the people to get off the balcony. Think they pay to go in & then they take selfies. Sad!Now this is just weird. People go & touch one of the boobs on Juliet's statue for luck in love. Someone should tell them that the original statue was removed due to being damaged by continual tourist touching & this is just a copy. More, saddoes!Here we are near the Arena where they hold the operas. Note the scenery stored outside.and some of the characters!The Arena is a gorgeous setting for operas. Wish I had been able to go to one. Didn't even have time to go into it.There are some gorgeous buildings in Verona & the area surrounding the Arena it is very pretty.Very nice place to sit & relax if you have the time."},
{"title": "It's a Struggle!", "date": "Monday 24 August 2015", "text": "Language learning that is. I've always found it difficult. Didn't start learning another language until I was 11 when I went to grammar school & then we were taught Spanish & Latin. Didn't find either very easy but I think it was down to the way they taught you. I still think we should start teaching children foreign languages in primary school but of course we don't have the teachers to do that. I also think it was a big mistake when they stopped making a foreign language a compulsory subject for GCSE.I went to Spain when I was 18 to spend a couple of weeks with my pen friend & her family & I had to listen carefully as the family all spoke Spanish continuously with the odd English translation now & again as only my pen friend spoke any English. I did find that listening to it constantly started to make me think in Spanish which felt weird.It did encourage me to keep going trying to learn Spanish which I've done on & off for the last 50 years but I still haven't mastered it. Main reason is I find other things to do so it's been more off than on. My accent isn't too bad but I think you have to live in a country to become reasonably fluent. I have no chance of that now!In March I discovered I had to do two Italian tours this summer, I never get Spanish ones where I could have some practice! So I thought I'd have a go at learning a little bit of Italian. I bought some CDs, a dictionary & found a couple of websites. The CDs are by Michel Thomas & they are quite good, I keep them in the car & play them repeatedly. I still haven't got past lesson 10 as it's quite difficult when it's just spoken & you can't see the words. This is where the websites come in useful. They are very good as they make you type answers in Italian as well as English and they have the phrases spoken in Italian for you. They seem to recognise where you make mistakes & keep repeating those bits for you. I did borrow an Italian grammar book from the library as I like to check things out. Another resource I used was Coffee Break Italian which has 15 minute weekly podcasts available on the radiolingua.com website. You can download them free or find them on iTunes.Have to say I've found it quite difficult. I'm sure it's because of being older. I find I just can't memorise the words easily. I have to keep going over them again & again. However I'm not giving up!I did try using a few expressions when I was in Desenzano, always said buongiorno, buonasera, grazie etc & asked for my room number in Italian. It was wasted really as they spoke such good English but I like to try. I've been trying to do a couple of sessions every day picking up some new words & going back doing some revisions. Have to say I'm really enjoying it which is a surprise. I just hope I can keep up with the sessions, I'm no linguist I know but at least I try.Hopefully I'll be a bit more confident at speaking a little more when I get to the Italian Riviera at the end of September.If anyone is interested the two websites I've been using are:Www.duolingo.comWww.memrise.com They have a range of languages to choose from and they're free! There are premium versions of the sites but you don't have to buy into them. Buona Fortuna!"},
{"title": "Venezia!", "date": "Thursday 20 August 2015", "text": "We got the train from Desenzano & arrived in Venice to be greeted with this view of the Grand Canal as we stepped out of the station. Unfortunately there was no time for more photos as we had to make our way quickly to the boat pick up point. The hired boats can't hang around for long on the Grand Canal. We made our way via the Giudecca Canal around the working industrial part of Venice. It's a very busy route with lots of boats passing by. Here's the Azamara Journey which was docked in this area.As we headed out of the industrial part of the port towards the city we passed some quite attractive buildings.I'm not sure why my photos look so dull. I thought the camera was set to take scenery photographs but the button is quite loose now so maybe it had moved. I was quite disappointed with the pictures as the light doesn't seem very good & were not very well focused. I didn't realise it but I snapped the Bridge of Sighs by accident in the photo above. It's the bridge between the two buildings on the left, not the lower one, the little one above it.  The island of San Giorgio taken from our boat which was whizzing along! Surprised it came out at all. View from the Cornelli Pier where we picked up our tour guide.The guide took us along some back streets & piazzas we would never have chosen but the history was interesting. She told us about the fresh water wells & how you can fill your water bottles from the fountains in Venice. The water is very pure & it's free! So if you're visiting don't waste your dosh on buying bottled water, use the street water fountains!As I said we wouldn't have chosen the streets she took us along but they were interesting & you can see people filling their water bottles here.As you wander around you pass lots of little canals & over numerous bridges.The guide took us to this church which she said was the only Greek Orthodox one in Venice. Inside there was a bit of a telling off from someone who wasn't happy about us visiting without booking!Not sure why it was a problem as there was nobody else there & no service going on. My photo isn't cock eyed apparently the tower isn't straight!Off we go again now on our way to St Mark's Basilica via more little streets & canals. I love places where you just don't know what's around the corner.The Bridge of Sighs, really more like a little corridor than a bridge.Not the best of photos but the bridge we were standing on to take the photo was really crowded so I was lucky to get a photo at all.It was built in 1600 and connects the New Prison to the interrogation rooms in the Doge's Palace. The guide told us the \"story\" of how it got its name. Apparently the view from the Bridge of Sighs was the last view of Venice that convicts saw before their imprisonment. The name comes from the suggestion that prisoners would sigh at their final view of beautiful Venice through the window before being taken down to their cells. In reality, the days of inquisitions and summary executions were over by the time the bridge was built and the cells under the palace roof were occupied mostly by small-time criminals. Also they couldn't see much from inside the Bridge due to the stone grills covering the windows. Still it's a romantic story.    Here we are back out facing the Grand Canal. I know it wasn't brilliant sunshine but I'm sure it wasn't this dull! Apologies! I love taking photos of people taking photos! I was amazed at how many people were taking selfies. The street sellers were obviously making a bomb from selling the selfie sticks.Some shots of the Doges Palace   I loved the two columns in St Mark's Square. This one had the Lion of Venice on top.   St Mark's Campanile Apparently the Bell Tower fell down in 1902 but it was rebuilt as it had been complete with the Angel Gabriel on top which I never saw!﻿ St Mark's Square Clocktower I had never noticed this on my previous visit, neither had quite a few others on our tour, until the guide pointed it out.St Mark's Square wasn't very crowded compared to the last time I was there. Napoleon called it the most beautiful reception room in all Europe. Well he obviously saw it without all the tourist groups & the tourist tat for sale! He also didn't pay the extortionate price for a cup of coffee & neither did I!St Mark's Basilica FaçadeThere is the usual scaffolding which seems to accompany these beautiful buildings but I suppose it's necessary to keep them safe for future generations to enjoy.St Mark's in all its gory with the scaffolding. Last time I was there the scaffolding was over the main entrance.We did get inside without having to wait in the horrendous queues as we were with a guide. However it was a very quick walk through as due to the large number of visitors you only get to see a small part of it. It took barely 5 minutes which was disappointing. The style is Byzantine but it seemed quite dingy, there are few windows & it wasn't not well lit the day we were there. Considering this is one of the most visited churches in the world I can't say I was particularly impressed. However I found a website for the Basilica which has a 3D version here & also views of areas which are excluded from tours. If you click on the various views at the top of the page the outline shows & then if you click on the box with the arrow you can see the various sections of the Basilica. Quite clever and it looks much nicer than when we were there.You are not supposed to take photographs inside & I always follow the rules so I have no pictures. A lot didn't despite the very obvious warning signs but nobody stopped them. The tour ended at the Basilica & we went our various ways to sightsee & get some refreshments before we met up at the railway station for the return journey. I decided I would just wander through the side streets towards the Rialto Bridge & look for somewhere to eat.  Another lovely bridge. I hope that family haggled & got a decent price for their gondola trip! ﻿ Enjoying a refreshing break! Venice is famous for its masks & carnivals & there was certainly no shortage of shops selling them.  I was sorely tempted to buy one for my granddaughters but the thought of having to carry it back safely by train via Milan, Basle, Strasbourg, Paris & London put me off.The ubiquitous M."},
{"title": "Sirmione", "date": "Wednesday 19 August 2015", "text": "Sirmione We left Desenzano by boat to go to the peninsula of Sirmione on another scorcher of a day. The air was lovely on the lake but once at Sirmione the heat hit us. So we made for the beach!Unfortunately there was a triathlon taking place so the beach was taken up with swimmers & the noise of the woman commentating was unbelievable so I fairly quickly left. Luckily it's a small peninsular so you can cross to the other side in a few minutes & get some peace.I had a walk up one of the side streets to the church where I caught a Mass.                          Afterwards I wandered further up the peninsula and you can see the Dolomites in the distance.Then down toward the beach again.As I walked down towards the town I saw this. When I read the plaque on the wall I saw it had been where Maria Callas had lived. Maria Callas' Villa Maria Callas spent her summers here from 1952 to 1959, until she met Aristotle Onassis!Mind you I'd rather stay here given the chance. Problem is the gates are locked so I couldn't get in to take photos of the actual hotel but it looked gorgeous. Villa Cortine PalaceOn the road down into the town there were lovely trees in blossomLovely traditional shops & cobbled streetsColourful gardens All too soon we were heading back to Desenzano﻿!However it was a great speedboat ride back which most of us enjoyed, but not all!Next stop Venezia!"},
{"title": "I've Been Knitting & Crocheting Like Mad!", "date": "Sunday 16 August 2015", "text": "Once I retired I started to knit again. I managed to keep my wool buying to a minimum for a while but I got really hooked on knitting lacey shawls. I have about five lots of wool waiting for shawls but I'll do those in winter. However I have bought quite a lot of wool in sales in recent months. I've done quite a lot over the last few weeks but I need to slow down with it but most of all the wool buying!  I thought I had got over the habit of starting new things & then leaving them but obviously I haven't.  I started to crochet the blanket above & I really like it. I changed the colours to blues, beige & cream as I just don't do pink. I'm making it in pure wool & I've got quite a lot done. Would have had it finished but it was too heavy & bulky to take on holiday so it's standing in the corner of the dining room. I'm not putting it away in case I forget about it! One of the 45 squares (I've done 35)I did manage to crochet a little summer bolero last week from some cotton that's been lying around for over a year now. The pattern below was very quick & easy to do. I made it in white & it's lovely. However it's quite heavy so may not make it into the case for the next holiday!  My next tour is to the Orkney & Shetland Islands in September. I'm not expecting warm weather in fact I assume it will be pretty windy, cool & possibly wet. I don't wear hats as I don't think I suit them probably because I wear glasses. However I know I really need one for that trip. On our last tour in the Hebrides it was very chilly & some ladies bought pom pom hats on the Isle of Mull. They were very nice but cost them nearly £30! So I decided to knit one a couple of weeks ago. I liked the one below.   The Baby Alpaca Silk  was lovely & soft to knit with, however after I finished it I decided the pom poms were a tad twee so I crocheted a flower. This is the finished product below.﻿ ﻿  I'll probably never wear it again after the tour but I don't want to have to spend a mint on buying one in Scotland.  I also made an Estonian shawl for a friend. It's the Triangular Summer Shawl from Nancy Bush's book Knitted Shawls of Estonia. I've made it four times now & I love the pattern despite all the nupps! She hasn't got it yet so hope she likes it.  I'm more than half way through making this jumper below in blue cotton but I've stopped. I know the reasons why I usually stop, either I'm not sure I like what it's looking like or I've altered the pattern! Yes, I've altered the pattern. However I need to keep going, I can't have more stuff lying about.  I also have the cotton for this back fastening jumper!!!!!!! Don't bother watching this space, I have no idea when I'll get it done as I've decided I want to make a quilt, not a huge one though!"},
{"title": "Desenzano, Lake Garda", "date": "Saturday 1 August 2015", "text": "The second stage of the journey eventually brought us to Desenzano after a long (7 hours) but absolutely wonderful train ride from Gare de Lyon, Paris to Milan & then a bus ride. Have to say I love this place!Interesting old buildings  Lovely rooftops & vistasPretty little harbour.A CastleWonderful views of Lake Garda ﻿Interesting little streets & shopsA lovely promenadeThe lavender shop on the seafront!Lavender everywhere!I thought I had taken lots of photos of Desenzano but I hadn't taken enough. No ice cream shops or restaurants, no ferry pictures & none of the churches. What was I thinking about! Well work problems really, I didn't have much free time & we're not supposed to take photos whilst we're working. Makes it seem too much like a holiday!One passenger who was travelling alone got lost & ended up having horrendous blisters on both his feet the like of which I've never seen before. Sorting him out meant trips to the chemist for plasters & painkillers, getting him food & drink for when we were away from the hotel on trips & keeping him company some of the time as he couldn't leave his room for a couple of days. I have no idea why I've never been to Lake Garda before. Maybe because it's not an easy place to get to from the North East. Most holidays & flights are to Rome or the Venetian Riviera. There's only one company with flights & you have to do the full holiday package with them. No direct flights to Venice or Verona & to get to there via train took me three days on the tour. You could probably do it in two but it's still quite expensive by the time you add on hotels.I loved everything about Desenzano, people had told me I would but I was surprised at how much I loved it. The people, the hotel, the food, the little streets & piazzas, the old buildings, the range of lovely shops (no tat & no chains in the older part), restaurants & ice cream shops, easy transport to other places via the lake or the train but best of all was the lake itself & the gorgeous scenery. This is one place I have to go back to. Hopefully next year & I won't be working, a real holiday next time.Our first trip from Desenzano was on the ferry to Sirmione. So that's the next post!"},
{"title": "Gay Paree!", "date": "Sunday 19 July 2015", "text": "It's over 20 years since I was in Paris but the first leg of my tour to Lake Garda took me to Paris for the afternoon & evening. We arrived on the Eurostar & then transferred to a hotel next to Gare de Lyon railway station. I've only seen the area around Gare du Nord which never seems to be particularly attractive with the unbelievable amounts of graffiti! I'd never been to that part of Paris & was really surprised at how attractive it was. Lots of restaurants & lovely older buildings. Wish I had taken more photographs.Just look at all those cycles. Amazing! And take a look at those motor bikes. All the outside area of the station was covered in them & the bikes. Shows how many people use the trains!I decided I would just go for a walk as I was on my own & didn't fancy eating alone. So I bought a baguette from the station, they do quite good food in all the railway stations. They even had a Costa! Then I went on my way wandering down to the riverside. It was a really warm & sticky night so I just drifted.I was amazed at how many people were down there along the banks, drinking & enjoying picnics. Not just students but whole families, right along the riverside on both banks.Salsa dancing too!What surprised me was how most of them seemed to have to sit right on the edge & the concrete when there were seats & grassy banks available. Shows my age! More dancers! These were doing a sort of tango.It was a lovely evening & I enjoyed the walk back to the hotel but was glad to get back to my air conditioned room. Normally I can't stand it & switch it off but it was unbearable without it.This was a lovely little street very close to the station where they were all sitting out eating & drinking.I was hoping to have a Costa coffee as a nightcap in the station but they had shut shop!Next stop, Desenzano, Lake Garda."},
{"title": "Staffa & Fingal's Cave", "date": "Friday 12 June 2015", "text": "Have to say I'm not quite sure where to start with a post. I've got so many photos but I think I'll go with Staffa & Fingal's Cave, Scotland. The photos are not as clear as I hoped mainly because of the wind, it was really hard to keep the camera steady & often I was hanging onto the rail with one hand to keep my balance.As you can see it was the usual Scottish weather, the water was a bit rough but not too bad, it was chilly & a bit grey but not too dreek!We had to take a small boat out from Ffionphort on the Isle of Mull to Staffa. I have seen photos of Staff & Fingal's Cave but I wasn't prepared for what I encountered. I thought you could just land & walk into the cave. No such luck!Here we are getting off the little boat onto the jetty.Looking up you can see there could be climbing involved!Now heights are not my style so I opted out of going up to see the puffins, much as I love them.It was amazing to see the thrift growing between those basalt columns with no soil & despite the sea water washing them.So ye tak the high road & I'll tak the low! I chose the low path to Fingal's Cave.Not quite as easy as I thought. It got higher & narrower. It was perishing cold & I wished I'd brought some gloves.I didn't dare take photos at the narrowest point. It was very windy & really cold so didn't want to lose my grip on the rail. It's getting wider & flatter here & the rail has disappeared......for now! That lulled me into a false sense of security.                     Here we are at the entrance to the cave & the rail is back thank goodness!﻿ Just look at the colour of the water it's gorgeous. I kept thinking of Mendelssohn's The Hebrides Overture when I was looking at the water rushing in & out.                                              Now I did wonder whether I should venture in any further but in for a penny in for a pound as they say.        but no safety rails here! I did wonder what would happen if anyone slipped & fell in. There were no lifebelts! It was a bit of a drop plus the water was gushing in & out of the cave.        Not sure whether you'd call this a roof or a ceiling because the columns reminded me of the structure of a cathedral. I think Gaudi would have been thoroughly at home here. Looking out of the cave you can see how narrow the ledge is & the drop.  I made it out!Everyone got back safely & thankfully the boat came back for us & the boat's dog. By this time I was wondering whether we were suffering from hypothermia!We considered ourselves very lucky to have been able to land there that day as the previous day the weather had been terrible. Here's the beautiful music of Mendelssohn that The Hebrides & especially Fingal's Cave inspired:"},

The golf club manager wouldn't speak to me, sent the young receptionist out to say \"Nothing to do with us. It's the golfer's fault\". \"OK then which golfer\"?\"Nothing to do with us\"!Which was absolute tosh. What about public liability insurance? They have to have it or their business is running illegally.So I went into the hotel where I was meeting a friend for a meal & asked to speak to the manager about their golf club manager. Have to say their staff there were lovely asking was I OK, could they get me a coffee etc. Manager apologised, the golf club is now privately owned. He went to speak to the department who deal with insurance & was told yes they are insured but not for golf ball damage! Well I don't believe that for a minute. However he offered on behalf of the hotel to pay the excess on the windscreen replacement.I wondered what would have happened if I had been walking up the drive & the ball had hit me. So a nasty shock, a ruined evening out & now the company doing the replacement say they can't change the windscreen for a week!Well I'll be writing a thank you letter to the hotel staff for their customer service, a not so nice letter to the Golf Club Manager & it's back on to the insurance company tomorrow to say their windscreen replacement service is unacceptable.As I said earlier \"I don't believe it\"!"},
{"title": "I Haven't Been Slacking - Honestly!", "date": "Monday 11 May 2015", "text": "AuroraWell I've had a bit of a break from blogging but I have been quite busy. Enjoying myself mostly, on a Panama Canal cruise!  Now I will post about that later as there are lots of photos to upload. Meanwhile above there's a photo of the ship Aurora which was very nice.  It's docked at Puntarenas which was not quite so nice!Anyway since I got back apart from the washing & ironing, I've been quite busy trying to finish a crochet blanket I started a couple of months ago.  If I'd had room in the luggage I would have taken it with me on the cruise but it was quite bulky & heavy. We only had 23 kg of luggage for a 23 night cruise which needed posh frocks (for me) plus a dinner jacket & a suite for Eric so I took a shawl pattern to do.  I knitted it for two weeks, didn't like it & pulled it out so I had nothing to show for my time spent knitting on the ship. My time wasn't totally wasted though.  I went to Spanish lessons which were great. I joined the ship at the end of March when the ship was doing its final leg of the world cruise it had started way back in January. So I only had three weeks to catch up with most of the other passengers who had started when the ship, left Southampton in January! Have to say I thoroughly enjoyed it & we had a great laugh with the young Spanish tutor who had a wonderful sense of humour. So now I really need to keep the Spanish up. I had planned to learn some Italian on the cruise for my two trips to Italy in the summer. That went by the board though like the knitting. So apart from trying to finish the blanket, that's on the cards for the next couple of months.Anyway this is my progress with the blanket so far:10 of these done!10 of these done!Now for the bad news. Only 5 each of these done because I've run out of wool! Never mind the flowery centres are finished so the easy peasy bits are left to do. Well apart from joining the whole caboodle together which I'm dreading.So will have to order more wool this week. Hopefully it will eventually look something like this.I changed the colours as I don't do pink & I made it in wool not cotton.I'm nearly always amazed at how good camera photos are. Bearing in mind I've never bothered to find out how to use it I just point it at the thing & click. It's great, no having to upload the camera photos, they just go. Just like magic!Wish it was as easy to learn Italian!"},
{"title": "What a Day!", "date": "Tuesday 24 March 2015", "text": "You get them don't you, those days when you just shouldn't have got out of bed!For once I got up early & made some soup before I went out to meet my sister for coffee & then lunch. Well then I couldn't find my purse. Had my handbag but not the purse. After a 20 minute panic & a search that got more desperate by the minute I finally found it on the window sill of all places.After lunch I left Marks & Spencer to get the car & as I approached it the car started to shudder. I realised someone had hit it. A car pulled in next to it & two elderly people got out, totally oblivious to the fact the lady had hit my car. Luckily they had only scraped some paint off, red paint! The old chap was vehemently denying they had touched the car & the lady said she didn't think she had touched it as there was no red paint on her silver car. I looked & the front of her car was covered with scrapes & mainly white paint.  Crumbs it was a mess. She said that had been done earlier when she hit her garage. There was red paint on it but there were so many bumps & scratches it was hard to see it. She offered to pay me for some paint but I felt really sorry for them so I said no, I would just get it done. The chap had some kind of brain problem. To be honest she probably shouldn't be driving. I will have to be more careful where I park in future, as far away from the shops as I can as the more elderly try to get as near to the shop as possible. Crumbs you would think I was a spring chicken!You would think that was my lot for the day, but no. Fate had some more rubbish to dump on me. After I had read with the children in Year 2 at My granddaughter's school, I walked out of the gates with her & promptly fell over. No I hadn't imbibed anything alcoholic with my lunch, I had fallen foul of a path with paving stones that had sunk to a lower lever than the concrete part of the path. Yes probably as a result of some service companies laying new cables or pipes! They have made a horrendous mess of our roads & pathways. Well it took me a few minutes to get my breath back & get up. I'd badly twisted my ankle, bashed the knee on my other leg & hurt my hands. Still I managed to get up & hobble to the car. It was a difficult job putting the clutch in though, hurt like mad. My ankle's badly swollen & I have a lovely lump on my knee which will be black & blue soon, but I don't think anything is broken thankfully. Mustn't have osteoporosis or I could have had a few broken bones with the way I fell down. So as soon as I can go back to the school I'll take a photo, contact the council to tell them to get their act together & get the path fixed before someone has an even nastier fall & takes them to court!I had intended to go shopping for stuff for our holidays afterwards but that went for a burton! Took my granddaughter home & promptly dropped my phone on the brick driveway! Luckily it just took a chunk out of it, the glass didn't break & the phone is still working. Thankfully it isn't an iPhone or it would have been a gonner. My daughter got a new one recently & within less than 24 hours the screen was broken. A bit femmer as my granddad would have said. Whereas I've dropped mine a few times & it's been OK. Must get a cover for it or one of these days it will break.So all in all not a good day, I kept thinking it must be Friday 13th! However I'm counting my blessings. It could have been a whole lot worse!Sadly I won't be shopping for new clothes tomorrow either, just not up to it. I'm staying at home. In fact I might not get out of bed but knowing my luck I'll probably fall out!Maybe I'll make some more Easter chicken baskets! A good excuse to get out of the housework. As if I needed one!Happy Easter to everyone in case I don't post again soon."},

The weather has been quite good so I haven't stayed in much. Done quite a bit of gadding about locally & taken a few photos so maybe I'll get to post some.I've done a lot of knitting, shawls mainly. Now three are waiting to be blocked if I ever find the time!Well I've got some of my rail tours for this year. Can't believe I've got two Scottish ones! I'm going to some of the places I went last summer & some brilliant new ones.I did love Ballachulish which is not far from Fort William. We travelled up from Glasgow on the West Highland Line. Keeping my fingers crossed nfor a fine trip. It pelted down the whole day so we could hardly see a thing on the journey. I was told it was a gorgeous trip, well I might get to see it this time.It was so serene & peaceful in Ballachulish. The photo above is of the old hotel we stayed in which was on the edge of Loch Leven. The photos below are of the Loch & you can see how lovely it was even in quite dull weather. Well it is Scotland.I had to laugh at what two Americans said to me complaining about the hotel. \"The company should never send people to hotels where there are no shops & restaurants\". I think they must have expected Disneyworld! Not sure how I held it in!Not sure if we'll be going here I haven't got the final itinerary yet. It was very photogenic & has been used for lots of films including Skyfall. It was hard getting a photo without anyone walking in front of you to take a photo! Eilan Donan CastleOff again to Isle of Mull on the ferry from Oban. I enjoyed that ferry crossing.Ferry to Isle of MullOn the Crossing to MullDidn't get to stay on Mull last time, only toured Duart Castle but I think we're staying in Craignure for three nights. Hope we get to Tobermory this time & see the lovely location for the children's TV series Balamory! Always wanted to go there but won't get to see Archie's pink castle!InvernessI'll get to Inverness again. I liked it but didn't have enough time to see much. Another dull day but at least it didn't rain.I'll get to go on the Jacobite Steam Train again alias Hogwart's Express! A lovely journey from Fort William to Mallaig especially great crossing the Glenfinnan Viaduct. Glenfinnan ViaductAny Harry Potter fans will remember this from the scene with the flying Ford Anglia! The photo isn't good because it was taken from inside the train & the windows were closed. There were people in cars following us & stopping every so often to wave to the train. Just hope the weather is a bit kinder this time.I'll be in the lovely Edinburgh a few times. The weather was gorgeous both times I was there!National GalleryPrinces Street GardensThis time I'll also get to Glasgow which I also love.Now the new places I'm going to are Aberdeen & right up to Thurso & John O'Groats at the top of Scotland to catch the ferry to Orkney & the Shetlands. We'll also be travelling on the Royal Deeside Railway & going to Balmoral if the Queen isn't in residence! WOW!I'm also going to Pitlochry, Plockton (where they filmed Hamish Macbeth) Urquhart Castle Loch Ness, the Hebrides, Staffa, Iona & Fingal's Cave. Double WOW!!!!!Here's a link to my map of the places I'm visiting in Scotland. See how far up north Shetland is from Thurso. It's a fair trek, halfway to Norway.My other tours are Cornwall & Lake Garda, Verona & Venice. Gorgeous!Think it's going to be a hectic summer.

{"title": "A Voice Out of History - \"Keep Calm and Carry On\"", "date": "Tuesday 9 December 2014", "text": "Ever wondered about the origin of this phrase?Well today I found out and a lot more besides.This morning I visited Alnwick a little market town up in the North East of England. It's only about fifty miles from home & my husband was going up there for a work trip so I thought I'd go with him. I had visions of browsing around the lovely little place with it's shops which are very different to the usual high street chains while I was waiting for my husband & then sitting in a nice little cafe for lunch. The best laid plans as they say, gang aft aglee! The shop my husband was visiting was out of the town so I had to sit in the car & wait for him. On the way back I suggested we stop for coffee somewhere in the town but as usual my husband drove straight on & out of the town. Nowhere to park! However just before we left I suggested we stop when I saw a sign for a bookshop called Barter Books. I thought coffee is usually available in big bookshops & this was a big bookshop!It was a lovely Victorian railway station & one of the many closed due to the horrendous Beeching railway cuts of 1968. It had been converted into a great bookshop.  Apparently this station was a very grand one for such a little market town because Alnwick was the seat of the Dukes of Northumberland. Posh or what!I couldn't take photos of the outside because of all the cars parked there but you can see it in the video below. Also I didn't have my camera, just used the camera on my phone which I have very little idea about.Inside the shop was amazing! Blazing coal fires, masses & masses of bookcases, murals, coffee (30p) & delicious freshly made biscuits (55p), play area with toys, a model railway running around above the bookcases, murals & lots more. My kind of place. I hate those soulless minimalist shops all glass & steel. YUK!I particularly loved the murals & quotations all over the shop, especially this one about books. Very forward thinking for 1957!Well back to the Keep Calm & Carry on motto. Apparently an original poster designed during World War 2 & never issued was found here in Barter Books. Take a look at the fantastic shop & the story of the poster here.Well I never would have found that wonderful shop if we had stopped for coffee in the town. Sadly I was almost dragged out of the shop as soon as I finished my coffee so no time to browse.However just as we were leaving I got my eye on the most tremendous bargains. Packs of secondhand paperbacks, 6 for £1.20. The one I picked was thrillers;it included books by Val MacDermid, Michael Dibden (fantastic), Ian Rankin, Kathy Reichs, Sue Grafton & Michael Connolly. Crumbs how cheap is that! I can give them to a charity shop too once I've read them.I have to go back but this time by myself so I can take as long as I like to soak up that place. Just gorgeous!!!!!!So if you love books & ever find you're in Northumberland, why not take a look! You won't be disappointed."},
{"title": "All Sorts of Everything!", "date": "Monday 1 December 2014", "text": "Lindisfarne CastleApologies but I'm pretty hopeless at posting these days.  I'm convinced we only have 3 day weeks now.  I just seem to get up in the morning & a couple of days have gone!  Maybe I've slept through!  It's a sign of old age, mind you it does seem to be worse in winter.  Christmas has a lot to answer for.  Thankfully we don't have Thanksgiving here or I'd be to take away!This week I decided to buy my husband a laptop for his combined Christmas & birthday presents.  Well his old one has been driving him batty for a few months now.  My fault really, I've loaded it with photos of my trips & grandchildren.  Well it has taken me hours & hours to set it up for him.  I've lost a weekend. Thought it would be a doddle like it was with my little Nokia tablet but no.  The basic set up was fine.  However I won't go into the problems I had with the laptop after I downloaded Google Chrome because I just can't hack Internet Explorer.  YUK!!!!  After that I set up his email.  Problem?  Well I just couldn't get his BT Internet email to load.  Gmail was OK but crumbs I spent hours on trying to sort it. Eventually I discovered that it & a lot of other Internet email systems just aren't compatible with Windows 8 because they're using old technology.  Just wonder why my bills are so huge if they're not updating their stuff.  Spending too much time with their BT Infinity broadband kingdom!  Their advert is running as I type, hence the large bills.  Wonderful!  Well he'll just have to manage with Gmail.  Now I have to train him to use Windows 8. Takes a bit of getting used to after XP & Vista but I do like it.  Works great with my phone too.  I've written this post on the little Nokia Lumia tablet & it's been so easy uploading the photos from One Drive & so fast too.  I treated myself to a keyboard cover with an extra battery & it's brill!  Great for when I'm on tour.What else?  Well I've been making lots of different things over the last few weeks. Sorry the picture quality isn't brilliant.Some knitted poppies to wear for Remembrance Sunday. I always buy them but keep losing them so I decided to make some.  I don't have a pattern so every time I make one it's slightly different which is nice. Some candy cane ornament holders for the Christmas Fair at my granddaughter's school. The pattern is here.  There are some good patterns there you just have to register there first....... and some little snow socks to hold the candy canes too! The pattern for these is here Still need to make some baby doll's clothes for one granddaughter for Christmas before they go to France & to crochet a matinee coat for a niece's baby who is due this week.I'm trying my hand at designing a scarf in lace wool & writing the pattern.  Don't bother watching this space, it may not come to anything with everything else that's going on.Oh I nearly forgot.  I made a crocheted snowman hat for my granddaughter (which I forgot to take photograph of)!  My daughter bought her the mitts but there wasn't a snowman hat she liked to match so I had to make one!Apart from the crafty stuff I've helped load a container from our local churches with aid for a community in Zambia.  I couldn't believe how many sports T shirts & running gear from marathons & fun runs there was.  Zillions!  It took groups of us three mornings to fill it.  One of our priests goes out to Zambia each year to work with a congregation & their priest comes back with him to our parish.I'm still listening to children read at my granddaughter's school & they've very kindly invited the volunteers to go on the pantomime trip with the whole school. I had a wonderful time last year.  The bus ridge was great before we even got there.  Not sure whether I enjoyed watching & listening to the children's reactions or the pantomime.  The comments were great.  One boy asked whether the ugly sisters were really women!  They weren't but I wasn't going there!  Loved every minute of it.  Well apart from the numerous trips to the loo!  This year it's Little Red Riding Hood.  Goodness knows what the comments will be. Also went on a retreat last month.  I haven't done that since I was at school.  It was nothing like those ones.  I haven't laughed so much for years.  The photo at the top is of Holy Island, Lindisfarne, where we spent the time.  I'll do a separate post on it as I took a few photos & it's a lovely place. I was asked to apply for a tour manager post with another tour company which specialises in UK tours & cruises.  Wasn't too keen at first but filled the application form in which took hours!  Full of what you would do in hypothetical situations & what kind of person I am.  Crumbs!  Then they wanted a CV!  Think I must be daft.What haven't I done?No decorating unfortunately.  Light isn't good enough now, a great excuse.  Not a lot of housework either but as my friend says \"nobody on their death bed ever wishes they'd done more housework\".  I keep saying I might be the first.  No cruise booked for my 70th birthday, dithered around too long & the one I'd been considering is fully booked. Not much Christmas shopping done either.  Mainly because I don't know what to buy.  For once my granddaughters haven't asked for anything much.  Nor has my grandson but there's time yet.  It's his birthday next week so it will probably be a money job.  Will have to get onto the Internet methinks.Well time to go!"},
{"title": "The Austrian Lakes", "date": "Thursday 23 October 2014", "text": "I took my first European tour to Austria in July & it took us two days to get there. First leg of the trip was via the Eurostar to Brussells Midi station & then on to Cologne where we stayed overnight. I loved the Eurostar; it was the first time I had travelled on it & we went first class. Fabulous! I don't think I'll ever enjoy air travel again.Second day we travelled from Cologne along the Rhine Valley to Salzburg. What fantastic scenery, castles or rather schlosses & lovely valleys & mountains. It took over seven hours but it was a wonderful journey. It's so great being able to get up & walk around, go to the loo, have a trip to the buffet & stretch your legs. I had to laugh though, when I went along the carriages to check if everyone was OK one chap kept asking how much longer to get there. Just like when you take children anywhere by car. He couldn't understand why we were taking a scenic route when a fast train would get us there just the same. You wonder why people book holidays without checking the itinerary. Well we eventually arrived & next morning we had a ferry trip out onto the lake. It had been absolutely pouring an hour before but by the time we went onto the ferry it started to brighten up. This photo was taken from inside the ferry as it was raining a little, it's not particularly clear & you can see some reflection in the photo. Traunkirchen Parish ChurchThe weather brightened up quickly as we finished our little lake cruise. Now I'm not a fan of cemetaries but around the side of the church was a lovely little cemetary. The graves were beautifully kept. However what puzzled me is how small they were. At first I wondered whether they were children but I looked at a few of the headstones & whole families were in there! Maybe they were cremated!There was a ferry landing beside the church which we used to travel up the lake.Lake TraunseeHere's a view from the hill above the church looking down on the lake.The cafe at the bottom right of the photo sold fabulous ice cream!It's amazing how fast the weather can change in areas where there are lakes & mountains. I took the photo above to try out the camera on a new tablet I had bought but it was so bright I couldn't see what I was taking. Didn't turn out so bad.Then I walked across the road towards the lake & in that few minutes this was how the light changed. It was still warm so I went for a swim just past that bridge. It was fresh but not freezing. A back street!And AnotherAnother View of the LakeThis part of Austria is suffering economically as it doesn't have the advantage of all year round tourism. No skiing here! The photograph above shows a shop & guest house which has closed. An Antique Shop in a Former LifeSadly there were a few shops & cafes which had closed in this really small village. One of our day trips was to the beautiful village of Hallstatt. We went there by train & then across the lake by ferry. It was gorgeous. It's the most photogenic place I've ever visited. Sadly it was a little crowded.HallstattAs you approached by ferry across the lake the houses & shops looked as it they were growing out of the mountain. The reflections in the lake are wonderful.The houses cafes & shops around the central square were really pretty with their beautiful colours & flower boxes.I climbed up to the Catholic church below (lost count of how many steps) At the top once again I found a beautiful little cemetary.Another day we visited Gmunden a small town across the lake very famous for its ceramics. A few people didn't like it but I did. I loved the colours that the houses were painted even though it was a rainy day it still looked pretty.Gmunden's GlockenspielThe glockenspiel on the town hall which still plays wasn't made locally as their ceramics weren't suitable. It was made in Meissen!The main town square looking pretty dismal. No different to anywhere else when it rains!I'll save Salzburg for another day!"},

Although Brian Wilson is in it, plus Bengal tiger, it's not quite as we remember it!It's visually stunning with a diverse range of singers & musicians. It took a year to make & was produced to launch the new BBC Music site. They couldn't have picked a better song. Apparently it's a global collection of singers I just wish I knew who half of them are! Shows I'm getting old.I wondered about whether to add the original & after Granny Annies comment I have. So here's the original. Enjoy!"},

If it erupts there could be tons of volcanic ash created and an exclusion zone in place of hundreds of miles to prevent the dust from destroying aeroplane engines. I remember the disruption that caused in Northern Europe four years ago.Now why is this news affecting my grandchildren? Because they're due to fly to Disney World, Florida in 10 days!I feel a cruise coming on!"},
{"title": "Edinburgh", "date": "Monday 28 July 2014", "text": "Princes Street GardensMy Scottish Tour started & finished in Edinburgh. It's years since I was there & I'd forgotten how lovely a place it is. To be honest when I've been there before I've been with friends & family who just wanted to shop & eat so I didn't see much of the city. This time I was on my own so could wander about to my heart's content & the weather was perfect for it.I love Princes' Street Gardens. It's hard to believe that when you're walking along in these beautiful gardens the main street & all the city's traffic is running along parallel to it. The first thing I did was to find the floral clock. I remember being fascinated by this when I was little. I found it but sadly it wasn't working, think I was too early. The design had been laid out but there were no pointers on it. Floral clock - minus pointers!An authentic Scottish thistle!There seem to be dozens of monuments in Edinburgh wherever I went I came across them.Sir Walter Scott MonumentThe Call 1914 - The Scots American War Memorial A tribute to Scottish soldiers who died during WW1The week we arrived in Edinburgh they had a new tram system!It looked rather good even though it had caused a lot of problems with the escalating costs!Looking Down Princes StreetHowever I have to say that the power lines & poles have made a bit of a mess of the lovely view along Princes Street.I suppose most cities look good on a lovely sunny day. I loved this little cafe which was next to the hotel we were staying in. I had to laugh at the sign they had put up. I've enlarged it below.Now just in case you don't know, it's taking a pop at Starbucks. They're the ones who don't pay their taxes in the UK! Have to admit I wouldn't drink Starbucks anyway as I just don't like their coffee, I prefer Costa or M&S.This is the hotel in Waterloo Place (at the end of Prices Street) where we stayed the first night. It has a great history which I managed to get a leaflet about. Apparently it was Edinburgh's first purpose built hotel opened in 1819 for the visit of Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg. He was in the first carriage to travel down Waterloo Place. Around it were other great historical buildings. Shame about the wheelie bins!Further along from our hotel I saw a monument which interested me so on our final day I found time to wander along to find out about it. It turned out to be on Calton Hill & was one of a number of monuments up there & the views were fantastic.Calton HillI hadn't heard of him but this was a monument to the Scottish philosopher, Dugald Stewart. From here you can see right across the city.Unfinished National Memorial of Scotland, Calton HillI found it really sad to see this memorial to the soldiers & sailors who died in the Napoleonic Wars which was never finished. It was started in 1826 & was modelled on the Parthenon. Unfortunately they ran out of cash & they never completed it. They did manage to finish this one just near. It is the monument to Admiral Lord Nelson, that great Scottish nay, English sailor who died at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805. The Trafalgar Signal \" England expects that every man will do his duty\" is still flown on Trafalgar Day (21 October) weather permitting.                          It looks like a huge stone telescope & contains a time ball which is dropped at 1 o'clock daily. From here you get a fantastic view of the city & across to the sea. Here are some random photographs.                                          This was the room where we had our Scottish meal on our final night. It was a beautiful room & we had a piper, a lovely Scottish highland dancer & haggis, neeps & tatties! A great finish to our tour."},
{"title": "Food Crochet & Granny Squares ", "date": "Friday 25 July 2014", "text": "My granddaughter Lauren has just started to crochet. She's left handed but knits right handed. However when I started to teach to crochet her she couldn't use the hook in her right hand, she had to use her left hand. My problem was that although I can knit left handed, I just couldn't crochet with my left hand. So I just had to explain to her how the crochet hook worked and made new loops! She seemed to be able to use it in her own way.We started off a few weeks ago with just a simple chain & then stitching it in rounds to make a coaster. Then she crochet a chain with two contrasting colours, her idea not mine! We weren't sure what to do with the long chain she made but I suggested she crocheted a chain from it. It turned out really nice & chunky & she used it for to tie her hair.She wanted to progress so we moved on to double chain, I think that's single chain in USA. Her first attempt with about 20 double chains. It got narrower as she progressed as she was missing out a stitch on each row. It wasn't a problem. I made another matching piece & stitched them together, made a chain to tie it & she had a skirt for Barbie!I made some crochet food last year which Lauren loved. So we looked at some foodie patterns on the Garnstudio site & she decided she wanted to make a carrot! It was a bit out of her league just yet with all the increasing so I made it for her. Then I made a clementine.She's certainly got me interested in crocheting again. So much so that I've spent hours looking at some absolutely gorgeous stuff on people's blogs & not just crocheting!I love Lucy's Blog Attic 24. She has such a great eye for colour & some really beautiful designs. She also gives us an insight into her home and her lifestyle.Another blog I love is Bunny Mummy Jacquie. Like Lucy she gives us an insight to her daily life with gorgeous photos and colourful designs and tutorial. They are both wonderful at producing tutorials on how to make their designs. Brilliant!Zjizjipke (I have no idea what this means) is a Dutch site with an English translation, lots of lovely crafty ideas & designs along with some lovely cat photos. This crochet blanket is absolutely beautiful & I would love to have a try at it. However think I'd pop my clogs long before it was finished. She has a tutorial for the squares on the site which I might have a go at to make cushions! I have to be realistic.Another site I absolutely love is Jenny of elefantz. She has some gorgeous sewing ideas and lots of wonderful free crafty stuff. Her photos and tutorials are fabulous.Then I went to the Garnstudio website. I buy lots of the DROPS wool at very reasonable prices. Their knitting patterns are wonderful designs but they are not well written if you're used to Patons & Sirdar style patterns. They have some beautiful crochet shawl & blanket patterns. Not sure how well the crochet ones are written as I've only made the food which was OK.Here's my favourite blanket, Latte Macchiato!It's not the gorgeous bright colours of some of the ones I've been looking at but I love the muted shades and the different designs of the squares. It could be easily adapted to brighter shades."},

However if I do that it would be like War & Peace so I'll just give the highlights.I couldn't take many photographs when I was working, looks like I'm on holiday. So My photos were taken in my free time, which wasn't a lot until the Sunday which was the passengers' free day & mine!We had a great smooth crossing on a glorious warm & sunny day, from Heysham Port on the North West Coast. The crossing to Douglas was very smooth, just as well because we were on the boat for over 4 hours.Our hotel was on the promenade in Douglas which seems to stretch for miles. It has lovely little areas of gardens with seats which were set down sheltering you from the breezes. Lots of the people on the tour used to walk the full length of the promenade in the evening after dinner.The buildings along the promenade are lovely old terraces many of which were used to house the forces during World War 11. There were palm trees too! They don't get severe winter weather here.                                                                                  Further along the promenade from our hotel was a lovely park, shopping & cafe area called the Villa Marina. The Isle of Man has a wonderful transport network. There's an excellent bus service but there are also steam trains, electric trams, a mountain railway & here below is the amazing horse drawn tram service. The trammers as the horses are known pull the carriages along the full length of the promenade from the Ferry Terminal at one end to Derby Castle, the Electric Train Terminal.I think this one was Robert. The horses are wonderful and they are well cared for unlike the ones we see in other parts of the world. They do a limited number of runs or rather trots the length of the promenade, I think it was four & then they swap the horses over. The horse sheds are at the side of the promenade.They retire after about 15 years and they are well cared for at the rest home for old horses, ponies & donkeys. You can visit them too at Bulrhenny.I'll stop now. There's more to come!"},

Sorry I haven't been around for a while, not due to any real problems just the usual ones that life throws up every now and again plus I really do need a new computer but I'm too mean to buy one.The little chick above is one of the the things I've been busy with for a little while. Well not just that one, I've knitted twenty seven of them Mostly for the children we teach to knit as a little Easter present but also for my grandchildren and my sister's.It wasn't my chick pattern, I got it here if anyone wants it. I got twenty chicks out of a 100 gram ball of double knitting so not too expensive.Here's a batch of them sitting on the dresser all waiting for their cream eggs to fill them up! When I went to buy the eggs I noticed that the cream eggs are twice the price they were last year. Last year they were 6 for a pound, this year they are £1.99! The result of Nestle buying up Cadbury's? Well anyway they looked great and to be honest I hated to part with them.They are exactly the right size for the cream eggs and all the children loved them. The hardest bit was getting the beaks and their eyes straight. The funny thing was that they all had different expressions. Have a wonderful holiday, hope the sun keeps shining and the wind and rain keeps away for us all."},

{"title": "I'm going to the Isle of Man!", "date": "Saturday 18 January 2014", "text": "The Sound, Isle of Man         Source:Wiki CommonsI was disappointed at not being able to do the Elbe river cruise I was allocated but I've got a lovely one on the vintage railways of the Isle of Man.I've wanted to go there for a while after seeing films made there but have to admit I don't know a lot about the island. So I've started a bit of research.It's a British Crown Dependency and like Jersey & Guernsey it's self governing but they are not part of the UK, The Commonwealth of Nations or the EU. Facts I didn't know. It even has its own flag!The Isle of Man is situated in the Irish Sea between Ireland and the British Isles and is 33 miles long and 13 miles wide. In 2012 its population was 85,284.Legend has it that the Irish Giant Finn MacCooill in a battle threw a chunk of earth towards Scotland. It landed in the Irish Sea & it became the Isle of Man.Now I'm not sure about the legend but it looks a lovely island with a very varied landscape. Its coastline is about 100 miles with some long sandy beaches in the north of the island and rocky cliffs with sheltered bays around the rest of it.There are lots of things to see and do around the island. With over 10,000 years of history there are ancient monuments, lots of heritage sites, castles, forts, mines as well as parks, nature reserves and wildlife attractions. We'll have a Heritage Pass included in our tour so it will mean we can visit as many places as we like, if we have the time! I also found that there are Dark Sky Sites for stargazing. Due to the natural tranquility of the Island there is little light pollution and on occasions you can see the Northern Lights!Apart from all those things & the lovely scenery there's the railways! We are going on their horse drawn trams which are apparently known locally as Toast Racks! Now when we go on holiday I'm very reuctant to use transport provided by horses as I always worry about how they are treated. Well I checked this one out and it looks like they are very well cared for. They even have a sanctuary, the Home of Rest for Old Horses, where when they retire, usually after about 15 years, the horses are looked after.Next we go on the Snaefell Mountain Railway which dates from 1895 and is the only electric mountain railway in the British Isles. It takes us to the summit of Snaefell, 2036 feet!We also travel on a 17 mile journey on the Manx Electric Railway from Douglas to the harbour town of Ramsey in the north east of the island. It's the longest narrow gauge vintage railway in the British Isles and we'll be travelling in the oldest working tramcars in the world!Another railway we'll be travelling on is the Isle of Man Steam Railway, the island's oldest Victorian rail system which uses restored heritage carriages. Well it all sounds great to me and I hope to get lots of photos. I'll let you know how I get on in May."},

It's many years since I was in Edinburgh but I've never been to the Highlands or any of the Scottish islands so I'm really looking forward to it. Just hope the weather is good in June.I was also allocated a river cruise from Prague to Berlin which I was delighted about but unfortunately it hit right on my granddaughter's First Holy Communion so sadly I couldn't do it. Never mind I'll wait to see what else I've been allocated.Meanwhile I've completed the training, absorbed mountains of information and now I have to start my own research for the tour.

My lap top isn't connected to the Internet now. McAfee doesn't support Windows XP any longer (even though they  tell you they do, it just doesn't work) and neither does Microsoft so I've had to disconnect the laptop from the Internet. Now I rely on getting access to my husband's computer which limits the time I have on it.Santa didn't bring me a Mac which I was hoping for but maybe next year. I just don't like tablets or iPads and I really need a laptop with real computer programmes & a printer.One nice thing I hope will motivate me & that I'll be able to blog about is after 6 years in retirement I have a job! I'm starting work next year as a travel tour manager for a rail holiday company. I'll be accompanying passengers on rail journeys in the UK & Europe and I'll need to research the tour itinerarys so that's a good excuse for a new laptop. I'm hoping to see places I've never travelled to before & take lots of photographs. So I'm hoping to do a lot better with blogging next year.Meanwhile here's a few photographs from our last cruise holiday.A very modern Christmas Tree in Paradise Island, NassauNow I have no idea how the twinkling was added. It just popped up on my Google+ page. Magic! Paradise Island again I thought these shops looked a lot like Disney World. The pastel colours were lovely.I really liked these pastel coloured buildings near the dock at Paradise Island. Not sure whether they were holiday homes.Celebrity EclipseWe left the ship after our transatlantic crossing form Southampton. This is the Eclipse leaving Fort Lauderdale for her first Caribbean cruise of the season. We were surprised to be able to watch it from our hotel room balcony. We had an amazing view of the harbour & could see all the cruise ships leaving. Didn't see many arrive as they were usually docking very early morning.St Sebastian's Church, Fort LauderdaleWent to a lovely service here where they very kindly offered visitors a lift back to their hotels. Enjoyed the art & craft fair too where they had a pancake brakfast. St MaartenI took quite a few pictures of the many lovely houses we saw on the river ferry at Fort Lauderdale. Would quite like a bit of that lovely sunshine at the moment. It's very damp and grey!I won't bore you with any more! For the moment anyway.Have a great year everyone in 2014!"},

I have to say I love them!This summer I took a trip down memory lane (to be truthful I took a few) and visited Beamish Open Air Museum which is very close to where we live. I'm ashamed to say I hadn't been there for over twenty years. I'm just not really a tourist in this country.Well it has been such a fantastic summer that I went with my daughter & granddaughter in June & then went back a couple more times. My granddaughter Lauren is obsessed with this place and loves talking about \"the olden days\".It's a living museum which reflects how people lived and worked in the Georgian, Edwardian and Victorian times in the North East of England. There's a town, a colliery, a pit village, a farm, a railway station and an old hall. So much to see that it's hard to get around in a single day. So we started our visit on the tram which runs from the entrance down into the town. There's a few different ones but we just get on the first one that arrives!I think this red & cream tram was the one that was going out to California after the summer.There are buses too and specially adapted accessible ones.All the drivers and conductors are volunteers. In fact there are very few paid staff there.Here we are down in the town and at the band stand. You might recognise this from the telly as some programmes have been filmed here. The one I remember was First of the Summer Wine which ran for a couple of seasons.The little park area is a good place to picnic.The sweet shop always has to be the first stop for Lauren. We try to get there early as the queues soon form!At the back of the shop they make a lot of old fashioned sweets and Lauren loves to watch them. Her favourite choice is the raspberry drops. However she's not averse to a bit of cinder toffee! They have regular demonstrations of the sweet making. Here they are making the raspberry drops and there are plenty of free samples to be had!After that she likes to go into the old houses. They have been rebuilt and the rooms have the original furniture.They are quite posh, you can tell by the quality of the furniture and the carpets and would have been occupied by middle class folk like doctors, dentists, teachers etc. This one has a nursery!This one has a bathroom with an inside loo. Really posh!One of the houses is a dental surgery.  Yuck!One of the days we were there a young man was playing the part of the dentist and telling us all about what his work involved. He explained how young ladies of wealthy families were brought to him to have all their teeth removed for their 21st birthdays. This meant they had lovely pearly white teeth so that their future husbands wouldn't have any expensive dental treatment to pay for. One young lad said \"What if they didn't want their teeth out\"? The dentist said \"Tough, they do as they're told\". The young lad's expression was a picture. Here's the display cabinet wiith sets of pearly white teeth and skulls!My favourite is the Co-op shop, I love it. It brings back lots of memories of my sister and I doing the shopping for my Mam on Saturday mornings. Inside was exactly like this just bigger.

{"title": "The Lindisfarne Gospels Exhibition ", "date": "Tuesday 1 October 2013", "text": "\"One Amazing Book – One Incredible Journey\", that's how the press described The Lindisfarne Gospels which has been on display for three months in a wonderful exhibition staged on Durham’s World Heritage Site in the Palace Green Library. Even the buses were customised with the exhibition's logo.The Lindisfarne Gospels is one of the greatest books ever created, a masterpiece of European book painting. The exhibition presents the full story of how and why it was created.  The Lindisfarne Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John was created by one man, the monk Eadfrith, Bishop of Lindisfarne at the end of the 7th and beginning of 8th Centuries in the priory on the holy island of Lindisfarne in Northumbria. Lindisfarne Priory, Lindisfarne           Source Wiki CommonsThey were written \"in honour of God and Saint Cuthbert\". Saint Cuthbert is one of the North's honoured saints who is buried in Durham Cathedral. It would have taken 129 calf skins to produce this book. The text was written in Latin and beautifully illustrated, bound in leather and studded with precious jewels and metals. The Lindisfarne gospels is the most amazing example of 7/8th Century Anglo Saxon Northumbrian art. In the 10th Century an English translation was added between the lines and it is the earliest surviving English translation of the gospels. The illustrations are amazing. The colours are still vibrant despite the passage of time. This is the page that was on display when I visited the exhibition, it's the page which begins St Mark's Gospel. Source Wiki CommonsEach gospel has an illustration of the saint and then a carpet page follows it. They are named carpet pages because they resemble oriental rugs. This is the carpet page for St Matthew's Gospel. The detail is absolutely wonderful.Source - Wiki CommonsYou can see more here on the British Library's website. However this doesn't give you any perception of the beauty and the amazing detail of this manuscript or how on earth one man produced it in such difficult conditions. No central heating, no electricity, and no modern equipment.The Lindisfarne Gospels was written at a time of great upheaval in Britain and you can read more about them on the BBC website, how due to the Viking invasions they had to leave Lindisfarne and eventually found their home in Durham Cathedral along with the body of Saint Cuthbert. The Gospels survived in almost perfect condition despite Viking raids, the Dissolution of the Monasteries by Henry V111, wars and the ravages of time. The book is now kept in the British Library in London and only goes out for exhibition every seven years for a maximum of three months. I thoroughly enjoyed the exhibition, seeing the wonderful collection of artefacts brought from a wide range of sources telling the amazing story of people's faith, creativity and courage.Sadly now the exhibition has ended, the book has travelled back to the British Library in London where it is kept on display for the world's visitors to view. I must admit I feel very strongly that it should remain in Durham Cathedral with Saint Cuthbert, the saint it was created to honour. Religious books don't belong in museums, they belong in places of worship like this. If you ever get the chance to visit Durham Cathedral, take it! It was recently voted the UK's Number One Landmark by Tripadvisor users. It is often described as the greatest example of Romanesque architecture in Europe however the US author Bill Bryson described it as \"The best cathedral on planet earth\" and I agree with him!Durham CathedralDurham Cathedral"},
{"title": "Why Do They Make Things So Difficult?", "date": "Tuesday 23 July 2013", "text": "I finally got around to doing some ironing yesterday. Well it's been too hot recently so there was quite a mountain. I noticed that two pairs of white trousers had nasty yellow marks all over the legs so I put them back into the wash. My sister told me it was probably the sun tan cream, she had the same problem with a top she had worn last year. So I went online to look for ways to get rid of the marks & to find out more about the creams & maybe which ones to avoid in future. I found a suggestion for soaking the clothes in white vinegar and detergent which I will try. Unfortunately I didn't find any information about which creams to avoid this problem in future. None of the websites selling the sunscreens tell you that their products don't stain your clothes. So I assume they probably all do!What I did find was some really interesting information abut sun protection which I didn't know about ie the different UV radiation which requires you to look for not only the SPF factor which protects you against UVB rays but also the star rating for the UVA protection.I have to admit that when I buy sun cream I always buy one for myself with a high SPF protection, usually 30 for my body and for my face I use an SPF 40. My husband generally uses 15 or 20 as he has darker skin than me. What I hadn't realised was that these SPFs only protect you against the UVB rays and that you also have to look for the protection against UVA radiation which has a star rating up to 5. Now why didn't I know that!!!!!Apparently in Europe the UVA protection has to be at least a third of the SPF rating so if you use an SPF 30 then the UVA protection has to be a 10. I checked out the SPF 30 spray I've been using & it shows only 3 stars! Now how that equates to a 10 rating which is what it should be I have no idea! I checked out the website for the sun cream I've been using but it had no information about the need to use sun protection at all never mind what UVA protection is in their products. It only gave the SPF rating. I found a simple factual video to explain things here on the NHS website.So why are these companies making it so difficult for people to choose decent protection for UVA & UVB? I think these companies are missing a trick here as they should be broadcasting how their products are providing this extra protection. They should also let you know whether or not their products stain clothes!!In my meandering about the Internet I found some very interesting information about sun tan lotions and their contents on a US website, the Environmental Working Group. It has some very good information about sunscreens with a useful guide, how to choose them and which to avoid. You can search for your own specific cream/spray/lotion etc to see how it's rated, well if it's an American one. It also tells you the types of sunscreens and which contents to avoid.What I hadn't realised in my ignorance about sunscreens is that the US is only now introducing regulations about sunscreens. According to the US Skin Cancer Foundation currently only the largest manufacturers have to follow the new labelling system. Half of the sunscreen products approved by the FDA (Food & Drug Administration) for sale in the US wouldn't make it to the shelves in Europe. I had assumed that given the hot climate in much of the USA that they would have very strict regulation of sunscreens. Maybe people are like me & have assumed that they are protected with a high SPF in their creams. In the UK we often moan about the EU regulations but sometimes they really do work for us.So if you want to check out some more facts about suncreams go to the Environmental Working Group  website. It's very interesting and informative.Well now I feel genned up after checking all this out and I'm about to throw out my current lotions and buy new ones now I know what I'm looking for! Just hope they have the star factors or I'll be on a mission and writing to the manufacturers."},

In fact it would have said: \"Effort - Poor\". Maybe some people might have thought I popped my clogs, but no. I'm still around.So what's my excuse? Well to be truthful, I don't have one. I've just got involved in other things like:listening to children read at a local primary school. I enjoy that & it's surprising how they improve with just a few extra minutes spent with them.fundraising for the Apostleship of the Sea. I volunteered a while ago for this & recently we went to Lindisfarne (Holy Island) on a \"pilgrimage\". Well it did involve prayers, hymns  & a Mass but there were also some visits to coffee shops & a pub for lunch. Not really like the original pilgrims! It's a tidal island if you ever visit & is only accessible via the causeway when the tide is out. So you need to know the times of the tides if you ever visit.Lindisfarneknitting - lace shawls for a couple of friends & some cardigans for myself. This is my favourite shawl. It's a Nancy Bush Estonian one & really lovely.                                  teaching children to knit at a local primary school. I'm amazed at how popular this is, they almost fight each other for a turn at knitting & that includes the boys!making medieval dresses for my granddaughters. I made a Rapunzel dress last year when Lauren went to Orlando & so it was time to make them for the other two girls!watching my diet and cooking more natural foods since I joined Weightwatchers. I really don't like cooking so my repertoire is mainly soup, salmon, tuna, salads and pastas. Not exactly James Martin or Michel Roux!swimming more to help lose weight and get my blood pressure down so I don't have to take the dreaded tablets & get our GP more cash for reaching her targets!now that I've finally lost some weight I've been altering as many pairs of trousers as I can so I'm not hitching them up with a belt & I know I'm saving some cash by avoiding buying new ones.taking my turn at desktop publishing our three local churches' newsletter & keeping their website up to date. Quite a struggle as my old Dell laptop is on its last legs, crashing & freezing regularly which makes these jobs and  blogging really difficult. Hope Santa Clause has an iMac in his sack for me this Christmas.looking for cheap cruises! I never succeed as I'm too fussy about the cruiseline, neither of us like mega ships and my husband doesn't like inside cabins and getting off the ship! So the really cheap offers are never suitable. A transatlantic with a stop at a couple of nice places suits us both. I managed to drag him off the ship in Bermuda! Our next one is on a bigger ship, Celebrity Eclipse for my husband's 70th birthday and on the way to Florida we're going to stop at a couple of Caribbean Islands. Now I've never been to the Caribbean so I'm really looking forward to it. Watch this space! I promise to blog about it.So I haven't exactly been lazing about but I really need to get blogging again so I'll be dropping in to see you and catch up with you soon."},

{"title": "Making Mode", "date": "Saturday 23 February 2013", "text": "Well that's what it feels like. I've finished my latest lace shawl and the Aran jacket I knitted for myself (using up wool I've had for 15 years) so I've been making things for my granddaughter, a knitted chick and a Minnie Mouse crochet hat. Have to say I'm not very good at taking photos of stuff I've made but I must give it a try. Now I'm desperate to start knitting a cardigan for our holidays next month. I've looked around the shops and can't see anything I like for under £40! I stopped knitting things for myself years ago because the wool got so expensive but now most of the jumpers & cardigans in the shops are that awful acrylic stuff. Even M&S have no pure wool jumpers in other than the odd cashmere one which isn't what I want and I'd need a mortgage for it.We don't have any decent wool shops in our town so I end up buying it on the Internet. I really like the DROPS wools which are very reasonably priced. Shame non of the shops near us have this wool, the nearest is Berwick, about 60 miles away and they don't have a lot of stock. So mine gets ordered from Aberdeen and the staff are so helpful!There are thousands of free patterns available on the Garnstudio website. Have to say the designs are lovely but the patterns are not particularly well written like the Paton & Baldwins & Sirdar patterns. I'm glad I'm not a beginner or I'd be tearing my hair out. I usually end up cutting and pasting the text & then writing it out properly, just in case I want to use it again. Now I can't wait for the wool to be delivered. It's a bit hit & miss not seeing or worse still not touching the wool but I'm pretty sure it will be fine. It's 75% wool and machine washable. I've used their lace wool and it's gorgeous to knit with and washes well.This is the pattern I fancied. Loved the colours in this, it was called Fun Lilac although it seemed to have more red in it to me.However they didn't have it & wouldn't be getting it for a month so I opted for my second choice of Blue /Turqoise. A bit duller but it will go with most of my clobber which tends to be blue, navy or turquoise.Not sure whether I'll want to do that pattern in the blue, might do this one (it looks easier and quicker) then order some more wool later for the first pattern.The wool usually comes very quickly with first class post but you can guarantee it gets delivered the moment I pop out to the shops. Yes that's exactly what happened today & now I'll have to go & collect it from the Post Office. So no getting started tonight it will have to wait until tomorrow.I found a few more cardis that I like:Can't justify buying all that wool though. Well not this month anyway! Maybe just one more batch next week!Just in case you're wondering, no I'm not advertising, I don't participate in Google ads. Just thought I'd share the information about the wool in case you have the same problems getting wool that I do."},

Well that's what I thought but when I looked it up Facebook has created a whole new vocabulary their product. \"unfriend\" is not just a verb it's a noun too.   Apparently, \"Unfriends are people who were previously your friend but have either deactivated their account or have removed you from their friendlist\". So there! It's official. There's even an Unfriend Finder website should you be desperate to find out who is unfriending you & why. What's worse there's an Unfriendable website. Good grief there's a whole \"unfriend\" industry out there.What's really naffing me off is that Google ads too keep popping up telling me I've been \"unfriended\". What I want to do is use the immortal words of Lauren aka Catherine Tate and say \"Look at my face!

{"title": "My Local Library", "date": "Monday 4 February 2013", "text": "The Green LibraryWhen I retired I decided I wasn't going to buy any more books. Well I needed to cut back on spending and to be truthful I'd filled all the shelves in the house yet there were still books lying around.So I decided to buy books from the local charity shops. I was never going to get the latest editions but the books were quite cheap & at least I was contributing to charities. After I'd read them I used to either hand them back in or leave them wherever I went on holiday. I came across some great books that way. A couple I held on to were the David Niven ones, The Moon's a Balloon & Bring on the Empty Horses. They are absolute gems & I wouldn't part with them. If you haven't read them & want a good laugh as well as an insight into the life of a wonderful film star in the Hollywood of the 'thirties, 'forties & 'fifties, try them.Well over the last couple of years the books have got pretty expensive at the charity shops. It's cheaper buying them at shops where they get rid of old stocks & then handing them into the charity shops so at least there's still a contribution to them.So I decided to start to use our local library again. I hadn't used it for years as I never had time when I was working. I used to use it when I walked the children to school or I would take them in on the way home. It's a small branch which only opens for a few days a week. I decided to support them as the council cut backs have been affecting libraries for quite a while now. I'd hate to see it close as it provides a wonderful service for all ages. Now I take my granddaughter there after school & she loves it.Last summer they had some great craft sessions for children where they were making things relating to the Olympics. I took my granddaughter along & she made an Olympic Torch, a laurel wreath, Olympic medals & a pencil box. The staff are always great, everything was free & the children really enjoyed it.There are three libraries in Washington & surprisingly my granddaughter prefers the little old one to the other two up to date modern ones. The photo above is of the library we use, The Green Library. (Complete with blue wheelie bin). Yes the library's painted green but that's not why it has that name. I had to explain to Lauren that it's called The Green Library because it is situated on the Village Green. She gave me a withering look that said \"That's what she thinks\"! As they do, well let's face it, what do we know?Washington Village GreenIt's very close to Washington Old Hall which is the ancestral home of the Wessingtons (George Washington's ancestors). If I remember correctly the library is just opposite the place where President Carter planted a cherry tree in Washington on the Village Green, during his UK visit in May 1977. Sadly the tree died, it had been virtually frozen in the cargo of the plane on its way across the Atlantic! Have to admit that although I've lived in Washington for over forty years I've never been into the Old Hall. Must do it this summer & maybe get some better photographs.Entrance to Washington Old HallSo do you use your local library? I know lots of people have moved over to e-readers but I have to say I haven't. I know they can be useful when you go on holiday but I really like the feel of a book & you don't have to keep charging it up. The other issue is cost. Now I would have thought it would be really cheap to buy an e book but it's not. Just been looking at some recent biographies on Amazon & quite a few e books are dearer than the hard cover editions of books. It's a bit like buying an iTune compared to a vinyl LP complete with gorgeous glossy artwork covers. There's nothing tangible for your dosh is there? I always felt like I was getting my moneysworth with my Buddy Holly & Beatles LPs. Not like with the cassettes, CDs & iTunes.Well think I'll just stick to the library for now. Even if they don't always have the specific book I would like to read. My reading list is massive and they have more than enough books on it to keep me going. Anyway I'll be helping keep our local library open for a while longer."},

Well we met at Bowes Museum really but decided to have a bit of a wander around Barnard Castle as it was such a sunny day.Barnard Castle is a small market town in Teesdale, County Durham in the North East of England. It grew up around the medieval castle which is now a ruin. The castle was built by Bernard (Barnard) Baliol in 1112. The Norman castle saw little action in its lifetime and it and fell into disrepair after the Middle Ages. Apparently much of the stonework was carted off for other buildings projects!                  As you cross the river behind the castle you can see the remains of one of the castle towers. This is a much better view of the castle, sadly not my photograph.   Barnard Castle    © Copyright Ben Gamble and licensed for reuse under this Creative Commons LicenceI love the old County Bridge below but it's not good when you're driving over it as it's so narrow. There's not much of a path either so you have to be careful crossing the road!The river was quite low the day we meandered about and the rapids were not very rapid but you can see it was more winter than autumn even though it was October. It was absolutely freezingWe didn't get onto the main street in the town but I found a good photograph of the market place. The flag of St George is flying above the church.Market Place, Barnard Castle      © Copyright Ben Gamble and licensed for reuse under thisCreative Commons LicenceThere were some really lovely old buildings but I didn't have time to take many photographs.            Blagrave's HouseBlagrave's House is apparently the oldest house in Barnard Castle.

I retired 5 years ago, one retired about 3 years before me and the other one is still working. We only live about 40 miles from each other but trying to arrange to meet seems to take us ages. We all have commitments of one sort or another however finally we made it last week.We decided to do an indoor get together as the weather has been so awful and we chose Bowes Museum in Barnard Castle. It is a beautiful place and has some amazing collections. The French style chateau was built in the 19th Century and was the first building in Britain to be designed using metric instead of the usual imperial measurements. Seems odd seeing a French chateau in the middle of County Durham but it is a beautiful building.It has a formal parterre  garden at the front and is surrounded by acres of parkland. The fountain has been restored but wasn't working when we were there. Couldn't be due to any water shortages!The day turned out to be cold but there was glorious sunshine so we started the day with a coffee in the museum and then decided it was too nice to be inside so we went for a walk around Barnard Castle. I'll save those pictures for another day. We went back to the museum for a delicious lunch and talked so much we didn't have time to tour the museum. We'll have to go back another time!My photographs were taken with my husband's camera as mine is broken and I'm not that familiar with this one so the light isn't too good. Also the pictures taken quickly as my friends were keen to get on with their walk and I didn't get as many photographs as I would have liked."},

The boyfriend didn't last the 50 years but I have enjoyed most of the Bond films since. My favourite of the Connery Bond's was the first Dr No. It was so different to any of the films being produced then & its style was copied but was never matched.Not sure who my favourite Bond is, I've liked them all even Timothy Dalton & George Lazenby. Roger Moore Source: Wiki CommonsI loved the really elegant & humorous style of Roger Moore & his voice is still wonderful. My favourite of Roger Moore's Bonds was Moonraker. Who could forget Jaws?Pierce Brosnan brought the humour, the elegance & the fabulous good looks to Bond in 4 films.                                                            Pierce Brosnan Source Wiki CommonsMy favourite of his films was the first, Goldeneye where he came up against a former friend played by Sean Bean. Sean Been always seems to play the baddie now. His posh accent in Goldeneye was really over the top but I suppose a broad Yorkshire accent wouldn't quite have matched the character. I loved the computer whiz Boris who thought he was \"invincible\". Now we have Daniel Craig and I have to say I'm not that keen on him as Bond. He was great as Mikael Blomkvist in The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo but I still don't see him as Bond.Daniel Craig Source: Wiki CommonsIt's not just that his looks differ and I know he's a really good actor. I think it's more that the style of the films has changed significantly over the Daniel Craig Bond films. They've lost some of the humour & become much darker. To be honest they're more like the Bourne series of films which were OK but frankly nothing special & not really my cup of tea.I think if I had to choose my favourite Bond, it would be Pierce Brosnan!Another great thing about the Bond films is the music. The first one Dr No introduced us to John Barry's James Bond theme & since then there have been additional themes for each film. Hard to pick my favourite there have been some fabulous songs but I think I'll opt for gorgeous voice of Matt Monro with the John Barry Orchestra & the theme song of From Russia With Love. If you get a message restricting you from watching the video just click on the Watch on YouTube  link.Now we're just waiting to see how Adele fairs with her rendition of Skyfall from the next Bond Film. I love Adele & this certainly sounds like a Bond theme but I'm not sure it's as strong as her usual songs. We'll see."},

A day of joy & celebration thanking the Team GB athletes, the final day ofthe fantastic summer of sport in 2012. Yes the weather stayed fine yet again!We thoroughly enjoyed the BBC coverage of the Olympics &were disappointed when we realised we’d be in Orlando for the Paralympics. We were evenmore disappointed when we couldn’t find any coverage of the Paralympics on TVin the hotel we were staying in. There were more than 100 channels but couldn’t findany with the Paralympics coverage. They didn’t have the BBC World Service which we were very surprised aboutand the Paralympics didn’t even seem to get a mention on the CNN or Fox Newsthe nights we watched. Maybe it was being covered on a station we didn't have. We had hoped we’d be able to enjoy the last couple ofdays at home but found it was being covered by Channel 4 complete with adverts.Total rubbish! The BBC gets a lot of flack but my goodness they excelledthemselves this summer.Today I thoroughly enjoyed watching the BBC coverage of the Mayorof London’s Olympic & Paralympic Parade. It was wonderful to see all thoseathlete’s being honoured on the parade but what was lovely was all the thankyou notices the athletes were holding up to thank everyone for supporting them.The Games Makers, police and armed forces were thanked too. They had the best places in the Mall & around the Palace for the concert.Here’s a selection of the photographs I took (from the telly, I wasn't there sadly):Jessica Ennis - The Poster Girl for London 2012One of the most successful things about London 2012 was The Volunteers or Games Makers as they were known, all 70,000 of them. Many had only volunteered for the Olympics but decided to stay on to work at the Paralympics.Probably the most famous of the Games Makers, Eddie IzzardThe amazing sailor Ben AinslieThe parade had been organised to pay tribute to the athletes and to thank them yet nearly all of the teams were carrying thank you messages to the public. There was hardly a square inch of space along the route to the Place. Health & safety regulations were flouted as people hung out of windows over roof tops & climbed lamp posts. It was the biggest crowd the capital has seen apparently. Bigger than the Diamond Jubilee & the Royal Wedding.Trafalgar SquareThe lovely Tom DaleySarah Storey Paralympic cyclist winner of 4 gold medalsEllie Symmonds Gold Medal winning Paralympic swimmer I loved these lions leading the parade, rather like Chinese dragonsKathryn Jenkins singing the national anthemNow she has an amazing voice so why didn't she sing at the Olympic ceremonies?Now who was missing from the parade?Well Andy Murray tennis gold medal winner, he's playing in the finals of the US Open & the score is currently 2 sets to 1 in his favour. Not sure I can stay awake much longer to see the result. Best of luck to him.Oh yes Wiggo wasn't there either. Bradley Wiggins the only cyclist to have won the Tour de France & an Olympic Cycling gold medal in the same year. He's doing the Tour of Britain at the moment. No rest for the wicked!

{"title": "Throw Those Curtains wide, One Day Like This a Year'd See Me Right!", "date": "Tuesday 14 August 2012", "text": "I was one of the people who had serious reservations about us hosting the Olympics in London. A real live doubting Thomas! Why? Well for a kick off, I'm not a sports enthusiast, I suffer football, Formula 1 racing, golf & even the snooker on telly & not gladly. I vividly remember 6th July 2005, the day the announcement was made and after the joy of the announcement, the following day we were all brought down to earth with a bump when those bombs went off in London. Since then like a lot of people I feared London would be a target for the terrorists during the Olympics. They had to bring in high velocity missiles on the roof tops of tower blocks and bring in troops for added security. In addition to that we are having such economic problems I felt it was hard to justify all that spending.I have to admit I was wrong. The way they carried the torch across the whole of the country & involved so many people was inspiring. However the past two weeks have surpassed that & been absolutely brilliant, the athletes, visitors, volunteers, performers, music, the venues especially the Olympic Stadium, the BBC's TV coverage and commentators, even the weather have all been fantastic. For the first time in donkeys years GB has done well at the Olympics. We are such a little country with a cool climate, insufficient investment in sport and a problematic economy. But these Games have really lifted the country in a way that's hard to describe. As Sebastian Coe said, \"We did it right\" but I have to say we all held our breath for quite a while. Not sure how long the euphoria will last given the government we have, but I'm not going down that road!There have been such amazing stories some joyful others very sad and the images will live on in my mind for years to come. The dancing horses at the dressage, Mo Farah, winning the 10,000 & 5,000 meters, Usain Bolt winning the 100 & 200 metres, the amazing Michael Phelps winning all those gold medals, Jessica Ennis getting the gold in the heptathlon after her injuries stopped her in Bejiing, Andy Murray finally getting the gold and trouncing Roger Federer a month after being so desperately about losing at Wimbledon, I do like Roger Federer though he was a very gracious loser. Then there was young, Tom Daley the diver getting his bronze in the diving after a tragic time losing his Dad, David Rudisha the quiet unassuming Kenyan winning the 800 meters (nice change after the brash Bolt), the list is endless. The tears of joy & faces of the rowers and cyclists in the velodrome and those of sadness brought the tears to my eyes so many times. One really great thing was that the volunteers or Games Makers as they were called, really did a magnificent job and they were thanked so graciously by Seb Coe & Jacques Rogge at the closing ceremony. I have to say I've never enjoyed an Olympics like this before and I did enjoy Sydney Games a lot.The past couple of days have been boring and I really don't know how I'll face Saturday nights again after the excitement of the past two Saturdays with Mo & Jess! We're back to ordinary telly now and it's dire. I suppose they just can't match the real life drama we've had for the past two weeks. I'm also missing seeing the BBC's advert for the Games and hearing that wonderful music every morning as we switched on the telly. They commissioned Elbow to do it again. Wonder how much it cost! They always seem to get such fantastic music for their Olympic Games & the World Cup coverage. Inspired! But the strange thing is I woke up this morning at about 7 o'clock with different music running through my brain. Now I'm not an early morning person but I just couldn't get back to sleep. The tune & lyrics \"So throw those curtains wide, one day like this a year'd see me right\" just kept repeating themselves. I didn't know what it was & it was driving me mad so I looked it up. Guess what? It was another Elbow song which they sang at the closing ceremony. Apparently it was the BBC's theme music for the 2008 Bejiing Games. Must be why it sounded familiar. I hadn't heard of the group but I know I'm going to have to buy their CD and I'll probably be waking up every morning to it ringing in my ears.Anyway here's a touch of Bejiing 2008 déjà vu with Elbow & the BBC Concert Orchestra:One Day Like ThisSo apart from listening to these clips, to counteract my withdrawal symptoms I'm finishing off a Rapunzel dress for my granddaughter for our visit to Orlando next week and a jacket I started to knit a couple of months ago. I might even get around to some of the housework I haven't done and oh yes, there's always the Paralympics which start in two weeks time! We'll miss some of them while we're on holiday but hopefully we'll catch some telly in the USA and in the last few days when we get back. No doubt there'll be more tears being shed again. I do love the Paralympics. I also can't wait to see that Olympic flame again it was gorgeous. It's a shame they're going to dismantle it after the Paralympics and give the copper petals to each of the 204 participating countries. No idea what the heck they'll do with them. I thought it would be a gorgeous piece of artwork to remember the 2012 Olympics.Take a look at this:Three little charmers and a gold post box!      Source: Wiki CommonsIt's in Penzance and it's the first Royal Mail Post Box to be painted gold to honour Helen Glover who grew up in the town and won a gold medal in the rowing.  Apparently the Royal Mail are going to do that with all the towns that the gold medal winning athletes live in or grew up in. Nice touch! Isn't it nice to be proved wrong, sometimes!Now bring on those Paralympics! One day like this a year'd see me right!"},
{"title": "Coventry Cathedral", "date": "Saturday 11 August 2012", "text": "When our children were young we nearly always went on holiday somewhere in Britain such as Scotland,Wales, the Lake District, Devon etc. We couldn’t afford to go abroad and our sonhad a heart defect so we didn’t risk leaving Britain. However with the family grown up for the past 15years we have got into the habit of going to the Mediterranean with my daughter and her family to get some almost guaranteed sunshine. We kept thinking we’d go back totripping around the UKwhen we were older and either couldn’t afford the trips abroad or perhaps when our healthwasn’t up to it. However last summer I started thinking that there were so many different places inthe UKthat I have never been to and it was maybe about time we started to visit them. Time could be running out, who knows!We both hate driving so I looked at the idea of a bus trip. Not everybody’s cupof tea (& definitely not my husband's) but with the price of petrol nowadays it seemed like a good idea at the time. Ifound one to the Cotswolds that was unbelievably cheap for 4 days so I bookedit.Wetravelled to Coventryand stayed at a hotel there for 3 nights. Not a flash hotel but perfectly clean and very central. Well to my surprise I enjoyed Coventry just as much as ourtrips to the Cotswolds. I always knew I was odd! I’ll post about the trips tothe Cotswold villages later.NowI’ve never been to Coventry,nor ever been sent there, unlike some of the jokers on the bus. I did know that Coventry was very badly bombed during WorldWar 2 and that their cathedral was at the heart of the destruction. I alsoremembered that they built a new and very modern cathedral designed by Sir Basil Spence, which wasconsecrated by the Queen in 1962. What surprised me when I visited the cathedral was thatthe original cathedral ruins lie alongside the new one. For some reason I had imagined ithad been totally destroyed and the new one built over the ruins.  I wondered why they hadn’t built on the originalsite but as I walked around the site I read the story and understood why. It was very moving and itmade such good sense to rebuild as they did. Having the permanent reminder of the destruction and violence of war alongside the rebuilding of that new cathedral are symbolic of the themes of evil and destruction contrasting with resurrection and reconciliation. In England themajority of our ruined churches and cathedrals are the result of the violence followingthe dissolution of the Catholic monasteries in 1539 during the reign of HenryVIII. However the ruins of the Cathedral of StMichael were a consequence of 20th Century violence. The city of Coventry was devastated by bombs dropped bythe Luftwaffe on the night of 14th November 1940. As the city burned, so didtheir cathedral.  What hadtaken centuries to perfect, took one night to destroy. In addition over 500 people were killed that night.\"The decision to rebuild the cathedral was taken the morning after its destruction.  Rebuilding would not be an act of defiance, but rather a sign of faith, trust and hope for the future of the world.  It was the vision of the Provost at the time, Dick Howard, which led the people of Coventry away from feelings of bitterness and hatred\". (Extract from Coventry Cathedral website )                      Coventry Cathedral                         Source:Wiki Commons - Steve CadmanThis photo shows the two cathedrals of St Michael, old & new, sideby side. The remains of the original Gothic cathedral are on the left and the new cathedral designed by Sir Basil Spence is on the right. We didn’t have much time to visit the cathedral as the daily bus trips we were on didn’t return until after 5pm. The first time we got there after a couple of minutes it suddenly started to rain which meant I got very few photos. The photos seem to show a really sad building in this light. However I went back early the next morning, the light was wonderful and it seemed a totally different place. These photographs are mine. Not brilliant but I think they capture the mood. The Old Sanctuary Remains in the Morning LightThis cross was formed from the remaining burnt roof timbers on the altar which were taken from the ruins. Behind the altar you can see inscribed on the walls Father Forgive. The The Litany of Reconciliation is now recited there every Friday at noon.Below is a photo of Sir Winston Churchill in 1942 walking through the ruins with the remains of the altar in the background.Source: Wiki CommonsSource: Wiki CommonsThis photo taken following the blitz of Coventry, shows wounded US soldiers who were convalescing in local hospitals. They were attending a Mothers' Day service in the ruins of the cathedral.The old buildings behind the ruins of the altar seen in the photo above, have now been replaced by Coventry University seen below. What a contrast! Not entirely sure I like it.Coventry UniversityOpposite the University is the main entrance to the cathedrals with the wonderful Epstein bronze of St Michael & the Devil on the new cathedral on the right and the old one to the left.Main Entrance              St Michael & the Devil - Sir Jacob Epstein's Bronze  Sadly Epstein didn't live to see his bronze mounted on the cathedral.

The canopy of the new cathedral looking out over the old remains.This is the area linking the two cathedrals.ReconciliationThis beautiful statue \"Reconciliation\" lies in the ruins. It was made by Josefina de Vasconcellos aged 90 and was presented to Coventry Cathedral by Richard Branson on the 50th anniversary of the end of WW2 in 1995. A replica of it was donated by the people of Coventry to the peace garden of Hiroshima and there are copies in Berlin and Northern Ireland.Also in the ruins is Ecce Homo, Epstein's statue of Christ on trial before Pontius Pilate which was presented to the cathedral by Lady Epstein. Ecce HomoLooking from the old cathedral ruins towards the new cathedral with the canopy spanning the two.Under the canopy is the amazing huge floor to ceiling glass window of the new cathedral. I took a number of photos of this window which, each section is engraved with angels & saints. In every single photo I took, no matter what time of day, what the light was like or whether you took the photograph from inside or outside, the reflection of the walls of the old cathedral ruins is seen. When I researched this I found that it was no accident. The huge glass wall was designed to reflect each of the cathedrals from the other showing that each was incomplete without the other.Exterior Angels & Saints Window of New CathedralInterior of Angels & Saints Window of New CathedralI'm not really a fan of modern cathedrals but I have to say this one is impressive and very moving. Also I don't like taking photographs inside cathedrals, it feels irreverent (just one of my foibles) so I've used these from Wiki Commons. They are really good.High Altar and Graham Sutherland's TapestrySource: Wiki Commons Author Steve CadmanGraham Sutherland’s Tapestry - ‘Christ in Glory’                                      Source: Wiki Commons Author Steve Cadman This tapestry took 12 weavers in France 2 years to make.

I need to go back again & spend more time in this wonderful building. I have taken the Virtual Tour on the Coventry Cathedral website and realise how much more there is to see.This struck me as a very apt quotation for these cathedrals, a biblical inscription from Haggai 2:9 on the wall of the old cathedral. Next time I'll do a lot more reading from the websites below so that I don't miss anything.Coventry CathedralHistoric Coventry"},
{"title": "Inspector Montalbano", "date": "Saturday 4 August 2012", "text": "Well I found a great new detective series to read, Andrea Camilleri's Inspector Montalbano. Forget The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, Wallander & The Killing, this one is very different in fact it's pretty unique. I first came across Salvo Montalbano on BBC4 earlier this year when they broadcast ten TV programmes which were made in 1999. Not sure whether I missed the original showing or whether this is the first time they've screened it. Just hope they show them all again before they show the next programmes this autumn. I didn't get to see all of them so I'm reading the books & loving them. If they don't repeat the original ten programmes I might have to buy them on DVD.Salvo Montalbano's a flawed detective, like all the best ones but you can't help liking him. He's a loner, he's moody, pedantic, bad tempered but you know he's honest even if he changes things a little to get results. You wonder why he's such a moody bloke in the telly series, there's no monologue like in Harry O where we get to know what's going on in the character's mind. However if you read the books you get a better insight into his character. The other police characters are wonderful, my favourite is Catarella the desk sergeant whom Montalbano frequently finds unintelligible. I love the humour when Catarella is involved, what a comedy character & the actor who portrays him is exactly like the character in the book. The minor characters are also wonderful in these books & so too are those actors who portray them on TV. The setting is Sicily in a fictional town called Vigato (actually Ragusa) & the scenery is wonderful, not the pretty Portofino stuff but very attractive to watch. I'd love to visit the locations where series this was filmed. Maybe one of these days I'll get a holiday to Sicily & I'll look them up. There's a website Sicily Tour Guides which shows you where they were filmed. I do like the music too, it's very unusual, quite discordant & tinny but I found it really fitted the programme. I don't normally watch subtitled programmes, they irritate the life out of me but this one was different. I'm glad they didn't dub them as the original Italian is fantastic to listen to. Too often TV & films don't do justice to the books, one exception was Inspector Morse, Montalbano is another. I've a few more books to go in the series but I'm not rushing to get to the end. I'm dreading it! Will have to go right back to the beginning & start again!If you haven't seen it you can get a flavour of the series here.?Brush Quills! Oh I love that Catarella. You just couldn't dub that could you."},
{"title": "Well It's Finally Summer!", "date": "Saturday 28 July 2012", "text": "Hard to believe it's finally stopped raining & it's warmer. Guess what? I've got a cold! How in the world does that happen when I've gone all winter without one? Well never mind we've got our holiday tickets, we're off to Orlando with my daughter & family in 3 weeks. It's not really my kind of holiday, well I don't think it is but we decided to go with them. Now I know a lot of people have said it's fantastic & we'll love it but I'll reserve judgement until I've been. I met a lady who works in our Marks & Spencer cafe (I'm a regular there) who came back from Orlando in June. She said it rained for 3 weeks and was cold. I thought the USA was having a heatwave then but apparently they weren't in Orlando. How awful is that to spend a fortune on a holiday & the weather was no better than it was at home.Everybody has said how cheap it is there but have to say I don't believe them. The holiday alone isn't cheap never mind transport, then there's the food & the park tickets. Crumbs you need a mortgage to buy Disney tickets! Universal park tickets are much cheaper and to be honest that's really where my grandchildren want to go. Probably hard for people to believe but they aren't interested in Disney at all. They are Harry Potter daft but it seems stupid to go to Orlando & not go to the Disney parks. My husband isn't interested in any of the parks at all but he wants to see their reaction to Harry Potter's Wizarding World. We've been looking on YouTube at Olivander's Wand Shop where my granddaughter wants to go. She's determined to get picked to test a wand. They apparently let a group into the shop & choose a person to test a wand. Now one problem will be she's only seven & quite shy so I doubt she will get picked. I can see us going back every day for a fortnight to that blessed shop!The other problem will be when she discovers that the wand she gets isn't really magic. She already has one she got for Christmas but that one doesn't do real magic, only the wands from Olivander's shop do real magic apparently. Here's how she thinks it will work.Another disappointment will be when she doesn't see Daniel Radcliffe, (the actor who plays Harry Potter for those who are not fans). She is convinced he lives there and no matter how many times I tell her he's an actor & he doesn't live there, he lives in London, she just doesn't believe me. Me? I don't expect magic, I just want somewhere warm where I can relax, read and swim every day."},
{"title": "Back Again!", "date": "Friday 6 July 2012", "text": "I haven't been around for a while & I have no single reason or excuse for not blogging. It's a mixture of things which I won't bore you with. Think I'm feeling a bit more positive about life now and getting back to blogging even though it's changed a lot since I've been away.So what have I been up to? Well I decided to volunteer to help out at my granddaughter Lauren's primary school. They needed people to listen to children reading to help improve their reading skills. We got a little bit of training from the Local Education Department's Literacy Co-ordinator, a CRB (Criminal Records Bureau) check just to make sure we weren't perverts & off we went. Have to say I do enjoy it.I also volunteered to help DTP our local churches' weekly bulletin. Didn't realise it would take so much time but I suppose collating information from 3 churches isn't exactly a quick job.I have done quite a lot of reading over the past few months. I have picked up a few new authors I really like. Michael Dibden who wrote the Aurelio Zen books I posted about a while ago & Andrea Camilleri whose Inspector Montalbano books are a real treat. I got hooked on the TV series, BBC 4 showed a few of them earlier this year and I think they are going to show a few more later. They are a few years old and are sub titled but they still make wonderful viewing, absolute gems.My main obsession has been with knitting. I took up knitting lace shawls & got really hooked onto it. Often I knit when I really should be doing housework & feel a bit guilty about it. However I have a friend who always tells me that nobody on their deathbed ever said they should have done more housework! Well she was a teacher so I tell myself that's good advice.Our summer has been terrible so far, I can only remember two really warm & sunny days. Earlier this year the forecasters were complaining about the lack of rain for the past two years & were saying that we were going to have a serious drought. I wish they had kept quiet. It's a true saying about being careful about what you wish for because it's never stopped raining for months now. It's the coldest & wettest summer I can remember for years following the mildest and driest winter! Hard to tell what season it is, they all seem to be merging into one. I went for a swim tonight & honestly if it hadn't been so cold it would have saved time not bothering to get changed out of my bathing costume. I was wetter when I got into the car than when I got out of the pool! They spent a fortune putting a roof over the Centre Court at Wimbledon, it's already proved to be money well spent. If the rain doesn't stop the Olympics are in danger of being a total washout. Not that I'm going!Well to give myself a lift from the dire weather I've been looking back at some photos I took last summer when we had a really hot spell. I persuaded a very reluctant husband to go on a really cheap bus trip last July to The Cotswolds. I've never been there & wasn't ever likely to go as my husband hates going on any trips that involve driving. I'll probably post again about it as we visited some really lovely places. Thankfully we had fantastic weather and the photo above was taken in Boulton, a really pretty picture postcard village. The photo was taken from the road and that little stream runs through the bridge into someone's beautiful garden. Fancy having that to look at every day!"},
{"title": "Happy Christmas!", "date": "Saturday 24 December 2011", "text": "I haven't been around much for a while but I'd like to wish everyone a Happy Christmas and hope you all have a wonderful year in 2012.Sometimes telly isn't very inspiring, last year's Christmas output was dire. This year it's very different! We've already had the new drama series about the vet James Herriot and a new series of Garrow's Law. Tomorrow we're  spoilt for choice with the new Christmas Dr Who, Downton Abbey and Strictly Come Dancing Christmas programmes as well as the first of three new Absolutely Fabulous 20th anniversary specials. However they'll all be hard pushed to beat last night's very moving The Choir. It's an amazing programme about a group of wives whose husbands and partners were serving in Afghanistan who formed a military choir with the help of the inspirational choirmaster Gareth Malone.Have to say it was very moving listening to their stories about their husbands and their lives without them. The letters to their loved ones inspired Paul Mealor (the royal wedding composer) to write a song for them, Wherever You Are. They performed it live at the British Legion's Festival of Remembrance at the Albert Hall in November.  This week their record reached Number 1 and is the fastest selling single for six years. What a pleasant change from the X Factor hyped plastic songs produced over the last few years.I can't upload the video from YouTube but here's the link:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hR6O7VxKaQIf you can watch the BBC's iPlayer you can see the very moving programme here http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b0195vs2/The_Choir_Military_Wives_Compilation/"},

{"title": "Roseanna - Maj Sjowall and Per Wahloo", "date": "Sunday 18 September 2011", "text": "Roseanna - I saw this series recommended in a crime blog I subscribe to, The Rap Sheet. where I get a lot of good information about TV and film and ideas for reading material covering the crime genre. The series was described as one of the best crime series ever written. Well I had to take a look!Have to say I did enjoy this book, Roseanna, the first in the Martin Beck series, but it's not exactly easy to say why. The story was not particularly riveting and the tone and mood were rather bleak. However the writing was clear and succinct, the characters were interesting and I liked the dogged approach of Martin Beck, the Stockholm detective and main character.The authors Maj Sjowall and Per Wahloo were both Swedish journalists and communists; their books were apparently intended to be an assault on Swedish society.  The Sweden they describe in the novels isn't what my image of Sweden is like however I didn't feel that it affected my interest in the novels. The novels are set in the sixties, in the days before the police had access to the luxuries of our current forensic science and new technology. No genetic fingerprinting, no mobile phones and computers were in their infancy. Here we see basic policing methods and procedures. Maybe that was one of the reasons why I liked the book, it seemed real. Perhaps we've become sated with the CSI type programmes and action films and need to get back to this type of crime novel and programme. Apart from the low technology, the novels haven't dated that much, well mind you I noticed they did do a lot of smoking! What I particularly like is that in each of the books I've read so far, there has been a really interesting review which I have found very useful. I like seeing whether my impressions match other people's and maybe find something I've missed. I've read the next two books in the series, The Man Who Went Up in Smoke and The Man on the Balcony and I have to say I'm really enjoying them. I'm getting to know the characters now as a little more about them is revealed in each book. The books are getting darker and have something of the bleakness of the Wallander novels but I have to say I can't put the Martin Beck books down once I pick them up. Next in the series to read is The Laughing Policeman which I understand was made into a film in 1973 starring Walter Matthau and Bruce Dern. Apparently they moved the location to San Francisco for some reason. Not sure how that would work but I'll keep a look out for it!I started this post way back in March this year! However I've been very poor at blogging in recent months but I have been reading and knitting a lot and that's my excuse. Well I've sadly reached the end of the books in this series that I can read as the library just doesn't have any more. It's so disappointing but I'll keep a lookout in the charity shops as I did like this series.  If you haven't come across this series and you like crime/police/detective stories they are well worth reading. I'm disappointed but never mind I moved onto Michael Dibdin's Zen series prompted by the telly adaptations which I really enjoyed and posted about.  They have definitely filled the gap!"},
{"title": "Not Before Time!", "date": "Wednesday 13 July 2011", "text": "I don't usually write much political stuff and to be honest this isn't really political with a capital P.  However for the past week it has seemed like someone had opened Pandora's Box with the news of the disgusting activities of the News of the World and News International which have dominated the news and every day seemed to get worse.The public didn't really have much sympathy with celebrities like Hugh Grant & Sienna Miller whose phones had been hacked but when it came to Millie Dowler, the teenager who had been so brutally murdered it was a whole different ball game.  We'd already seen the agony her family went through as they gave evidence in the trial.  What kind of person hacks into a missing teenager's phone and deletes messages giving the parents & police hope that she was still alive and doing it herself?  Well it's the type of person who is employed by the gutter press apparently.  However it seems that is just the tip of the iceberg! It looks like they've left no stone unturned with politicians, royalty, widows of soldiers killed in Afghanistan, victims of terrorist attacks, murdered children's families, all are possible victims of phone hacking.  Anything is justified apparently to get a story for their newspapers.  Well it looks like finally Rupert Murdoch is getting some come uppance in relation to his media empire.  His News Corporation has today announced that it is dropping its planned bid to take full ownership of satellite broadcaster BSkyB. The announcement came as the House of Commons prepared to vote for a motion supported by all major party leaders calling on Mr Murdoch to scrap the bid.  For once all the politicians were in agreement.  Finally News International is being taken to task for its disgusting activities which have been going on for years.  The whole thing leaves a nasty taste in your mouth as politicians don't come out of it squeaky clean either despite their loud protestations against the News of the World's activities.  David Cameron was pretty cosy with News International as he courted their support before the election.  He's distancing himself now though. In addition his ability to employ decent staff comes into question.  He employed Andy Coulson as his communications chief, yes the ex-editor of the News of the World at the time of the jailing of employees of News of the World for intercepting voicemails.  Gordon Brown, ex- PM has accused News International of targetting him and attempting to access his voicemail, bank accounts and his family's medical records. Disgusting but why hadn't he made this public earlier.  Looks like politicians have all kept quiet.Police too are coming in for some stick. It's alleged that a police officer offered to sell News of the World details of the royal family and their staff.  Then there's the issue of the Met where the Assistant Commissioner John Yates assessed the first inquiry into the practice of phone hacking in 2009.  He decided that they couldn't take it any further.  Now he's blaming the News of the World for failing to co-operate with the police.  Mmmmmm!You have to wonder whether the unethical and illegal activities of this organisation are limited to the UK.  Surely it would be unusual if they were limited to one part of this global corporation.  Now the police are going to look into the possibility that phones were hacked in the USA following the terrorist attack on the World Trade Centre.  Nothing would surprise me now.So we're going to get a public inquiry into media regulation (what regulation?) and phone hacking.  Well I won't hold my breath!Meanwhile the best news so far in this whole sorry story is that thankfully Rupert has withdrawn his bid to totally takeover BSkyB!  Have to say I've never subscribed to BSkyB because Murdoch owns 39% of it.  Now if he relinquishes that, I might just consider taking out a subscription!"},
{"title": "Cloud Atlas", "date": "Thursday 9 June 2011", "text": "When I go on holiday I tend to buy fairly cheap books that I can just leave behind and reduce my luggage weight. Cloud Atlas was one that didn’t turn out to be the usual holiday, poolside, easy read. I found it a fairly difficult book to read but I persevered and it was well worth the effort.It was hard to get used to the first part of the book which was told in diary style and in old English language. I was tempted to give up but just as I got to grips with it and started to get really interested in the characters, the story ended mid sentence and the next page was a different story! I thought I’d bought a book with pages missing. Well it was very cheap! I checked and there was no list of chapters so I had to flick through the book to look at the sections. I found that it was actually six stories and that this one would pick up later in the book, so I persevered.All the stories are told in different styles, structures, language and grammar. All include a range of characters in varying times and places each having some connection to the others.  Structurally it is unusual as five of the stories are split into two sections and are told in chronological order. The sixth is told in one single reading. The other five are then completed in reverse order ending with the first one. Yes, confusing!The first is set in the mid 19th century on a ship in the Pacific and is told by an American notary in diary style. The second is set between the First and Second World Wars in Belgium and is a series of letters from a musician to his first love. The third is a thriller style story set in 1970s California about a journalist trying to uncover big business corruption.  The fourth is my favourite, The Ghastly Ordeal of Timothy Cavendish which is set in modern day Britain. Timothy Cavendish, an aging publisher, is in debt and trying to flee from thugs. He ends up incarcerated in a Draconian old people’s care home with some really funny dialogue and situations. The fifth story is set in Korea with a clone bred for service in a fast food chain being interviewed prior to her execution. The sixth story is told completely and is set in post apocalyptic Hawaii. I found this pretty savage and the most difficult to follow due to the language style. It's reminiscent of Huckleberry Finn but certainly not a light read.  After this the author then returns to complete the five stories going back in time to the first. Confused? Well so was I for a while.I suppose the main theme of all the stories is about power and the tendency of the strong to oppress the poor or weaker. It also concerns greed, prejudice, slavery, environmental issues and friendship. There are some very depressing sections about man’s inhumanity to their fellow man and woman but there are also some hilarious sections. This book is no easy read but it’s cleverly constructed, very well written, thought provoking and I have to say I did enjoy it. The mark of a good book for me is one I learn something from and makes me really think. This book certainly meets those criteria and I brought it home with me. I’ll definitely read it again!"},
{"title": "I'm Definitely Losing It!", "date": "Monday 9 May 2011", "text": "There are some days I think I’m doing OK then others when I know I’m losing the plot.  Today was one of the losing the plot days.I decided I needed to increase my level of activity from one or two swims a week to at least three.  Doctors nowadays are daft about giving you tablets to keep your cholesterol and blood pressure levels low, well that came from the government!  The downside is that it’s proving hard for people to get travel insurance once they start you on the tablets.  It’s a mad world as those taking the tablets with the low blood pressure and cholesterol have got to be a safer bet to insure than those who don’t bother but it doesn’t work like that.Today was the day I started to increase the swimming.  I also thought I’d try out my new swimming costume that I bought last week.  The one I currently use is two years old and has lasted amazingly well considering how many times it has been worn.  I think it’s a combination of less chemicals in the new swimming pools, think they use bio-filters and also the new chlorine resistant fabrics which some swimming costume manufacturers use.  I’ve been expecting my current costume to give up the ghost for a while and been looking for a new one.  Don't want it to disintegrate on holiday!  It’s taken a while as I’m a bit picky.  I have to say, I don’t like them too loose or after they get wet you look like a saggy sack of potatoes.  I’ve made that mistake a couple of times and bought bathers that fitted comfortably only for a couple of swims.  Now I know I need to buy them a little bit tight as they do give a little.  So I thought I’d test out my new bather today and grabbed it as I went out to swim.  It felt really great for swimming not too tight, very comfortable and definitely not saggy!  I finished the swim came out had a shower and went to get changed.  As I took off the bather I noticed the little thin plastic ring that they attach the manufacturer’s tags to the costume with.  It was still attached to one of the straps!  Had a little giggle to myself as I thought thank goodness I hadn’t left the tags on.  That would have been horrendous as Zoggs (costume manufacturer) attach four fairly large oval tags to their goods.  One tells you about the chlorine resistant fabric they use, the second tells you what size, style and colour it is and their Swim4 Fitness programme, the third tells you the leg height of the bather (most important) and the last has the Zoggs logo and website information.  Now just imagine all that that stuff flapping about on your back as you swim and you can’t see it.  I kept on smiling about it as I got ready thinking I’d hardly dare show my face again if I’d left them on.  People would be thinking what an old nutter she is, can’t even take the tags off her bather!As I bent down to put on my shoes I stopped smiling.  This is what I saw on the floor. Yes, four soggy Zoggs tags.  Argh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Not sure I dare go back!"},
{"title": "Ratking - Michael Dibdin", "date": "Sunday 3 April 2011", "text": "I watched the TV series Zen earlier this year and really enjoyed it.  My posting The Books of Zen described it and I have eventually managed to get some of Michael Dibdin's books out of the library and Ratking is the first in the eleven book series.I thoroughly enjoyed this book even though the characters and story bear little resemblance to the BBC TV series.  They are both very good in their own right.This first book of the series introduces Aurelio Zen, the Venetian detective who has been demoted to a desk job in the Ministry of Interior in Rome, following his working involvement in the Aldo Moro kidnapping and murder in 1978.  Someone had to carry the can and it was Zen! Now a married but separated fifty - something, he lives with his elderly mother in Rome and works as a Ministry snooper making trips to provincial capitals and typing up reports.When a rich and powerful businessman is kidnapped and after over four months hasn’t been found, “they” need “someone” to investigate as a gesture.  Eventually they think of Zen!  All the while Zen has to watch his back and keep out of trouble. Have to say the story kept me guessing until the end as the culprit wasn’t the same one as in the telly programme!This is no ordinary detective story, it is very well written.  There is great humour, political comment, descriptive passages about the beauty of Italy and its cities as well as wonderful characters often typifying the different parts of Italy.  Although you have to bear in mind that the book was published in 1988 so things have probably changed a bit since then!A mark of a good book for me is one that not only entertains me but makes me feel something about the characters and the setting.  It’s an added bonus if I learn something from it.  I certainly enjoyed this book, loved the characters and I felt as though I learned a lot about Italy and its people as well as its problems.  Have to say I particularly liked the humour and the way it is woven into informing us about Italy’s peoples.  Zen and his mother are from Venice, the North and they are now living in Rome, the South!  (Obviously the North South divide is not peculiar to the UK!)   Well I remember learning about the Re-Unification of Italy in the Nineteenth and early Twentieth Centuries in our history lessons but I hadn’t really thought about the implications of this before, that these cities were independent until then and now Rome rules!  There are a few really humorous conversations about this divide which I loved.  Here’s an example from the beginning of the book where Zen, a Veronese and a Roman are stuck on a train due to an unofficial stoppage.  Zen is listening whilst the Roman and the Veronese are arguing about the state of the country which the Veronese thinks is in chaos:         ….there are worse things than chaos.”  (The Roman) “What might they be?” (The Veronese)  “Too much order.”The Veronese made a contemptuously dismissive gesture.“Too much order? Don’t make me laugh. In this country too much order wouldn’t even be enough.  It’s always the same.  The trains are late?  Build a new railway!  The South is poor?  Open a new factory!  The young are illiterate?  Hire more teachers!  There are too many civil servants?  Retire them on big pensions!  The crime rate is soaring?  Pass new laws!  But for the love of God don’t expect us to make the railways or factories we have run efficiently, or make the teachers or bureaucrats do an honest day’s work, or make people respect the existing laws.  Oh no!  Because that would smack of dictatorship or tyranny, and we can’t have that!”The conversation goes on comparing the North and South to order and chaos and all the while Zen is sitting thinking that although he's a Northerner, he doesn’t want to live in an ordered Northern land where everything runs like clockwork.  Life’s not about that, it’s about ordinary working people like the two working class lads in the corridor who have energy, drive and flair.  Then the two lads come into the carriage and proceed to rob them.  Brilliant!STOP PRESS!!!I've just read that the BBC in their wisdom????? have not commissioned a second series of Zen. How stupid can they be?  It had very good reviews and pretty successful Sunday night viewing figures. Crumbs what on earth will we be watching in future on Sundays.  At the moment it's Antiques Roadshow which isn't exactly Sunday night viewing, followed by Waking the Dead. Now I do like Waking the Dead but this is the last series!  So come on BBC get your act together!There's a backlash against the decision and you can post a comment to indicate your support here.  They may have a change of heart.  After all ITV did with Foyle's War when enough fans complained. Otherwise we'll just have to hope some other channel has the good sense to pick it up."},

{"title": "Take That and Fake That - Comic Relief", "date": "Sunday 20 March 2011", "text": "The BBC have uploaded the Take That Comic Relief video. I loved this take off cleverly based on Take That's earlier videos. Love the song too!Laughed myself silly at these five brilliant comedians, David Walliams, Catherine Tate, James Corden, Alan Carr and John Bishop. They enjoyed every minute too from what I saw on the full video which I downloaded from iTunes for only £1.89. Worth every penny! I see the live version of Take That and Happy Now is on You Tube. So if you want to see the real thing it's here. Funny now they're not calling them \"Take That and Robbie Williams\". Wonder if it's working better than everyone thought and he's back for good! Pardon the pun Take That fans!"},
{"title": "It's Comic Relief Again!", "date": "Saturday 19 March 2011", "text": "Seems to come around so fast and yet it's only every other year that the UK goes a bit daft to raise money for Comic Relief.I bought red noses for the grandchildren to take to school and a large plastic one for the grille at the front of the car. I love to see them when you're driving along. I was going to leave it on for a while but I read they can be a hazard if they come loose. Also had to bake brownies for Lauren to take to school to sell today. The children really enjoy the whole thing, baking the cakes, selling them then eating them. Not exactly healthy but it's only every two years. She came back from school saying some of the children were disappointed because they didn't get one, they sold very quickly. So we'll be baking more for her to give them on Tuesday. No rest for the wicked is there.Another thing I enjoy about Red Nose Day is the fact that the telly is much better on these nights when like Children in Need, the show totally takes over the BBC. You get some really good music and lots of funny sketches. I suppose the most important aspect is raising awareness about how the money they raise goes to help vulnerable people. The film clips of Africa are heartbreaking.Despite all the economic problems people are still being so generous with their time and money. Makes you think the world isn't such a bad place after all the terrible things we've been seeing in recent weeks. People still care about each other.I really enjoyed a lot of the music tonight but this year they haven't made all the videos available on You Tube. You have to buy them on iTunes which I suppose raises more cash for them. One of the funniest sketches was of James Corden (Smithy from Gavin and Stacey) trying to help create order in the planning meeting for this year's Comic Relief. The cast for the sketch was amazing, George Michael, JLS, Gordon Brown, Keira Knightley, Rio Ferdinad, Ron Weasley and Malfoy from the Harry Potter films, Sir Seb Coe, Ringo Starr, Paul McCartney, Tom Daley and even Justin Bieber playing the keyboard! This is available on iTunes so might have to get it to have another good laugh at it. George Michael was really good when Smithy was taking the mickey out of him!UPDATE = Just bought the Smithy 11 from iTunes and it has loads of stuff on. It is now available on You Tube, just watched it again and George Michael is brilliant!If you're a fan of Downton Abbey and Upstairs Downstairs you might enjoy this spoof with a host of stars including Kim Cattrell, Victoria Wood, Jennifer Saunders, Harry Enfield, Joanna Lumley to name but a few. This one is available on You Tube:Part One Part TwoShame the Take That and the Fake That spoof videos have to be bought, I really enjoyed them. However it's all in a good cause.Also loved Miranda Hart and Patricia Hodge dancing with JLS. Brilliant! Not winning X Factor hasn't done them any harm. Oops that's a double negative I think! They seem to be more popular than Alexandra Burke who apparently won. It's not a programme I watch!They seem to be raising a phenomenal amount of money tonight, so best of British to them!If you can access BBC iPlayer you can see most of the programme here now."},
{"title": "The Reader", "date": "Sunday 6 March 2011", "text": "The Reader - Bernhard SchlinkThe Reader was chosen as the Bloggers' Book Club book for February. So here's my review:I was very disappointed with this book, after all it had such great reviews and recommendations. I enjoyed the first three chapters, the prose was simple but it created very vivid pictures as Michael Berg relates the story of his illness and first meetings with Hanna. It was downhill all the way after that!The style of the book changes in second part where it becomes a much more philosophical read, maybe reflecting Michael's move from childhood to an adult in the second part. We see Hanna being tried for war crimes, Michael observing the trial and eventually the move towards Hanna's release. The theme of collective guilt over the Holocaust and how the different generations in Germany deal with it is covered by Michael.For me the main reason I didn't like the book was, I couldn’t feel any empathy whatsoever with either of the two main characters. From what we learn about them, I felt they were cold, unemotional, selfish and detached. Michael, for example hardly mentions his mother, his wife and his daughter, the other women in his life.The novel raises questions but I never felt there were any answers. Well to be honest, how can there be any answers to such a horrendous theme as the Holocaust, national and individual guilt. However there were other questions which remained unanswered and these were in the author’s power to resolve, but for some reason he didn’t. Hanna’s so called secret wasn’t difficult to guess right from their early meetings. However for Hanna’s final action, no answer was given or even hinted at.The book evoked no real emotion from me other than frustration. It really should have done, given the fact that it was dealing with horrific war crimes. No tears, no sadness, no joy, no smiles. I kept waiting for answers which never materialised. I also felt I didn’t learn anything from this book which I feel is such a waste."},
{"title": "Elsa - The Lion That Changed the World!", "date": "Wednesday 2 February 2011", "text": "George Adamson - source Wiki CommonsLast night I watched the Natural World wildlife documentary which told the true story of Elsa, the orphaned lioness featured in Joy Adamson’s book Born Free, later made into an amazing film. The programme continued where the film left off and included contributions from some of the people who worked with Joy and George Adamson as they fought to return Elsa to living wild and later with other lions from the film and the famous lion, Christian. Tragically both Joy and George Adamson were murdered in their beloved Kenya but not by wild animals, by people.The true story was not the idyllic one told in the book, the Adamson’s relationship was a volatile one as David Attenborough recounted in the programme. He also told of how he woke up in a tent one morning with a huge lion lying on his chest, that was his introduction to Elsa!  Not only was the Adamsons' relationship a difficult one, the making of the film was not an easy one either as Virginia McKenna who played Joy Adamson in the film recounted. Her emotions were apparent as she returned to Maru, Kenya where she and her husband Bill Travers met George and Joy Adamson. She is the sole survivor of the two couples.The film sparked a massive global interest in conservation and a love of wild animals where once we only feared them. It also changed the lives of the stars of the film, Bill Travers and his wife Virginia McKenna forever. They became firm friends of the Adamsons, especially George, and then went on to become campaigning conservationists who set up the Born Free Foundation . The Foundation works throughout the world to stop individual wild animal suffering and to protect threatened species in the wild.  I'll be buying Christmas cards from there this year. Yes, Elsa really did make a huge difference!Fifty years ago when the Adamsons were returning Elsa to the wild lions were not under threat. With the increasing population in Africa their territories have reduced and the additional problem of poachers has sadly reduced the population of lions living free in Kenya to 1,000.If you missed the programme it’s still available on BBC iPlayer It's an absolute gem!If you can't watch the programme on iPlayer you can see some lovely video clips on the George Adamson Father of Lions website . It also has some wonderful photographs of all the lions including Elsa and George's favourite, Boy, one of the lions in the film Born Free. I’m not ashamed to admit I blubbered most of the way through the programme, especially when they showed original footage of Elsa with the Adamsons and later clips from the film. Born Free had an amazing soundtrack with wonderful music composed by John Barry who sadly died this week. I just have to hear this and I fill up! Here's a clip from Born Free, it's over forty years old and still better than most of the films being produced today!"},
{"title": "The Books of Zen!", "date": "Monday 17 January 2011", "text": "No this is not a post about Buddhism! Rufus SewellI have a new telly favourite, Zen! Episode 1 aired a couple of weeks ago and I thought it was quite good. After episode 2, I thought, well I really like this. Episode 3, the last one aired last night and now I'm hooked. I loved it!I tried to figure out why I liked it so much and had to conclude that it was just different to a lot of the crime stuff that we're offered today. A breath of fresh air.Rufus Sewell is great as Aurelio Zen, the divorced, Venetian, suave, sophisticated and honest, detective who lives with his mother. None of your shouting and swearing from Zen, if anything he underplays the role which works brilliantly.The length of the episodes is just right at one and a half hours and allows the story to be told without that rushing to complete it in less than an hour like many crime programmes nowadays. This amount of time lets you get to know the characters which I think really does help. No ads too on the BBC so you really get your moneys worth! The approach to the casting and script is very quirky. All actors are English and speak with a range of English accents. Zen greets his mother with “Caio Mamma” then in his slightly Cockney accent (well sounds that way to a Northerner) asks “What time is supper”? The only actors without English accents are his girlfriend, played by the beautiful Caterina Murino who looks a little like Sophia Loren, and his mother. They do a lot of that continental double cheek kissing too.The Italian scenery is gorgeous, it really was filmed in Rome. The parks, churches, cafes, restaurants and apartments really make a delightful change from what we usually see nowadays. Zen himself wanders about in wonderfully cut suits; he would have made an amazing James Bond!I do like the dry sense of humour too and last night's episode really had me laughing out loud. I won’t say why, that would spoil it.Just have to hope the series proves popular so we get to see more of Zen. Have to say it’s one of the best programmes I’ve seen in a long while, Well worth the cost, whatever it was.I must try to get hold of some of Michael Dibdin's books to see how the adaptations compare. From what I've read Zen was a bit older in the books and not quite so cool and laid back. Well there are eleven books so plenty of material for more episodes.If you missed Zen and can use the BBCs iPlayer I’d recommend you give it a try although you won’t get the benefit of that Roman scenery on a computer. If you can’t access iPlayer you can get a brief flavour on YouTube here, although not a lot of the lovely scenery. A bit of graffiti, a bit of a cafe and a lot of kissing!Post 171"},
{"title": "Able Seacat Simon, D.M., R.N. (1947-1949)", "date": "Sunday 28 November 2010", "text": "A little while ago I wrote a posting in memory of Able Seacat Simon of HMS Amethyst, the cat who was born on Stonecutters Island Hong Kong and was adopted by the crew of HMS Amethyst. He was a wonderful support to the crew when HMS Amethyst became involved in the Yangtse Incident and eventually was awarded the Dickin Medal, the animal award for gallantry, often referred to as the \"Animals' Victoria Cross\". I won’t repeat the information here but if you want to read the heart warming story of Simon take a look here. As I reported Simon was buried in Plot 281 of the PDSA's (People’s Dispensary for Sick Animals) animal cemetery at Ilford, east of London.Recently I had a lovely email from Bob William Green who had seen the posting and was contacting me to thank me for keeping Simon’s memory alive through the posting. Bob reminded me that today, 28th November 2010, is the 61st anniversary of Simon’s passing so I thought it was timely to update the information. Bob told me that Lt Commander Stewart Hett was\"Number One\" Officer on HMS Amethyst and present on the bridge during the entire escape down the Yangtse.\"Had he not have taken the picture of Simon's Grave in November 2007 at the rededication of the Cemetery, also published on the Maritime Quest website, I would have never come out of the shadows to tell my story. It serves to reinforce the value of companionship of an animal in a family.\"Bob also told me that it’s believed that he is the only surviving civilian who met Simon in 1949; he was eight years old at the time. You can see some lovely photographs of Simon, the crew of the ship and Lt Commander Stewart Hett at Simon's grave on the Maritime Quest website. There's also a very moving tribute from Bob. Bob’s granddad who was in the Royal Navy during the First World War was instrumental in bringing about Bob’s contact with Simon, he was also responsible for the ships' mascots during his own time in the service. His cat \"Ordinary Seacat Togo\" is also recorded on this site.The Maritime Quest website Bob told me about is an interesting one, recording a photographic history of the world’s great ships. I’ve had a look and it’s a site I’ll be coming back to. My Dad was in the Royal Navy during World War 2 so I’d like to see if there are any of the ships he sailed on.  I'm very grateful to Bob for getting in touch, it was very kind of him to give me some more information about this wonderful little cat and the people who loved him. As he said:\"So many of stories from the past disappear with the passage of time, I believe it is up to us, those who remember or had contact with these things, to try to perpetuate them for the enrichment of the future generations. Such stories will never be told again.\"Post 170"},

{"title": "Calling All Crime Fans", "date": "Tuesday 5 October 2010", "text": "Now who is your favourite TV detective? Want to vote for them?Well this is not a totally open contest, there are only detectives from UK TV programmes to vote for as it's the ITV3 People's Detective Award.I found it hard to choose as I like nearly all of them. I seem to watch more crime programmes than anything else at the moment. There's been a great season of programmes looking at the characteristics of the detectives and followed by an episode which I've thoroughly enjoyed. Yes, they're all repeats but better than most of the new programmes we're presented with at the moment.As I said it was a hard choice as there are these great characters to select from:Tom Barnaby - Midsommer MurdersChristopher Foyle - Foyle's WarJack Frost - A Touch of FrostSherlock Holmes - Sherlock Robbie Lewis - LewisJane Marple - MarpleEndeavour Morse - Inspector Morse Hercule Poirot - PoirotJohn Rebus - RebusJane Tennison - Prime SuspectReg Wexford - WexfordCharles Wycliffe - WycliffeTo be honest I think Inspector Morse is probably the best TV detective programme ever made, but he's not my favourite detective and although I do really like it, it's not my favourite programme. I whittled my choices down to Lewis and Foyle but eventually I chose Christopher Foyle. I love the setting during World War 2 giving you an insight into the daily life of people during the war. Well the life of some people, it was set in Hastings, Sussex so it would have been very different to life in London or other big cities which were heavily bombed. Most of all I love the quiet, intelligent and totally honest character of Christopher Foyle, played so brilliantly by Michael Kitchen. The supporting cast is great too, Honeysuckle Weeks as Sam and Anthony Howell as Sergeant Milner. What is interesting is how popular the series was and yet ITV cancelled it. Well TV people aren't always the best at making these decisions are they. Look at the loonies in the US who cancelled Harry O for Charlie's Angels but that's another story. Even though it had a good audience which had never dropped, (the final programme was watched by 7.3 million viewers) ITV cancelled it. Partly for economic reasons and partly an attempt to attract the \"yoof\" audience. However the fans reacted and wrote to the press to complain and it was reinstated. You can read about it here in the Daily Telegraph's interview with the writer of Foyle's War,  Anthony Horowitz.Foyles War - Daily TelegraphIf you want to vote or find out more about the all the detectives take a look at the Specsavers Crime Thrillers Season   You have until Friday 8 October.Now will someone tell me whether there's an equivalent award for US TV detectives.

Most of them just get on my nerves with their flying cars, stupid mobile phone ads and washing powders that don't get your clothes any whiter or cleaner than the cheapest stuff on the market.They interrupt the programmes but at least you can go for a loo break or make a cuppa!  One thing the BBC has in its favour is no adverts. Well only the ones advertising their programmes! I can remember the first time I ever saw a TV advert, it was in a Jerry Lewis film. Yes I'm ancient and remember the golden time when we had no adverts on telly. It made me laugh as I'd never seen anything like it. There was this old woman watching a huge colour telly and as each product advert came onto the screen she started using it. As I said I laughed, it was so stupid. The only thing I can remember about the products was one turned her hair bright pink. No wonder I don't believe in TV ads. I had started to write a posting on telly adverts when they started to show the new one about Harvey last week which shows the power of TV advertising.

{"title": "Please Release Me!", "date": "Tuesday 3 August 2010", "text": "Harry ODo you remember Harry O?I do. He's my all time favourite TV detective. Harry O was a classic American crime drama television series that aired for two seasons from 1974 to 1976.The series starred David Janssen as Harry Orwell, a private detective living on the beach in a cottage near San Diego. He had been a San Diego policeman until he was shot in the back and forced into retirement.Harry O is probably the best American TV crime drama of the past thirty years and the character Harry O was without a doubt one of the most compelling. It was very likely one of David Janssen’s best performances.The series had brilliant scripts, written by Howard Rodman who created the series. They were full of humour, wit and often melancholy. The cinematography was unusual and elegant, more typical of film than TV. Harry was a well rounded character, bohemian, complex, vulnerable and memorably portrayed by David Janssen. His voiceovers were a significant part of the early shows where he philosophised about his life. Remember? Days happen to you... and sometimes I wish I could go back to when I was 17 again. When I was 17, I once said, “A woman is like a bus -- let her go. There’ll be another one along in five minutes.”  But that was a long time ago...Take a trip down memory lane, listen to the great theme tune and watch a clip of David Janssen's wonderful portrayal of Harry O in part of an early programme in the first series, Gertrude. The quality isn't brilliant but it's OK.  Oh how I love those voiceovers!I remember watching this on the BBC on Saturday evenings. It was very popular in the UK possibly because Harry O was more like the kind of TV detective we tend to prefer. Flawed, vulnerable and with a good heart! The locations in San Diego and then later in Los Angeles were a bit different for us too.Unfortunately the series was axed after only two seasons as the demand for more violent TV programmes increased and Universal Studios who produced it went along with that.Sadly it has never been released on DVD. Currently Warner Brothers holds the rights and has no plans to do so. There are numerous scam websites taking money for Harry O DVDs that don’t materialise and others that sell low quality materials produced from TV showings, so don't fall for the scams. So many other TV programmes of this genre, yet nowhere near the quality, have been released, but this one has not.I have to say I'd love to see this series again and so I created a petition to send to Warner Brothers who seem reluctant to release it.If you remember the series and would like to support this petition please sign it.

{"title": "A Bad Week in January", "date": "Friday 30 July 2010", "text": "It started as a bad week in January and it kept me from blogging for quite a while.  On the Sunday, our little old cat Tuppence started to have serious problems with her heart and although I didn’t realise it at the time her joints were giving her trouble too.  As if that wasn’t bad enough two days later my husband was diagnosed with cancer of the oesophagus (gullet).  It has been a difficult few months and thankfully Eric has recovered but sadly little Tuppence didn’t.  It was heartbreaking letting her go, but it was the best thing for her. I started to wonder whether we were ever going to get back to a normal life. I won’t go into the details of my husband’s treatment, all I’ll say is that it’s been fantastic and thankfully, successful. Well as successful as things can ever be when you've had cancer. There are no guarantees. Our National Health Service comes in for criticism but I have to say it's amazing. The speed at which my husband was treated and the quality of treatment and care was phenomenal. I dread to think how much it must have cost. The care has continued with our local community nurses who came out every day after he was discharged.  If we were relying on private medical insurance, I doubt if we would be able to get it for him. If we could, we wouldn’t be able to afford it. It’s already a nightmare getting his travel insurance. I try not to be too Political (with a capital P) when I blog. However I hope the Conservative government invests as much in the NHS as the previous Labour government has done. The Conservative track record on the NHS isn't good. Margaret Thatcher and co. decimated it by massive underfunding. The NHS is one of Britain's greatest achievements and it’s our country's most most priceless asset! So politics over, now to the information bit of the posting. Check this out and be aware of the dangers of oesophageal cancer as very few people know much about it.We hadn't heard anything about cancer of the oesophagus before January and although it's not common, it's the seventh most common of the cancers in the UK with 7,000 new cases every year. We were surprised to find that it's on the increase worldwide. Apparently the North East of England and Scotland have the highest incidence of this type of cancer in Europe.There are two different types of cancer of the oesophagus, adenocarcinoma and squamous. I won't go into detail here, you can find out more on the Patient UK website.What causes Oesophageal Cancer?Apparently there are various causes of cancer of the oesophagus:Ageing! It's more common in people over 65 and in men. Diet is a possible factor. A high fat diet and obesity are thought to increase the risk and a vegetable and fruit rich diet is thought to reduce it. Smoking. Drinking a lot of alcohol especially spirits. Acid reflux. Food and drink temperatures. Some research has shown that high temperatures could be a factor. China and the Far East has a higher incidence than Europe. This could be due to environmental factors and/or diet. If you want to find out more about the causes check out Cancer Research UK. So what are the symptoms?Well unfortunately there are no early symptoms for this type of cancer.  Sadly most cases are advanced before they are diagnosed. The most common symptom is difficulty swallowing and feeling that your food is getting stuck in your throat. Less common symptoms are persistent hiccups, coughing, weight loss, indigestion and vomiting.Eric was one of the few people diagnosed through a total fluke. His symptoms hadn't been any of those listed but our local doctor sent him for an endoscopy to try to find out what exactly was wrong. This detected a minute tumour which was then found to be cancerous but thankfully it was diagnosed very early. He had his operation (very drastic) but didn't need any further treatment. It's been a slow recovery for him and he still has quite a long way to go, but he has a very positive attitude which certainly helps. It goes to show that you should always get checked when your symptoms are persistent.As for me, I'm just starting to relax and get my life back on track. Well I was this week and now we have the school holidays and grandchildren. No rest for the wicked!Post 161"},

{"title": "Ridiculous Complaints Made by British Holidaymakers", "date": "Wednesday 21 July 2010", "text": "Often when you’re on holiday, you hear people making daft comments/complaints about the hotel, food, staff etc.  Obviously I only hear the English comments, aside from English,  I only speak a smattering of Spanish so I have no idea what the French, German, Russian holidaymakers say about the place. Our reputation is one of a nation of moaners and I sometimes think they’re right.A couple of years ago in a Greek hotel we've stayed at for a number of years, one particular English family complained about the food.  Believe me the food was amazing. At lunch there were two restaurants serving lots of different dishes, meat, fish, pasta, vegetables, salad etc. There were, Chinese buffet two evenings, French & Greek a la carte two evenings, Italian & Greek buffets the other evenings and there was a fantastic choice of all types of hot and cold food.  My daughter and I don’t eat meat yet we never have a problem finding lovely food.  Well this family complained about the food and asked to eat in the Chinese restaurant every night.  They said that all they had to eat was pizza and chips for two weeks. What a load of rubbish!  I don’t know where they had been eating but it certainly wasn’t at the hotel.  They even commented on Trip Advisor that they had never been so pleased to see a McDonalds.  What a shower!I read about the “Twenty Most Ridiculous Complaints Made by Holidaymakers” on the Daily Telegraph website today and maybe they were not the most stupid tourists after all. These complaints were taken from research by Thomas Cook and ABTA.Here they are in all their stupidity:\"We booked an excursion to a water park but no-one told us we had to bring our swimming costumes and towels.\" A tourist at a top African game lodge overlooking a waterhole, who spotted a visibly aroused elephant, complained that the sight of this rampant beast ruined his honeymoon by making him feel \"inadequate\". \"On my holiday to Goa in India, I was disgusted to find that almost every restaurant served curry. I don't like spicy food at all.\" \"It's lazy of the local shopkeepers to close in the afternoons.  I often needed to buy things during 'siesta' time - this should be banned.\" \"I think it should be explained in the brochure that the local store does not sell proper biscuits like custard creams or ginger nuts.\"\"I was bitten by a mosquito - no-one said they could bite.\"\"It is your duty as a tour operator to advise us of noisy or unruly guests before we travel.\"\"We had to queue outside with no air conditioning.\" \"We found the sand was not like the sand in the brochure. Your brochure shows the sand as yellow but it was white.\"\"There are too many Spanish people. The receptionist speaks Spanish. The food is Spanish. Too many foreigners.\" \"The brochure stated: 'No hairdressers at the accommodation'. We're trainee hairdressers - will we be OK staying here?\"\"I compared the size of our one-bedroom apartment to our friends' three-bedroom apartment and ours was significantly smaller.\"\"My fiancé and I booked a twin-bedded room but we were placed in a double-bedded room. We now hold you responsible for the fact that I find myself pregnant. This would not have happened if you had put us in the room that we booked.\" \"It took us nine hours to fly home from Jamaica to England it only took the Americans three hours to get home.\" \"No-one told us there would be fish in the sea. The children were startled.\"\"We bought 'Ray-Ban' sunglasses for five euros (£3.50) from a street trader, only to find out they were fake.\"\"Topless sunbathing on the beach should be banned. The holiday was ruined as my husband spent all day looking at other women.\"A guest at a Novotel in Australia complained his soup was too thick and strong. He was inadvertently slurping the gravy at the time. \"The beach was too sandy.\" A woman threatened to call police after claiming that she’d been locked in by staff. When in fact, she had mistaken the “do not disturb” sign on the back of the door as a warning to remain in the room.I wonder whether people from other countries are as daft as this! You start to think that maybe everyone should take an IQ test when they apply for a passport. Well as my Mam used to say “Some folks are just not safe to be let out!”Post 159"},

{"title": "Let the Great World Spin - Colum McCann - Book Review", "date": "Wednesday 16 June 2010", "text": "My rating: 1 of 5 starsSet in the late summer of 1974, Colum McCann’s novel is the story of lives that touch and the centre of the story is Petit’s high wire walk between the Twin Towers of the World Trade Centre. The character’s seemingly disparate stories are interwoven around that walk. There’s Corrigan the Irish monk who lives among prostitutes and drug dealers in the Bronx and his brother Ciaran who comes to visit and struggles to understand his younger brother and what motivates him. Have to say I couldn’t understand either of them. There are the prostitutes Jazzlyn and her mother, Tillie, struggling to survive in a world of drugs and violence, a group of mothers whose sons have died in Vietnam have formed to mourn their sons and support each other but find that too much divides them. An artistic, wealthy and decadent couple complete the list of characters and their actions have a great impact on the lives of other characters.I’ll come clean at this point and admit that it didn’t take me long to realise this book just wasn’t my cup of tea! I had read glowing descriptions and reviews about it, so I kept going. All those others couldn't be wrong. Could they? However if I hadn’t been reading it to review I would have given up by page 31.Why didn’t I like it. Well maybe I wasn’t in the right mood to read this book, I was feeling quite down due to family worries. I have to say that very few of the characters interested me and I found the themes and language depressing. I will admit that at times I found his writing absolutely beautiful. His descriptions of the training that Petit did were wonderful but I found I couldn’t get interested in the tightrope walker at all. There was nothing elicited about the character, only his tightrope walking.The stories of the various characters varied significantly but I found nearly all of them depressing and a couple seemed totally irrelevant. The first story which set up the main tragedy of the book started really well with the two Irish brothers growing up in Dublin. However very soon it descended in to gloom and darkness, with the characters’ lives full of drugs, prostitution and death in New York. I would never have got beyond this part of the book if left to myself. Two of the stories just bored me, the photographer riding the subway and the computer hackers. There were touches of humour but not enough of them to lighten the novel for me. I sound as though all I want from a book is happy characters and a happy ending, I don’t. One of my favourite books is Captain Correlli’s Mandolin. That book reduced me to tears at times but then  within minutes I was laughing my head off and the characters were so full of life. Let The Great World Spin just didn’t move me at all.Still I plodded on reminding myself that luckily once I had finished, I had a PG Wodehouse Jeeves and Wooster book and a couple of the wonderful Patrick O’Brian novels about Aubrey and Maturin to lift my spirits. As I said earlier maybe I wasn’t in the right mood for this book and I should try it again when I'm in a more positive mood.View all my reviews on Goodreads >>Post No 155"},
{"title": "Woe is Me!    Post 152", "date": "Wednesday 19 May 2010", "text": "I’m a real misery today. I’ve just waved off my daughter and her family who are off on holiday to Rhodes. So why am I miserable? Well we booked this family holiday a year ago and have looked forward to it since then.  We go on holiday every year with them and it’s wonderful.  Mornings getting up to lovely sunshine and going to breakfast with them.  Days lazing by the pools, swimming with my grandchildren, games, wandering around the shops in old Rhodes Town, lovely meals as a family and no washing up! It’s bliss. I spend a lot of time with my grandchildren especially on holiday, so I'm going to miss them so much.  This year however it feels like there’s been a curse on it.  There were the flight problems with the volcanic ash cloud and then the troubles in Greece caused by their failing economy and closure of their airports.  However these pale into insignificance in comparison with our family problems.  My husband had to have a serious operation a few weeks ago and it will take him a long time to recover.  It’s one of the reasons why I haven’t been blogging and also I have no energy.  Things like this help you get things into perspective.   Well I had a few tears after they left about what we’re missing but I’m thankful Eric will hopefully make a good recovery and we can all have a holiday together next year.  I’m also thankful that the ash cloud problems are less, the problems in Greece have subsided and my family are all well and are going to have a lovely holiday.  It’s going to be a long fortnight without them and a long year until I see this lovely view again.                                             Kalithea Bay"},
{"title": "The Wireless - Post 151", "date": "Tuesday 20 April 2010", "text": "Source: Wiki CommonsThe word wireless means something totally different today to what it meant to me when I was growing up. It's an adjective today, when I was little it was a noun. The wireless was what's called radio today. Well most people call it radio. I don't, mostly I still call it the wireless.     I started wondering why it was called a wireless when it still had wires. So I looked it up and found some interesting stuff about it.     Apparently there's confusion over who invented radio, which at the time was apparently called wireless telegraphy, so understandably they shortened it to \"wireless\".     \"Radio is the wireless transmission of signals, by modulation of electromagnetic waves with frequencies below those of light.\" However, it still needed to be plugged in!     When I was little we used to listen to the wireless all the time, well we didn't have a telly until after the Coronation in 1953. Even after that we still listened to the wireless a lot as the telly programmes were only on in the evening.     My memories of listening to the wireless are mainly of Sundays after we'd been to church. Mam would be preparing the Sunday dinner, (we didn't call it lunch) and the wireless was always tuned to the BBC Light programme, (now Radio 2). The sounds and the smells of those Sundays are some of my strongest and happiest memories of my youth.     First was Two Way Family Favourites which had started life as Forces Favourites. It was a great request programme with Jean Metcalfe and Cliff Mitchelmore. There were other presenters but those two are the ones that stay in my mind. It must have had the most famous introduction to a British radio programme ever:\"The time in Britain is twelve noon, in Germany it's one o'clock, but home and away it's time for Two-Way Family Favourites\".     Take a trip down memory lane with that famous theme music \"With a Song in My Heart\".     Don't know why they don't resurrect it again for the forces in Iraq and Afghanistan. Would go down a treat. Crumbs, I nearly said bomb!     There were other programmes such as The Billy Cotton Band Show and The Clitheroe Kid. However my favourite out of all of them was Round The Horne.  I laughed 'til I cried listening to this.     It was absolutely wild and brilliant comedy, written by Marty Feldman and Barry Took. I'm sure the Python Team must have been influenced by it.     Rambling Syd Rumpold was one of my favourites. Here's a video clip of Kenneth Williams on the Michael Parkinson Show. He's one of the funniest people I've ever seen or heard. However I still think it was funnier on the wireless where you had to imagine all the visuals.I think we laughed because we couldn't understand half of it. The double entendres went right over our heads.  I wonder if that's how it got past the powers that be in the BBC. My Mam would have turned it off if she had understood what they were saying. We were obviously very naive back then. I grew up pretty clueless as she always switched off the telly if anything even slightly risque came on.     Here's an example of what now seems very rude. It's Julian and Sandy ( Kenneth Williams and Hugh Paddick) with Keep Britain Bona. Very topical with the General Election coming up!It could never be broadcast now, too politically incorrect, although you can buy the CDs. Not all of the stuff is so rude. There's a brilliant skit on the BBC where they recruit Kenneth Williams for a BBC job.  Great to listen to when you're bored. Maybe sitting in an airport? Really makes me laugh 'til I cry, partly through nostalgia no doubt.     I really miss those Sundays and the two Kenneths, bless them. Thank goodness for the wireless, it takes me back to a really happy time. I often wish I could go back there, just for the day.Post 151"},

{"title": "Hand Knitted Socks? - Post 149", "date": "Wednesday 31 March 2010", "text": "Now I've never understood the craze for knitted socks. Hand knitted ones I mean. I hadn't realised they were popular until I started looking at knitting patterns on the Internet. I thought they had died a death in the 'forties when women had to wear them because they couldn't get stockings. Well the alternative was painting that seam line up the back of their legs!I always hated the feel of wool on my feet when I was little. I could feel the pattern of the knitting digging into the soles of my feet and they made my shoes and boots feel tight.Even if the hand knitted socks are fine and made of 3ply wool, you have to wear a size bigger shoe. They're probably good with wellies, but as I don't ever wear wellies I've never felt the urge to knit socks.  I know you can buy really soft wools and cottons now but if I wear socks, they have to be thin cotton ones.I came across these free patterns for celebrity socks today. You can choose from Stephen Fry's QI socks, Rick Stein & Chalky or Alan Titchmarsh. So take a look and you can download the patterns free.Well I fell in love with the Alan Titchmarsh Fantasy socks.

I even blogged about it here.  I had great expectations of being able to do a passable front crawl by May. What a laugh!Well it's been a struggle I have to say. I found it hard to co-ordinate my leg kick, raising my arms out of the water and then putting my face into the water (YUK!) to breathe.I learned how to swim breast stroke putting my head under the water. Swimming this way means my neck doesn't hurt and I can swim for much longer. Funnily enough it's faster too. Learning this involved re-learning the stroke but I did it. However the front crawl seemed to be my Nemesis. I couldn't do more than about 10 metres unless I had flippers on. The breathing was my biggest problem, I was out of breath half way across the pool.I was determined not to give up, so I watched lots of YouTube videos on front crawl breathing. I marvelled at people like this who seemed to swim so effortlessly. Well Mark Foster probably learned to swim when he was very young and must have spent countless hours in the pool. Well he was after speed, I'm not. I just want to be able to swim a length with a bit of style, not splashing about.Now is it me, or do you think he looks like he's wearing flippers? He isn't, it's just his feet. Wonder what size shoes he wears!Well watching all those videos paid off, because today I finally swam 25 metres front crawl across the pool, face in the water, very little splashing and no flippers! It felt wonderful, not quite as good as passing my driving test but it just shows you can teach an old dog new tricks!I need to improve my style. It's not too bad, but as they say \"Could do better\"!  Then my target will be to swim a full 50 metre length.Wonder if I can manage a tumble turn?Must get back to the You Tube videos.Post 147"},

{"title": "You Can't Beat a Brass Band!", "date": "Sunday 24 January 2010", "text": "Blowing up the Shaft at Dawdon Pit Funny how listening to music can set you thinking and remembering. I heard the Grimethorpe Colliery Band playing today on the Alan Titchmarch Show and it started me thinking about what happened to that band and all those like it.I've never thought of myself as a political person, well not the political with a capital P. Yet it's funny how events can change you.My Dad, both my grandads, all my uncles and my brother were miners and we lived in a small mining town called Seaham in the North East of England. However I went to school in another town from the age of eleven and then later I went to work even further away. Eventually I got married and went to live in another town and apart from visiting my family I basically lost touch with the community.In 1984 events were set to change those mining communities forever. I didn't really support the Miner's Strike, even though my Dad and brother did. I thought it had been badly handled by the National Union of Mineworkers but like a lot of others, I assumed it would eventually be settled, they would go back to work and life would go on. How wrong we were!Sadly the Thatcher Conservative government saw fit to close the mines which not only destroyed the mining industry, it destroyed lives and whole communities in the process. Despite investment and European Regeneration funding many of these have never recovered. That Government and successive ones have had to buy coal from South America and Europe. Daft or what when there's coal in this country?From then on I changed when I saw how that Government operated to blight people's lives whilst at the same time creating a greedy generation of people who only cared about themselves, the ME, ME, ME society. I knew then I would always vote to keep out a Conservative government. It's no wonder we have such a horrendous greedy financial sector now, Margaret Thatcher set that in motion. You reap what you sow! End of my political comment, sorry if I've offended anyone but that's how it was.I still see the damaged community that was the town where I was born and grew up. When you're young you think things will never change, but they do and some events are irreversible. I doubt the town will ever regain the life and community spirit it had in the days when the mines were the centre of everything. The heart was torn out of it. Drugs and crime seem to thrive when everything else seems to decline. No matter how much they spend on redevelopment, new shops, factory units and roads, it doesn't resolve the problem. There are still so many people unemployed and housing stock that's depreciating because it's temporarily housing people from outside the area who have no real interest in the place where they live. One of the things that was evident in most mining communities when they thrived was a brass band. I remember the band from the town where I lived and the days when it marched alongside the miners and their families to go to the Miners' Big Meeting in Durham every year in July.  The music of brass bands can be haunting, inspirational and truly magnificent. Thankfully some of the brass bands from the mining communities not only survived, they thrived. The Grimethorpe Colliery Band is one of those bands and it was used to create the music for one of my favourite films, Brassed Off.  It was a superb film set in \"Grimley\", a thinly disguised version of the real South Yorkshire village of Grimethorpe. At the time it was criticised for being too political and critical of Thatcher’s Conservative Government. The thing is, it told the truth and told the story of folk whose jobs and lives were being taken away from them with the closure of the pit. The film starred Pete Poslethwaite, Ewan McGregor, Tara Fitzgerald and Stephen Thompkinson and was heartwarming, charming funny and truly uplifting. The music of the Grimethorpe Colliery Band was fantastic!  Well here's a clip from the film. While they are arguing about closing the mine, the band is rehearsing Rodrigo's Concierto de Aranjuez. Now you usually hear someone like John Williams playing this on a classical guitar but just listen to it. Totally haunting and so, so sad. No, it isn't Tara Fitgerald playing the flugelhorn, it's Paul Hughes from the real Grimethorpe band!It’s great to know that some of these bands which have survived including the Grimethorpe Colliery Band, have got a new CD out soon, The Music Lives on Now the Mines Have Gone. I’m off to order it!Post 143"},

The aim is at least one a month and I'm going to list it on the sidebar. So I could be shaming myself in the coming months!It's not exactly a New Year Resolution, just a realisation that something has got to be done about this before I pop my clogs and my secret stuff is revealed for everyone to see. The wool alone is taking up a mammoth amount of space and I can hardly close the cupboard door. Tomorrow it's the on-line tax self assessment to finish. YUK!!!!!Next the Mailart!Post 142"},
{"title": "Happy Birthday Elvis!", "date": "Friday 8 January 2010", "text": "I wasn't always an Elvis fan. I didn't like his early stuff. It was when I saw GI Blues that I started to like his singing. Funnily enough I still have that LP in its original cover.My favourite Elvis song was The Girl of My Best Friend but I also like Suspicion which I heard the first time I went to Spain in 1963.A girl I went to school with was an even madder fan than me and we used to go to the pictures together to see all his films. My other fnends were not that keen. The last time I went with her was to see Flaming Star. For anyone who hasn't seen the film, he dies at the end. As he was dying I had a lump in my throat even though it wasn't exactly the best of pictures or acting, it was just that it was Elvis. My friend didn't hold back though. She started to cry, then to sob really loud. Eventually the whole picture house could hear her and some people started laughing. I was absolutely mortified.Hard to believe he would have been 75 today. Even harder to believe is that my friend didn't even make it to her 35th birthday.I couldn't find a decent video of either of my favourite songs so here he is in his prime and in happier days in 1968. That's the way I like to remember him and my friend too.Post 141"},
{"title": "Christmas Reading", "date": "Monday 4 January 2010", "text": "Have to admit I've spent quite a lot of time reading these Christmas holidays. That's the result of too little on the telly that I fancied watching. Once I'd seen the two new episodes of Cranford, The final Doctor Who episodes and the last Gavin and Stacey, I was looking for other forms of entertainment.I had stocked up on books from the library before Christmas as I knew there wasn't exactly a blisteringly good TV schedule ahead. I managed to get about six Anne Perry books from the William Monk series about crime in Victorian England. I read a couple of them, then realised I had one missing so had to order it before I read the rest. I hate reading books out of chronological order. So while I was waiting for the next book to arrive I branched out into some other authors who had written books about Christmas.Skipping Christmas - John GrishamI feel a bit of a cheat writing about this book. Up front I’ll admit, I didn't get right to the end of it.  I was interested in this story about a couple who try to skip the commercialism of Christmas and go on a cruise. However it wasn’t because of any sense of sadness that the true spirit of Christmas has been lost. No! It was mainly because of the cost and the fact that their daughter is away from home for the first time in Peru! The book cover described it as hilarious. Well it certainly isn't what I'd call hilarious. I’m not sure whether it shows the difference between the American and British sense of humour or the fact that it's just inaccurate hype.  I managed to get through the first part of the book and words I hadn't a clue about like:- layaway - crunchy  - satellite lot - fire lane - sackers I eventually got about three-quarters of the way through and was beginning to admire the tenacity of the Kranks, in not giving in to neighbours, friends and colleagues who were critical of them giving up a so called traditional Christmas. (Have to say I'd emigrate if my Christmas was remotely like theirs!) However once their daughter rang on Christmas Eve saying she was coming home for Christmas and they abandoned their cruise and started to rush about like raving lunatics, I just gave up. It was ridiculous. Anyone with a single brain cell in their head would have already told their daughter they were going away on a cruise and if they hadn’t, then they certainly would have told her there and then. Once I start to read something, I usually see it through. Not this time! It was just too stupid to waste my time reading it any longer.I found it difficult to believe that this was written by the same person who wrote The Pelican Brief!     My other Christmas book was:This Year it Will be Different - Maeve BinchyNow I do like a bit of Maeve Binchy.  I’ve read a few of her novels, generally on holiday and they’ve been light with interesting and likeable characters.What I hadn’t realised was that this was a collection of short stories, so I was a little disappointed when I discovered that there were twenty two stories in this book. However it was a blessing today as I was looking after my granddaughter who doesn’t start school until tomorrow. So once I started to read it was quite useful to only have to concentrate for short periods at a time. Anyone who looks after a five year old girl will understand. You have to break off anything that you’re doing every ten minutes or so to help with spelling, singing, drawing, dancing, making drinks, straightening the tights after toilet visits, answering a million questions such as “Why haven’t you taken down your tree and Christmas lights?” and so forth!     I loved Maeve Binchy's assortment of stories, some humorous, other heartrending, but all interesting and thought provoking. Her myriad characters were interesting, not always likeable but many were delightful and I found I was disappointed that some of the stories were so short.. I wanted more! Always the sign of a good storyteller.Post 140"},
{"title": "The Gate of the Year", "date": "Thursday 31 December 2009", "text": "We’re at the end of not just a year, but the first decade of the century, ready to move into a new year and a new decade.    The last year or so has been a difficult one for lots of people, not just because of economic problems but there is the sadness due to loss of lives of troops serving in Iraq and Afghanistan.    I was reminded of the dark period at the end of 1939 when the Second World War had started in Europe. However dark things seem to get these days, I can’t begin to imagine what people felt like in that terrible time.   Seventy years ago, King George V1 made his Christmas broadcast as usual and at the end he used the first part of this inspirational poem, commonly known as At the Gate of the Year. However it’s correct title is God Knows:I said to the man who stood at the gate of the year'Give me a light that I may tread safely into the unknown.'   And he replied, 'Go into the darkness and put your hand into the hand of God That shall be to you better than light and safer than a known way!'  So I went forth and finding the Hand of God, Trod gladly into the night.And He led me towards the hills And the breaking of day in the lone East.   The second, lesser known and not quite so inspirational part of the poem continues with: So heart be still:What need our human life to know,If God hath comprehension?In all the dizzy strifeOf things both high and low,God hideth his intention.  God knows, His willIs best. The stretch of yearsWhich wind ahead, so dim,To our imperfect vision,Are clear to God. Our fearsAre premature: In HimAll time hath full provision.   Then rest; untilGod moves to lift the veilFrom our impatient eyes,When, as the sweeter featuresOf Life’s stern face we hail,Fair beyond all surmiseGod’s thought around His creaturesOur minds shall fill.  The poem was written by Minnie Louise Haskins who is often thought to be American. However she was English, a grocer's daughter, brought up at Warmley, Bristol. She studied at London School of Economics and eventually taught in the social science department there until 1944.The poem had been drawn to the King's attention by Queen Elizabeth, the present Queen's mother, and the lines were to be recited 63 years later at her own funeral.Now there are two lessons I take from this:1. I don't believe everything I read on the Internet. I like to check the source out.2. No matter how bad things seem, who knows what the breaking of the day will bring. Tomorrow is another day, fresh, clean and untouched. It's down to me to help shape it.  Whatever the year ahead holds for us all, I hope it is a healthy and a happy one for you and your family. As my Dad used to say at New Year, \"Here's wishing you everything you'd wish yourself!\" Have a wonderful year in 2010.                             Post 139"},
{"title": "Monaco", "date": "Tuesday 29 December 2009", "text": "Time to get back to the cruise. I need to revisit the sun!We arrived in Monaco in the early morning and the views of the harbour were quite good. It isn’t as grand as Valletta nor as impressive as Barcelona but it was still quite a view.Here's another view of the coastline. A few too many high rise blocks for my taste.Monaco is a self-governed sovereign nation under the protection of France. It has been ruled by the Grimaldi family for the past 700 years (apart from a short period during the French Revolution), and its 1918 treaty with France decreed that if the prince -- any Grimaldi prince -- failed to produce a son, the territory would be ceded back to France upon his death. This was changed in 2002, if Albert II, the current prince, fails to produce a male heir, the throne will be passed to his sister Caroline. At present Albert is isn’t married!Monaco, is tiny, 485 acres in total, and surrounded by France on all sides except for the 2.5 miles of coastline. The principality has no natural resources whatsoever; its national economy is based on tourism and banking. Lots of famous people live in this tax haven. These include Formula One World Champion Jensen Button, Lewis Hamilton, David Coulthard, Shirley Bassey, Ringo Starr, Roger Moore and lots more.We decided to just have a walk up to The Rock to see, the Royal Palace, Monaco-ville which is the original fortified town of Monaco, the Oceanographic Museum and Saint Nicholas Cathedral.It was very hot as we walked up towards the Royal Palace and we decided to hang about to see the changing of the guard outside the Palace. Here's the lone guardsman before the changing took place.A couple more arrive.Here they are changing the guard.There they go, it's all over!Quite a laid back event compared to the changing of the guard at Buckingham Palace. For one thing there were no railings keeping the tourists back, security was low key. For another the guards were chatting to each other!I loved the colours of the buildings, very attractive. There seems to be a predominance of pink in the choice of colours. Looked a lot like marshmallows or strawberry and vanilla ice cream.I did like these buildings on Monaco-ville.  Can’t remember what this one was but it was an administrative one. There were some nice traditional streets too. Next on the route was the cathedral. This is where Princess Grace and Prince Rainier were married and they are also buried here. I took a couple of photos of the cathedral but I didn’t really like to take them of the burial places although others didn’t have any qualms about it.Along the side of The Rock facing the sea are the Saint Martin Gardens. There were quite a lot of statues and some great trees and plants.This is a Yew Tree donated to the Gardens by a charity. The bark of the tree contains taxol which is used in cancer treatments. It symbolises the hope and commitment of the charity and the Principality of Monaco to finding a cure for women's cancers.On the way down to the harbour are some great houses.Wonder how much these cost? Pink again!The Oceanographic Museum is constructed on the edge of The Rock and in front is a Yellow Submarine! Didn’t have time to go in, maybe next time.It was starting to get a bit choppy by the time we were walking back. You can see along the side of the Museum how it's built on The Rock and close to the sea.You can see the swell was getting bigger here.Back up on The Rock you could get some great shots of the marina and the harbour.One of the things Monaco is famous for is the Grand Prix Formula One race which takes place in May. The track is actually in the middle of the city, it uses the road system and goes under an overpass within direct view of the cruise ship dock.Here's one of the tunnels they use which as I said is just one of the ordinary roads.Near to where the ship was docked were these Daimler Darts which were there for a rally. My husband showed more interest in these than anything else we saw in Monaco!After lunch I decided to have a walk out again by myself, Eric had done the tourist thing and was going to the gym and then lazing about on deck.I walked along the marina and went to cross the road. Good grief, the traffic was incredible. I had quite a difficult job to take a decent photo of sculpture of Juan Manuel Fangio, the famous racing driver and his car. It was almost in the middle of the road!  Fangio dominated the first decade of Formula One racing. He won five Formula One World Driver's Championships, this record stood for 46 years until eventually beaten by Michael Schumacher. Many still consider him to be the greatest driver of all time.Just look at where they've put it. Surely they could have found somewhere better where people can get a good look at it. For goodness sake, it's in the middle of a really busy road.I have to say there was a lot of renovation work going on around the marina, boards up etc so I didn't see the place at its best. There were some quite nice streets but nothing special apart from this square which was very attractive. Pink again!I'm a sucker for teddy bear shops!We didn't get to Monte Carlo. I was going to get on the little train but it stops running quite early. Maybe next time!I did get a photo of the casino from the ship.One thing I was really disappointed with was the quality of cafes and restaurants around the marina.  They were really tacky looking. Not a tablecloth in sight. Some of the little places we visited in Italy and Greece were far superior. Maybe we hit a bad day.The views of Monaco from the ship were good but this one doesn't show a pretty picture. Just a place with lots of concrete blocks of flats. Maybe this isn't where the rich and famous live. I bet the flats are still expensive though. Not my cup of tea! Someone on the ship said the buildings reminded them of Hong Kong. I've never been but I knew what they meant.If I could afford a flat abroad it wouldn't be here I have to say, it would be in Barcelona! Now that's a fantastic city with a wonderful marina. The restaurants there are fabulous.Post 138"},

Have to say it was fascinating stuff, nothing like I’d imagined. Just shows how you can be misled.   Ethnobotanist (didn’t know there was such a job and me an ex careers adviser!) James Wong, took an organic approach to the festive season using lots of Christmas plants to create remedies, gifts and wonderful decorations. The programme culminated in a winter garden party of all things.   He showed you how to use winter plants from your garden make things such as ivy toning cream, holly truffles and an anti inflammatory orange, clove and myrrh massage oil. To help those who have a tendency to over indulge, he created a rosehip sherbet fizzy drink remedy, and fennel and peppermint rice just in case you’ve eaten too many sprouts! Then there was a stress busting egg nog, a hot toddy made from a Christmas tree and cystitis relieving cranberry mince pies.  I loved his presenting style, enthusiastic and humorous. I’ll watch out for his next series.    If you want to see his recipes they’re available here Grow Your Own Drugs Christmas Recipes   and the programme is available to watch on iPlayer for the next seven days.

I realise my header is not very seasonal but I like looking at photos that conjure up happy memories. Anyway you can see Christmas and winter photos everywhere so I'm just going to be the exception! Maybe I'll put some Christmassy stuff up in July! Back to the story.Well I'd heard about Amalfi from friends who had been there but don't think I've ever seen it. Although I think I might have caught a glimpse in a James Bond film once.Here's our first view of the coastline.Now here we are again. Lots of houses up on the hills! Although the view must be fantastic, I still wouldn't like to live up there. Just imagine having to work in those terraced gardens. The drop over the edge of that cliff doesn't bear thinking about. Every time it rained I'd think the house was going to slide down but I suppose they must be quite safe.Here's the beach at Amalfi which is quite nice. The sand wasn't very fine or golden. Maybe it's a man made beach but the water looked very inviting. Again we hadn't taken bathing costumes!It was very busy in the town, well it was Saturday but luckily there were no cruise ships there, other than ours of course.I loved the way the Sant Andrea cathedral was pressed between the buildings as if it was an afterthought and they just didn't have enough room or money to build a detached cathedral. Lovely coming out of church and just straight over to sit in one of the cafes for a cuppa. Another church you had to pay to enter so we gave it a miss.Just look at the steps up there. Not sure how they make that accessible for wheelchairs. Think they'd have to put a lift in.  At home they've got rid of some beautiful steps in front of churches and other buildings and put in the most hideous ramps. I still can't believe they allow traffic up these streets. They are full of people and so narrow.There were lots of tourist shops but some great fruit and veg ones too.Luvly jubbly!Obviously they grow lots of lemons in this area, the shops were full of Limoncella which is the famous local liqueor.Now I'd love to be able to buy tomatoes like this instead of the EU regulation all the same size and colour ones we get. They tell us that that's what the customers have demanded. Total rubbish!Just look at those gorgeous peppers.I had to take a picture of this briliant balcony. It was a part of a little clothes shop. It's an unusual way to display clothes. Here's a close up.Here's a derelict little chapel. Yes, it's high on the hill!Next stop is Livorno, Italy!Post 134"},

{"title": "Sorrento and Capri -  Friday 11 September", "date": "Sunday 29 November 2009", "text": "It was hot again today so we didn’t rush off after breakfast. Well when you’re on holiday why would you want to rush about? Some did but not us.   The ship docked at Sorrento and we had been advised to go to Capri as it is so pretty, so off we went. The plan was to visit Capri until early afternoon and then come back to Sorrento and have a wander about there before we went back to the boat. Well that was the plan.Grand Harbour, CapriAs I said it was hot and off we went to get the ferry from Sorrento to Capri. It was quite a fast trip and we docked in Capri  Harbour at about 10.30. Well when we got off the ferry we ended up in the most horrendously crowded place I can remember being in for ages and what made it worse was the heat. Crumbs it was scorching. We looked for the so called cog railway up to Capri Town but the place was so crowded we couldn’t see the entrance. The bus stop was crowded as you can see from the photo above, so we decided to take a walk up the road and see what was there.     Now we had only walked a few minutes up the road and I looked down and wished we had brought our bathing costumes. The beach was a tad crowded for me but looked very tempting on such a warm day.Very tempting!Heigh Ho! Here's a nice looking little hotel with a fabulous view over the cliffs and beach.We started to get a bit worried as we were walking because there were no footpaths. It reminded me of a time when we got lost at night in Rome and yes, no footpaths and no street lights either. At least it was broad daylight here but Eric was definitely getting the willies!Look No Footpaths!The buses, taxis and cars coming down were not exactly moving very slowly.  Yes buses actually came down here. Wondered if there was another way to go up because there certainly wasn't room to pass. Eventually I saw a cut through a street to some steps and we ended up on a footpath going up the back of the town.After we'd been walking about half an hour this was the view of the very busy little harbour.This was the view to the other side of the road.Not sure what this was but it looked like there had been vines there.Further up there was another wonderful view.Here's where we went in through what seemed the back gate to Capri Town. Very picturesque.The place was absolutely beautiful once we got up there but it was a little overcrowded with day trippers.     Lots of very fancy shops with lovely stuff at exorbitant prices!     I really loved this plaque outside a really nice gourmet shop. This looked like a nice café. It had black and white photos of famous people who had presumably visited it, Rod Stewart, Sylvester Stallone, Liz Hurley etc. Capri is a place where the rich and famous hang out but I bet they don’t come out until after the ferries have left with the day trippers.We drifted through the lovely little streets window shopping, no need to worry about cars here.Came across a lovely hotel right in the middle of the shops. Very classy. Very posh!Eventually we headed along a nice little street, yes no traffic as it was very narrow. The houses were on the left of the little path and over on the right were their patios cum gardens.Take a look at this one! What a corking view but no good if you suffer from vertigo.You’d have to be an exhibitionist to come out here during the day but isn’t it fantastic. Look at that amazing view and get those white settees! Obviously doesn't rain much here.We passed another lovely little hotel. Mind you’d have to carry your luggage from the town centre though, no cars along this road. It got me wondering how people who live there manage to get furniture, fridges and washers delivered. They must have something to deliver them. Maybe a little wagon or perhaps they have a special delivery service. A hulking great bloke who can carry anything!     We walked along to the end of the little street and there is an amazing hotel there, Punta Tragara, a salmon coloured building designed by Le Corbusier. The view from the hotel is fantastic overlooking the Faraglioni Rocks and I managed to get a picture before the battery in the camera expired.Apparently there's a fantastic beach at the bottom of the cliffs. Have to say we just didn't have the energy to climb down and then back up again. I was just about to take a photo of the hotel when the battery finally ran out on my camera. There was a plaque on the wall saying that Roosevelt and Churchill had met here during the war. My goodness that pair certainly knew how to pick the good places to stay didn’t they!Well we headed back and managed to find the cog railway which took us down to the harbour in a few minutes. That was when it got nasty. It was very hot and there was just no shade in the harbour. I asked a policewoman which pier we needed to go back to Sorrento as I have to say we couldn’t see any information anywhere. Well this was the rudest police officer I have ever met in my life. Must have trained at the Bernard Manning school of charm and elegance! I gathered from what she shouted at me, that somewhere “over there” was an information board. Well we wandered about for a few minutes and eventually found a digital display board. Guess what? It was set in direct sunlight so the information was totally impossible to read.So we walked along the pier past the ferries to see if we could find the ferry which was due in about an hour. Well health and safety regulations obviously don’t apply in Capri, well probably the whole of  Italy. They obviously opt out of all the EU Directives we idiots in the UK go headlong into applying. As we walked past a ferry from Naples the cars and lorries started to pile off and we, along with about 10 other travellers, got stuck against the wall in danger of being crushed. The ferry staff and police did absolutely nothing to get people out of the way or stop more people coming. Just don’t understand why they didn’t block the area off until the ship unloaded. The heat and fumes were appalling.After about 20 minutes we managed to get past and walked along to the end of the pier but there were no signs anywhere. So we had to brave it back again past the ferries unloading to find an information point. It was absolutely scorching and for some inane reason I hadn’t taken a hat, just suntan cream. Eventually we just asked someone who was working around the harbour and low and behold it was back along at the end of the pier where we had already been.      Finally we joined a very small queue for the Sorrento ferry which grew very rapidly. I started to get a little worried knowing the problems with queues or lack of them aborad. I was right, by the time the ferry started to take passengers on board we got pushed and shoved, eventually I thought I’d go over the edge into the water. What a nightmare. The ferry chappie started shouting at everybody in Italian which most people, including me, wouldn’t have understood. Now if he had just had the good sense to start to let people onto the ferry before the queue got too big it wouldn’t have happened. It’s really one of the things I hate about being abroad, especially in Italy, they just don’t understand the concept of waiting your turn.     By the time we got back my husband was none to keen to look around Sorrento, he’d had enough. Have to say I wasn’t keen either as the ship’s bus had stopped running and we’d have to get a taxi back down to the tender point. So we went back to the ship to relax, cool down and stuff our faces with high tea looking out over the bay. Good choice!     Have to say I'm glad we went to Capri as it was so pretty but not sure I'd go back again unless it was later in the year when there'd be less tourists.Final Sorrento sunset shot after I'd charged the battery.Next stop Amalfi!Post 132"},

We really are such wimps.This port was small so the ship couldn't dock and we had to use the tender for the first time! Here it is from the deck above. No we didn't have to reach it from that height!

Haven't seen them at home yet but then again I don't exactly live in a tourist resort.Even though it's not a classy resort but there were some quite nice little restaurants along the sea front but they were all deserted. It was pretty hot so we had a seat and just watched the world go by.Now here's something we saw that surprised us. This woman just parked her car on a zebra (pedestrian) crossing even though there numerous car parking spaces around. Talk about lazy and selfish!Here's something else that's a little out of the ordinary for us. Not sure what it was looked like a memorial. Just look at those rocks it's set into.Other things we saw a few times were these, commemorating anniversaries. A much better idea than just sticking a notice in a local paper. They were posted in a few places around the little town.As we were getting near to the place where the tender was going to pick us up we looked back and saw how the darker clouds were coming in. That's why I didn't want to go to Mount Etna, there's no shelter there. You'd think living in Britain I'd be used to rain wouldn't you.Well when I'm on holiday I avoid rain like the plague. When we went to Rome a family of Americans thought we were crazy because I didn't want to go to get the Pope's Sunday blessing. Well it was tipping it down  and yes I'm a Catholic but I make no exceptions for anyone!Just look, there they go again, living on the top of those mountains. Now I have no idea why they want to live up there. It won't even be peaceful.I keep wondering whether they are they expecting a tsunami or something? Well it is an area of earthquake activity so maybe they're safer up there.Next stop, Sorrento!Post 130"},
{"title": "Memories", "date": "Wednesday 11 November 2009", "text": "A two minute silence was observed at 11.00 am GMT across the country today. The silence is observed at the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month and marks the moment that four years of war ended with the signing of the Armistice Treaty by Germany and the Allies.This year was particularly poignant as it also marks the passing of a generation. The last of the British World War I veterans died during the year.Today in Westminster Abbey a special Armistice Day service was held following the deaths of Bill Stone who was 108, Henry Allingham 113 and Harry Patch, 111.I was wondering whether whether any other countries mark this signing of the armistice with a two minutes silence. It certainly seems to be increasing in the UK with shops, offices, factories, schools etc falling silent. The wars in Afghanistan and Iraq perhaps make us realise how peace is never really with us and also how grateful we should be that people gave up their lives so we can live in freedom.Dame Vera Lynn singing We'll Meet Again is probably the most memorable World War 2 song in the UK and the Commonwealth. The Forces Sweetheart was only 22 when she first recorded it and is now the grand old age of 92.She toured Europe and The Far East during the Second World War providing a much needed boost to the morale of the forces. The song was popular not just because it was a great tune and she was a wonderful singer, but because it lifted people's spirits in a very dark and frightening time.I was born towards the end of World War 2 and when I was little, this was still a very popular song. We had very little money to go on holiday and so I used to go on bus day trips with my grandparents to York, Edinburgh, Scarborough, The Lake District and other popular places in Scotland and the North of England. On the way back the people always used to sing popular songs of the day and some from the Wars. We'll Meet Again is one I always remember and it brings back lots of happy memories of those times.Dame Vera stopped performing in 1999 so at the Festival of Remembrance on Saturday in The Royal Albert Hall, Hayley Westenra performed the song with the Fron Male Voice Choir. You can see the performance below. At 2 mins 49 seconds the video screens show Vera Lynn singing and some wartime film of Allied troops. She attended the Festival and you can see her right at the end of the video. She is still very popular.Surprisingly sales of a CD she released last month, - The Very Best of Vera Lynn made history as she became the oldest living person to top the UK album chart. Not content with that, her record company is releasing a new single of We'll Meet Again for Christmas. They've used the original version of her vocals and added the Fron Male Voice Choir to it. She'll be going head to head with the single of whoever wins X Factor. Normally that single wins because of the music downloads generated by the programme. However we'll see!It was good to see that this year Hayley Westenra and Dame Vera Lynn jointly launched the Royal British Legion's Poppy Appeal which aims to raise £31 million to support the Afhgan War's generation of wounded and bereaved.Post 129"},
{"title": "National War Museum - Valletta    Post 128", "date": "Thursday 5 November 2009", "text": "Main Entrance to Fort St ElmoThe National War Museum is situated in a building known as the Old Drill Hall in Lower Fort St Elmo at the tip of the Valletta peninsula. It was originally built in 1553 to protect the entrance to The Grand Harbour of Valletta. The Fort was destroyed during the Great Siege of 1565 and reconstructed in 1567, there have been some modifications since then.It now houses the Police Academy and a small part is occupied by The National War Museum. In more recent times, part of it was used as a film location jail for Midnight Express. It did look a little bit sad when we were there and in need of a bit of work to tidy it up but the entrance to the Museum has been renovated.I visited the National War Museum about twelve years ago but it was completely renovated earlier this year and the change is amazing. Shame they haven't renovated The Fort, it's looking very neglected. Given its historical importance in the two sieges it really should be a big tourist attraction.The Museum's collection focuses on the two World Wars 1914-1918 and 1939-1945. It recounts the story of the events which led to the two wars, their development, major actions and consequences locally and abroad.Special reference is made to the role of Malta in the theatre of war and the contribution of the Maltese population to the war effort especially during the incredibly difficult conditions of 1942.The visit begins with the origins of the First World War, the outbreak, major battles on land and sea and Malta's role as naval base and Nurse of the Mediterranean. Artifacts on display include German machine guns, trench mortars and a torpedo.The fighter force defending Malta was a very small force of British-operated Gladiators, three were named Faith, Hope and Charity.  Have to say Faith and Hope were  very apt names for these planes.  You can see more about them on this website and here's a photo of Faith on display in the National war Museum. I was amazed at how small the plane was. FaithI found an amazing piece of video on Google. It's an excerpt from a rare WW11 Italian colour documentary showing shows Italian and German air forces from an air field in Sicily on a bombing mission over Malta in 1942, with scenes of air battle against RAF Spitfire interceptors. It's really awful watching the bombs drop.Here are some photographs of the various Armed Forces uniforms on displayRoyal NavyThis is exactly what my Dad would have been wearing when he was in Valletta During World War 11. I remember him talking about his bell bottoms which traditionally had to have the creases horizontally across the trouser legs as well as vertically because they had to be kept folded in their kit bags. Apparently the sailors wore bell bottoms so that they could roll the bottoms up when they were working in the rigging. Obviously not during WW11!Love those \"whites\"!I really loved this Air Raid Precaution first aid kit. Note the old Boots the chemist logo!ARP First Aid KitIt's a great museum and has lots of personal memorabilia and awards.This is one awarded to Carmelo Zammit who was killed when HMS Louvain was torpedoed by the U-Boat UC22 on 21 January 1918 in the Aegean Sea.Here's another from World War 11 awarded to Frederick Neville Riley of the Merchant Navy.There were lots more materials which have been donated to the museum by servicemen and women's families. One of the saddest was a letter notifying a Royal Navy seaman's wife in England of his death. It was written in what seems an absolutely callous way and included information on how she could claim for him. There was a photograph of him in uniform and a lovely postcard he had sent to her. It was so sad.On Friday 15 April 1942 the entire island of Malta was awarded the George Cross, the highest civilian award for gallantry. The award is not given lightly and was unprecedented in British history.For more information about The Cross and its recipients take a look at The George Cross Database . The importance of the award was keenly felt by the Maltese people at the time and provided a much needed boost to the morale of the country whilst it was being constantly bombed and its people were starving.The George Cross is mounted in a simple wooden frame with the letter from King George V1 and is housed in the National War Museum. I've just bought a copy of James Holland's book Fortress Malta - An Island Under Siege 1940 -1943. So I hope to find out lots more about this amazing island and its people during that time.Post 128Source: Heritage Malta"},
{"title": "Honest Scrap Award", "date": "Monday 26 October 2009", "text": "I’m feeling thoroughly ashamed of myself! It’s ages since Bogey at A View From the Fairway gave me this award. In fact I was on holiday when he posted it. My thanks and abject apologies to you Bogey but not only am I a procrastinator extraordinaire I'm also an inefficient Blogger. I found this was still just a draft as I checked through my posting list. What a wassock!I’m really honoured that you thought me an honest blogger. I do always post as honestly as I can, hopefully without offending people.Well it’s all about honesty so I have to post 10 honest things about me. Now that has taken some time, that leads nicely to the first on the list: I don’t open up to people easily or show emotions in public. That's probably how I've taken so long to do this. Sadly it’s a family trait I inherited from my Dad. My Mam was very different, wish I had been more like her. I’ve tried to open up on lots of occasions but it’s just not my nature.I like my own personal space. Don’t like people invading it. Hugging doesn’t come naturally to me unless it’s with my grandchildren. After I went to Spain to stay with a family it helped, a bit!I’m a bit of a perfectionist about lots of things so I put off doing them or I don’t complete them in case they’re not quite right, well perfect really. Sadly I think my grand daughter has inherited an even more extreme version of this trait!I’m a messy, untidy person. I used to have a sign on my desk that said “A clean desk is the sign of a sick mind”. It made me feel better. Luckily I shared an office with a woman whose desk made mine look like I was obssessively tidy. Hers was a public health hazard!One thing I’m not messy with is my clothes. I’m a bit fanatical about washing them in lots of separate colour washes, ironing every crease out of them and repairing them. It all has to be done just right! I'm such a pain but I can’t help it.I hate the sound of the phone ringing. I just keep thinking, “Go away!” I detest using my mobile, they’re the devil’s invention at times.I hate cooking and feel really guilty when I try to get out of it. I do love eating though.I despise dishonesty.I’ve never had my ears pierced and never will. Why? When I was little my Mam told me that only common people and gypsies had their ears pierced. It stuck in mind. It didn't go down well with her mother in law though. She had pierced ears!I’m lazy, really lazy. I could sleep until midday in winter. I hate housework. I do clean the bathroom and toilets regularly though, can’t abide them being dirty. I would sit and sew or knit all day and night if I could. Once an old very houseproud great auntie told me that my nanna (her sister) could sit and sew while the ashes from the fire were falling off the fireplace. I burst out laughing and told a shocked auntie that at last I knew who I took after. I know that if I lived on my own I would stay in my pyjamas all day unless I had to go out somewhere, eat sandwiches for every meal, hoover once a fortnight and sew all day and night! Well I hope I’ve been honest enough.Now to the rules of this award: You must brag about the award. (Not sure how to do this) You must include the name of the blogger who bestowed the award on you and link back to the blogger. You must choose a minimum of six (6) blogs that you find brilliant in content or design. Show their names and links and leave a comment informing them that they were prized with Honest Weblog.List at least ten (10) honest things about yourself.Now I find it hard to pick just 6 people as I subscribe to so many brilliant blogs. I’m going to cheat here and say please feel free to take the award. I trust you! For my final piece of honesty here goes. When I first saw the award I misread it. I didn’t see it as Honest Scrap. I missed the letter S in scrap. Sorry but as I said earlier, it’s all about honesty.Post 127"},
{"title": "Blood Rock - James Jackson", "date": "Sunday 25 October 2009", "text": "I think I'm getting a bit obsessional about Malta and its history since we visited Valletta again last month.  Strange because history never grabbed me at school, I preferred geography.My previous posting about Mark Harris' book, The Information Officer, covered the second Great Siege of Malta during World War 11, this book is an excellent historical novel based on the epic Great Siege of Malta in 1565.The Knights of St John are under siege in Malta from the great Ottoman armada of Suleiman the Magnificent who intends to wipe them out. They are greatly outnumbered by the Ottomans and there's also a traitor amongst them whose identity is hidden until the very end.   It's a brutal story based on fact and fictional characters are intertwined with the historical ones like The Grand Master of The Knights, John Parisot de la Valette and Mustapha Pasha, commander of the Turkish land forces.  The hero, Christian Hardy is a bit of a cliche and on occasions more of a superhero than a soldier, nevertheless he's an interesting one.I have to say the book makes history come to life and would make quite a good film. It's a far better read than Dan Brown's novels which are frequently historically inaccurate.For anyone contemplating a visit to Malta, it gives you a good insight into the geography of the country as well as the appalling hardships the people of this island have endured over the centuries.  Post 126"},
{"title": "The Information Officer", "date": "Monday 19 October 2009", "text": "I saw this book when I was visiting Valletta last month. It was the number one best seller in one of the shops we visited and so I had a look at the synopsis and was intrigued. I didn't buy it because of luggage restrictions but made a note of it. I eventually got it from our local library and once I started to read it I couldn't put it down. It’s a murder mystery, a love story and a historic novel all rolled into one. The first and last chapters are set one evening in a London restaurant in 1951, but the main story evolves over 9 days in Malta in the summer of 1942, at the height of the terrible German and Italian bombing raids.The story plays out against the background of Malta, the island fortress, during that great siege of 1942 providing extensive information about its geography and history. It is well written and researched with maps to help you identify the scenes of the action.The author Mark Mills captures the feelings of a whole range of characters, British officers, other ranks, their wives, girlfriends as well as the occupied local people. They have to deal with a whole spectrum of issues, good and evil, life and death, truth and mendacity, love and hatred, joy and grief.The central character, Max Chadwick is the Information Officer whose role is to keep up the morale of the islanders.  When he finds out that a British Officer is murdering local women he has to cope with the conflict between his patriotic duty of keeping the information under wraps and his personal honour, finding the truth and the murder.I found the characters interesting and believable with insight into the feelings of the occupied and their occupiers during this traumatic time.The plot twists and turns as the author moves between the main story and glimpses into the motivations of the murderer keeping you guessing about the identity of the villain right to bitter end. If I have a criticism it’s that the murderer seemed the last person you would have expected, maybe that’s why the author picked them, but for me it made it a little less believable.I really enjoyed this book the setting for me was wonderful, I loved the atmosphere, the characters with their touches of black humour and the fact it had quite a happy ending. It's not quite in the class of Captain Corelli's Mandolin but it is a very good read.Post 125"},
{"title": "Valleta, Malta - World Heritage City - Wednesday 9 September", "date": "Sunday 18 October 2009", "text": "Valletta     (Wiki Commons)Valletta is a wonderful port of call. I'll say now it's my favourite, even though I do love Rhodes.We went on holiday to Malta for a couple of weeks about twelve years ago and whilst we were there we visited Valletta a couple of times. We always said we'd go back but never had until the cruise.I've written some brief information about Valletta, apologies if I've made mistakes, maybe Loree will correct them. She knows much more about it than I do naturally as it's her homeland! Take a look at her website Snapshots of Malta. She has some lovely photographs.The city has many titles, The Fortress City, City Umilissima, “a city built by gentleman for gentlemen”, and apparently it's known colloquially as Il-Belt, The City. All these titles recall its great historical past.The city was built by The Knights of St John and was named after its founder The Grand Master of The Order of St John, Jean Parisot de Valette. However the city really owes its birth to his arch enemy, Grand Turk, Suleiman the Magnificent. The Knights had been driven out of Rhodes and they were given the island of Malta by Charles V to help protect Rome from invasion. Serious assaults occurred between 1551 and 1664, the most famous, The Great Siege took place in 1565. A Turkish force of about 30,000 men was repelled by 600 knights and 6,000 soldiers and volunteers. Only about 15,000 attackers survived and very few of the defenders went uninjured.For the next 275 years these “Knights of Malta” made the island their domain. They built towns, palaces, churches, gardens and fortifications as well as embellishing the island with works of art and enhanced cultural heritage. Valletta with its impressive bastions, forts and cathedral was completed in 15 years. By the turn of the 16 Century it was a sizeable city and people from across the islands came to live within the safety of its bastions.The Knights' reign ended when Napoleon Bonaparte's fleet arrived in 1798. Within months the French were closing convents and seizing church treasures. The Maltese people rebelled, and the French garrison of General Claude-Henri Belgrand de Vaubois retreated into Valletta. After several failed attempts by the local people to retake Valletta, they asked the British for assistance. Rear Admiral Lord Horatio Nelson decided on a total blockade, and in 1800 the French garrison surrendered. British rule began in 1800. The Second World War proved another testing time for Malta when the city came under siege yet again. It was a crucial British post in the Mediterranean, the last line of defence against the Nazis. The island received heavy aerial bombardment from the Italian and German air forces which reached its peak in 1942. The island was the most bombed place on earth during World War 11. It was awarded the George Cross for its people's valour.The Royal Opera House constructed at the city entrance in the 19 th Century, was one of the buildings lost to the raids. Here you can see what it looked like before the War.Grand Opera HouseThe site has never been cleared or rebuilt. Maybe it's a permanent memorial of the damage caused by war. Here's how it looks today with people walking over and around it. It certainly does make you think.Site of Royal Opera HouseI didn't see any signs around to let you know what the site was but it was quite crowded, maybe I missed them. I researched it later and discovered what it was.On 15 April 1942, King George V1 awarded the George Cross (the highest civilian award for gallantry) \"to the island fortress of Malta — its people and defenders”. The original George Cross and the letter from King George V1 are framed and now housed in the National War Museum. George CrossThe plaque commemorating the award is on the wall of the Grand Master's Palace which houses the President's office and the Parliament also meets there.President Franklin Roosevelt, describing the wartime period, called Malta \"one tiny bright flame in the darkness.\" There is another plaque commemorating this alongside the previous one. Unfortunately the Roosevelt one was covered by scaffolding when we were there.After World War 11, the islands achieved self-rule and on 21 September 1964, Malta became an independent state and a republic on 13 December 1974. Malta joined the EU in May 2004.Despite so much bombing, the handsome limestone buildings and fortifications that the wealthy knights left behind are still all around the city and the islands. Many of these, in particular the Forts, were used by British Forces before, during and after World War 11.My Dad was in the Royal Navy during the war and I know he was in Valletta. He didn't talk about the War and I'm ashamed to admit I didn't ask him about it. Now it's too late. I know he loved Malta as he revisited it in the 'seventies with my step mother, she has told me a little about their visit and how much he enjoyed it.Fort St AngeloFort Ricasoli and Harbour WallsFort St Elmo WallsFort St MichaelI read somewhere that sailing into Malta Grand Harbour would be like sailing into a film set and it's true, the architecture is wonderful. It's really like sailing back in time.  It's not the only harbour in Valletta however, there's also Marsamxett Harbour.We were advised to get up early to see the ship dock and it was well worth it. I was disappointed with my photographs especially the ones taken in the early morning, a lot were very poor. This one was taken later just before we sailed.Here you can see the Saint Lazarus Bastion and the Great Siege Bell.Saint Lazarus Bastion and Great Siege BellThe Great Siege Bell was inaugurated in 1992 by Queen Elizabeth 11 to commemorate the dead of World War 11.Great Siege BellWe found it very safe and quite easy to walk about the city although there are a few streets which are a bit steep. It’s a bit cooler and quieter in the early evening if you just want to explore the city streets. We visited in September and a huge MSC cruise ship docked just after us and seemed to swamp the city with tours of Italians everywhere we went during the day. I think these ships carry about 3,000 people. I wonder what the people of Valletta think about their lovely city being swamped with tourists.There’s been a long connection between the British and Malta and World War 11 certainly cemented that connection. The people of Malta certainly showed great courage during that terrible time.Malta is a very popular tourist destination for British people, they still have a great admiration and affection for it. Now it’s also a popular cruise port. There are lots of things that remind you of home in Britain. Look familiar?I've seen these two before.  No not the people!Mind you at home they've changed our lovely red telephone boxes into nondescript supposedly unbreakable aluminium and plastic things. Horrible! Bring back the lovely old red ones like this!There are also lots of British and international shops like M&S, British Home Stores, Tommy Hilfiger, Colours of Benetton etc. This shop is in a much more interesting building than many of its UK counterparts. Most tourists seem to visit the Baroque St John’s Co-Cathedral and the queues we saw proved that. It apparently contains incredible memorials to the Knights of St John as well as Caravaggio’s ‘Beheading of St John the Baptist’. We opted out of the queue as I really dislike going into churches full of tourists and have an objection to paying to go into churches.  I refuse to pay to go into Westminster Cathedral too.  So we visited the church of St Paul’s Shipwreck. This church is known as The Hidden Gem and has a magnificent altarpiece and other fine artistic works. It also houses a relic of St Paul’s wrist bone and a piece of the column on which he was beheaded in Rome! No charge just a voluntary contribution and absolute peace and quiet. Definitely a little gem.There’s a number of gardens in Valletta worth visiting.  The Lower and Upper Barrakka Gardens have wonderful views of the Grand Harbour. Upper Barrakka Gardens Looking onto Grand HarbourThe Upper Gardens contain lots of statues and monuments including those of Winston Churchill and Albert Einstein. There is also a very poignant monument to a young British Army doctor who died whilst treating people during the terrible cholera outbreak of 1865.Winston ChurchillMemorial to Albert EinstenHowever my favourite place to visit in Valletta is the National War  Museum down at Fort St Elmo. I enjoyed it so much  I’ve decided to do a separate posting on it. There are some lovely coffee shops in Valletta and we were pleased to find one, Caffe Cordina, that we had visited about 12 years ago. Reminded me of the Lyons Corner House cafes my Nanna took me to when I was little. Fabulous coffee and sumptuous cakes. Nice to see some things don’t change.My shopping habits don’t change much even on holiday. I was having a quick browse in a book shop and I came across a book which was number 1 in the Malta book sales charts called The Information Officer. Now I was drawn to the book title because that was my job title when I worked in the Careers Service. The book was by Mark Mills and needless to say it had nothing to do with the Careers Service! It was set in  Malta during the Second World War and tells the tale of a very different type of information officer. Here’s a summary:  For the people of Malta, suffering daily bombing raids, the British are the last line of defence against the Nazis. And it is Max Chadwick's job as the information officer to ensure the news the islanders receive maintains morale. So when Max is given proof suggesting a British officer is murdering local women, he knows the consequences of discovery are dire. With the violence on the war-ravaged island escalating daily, he embarks on a private investigation, hidden from the eyes of superiors, friends and the woman he loves. But Max finds himself torn between patriotic duty and personal honour in his efforts to track down the killer! An elusive figure always one step ahead of his hunter.   I’ve checked on it in our local library. It’s out on loan at the moment but I've ordered it! If it's any good I'll do a post on it. Update - Here's the review   Back to the present, we saw a huge amount of renovation and new building work going on in the area around Valletta. There’s no doubt Valetta will benefit greatly from it. One thing that impressed me is that many of the new buildings we saw are totally in keeping with the traditional architectural style and materials of Valletta. New Buildings Around VallettaMany beautiful old cities in the UK have been ruined by the planners total disregard for their city’s heritage and we have to bear some of the blame for our apathy. However I've read on some Maltese websites that there seems to be some criticism and disagreements about the current development of Valletta. One development that caused disagreement a number of years ago, was when the original city gate was removed to improve the traffic flow. Sadly it was replaced by a very mundane looking gate and I have to say it does seem out of place in this very beautiful old city.I mentioned earlier there was more than one harbour, here's a view looking over Marsamxett Harbour, you can see the difference between Valletta and the tourist resort of Sliema opposite Valletta. I've never been to that part and have to say I've no fancy for it. Give me the traditional buildings any day.Looking out over Marsamxett Harbour to SliemaAs long as people continue to voice their feelings, hopefully Valletta will be developed with consideration for its World Heritage status. It would be sad if it lost this.  Now I just have to try and book a holiday in Malta, I really need to see more of lovely Valletta and this beautiful island.Post 124"},

I know I'll probably regret it but I just couldn't be bothered. Sacrilege!We enjoyed having our breakfast here on the back of the ship and lingered for ages.It was too tempting to just sit on deck and come back here again for lunch. Well when you live in a climate like ours you don't get the chance to relax and eat outside very often.Here's a photo taken as we approached Santorini.Santorini was called Strogli in ancient times and is considered to be one of the most beautiful islands in the world. It's the most southern of the Cyclades Islands and  and is the remnant of a volcanic crater that was enclosed by the sea. The  giant central lagoon, more or less rectangular, measures about 12 km × 7 km (7.5 mi × 4.3 mi) and is surrounded by 300 m (980 ft) high steep cliffs on three sides. The island slopes downward from the cliffs to the surrounding Aegean Sea. The water in the centre of the lagoon is nearly 400 m (1,300 ft) deep and makes it a safe harbour for all kinds of shipping. The island's harbours all lie in the lagoon and there are no ports on the outer perimeter of the island; the capital, Fira, clings to the top of the cliff looking down on the lagoon. (Source Wiki)The volcano is still active and the last eruption was in 1956.The population of Santorini is about 14,000 (that's apart from the tourists). Fira (also known as Thira or Thera) is the island's capital and is perched 900 feet up on the cliffs overlooking the harbour. Could you fancy living at the top of that? I couldn't.I also didn't fancy riding a donkey to the top, poor little things. There was a funicular and there's also a road with steps you can see zig zagging to the top at the centre of the photo.You can climb it on foot too but there's over 550 steps. Can you imagine it?Later that day I met someone at reception asking for an elastoplast. He had been climbing the steps and fell in the donkey poo!

Hard to believe some days, but we made it.What a change to the day we got married. The weather was pretty similar, very clear and sunny, just not quite so hot that day. What we didn't have this time was all the hassle. It was such a lovely relaxing day, just the two of us.It was a time to reflect too on how much has happened over those years. The sad things and the happy ones; the family members we've lost and our new family members.In the morning we went up to church, the one we, well I, always go to when we're in Rhodes. I've been there a lot so it's feeling very familiar now. Here's a slightly better photo of the St Francis mural. Still not a really good photo.Then we did our usual wandering around the Old Town. People always wonder why we go back to the same place when there are so many different places in the world to to see. Well I used to think that too, however I have to say I always see something new when we go to Rhodes and I also get a feeling of coming to a very friendly place, one I love.Here's the memorial to the Jewish martyrs of Rhodes and those murdered in the death camps by the Nazis. I've never seen this before and I know we've passed down this street almost every time we've been here at the same time on a Sunday morning. I think the reason why we saw it this time is that there were very few people about this time as we walked down the street. Normally it's packed. Sorry the picture's not too clear but you get the feeling of the place. In the middle of a hustling bustling town, here's a little oasis of peace and tranquility.Here's something else we saw for the first time, a lady making carpets in the front of a shop. A dying trade apparently if you pardon the pun.The street traders were out in force trying to persuade you to buy. Not harassing you, just telling you about the craft and the bargains.I love taking pictures of works in progress!I've noticed that when I'm wandering about I love seeing pictures through doorways, archways and holes like this. Not sure why. Here's a view through a hole in the old city walls.Wonder if it was a place the Knights of St John kept watch from.One of the good things about visiting Rhodes on a cruise we discovered is how close the ship docks to the town. It's just a few minutes walk to the Old and New Towns. Also it gives you a different perspective on the Town too.Here are the walls of the Old Town from the sea, well some of them.This is a view of the New Town and harbour, the other side of the photograph I took in May.  Here's the photo I took from the quayside in May.A view of the top of the harbour. I'm pretty sure that's Turkey you can see in the distance.While I remember, here's a photo of the ship we travelled on. It wasn't one of those mega ships, I would have hated that. Just a nice size only 580 passengers and it was full.  It could get into the smaller docks that the big cruise ships can't.They were always washing and painting it when the ship docked. I kept wondering if the Queen was due on board as you can always smell fresh paint when she's expected anywhere.Santorini tomorrow!Post 121"},
{"title": "Mykonos", "date": "Thursday 8 October 2009", "text": "After lunch the ship docked in Mykonos, just a few nautical miles from Delos.    I’d never been to Mykonos before, (we don’t get direct flights from our local airport)  but I’ve seen all those lovely photos in the holiday brochures. It’s one of the smallest islands in the Cyclades, 16km (10 miles) by 11 km (7 miles) but one of the most popular holiday resorts in Greece.We didn't venture any further than Mykonos Town where there was plenty to see. There are gleaming white washed houses and shops in a maze of narrow haphazard alleyways, well preserved windmills and lots of tiny churches. Designer shops and the usual tourist tat. It’s exactly like the postcards.The bay is really a pretty sight with the Venetian style balconies overhanging the restaurants and cafes. In earlier days these were the distinguished houses of ship captains. I love this photo, the water was crystal clear.The famous windmills of Mykonos are reminders of an earlier time when wind power was used to grind the island's grain. It's not easy to get a decent picture of them, they must specially organise the post card photo shoots. To the rear is a car park and I couldn't resist taking this photo of a car that's much dirtier than mine has ever been and it does get quite mucky. Shows how hot and dusty it is there.Clean Me!In front of the windmills was a huge skip. I managed to get a photo to the side of it and cropped most of it off and also someone's motor scooters.There are apparently 365 churches and chapels on Mykonos but I only took this one photo of a little chapel sandwiched between shops, houses and restaurants.In the fifties, a group of migrating pelicans passed over Mykonos and apparently left behind a single exhausted bird, Petros. Vassilis the fisherman, nursed it back to health and locals say the pelican in the harbour is the original Petros. It's doubtful after all this time and there are several lurking around. This one seemed to be performing its ablutions in an appropriate place, the local loos!Petros?There were numerous alleyways with tiny shops and houses. It was great to find some shade there. You couldn't really get lost though, it wasn't that big.There were lots of lovely little shingley coves and sandy beaches where you could swim. Oh the heat! Wish I had taken my swimming costume. Just in case you're wondering, no that isn't our ship in the background. It was in Delos when we were there too.Next stop Rhodes!Post 120"},
{"title": "The Cruise!", "date": "Monday 5 October 2009", "text": "Our Ruby wedding anniversary was coming up in September so I decided that this time around I wasn’t conforming and having the party everyone expected. I’d done that first time around with the wedding. I’m not one for fuss so a wedding was quite stressful for me especially as my Mam was seriously ill at the time.I decided that this time we were going away, just the two of us and doing something extravagant. So I booked a Mediterranean cruise, I’d always fancied a cruise but had never been able to justify the spending. Eric almost had a heart attack when I told him but he soon came around to the idea.  At the beginning of September we flew to Athens via Heathrow’s Terminal 5 and contrary to all the publicity it’s absolutely brilliant. We spent the night in Piraeus and then on Friday 4 September we boarded the ship. Wow I was amazed at how fantastic the ship was and they showed us to a lovely open air restaurant on the terrace at the back of the ship for lunch. Note I don't use the correct nautical terms! I have to say I was surprised at how fantastic the food was for the whole of the cruise, needless to say I didn’t skimp for the whole time.I was looking forward to taking some really great photographs on this trip but when we got back I was disappointed at the quality of a lot of the photographs and I have no idea why. You’d imagine that given the wonderful Mediterranean light the pictures would be better than ones taken at home. Some were excellent but others weren’t and I haven’t a clue why. Maybe I need to take some photography classes!   The first morning, Saturday 5 September, the ship was at Delos.The light was wonderful and the sky was a fantastic shade of blue. It was a great view to look out on and eat breakfast. Come to think of it we ate lunch looking out there too Delos is an uninhabited island in the roughly circular ring of Greek islands called the Cyclades. It had a position as a holy as a holy sanctuary for a millennium before Olympian Greek mythology made it the birthplace of Apollo and Artemis. In 1990, UNESCO inscribed Delos on the World Heritage List, citing it as the \"exceptionally extensive and rich\" archaeological site which \"conveys the image of a great cosmopolitan Mediterranean port\".     However I’m a bit of a Philistine, not desperately keen on ancient history so I decided to give it a miss. In addition it was scorching hot and there was no shelter at all on the island. I saved my strength for Mykonos later that afternoon!So I've cheated and borrowed some photos from Wiki Commons to see what I missed.Yes, I know, I really should have gone on that visit!Post 119"},

{"title": "We’ve Been to the Beach!", "date": "Wednesday 12 August 2009", "text": "Well it was a fine day and we don’t get too many of these when the tide is right for a beach visit.   It was my husband’s day off and he’s been talking about taking our grandchildren fishing on the rocks off the beach where he grew up. Until we were married he lived in a Northumberland coastal village called Seaton Sluice. It has a small very old harbour and an enormous beach with beautiful golden sands.It’s only about a half hour drive but it was about 10 degrees cooler and much windier at the beach than it was at home. Still they enjoyed it but it wasn’t long before we headed off for lunch. Humungous plates of fish and chips! What else?After that we headed for the beach proper where Lauren wanted to build sandcastles. Well as a child who had built more sandcastles than these two have had hot dinners I gave them the benefit of my extensive sandcastle expertise and advised them that you can’t build a sandcastle with a moat on dry sand.  They would need to build it on the wet sand nearer the sea.  Well an hour later after lugging water from the sea up to the dry sand and finding it just drained away, the penny dropped and they gave up!  Don’t children ever listen? No, because Nanna’s know nothing!Time for a paddle!It was very sunny but with the wind, it wasn’t exactly hot. Funny how they don’t feel it, they thoroughly enjoyed themselves and I had to drag them out of the water.Next it was burying in the sand time. Strange how children still do all the things we did when we went to the beach over fifty years ago. Maybe they were doing it a hundred years ago.  They’re not really that different to us after all!On the way back through the dunes we passed a remnant of the war. At the start of the war the beaches were closed off with barbed wire to repel any potential German invasion. Here’s a photo of the remnant of a pillbox. They were composed of concrete-slabs or filled bags, some held anti tank guns others accommodated soldiers with rifles. The pill boxes formed part of a line of defence along the coast.That must have been awful for local families whose only summer leisure would have been going to the beach.I lived in another coastal town and the beach was just down the road from our primary school. Despite dire warnings from my Mam about not going onto the beach after school, we often did. How sad that children during the war were robbed of this simple pleasure. They had very little else.Well the forecast is good for tomorrow (that’s if the Met Office haven’t boobed again) we’re off to the beach where I used to roam after school. Happy days are here again!Post 114NOTEI've been fiddling around with the layout of the blog because I've been having so many problems with the photographs. I've tried widening the space for the text to allow me to paste the code for the photos directly into the blog so that I don't need to use the Blogger photo insert.

I think it’s a lot to do with Hank Marvin’s guitar intro, once it starts I’m gone,  I really fill up.    To be honest, the film wasn’t much good, but when you’re 16 you’re not bothered are you? All you want to see and hear is your favourite singer.  I saw lots of rubbish teen films in the 'sixties, not many had great music though.  He certainly was a great looking lad and a good singer too. Have to say I was also mad about his backing group, The Shadows. Went to see them even when they weren’t with Cliff Richard.  They were fantastic and still are!It’s over fifty years since their careers started and it’s so hard to believe they’re in their seventies now. They’ve aged so well!   I must be mad because when they publicised their 2009 Farewell Tour last year, I didn’t get tickets. I kept thinking, just remember them as they were, so many singers and groups are past their sell by dates and really should have given up. I won’t mention any names!   Then I realised Cliff and The Shadows are just as good as they ever were. However the venues are all sold out and all you can buy are black market tickets.

{"title": "Durham", "date": "Friday 7 August 2009", "text": "Durham CathedralThis is where I've been today. How lucky am I?It's my favourite place on earth, Durham Cathedral. I didn't go in, I just wandered around the riverside. I'll save my trip inside for another day. For today, I took a walk along memory lane.About twenty five years ago, I used to work in Durham City in the Careers Office on the riverside, overlooking the Cathedral. This was the view! If I was going into a meeting, I made sure I got there early to get a seat facing the window overlooking the Cathedral. Well if I got bored, I could always take in the view! Must have been the best view from any office in the whole of England!In the summer holidays, a friend and I, when we didn't have to be in school all day, (we were careers advisers), used to take our sandwiches down to the riverbank and sit, relax and take in the view. It was so peaceful and we often saw little water rats running about. Other times we'd walk up to the Cathedral and just sit.Today it was especially quiet. Hard to believe as you're about two minutes from the shops and traffic and you can't hear anything other than the river.River Wear looking to Framwellgate BridgeIf you're ever in Durham, just take a walk along the river bank, it's wonderful. It's a bit more overgrown than I remembered, but as you see hardly anyone goes there, even in the middle of the summer holidays. Peace, perfect peace!Bill Bryson in Notes From a Small Island, wrote about Durham:\"...it's wonderful - a perfect little city - and I kept thinking:\"Why did no one tell me about this?\"I knew of course that it had a fine Norman cathedral but I had no idea it was so splendid. I couldn't believe that not once in twenty years had anyone said to me, \"You've never been to Durham? Good God, man, you must go at once! Please take my car.\"I had read countless travel pieces in Sunday papers about weekends away in York, Canterbury, Norwich, even Lincoln, but I couldn't remember reading a single one about Durham, and when I asked friends about it, I I found hardly any who had ever been there.So let me say it now, if you have never been to Durham, go at once. Take my car. It's wonderful.Now I haven't got Bill Bryson's address for you ask to borrow his car, but he's the Chancellor of Durham University, (you can see he really did fall in love with the place) so just address any requests to Durham University, I'm sure they'll find him!Post 112Now can anyone tell me why these photos don't enlarge when I've added them in exactly the same way as the ones that do? Blogger? Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!UpdateGot some information from Abe Lincoln and so I reduced one of the photos to see if that would work.

In case you ever needed proof that knitting is good for you, here’s the story.Nearly 200 people between 70 and 89 took part in the study. The results showed that regularly taking part in craft activities such as knitting or patchwork can reduce memory loss by 40%.It appears that watching hours of television increases the risk of memory loss, so to make the most of knitting’s essential benefits, switch off the telly and stick with the knitting.The UK’s Alzheimer’s Society has come to similar conclusions, and believes that certain activities, including knitting, can enable the brain to develop reserve brain connections that can delay dementia.Well now you can justify all that stuff you buy. No need for excuses, you have a valid reason. \"Oh no pet, I'm not wasting money, I'm staving off demenentia\"!I got this information from Coats Craft website. There are some great free  knitting, crochet, cross stitch and sewing patterns there.Another good site I found lots of good stuff on was All About You.

{"title": "Mixomawhat?", "date": "Sunday 2 August 2009", "text": "Photo Source: Wiki CommonsI can't believe it? My daughter's rabbits have got myxomatosis.I've never heard of pet rabbits getting it and I thought that it had disappeared in the 'fifties. I remembered hearing about it when I was little and how 95% of the wild rabbit population was wiped out.Well it hasn't disappeared which shows how much I know! I would have thought there would have been something on the news or in the countless animal care  programmes we watch but I've never heard a whisper.Apparently it's spread by fleas and mosquitoes so pet rabbits need to be vaccinated.So why didn't the vet mention this? We had rabbits for years when my children were little and it was never mentioned. They're usually pretty quick on the uptake about vaccinations for pets.The vet said they'd been very unlucky as it's quite rare for pet rabbits with no contact with wild ones to catch it. My daughter keeps an eye on them all the time so she knew immediately that one of them wasn't well, the second one had no symptoms but will obviously be infected.It's still in the very early stages so the vet is treating the secondary infections as the virus itself isn't the killer. She said she doesn't normally see them with so few symptoms so it was worth trying to save them. However she said they could just decline quickly and they need to be watched a lot.Just hope they are OK.Post 110"},
{"title": "Old Rhodes Town", "date": "Wednesday 22 July 2009", "text": "I'm a bit late posting this, our holiday was in June, but better late than never!My favourite part of Rhodes is the Old Town, Palia Poli. It's a World Heritage site and it's a fantastic historic place to visit, full of atmosphere.My photos are in no particular order here, just as I posted them. They should enlarge if you click them, but who knows what mood Blogger is in!You can enter through about ten different gates around the 4 kms of defensive walls built by The Knights of St John mainly as a defence against threats of Turkish invasion in the 1450s.The dry moat surrounds the Old Town and for many years it was strewn with rubbish but now most of it is landscaped and is a pleasant place to walk. There are also stone missiles piled up there!One of the Gates into Old Rhodes TownThis gate on the north east side of the Old Town leads from Mandraki Harbour. It's a very busy one, always lots of cars.Mandraki HarbourInside this medieval city there's a mix of Hellenistic, Roman, Byzantine and Moorish buildings in a medieval warren of streets, lanes, alleyways and courtyards.One of my favourite streets it the Ippoton, Street of the Knights. You can see it through the arch on the photo below.Archway leading to the Street of the KnightsIt's a lovely cobbled street restored by the Italians and now occupied by municipal and cultural organisations. The Knights were organised by country of origin and by their language into national groups called Tongues. Each Tongue had its own \"Inn\" where the knights lived and you can still see the coats of arms above the doorways.  It's a very sedate street now probably nothing like the medieval one that would have been teeming with life. It's also hard on the feet walking on those cobbles in hot weather, best to use the path if you can.Ippoton - The Street of the KnightsThe Palace of the Grand Masters was the lavish home of the leaders of the crusades. It was used as a prison when the Turks took over, after that it fell into ruins and was destroyed by an explosion in 1856.Palace of the Grand MastersArchway in the Palace of the Grand Masters  I took this picture of one of the many canons in the Palace of the Grand Masters.  It had a British coat of arms but it was from 19th Century.Looking over the walls from the Palace of the Grand MastersLooking Through the Koskinou GateThe Church of Saint John was also destroyed by the explosion that wrecked the Palace of the Grand Masters. You can recognise the totally different Italian style and it's now under reconstruction. The photo below shows I really need a wide angle lens to do it justice. nChurch of Saint JohnI'm pretty sure this is the Mosque of Suleiman but wouldn't swear to it.I'll check in September! I can't remember which church this was. There's lots!Ruins of  Temple of Aphrodite These date from the 3rd century BC, one of the few ancient remains to be found in the Old Town.Some ruins! Now it would be nice if they would provide some information about what these ruins are. The only sign around shown in the photo below, says Byzantine Fortifications but that refers to the walls in the photo below! Byzantine FortificationsOne of the many archwaysJust take a look at this weathering!There are so many parts of the Old Town in the process of renovation and you can just wander about quite safely along the back streets snapping away.A typical little back street courtyardHow about renovating this?or maybe this?Here's a place that's well on the way to being completed. It has a sort of Italian look about this with the wooden shutters and balcony. That drooping wire has me a bit worried! What health and safety regs are being broken there?The street below is Sokratous Street, the main shopping street in the Old Town. Tacky as you'll find anywhere but absolutely charming! I love it.Normally on a Sunday at the end of May it's absolutely heaving. The day we were there it was pretty quiet. A sign of the drop in tourists in May this year.Sokratous StreetI love this square and fountain, not sure what it's called.  If you've seen film, Escape to Athena you'll remember it! It's usually packed but it was quite peaceful the day we were there.I really like this square, there are lots of restaurants and cafes here too. No water in the fountain though!I love this walk along past numerous cafes and restaurants. The banter from the waiters trying to get you to to eat or drink is wonderful. They always make me laugh. Totally different from the ones who hassle you in some countries. If you click on the photo you can see a dog lying in front of a cafe and the suit of armour. No it wasn't dead, just relaxing in the heat!We're going on a Mediterranean cruise for our Ruby wedding anniversary in September.  The day we visit Rhodes is on our anniversary so we'll be back in the Old Town again. This time instead of just wandering about and snapping what takes my fancy, I'll be a bit more organised and plan what to see. Then maybe I'll remember the names.Post 109"},
{"title": "My Latest Fad!", "date": "Sunday 19 July 2009", "text": "Inspired by Rudee's gorgeous shawl, the idea of knitting one started to grow in my mind. I've always loved shawls and lace knitting but I've never knitted one. My fine lacy knitting has been confined to little baby matinee coats. I always finished them!I had managed to get over my urges to buy wool, and lots of it, when all the wool shops around me closed. I bought loads of it and there's still quite a hoard of it in the black hole cupboard under the stairs. Every now and again I get it out, look at it, think what I could do with it, then put virtually everything back. I have knitted quite a bit of it over the years but there's still a lot of guilt about the money just lying there. Yes another one of my guilty pleasures which I thought I had got over.Now that I've been reading people's blogs about their hoards of fabrics, wools and other stuff I don't feel quite as bad. They call it a stash. Doesn't sound anything like as bad as my hoard of unused stuff. In fact it sounds a really positive thing.I'm tempted to get all of it out and display it in my shelving unit in the spare bedroom. It would look quite nice, a bit like a wool shop that I've never had the pleasure of going into for years. There just aren't any here now. Problem is everyone would see it! I say everyone, I really mean my husband. He knows there is quite a lot of stuff in there but as it's spread out and in various bags, it doesn't look so bad. I'll just leave it there!Have to say I enjoyed browsing about on the Internet looking at all the beautiful lace shawl patterns and the scrumptious wools on the various sites. I got totally absorbed with it looking at the fabulous colours of that lace wool. Main problem was I wanted to feel it.Eventually I decided to make this one. It's not the mammoth one that Rudee is making but I'm hoping I can manage it. If I do, I get the feeling this may become a habit. Oh the pleasure I got out of looking at the lace wool on all those websites doesn't bear thinking about for too long. It takes all sorts doesn't it!I got the pattern here from Knitty and really enjoyed reading about how it was designed. It's called an Aeolian shawl and apparently the inspiration came from aeolian erosion in the Mohave desert! Well whatever takes your fancy.Next I had to research where to get the lace wool. Most Internet suppliers seem to be in the USA but I did find one down in Wales. This is the odd bit. Yes, I know it's a wool website and the idea is you order there, but the colour I wanted was out of stock, so I decided to ring up to have a chat about it.The lady was really lovely, her two children had just broken up from school and I could hear them chattering in the background. She was really helpful but the shade I wanted, shades of deep blue, won't be available for a few weeks. She did have my second choice, variegated shades of lilacs and blues, so I went with that. I consoled myself with the thought that it might be easier on the eyes to knit the lighter coloured wool! It's an age thing.What was really surprising was it worked out cheaper than ordering over the website. Weird that!Now I'm dying to get my hands on the wool, it looks so gorgeous. However I'm dreading my husband's comments if he's here when it's delivered. I'll have to hang around the front door tomorrow!Just hope I'm not biting off more than I can chew as they say. The pattern is knitted with a circular needle which is not one my favourite things to use. In years gone by I've used them for yokes on fair isle sweaters and was glad to get them finished. The pattern is composed of various charts which I need to print out. Probably easier to keep your place with them than following rows of written instructions. You can mark them at the side to keep a tally of how far you've got. The other thing I've never done is that soaking and blocking of lace. Sounds a bit daunting but I'm up for the challenge. I've also got lots of babysitting to do over the school holidays so maybe knitting will help me keep my sanity if the monsoon weather returns.In the meantime I'm getting on with my long overdue mailart cross stitch project for Michelle. Got to finish that before I start the shawl.Can't wait for the Open to finish, it's been on all day and it's near the nail biting end but I have to get off to church now. You'd think I was a golf fan. I'm not, but it's been an interesting afternoon. Will it be Westwood or Watson? I'll find out later.Post 107"},

I went to look at the blog updates and now I've got this message on my Dashboard:I'm almost frightened to say this but click to enlarge the picture if you can't read the text!Now just wait a minute!What about all those lovely blogs I've been following for the past 10 months? Have I been imagining them? Maybe it's a Dallas moment and I've been dreaming like Bobby Ewing for all that time? Well that would be OK because if that's the case, I obviously haven't been on holiday yet. Still got something to look forward to. Well was that trip to Rhodes part of the dream too? If so it was a blooming good one.Did I have a moment of complete madness and delete them? No, I'm not that doolally yet.No it's all too real this problem and it hasn't gone away. I've been in and out of Google a couple of times and yes, they've all gone.I was horrified that I might have to start searching for all the blogs I follow. I know I'd never remember them all.Anyway I've just checked my Blog and thank goodness the updates are still showing on the right hand side. Phew!Now if they come back I'll make a list of them and also the urls so if they disappear and the side of the blog stops updating I'll still be able to find them.Is this what they call Disaster Planning?What on earth is going on?Come on Blogger, for pity's sake, get a grip before you really do send me doolally tap altogether!"},
{"title": "What's the Definition of a Heatwave?", "date": "Monday 29 June 2009", "text": "No, it's not one of those jokes.Apparently the Met Office has issued a heatwave warning for England and Wales and the Department of Health has asked people to check on elderly friends and family. NHS staff have also been warned to prepare for a surge of elderly and ill patients suffering from the heat.And what sort of temperatures are we expecting?Well wait for it........In London, the temperature will rise steadily from about 29C on Sunday to about 32C by the end of the week. Yippeee!!!What about the rest of us? Well supposedly in the rest of UK, temperatures will climb from about 22C to about 29C. Note my scepticism, I say supposedly because this doesn't marry up with the weather here in the North East today and the BBC weather forecast for the rest of the week.Anyway, come on, is that really what you call a heatwave? I would say it has to get above 30C and I'm pretty positive I've never experienced that here in the North East. Maybe 28 or 29F for a day!So what is a heatwave?I was surprised to find that there is no accepted definition of a heatwave.There is no universal definition of a heat wave and the term is relative to the usual weather in the area or local threshold. The definition recommended by the World Meteorological Organization is when the daily maximum temperature of more than five consecutive days exceeds the average maximum temperature by 5 °C, the normal average period being 1961 to 1990 (which corresponds to the UK baseline of thirty years). Source: UK Climate ProjectionsSo by this definition it really only constitutes a \"heatwave\" in the London area. Have to ask, does that really constitute a UK heatwave?Bill Bryson was right when he says he's bewildered by the British attitude to the weather. If you've read Notes From a Small Island you may remember how he describes our tendency to suffer from hyperbole in relation to the weather. Yes, we certainly do exaggerate the slight deviations from the weather norms. \"Somebody\" also assumes that if it happens in London, that's the whole of the UK.What's the temperature today here in the North East of England? Well according to the BBC it's a high of 16C, 61F, it's grey and cloudy. Oooh I'm sweltering. Don't think so!!!!! What's on the cards for tomorrow? Sunny intervals and a huge 18C, 66F. Whey hey!The highest temperature this week? Wednesday more sunny intervals with a massive 19C, 68F. Oh my goodness, don't think I can cope with that heat!Well I just can't wait for this heatwave. Better get my bathing costume out and the sun cream and dash out to buy a fan of some description to cool me down or I'll get heatstroke. I'll not go mad and get a quote for the swimming pool just yet. I'll wait for the global warming to take effect. Well they're forecasting that the water level will rise and London will be submerged. So it's lifebelts and rubber dinghies all round then?I assume it's the best weather we're going to get this summer so I'd better make the most of it.Post 103"},
{"title": "Rhodes Flora", "date": "Saturday 27 June 2009", "text": "When I go abroad another of the things I like to do, apart from looking at churches is looking at the different flowers and trees.Rhodes has such a warm climate in comparison to England's so the flowers and trees do vary a lot and I see things I certainly don't at home. I live in the North East of England so there are plants and trees that won't grow there even though they do in the warmer South of England.I love the bushes that grow all around the hotel we stay at. I have no idea what they are called but they are gorgeous and are shades of pink and white.If anyone knows their name I'd be pleased if you would let me know.Update - Jeanette has told me they are called Oleander, many thanks for this information.If you click the photographs they should enlarge now. See my Update at the end of the posting to find out about this.More white ones. Some of the bushes grow really high and form a lovely hedge on the entrance to the hotel which has been designed along the lines of the medieval town of Rhodes. The day before I took this picture the border on the left below the trees was full of lovely flowers. Unfortunately the gardeners had taken them all out the night before to replant.Here are some more on the left of the picture just inside the hotel grounds. Near the entrance there's a lovely little chapel and again there are lots of these lovely floral bushes/trees around it. I didn't notice at the time but the clouds in the background are lovely. We didn't see many of those in the two weeks we were there!I love that little chapel although I've never seen anyone there. I know this posting is about the flora but I'll show you a picture of the inside of the chapel. It's always been locked when I've been there so I had to take it from a window in the door which I pushed open to peep in. The painting is absolutely amazing, the colours are really beautiful. Just look at that beautiful evening sky painted on the ceiling.I assume it was built for weddings at the hotel but they tend to go to other places such as the Kalithea Roman Spa. The entrance to the refurbished Spa is in the photo below. It's very nice too but it has no religious aspect to it. However I assume lots of people nowadays just want a civil ceremony.Incidentally the Spa has been the set for a number of films. The main one I remember was Escape to Athena a comic WW11 film which had a number of stars in it, Roger Moore, Stephanie Powers, Telly Savalas, David Niven, Claudia Cardinale, Elliot Gould, Sonny Bono, Ricard Roundtree and Anthony Valentine. I've seen it a few times and although it's thirty years old I really like it. I especially love looking at the bits filmed in and around the Spa.I've digressed yet again!My grandchildren call these the pineapple trees. I assume they are some kind of palm.They really do look like huge pineapples.Look here's a pineapple forest! Lovely! Now this one I know. I just wish I could grow geraniums like these and it was only mid May when I took this photo. Even by August mine don't look as big as this. There were lots of plants with flowers like tubular bells. Here are the red ones. And here are the lemon ones. They looked so pretty cascading down over the walls. Now this one I think I know. It's possibly bougainvillea. Here it is again below a \"pineapple\" tree. Who says pink and red don't go together? This looks a bit like the hibiscus that has sadly died off in my garden this summer.Now these are really lovely trees with beautiful blue blossoms. Again I have no idea what they are.Update - Michelle has advised me that these are Jacaranda. What a great name! She said that the ones that flower are female trees.Here's a closer view of the blossoms. I've seen this before on my friend's balcony on the Costa Brava. Again I don't know what it is.Update - Jeanette has told me this is another bougainvillea.One thing I haven't mentioned is the gorgeous smell that greets you late evening and in the mornings, the smell of jasmine is absolutely wonderful. There were lots of lovely bushes and plants on our patio. The jasmine I recognised but the bush next to it had red fluffy flowers. Unfortunately I didn't take a photo as soon as we got there. By the time I took this most of the fluffy bits had dropped off. I'm missing these lovely flowers and the blue skies you see in the pictures. Well you can't have lush green lawns like we have if you have sunshine all day every day and no rain can you. Never mind I'm sure I'll be back again before too long.Update - Recently I can't understand why my photos don't enlarge when you click on them. I was sure that I have been inserting them in the same way so had no idea what was going on. Today I think I know what has happened but I have no idea why Blogger is so inconsistent with image insertion.I've been having a lot of problems with formatting text and photographs and so I decided to centre the photographs when I inserted them. This resolved the problem of the text jumping about when I centred the photographs after inserting them. However I think this is stopping the photos enlarging.In desperation this afternoon when I inserted photographs I didn't choose a layout and centred it afterwards. I had the problem with the text again but surprisingly the photos now enlarge. Eureka! What a weird system Blogger is. Why doesn't it give you any information about this anywhere?Update to the Update - I'm just about losing the will to live with this! Myra contacted me to say that she can enlarge her photos even if she chooses to centre them from the layout screen.I've just tried it on a test posting and she's right, they do enlarge. So why didn't they last week when I was doing this posting and on my posting about Michelle's Mailart? They still don't on that one.Give me strength! Arghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!Post 102"},
{"title": "Thank You Michelle!", "date": "Thursday 25 June 2009", "text": "A while ago I was looking at Michelle's website and saw her Mailart swap.It seemed very interesting and I decided to join it.Well this is what Michelle sent me. Isn't it lovely! This is Michelle's picture of the mailart before she posted it. Can you see the two lovely little ladybirds? The detail is amazing and the stitches are really perfect. I was hoping that if you clicked on the pictures they would enlarge and you could see the detail but it doesn't seem to work. Now I have no idea why this works sometimes and on other occasions it doesn't if you are doing the same thing. Maybe it's a Blogger quirk. If anyone can enlighten me I'd be grateful. The size of the photos are quite large apart from this little one below, so not sure why it isn't working. Here is my photograph with the stamp and postmark. Here's the reverse. Look at the lovely ribbon tie.Just look at what's inside. The lining is a lovely red design.Amongst the lovely goodies there's a gorgeous tiny little ladybird pendant which is from Delos. Hope you can see it just above the greetings card form Michelle.What a fantastic present this was from Michelle, thank you so much.Why not take a look at Michelle's website and see some of her fantastic sewing skills.Now I'm worried that my mailart won't be up to this standard. I'll just have to do my best!Post No 101"},
{"title": "Let’s Do It!", "date": "Monday 15 June 2009", "text": "I've just noticed that this is my 100th posting. I'm not exactly a prolific Blogger. I tend to post when I have something to say or to share. So here's what I have to say today and to share with you.I’m suffering from post holiday blues as you so often do when forcing yourself to adjust to reality. The reality of being like a hamster in a treadmill, shopping, washing, ironing, cleaning the bathroom, hoovering, cooking, clearing up and so on and so on.....For some reason it feels worse than when I had to go back to work after a holiday. Well I did like my job, I don't like housework!!!!So I need a laugh!My motto is, \"When in need of a laugh, watch Victoria Wood!\"So here’s one of my all time favourites, The Ballad of Barry and Freda, Let’s Do It!Look out for a very young, curly haired, Julie Walters in the audience.The Ballad of Barry and Freda - Victoria WoodJust in case you can't understand all of the lyrics, here they are:Freda and Barry sat one night.The sky was clear.The stars were bright.The wind was soft.The moon was up.Freda drained her cocoa cup.She licked her lips.She felt sublime.She switched off Gardeners' Question Time.Barry cringed in fear and dreadAs Freda grabbed his tie, and said:Let's do it!Let's do it,Do it while the mood is right!I'm feelingAppealingI've really got an appetite.I'm on fireWith desire.I could handle half the tenors in a male voice choir.Let's do it!Let's do it tonight!But he said:I can't do it.I can't do it.I don't believe in too much sex.This fashionFor passionTurns us into nervous wrecks.No derision!My decisionI'd rather watch The Spinners on the television.I can't do it.I can't do it tonight.So she said:Let's do it!Let's do it,Do it till our hearts go boom!Go native,CreativeLiving in the living room.This follyIs jolly.Bend me over backwards on me hostess trolley.Let's do it!Let's do it tonight!But he said:I can't do it.I can't do it.Me 'eavy breathing days have gone.I'm older,Feel colder.Other things that turn me on.I'm imploring:I'm boring.Let me read this catalogue on vinyl flooring.I can't do it.I can't do it tonight.So she said:Let's do it!Let's do it,Have a crazy night of love!I'll strip bare.I'll just wearStilettos and an oven glove.Don't starve a Girl of a palaver.Dangle from the wardrobe in your balaclava.Let's do it!Let's do it tonight!But he said:I can't do it.I can't do it.I know I'd only get it wrong.Don't angleFor me to dangle.Me arms 'ave never been that strong.Stop pouting.Stop shouting.You know I pulled a muscle when I did that grouting.I can't do it.I can't do it tonight.Let's do it!Let's do it,Share a night of wild romance,Frenetic,Poetic!This could be your last big chanceTo quote Milton,To eat Stilton,To roll in gay abandon on the tufted Wilton.Let's do it!Let's do it tonight!I can't do it.I can't do it.I've got other little jobs on hand.Don't grouseAround the house.I’ve got a busy evening planned.Stop nagging.I'm flagging.You know as well as I do that the pipes want lagging.I can't do it.I can't do it tonight.Let's do it!Let's do itWhile I'm really in the mood!Three cheers!It's yearsSince I caught you even semi-nude.Be drasticGymnastic.Wear your baggy Y-fronts with the loose elastic.Let's do it!Let's do it tonight!I can't do it.I can't do it.I must refuse to get undressed.I feel silly.It's too chillyTo go without me thermal vest.Don't choose me.Don't use me.Me mother sent a note to say you must excuse me.I can't do it.I can't do it tonight.Let's do it!Let's do it!I feel I absolutely must.I won't exempt you,Want to tempt you,Want to drive you mad with lust.No cautions,Just contortions!Smear an avocado on me lower portions.Let's do it!Let's do it tonight!I can't do it.I can't do it.It's really not my cup of tea.I'm harassed,Embarrassed.I wish you hadn't picked on me.No dramas!Give me me pyjamas.The only girlI'm mad about is Judith Chalmers.I can't do it.I can't do it tonight.Let's do it!Let's do it!I really want to run amok.Let's wiggle.Let's jiggle.Let's really make the rafters rock.Be mighty.Be flighty.Come and melt the buttons on me flameproof nightie.Let's do it!Let's do it tonight!Let's do it!Let's do it!I really want to rant and rave.Let's go,'Cause I knowJust how I want you to behave:Not bleakly,Not meekly.Beat me on the bottom with a Woman's Weekly.Let's do it!Let's do it tonight!Victoria Wood"},
{"title": "Church Going in Rhodes", "date": "Saturday 13 June 2009", "text": "St Francisco Roman Catholic Church, Rhodes TownOne thing I like to do when I go away is to visit the local church. It isn't always easy to find a Roman Catholic Church in Greece but it is in Rhodes Town. There are two! I usually go to this one called the Church of San Francisco, (St Francis) mainly because it's on the bus route from where we stay and there's a bus stop right outside the church.The other church is an older one in the centre of the town near the casino. I had a problem finding it the first time I visited Rhodes and I've never gone back to it. What a luxury finding two churches so close together! It's quite a modern church and it has a huge, wonderful painting of St Francis on the altar. I wanted to take a picture after the service but unfortunately another service followed immediately afterwards so I could only take a picture from the back of the church very quickly. It's quite poor unfortunately, you get the scale of the painting but not the detail. I'll be back in Rhodes in September so maybe I can get a better one then.What I found strange last year was they have started to do the Mass in Latin and with a lot of singing. I'm ashamed to admit I've forgotten most of the Latin I used to know and they didn't have a Mass card in Latin and English, or if they did I didn't get one.There are greeters at the back of the church and they welcome you and give you a sheet with the readings in your language. Not sure they had them for all the nationalities there but the main ones are covered. I don't know why they have gone back to the Mass in Latin but it was quite nice and brought back some memories. The priest sounds like he's from Yorkshire, he's been there for quite a long time but he is quite a serious chap! He speaks a few languages and has a bit of a chat to people in French, Italian, Greek and English which is quite nice.If you go there for Mass be prepared, it starts at 10 am on Sundays but it's quite a bit longer than ours. The last one I went to was nearly an hour and was followed by benediction. The week before it lasted over an hour as there was a local couple renewing their wedding vows after forty years which was quite nice.It's interesting too that the church is also used for Anglican services.Outside the church is a statue of St Francis with the prayer inscribed around it in numerous languages including Hebrew. I did take a photo of the prayer and checked that it was quite clear to read but I can't find it on the camera now. Weird! St Francis of AssisiLord, make me an instrument of Thy peace;where there is hatred, let me sow love;where there is injury, pardon;where there is doubt, faith;where there is despair, hope;where there is darkness, light;and where there is sadness, joy.O Divine Master,grant that I may not so much seekto be consoled as to console;to be understood, as to understand;to be loved, as to love;for it is in giving that we receive,it is in pardoning that we are pardoned,and it is in dying that we are born to Eternal Life.Amen."},

{"title": "Holidays!", "date": "Monday 8 June 2009", "text": "Well I’ve just got back from 2 weeks holiday in Rhodes and never mind trying to recover from an overnight flight and settling back into the old routine, I’m trying to adjust to a different climate altogether. Talk about global warming, well it’s not happening here in England, I’m freezing.I haven’t touched a computer for over 2 weeks and I got back to find that my incoming emails have been rejected due to my email box being full. Guess what? Tiscali didn’t notify me about this until it was about to start rejecting my emails and that was after I had gone on holiday. So apologies to anyone who has contacted me and got their email sent back to them. Now I’m still trying to figure out why the email box was full when I’d deleted all my old emails from Outlook before I went away. I suspect that I also have to delete them again from my Tiscali email account. Well I’ve done that and the account is OK now. What a pain!Well on with the show as they say. I’ve had a fantastic holiday and as usual done very little other than eat, drink, swim, play with my grandchildren and read. I’m not the greatest tourist in the world I’ve been to Rhodes five times now and I’ve seen very little of it. I do love Rhodes Town though, the old one and I always go there and have a wander around the back streets on Sundays after I’ve been to church. I’ll do a posting of that, maybe next week. Old Rhodes TownIn the meantime I’ll describe one of the books I read. I’m not a prolific reader, I never seem to have time but when I’m on holiday I usually manage to read about five or six books.The Island by Victoria Hislop was the one I enjoyed most, it’s one of the best books I’ve read in ages.The novel begins in present day London where Alexis is about to go on holiday and to decide on major changes to her life. She’s going to Plaka in Crete, the place where her mother, Sofia, grew up. Her mother refuses to speak about her past but she gives Alexis a letter to give to an old friend, Fortina who will tell her the story.As she questions her mother’s friend, Alexis uncovers the family secrets and her mother's, her grandmother's, and her great-grandmother's past and their connection with Spinaloga.This island of Spinalonga was Greece's main leper colony from 1903 to 1957 and the book paints an intimate picture of what life was like for the lepers living on the island. It’s a compelling and moving story with vividly drawn characters and the wonderful setting of Crete which she describes in beautiful detail.The book portrays people’s fears and prejudices about leprosy and the hardships of life for those who were stigmatised and banished to Spinalonga. It’s an eye opener and raises awareness about the disease. Although today the disease is totally curable, over 600,000 people are diagnosed with leprosy every year. So if you’re like me and don’t know much about leprosy or how you can help, you can visit the LEPRA website to find out more.I had a couple of reservations about some aspects of the story but on the whole I found it a fascinating book, interesting and well researched and although leprosy is at the centre of the story it’s not all gloom! It’s a heart warming and charming read which I really enjoyed. Even better was the fact it was a bargain, I found it in the Poundland shop!The book made me want to go back to Crete one day and visit Spinalonga to see for myself the setting for the book.In the meantime here’s an interesting video clip of the haunting setting for the book."},
{"title": "Airports - Don't you just love them!", "date": "Sunday 7 June 2009", "text": "We got back from two weeks holiday in Rhodes a few days ago and I'm still feeling totally disoriented and wondering why.We've been there a few times before, have had night flights a couple of times too and on the plus side we weren't delayed this year, I don't have to go to work now but I'm still absolutely shattered and can't get back into any sort of routine. Maybe it seems worse because of how much longer you have to spend in the airport due to security measures, however I'm sure it's partly due to the poor state of Rhodes airport, even though it's a new extension.We were taken to Rhodes airport three hours before the flight was due to be called. Now that's not a problem here, our local airport is OK. It's not exactly Heathrow but it's easy to while away the time in the various cafes, pubs and range of shops before you are called to the embarkation gate. When you are called, you are only in the gate area for a short time, the seats are not that bad and the loos are good. However in Rhodes it's a different story altogether. This year we stood for well over an hour and a half in the check in line. What a shambles! Not an easy thing standing for that long at 1.30 in the morning for anyone, never mind the elderly, disabled and children. There were only four metal seats in the whole of that check in area. One thing that kept us occupied whilst we awaited was wondering whether the woman who literally rolled onto the airport transfer bus would be allowed to board. She was more than half cut and her husband looked a bit the worse for wear too! She wandered around the airport with a large bottle of water looking for goodness knows what and couldn't walk in a straight line. The tour company staff were trying to keep an eye on her but were convinced she wouldn't be allowed to board. People in the queue were all saying they would refuse to sit beside them on the plane, have to say I was a bit worried about that.Due to how long the Rhodes airport staff took to check us in, she managed to look sober and they did let her through. Well they wouldn't want her left in the airport would they! When we got to the gate we then observed a tug o' war between the pair of them over her handbag, not sure why but eventually he left her and she sat down with her water bottle. Luckily they were very quiet and caused no more trouble. She probably went to sleep, I never saw either of them again even at the other end. Maybe she's still sitting there.After you check in you have to go straight to the departure gate, well there's is nothing else to do. Also despite the airport being greatly enlarged, they still only have two small duty free shops, one pathetic cafe and half a dozen appalling loos that I've never seen clean or all working so imagine the queues! The worst thing however is the seating, there isn't enough and people have to sit on the floor. However the seats themselves are disgusting, uncomfortable metal ones that after five minutes you need to get up and walk about to keep your circulation going. Nice way to spend a night!Now I'm sure this airport is bigger than ours in Newcastle, so why can't they provide similar facilities? You feel like they are treating you like goods on a factory line, just processing you through dumping you at the departure gate with no consideration for your level of comfort. It also seems like they're missing a trick on the income side too with having few opportunities to while away the time with retail therapy.I've made my mind up that I'm still going to go to Rhodes, let's face it most airports in the Greek Islands are worse than here. But this is the last time I'll take an overnight flight, no matter how reasonably priced the holiday is!Never mind it was a lovely holiday and I'll post some photos later. Now I must try to catch up on looking at people's blogs, I'm way behind and wondering how everyone is."},
{"title": "To see oursel's as others see us!", "date": "Thursday 4 June 2009", "text": "Well the full Robert Burns Quotation is:“Oh wad some power the giftie gie us,To see oursel's as others see us!It wad frae monie a blunder free us,And foolish notion”Well it's no bad thing, trying to understand how other nationalities view you and I do like a laugh, so I’ve been reading Bill Bryson’s Notes From A Small Island, again! Well here's someone who certainly can let us Brits see ourselves as an American sees us.He’s one of the best authors I’ve come across at making me laugh. The other was David Niven!The first time I came across Bill Bryson was when I told a colleague I was going on holiday to Malta. The next day she handed me a copy of Bill Bryson’s book, Neither Here Nor There: Travels in Europe. Now I know that although she had travelled to lots of countries, but for some reason she had never fancied the idea of going to Malta. She shuddered when I told her I was going. So maybe she thought I would need some cheering up. Now I had always wanted to go to see the island that withstood so much of a battering from the Germans during WW11 that the George Cross was awarded to its people in 1942 for their heroism. My dad had been there too during the war when he was in the Royal Navy and he loved it.After we landed at Luqa airport we stood for quite a long time in the queue at passport control. It appeared that the people working there had just suddenly downed tools and left. At least three planes had come in, German passengers were in front of us and Italians behind us. Still nobody deigned to come and look at our passports. After about 10 minutes I decided to get the book out and start reading to pass the time away.Now I didn’t know what I was letting myself in for with this book. I just packed it in my hand luggage without looking at it. As I read it I realised this was just my kind of humour. I tried to hold my laugh in, smirking, grinning and gritting my teeth, but eventually I couldn’t hold it in and laughed out loud. If you’ve never done this whilst reading a book in a public place, I can tell you it’s very embarrassing. You feel like you’re a bit of a looney, well you can’t exactly share the joke. I was embarrassed and looked up to see if anyone was looking, apart from my husband who had given up on me. Well a German lady was looking and as my eyes caught hers, she smiled and gave me the thumbs up. At least she didn’t think I was a fruit and nutcase. From then on I've been hooked on Bill Bryson's writing!So back to Notes from a Small Island (Great Britain for anyone who hasn’t read it). He has a good understanding of Britain and the British, probably better than most British people! However, what I don’t understand about Bill Bryson is how he can look at all our faults here in Britain and find them endearing. Amazing!I love the record of his nostalgia trip around Britain in 1995, before he returned to live in the USA which is recorded in his book Notes From a Small Island. Things have changed a bit since 1995 but I hope not too much.It’s interesting to see ourselves as others see us and Bill Bryson certainly has the gift of getting you to see how other people see you. When he’s writing about it, it’s more than interesting, it’s thought provoking and often hilarious.Our Attitude to PleasureOne of our peculiar quirks he notes is our attitude to pleasure:\"I used to be puzzled by the British attitude to pleasure, and that tireless, dogged optimism of theirs that allowed them to attach an upbeat turn of phrase to the direst inadequacies – “well, it makes a change”, “mustn’t grumble”, “ you could do worse”, “it’s not much, but it’s cheap and cheerful”, “it was quite nice really” – but gradually I came round to their way of thinking and my life has never been happier.I remember finding myself sitting in damp clothes in a cold café on a dreary seaside promenade and being presented with a cup of tea and a teacake and going “Oooh lovely!”, and I knew then that the process had started. Before long I came to regard all kinds of activities – asking for more toast in a hotel, buying wool-rich socks at Marks and Spencer, getting two pairs of trousers when I only needed one – as something daring, very nearly illicit. My life became immensely richer.\"He’s right you know, we are so easily pleased by the little things here in Britain. It’s probably a throw back to the war years. Those of us who remember sweetie rationing after the war still can’t believe that we can buy unlimited supplies of chocolate. Me, I can’t believe my luck when I get a decent cup of coffee in cafes now, something you take for granted in places like Spain. Even the greasiest spoon café serves fabulous coffee.Communist Britain?Another thing I found fascinating was Bill Bryson’s thoughts about what Britain would have been like under Communism.It has long seemed to me unfortunate – and I’m taking the global view here – that such an important experiment in social organisation was left to the Russians when the British would have managed it so much better. All those things that are necessary to the successful implementation of a rigorous socialist system are, after all, second nature to the British. For a start, they like going without. They are great at pulling together, particularly in the face of adversity, for a perceived common good. They will queue patiently for indefinite periods and accept with rare fortitude the impositioning of rationing, bland diets and sudden inconvenient shortages of staple goods, as anyone who has ever looked for bread at a supermarket on a Saturday afternoon will know. They are comfortable with faceless bureaucracies and, as Mrs Thatcher proved, tolerant of dictatorships. They will wait uncomplainingly for years for an operation or the delivery of a household appliance. They have a natural gift for making jokes about authority without seriously challenging it, and they derive universal satisfaction from the sight of the rich and the powerful brought low. Most of those above twenty five already dress like Eastern Germans. The conditions, in a word, are right.Please understand, I’m not saying that Britain would have been a happier, better place under Communism, merely that the British would have done it properly. They would have taken it in their stride, with good heart, and without excessive cheating. In point of fact, until about 1970 it wouldn’t have made the slightest discernible difference to most people’s lives, and might at least have spared us Robert Maxwell.\"Oh how right you are Bill. We did put up with Mrs Thatcher for far too long, now I have no idea why we did that. Why didn’t we stand and shout outside 10 Downing Street “You’re a monster! You’re selling off all the country's assets to your rich cronies” She really was a monster, but we don’t do that kind of thing. We save the whales, march to stop new airport runways being built and stop children being smacked. What wimps.However I think things are changing here, the media has got hold of what’s become the latest political scandal about the expenses MPs are claiming. Things such as swimming pools, chandeliers and cleaners for their second homes when the rest of us are struggling to hang onto our first ones. People are really incensed by it and yes it’s a disgrace, but it’s not illegal, well not all of the claims, but it is immoral in the current climate. Day after day it goes on and it’s become the main topic of virtually every TV news and discussion programme. The media are feasting on it! So come on Gordon! Just get your act together, reform the expenses and haul those greedy MPs into line before we all die of boredom!Yes, we do stand in queues for hours and expect others to do the same. Well why shouldn’t they if we have to. You’ve probably heard the moaning and whinging when you go on holiday and the Germans or Russians try to jump the queue. Mind you the road rage phenomenon has reared its ugly head since this book was written, so maybe we are changing, a little. For the worse!Another thing I’m not so sure about is the dressing like East Germans bit, but then again I don’t know what East Germans dressed like in 1995. It might have been like those horrendous shell suits that people of all ages, shapes and sizes went mad for here in the ‘nineties. Gross! However I bet it was nothing like the apparel of a couple of fifty plus year olds I saw the other day. They were tattooed and hairy, wearing leather biking gear; Bill didn’t visit Washington, the English one) so maybe we’re the exception to the rule. I've been wittering on here for ages so think I’d better start drawing this to a conclusion and what better topic to finish on than the weather. The favourite topic of conversation of the British.Our attitude to it bewilders Bill! Apparently he carries a weather forecast clipping taken from The Western Daily Mail: \"Outlook: Dry and warm, but cooler with some rain.” As he comments; “There you have in a single pithy sentence the English weather captured to perfection.” (I assume he means British, rather than just English). “To an outsider the most striking thing about the English weather is that there isn’t very much of it at all. All those phenomena that elsewhere give nature an edge of excitement, unpredictability and danger – tornadoes, monsoons, raging blizzards, run-for-your-life hailstorms – are almost wholly unknown in the British Isles, and this is fine by me. I like wearing the same type of clothing every day of the year. I appreciate not needing air conditioning and mesh screens on the windows to keep out the kind of insects and flying animals that drain your blood or eat away your face while you are sleeping.I like knowing that so long as I do not go walking up Ben Nevis in carpet slippers in February I will almost certainly never perish from the elements in this soft and gentle country.” Well I have to say that’s an admirable expression of satisfaction with our weather system here. Not sure the rest of us feel the same though. We seem to like complaining about it despite the fact that most of us have lived with it all our lives.Why aren’t we conditioned to it? Why do we complain about snow showers in April and May when it happens most years? One thing I really don’t understand is that we complain about our poor summers and yet they are the norm. However if we do get happen to get a hot one and yes it does happen, occasionally, people go mad complaining about the heat and the lack of rain. Come on, get a grip, you either want hot weather or you don’t. When it comes to the weather I have to admit that we British are prone to hyperbole and Bill Bryson notes this:“… As I sat eating my breakfast in the dining room of The Old England Hotel in Bowness - on -Windemere, two days after leaving Morecambe, I was reading an article in The Times about an unseasonable snowstorm - a “blizzard”, The Times called it-that had gripped parts of East Anglia. According to The Times report, the storm had covered parts of the region with “more than two inches of snow” and created “drifts of up to six inches high. In response to this, I did something I had never done before: I pulled out my notebook and drafted a letter to the editor in which I pointed out, in a kindly helpful way, that two inches of snow cannot possibly constitute a blizzard and that six inches of snow is not a drift. A blizzard I explained, is when you can’t get your door open. Drifts are things that make you lose your car ‘til spring.” I hope you’ve enjoyed these extracts from Notes From A Small Island whether you’ve read the book or not. There are lots of topics I haven't covered like our attitude to our heritage, his feelings about Oxford, our Ordinance Survey maps and British buildings he would like to blow up.I can't resist going back to it and re reading some extremely funny bits, he makes me laugh out loud and really cheers me up. If you want to find out more about Bill Bryson take a look at the official website.I will add that, thank goodness for us, Bill Bryson eventually came back to England to live. He became Chancellor of Durham University and is now part of the campaign to protect rural England. Good lad Bill! Keep up the good work. Oh yes, we had a great holiday in Malta and one day I'll go back there."},

{"title": "Willow Pattern", "date": "Wednesday 20 May 2009", "text": "I have lots of Willow pattern stuff, I’m a sucker for it!I can’t remember the first time I saw the design but I remember the first time I saw a Welsh dresser with the Willow pattern crockery on it. My aunt and uncle got a new council house way back in the ‘fifties and the first time I went to see it, I fell in love with their Welsh dresser.When we bought our first home I knew I had to have one and had to collect the Willow pattern crockery to go with it. The first time my mother in law saw the dresser she said, “It’s old and looks second hand. Why didn’t you buy teak?” In the ‘sixties teak, chrome and glass were the latest trends. Everyone had them but I really disliked them! So trying to be polite I told her I preferred old fashioned furniture and that teak wasn’t my cup of tea. I’ve never regretted it, it’s still there, looking a little bit the worse for wear after nearly forty years. Just wish I could have bought the Ercol dresser but it was too big for the dining room we had then and much too expensive.I looked at the different dinner services available to go with the dresser and there were two I liked, both in the traditional blue and white. Spode's Blue Italian was lovely and so was Wedgewood’s Willow. I decided on the Wedgewood, I preferred the Willow design, it was better known and I thought would be available to buy for years to come. They advertised that all their dinner services would be produced for fifteen years. I gradually bought the Wedgewood Willow dinner service and decided that I wanted the pleasure of using it everyday. My Mam always had china she didn’t use. I suppose they didn’t have much before and after the War so they had to be very careful about their possessions. They never knew if they could replace them. She died before she was fifty and never had the pleasure of using it. So we used our Willow for about five years. Then, in their wisdom Wedgewood withdrew the design. Apart from the dinner plates (which I had lots of) I stopped using the service as I knew I wouldn’t be able to replace anything I broke. Well it’s been sitting on and in the dresser for years and I think it’s time I started to use it again. My daughter and daughter in law don’t like traditional stuff so no point in keeping it for them. I might as well get the pleasure out of using it even if I break something. There’s always eBay!I love the story of the Willow Pattern and I found a poem about it: The Willow Pattern PoemMy Willow ware plate has a story,Pictorial, painted in blueFrom the land of tea and the tea plantAnd the little brown man with a queue. Whatever the food you serve, daughter Romance enters into the feast,If you only pay heed to the legend, On the old china plate from the East. Koong Shee was a mandarin’s daughterAnd Chang was her lover, ah me, or surely her father’s accountantMight never wed pretty Koong Shee.  So Chang was expelled from the compound,The lover’s alliance to break,And pretty Koong Shee was imprisonedIn a little blue house by the lake. The Doughty old mandarin reasonedIt was time that his daughter should wed,And the groom of his choosing should banish,That silly romance from her head.  In symbols the dress she should wear,Her headband of scarlet lay waiting,She should ride in a gold wedding chair.  He was busily plotting and planning,When a message was brought him one day,Young Chang had invaded the palace, And taken his sweetheart away. They were over the bridge when he saw them,They were passing the big willow tree,And a boat at the edge of the water,Stood waiting for Chang and Koong Shee.  The furious mandarin followed,The groom with revenge in his eyes,But the little boat danced on the waterAnd travelled away with the prize.  But vengeance pursued to their shelterAnd burned the pagoda, they sayFrom out of the flames rose the loversA pair of doves winging away.  They flew toward the western heavenThe pretty Koong Shee and her ChangOr so says the famous old legendFrom the land of the Yangtze Kiang.  I wouldn’t be one to deny it,For the little blue dove and her mateForever are flying togetherAcross my Willow ware plate."},
{"title": "Blue Remembered Hills!", "date": "Monday 11 May 2009", "text": "Kojak alias Telly SavalasWhat started my nostalgia trip today? Well it’s Monday and since I stopped working I love Mondays. I normally I meet up with my daughter and granddaughter and we just spend time together maybe shopping or having a coffee. Something we’ve never had time to do for years.Today she was working so I was left to my own devices, well until lunchtime anyway. Yes, I admit it, I switched on the telly. As I posted a while ago, I've been watching some great detective shows recently and wallowing a little in nostalgia. However I did start to worry about what seems to becoming an addiction so I've taken to listening to the radio and sometimes the dreaded iPod.Anyway when I switched on today, Kojak was showing. I really liked it the first time around although it’s not my favourite; Harry O has that honour and I’m sure he always will. However I must admit Saturday nights were never the same without Theo sucking his lollipop.I think I look at these programmes in a different way now, not just finding out what happens in the story. I listen to the well written scripts, see the more subtle humour, the relationships between the characters, the facial expressions and listen to the score, not just the theme tune.It’s a bit of a morbid fascination because I always feel really sad when the programmes have finished, in fact today I could feel the tears coming. Not that the programme was particularly sad. Yes there had been a number of killings but the programme had quite a neatly tied up resolution with the baddie ending up in court. I think I was in that kind of a mood, after all I’d put the telly on to cheer me up a bit. However I wondered what had brought me to tears.Well maybe it was a realisation that the programmes take me back to a time to when I was young and getting over some really sad times. Music and TV programmes like these were my Tardis transporting me to another time and place, almost another planet really, for a while at least. Plus you tell yourself that they just don’t make programmes like these any more. Don’t you? A sure sign you’re getting on that one. Probably the saddest fact of all, is that a lot of the wonderful actors like David Janssen and Telly Savalas died quite a while ago.Although the ‘seventies gets some stick for being a bad time in the field of fashion, (wedge boots and satin flares to name a couple of dubious items of apparel) there was some great telly. It was once voted as the golden era of British television and it's not difficult to see why. However my tastes were not too highbrow in those days, I just wanted to be entertained!You’ll note in my list below, there’s a plethora of detective shows and comedies. I not only wanted to be taken to another planet, I wanted something to make me laugh again. There’s a few children’s shows too. My children were quite young in the seventies and I liked to watch TV with them! There are lots more programmes and no doubt I‘ve forgotten some, but here’s a selection of ‘seventies telly I used to watch.· Harry O (the rest of the list is in alphabetical order but Harry has to be top of my list!)· Abigail's Party - A concession to culture· A Family at War – fantastic TV series about a family during WW11· Bagpuss - Recently voted the most popular children’s TV programme ever! Must have been a lot of females in their thirties voting.· Agony· Battle Star Galactica· Bewitched· Blake’s Seven· Blue Remembered Hills (Another concession to culture) · Boney (Aussies will remember this one)· Butterflies· The Bionic Woman· Cannon· Carrie’s War· Columbo· Citizen Smith· Dallas· Dad’s Army· Happy Days· Hart to Hart· I Didn’t Know You Cared· Ironside· Jim’ll Fix it· Kojak· Last of the Summer Wine (Longest running sit-com in the world!)· Lizzie Dripping· Little House on the Prairie· M*A*S*H· McCloud· McMillan and Wife· Me Mammy· Michael Bentine’s Potty Time· Monty Python’s Flying Circus· Mork and Mindy· Multi-Coloured Swap Shop· Nearest and Dearest· Oh Brother!· Poldark· Quincy ME· Rising Damp· Rockford Files· Rhoda· Secret Army· Six Million Dollar Man· Some Mothers Do 'Ave 'Em (Michael Crawford’s surreal and manic portrayal of Frank Spencer)· Starsky and Hutch· Take Hart (I loved this children’s art programme. Sad Tony Hart died recently, he was fantastic, wonder how many artists he inspired)· The Streets of San Francisco· The WaltonsI got to thinking that it’s great going back to these classic shows and enjoying them in a different way, but you just can’t go back can you. The past is a place in our hearts and minds, what Houseman called “Blue Remembered Hills“. I love that expression, it really encapsulates the whole feeling I have for my TV “Land of Lost Content”. I’m not much good at remembering poetry but this extract always sticks in my mind, thanks to Denis Potter’s fantastic play, Blue Remembered Hills.Into my heart an air that killsFrom yon far country blows:What are those blue remembered hills,What spires, what farms are those?That is the land of lost content,I see it shining plain,The happy highways where I wentAnd cannot come again.Extract from A Shropshire Lad - A.E. HousmanNow that almost reduces me to tears too. So after this session of wallowing in nostalgia, a few tears, (some of them I'm sure were for the lovely actors who are now no longer with us) and how today so much TV is absolute DROSS, I should feel a bit down. Not a bit of it. Why?Well it’s a lovely sunny day, chilly, but glorious blue skies and just after Kojak finished, the postman came. I got the result of my recent mammogram. It was fine. I had been dreading it and I’m not sure why I got myself worked up about it this time, but I did. Getting that letter was like winning the lottery! Now I’m going to pick up my little charmer from nursery and looking forward to my holidays.Photo Source: Nicolas Savalas - Wiki Commons"},
{"title": "What on Earth Possessed Me?", "date": "Friday 1 May 2009", "text": "I’ve started lots of things I’ve never got around to finishing. Sometimes I’m not sure why. Procrastination strikes again! Maybe the project wasn’t turning out as well as I expected or something else came along I needed to do. Possibly I just got bored with it. However when I look at this crochet runner pattern, how long did I think it would take me? I couldn't have finished it in a month of Sundays! Just look at it! What the devil possessed me to even think about it? All those little circles, dozens and dozens of them. It must have been a mental abberation! And I'm usually quite a practical person.Another thing the cotton was thin, very thin and the crochet hook I had to use was so thin it was like a needle. Into the bargain I was working full time so when on earth was I going to have time to do it? Well I didn’t!It has lain in the cupboard for over five years and I came across it when I was going through the stuff in the black hole (cupboard under the stairs) this week. Trying to get a bit of tidying done. Well that's what I was telling myself. To be honest nearly all of it just got shoved back in again.I think I remember what put me off finishing this was I couldn’t grasp how the bits were fastened together. Normally when you crochet, you link the pieces as you go. I had managed to put some bits together but there were lots of loose pieces. What I found in the black hole! As part of my current attempt to do things I’ve put off for years and finish things I’ve started, I decided to have another go at this. I had another look at the pattern to try to figure out how the pieces linked. I’ve done a bit of Irish crochet in the past and had no problems with it. However it was no good, I still couldn’t understand it. I decided to just stitch the bits together and see what it looked like. If it was rubbish I’d scrap the whole thing.Well here it is and it looks OK after a good pressing. However its sods law that I've hit a couple of problems!  Current State of PlayFirst, I’ve only completed four crosses and fillings. The pattern has twelve crosses and zillions of little circle fillings! Think I’ll be realistic and just go for eight crosses. Which means I'm halfway there.Second, for some reason best known to the crochet fairy, the next cross I made was a lot smaller than the others. *?@&** I'm using the same crochet hook and the same thread so what the heck is going on I don't know. I'll have to try another and see what that turns out like. If it's as small as the last one it won't fit the four I've already done. I'll have to settle for a small square with four crosses. That would mean I've already finished!If I ever finish the eight crosses, I’ll show you. One thing I know is, I’ll never again attempt anything like this."},

I was listening to Ken Bruce on Radio 2 and then he played Kylie Minoghue singing \"On a Night Like This\". Suddenly I was back in the summer of 2000 at the closing ceremony of the fantastic Sydney Olympic Games. I might add I didn't have the good fortune to actually be there. Sadly, I was only watching it on telly, but it was still wonderful.I remembered how great those Olympics were and that closing ceremony was just perfect. Remember that fabulous Priscilla Queen of the Desert bus, the Strictly Ballroom dancers, the surfers and the fabulous Kylie Minoghue? You just knew watching and listening to her that this was going to remake her and it did.Thanks Sydney and Kylie, it was a great night to finish a fabulous Olympic Games and you made me feel much better today!Unfortunately the embedding for this You Tube video doesn't work.

{"title": "Watching the Detectives", "date": "Sunday 26 April 2009", "text": "I like the telly!Well I did identify it as one of my guilty pleasures a little while back. I try not to watch daytime telly too much as I don’t get anything done. However during the daytime now that Wanted Down Under has finished, I really only watch Diagnosis Murder. Yes I know it’s a bit lightweight in the drama stakes and it’s often corny, but I love it. So now I’m listening to the radio in the morning, Radio 2 of course!When I started to think about my telly watching, I realised that I mainly watch comedy and crime dramas as I don’t like the reality and talent type of programmes and I’m not into the soaps. There’s not a lot of decent comedy around so it’s mainly crime drama that I watch now.What am I watching in the crime drama stakes at night? Well I’ve been watching Lewis, Inspector Morse’s old sidekick. It’s not quite in the same league as Morse however it's good but sadly it’s finished. Well there were only six, two hour episodes. I do like the two hour programme format that they introduced with Inspector Morse, they get more story into it and you don’t feel they’re cramming everything in to the last five minutes.I’m also watching the new series of The Number One Detective Agency I posted about recently. I do love it. The scenery is great, the music is lovely and the characters are just wonderful.Ashes to Ashes is back again thank goodness. It’s not as gripping as Life on Mars, but it’s good and funny too.When I think back over the years there have been so many good TV crime drama series. The first one I remember was Dixon of Dock Green with the lovely Jack Warner as Sergeant Dixon. He was everybody’s idea of a what a British bobby should be like, even though he was well over retirement age when he made the series. I think it was that one that got me hooked on crime dramas!Over the years there have been dozens I’ve enjoyed, some I never could take to and a few that I’ve loved. At Easter ITV3 had a programme on the Top Cops where you voted online for your favourite TV Cop Show. Well that’s what it said and although I missed the voting for the top fifty, I thought I’d get to see some of my favourites I haven’t seen in years. Well I watched for three hours and guess what? I didn’t get to see some of my favourites! I won't bore you with the whole fifty, only the top ten. Here they are:10 - The Sweeney with Jack Regan and George Carter from the Flying Squad who were just about as bad as the villains they were chasing, rough and tough. Not one of my favourites. 9 - Rebus – the alcoholic troubled and tormented cop. Again not one I took to.8 - Sherlock Holmes - He was played by over 100 actors but most popular has been Jeremy Brett. Still great to watch after al these years. 7 - Foyle’s War with Christopher Foyle the gentle, quiet and unassuming detective during second world war. One of my all time favourites and they're bringing him back for another series.6 - Inspector Frost – A crumpled, dishevelled character who irritates everyone especially his boss, Superintendent Mullett. I love the humour and the real feel to this series.5 - Inspector Morse – This has got to be the most intelligent and classy TV detective series ever made and in the wonderful setting of Oxford. I didn't take to it at first but I can watch it now over and over again now, and I do. First class TV!4 - Midsomer Murders – Once described as Miss Marple on acid! This series makes rural England more dangerous than downtown Basra! However very easy viewing.3 - Poirot – I love David Suchet as Poirot, he's amazing. It's a wonderfully produced series with beautiful clothes, wonderful touches of humour, brilliant actors and lovely thirties settings.2 - Life on Mars – Oh this was one you couldn’t miss! You had to see whether Sam Tyler, the modern politically correct cop came out of his coma and got back to the 21st Century after an accident had sent him back to the perils of seventies policing. Brilliant and compulsive viewing.1- The Professionals – Bodie and Doyle working for CI5 in an action packed programme full of car chases, fights and guns in the seventies. Not one I felt a great liking for and I find it hard to believe that this was the number one in the vote. In fact I find it impossible.No I don't believe this was a fair ballot, not because The Professionals came out on top. It's because the fifty were selected for you and you could only vote for those that somebody at ITV had selected. What a swizz!You probably noticed that all the top ten were British programmes, well there were lots of American ones in the top fifty such as Kojak, Magnum and Columbo. However I can tell you that some of my favourites didn't make the top fifty. Why? Because they were not included in the list! Whatever happened to Harry O for goodness sake? I loved this series. Probably the best American TV detective series ever made. So which prize pratt at ITV 3 didn't include him?Oh and what about The Rockford Files? Yes I know his character wasn't as well drawn as Harry O but it was great viewing and there were nice touches of humour.Monk wasn't in the list, nor was Cannon, Due South and neither was the wonderful Newcastle based 55 Degrees North. So I think it’s time for me to whack off an email to ITV 3 to tell them what I think about their so called Top Fifty cop shows.In the meantime I think I might take a nostalgia trip and do a few postings on my favourite detective shows.

{"title": "It's Saint George's Day!", "date": "Thursday 23 April 2009", "text": "Flag of Saint George It might be Saint George's Day and although he's the patron saint of England, it's not a public holiday so not much in the way of celebrations or people wearing the national flower, a red rose. Why not?Well I think that's weird because the other countries that are part of the United Kingdom celebrate their patron saints days. You're more likely to see a Saint Patrick's Day parade on March 17th in England, than any celebration of Saint George on 23rd April. So why don't we celebrate Saint George's Day?A recent survey show that little is known about England's national day being \"celebrated\" today and it's not really surprising given that there is so little about it publicised and celebrated. In the poll carried out by This England magazine:Seven out of 10 young people in England have no idea when St George's Day falls 40% said they did not know why St George is the patron saint of England One in eight people said they found it embarrassing to see the St George Cross flying, due to the patriotic symbol having been hijacked by extremists for their own benefitsThere is a real danger that in future, St George's Day could be deemed irrelevant to the younger generations of English people. So much for the Citizenship lessons that are part of the National Curriculum they've been delivering in school for the last few years!The survey also reported that the majority of English people think that all St George ever did was kill a dragon. So what do we really know about Saint George?Historians have debated the exact details of the birth of Saint George for over a century, the approximate date of his death is subject to debate.It is likely that Saint George was born to a Christian noble family in Nicomedia, during the late third century between about 275 AD and 285 AD, and he died in Lydda, Palestine. His father, Geronzio, was a Roman army official from Cappadocia and his mother was from Palestine. They were both Christians and from noble families of Anici, so by this the child was raised with Christian beliefs.They decided to call him George, meaning \"worker of the land\". At the age of 14, George lost his father; a few years later, George's mother, Policronia, died. Then George decided to go to Nicomedeia, the imperial city of that time, and present himself to Emperor Diocletian to apply for a career as a soldier.Diocletian welcomed him with open arms, as he had known his father, Geronzio — one of his finest soldiers. By his late 20s, George was promoted to the rank of Tribunus and stationed as an imperial guard of the Emperor at Nicomedeia.In the year AD 302, Diocletian (influenced by Galerius) issued an edict that every Christian soldier in the army should be arrested and every other soldier should offer a sacrifice to the Pagan gods. But George objected and with the courage of his faith approached the Emperor and ruler. Diocletian was upset, not wanting to lose his best Tribune and the son of his best official, Geronzio. George loudly renounced the Emperor's edict, and in front of his fellow soldiers and Tribunes he claimed himself to be a Christian and declared his worship of Jesus Christ.Diocletian attempted to convert George, even offering gifts of land, money and slaves if he made a sacrifice to the Pagan gods. The Emperor made many offers, but George never accepted.Recognizing the futility of his efforts, Diocletian was left with no choice but to have him executed for his refusal. Before the execution George gave his wealth to the poor and prepared himself. After various torture sessions, including laceration on a wheel of swords in which he was resuscitated three times, George was executed by decapitation before Nicomedia's city wall, on April 23, 303. A witness of his suffering convinced Empress Alexandra and Athanasius, a pagan priest, to become Christians as well, and so they joined George in martyrdom. His body was returned to Lydda for burial, where Christians soon came to honour him as a martyr.What about the best-known story about Saint George, his fight with a dragon? According to Wiki it's a myth brought back with the Crusaders.Extracted from Wiki We aren't the only ones to hold Saint George in high esteem. He's also patron saint of Aragon, Catalonia, Ethiopia, Georgia, Greece, Lithuania, Palestine, Portugal, and Russia, as well as the cities of Amersfoort, Barcelona, Beirut, Bteghrine, Cáceres, Ferrara, Freiburg, Genoa, Ljubljana, Gozo, Pomorie, Qormi, Lod and Moscow.Barcelona and Saint GeorgeIn Barcelona he's known as Sant Jordi and guess what? The day is Barcelona's Valentine's day, a day when kissometer readings go off the charts. They celebrate the fact that Sant Jordi allegedly slew a dragon about to devour a beautiful princess south of Barcelona. From the dragon's blood sprouted a rosebush, from which the hero plucked the prettiest for the princess. So they have had a traditional Rose Festival celebrated in Barcelona since the Middle Ages to honour chivalry and romantic love. It's a day for men and mice alike to give their true loves roses.In 1923, the lovers' fest merged with International Book Day to mark the anniversary of the deaths of Miguel de Cervantes and William Shakespeare on 23rd April 1616. (23rd April was also WIlliam Shakespeare's birthday). Over four million roses and half a million books are sold in Catalunya on Sant Jordi's Day, men giving their inamoratas roses and the ladies giving books in return. Bookstalls run the length of the Rambla, and despite the fact that April 23rd is an official workday, nearly all of Barcelona manages to play hookey and wander.Source: Spanish Property World Now maybe we should all take a leaf out that book if you pardon the pun. Well let's face it, they really do know how to party in Barcelona!"},

Think we should make the most of it, this might be our summer!Seems like this poem expresses how I feel about spring here in England. It just suddenly appears from nowhere and to be truthful although I love going on holiday, I wouldn't want to be anywhere else at the moment.Home Thoughts, From AbroadOh, to be in England,Now that April's there,And whoever wakes in EnglandSees, some morning, unaware,That the lowest boughs and the brushwood sheafRound the elm-tree bole are in tiny leaf,While the chaffinch sings on the orchard bough In England--now!And after April, when May follows,And the whitethroat builds, and all the swallows!Hark, where my blossomed pear-tree in the hedgeLeans to the field and scatters on the cloverBlossoms and dewdrops--at the bent spray's edge--That's the wise thrush; he sings each song twice over,Lest you should think he never could recaptureThe first fine careless rapture!And though the fields look rough with hoary dew,All will be gay when noontide wakes anewThe buttercups, the little children's dower--Far brighter than this gaudy melon-flower.Robert Browning When I read the poem this morning I remembered this song. It's another of my favourites, written and sung by Clifford T Ward.He wrote it for his wife in 1973 when he was touring the American Army bases in France and based it on the Browning poem, Home Thoughts From Abroad.He was a wonderful singer songwriter but suffered from multiple sclerosis and sadly he died in 2001.Nice one Clifford!Home Thoughts from Abroad - Clifford T Ward"},

I can't post the whole front page on the screen dump and also I’ve customised it to have the topics displayed that suit me. You can add a range of features such as sport, food, science, blogs, business and money etc. In addition you can change the colour to suit what you prefer or you have the option I have chosen to have it rotate colours.Really useful features of the site are that you can not only customise it, you can localise it too. So you can have your local weather and news at the click of the mouse.Another feature I like is that it keeps changing. A few minutes after I had moved off the home page I went back and the page colour had changed to a purple shade and with Kylie Minoghue featuring on video.BBC Home PageThe children’s section is great especially CBeebies. My granddaughter absolutely loves it. All her favourite programmes are there with lots of different activities like painting, making things, singing, dancing, games, poetry etc.  CBeebiesWhat I like about it is the educational aspect but they make it fun.Lauren’s current favourite is a new programme called Poetry Pie. Her favourite poem and song?This one:The Potty SongNever put your potty on the table.Never put your potty on a chair.Never put your potty on the telly.Never put your potty on the stair.Never put your potty in pyjamas.Never put your potty in your bed.And never, never, never, never,Never, never, never - ever!Never put your potty on your head!Don’t they always like toilet humour!Another brilliant part of the site is the Education and Learning section. It covers all kinds of topics and there’s stuff there for adults, parents, teachers and students. The language section is particularly good, there’s audio and video courses in 36 languages. Amazing!  I know I sound like I’m advertising the BBC site and in case you’re wondering, no, I’m not on commission. I just love this site. A work colleague told me a few years ago that her friend worked on the BBC website team and it cost an absolute fortune to maintain and develop. Well if it did then, goodness only knows what it costs now, but it’s worth it.I've barely touched on the vast range of topics and features. For one thing I haven't mentioned BBC Radio. I'll save that for another day!To finish with, my favourite feature on the site is iPlayer. You can catch up on all your favourite programmes that you’ve missed. I don’t have any kind of service or technology to record telly programmes so I find this fantastic. You don’t need to worry about remembering to set the recorder or store it, it’s all there. Not sure if this works outside the UK. BBC iPlayerNow in their wisdom, nay stupidity, ITV have now scheduled Lewis at the same time as BBC air No 1 Ladies Detective Agency. I’m no expert on viewing figures or the ins and outs of TV scheduling but, I would have thought that to keep up your viewing figures, you don’t schedule a programme you want high figures for with the opposition’s prime new drama programme. That’s just dippy!My husband prefers to watch Lewis so I missed Sunday night's episode of The No 1 Ladies Detective Agency, so I’m off to catch up on it now.Bye for now!"},

Yesterday Once More, Rainy Days and Mondays and Superstar are all wonderful.However, if I had to pick one, I think this would be it, I Need to Be In Love. It just makes the hairs on the back of my neck stand up. The arrangement is superb, the lyrics are sheer poetry and the voice is exquisite. Just wonderful!Here is a live version of the song and unlike many singers, Karen Carpenter was superb live. The musical arrangement on the CD is a lot better than this version but it’s just great to see them again here. She was lovely. Sadly the lyrics just about summed up Karen Carpenter's situation.

{"title": "Only the Shoplifters Wear Coats!", "date": "Sunday 5 April 2009", "text": "About ten years ago, or maybe even longer, I noticed a strange phenomenon one day whilst travelling on the bus. It was the middle of winter, in fact, I remember there was a blizzard. A young chap got onto the bus wearing one of those short sleeved polyester football shirts, a Sunderland FC one in this case but he wasn’t wearing a coat. He must be just going to someone’s house I thought but no, he got off at the football stadium and was obviously going to the match as it was a Saturday lunchtime. In case you're wondering exactly what he was wearing you can take a look at it here. Well this is the latest retro shirt.Now I used to go to the matches in Sunderland in my youth but I remember being absolutely frozen even though I was well wrapped up with hat, scarf, thick winter coat, gloves and boots. The lad was going to get hypothermia if he wasn’t careful. I wondered whether he had learning difficulties or something as it seemed really daft to go out dressed like that.However as time passed, I saw more and more young people who didn’t wear coats. I realised that most young people in the North East, especially girls just don’t wear coats or jackets if they are going out somewhere and it doesn't matter what the weather is.You see them walking the streets winter and summer, rain, hail or shine with no coats, just strappy summer tops and mini skirts, the girls that is. They line up for clubs and pubs, skimpily clad in only their “glad rags” which are totally inappropriate for the frigid Northeast elements. I asked my daughter why they don’t wear coats and she said “Well where would you put your coat”? Mmmm carry them when you get in to a pub or restaurant maybe? No! Apparently you’d look a right prat carrying a coat!I checked out whether it happens in other countries and apparently lots of youngsters in the USA don’t like to wear coats either. However it’s mainly because they go to school in the car or bus and are only outside for a short while. They do wear light jackets and hoodies apparently. Well they don’t seem to do that here. I see them walking to school in the pouring rain most are just wearing thin cotton shirts. Some have lightweight school blazers but most don’t wear jumpers. They must sit in soaking wet clothes all day. As far as I can tell it doesn’t seem to happen in other parts of the country, just here for some reason.A few years ago the BBC TV drama series 55 Degrees North told the story of a police detective, Nicky Cole who was relocated from London to Newcastle after blowing the whistle on police corruption. (It was a great series and a pity they didn't continue it.) He found adjusting to life in the North a bit difficult and I found one of his comments about local people and the lack of outer clothing most memorable, “Only the shoplifters in Newcastle wear coats!” Well, is there a possible genetic reason for this bravery or is it simply because they like to show off their finery on a night out? Well now scientists want to discover if Geordies feel the cold or have extra thick skin to cope with low temperatures. A survey is to be carried out by staff at the Centre of Life in Newcastle to see how they are able to wear so little.The online questions include: 'What would persuade you to wear a coat on a night out?' (The likely answer to that is Nowt!)The investigation is part of the Newcastle ScienceFest, which will feature a 10-day programme of events to celebrate creativity and innovation. Have to say I don’t believe this for one minute. I think it’s a generation thing. You never see people over forty without winter coats!Also given that young people seem to drink quite a lot on nights out, maybe that’s why they don’t feel the cold.For more information check out the BBC website"},

Hard to believe it's just a few minutes walk from the Market Place. I worked in Durham for years and didn't know it existed. If you like English country gardens this is just up your street!Crook Hall is a Grade 1 listed Medieval Manor House. It has a 13th Century banqueting hall, and a 17th Century Jacobean room. Not large but very charming. It is supposedly haunted by the ghost of the White Lady. You are advised to avoid the Jacobean Room if you are sensitive to ghosts. I mustn't be as I didn't sense anything. It was rather cold in there on one of the hottest days of the year, but old stone buildings were designed to be cool in summer and warm in winter. 13th Century Banqueting RoomChildren can leave messages for the White Lady and there were lots there! When we visited there were lots of pieces of art there, stained glass balloons and kites, butterflies in a net, ceramics and a strange metal object like a bottle in the centre of the maze! There were lots of things for children to look for such as gnomes and bear heads and a maze to get lost in. Not for too long though as it is quite low.Alan Titchmarsh described it as \"A tapestry of colourful blooms\" and it certainly is. You can wander through different gardens such as the Secret Walled Garden, the Shakespeare Garden, the Cathedral Garden and the Silver and White Garden.Cathedral GardenThe Moat Pool is very tranquil, hard to drag yourself away from it. There are lots of little tables and chairs around the various gardens if you just fancy relaxing, taking in the wonderful scents and the peace of the place.Moat PoolIf the weather is fine you can enjoy a cream tea out in the gardens and if it's not, just go into the Georgian Dining Room. The \"delightful views of Durham Cathedral\" from the gardens were unfortunately spoilt by a huge crane, but luckily just a temporary thing! It's an absolute gem of a place if you like gardens and it's as the leaflet describes, \"an oasis of peace in the heart of Durham City\".There are various events going on throughout the season and although it's open mainly from late May to early September there are other activities going on at Bank Holiday times, Halloween and Christmas.

{"title": "Remember, the Clocks go Forward Sunday at 1.00am!", "date": "Friday 27 March 2009", "text": "On Sunday 29 March 2009 at 1.00am, Greenwich Mean Time ends and British Summer Time begins. So you need to move your clock forward one hour to 2.00 am. Well it's now over 100 years since British Summer Time was first proposed. Why you might ask.Well the idea of British Summer Time (BST), sometimes known as Daylight Saving Time, was first proposed by a keen horse-rider, William Willett, who was incensed at the 'waste' of useful daylight first thing in the morning, during summer. Though the sun had been up for hours during his rides through the local woods in Chislehurst and Petts Wood, people were still asleep in bed.In 1907 he published a pamphlet called The Waste of Daylight, outlining plans to encourage people out of bed earlier in summer by changing the time on the nation’s clocks. He spent the rest of his life fighting to get acceptance of his time-shifting scheme. He died in 1915 with the Government still refusing to back BST.Britain first adopted William Willett's Daylight Saving Time scheme in 1916, a few weeks after Germany. For years, the British Government had refused to introduce Daylight Saving Time, but by then, Britain and Germany were fighting each other in the First World War (1914-18), and any system that could save fuel and money was worth trying. The Summer Time Act of 1916 was quickly passed by Parliament and the first day of British Summer Time, 21 May 1916, was widely reported in the press.Within a few years of its introduction, most countries reasonably north or south of the equator had adopted Daylight Saving Time. But it has been controversial since the day William Willett first proposed it back in 1907, following his rural rides through Petts Wood.Permanent summer, 1968–1971In 1968, the clocks went forward as usual in March, but in the autumn, they did not return to Greenwich Mean Time. Britain had entered a three-year experiment, confusingly called British Standard Time, and stayed one hour ahead of Greenwich until 1971.This was not the first experiment to shift the clocks in winter. In the Second World War (1939-45), Britain had adopted Double British Summer Time, with the clocks one hour ahead of Greenwich in winter and two hours ahead in summer.When the British Standard Time experiment ended, the Home Office carried out an exhaustive review to find out whether it had been successful. The answer was both yes and no. There were ‘pros and cons’ to having the clocks forward and, on balance, the Government decided to return to the original British Summer Time.After a century of daylight saving, we still cannot agree on whether it is a good thing or not. When proposals to extend the system are occasionally made in Parliament, protest soon comes from those affected by its disadvantages. Daylight Saving Time tries to treat a complex network of symptoms with one solution. But not everybody sees it as a cure. So the debate continues.Extract from the National Maritime Museum, Greeenwich website"},

{"title": "What Day Does Spring Start?", "date": "Friday 20 March 2009", "text": "Well according to tradition spring starts on the night of 20/21 March. However the Meteorological Office classes the first day of spring as 1 March and a bit of a row has erupted now over the official date.Some disgruntled MPs are questioning who has had the authority to change the date. Stuart Bell, Labour MP for Middlesbrough says:\"Spring starts on March 20/21 and if the Met Office are not aware of this simple fact, it reflects a casual approach to facts, which is all too inherent today.\" “Historically spring starts on the day of the vernal equinox, which usually occurs on the night of 20/21 March. Vernal comes originally from the Latin word for bloom and refers to the fact that, in the northern hemisphere, this equinox marks the end of winter and the beginning of spring.An equinox is a time when the nights are as long as the days and the vernal equinox is recognised the world over as the start of the new astrological cycle.But does that necessarily make it the start of spring? After all, summer is commonly decreed to start on 21 June - the Summer Solstice - yet the following day is known as MID-summer's day.And since when has the prevailing weather had anything to do with it? Parts of the country may be ankle-deep in snow but cast your mind back three months and the talk was why, in mid-December, the weather felt like spring.The Met Office, meanwhile, has little time for celestial patterns and historical precedent. It picked 1 March for simplicity's sake, choosing to slot the four seasons neatly into the 12 months... June, July and August are the summer months; September, October and November autumn, and so on.“Mmmm, a very pragmatic approach!Extract from BBC website"},

Well I needn’t bother really as there wasn't much to report. I didn’t do as well as the first week.I did the crawl leg kick holding the float in front of me OK like last week. Next came putting my face in and out of the water as I did the leg kick. Now that was quite a bit harder to manage, but I did it.Next came combining three actions, the leg kick, the face in the water and finally taking one hand off the float and drawing it under the water and back then up to the float and doing the same with the other arm. Needless to say I just couldn’t co ordinate the three things. If I got the arms to work and the face in and out of the water, the legs gradually stopped. Talk about mutli tasking!The swimming instructor says it’s what usually happens, that people can do the first two but the legs just stop.Well I was worn out after four widths of this, well it is 25 metres across.

{"title": "Alexander McCall Smith", "date": "Sunday 15 March 2009", "text": "I saw an interesting interview this morning with Andrew McCall Smith, the author of the No 1 Ladies’ Detective Agency. What an interesting character he is. For years he was a professor of medical law, he lives in Edinburgh and he’s the author of over sixty books.The conversation naturally turned to his most popular books about Precious Ramotswe, Botswana’s finest and only female detective. He was asked why they are so popular when there’s never even a murder in them. He laughed and said that nothing really happens in them because there’s enough happening in the rest of the world. The books are really about people, what motivates them and how they behave. I thought that was a perfect description of them.What I didn’t know about him was he founded The Really Terrible Orchestra in Edinburgh. An orchestra composed of people who wanted to play in a real orchestra but weren’t good enough. He said they are terrible players but really enjoy themselves and people strangely enough want to come to hear them play. “They come expecting something to go wrong and we never disappoint!” They played at the end of the interview and he was right, they are terrible but what a delightful character he is. For anyone in New York, USA, the orchestra is performing there in April 2009. Go if you dare!Funnily enough I had watched the first film about the No 1 Ladies’ Detective Agency again last night! What a beautiful film it is. It was directed by Anthony Minghella with delightful background music, beautiful Botswana scenery and wildlife, wonderful actors portraying the characters and the gentle humour and stories about people. It's a far cry from the usual films about Africa and detective stories with as many murders, shootings and car chases as they can cram in!Precious is such a delightful character, a “traditionally built” Botswanan lady, with a beautiful smile, she’s warm, witty and has an inbuilt intuition about people. The other characters are cleverly drawn too. It’s no wonder these books are so popular across the world.I must get to the library, his new book in this series, Teatime for the Traditionally built has been published. Love that title. He also has a book from the 44 Scotland Street series published too, The Unbearable Lightness of Scones. I think this man likes his food!The new series of six episodes of The No 1 Ladies Detective Agency started tonight on BBC1. We enjoyed two hours of wonderful TV with not a murder or an advert in sight. First there was Larkrise to Candleford and then the No 1 Ladies’ Detective Agency.Sheer bliss!"},

She wanted to be eliminated in the first programme but was too popular.Paddy & Keith – Dirty DancingThis one was great, they took it so seriously. The actual dance tonight was much funnier than this clip and the judges and presenters were crying laughing at them.Robert Webb – FlashdanceThis one really made me laugh. I love the bit where he tries to jump back onto his feet and can’t. As Jo Brand says he makes a more attractive woman than she does bless her!Dick and Dom Shake Their TailfeathersI’m not a big fan of Dick & Dom, prefer Ant & Deck but they did OK.Denise Lewis and Martin Offiah do Bombay DreamsI thought they were excellent. He moves really well for a rugby player and she’s still in good shape after her Olympic heptathlon days. Well she did do Strictly Come Dancing in 2004 so maybe she's kept her dancing shoes on.The Bill Does RiverdanceThese weren’t funny they were quite good, well Lisa Maxwell was. Made me wonder whether maybe she’d done some Irish dancing before.The BBC videos of all the dancers are on their Red Nose website.And the winner was………Robert Webb!I really enjoy the humour of Comic Relief as well as finding out about how they spend the money they raise.It’s really tearjerking stuff watching those children in Africa die of malaria and the high number of women who die in childbirth. No wonder the celebrities break down when they are filming. Although it's hard to watch it's great to see how they spend the money both in this country and in Africa.On the lighter side here are some of my favourite comedy parts of the night.Mama MiaLoved the take off by Jennifer Saunders, Dawn Fench, Joanna Lumley and Phllip Glennister. I thought about Gill when I was watching it and her post about the singing from the film Mama Mia. There are a couple of other clips but my favourite is The Winner Takes it All! I really detested the Meryl Streep version but I do like most of the other songs from the film. I digress, anyway judge for yourself.I Just Can't Get Enough - The SaturdaysI liked the earlier version of this by Depeche Mode but I love the official song release for this year by The Saturdays. For the Golden Oldies watch out for a brief glimpse of Muffin the Mule.I found the Robbie Williams and Little Britain sketch really funny. I think Robbie Williams has found his niche. Well he’ll have to do something as he didn’t have the sense to go back to Take That. They’ve only posted the first part of the sketch and it was the final part that was funniest.One of the funniest parts of the night was when they showed the filming of the video of Is This the Way to Amarillo? with Peter Kay and others from an earlier show in 2005. Yes, the bit where Ronnie Corbett fell off the treadmill. They showed you how it was filmed with Peter Kay telling how it happened and everyone trying not to laugh when he fell. It was so funny and luckily he wasn't hurt. I don't think they'll match that in a hurry! If you want to see it again here's the original.  I’m not a fan of The Office and I didn’t find The Office Opera sketch funny at all but if you’re a fan you can find it on You Tube and there are lots more clips from last night’s programmes including The Royle Family and Harry Hill's TV Burp."},

{"title": "My Third Guilty Pleasure", "date": "Saturday 7 March 2009", "text": "Watching Daytime TellyNow why should I feel guilty about it? My husband never does, he can watch telly all day, however I do get the guilt pangs.Maybe it’s because there was no daytime TV when I was young other than children’s TV. Ah the memories come flooding back, Muffin the Mule, Andy Pandy, Bill & Ben the Flowerpot men.So what is the charm of daytime telly for me? Well I still haven’t got used to getting up and not going to work. So I watch telly programmes when I think I should be at work. It feels a bit like skiving off. Wonder when I'll get used to this. Strange how you're conditioned to going to work.The telly is usually on as my husband switches it on the minute he gets up, that's anytme after 5.30am. He seems to be addicted to watching the BBC morning news. I wouldn't care I've seen it and they repeat the same things afer about an hour.He then goes off to work and I make my latte and sit down to watch a little telly. What do I watch? Well not the BBC news, I don't want to be depressed watching stories about the economy.Inspector Morse is one of my favourites. I do like a good detective programme and this is probably the best. Funnily enough I didn’t like it at first but it grew on me. It has just about everything to recommend it a few murders but no gratuitous violence and bad language. It has an amazing cast of characters in every programme, a virtual who’s who of British actors. The one with John Gielgud is one of my favourites. There’s humour, fabulous scenery, wonderful scripts and although opera music isn’t my favourite genre, it does add a touch of class to the programmes.This is one telly series that actually improves on the books. I’ve read a couple of Colin Dexter’s Morse books and they’re OK but the programmes are better. Colin Dexter himself admitted this on a programme about the making of the telly series.Pie in the Sky is another wonderful TV detective series. I love Richard Griffiths, he has such a dry way of dealing with situations and nothing like the dreaded Uncle Dursley character he plays in the Harry Potter films. If you haven't seen it, forget Starsky and Hutch, Kojak and CSI; this series is a million miles away! There’s not always a dead body, no bad language (a pet hate of mine) wonderful actors, lovely gentle humour and a recurring food theme with his restaurant which provides the title for the series.Wanted Down Under is something I’m almost addicted to. I absolutely love watching a UK family being transported to Australia or New Zealand to see how they would adapt to living there. Apparently 40% of UK families who emigrate there return in less than 2 years, so this programme gives them an opportunity to check out the place, the work situation, housing and lifestyle in a place of their choice. It’s great seeing the different places and the people’s reactions. The hardest is watching the videos from friends and families. I have to say I would have loved to live in New Zealand but I know I could never have left my family behind.Jeeves and Wooster is a series I didn’t see first time around for some reason. The antics of those wonderful upper class twits is a joy to behold, the ridiculous situations they get into really makes me laugh. There’s lovely scenery and again there’s a wonderful cast, the pairing of Hugh Laurie and Stephen Fry is a just class.I also watch a lot of children's telly once I pick Lauren up from nursery. I don’t like much of it but have to say I fell in love with In the Night Garden and I don't feel at all guilty watching it because I'm keeping Lauren company!I could listen to the introduction over and over again, well I do most days! I love the poem and the music, Derek Jacobi provides the perfect rendering of the poem. If you haven’t heard it, here’s a clip.Those characters with the silly names are great, there's Upsy Daisy, Igglepiggle, Tombliboos, Makka Pakka, the Pontipines, Wallanders, Haahoos, the Ninky Nonk and the Pinky Ponk, well you get the picture! How sad is that knowing all their names? I need to get a life!Along with most other young children, my granddaughter has all the characters, books, toys, jigsaws, DVDs, dressing up outfit, pyjamas, dressing gown and slippers. Wish I had shares in that programme.   Upsy Daisy and IgglepiggleThey have a good section on the CBeebies website that Lauren loves to play on. http://www.bbc.co.uk/cbeebies/inthenightgarden/Want to play in the Night Garden? Just click on one of the stars.http://www.bbc.co.uk/cbeebies/inthenightgarden/flash/index.shtmlIf you have a webcam you can have your/child/grandchild’s face appear in parts of the picture and only you can see it. The instructions are here http://www.bbc.co.uk/cbeebies/inthenightgarden/info.shtmlYes, sad old git that I am, I’m hooked, I’ll admit it.Anyway, it’ll be OK when my husband retires because he's a definite telly addict, it'll be on all day. I'll have no guilt at all, well he certainly doesn't. We can watch it together, as long as it’s not flippin’ sport! I heard the good news today that F1 is returning to the BBC. They've even got a new section on the BBC website for it. He'll be over the moon as he's complained non stop about it being on ITV and \"constantly\" interrupted by adverts. Good old advertising free BBC! Well that's if you don't count all the trailers for their programmes.I have one story about telly I never let him forget. When I was at the polytechnic many moons ago, I had to go on a field trip for twelve days to Yugoslavia, as it was called then. I felt really guilty about leaving the children (nine and eleven so not that young) for so long. You see my guilt complex! My husband said not to worry, it would be a doddle! He would take a couple of weeks off from work, look after the kiddiwinks and decorate the living room and dining room.I came back home and guess what? No decorating done. Why? Well it was late June and the 1982 World Cup was being played in Spain. I suppose he must have watched every match televised even though England didn't win. Again!"},
{"title": "Swimming and Me", "date": "Thursday 5 March 2009", "text": "I love swimming even though I’m not very good at it. When we go on holiday I love swimming in the pools whatever kind of water it is and no matter what the temperature. I have to swim at least once a day.It must be something inbuilt and I've never admitted this before but I've often had nightmares where it's the last day of my holiday and for some reason I haven't been into the pool. Talk about panic, I'm demented. Maybe it's a metaphor, something to do with getting older and you haven't done the things you really wanted to do. I don't know. Sometimes I really wonder about myself. Good job I've never seen a psychiatrist.Anyway I can swim quite a few lengths but I just can’t put my head under the water so I’ve never been able to do the crawl. I’ve always envied those people just effortlessly gliding up and down the pool doing the crawl. My son in law has a wonderful smooth style, barely a splash and he taught himself to do it. Well I’ve tried, but without putting my face into the water, what a farce.When I was approaching sixty, I had that feeling you get when you start to think about all the things in your life you’ve never done. A bit like that Bucket List film I should think. I kept putting off doing anything about it because I have to say putting my face into the local swimming pool full of chlorine and other nasty stuff just didn’t bear thinking about.Well last year they opened a new Aquatic Centre in Sunderland, about 7 miles from where I live. Until this pool was built we didn’t have a 50 metre pool in the North East, the nearest were Leeds and Edinburgh, over a hundred miles in each direction.Opening Night at the Aquatic Centre © City of SunderlandIt's a weird looking building from the outside and has lots of derelict land which hasn't been landscaped. I gather it's part of a redevelopment area and at the moment they're going through a public consulation. Still you think they would have tidied it up and put a bit of grass on it. Front EntranceSide View (Looks a bit like a Hovercraft!)I didn’t get around to visiting it until a few weeks ago and I was very pleasantly surprised by it, well the inside anyway. It’s got 10 lanes of 50 metre length which is wonderful for a spot of exercise. There’s a diving pool too, not that I have any ambitions in that direction. Both the main pool and multi-purpose pool have moveable floors so their depths can be varied. This accommodates a range of activities from aqua aerobics to water polo, enabling swimmers of all abilities to use them. Pool Area © City of SunderlandThe main pool also has a movable boom, which can be used to alter its length or sub-divide it, allowing more than one group of swimmers to use it at the same time. So you can have three different sections, school children having lessons, a free swimming area and lanes for the more serious swimmer.Children's Activity Session © City of SunderlandThere isn't a children’s pool as this is not a leisure pool although they do put on fun sessions for youngsters, usually in school holidays.However for me the best thing is the water quality, it’s fantastic. Some kind of bio filtering system so there’s hardly any nasty chemicals in the water.To save time and travelling costs, I went back to our local pool in Washington last Friday morning and it was awful. It was packed with people of a certain age, like me, but the problem was they were swimming so slow I don’t know how they stayed afloat. Made me feel like Rebecca Adlington, well not really. Apart from the obvious fact she got two gold medals at the summer Olympics last year, I don't spend a fortune on Jimmy Choo shoes. Then there were the awful chemicals to contend with. Yuk!So I made up my mind I was going to visit the Aquatic Centre more regularly and procrastination time was over. Yesterday I signed up for a swimming improver's class as they call it. Bargain of the day, it only cost £13.50 for 5 sessions! I do have a membership of the leisure club which is quite cheap if you’re over 60 and that made the classes very good value.Well today was the day, I went for my first lesson. There were only 5 people there for the lesson and we had quite a laugh. The instructor was really nice and she taught me to put my face into the water. Success! I eventually kept it there for a few seconds. I also managed to swim a width of the pool with a float doing a crawl kick. Good grief I thought I would lose the use of my legs, it’s so hard to do compared to breast stroke kick. Must be really good exercise.I’m really looking forward to next week and my second lesson. I’m feeling pleased with myself for getting off my bum and trying to improve my swimming. Hopefully by the time I go on holiday to Rhodes in May, I might be able to do a sort of crawl. Might being the operative word. Watch this space!"},
{"title": "My Second Guilty Pleasure", "date": "Saturday 28 February 2009", "text": "I Do Like a Lie in!I really do love not having to get up for work now. I always used to love a lie in when I was young and my Mam bless her used to let us lie in until lunch time if we’d been out to a dance the night before.I’m just not an early to bed person, I’m rarely in bed before midnight and I’ve never been a morning person. I always found it hard to get up when the alarm went off, and I used to turn over for an extra few minutes. I used to leave the alarm on at weekends just for the pleasure of turning over and switching it off. I’m not bad tempered or anything I just function better afternoons and evenings.Guess what? My husband is the opposite, he gets up anytime after 5.30 am. It’s such a pain!Some mornings I’m still up early to take the kiddoes to school and nursery but others I have a lovely lie in, It's especially nice if the weather is bad, I just snuggle back under the duvet.I’m making the most of it because once my husband retires, I doubt if I’ll get to lie in for very long."},
{"title": "It’s Pancake Tuesday!", "date": "Tuesday 24 February 2009", "text": "I love pancakes any day but I try not to eat too many as my favourite is pancake with honey and lemon. I don’t have sugar but it’s still a bit fattening.Never mind our grandchildren love pancakes too so we have to make and eat pancakes on Shrove Tuesday, the day before Lent begins.The pancake has a very long history and has been featured in cookbooks dating back as far as the 15th century. Pancake Day or Shrove Tuesday, (apparently the word Shrove came from the old English word shrive which meant confess all sins) is traditionally a time to feast before fasting. Apparently it started when Christians who observed the Lenten tradition of fasting wanted to use up all the rich ingredients in their cupboards before Lent started. The humble pancake was the perfect way to use up ingredients like eggs, sugar and fat that weren’t allowed and would otherwise spoil.The tradition of tossing or flipping a pancake dates back just as far and is a very serious pastime for some people.Did you know?• Ralf Laue from Leipzig broke the world record for tossing a pancake by flipping it into the air 416 times in two minutes.• The world's biggest pancake was cooked in Rochdale in 1994, weighing in a three tonnes, measuring a delicious 15 metres in diameter and holding an estimated two million calories.• The largest number of pancakes tossed in the shortest time in the UK is 349 tossed in 2 minutes at Felixstowe, Suffolk in January 1995.• Chefs at the Cooking and Hospitality Institute of Chicago tried to build a record-setting stack of pancakes, but the wiggling, wobbling stack of flapjacks just wouldn't stay put. Organisers wanted to nab a space in the Guinness Book of World Records by building a pancake tower that was 16 feet tall. After nearly an hour of work and the help of some extra-long toothpicks the crumbling stack of buttermilk pancakes never made it past 16 inches.• The tallest recorded pancake stack is two feet, three-inches tall.• Mike Cuzzacrea ran a marathon whilst continually tossing a pancake for three hours, two minutes and 27 seconds.The Art to Pancake TossingIt seems that there is far more to tossing a pancake than meets the eye. According to a study conducted by a senior physics lecturer from Birmingham, the solution to tossing the perfect pancake is down to speed. He concluded that a pancake should be flipped into the air at a speed of 10 miles-an-hour, which means it takes less than .5 of a second to reach the top of its trajectory. I think it just needs a pretty nifty wrist and a good non-stick pan!My husband is the better pancake maker and he made sure we had all the ingredients and the accompaniments yesterday.The BBC website has more information and fancier recipes for anyone wanting more sophisticated culinary fare.Here are some tips and a good basic recipe:Don't use a heavy pan, yes they will cook more evenly but you'll either not be able to flip them or end up dropping the pan. Do not put too much oil in or you'll end up splashing yourself or someone else with hot oil.Stand slightly to the side of the hob, if the pancake falls on the floor you can just thrown it away. If it falls on to the gas ring you've got problems. Be confident when you flip them, you need height not forward movement. Basic Pancake Recipe Makes: 8 pancakesPreparation Time: 15 minutes, plus standingCooking Time: 15 minutesIngredients:4 ozs/110g Plain flour2 Eggs7fl ozs/200ml Milk mixed with about 3fl ozs/75ml water(You can use all milk if you wish)Vegetable oil, for fryingSugar, lemon and orange wedges to serve.Method:1. Sift the flour into a bowl and make a well in the centre.2. Add the eggs and beat with a whisk or fork.3. Gradually beat in the milk, drawing in the flour from around the edge, until you have a smooth batter.4. Cover and leave to stand in the fridge for at least 30 minutes.5. Heat a little oil in a non stick frying pan, tilting the pan to spread the oil evenly.6. Pour out the oil into a dish, be careful this will be very hot.7. Pour in just enough batter to thinly coat the base of the pan.8. Cook for 1-2 minutes until golden on the under side.9. Flip over, and cook the other side until golden.10.Transfer to a plate and keep warm, while you cook the others.11. Oil the pan again and repeat with the remaining batter to make eight pancakes.12. Serve with a sprinkle of sugar and a squeeze of orange or lemon. I prefer honey with lemon on mine and my grandchildren like chocolate spread.Happy flipping!"},

{"title": "Guilty Pleasures", "date": "Saturday 21 February 2009", "text": "I saw the TV programme Guilty Pleasures advertised a while back and I was intrigued. What was going to be revealed here I wondered.“Actor, writer, director and presenter Stephen Fry reveals the things he considers his guiltiest pleasures. These include darts, romantic novels by Georgette Heyer, the work of Richard Wagner and TV game show Countdown”.Well I can’t see anything to feel really guilty about there. I suppose maybe he feels guilty because being the clever, witty, urbane, definitely upper class in my book, ex Oxford student, maybe he feels people expect him to have different ways to spend his time than this.It set me thinking and wondering, what my guilty pleasures are. It didn’t take me long to come up with quite a long list, after all when you’re a Catholic you can feel guilty about anything!So I thought I’d start a Blog off with this, maybe do one a week. If you feel like coming clean about your guilty pleasures feel free to join me.I like a glass of wine, or maybe twoNow what’s to feel guilty about there? Well, when I was working we often went through spells that were fairly stressful. My husband kept saying “How on earth can you be stressed doing what you do?” Charming! Let’s just say as government services are reorganised life isn’t easy.So I liked a glass of wine maybe two or three nights a week but my husband didn’t. He kept on saying I’d end up an alcoholic which irritated the life out of me. I don’t think there are alcoholics who can only drink a couple of glasses of wine and that’s all I can manage.I really enjoy the first glass of wine but for some reason the second doesn’t taste quite as good and after that it tastes horrible. Weird! However it does make me feel guilty that I’m drinking the wine and he isn’t."},
{"title": "Reading and Me!", "date": "Thursday 19 February 2009", "text": "I have a fluctuating relationship with reading. Sometimes I read voraciously and at others I don’t read for weeks at a time. One of the main reasons I don’t read, is that if I find a book I really like, I can’t put it down. Nothing gets done, no cooking, no housework, no sewing, absolutely nothing. Then the guilt sets in and I don’t read again for ages. I wish I was one of those people who can read for half an hour or an hour in bed before they go to sleep. I’ve tried it but it ends up with me up all night reading, I have to go downstairs to avoid disturbing my husband.My main time for reading is on holiday. I’m loaded up with books to read lying on a lounger beside the pool under the sunshade. Not for me trekking about the Roman and Greek ruins in the heat. I don’t mind a little wander now and again to see some sights, but don’t expect me to go on a long day trip anywhere. Just leave me reading.Now I’m not a good reader, I’ll admit to that. I’m a bit of a speed freak. I used to be a good reader but I got into bad habits when I was studying for a degree with all that scanning and skimming. I start off fine but then I seem to speed up and want to find out what happens. I often have to go back to read a section again because I’ve lost the plot, literally. So what makes a “good” book for me? I’ve been trying to suss that out and I’m not really sure. I don’t have a particular genre I like. I can enjoy a detective story, a historical novel, comedy, satire and so on. I don’t really enjoy sci-fi and wild west stuff though.I know when I really like a book because I keep trying to remember phrases the author has used. It’s a bit like moments you remember from films, like James Stewart in Harvey who said, “Years ago my mother used to say to me, she'd say, \"In this world, Elwood, you must be\" - she always called me Elwood - \"In this world, Elwood, you must be oh so smart or oh so pleasant.\" Well, for years I was smart. I recommend pleasant. You may quote me.”I have a few quotes that I can remember from books and believe me I have a terrible memory so it’s no mean feat for me. Here are a couple of my favourites:Bill Bryson’s introductory sentence in The Lost Continent is totally unforgettable and always cracks me up. “I come from Des Moines. Somebody had to!”What a fantastic opening line. How could you put that book down? Well maybe if you came from Des Moines you might.Another phrase is from The Great Gatsby, there were quite a few I loved, but this one always sticks in my mind, “he dispensed starlight to casual moths”.  So simple, but so memorable. It’s all credit to Scott Fitzgerald that I can recall that after over twenty five years.Over the years there have only been a few books that I couldn’t get away with and finish reading. After all I did manage to get to the end of Umberto Ecco’s The Name of The Rose, a bit of a marathon I can tell you. I doubt I would have done that if I hadn’t seen the film which I thought was wonderful and that kept me going. One of the few times the film isn’t a poor reflection of the book.However for the first time I can remember in years, I’ve given up on a book. Maybe it’s because I’m conscious of not having a tremendous amount of time left to waste, after all I’m 64. This book was such a disappointment to me as it’s by Alexander McCall Smith who wrote the No 1 Ladies’ Detective Agency. I loved the TV programme and I had tried to get the book from the library but currently 90% of the library’s books are packed away while it’s being refurbished as a \"Library and Customer Service Centre\", get that! I should have ordered it from another library but I was in a bit of a hurry and just took what books they had by him.The book was The 2 ½ Pillars of Wisdom – The Von Igelfeld Trilogy. Now this book contains three stories about three German professors, I struggled reading the first, Portuguese Irregular Verbs. I read five of the eight chapters of it and I just felt the stories were stupid, not funny and I was thoroughly bored by them. Life’s just too short to be so bored by a book so I moved on to the second one by the same author. I don’t give up easily!This one is the World According to Bertie. Again it’s part of a series, it’s A 44 Scotland Street Novel. Funny how this chappie’s book titles contain a number. I decided to read a few pages to avoid sitting down for a lengthy session being full of great expectations and then being disappointed!It’s a portrait of life in Edinburgh covering a range of moral issues, love, friendship, child rearing, duplicity and more. There are a number of different stories being played out with characters including Bertie a confused six year old boy, Bruce a conceited and greedy young man, Cyril a dog about to be wrongfully executed and Matthew and Pat a couple who are not exactly suited to each other.It certainly was much better than the other book but it won’t make my list of favourites. I’m a person who likes things resolved, even if it’s not a particularly happy resolution, but this book left some of the stories unresolved. Now as it’s part of a series, maybe the stories continue. I’ll keep a look out."},

{"title": "Brenda’s Tag", "date": "Thursday 5 February 2009", "text": "Well I finally got around to this Brenda, apologies for the delay. This is what to do:Share six random things about yourselfTag six people and let them know they are tagged on their own blogFeel free to play the way you want.Well I'm not going to tag anyone, I already feel I've tagged enough so just feel free to go for this if you want to.I found it hard, trying to find six things I hadn’t already rambled on about and things I hadn’t included in the last tag.1. I have a strange attitude to holidays. I spend ages planning them, checking the places out, organising clothes etc. I’ve already started to get out my maps, phrase book etc for our next holiday in May. The anticipation of the holiday is a major part of it. However, once it gets near the date, I don’t want to go. I start wishing I hadn’t booked it. I think of all the things that might go wrong.~ Something might happen to one of the cats while I’m away, well they’re both about twenty so it could but I have a great pet nanny who looks after them.~ What if one of us is ill? Well it could happen and we are in a strange country and we’d have to cope.~ We could be burgled. Yes we could, but that could happen anyway even I we’re at home.~ The house could catch fire and we'd come back to nowhere to live, just like Victor Meldrew. Well as long as the cats were OK, we're insured and everything apart from the cats could be replaced. Oh my photographs couldn't, I should find a fireproof safe to keep them in.This happens to me every time now, I should be used to it. However once I get in the car to go to the airport I’m fine. Needless to say it doesn’t stop me booking another once we get back2. I’m a coffee snob. Well my daughter says I am. I don’t think I am that bad. I have to admit I don’t like instant or filter coffee and only like my latte and cappuchino made from proper espresso coffee machines. I have been known to peer into a café/coffee shop to see what kind of a coffee machine they have. I’m too embarrassed to go in and ask, just in case it’s not suitable because then I’d have to come out again.3. I used to play the violin. My granddad bought me my own violin and I started to learn to play it at school. The main reason for doing this was because you could get out of playing sport and going to PE lessons by going to violin lessons and practising. I hated hockey, netball and anything like that. I was too small and I haven’t an ounce of competitive spirit in me. I also hated school, so when I left at 16, I stopped playing my violin. It’s one of my greatest regrets, I really liked it but wanted to get away from all things associated with school. I love to hear Yehudi Menuhin playing, the sound is so sweet not the horrible screeching I probably made.4. I don’t lose my temper easily. I haven’t lost it a lot in my life because when I do I’m really horrible. One problem is I know I let things build up and don’t speak out when I should, usually because I’m trying to keep everybody happy. The rare occasions when I lose my temper leave me drained, I can’t forget about it, I cry and can’t sleep. What a wimp! Why am I not a bit more assertive then it wouldn’t get to the losing my temper stage?5. I’m a very patient driver. People seem to be very impatient and use the horn a lot these days. I rarely use it because I don’t like it when people start beeping and you jump wondering are they beeping at you.6. I like telly much more than I used to. I suppose I didn’t have as much time to watch it when I worked.I love:~ Good comedies like Jeeves and Wooster, Auf Wiedersehen Pet, Last of the Summer Wine, Blackadder, The Royle Family, One Foot in the Grave, Dad’s Army, Only Fools and Horses, and anything with Victoria Wood and Julie Walters in it.~ Dramas like Kingdom, Wild at Heart, The Royal and Heartbeat.~ Costume dramas like Pride and Prejudice, Cranford and Larkrise to Candleford.~ Police and detective shows as long as the violence isn’t too graphic. My favourites include Inspector Morse, A Touch of Frost, Pie in the Sky, Foyle’s War, Life on Mars, The Rockford Files, Harry O, Monk and for a touch of humour, Diagnosis Murder.What I really dislike are:~ Most sport programmes especially the noisy ones.~ “Reality” TV programmes like Big Brother and I’m a Celebrity Get me Out of Here.~ Talent programmes like X Factor and Pop Idol.~ Confession type talk shows, I can’t stand them, they make me cringe.Now Brenda did ask me to find a You Tube video on hyenas. Well I looked for a clip from Lady and The Tramp where they go to the zoo and the hyenas are laughing. It's my favourite part of the film! Well I couldn't find it. I also looked for something from the Lion KIng which I like too but I didn't pick one of those clips.This video clip is of real hyenas and I'm sure your laugh doesn't sound anything like this Brenda."},

{"title": "Buddy Holly         7 September 1936 - 2 February 1959", "date": "Monday 2 February 2009", "text": "Anyone out there remember this LP?Well this was one of my all time favourite singers, I got the record for Christmas and I just about played it to death when I was fifteen. I absolutely loved it.I was listening to a programme about Buddy Holly the other night, it was commemorating the fact it’s fifty years today since he was killed in that plane crash with Ritchie Valens and The Big Bopper. Good grief it just seems like yesterday!He was a fantastic singer and songwriter and although he was only successful for 18 months during his lifetime, his music was a massive influence on singers and songwriters. He paved the way for the Beatles and lots of other artists. I’ve always thought there was a lot of similarity between the Beatles and Buddy Holly’s music and also the way the songs were arranged. They were always brilliant songs, fresh and sparkling, wonderful catchy tunes with very simple arrangements, just like the early Beatles records.Apparently when Buddy Holly toured Britain in 1958 John Lennon and Paul McCartney went to see him. They also credited him as being a big influence on their music, so if it hadn’t been for Buddy Holly there probably wouldn’t have been any Beatles.According to the programme and I found this hard to believe, is that after he was killed, his music virtually died out in the USA. However he had a cult following in Britain and with his family, they helped continue to have his recordings published. Unfortunately one thing that happened was that the recording studios added a lot of extra background music to some of his songs, so they lost their simplicity. It was Don McLean’s recording of American Pie that set the ball rolling and renewed interest in Buddy Holly’s music in the USA.Well not too long ago I bought a CD of Buddy Holly’s greatest hits and I’ve thoroughly enjoyed myself reliving the music of my teenage years. However it’s just not the same is it having a little plastic case. Nothing like those great big LPs with their wonderful photos or amazing artwork, you really felt you were getting a lot for your pocket money!Well if you’re a Buddy Holly fan too, here’s a couple of You Tube clips to enjoy. There aren’t many original ones available. The first is an original recording with a very patronising introduction. The second is just photos and the song True Love Ways. One of the songs they added background music to."},
{"title": "Thank You Cloody and Frank!", "date": "Saturday 31 January 2009", "text": "Note my new speakers! (lovely Christmas present from my daughter)Just wanted to say a big thank you to Cloody and Frank who pointed me in the direction of using the iPod to listen to podcasts with their Mighty iPod Shuffle posting.I hadn't bothered at all with the iTunes shop after my horrendous problems with iTunes. However I took Frank's word for it and did a bit of a reccie. I found absolutely loads of podcasts there that as Frank said are free to download. All kinds of topics, arts, comedy, music, education and so on.My favourites? From the Education section I've downloaded a whole Spanish course, Coffee Break Spanish. There's French, German, Italian, Japanese and loads more types of language courses.My other choice picks are Wake up to Wogan and Stephen Fry's podcasts.It's absolutely amazing! I'm going to spend some more time researching what's available.Now there has to be a downside for me, there always is somehow. I can't get any podcast to download to my laptop, only my husband's. So I can't download to my iPod as I use my laptop for that. Not clever enough to figure out how or whether you can use the iPod with two laptops. Not to worry I'll just use his laptop to listen to them.So a million thanks to you Cloody and Frank, happy podcasting.Hope the weather is better for you. Take care of yourselves."},
{"title": "Oh Mr Branson!", "date": "Wednesday 28 January 2009", "text": "Below is a copy of the letter of complaint to Richard Branson at Virgin Atlantic. It's been going the rounds and was published in The Telegraph as Is this the best complaint letter ever?Well I don’t think it is because I have a book called The Complainer’s Guide to Getting Even and this letter doesn’t even come close to some of the letters in there. It could be the best letter of complaint about an airline. It’s quite funny, I like the way he write and addresses Richard Branson as Richard as though he knew him. So if you haven't already seen it, read on! Dear Mr Branson REF: Mumbai to Heathrow 7th December 2008 I love the Virgin brand, I really do which is why I continue to use it despite a series of unfortunate incidents over the last few years. This latest incident takes the biscuit. Ironically, by the end of the flight I would have gladly paid over a thousand rupees for a single biscuit following the culinary journey of hell I was subjected to at the hands of your corporation. Look at this Richard. Just look at it: I imagine the same questions are racing through your brilliant mind as were racing through mine on that fateful day. What is this? Why have I been given it? What have I done to deserve this? And, which one is the starter, which one is the desert?You don't get to a position like yours Richard with anything less than a generous sprinkling of observational power so I KNOW you will have spotted the tomato next to the two yellow shafts of sponge on the left. Yes, it's next to the sponge shaft without the green paste. That's got to be the clue hasn't it. No sane person would serve a desert with a tomato would they. Well answer me this Richard, what sort of animal would serve a desert with peas in:I know it looks like a baaji but it's in custard Richard, custard. It must be the pudding. Well you'll be fascinated to hear that it wasn't custard. It was a sour gel with a clear oil on top. It's only redeeming feature was that it managed to be so alien to my palette that it took away the taste of the curry emanating from our miscellaneous central cuboid of beige matter. Perhaps the meal on the left might be the desert after all.Anyway, this is all irrelevant at the moment. I was raised strictly but neatly by my parents and if they knew I had started desert before the main course, a sponge shaft would be the least of my worries. So lets peel back the tin-foil on the main dish and see what's on offer. I'll try and explain how this felt.Imagine being a twelve year old boy Richard. Now imagine it's Christmas morning and you're sat their with your final present to open. It's a big one, and you know what it is. It's that Goodmans stereo you picked out the catalogue and wrote to Santa about. Only you open the present and it's not in there. It's your hamster Richard. It's your hamster in the box and it's not breathing. That's how I felt when I peeled back the foil and saw this:Now I know what you're thinking. You're thinking it's more of that Baaji custard. I admit I thought the same too, but no. It's mustard Richard. MUSTARD. More mustard than any man could consume in a month. On the left we have a piece of broccoli and some peppers in a brown glue-like oil and on the right the chef had prepared some mashed potato. The potato masher had obviously broken and so it was decided the next best thing would be to pass the potatoes through the digestive tract of a bird.Once it was regurgitated it was clearly then blended and mixed with a bit of mustard. Everybody likes a bit of mustard Richard. By now I was actually starting to feel a little hypoglycaemic. I needed a sugar hit. Luckily there was a small cookie provided. It had caught my eye earlier due to it's baffling presentation:It appears to be in an evidence bag from the scene of a crime. A CRIME AGAINST BLOODY COOKING. Either that or some sort of back-street underground cookie, purchased off a gun-toting maniac high on his own supply of yeast. You certainly wouldn't want to be caught carrying one of these through customs. Imagine biting into a piece of brass Richard. That would be softer on the teeth than the specimen above. I was exhausted. All I wanted to do was relax but obviously I had to sit with that mess in front of me for half an hour. I swear the sponge shafts moved at one point.Once cleared, I decided to relax with a bit of your world-famous onboard entertainment. I switched it on:I apologise for the quality of the photo, it's just it was incredibly hard to capture Boris Johnson's face through the flickering white lines running up and down the screen. Perhaps it would be better on another channel:Is that Ray Liotta? A question I found myself asking over and over again throughout the gruelling half-hour I attempted to watch the film like this. After that I switched off. I'd had enough. I was the hungriest I'd been in my adult life and I had a splitting headache from squinting at a crackling screen. My only option was to simply stare at the seat in front and wait for either food, or sleep. Neither came for an incredibly long time. But when it did it surpassed my wildest expectations: Yes! It's another crime-scene cookie. Only this time you dunk it in the white stuff. Richard.... What is that white stuff? It looked like it was going to be yoghurt. It finally dawned on me what it was after staring at it. It was a mixture between the Baaji custard and the Mustard sauce. It reminded me of my first week at university. I had overheard that you could make a drink by mixing vodka and refreshers. I lied to my new friends and told them I'd done it loads of times. When I attempted to make the drink in a big bowl it formed a cheese Richard, a cheese. That cheese looked a lot like your baaji-mustard.So that was that Richard. I didn't eat a bloody thing. My only question is: How can you live like this? I can't imagine what dinner round your house is like, it must be like something out of a nature documentary. As I said at the start I love your brand, I really do. It's just a shame such a simple thing could bring it crashing to it's knees and begging for sustenance.Yours Sincerely.............. No this wasn’t a stunt it was a genuine complaint and according to Virgin Atlantic, Richard Branson phoned Mr Beale and he was invited to help select the next range of meals they serve on board. Apparently he’s thinking about it!The photographs and text reproduced from original and published on www.telegraph.co.uk"},

Milne's story about Christopher Robin and Winnie the Pooh's game of throwing wooden sticks on the upstream side of a bridge and seeing whose stick passes under it first, think again. It's not! We're moving in a totally different direction and adding a whole new dimension and different spelling to the phrase Pooh Sticks.A few days ago I received a letter in the post from the NHS. Crumbs I thought, time for the dreaded mammogram or smear test. Amazing how fast they come around. Unfortunately they're both due in the next few weeks and I'm trying to psyche myself up for them. However it wasn't. It was to inform me I was about to be invited to take part in the NHS Bowel Cancer Screening Programme and that I would shortly be receiving a package in the post.Apparently:About one in 20 people in the UK will develop bowel cancer during their lifetime. It is the third most common cancer in the UKIt's the second leading cause of cancer deaths, with over 16,000 people dying from it each yearThe idea is that the tests pick up problems in people who have no syptoms.The package duly came and included a test kit with full graphic instructions on how to use it. I won't go into detail but suffice to say it includes 6 cardboard sticks which have to be used for samples of you can guess what, on 3 separate dates. As if once wasn't bad enough!Then I have to send it off to be tested. Thank goodness. I thought it was a DIY kit and I might have to do that too. The letter says I'll receive the results within a week. Pretty amazing really!If there are any problems with the results I may have to repeat the test or go for a colonoscopy. I remember Pam's posting about her \"dreaded procedure\" so I'm hoping I don't have to do either. However if I do hopefully it will detect any problems early.Now what else can they test us for? The mind boggles but I have to admit at least they're trying."},
{"title": "“I Hope We Passed the Audition”", "date": "Sunday 25 January 2009", "text": "For Beatles aficionados there’s a programme tonight on Radio 2 at 10.30pm, I Hope We Passed the Audion which is introduced by Charlene Spiteri (ex Texas). It tells the story of the Beatles final, live and impromptu concert forty years ago from the rooftops of the Apple recording studios in London. Around lunchtime on January 30, 1969, a din erupted in the sky above London’s staid garment district. Gray-suited businessmen, their expressions ranging from amused curiosity to disgust, gathered alongside miniskirted teenagers to stare up at the roof of the Georgian building at 3 Savile Row. As camera crews swirled around, whispered conjecture solidified into confirmed fact: The Beatles, who hadn’t performed live since August 1966, were playing an unannounced concert on their office roof.Crowds gathered on scaffolding, behind windows, and on neighbouring rooftops to watch the four men who had revolutionized pop culture play again. But what only the pessimistic among them could have guessed—what the Beatles themselves could not yet even decide for sure—was that this was to be their last public performance ever.Christine Gibson, American Heritage Magazine John Lennon's final words that day provided the group's epitaph: “I’d like to say thank you on behalf of the group and ourselves, and I hope we passed the audition.”"},

{"title": "Thank You Tim Berners - Lee!", "date": "Thursday 22 January 2009", "text": "You might wonder why I'm grateful to Tim Berners - Lee and what that has to do with a virtually empty perfume bottle. Well this scent has nearly driven me batty recently and thanks to Tim Berners - Lee, I can retain what little vestige of sanity I have.This rambling is about scent, (perfume as the posher people call it) and my feeble attempts to track it down, so it could be a good time for those amongst you who are not interested in this topic to jump to the end of the posting and grab the gist. I've given you the opt out opportunity!Well, I've had this scent for years because I don't use perfume very often. I got out of the habit when I shared a room with a colleague who drowned herself in Sunflowers. For those amongst you who don't know what Sunflowers smells like, well to me it has a very fresh strong smell rather like cucumber. Now don't get me wrong, I love cucumber, however I prefer it on a plate to eat, not wafting around me 8 hours of the day, permeating my olfactory senses as though I had a piece of cucumber wedged up my nose.It made me realise perfume smells differently to various people, that not everyone likes your choice of scent and perhaps it's best left to be used in places where there is plenty of space around you, to let the smell dissipate. So I only use perfume occasionally now, when I go out somewhere nice. That's not very often these days. Sympathy for me, Ahhhhh!Over the years I've managed to persuade loved ones not to buy me scent as I am very fussy about it; there aren't many I like. In a previous posting I mentioned having to give away or throw out some very expensive perfume presents because I couldn't stand the smell. Ungrateful rat that I am.Well this bottle is one scent I do like, along with my old favourite Le Dix (Balenciaga) which I can't buy locally now. However I can't remember what the heck this scent's called. I've had it so long and  I've thrown the box away; the bottle top was such a heavy one that kept dropping off and so I threw that away too. It has absolutely nothing on the bottle to identify it. I do know I bought it about 10 years ago in Lanzarote.  As you see I'm not extravagant.Racking my brains to recall it, I was sure it was made by one of the French designers, so that eliminated quite a lot of today's perfumes from the so called celebrities like Jade and Posh. However that was as far as I could go. So I put the bottle away for a few months in my \"holiday\" drawer (where I keep the bits and pieces I only ever use on holiday) so I wouldn't see it regularly and be reminded about it.Now it wasn't so much that I was desperate to buy another bottle of the scent, although I decided I just might, if I couldn't find another perfume I like. As I say I'm fussy! However I went into the drawer for my granddaughter's inflatable armbands and I saw the bottle. Fatal! It started my brain off again, I put it in my handbag and decided to ask about it next time I went to a shop with a big perfume department. I did, and they very kindly tried to identify it, but not surprisingly it had them totally baffled. Well really it was a bit like looking for a needle in a haystack.So back the bottle came and stood on the windowsill for a couple of weeks (well I don't pretend to be houseproud). Today, Lauren, my granddaughter sprayed what was left of it about in the living room and it smelled delicious. I decided there and then I was going to have to try to find out what it is, just on the off chance I can afford to treat myself when we go on holiday in May. Off I went to the Internet and I researched perfume websites where they had dozens of perfume brands all in designer alphabetical order. I checked all the main ones, Balenciaga, Balmain, Givenchy, Saint Laurent and so on but with no success. Then I decided that maybe I had got it wrong and it wasn't a French designer, so I went through the rest. That took over an hour, I hadn't realised just how many perfumes there are out there!I kept wishing that there was an alphabetical list of perfumes with a photo of the bottle.  I felt sure I'd recognise it if I saw the name. At this point I started to wonder whether it had been discontinued. That didn't worry me too much, at least I would know what the blinking scent was called and could throw the bottle away and forget about it. Out of sight, out of mind.So Google to the rescue! I put \"discontinued perfumes\" in the search and it brought up a site with perfumes in alphabetical order. Not necessarily discontinued ones though, it seemed every perfume ever invented came up. Undaunted I started at the letter A, as you do. I worked my way through to I and was getting a bit naffed off by this lengthy but comprehensive search. So I put the thinking cap on again. I decided to do a bit of that sort of free thinking, you know when you let your mind go a bit blank (not hard for me) and see what comes into it, well that's if you're lucky! It kept running through my mind that it was two words both starting with the same letter. Once I got that, I suddenly thought of the letter V. Amazing! I have no idea where it came from. I still hadn't a clue about what the words were though.Never mind I went to the letter V and worked my way through. Eureka! There it was, Vice Versa by Yves Saint Laurent. So would that mean it was discontinued because I'd already checked the Saint Laurent website for their perfumes early on? So I did another search and found a website with information about the scent. Apparently it's a limited edition. No wonder those poor women in the perfume department didn't recognise it if it's not even on the Yves Saint Laurent website. Looks like there are a couple of websites I can buy it from. Well I could if I had £60 to spare. I don't, so that's that. At least it's stopped me wondering about what it's called because I think it would have definitely driven me batty.Now lots of people probably think I am batty, letting something as insignificant as that irritate me when life has so many other problems.  PG Wodehouse called them \"life's banan skins\", love that expression. Anyway I think it's the little things that do get on our nerves and if we can get them out of the way, we can focus on life's bigger issues. I remember at work on occasions I would have a massive problem thrown at me and I didn't bat an eye. I just sat down and thought about how I could resolve it. Yet on other occasions, something really small would get me going, irritate the life out of me and on a couple of occasions I threw a bit of a wobbler!Once I had the information I started thinking about the Internet, how it really helps us in all sorts of ways we couldn't have imagined twenty years ago. How we can meet and communicate across the globe almost instantly with people and how we have the world's information at our fingertips. Information, a mammoth library to help us resolve the \"silly\" little things in life like identifying my scent bottle, useful stuff like researching and booking holidays and interesting stuff like finding the latest medical information, new hobbies and interests.This is where my gratitude to Tim Berners - Lee comes in. Well after all he did invent the World Wide Web, nearly twenty years ago and I'm not sure he gets the credit he deserves for it. Surprise, surprise, in this day and age of computer greed (think Microsoft et. al.) he gave it away free! How altruistic was that!So thanks Sir Tim, I'm really grateful to you and for more than finding my elusive scent."},

I keep forgetting what to do and it takes me so long to check out the instructions, who to give it to, whether they've had it sent to them before and the more people you have to pass it on to the longer it takes.

{"title": "One Foot in the Grave", "date": "Monday 19 January 2009", "text": "One Foot in the Grave is one of my all time favourite comedy programmes. I love it.I’ve seen most episodes a few times and they always make me laugh. I love this miserable character Victor Meldrew, his manic activities and his catchphrase \"I don't believe it!\". His way of dealing with problems is a lesson in how not to win friends and influence people. It’s also good to see programmes which are about older people but I have to say this was one character and series that were popular with all ages.There were times when the comedy was rather black and there were some very sad parts, but I think the best comedy usually contains these elements.All the characters in the programmes are really well drawn especially Margaret, the long suffering wife! I love the droll, sarcastic neighbour Patrick always trying to catch Victor out and also his long suffering wife Pippa, who along with Margaret was always trying to make the peace with Victor. There are times when I feel a bit like Victor Meldrew but luckily the things that happened to him haven’t happened to me. I really couldn’t have coped.I got an email today from the BBC Shop advertising their sale and One Foot in The Grave was one of the DVDs which has been reduced. I took a look at You Tube to remind me about the programme and ended up hooked watching the videos. I laughed so much that despite my intentions of cutting down my spending, I decided to buy the full series boxed set with all the Christmas Specials! No problems when my husband moans about there being nothing on the telly to watch now.Here are a few of the clips I watched tonight. I couldn’t find my favourite which was the 1994 Christmas Special, when a depressed acquaintance drops in and decides to commit suicide in the nude on the roof. Never mind I'll soon have the DVD!Anyway here's a selection. The quality isn’t brilliant and I wish they wouldn't put that laughter on the them, but I hope you enjoy them. If you do there's more on You Tube! Alternatively you could buy the DVDs.Dog Sitting Nippy I cried with laughter at this one, couldn't stop. I kept thinking about Alan Alda and his wonderful book Never Have Your Dog Stuffed.The Victor Meldrew Honda SongThis was an unbelievable script. The three of them spent the whole episode in a car, stuck in a traffic jam one Bank Holiday. It was unbelievable how funny it was.The SkipThis is typical of what happens when you order a skip. Mind I've never had a car dumped in ours."},
{"title": "The best-laid schemes o' mice an 'men gang aft agley - Robbie Burns", "date": "Saturday 10 January 2009", "text": "Oh Robbie how right you were!Did you ever start something and wish to goodness you hadn't bothered? Well just before Christmas I certainly did. My plans took a bit of a scuppering proving no matter how well organised you think you are, there’s often something you didn’t account for.Anyone remember Sergeant Fraser from Dad’s Army constantly saying “Doomed, Doomed! We’re all doomed”? Well I think I am. Just about everything I plan at home seems to go wrong. At work I used to organise huge careers fairs, information exhibitions and training events and hardly ever had any problems. At home it’s a whole different ball game.I get very little help from my husband if he doesn’t agree with my suggestions. I usually have to work on him for months to persuade him about something. If it's anything to do with DIY, he runs a mile. He’s very good at it, just doesn’t want to do it. In our other house he installed a new kitchen, a new bathroom and built a utility room with help from his brothers. Since we moved into this house over 20 years ago, he just doesn’t want to know. He talks me out of everything I suggest home improvement wise, apart from getting double glazing. Well let's face it there would be no painting to do then so I know exactly where he’s coming from. I’m digressing as usual, but just let’s say that when it comes to doing anything, I'm usually on my own!I need a bigger dining table on occasions but don't want to buy another one. I’ve talked about this idea and been dithering about for years, intending to buy a sheet of some kind of stuff to put on my table to make it larger for when the family arrives for a meal. My dining table was fine for many years when there were just four of us but now we have six at least some days and it’s a bit of a squeeze. I don’t want a bigger table taking up most of my small dining room permanently. I already have one upstairs that belonged to my husband’s Mam but my husband doesn’t like it. It would mean dismantling it every time to bring it down and taking our table upstairs. Not going there! What I wanted was a sheet of whatever to put on the table then it could go into the garage when we don’t need it.After looking at all those lovely Christmas table settings on Friendship Tea Blog I was inspired to go for it. I measured the table and worked out what size piece I needed, 6 foot by 3 foot 6 inches. Emptied the car boot, took out the child seat, put the back seats down and checked that it would accommodate a six foot sheet. Easy peasy, plenty of room. Picked little grand daughter up from nursery, fed her, washed and dressed her in glorious party attire and took her back to school. The afternoon was mine to get the table top, do some more Christmas shopping and then visit my step mam before taking grandson to the gym. No problema! Well that’s what I thought. What kind of idiot am I with my track record to think it would all be straightforward. Well ever the optimist!Popped up to the local DIY hypermarket, parked the car miles away from any others so I had plenty of room to manoeuvre, chatted to a nice lady who advised me to buy a sheet of MDF and they would cut it to size for me. Brilliant! Paid for it, they asked whether I needed help to the car, I said no, it wasn’t heavy but if I did, I’d come back. Off I went and then the fun started, You can guess I’m being sarcastic here! I might also add at this point that it was absolutely freezing and there was a pretty strong wind blowing which didn’t help as it kept blowing the trolley away. Also people had parked on either side of me. Sod's law!Opened up the boot only to discover I couldn’t get the sheet in width wise. I couldn’t believe it. The boot itself is really wide but as it’s a saloon car and not a hatchback, the access to the boot is narrower. I hadn’t ever tried to get anything wide into this car before. What a prize wally I am.I had to move the car to a deserted part of the car park to try again because of the trolley moving about. I’m no quitter though. Next I decided to try to get it through the side door as that space is pretty deep. Well not quite deep enough by about two inches! Time to call for backup. Hmm, maybe if someone was holding it I could angle it in. Took the trolley and the MDF sheet back across the car park into the shop and got a nice lad to help me. No joy, he couldn’t do it either, so back across the car park with the stuff again to leave it in the shop.Time to ring my daughter to see if she could help. She has a 4x4 Range Rover Freelander. Rang her at work and she agreed to try later but she wasn’t hopeful. She says it’s an illusion that these are big cars. They’re wide and high but not very long. We met up an hour later complete with grandchildren and had another go. Back out of the shop came the trolley and the stuff. She was right it was wide enough, only just! It wasn’t long enough. Why didn’t I believe her when she told me this? Argh!!!!!!!!!It was getting colder by the minute too. By this time my back was aching and I was beginning to feel like a character out of a Carry On film or one of those video programmes where people do stupid things. If I’d had a video camera I would have taken one myself and got lots of cash. The only thing left to do was contact my son in law who has a slightly bigger car than mine. He agreed to go to the shop later that night and I told him if it wouldn’t fit to just ask them to cut it in half! That was my last choice and then I’d have to think about putting hinges on it. Oh, the pain! The pain!By this time I was so naffed off with the whole process I would have asked for my money back but they’d already cut the sheet to size. Anyway he went back later that night and got it in with about an inch to spare!I used that No Nails stuff to glue some bits of wood on the back of the sheet to keep it in place on my table and it's been quite successful. This was it.I have to say after all that kerfuffle it was very successful. We had lots of space for around eight of us, no knocking over each other's drinks and plenty of elbow room.I met up with a friend I used to work with just before Christmas and we had a good laugh as I recounted my little exploit. A few years ago she had covered her dining room table with a sheet of MDF too as her family expanded. In fact she has also done this with another table in her conservatory. When I said it was just a temporary thing, she laughed and bet me that next Christmas it would still be there on my table. Hers had proved so successful she didn't move either of them.Time will tell, I'm already getting used to the space it takes up as we hardly ever use the dining room. I've also been able to use a lovely linen table cloth I got as a wedding present nearly forty years ago. My friend from Barcelona bought it for us and our dining table was much too small to use it. I never wanted to cut it down as it had lots of lovely embroidery on it. So now it's on the table. Maybe my friend Jill was right and I'll keep the table top in place permanently!My husband wittered on about it at first saying it was too big, it would damage the table top and so on. However I showed him how I had put the wood pieces in place to stop it moving and damaging the table and that the protective cover was in place on top of the original table. He has admitted that it's been very successful and he liked the idea that we didn't have to worry about any spillages damaging the table.Anyway that will be my last attempt at tackling DIY projects for quite a while. I’m not tempting fate! In fact my little catastrophe may put me off for life, it doesn’t take much.To be honest it’s no wonder I’m a procrastinator with my track record of disasters. If this is a measure of my lack of spatial awareness all I can say the world has a lot to be grateful to me for. Just imagine if I had wanted to be an architect or a civil engineer!"},
{"title": "Two Days in One Blog", "date": "Tuesday 6 January 2009", "text": "The past two days have been such a mix of different feelings I decided to lump them all together. So opt out now unless you're in it for the long haul!Monday, as it was my birthday I decided to continue in the holiday mood, no housework, not even taking down the Christmas decorations. That’s a job I hate, the place looks so bare and depressing without the tree and its lights. So I decided to procrastinate with a really good excuse to follow tradition by taking them down on Twelfth Night. Maňana!My daughter arrived at about eleven o’clock with her two kiddoes and she wanted to go shopping at the MetroCentre. I have to say as it was so cold it was probably the best choice for us to shop in an indoor centre. We had quite a nice lunch at a café and didn’t spend too much. Have to say I couldn’t see a lot of bargains that the media have been spouting forth about since before Christmas. Maybe I wasn’t looking in the right places.I had thought about buying a nice winter coat, something quite smart as I’ve been living in jackets for ages. Well you do when you’re in and out of the car with children and it’s been years since I bought a proper winter coat. There were no reductions in Marks & Sparks so I had a look in House of Fraser. The only coat I really liked was a lovely red one, reduced by a hundred pounds, but it was still nearly two hundred pounds. So much for the shops giving stuff away. Most of the stuff I saw in a lot of shops that had sales seemed to have been specially bought in. Methinks these bargains are all a myth.So what did I buy? Not a lot! A new sheet for our bed as I noticed that the one on the bed currently is looking a bit worn. It wasn’t in any sale I might add. I got a half price High School Musical travel bag for my other granddaughter Alexis, her birthday is at the end of the month. My other bargains were three Christmas puddings (I'll freeze them), a box of selected cheeses all greatly reduced in Marks and six boxes of Christmas cards for 60p in Pier which was closing down.That leads to the downside of that shopping trip. I chatted to the lady in Pier about the shop closing, it sells such really unusual stuff at very good prices so I said how surprised I was about it. She said it had nothing to do with lack of sales, the owner had most of his money in the Icelandic bank and also was involved with the Woolworth suppliers. A double whammy so he had no chance. It’s such a shame for all these people.Another really awful sight was seeing the Woolworths shop closed. That’s such a shame too as most of us who are a bit older can remember this shop from our childhood. There was one in every town and you could buy just about anything you wanted there at one time. In recent years it offered really good prices for toys and computer stuff, much better than Toys 'R Us. As the advert said \"That's the Wonder of Woollies\". Well not any more!  Woollies - MetroCentreMany of the people working there had been there since they left school at 16. It’s another bit of history going, there aren’t many shops around now that I can remember from when I was little. What was even worse was on the way home hearing that Waterford Crystal and Wedgewood are also going down the pan. What is really terrible here is that you can replace shops but you’ll never replace companies or products like these because the people who produce them have such specialist skills that are part of our heritage. I remember visiting the Waterford factory in Ireland a few years ago and it was amazing seeing the craftspeople cutting the glass and the apprentices being trained. I know that production in a lot of these places was moved abroad to save money but it shows doing that doesn’t work. Time to look for more bargains as we’ll not be able to buy these lovely items in future.Moving on to last night I was doing some work on the computer for my husband Eric, when one of the cats, Oscar, who had been lying asleep on the settee (squashed right up to me), tried to get up. He just couldn’t get his left paw up and had his claws stuck in the fabric. He started to panic and was floundering about. I managed to get his claws out of the settee but it seemed he couldn’t control his left leg. I sat rubbing it but he wanted to be down on the floor, however once down he just sort of flopped. By this time the poor thing was really panicking so Eric grabbed him and tried to stroke him to settle him down. He rubbed his shoulder joint and down his leg but Oscar didn’t like it and was crying to be put down. Now we were wondering whether he’d had a stroke or something. He was crying and struggling to get onto the floor so Eric put him down and he was fine, not even a limp. All we got was a filthy look from him! Now I don’t know what went wrong, not sure whether he had some sort of cramp or muscle seizure or maybe I had been stopping his circulation in his leg. He must have blamed me because normally as soon as I go up to bed, there he is sitting at the bottom of the bed waiting for me. Not last night, he slept on the bed in the spare room! He’s fine this morning, just giving me a wide berth, so I’ll keep an eye on him. Might take him for a check up just to make sure.Now I would have left it there but life had another problem in store for me last night. I mentioned to Eric that the digital camera I bought him for his birthday in November, needs the battery charging. Got a blank look from him. He has only taken about 2 pictures with the camera so didn’t know anything about it. He got me the manual so I looked the battery charging info up. Apparently it had it’s own battery charger so I asked where he had put it. Got another blank look. I reminded him all the gubbins had been in the box. Yes, it had, but he had thrown the box out last week and had no idea what he had done with the charger, but obviously it couldn’t be far, could it! I’ll add that it was about midnight. After an hour and a half of looking for it, going through all the rubbish from Christmas, including the camera box, we admitted defeat and went to bed. At 2am I was still trying to get to sleep, guessing what it would cost us to replace it and worrying about Oscar, in the spare bed, well on it!Tuesday Morning - Once my delivery chores to school and nursery were completed I was going to go at the housework like a mad woman. However once I have something on my mind I just can’t settle to anything else. Off I went scouring the house in search of the lost charger. I looked in all the obvious places that I would have put it. Well Eric said he had already done that, but I did it again just to make sure. The kitchen drawers were the place both he and I thought we would be most likely to find it. It wasn’t there, but I found a plethora of other charger thingies. Good grief, I couldn’t believe how many there were and these are just the ones that aren’t used. All the ones that are used are in computer bags, in their boxes or attached to what they are charging. No wonder I have no space in my kitchen drawers.  The Charger Collection!My drawer of shame is the top one next to the oven. Here it is. Note the plethora of golfy stuff! No I didn't strategically place that stuff, it's all just there. Drawer of ShameDisgusting! I will say I have tried on numerous occasions to get rid of the stuff but have failed utterly. Well what do you do when you don’t even know what half of it’s for? When I ask I’m just told “Oh put it back in the drawer we might need it.” How would you know when you need something if you don’t know what it is? There are also dozens of keys, for what? There’s lots of golfy stuff, like shoe studs that don’t fit any of his golf shoes, tees, golf cards, covers for clubs and even golf balls. Now if that stuff was mine, I’d put it with other golfy stuff. What would I know!That stuff in that drawer would provide enough material for hundreds of Kim’s Games. Remember the one where someone puts about thirty objects on a tray, you look at them for a couple of minutes, they take it away and you have to remember as many of the objects as you can. I’ll keep that in mind for when the kiddoes are a bit bored. Mind you I’d have to remove all the stuff that I haven’t a clue about or just imagine the list:1. Blue hinged plastic thing that looks a bit like a clothes peg but it's not.2. Thin black plastic thing with a small knob on the end.3. Piece of grey fabric with a screw in a plastic packet.4. White plastic lid for something.5. Metal thing that looks like a long screw but it's not.How hard would it be to remember these! You'd have to be the Brain of Britain to remember 10 never mind 30 I reckon.After another half an hour of looking around every place I could think of, I decided it was time to look in the black hole. That’s the cupboard under the stairs. Finding anything in there is a nightmare because it’s like an obstacle course just getting into it and you have precious little idea of what Eric has stowed there since the last time you were in. No wonder I left it until last to check. I also suspected Eric hadn’t even bothered. Now luckily I didn’t have to look far, climbed over a couple of boxes moved some of my sewing baskets and I saw a couple of Sainsbury’s Bags for Life. Now that immediately shouted “Eric has been here”. It's his trademark.Bless him, he doesn’t seem to have grasped the concept that you buy a couple of these and once you’ve used them you put them back into the car. That way you don’t need to get any more bags when you go shopping, thus helping to save the environment. No, that’s not the way it works in Eric's World. After he's been shopping, he puts the bags away in the cupboard and buys a couple more next time he goes to Savacentre and so on. The result is, we have absolutely loads of these bags and some he uses to store papers, files etc in various parts of the house. I dived on these two bags and guess what? I found more chargers and luckily one of these was the one for the camera. Ye gods, it was like the Relief of Mafeking!Picked Lauren up from nursery, fed her then we watched telly. Her trousers had to be washed because she had sat in some water on the carpet at nursery, she didn’t have an accident! I picked up the other bigger grandchild and fed and watered them both. Luckily they were a bit tired and just sat and watched telly until my daughter came for them.Oscar seems OK but I still haven’t taken down the tree. I'm going to have a bath and I've switched the lights on again, just one last time! Yes, I know procrastinating again but I hate saying goodbye to Christmas..Well I have been busy. Hoping to get the New Year off to a good start and whilst I was recovering from my lurgy I went into action with the knitting needles and crochet hooks.So what did I do.Here's the first one a little cream crochet matinee coat. I bought Ellen a set of clothes that this would match with. I love this pattern, it's one of the first things I ever crocheted. After I left work, when I was pregnant with Neil, way back in 1970 I decided to teach myself to crochet. I bought a crochet pattern book, wool, a couple of hooks, sat down and just did it.I've made lots of these little coats over the past thirty odd years for various babies and it's a lovely pattern. I love crocheting and it's so much quicker than knitting.I knitted a little white cardigan for Ellen too but forgot to take a photo of it before I gave it to Neil to take home.Here's the little poncho I also crocheted for her. Ponchos are so useful, it's much easier to carry babies in these than with a blanket. There are easier than jackets to put on too, no pushing little hands into sleeves, no gaps and they fit nicely around the neck. They fit for a long time too, so she should still be wearing it when she is toddling about. This is another pattern I've had for over thirty years. I've made it for Claire my daughter and also for Lauren her little girl.  So I've made a good start this year, just hope I can keep up the good work. What made life easier was already having the wool in the house so I didn't have to go mooching about looking for it. Wool is hard to get these days, we don't have any local shops which sell wool.The other day I had a quick look in at a big Hobbycraft shop on a retail park when I went to the dentist for a check up. I was horrified at the price of the baby wool. If I had bought the wool for that little cream matinee coat it would have cost me £5.00! No wonder people don't knit and crochet much now."},
{"title": "When I'm 64!", "date": "Monday 5 January 2009", "text": "Anyone remember that song from The Yellow Submarine? Maybe you're too young!Well, now I am 64! Hard to believe, but it’s true, good grief 64, that’s ancient! Well that’s what I thought when I heard The Beatles singing this song.I remember thinking about the Millennium when I was about 20, heck I’d be 55 years old, that’s if I lived that long. I didn’t think I’d see the year 2000 never mind getting to 64.The odds weren’t that good really. For the females in our family longevity isn’t that good. My Mam an only child, died at 48 with leukaemia, her Mam, my Nanna died at 53 with heart failure. My Dad’s elder sister died in her forties with an untreated thyroid problem and his younger sister died before she was 60 with lung cancer. So the odds were that I wouldn’t live to a ripe old age. It just shows that the odds are often wrong. Here I am.I remember this Beatles song and laughing at the lyrics, good grief, people who were 64 were ancient. Have to say I loved it, it was so quirky. You could always rely on them to come up with something different. You could identify who was singing the song, but the songs were never alike, they always surprised you. You never imagined that one day they would be 64. Well sadly 2 of them didn’t make it, my favourite, the lovely George Harrison and John Lennon. Luckily Paul and Ringo did.Well when I look in the mirror, yes I do look ancient, nothing like that teenage Beatles fan. No long, thick fair hair and no slender figure. Sometimes I catch a glimpse of myself in a window or a mirror when we're out shopping and for a second I don't recognise me. Yet I don’t really feel any different, so apart from appearance, what’s changed about me?I think I’m more tolerant of people than used to be. I’ve always disliked that expression people use “ I don’t suffer fools gladly”. It always seems to me to be an arrogant thing to say. So hopefully I’m more patient than I used to be.When I was younger things were right or they were wrong. Now I don’t see things in black and white, for me there’s often a big grey area. Things are not always clear cut and there’s two sides to every story.I worry less than I used to. It wasn’t surprising that I was a terrible worrier in my twenties. My Mam had died and my son had a serious heart condition. I wasted so much time worrying about the future and what might happen that I couldn’t enjoy the present. I try to take each day as it comes and enjoy it. “May you live all the days of your life”. Jonathan Swift.I get pleasure out of ordinary everyday things, blue skies, my cats, cups of cappuccino, nice glasses of wine, music, telly, listening to the birds etc.I am much more conscious of what I eat now. When I was younger I just ate what I wanted, enormous amounts of everything and I stayed very slim. Now I don't eat meat, I eat very little fatty food other than cheese, my main downfall. I tend to follow what my Nanna used to say, \"A little bit of what you fancy does you good\".I take more exercise than I used to but I'm not addicted to it. I tried the gym and it wasn't for me so I tend to stick to swimming now.I procrastinate much more than I ever did. I think it's because I'm much more cautious than I used to be. It's also because as I've got older, I've got more critical of myself and what I do.So what hasn’t changed?I still love laughing and have a strange sense of humour. I don’t always find the popular comedies funny. I never got Friends, Cheers, Frasier or The Office. Like Peter Kaye and Billy Connolly, I think things and people in everyday life are really funny.Here’s an example, last Monday I saw a woman in Aldi doing the weekly shop with her husband. Bear in mind it was about 30 degrees Fahrenheit, no snow but there was a bitterly cold wind. The woman was dressed for winter apart from the fact she was wearing pink plastic flip flops. What was that about? What on this earth possessed her to wear them in this weather? She didn’t look or sound like she had any kind of learning difficulties, there weren’t any bandages or plasters on her feet, but she certainly looked daft and her feet must have been absolutely numb with the cold. I was shopping by myself and I really struggled to keep my laugh in.I still love all the crafts I learned when I was younger like sewing, knitting, crochet, quilting etc. I keep on trying new hobbies though and over the years I've filled the house with \"stuff\" and books on new hobbies like stained glass making, cake decorating and petal paste flower making to name a few. I've promised myself I'll stop and go back to the earlier ones. The house just isn't big enough for any more equipment and books!I'm still a perfectionist unfortunately and I know that if I'm not happy with anything I'm making, it prevents me from finishing it and I just leave it. A friend once told me that was arrogant, so I've tried to be a lot less critical of what I do. I know the perfectionist streak also lies behind the procrastination!My tastes in music haven’t really changed. My first love is still love pop music and dancing to it, if I get the chance. My old favourites come out regularly, Neil Sedaka, Gene Pitney, The Shadows, The Beatles and later ones like ABBA, Elton John, Take That and Back Street Boys. Also still love lots of classical music and especially classical guitar. I can listen to a wider range of music now but I still can’t hack jazz.I still love swimming although I haven’t improved. Still can’t do the crawl. That’s my ambition for this year.I’m still struggling to learn Spanish. I improve but very slowly. I need to live in Spain for a few weeks or months even. Now that’s unrealistic at the moment, maybe one day. Oh yes, that's something else that hasn't changed, always the dreamer!Well enough about me and my aged witterings, what do you think has changed about you? Maybe you'd like to tell us!"},
{"title": "Who Will be the 11th Doctor Who?", "date": "Saturday 3 January 2009", "text": "David Tennant - 10th Doctor WhoWell people tend to love or hate Doctor Who. My husband, children and grandson have never liked it but have to say I've always loved it, right from the first one, William Hartnell.I know it wasn't as hi tech as Star Trek or Star Wars but I really enjoyed it. I never found the Daleks frightening but the Cybermen were a bit scary.I did enjoy the Christmas Special this year on Christmas Day, luckily everyone had gone home and husband had fallen asleep by the time it came on so I got to watch it in peace.I wasn't very sure about David Tennant as the Timelord, especially after Christopher Eccleston had resurrected the role so well. However he's been wonderful and I'll really miss him. He brought something a bit different to the character, there was a sort of wild energy about him, he was funny, quirky but also much more vulnerable than the others. He gave us a bit more of an insight into the character and his problems of outliving his companions.David Tennant is leaving at the end of this year and the new Doctor for 2010 will be announced today. He'll be a hard act to follow. So who will it be? Will it be the first woman to pick up a sonic screwdriver? Catherine Zeta Jones name has been mentioned. Not sure about that one.Will it be the first black Timelord? Paterson Joseph is apparently high up in the betting. He's brilliant and has been in loads of TV programmes, Casualty, Silent Witness, Soldier, Soldier as well as the film, The Beach. There's also David Morrisey from the Christmas Doctor Who Special and James Nesbitt (Cold Feet and lots more) and John Simm recently of Life on Mars fame. Any of these would be really great.As David Tennant says whoever it is, their life will change and it's a really exciting role.Well, all will be revealed at 5.30 pm tonight on the Doctor Who Confidential on BBC1. In the meantime we still have four David Tennant episodes to enjoy.UPDATEWell it's all been revealed. The new Doctor is Matt Smith. Matt who? Yes a young (26 year old) and virtually unknown actor.I have to say I'm not impressed but then I wasn't last time so I'm not a good judge.Well maybe that's a good thing. We have no expectations of him, so it'll be a surprise to us what he's like.Want to see him and his interview? Take a look here. I never make New Year resolutions now and so I totally agree with this warning from MIND the mental health charity.Apparently about 7 million people in the UK will make New Year's resolutions. Those which focus on the need to lose weight or job worries create a negative self image because if they fail to materialise they can lead to feelings of hopelessness, low self esteem and mild depression. Too true!“In 2009, instead of making a New Year's resolution, think positively about the year to come and what you can achieve.\"Their advice?Being active - exercise releases endorphins and even a gentle stroll is beneficial for mental well-being Going green - evidence has shown that connecting with nature can boost moods Learn something new - it will keep minds stimulated and give confidence Give back to the community - it can be just as rewarding for you as those you choose to help Yes! Good practical advice based on common sense!So what could I do?Get back to the pool. I've missed a few weeks now due to the bug and the Christmas rush.Visit the Washington Wetlands Centre that's just up the road from me and I've never been. Could get some good photos too.Go to some quilting classes to learn more about it, play my Spanish lessons on my new iPod speakers and book some swimming lessons to learn to do the crawl.I've been thinking about voluntary work for a while now and what I could do. I'm so tied up with taking and collecting my grandchildren from school and nursery that it's difficult to find the time. When Lauren goes to school next September, I'm hoping to help out at the school with craft or ICT lessons. Another thing I've considered is helping the Mission to Seafarers. So many people spend months at sea away from their homes and families bringing us our food and other goods. This is one area I'm going to explore, even if it's just knitting woolly hats for the moment.Well these are positive things and they're all achievable. However I won't worry too much if I don't do them all. Whatever I do will be an achievement."},
{"title": "Happy New Year 2009", "date": "Wednesday 31 December 2008", "text": "I always feel a bit sad when it gets to this time on New Years Eve. I start to think about all the previous New Years Eves I spent before I got married and how times have changed. All the lovely people who are no longer with us, the good times, the not so good times and the really bad ones. I feel a bit sad to see the end of the year and start to be a bit apprehensive about the coming year, wondering what it will bring.New Year's Eve was a great time for celebration in the North East of England, a bit like Hogmanay in Scotland. In those days it wasn't a Bank Holiday so the South didn't celebrate so much. Hard to believe now.The whole family went about First Footing, going into neighbours' houses having a drink (not alcoholic for us younger ones) laughing, singing, dancing etc. After that my Dad always took my sister and me to my Gran's house. That was his Mam, then we met up with all our cousins, aunts and uncles for more laughing and singing, no dancing though, there wasn't room. What I do remember is hearing Bing Crosby and Frank Sinatra singing Well Did You Ever, over and over again. I can't hear that song without thinking about New Year.Then we sat about and played silly games like I Spy With My Little Eye. It was made difficult to guess what words my uncles were selecting because of the dialect and they spelt words exactly how they pronounced them. One memorable word was something beginning with H. Eventually we gave up. What was the word? Oven, which they pronounced huven. I might add we just about choked laughing. Great times!After that my Dad took us home. Mam and my brother had gone to bed by this time but it was usually about eight o'clock and time for Mass, so we'd set off to walk there. New Years Day was still a Holy Day in those days. When we got back Mam was usually cooking the bacon and eggs for breakfast. I can't remember going to bed at all. Great days!Nowadays people don't seem to do the first footing thing here. We're very unsociable too and just stay in watching telly. My husband is always our first foot. He goes out of the back door at about 3 minutes to midnight with his piece of coal (for good luck), waits until he hears the buzzer at midnight (I have no idea where this buzzer is) then he comes in the front door kisses me and toasts me with his glass of sherry. No staying up all night for us!Well on reflection it's been a good year. If you're still around to reflect, I reckon that's good. Who knows what next year will bring, good things and no doubt not so good ones. Whatever happens you can't predict it. What you can do is be thankful for the people around you and the blessings you have in life.To everyone reading this I wish you a wonderful year in 2009, good health and happiness and in addition I'll give you my Dad's New Year toast, he always said: “Here's wishing you everything you'd wish yourself.\""},
{"title": "Christmas Chaos with the Cats", "date": "Tuesday 23 December 2008", "text": "Well it's Christmas Eve and I have to say, as usual I'm not ready. Main reason this year? I've been coughing and spluttering for the last 3 days. Thought I had escaped the dreaded bug but thanks to Lauren, my granddaughter, I now have the lurgy!I managed to pull myself together this afternoon and tried to do some wrapping of presents. The cats decided to lend me a hand. Now I wouldn't mind but these are no kitten cats.  You can expect chaos from little ones. Tuppence is is 20, totally deaf, has a dicky heart and a severe thyroid problem. The other, Oscar is 19 and I think he is losing his hearing too.Despite some of their senses being impaired and health problems, their curiosity and wanting to be in the centre of anything going on, has not diminished at all. I wish I could have videod it; they just swanned about all over the paper, on top of the presents etc, etc. It was done at a sedate pace, not the flying about and paper ripping of kitten cats, but it was still a pain. Still, I couldn't get annoyed because who knows, it may be their last Christmas. Mind you, I've been saying that for a few Christmases now.  Now, how can I help?Where did I put those scissors? Now I've lost the Sellotape. Oh heck! Here comes Oscar.Oscar, you always spoil the fun!What a bully! He starts to chase her about, so at this point I just give up! Too many cooks spoil the broth as they say.Well it's late, just finished a midnight cheese, pickled beetroot and Pringle sandwich. That'll be enough to line my stomach for the Paracetamol before I go to bed. That way I just might get some sleep.I have a red nose that Rudolph would kill for! Can't breathe very well though, no good for leading a sleigh.In a few minutes I'm going to try that thing I've read about where you rub the soles of your feet with Vicks Vapour Rub before you go to bed. You'll guess I'm at the stage where I'm desperate and I'll try anything! Well Oscar is away up to bed so I think I'll follow.I'll leave you with a nativity scene from Fatima in Portugal. Very unusual! (Source Wiki Commons)Night Night and to anyone reading this I hope you have a very Happy Christmas and a wonderful year in 2009."},
{"title": "Christmas on the Telly", "date": "Sunday 21 December 2008", "text": "David Tennant - The Current Doctor WhoChristmas telly is usually the best TV of the year, apart from Children in Need, but that’s just one night. Well it’s a good excuse for watching so much telly and due to the weather there's not much else I fancy doing. Lots of people don't like watching TV but I have to say I've always loved the telly at Christmas. There's something special about it. I'm glad they do make it special because lots of people are on their own and the telly is their only company.Brit Girl Sarah set me thinking about this when she talked about how the Sound of Music was always shown on the BBC on Christmas Day. I think The Great Escape was usually on the “other side”. Strange that because they’re not Christmas films. It started me thinking about our perceptions of how great Christmas telly used to be “when we were young”. Was it really that good? I think it was, but over time maybe people’s tastes and our expectations have changed.What do I remember liking?I loved to see It’s a Wonderful Life. It’s still one of my favourites. I have to say that it’s not the films I look forward to, it’s the Christmas specials.I used to love watching the Andy Williams Christmas show with the Osmonds. Then there was Morecambe and Wise. Their shows were amazing. Who can forget Angela Rippon, (the BBC’s very sedate newsreader) when she danced with them and showed her fantastic legs in the 1976 show. We never knew she had legs. Morecambe and Wise still hold the record of 28 million viewers on Christmas Day 1997. That was half the UK population!Then there were The Two Ronnies. We laughed so much at their sketches and their songs. Oh how I miss them. I bet Ronnie Barker has them in stitches now wherever he is.So what’s on the cards for this year? Well I’ll give the films the go by, nothing much there I fancy. I don’t watch any of the soaps, I want to be entertained not depressed!So it’s on to the Christmas Specials. They don’t really go in for the variety type shows now, mostly it’s a sitcom type of thing or a drama. Rab C Nesbitt is back after 10 years! Now this string vested street philosopher wasn’t everyone’s cup of tea but he was mine. Maybe I should say lager! A lot of people couldn’t understand his broad Glaswegian accent but he was great. He and his totally dysfunctional family were quite sad but at the same time hysterically funny. Maybe all great comedy is a bit black. Well I’m looking forward to this one.The Royle Family, there’s another dysfunctional family who spent most of their lives in front of the telly. They’re back too. They’ve had some brilliant Christmas specials, the one where baby David was born and the last one which was a bit sad when they killed off Nanna.As Time Goes By is one of my all time favourite comedies with Judy Dench and Geoffrey Palmer. Such witty scripts and wonderful acting. They’re about to become grandparents. Bring it on!Gavin and Stacey is one series I’ve never seen. I think it must have been shown on one of the other BBC channels. People raved about it and although I really love Rob Brydon and Alison Steadman, I never saw any of the programmes. I’ll take a look at the Christmas special and look out for any repeats of the series if I like it.Doctor Who also has a Christmas special. Now I’ve always loved Doctor Who, but all my family hate it. My husband never liked it, my children never liked it and now my grandson doesn't. The result is I can't watch it unless it's on another channel late at night. I've watched them all right from the very first one, William Hartnell. I think David Tennant is probably my favourite Doctor, those tennis shoes he wears with a suit, kill me. However he’s announced that he’s leaving the show and there’ll be a new Doctor Who in 2010. Maybe it’s David Morrissey who’s appearing with him as a second Doctor in Victorian England in this Christmas show. Now how can on earth can I manage to see it?From Larkrise to Candleford is another series I wanted to watch but never got to see. My husband doesn’t like these costume dramas. They have a Christmas special tonight so I bet I don’t get to see it. Unfortunately it clashes with the start of the new series of The Royal, the hospital series set in the sixties. He really likes that one. Why do these TV planners always put really good things on at the same time.Clash of the Santas is one I won’t miss tonight. I love Robson Greene and Mark Benton and their not so friendly rivalries; so does my husband so we won’t argue over that. It seems like I’ll be watching quite a lot of telly this Christmas. Well short days and long nights and you have to make the most of it, there probably won't be much on that's worth watching during the rest of the year.Happy telly watching."},
{"title": "Well It's Beginning to Feel Like Christmas!", "date": "Wednesday 17 December 2008", "text": "What a lovely day I've had today! You don't get many of these to the pound!Started the day off at 7.15 am with a phone call from my son, Neil. He was letting us know that we have a new grand daughter, Ellen. She was 8 lb 2 ozs and came into the world at 5.30 this morning. Her Mam was getting a bit worried because she was a week overdue and the hospital had told her they might leave her until Christmas Eve. Needless to say she was panicking a bit and worrying about being in hospital on Christmas Day and leaving a 4 year old at home. Problem solved, now we have 3 granddaughters and one grandson.Next at 10.30 am met my daughter, Claire and went to my granddaughter Lauren's Christmas play, Whoopsy Daisy Angel! A lovely story about a little angel who was messy and always got things wrong. Well, until the day they asked her to let everyone know about the baby Jesus. She didn't mess that up! Brought the tears to your eyes. As the head teacher said, it's hard to believe that they are only between 3 and 4 years old and have only been in school for about 12 weeks. No stage fright, just amazingly confident little performers.Tomorrow it's the school carol service in church and the Reception Class are performing the traditional nativity play. Lauren's brother's class who are in their final year in Junior School, Year 6 and are the Special Friends of the little ones in Reception, are doing the readings. I must remember the hankies again!After the play we took Lauren home and had a quick lunch. Next we went to buy presents for the new baby. I have always enjoyed buying lovely clothes for my new grandchildren but today was a real pain. It was the same in all the shops we tried. The shops didn't have much left and some of them were selling the clothes at reduced prices. It was hard to find things that matched. If you could get the dress in the right size, they didn't have the jacket! We eventually managed to find a set, just hope that they like it.We collected Nathan, Lauren's brother and went home. Then my daughter went off to see to her horse and left me with Nathan & Lauren. I opened the cafe and started to feed them as usual. Next my nephew Glenn who is a golf director at a hotel, arrived with a Christmas present I had ordered for my son in law. Then in came my husband who was in a hurry to go out to a function. Next my daughter arrived back and we had a coffee together. We had hoped to visit and see the new baby tonight but my son rang to say they were getting out of the hospital at teatime and suggested we put it off until tomorrow. Have to say that although I was a bit disappointed I'm having a lovely relaxing evening on my own with a glass of wine or two, counting my blessings and celebrating a wonderful day. Money can't buy this and God willing, I'll have another lovely day tomorrow."},

Clear blue skies and a beautiful calm blue sea. You might have already seen it, I have it on the side of my Blog. Yes, it's definitely one of my favourites.It's a view of Kalithea Bay in Rhodes from a hotel we've stayed at about four times now. They have great gardens with lovely sweet smelling flowers. The beach is nothing to shout about but there's lots of lovely swimming pools. Oh I'm dying to go back and yippee, not long to go now!Want to join in Skywatch Friday? Just go to the Skywatch website.Gateshead - Newcastle Millennium Bridge I've eventually walked over the Gateshead - Newcastle Millennium Bridge! I think I was the only person in the North East who hadn't! Everyone I speak to has been over it many times but I hardly ever go to Newcastle. If I do, I just go to the main shopping area and never down to the Quayside.My husband was 65 a couple of weeks ago and we decided to go out for a late lunch in Newcastle on the Quayside. Not only was it a late lunch, we were late too. I was walking as I took these photographs, the light wasn't too good and it was absolutely freezing, so they aren't exactly wonderful. I just had to record the occasion!Tyne BridgeThis is a view of the Tyne Bridge taken from the Millennium Bridge. The struts (not sure if that's the correct terminolgy) of the Millennium Bridge are at the top edges of the picture.If it looks familiar, the Tyne Bridge is a smaller version of the Sydney Harbour Bridge. It was built four years before the Sydney one by the same company Dorman Long, Middlesbrough. It's not as dramatic as the Sydney Harbour Bridge let's face it, that one stands alone over a really beautiful harbour.This one was built in what was a highly industrialised area and has other bridges very close to it, carrying the traffic into and out of Newcastle upon Tyne. Nevertheless, it's well loved here in the North East.I think a summer visit is in the offing to get some better pictures!If you'd like to join Skywatch Friday just go to the Skywatch website and post your pictures.I’ve always thought that librarians are stereotyped and get a raw deal. It’s the same whether it’s a TV sketch, film, limerick and in this case a song, Joyce the Librarian.I heard it for the first time on the Alan Titchmarch radio programme on the way back from church. It was performed by Peter Skellern and Richard Stillgoe and I laughed all the way home. As I listened to it, I was reminded of how I enjoy your poems Brenda at Rinkly Rimes Unfortunately I can't find that version on You Tube which is a pity because it's a very good recording. There are a couple of others but they're not very good. Anyway, with apologies to librarians out there, here's the lyrics:Joyce The LibrarianJoyce the librarianStrict vegetarianForty and living with mum.Wears sandals and glassesAttends evening classesAnd wonders if romance will come.Though she'd never been kissedIt's not something she'd missedUntil some weeks before;When George, a rotarian,Handsome lotharian,Walked through the library door. George was unmarriedAnd the torch that Joyce carriedWas burning a hole in her heartShe wanted to show himBut didn't yet know himShe didn't know where to startSo with growing abhorranceShe read D.H. LawrenceTo glean a few ideas . . .Which she turned down flatShe couldn't do thatNot in a million years!! Joyce the librarianStrict vegetarianWas burning with animal lustAlarming sensationsStrange palpatationsA mix of delight and disgustSo she busied herselfRearranging the shelfTo try to control her dreams.Joyce the librarianThe disciplinarianWas falling apart at the seams. The very next dayShe kept out of the wayWhen George returned his booksBut with growing conviction She wandered through \"Fiction\" And threw him some longing looks. And when George joined the queue She knew just what to do, She smiled and removed her specs . . Then looked in horror 'Cause he'd come to borrow \"The Further Joy of Sex\".Perhaps because latterly She'd read \"Lady Chatterley\" Something just snapped in her head; She gave herself gladly, Wildly, madly, To George that night in his bed. But then just as she'd feared George disappeared Some other librarian to woo. Now there's a sob in her voice As both book and JoyceAre a fortnight over due.Richard Stilgoe & Peter Skellern"},
{"title": "I've Lost It!", "date": "Tuesday 9 December 2008", "text": "Yes, I think I've finally lost it.All the running about collecting my grandchildren from school and nursery, taking and collecting from discos and parties, Christmas shopping and generally trying to get cleared up for Christmas has finally got to me.I collected Lauren from nursery and had a few cards I need to get weighed to send abroad. On the way to the Post Office Lauren had a\"boulder\" in her shoe and I had to stop, put my things down on the ground and sort out the shoe problem. When I got into the Post Office I discovered I had no purse, realised I must have put it down and not picked it up again when I sorted the shoe issue out. Went straight back, literally about 30 yards from the Post Office but no sign of it. Just a man walking his dogs ahead of me. Checked the car and around it then went back home to start the horrendous task of contacting all and sundry to report stuff missing.The thought of contacting everyone to cancel cards and then being without them for the next couple of weeks was horrendous. Then there was the bus pass, library cards, the list seemed endless. Just as I picked up the phone my mobile rang and there was a strange message from a man to ring him. It turned out he had been walking his dog and picked up my purse. Yes the same one I had seen! He gave me his address and I went to pick it up and thank him.He lived in the same street as we did when we were first married but had just moved there 4 years ago so I didn't know him. We had a lovely chat talking about what it was like when the houses were first built, we were amongst the first people to move into the street. He loved it there but his wife had never settled and sadly he told me she had died three weeks ago. His daughter was there visiting him and it turned out she lives in the same street as my daughter.He was a lovely man, so honest and I was really grateful to him. He wouldn't take any money from me as he said well it's not mine it's yours. I told him that it wasn't the money, there was very little in the purse, I never carry much. He had just saved me an awful lot of time and inconvenience and I was really grateful. He wouldn't have any of it though.Isn't it nice to have your faith in people renewed. There are some really nice and honest people around despite what we see in the papers and on TV."},

{"title": "Sound Christmas Shopping Advice for Men", "date": "Monday 1 December 2008", "text": "Now I can't take all the credit for this post. A colleague of mine wrote some of it and I added some bits.It's a well-worn cliche that many men put this task off until Christmas Eve - but have you ever wondered why that is? It won't necessarily be because he's lazy or disorganised, no, it's far more likely he just hasn't got a clue and has that \"can't do right for doing wrong\" mental block.We're here to help, so all you worried men out there, read on....Christmas shopping for the woman in your life can be daunting, but knowing a few basics about the noble art of buying gifts for women can help you on the way to a harmonious festive season:1. It's About Her, Not You!This has to be the cardinal rule: Do not, under any circumstances, buy her something that's on your own wish list. So, nothing from the DIY shop, no sports DVDs, no gardening implements. Most women will not have \"Plasma TV so I can watch my favourite footie team\" at the top of their must-haves.2. No Household AppliancesYou might think you're being helpful by getting her a chop-o-matic or one of those nifty new hoovers with a ball instead of wheels, but believe me, go that route and it's highly likely you'll be spending Christmas night in the local casualty department. Christmas is a time for gifts she wants, not stuff she needs.3. Look and ListenTake time to go shopping with her if you don’t already. I know it's purgatory for some men but if you want to survive, just do it. Then watch and listen! Ask around. If she has girlfriends, sister etc check with them. They usually know what’s suitable.4. Apply the Mother-in-Law TestEach idea you have must be put through this rigorous testing procedure. If you think your Mother would like it, forget it. Move on and quickly.5. Big Pants or Black Lace?Neither! It's entirely possible that your loved one just might like some new lacey knickers or a nightie that you would like. But, you must strike the right note - half-way between granny pants and your wildest fantasies should be about right. Another hint, satin may look and feel sexy but.....you slide all over the place in bed and the cat's claws play havoc with it!6. Don't Attempt to \"Do\" FashionClothing may seem to be an ideal gift, especially if your partner loooooves clothes. However, the point is, if she does love clothes, she probably has a very strong idea of what she does and doesn't like, honed over several thousand hours of window/online/real-life shopping. She knows what makes her bum look big! I bet you're no shopaholic! So how can you hope to compete with that level of experience?7. Take Care with PerfumeI’ve thrown out or given away lots of very expensive gift sets because I hated the perfume. Everybody's skin reacts differently to perfume and everyone's sense of smell is different. What smells great on one person could smell like cats pee on another. Believe me I've been there.They produce these amazing gift boxes at Christmas they look absolutely gorgeous and cost the earth. I'm convinced they're made especially for men (mugs) to buy. (Women would just go for the perfume and ignore those other lotions and potions they don't really want or need.) You know the boxes that the wonderfully made up girlies in the shops just love to sell them to men looking a bit lost wandering about in the perfume department.You feel really guilty chucking these expensive boxes of stuff out which increases the annoyance factor too. Unless you know she loves the perfume, don’t risk it. She can’t take it back!8. ChocolatesTake care here. I've received boxes of lovely chocolates at times I've been struggling to keep the weight off and smiled through gritted teeth. So make sure she's not cutting down before you buy.9. Remember What You Bought Last YearAlways keep a record of what you buy for Christmas and birthdays especially if your memory is bad. There’s nothing worse than getting the same thing two years in a row. I should know, I did for the last two years!10. Don’t Wait Until the Last Minute!Definitely not the week before Christmas. The shops are just too busy for you to browse and it’s likely that if you see something that’s just the ticket, they won’t have the right, size or colour. I know because my husband used to get my daughter to go with him to Marks and Spencer on Christmas Eve when she was young. There was usually nothing left!Now for the positive bit!A far better idea is to figure out her favourite shop (ask around or check the credit card statements). Buy an extravagantly generous voucher and then buy a lovely fancy box. Wrap it up beautifully - layers and layers of silk, pastel tissue paper, ribbon, satin rosebuds, little notes in between each layer, a photograph of you both, a couple of luxury chocolates and maybe cinema or theatre tickets. Anything to disguise the fact that basically you wimped out and got her a voucher!Remember, Love Conquers AllThere's probably very little chance you will ever get it 100% right, because we women are a capricious bunch. But, if she can tell you've at least thought about it, and curbed your urges towards the mundane, the easiest option or the downright lazy, the chances are you will avoid the spectacle of your Christmas dinner ending up on the dining room wall.Just show her you care enough to follow the above rules, and I'm prepared to bet my Christmas pudding that you'll see her smiling at you over the sprouts this Christmas."},
{"title": "Seventieth Anniversary of The Kindertransport", "date": "Sunday 30 November 2008", "text": "Frank Meisler's Kindertransport MemorialLiverpool Street Station, London© Wikimedia CommonsI’m ashamed to say that until today I had never heard of the Kindertransport and I have no idea why. I heard about the anniversary on the radio this morning and decided to find out more.It was a very moving event starting in 1938, involving the transport of over 10,000 babies and children, mainly Jewish from Nazi occupied territory in Europe in 1938. Following the rise to power of the Nazis in 1933 the anti Jewish laws brought in led to businesses being closed, their homes taken away, Jewish doctors and teachers not being allowed to practise, harassment and deportation and to concentration camps. Jewish children and students were bullied and beaten and finally banned from schools and universities.The ferocity of pre-war persecution of Jews reached its pinnacle on November 9 and 10, 1938, known as Kristallnacht (“Night of Broken Glass”), when German and Austrian Nazis burned and destroyed 267 synagogues, killed 100 people, smashed 7,500 Jewish stores and incarcerated nearly 30,000 in concentration camps.The majority of Jewish families were unable to travel abroad because of lack of cash and the stringent visa controls imposed by countries such as Britain and the USA. The British Refugee Committee put pressure on the British government to relax immigration controls for a limited number of children. They agreed, but sadly they refused to accept their parents. The Quakers and organisations like Red Cross organised the transport and the first train carrying Jewish children away from Nazi persecution left Berlin on 1 December 1938. The last left on September 1, 1939 - just two days before Great Britain's entry into the war, which marked the end of the programme. By that time, approximately 10,000 children had made the trip.What a terrible dilemma those parents must have faced, sending their children to an unknown future. Many of them did not survive to see their children again seven years later at the end of the war. Of the six million who died in the concentration camps, a million and a half were children.How traumatic it must have been for the children, leaving everything they knew and loved to go to a foreign country and have to learn a new language. It was hard enough for the British children who were evacuated within the country, it's hard to imagine how much harder it must have been for these children. The older children lived in hostels, others were lucky enough to have caring loving foster families although a small number were treated cruelly by foster families. Some eventually went to the USA and Canada.It’s a magnificent story saving over 10,000 children but how sad we weren’t generous enough to take their parents.You can get more information about this story on the following sites:The Children Who Cheated the NazisWiki American website Kindertransport Association."},
{"title": "Tag Backlog!", "date": "Saturday 29 November 2008", "text": "I've got a backlog of tags and a couple of awards I haven't done anything about yet. Apologies to everyone.The first came from Gill a little while ago asking for 6 interesting facts about me. Well I have to say I couldn't think of 6 facts that were interesting, I'm very ordinary. So I have dithered about trying to think of something.Then Patty asked me to name 6 random facts about myself. Next was Patsy and I have to think of 6 facts you didn't know about me.Well I'm trying to rationalise this or I'll never get it done. So I'll try to think of 6 random things you don't know about me that may or may not be interesting. Here goes:1. I'm a Barcelona addict! I'd love to live there for part of the year. I fell in love with it the first time I visited in 1963. I was 18 years old and I went to stay with a penfriend, I still visit her family. I've been learning Spanish for more years than I can remember. I don't get any better at it because I keep stopping. My ambition is to go and live in Spain for a while so that I can improve my Spanish, it's the only way. I look after my granddaughter a lot so at present it's not possible. One day!!!!!La Sagrada Familia, Barcelona (© Wiki Commons)I love this buiding, when I look at it I feel so many emotions. To me it typifies Barcelona and makes me want to go back again. One of these day's I'll write about it.2. I don't drink tea. I stopped drinking it when I was 5 years old but I can't remember why. Now I can't stand the smell of it, I use tea bags for my husband and I try never to make a pot of tea or use loose tea. My Spanish friends don't believe that I'm English! However I wish I liked it because if ever I'm ill I go right off coffee and can only drink water.3. I was a mature student at university. I left school as soon as I could when I was 16 years old because I hated it. After I had my children I went back to studying and when I was 39 got a BA Degree in Geography, Religion and Development Studies. It was around the time of the Willy Russell film, Educating Rita, one of my favourites. I knew exactly how she felt! There were very few mature students back in 1981 but the Polytechnic as it was known then, treated us brilliantly. The younger students thought we were a bit weird but I absolutely loved it. Education is wasted on the young!4. Weird but my children ask me how to use things on the computer. Have to say I'm no expert and have never done a course. I changed jobs about 17 years ago and shared a room with someone who had a tiny little computer standing in the corner of the room. It seemed such a waste as she only used one programme on it and even that was a rare event. My curiosity got the better of me and I stayed back after work to have a look at it. It got to be a habit and I started to teach myself how to use it. That was in the dark old DOS days before Windows! It just growed after that.5. I used to be a careers adviser and I loved it. It's a wonderful job helping guide young people and planting seeds of ideas and helping raise their aspirations.6. I don't like driving and I didn't learn until I was 39. I was doing my degree when they changed the bus routes and I had trouble getting to the lectures, so I had to do it. I won't go on long drives for holidays, I'd rather get on a plane anyday than get in a car. It's much safer!I'll have to look back to find the postings about the awards."},
{"title": "Skywatch - Friday 28 November 2008", "date": "Thursday 27 November 2008", "text": "We tend to think the sun never shines in the UK but it does, occasionally! When it does, the skies are beautiful and when the wind is from the west, it's a fantastic place to be.Although last summer was one of the worst I can ever remember (I can remember quite a few), the sun did shine a few times, the skies were blue and on 9 June I captured the evidence below.This is part of the beach at Seaham Harbour in the North East of England. As beaches go it wouldn't win any prizes, but I like it. I love walking in the water along a beach, any beach, anywhere really, I don't mind. Although I like living in Washington and it's only a twenty minute drive to a few beaches, I miss not living next to the sea. I lived in Seaham until I got married in 1969 and now it seems to me that when I was little, we spent most of the summer on that beach. The summers were longer and hotter, the days were sunnier and the beach was definitely cleaner. Well I said that's how it seems to me.The beach certainly got dirtier because the coal dust from the pits in the area was dumped it into the sea. Eventually as coal production increased the sand got blacker and the water got dirtier. Not a pretty sight!Dawdon was one of several pits in Seaham, it was sunk in 1905 and employment grew to 3,300 with an output of 1 million tons in its heyday. It was closed in 1991 a few years after the 1984/85 miners' strike.All the pits are long gone now, courtesy of Margaret Thatcher and her Conservative Government. The loss of the industry hit places like Seaham really hard. My great grandad, both my granddads, my Dad, all my uncles and my brother worked at Dawdon Pit. The area has never recovered despite the development of new industrial estates.(Dawdon) \"...suffers from severe deprivation, with manyhouseholds surviving on welfare benefits, poor health, poor educational attainment and significant child poverty.\"Dawdon Community AppraisalOn the plus side there has been a lot of work done redeveloping the area. In addition the sand is clean again and the water is much cleaner. However the sea seems a whole lot colder than when I was young! Beach top car parkThey have been doing a lot of work to improve the area at the top of the beach. I think the designer of this wall must have been having a bit of a Gaudi moment. I really like it.  Is this a sea monster? The church on the left of the picture is St Mary the Virgin. It's an Anglo Saxon church dating back to 7th Century. It's supposed to be one of the 20 oldest churches in the country. To my shame I've never visited it. Something I must do this summer and I'll take my camera, if it's allowed!Why not join us at Skywatch Friday and post your photos? We'd love to see them."},

{"title": "Sewing Stuff", "date": "Saturday 22 November 2008", "text": "I like to shop local wherever I can to support businesses in the community. It’s getting harder though. Virtually all our local craft and wool shops have gone. We do have a large warehouse type of thing a few minutes drive from where I live and it sells all kinds of craft stuff. However I’m finding as it diversifies into the trendy scrapbooking and card making supplies it’s reducing the range of some of its more traditional crafts such as the fabrics and supplies for cross stitching.I wanted to buy another Beatrix Potter cross stitch design book in the range I bought a few years ago and some Aida 18 count fabric. When I went last week they had neither. They’ve stopped stocking the chart design books and you can only buy complete kits. That’s a pain because the Hunca Munca design I wanted isn’t available as a kit, only as a chart. They now only stock DMC embroidery silks, no Anchor stock at all.So I ventured online to browse the sewing supply sites. I’ve avoided this in the past for as I’m one who likes to see and feel what I’m buying in the sewing department and often I’ve found delivery costs high. I found one with a good range of Beatrix Potter design booklets and amazingly the price was slightly less than what I’d paid years ago.I also saw some plastic bobbins for my trusty old sewing machine whilst I was looking around the site. Yet another thing the local warehouse supplier has stopped stocking. The down side was whilst browsing I saw some things I couldn’t resist in their 50% off sale.I've only used a cross stitch kit once. A horse and foal picture for my daughter and it was really expensive so I've avoided them since then. However they had some lovely kits which were all half price. I got a sweet Christmas Peter Rabbit cross stitch kit for £5.25, the photo at the top. Another I chose was a gorgeous Me to You kit for £8.00. He's the grey bear with the blue nose below, isn't he beautiful? You also get the alphabet chart so you can customise it. Imagine everything you need including the needle and no running about. I'm converted!Unbelievably the postage was only £1.00 and the order was sent out first class post about an hour after I ordered it. I got it the next morning, that's incredible! Marks & Sparks take over a week to deliver!Seasoned cross stitchers may already know about them, the company is Sew and So www.sewandso.co.uk. If anyone wants to buy from them I can highly recommend them. They do deliver abroad too. I’m not on commission or anything, I’d never heard of them before. I doubt I’ll be wasting my time and petrol wandering about from now on, I’ll be buying from them!Apologies to anyone if I've broken copyright with the images from their website. It was just to let people see how nice they are. If it's a problem I'll take them off if you let me know."},
{"title": "Skywatch Friday - 21 November 2008", "date": "Thursday 20 November 2008", "text": "These pictures were taken last December and the sky was every bit as blue as the photographs show. Looks more like a sky in the Mediterranean than the North East of England! Not a cloud in sight!The foreground is Herrington Country Park. Until about four years ago this was the site of a huge coal heap, the remnants of the mining heritage of the industrial North East. Reclamation has created a park for everyone to use with no worries about running on the grass, that's what it's for!The site is now a great venue for leisure activities such as charity fun races, nature watches and other environmental activities. The Race for Life takes place here every year. It's also a great place to walk as there are lots of trails which are suitable for pushchairs and wheelchairs.There are lots of wild birds there including swans on the lake and the ponds.There's a play area too!Even in the middle of winter lots of people go there to walk or just to sit and eat their lunch. If it's raining they just sit in their cars and take in the peace and quiet.The historic building in the background of the first picture is Penshaw Monument. Here's another view of it taken from the bottom of the hill. It's quite a steep climb but lots of people climb it with children as it's always open to the public.On Good Friday children keep up the old tradition of rolling their boiled (paste) eggs down the hill. On Easter Sunday morning there's a service at sunrise. I have to admit I've never made it!  Penshaw MonumentThe monument was built in 1844 and is dedicated to John George Lambton, first Earl of Durham and the first Governor of the Province of Canada. It was built as a half-sized replica of the Temple of Hephaestus, Athens and is 100 feet long, 53 feet wide and 70 feet high. The Monument is a listed building and the best preserved model of a Doric Hexastyle temple in Britain.The Monument dominates the landscape and can be seen from miles away as it is 136 feet above sea level. You can just see it in the background of a photo, a View from the Bridge that I put in an earlier blog. My husband originally came from Northumberland but he says when he's driving he knows he's home when he sees the Monument.It's certainly a beautiful sight in the evening when it is illuminated but sadly vandals have destroyed the lights on a number of occasions. My photographic skills don't run to getting a good picture of it at night.Why not join us at Skywatch Friday and post your photos? We'd love to see them.  PostscriptI don't know what's going on here with the photos, they suddenly have lines across the skies!They were fine until I made the posting live. The originals are fine and I've reinserted them but they still have those strange lines across them.I'm not going to worry too much as I can see them on other people's posts too. Must be my PC. Weird!"},
{"title": "Skywatch Friday - 14 November 2008", "date": "Friday 14 November 2008", "text": "Evening Skies Over WashingtonIt's amazing the difference in the sky from one window in your house to the next.The first view is one taken tonight at about 5.00pm from the back bedroom window looking South out over the little wood at the back of the house. Looks like there's a fire but it was just the sun going down. The contrast with the really dark clouds and the trees was striking.This one was taken about 10 minutes later from the front bedroom window, looking North. It doesn't do the colours justice, those lovely soft pinks, greys and blues. What a contrast with the colours at the back of the house.I have no idea what the light in the sky was. I didn't see anything when I took the photo so maybe it was a reflection. It could have been a plane heading for Newcastle airport, it's on the flightpath.Have to hurry, off to watch my favourite TV evening of the year, Children in Need. My favourite spot is always when the BBC newscasters and presenters strut their stuff. Last year it was the Rocky Horror Show, this year it's an Abba tribute. Looking forward to seeing Sir Tel dancing with Flavia and Tess Daly dancing with Anton Du Beke doing their own Strictly Come Dancing and a Royle Family sketch.Hope they do a podcast!Had a good laugh this afternoon on the Steve Wright Show Radio 2 when he said that it was mad in London today all the activities going on and the collections. He said the tourists just hadn't a clue what was happening and were looking totally flummoxed. The people involved with the fundraising were in stitches laughing at the tourists' expressions."},
{"title": "On Remembrance Sunday, Thank You!", "date": "Friday 7 November 2008", "text": "Private John Robert LowersonThis is a photo of my uncle Jack, a young lad of about sixteen when this photograph was taken. He looks so young, just a boy really and like so many he gave his life for us all.Sadly, millions of families all over the world have one. A photograph of a dearly loved dad, husband, son, brother or boyfriend who went away to war and never came back. Nowadays it can be a mother, wife, daughter, sister or girlfriend.My Uncle Jack was my Nanna's big brother, only a year older than she was and only 16 when he went to France to fight. He was killed on 1 July 1916 and he was only 18 years old. What a waste!This is his memorial on the War Graves Commission website.Here are some of the historical details about the events of that day and its consequences, extracted from the War Graves Commission website: On 1 July 1916, supported by a French attack to the south, thirteen divisions of Commonwealth forces launched an offensive on a line from north of Gommecourt to Maricourt. Despite a preliminary bombardment lasting seven days, the German defences were barely touched and the attack met unexpectedly fierce resistance.Losses were catastrophic and with only minimal advances on the southern flank, the initial attack was a failure. In the following weeks, huge resources of manpower and equipment were deployed in an attempt to exploit the modest successes of the first day. However, the German Army resisted tenaciously and repeated attacks and counter attacks meant a major battle for every village, copse and farmhouse gained.At the end of September, Thiepval was finally captured. The village had been an original objective of 1 July. Attacks north and east continued throughout October and into November in increasingly difficult weather conditions. The Battle of the Somme finally ended on 18 November with the onset of winter.In the spring of 1917, the German forces fell back to their newly prepared defences, the Hindenburg Line, and there were no further significant engagements in the Somme sector until the Germans mounted their major offensive in March 1918.Sadly Uncle Jack doesn't have a grave, he was one of thousands of men whose bodies were never recovered. His name is on the Thiepval Memorial which commemorates all those missing in the Battle of the Somme. It has over 72,000 names of the men and officers of the United Kingdom and South African forces who died in the Somme sector before 20 March 1918 and have no known grave. Over 90% of those commemorated died between July and November 1916.The memorial was designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens and was built between 1928 and 1932 and unveiled by the Prince of Wales, in the presence of the President of France, on 1 August 1932. Every year a major ceremony is held at the Thiepval Memorial to commemorate those who were killed. I've never visited the Memorial but maybe I should and take my grandson Nathan to see it.I remember my Mam telling me how close my Nanna and her brother had been as there was only a year between them. He wrote to her very often after he left for France. Sadly I don't have any of the letters he wrote but I do have his Bible. It was presented to him by his Sunday School Teacher in May 1911 and Jack recorded the details himself in the front of it. His Bible was given to my Mam in 1933 when she was 11 years old. It's a bit tatty now, it's nearly a hundred years old, the print is so tiny I can hardly read it but I value it so much.When I was learning history at school they never taught us about the World Wars and I don't know why. It's ninety years since the end of The Great War as they called it. I don't know what was great about it! Nowadays thankfully they do cover modern history in the schools and the sacrifices that people made so that we can live in freedom. Children are now encouraged by the schools to wear their poppies. The poppies are sold by the British Legion to aid men and women who are serving today, as well as ex-Services and their dependants. So we wear our poppies with pride.In Flanders fields the poppies blowBetween the crosses, row on rowThat mark our place; and in the skyThe larks, still bravely singing, flyScarce heard amid the guns below.We are the Dead. Short days agoWe lived, felt dawn, saw sunset glow,Loved and were loved, and now we lieIn Flanders fields.Take up our quarrel with the foe:To you from failing hands we throwThe torch; be yours to hold it high.If ye break faith with us who dieWe shall not sleep, though poppies growIn Flanders fields.John McCrae (1915)Canadian poet John McCrae was a medical officer in both the Boer War and World War I. In 1918 McCrae died at the age of 46, in the way most men died during that war, not from a bullet or bomb, but from disease: pneumonia, in his case. Seaham Cenotaph We might not agree with the wars that are fought but it's important that our children do learn about what happened. It's also important they never forget what people have done for us and sadly are still doing today.This morning, Remembrance Sunday, there is a ceremony of remembrance in Trafalgar Square and there will be other ceremonies throughout the country. On Tuesday, the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month there will be another major remembrance ceremony in Trafalgar Square and two minutes silence will be held there and throughout the country.Yes, we will remember them. How could we forget? The Ultimate!This is another one of the pictures I took at Lightwater Valley, Ripon, North Yorkshire.It was such a beautiful day, chilly but so sunny. When I took this picture of my daughter and grandson on The Ultimate Ride I noticed how lovely the sky was.Not sure what the cloud formation is though, I've forgotten all the stuff I learned in geography. Hope I re-learn it participating in Skywatch.This photo doesn't do the view justice. It was beautiful looking across the lake to The Big Wheel which we had just left. It poured while we were at the top of it.We walked around the lake and a few minutes later, whilst we were standing in the rain, the sun started to come out over the Big Wheel. Just wish I was a better photographer.Roll on summer I love those blue skies and white fluffy clouds."},
{"title": "My Fun Fair Phobia", "date": "Sunday 2 November 2008", "text": "I’m not a fan of fun fairs, in fact it's almost a phobia. I’m not exactly sure why, but my instinctive response is to cringe when anyone asks me to go to one and I always refuse.I’m sure I enjoyed them when I was little, when you see the coloured lights, the candy floss and toffee apples, it all looks so good. I remember my grand dad taking me to one at a nearby seaside town and I still have the photo. Poor soul it doesn’t look like he was enjoying it much with 3 small children complete with candy floss in tow.As I got a bit older I started to see them as tacky places full of scruffy blokes, tattoed with greasy Brylcreemed hair and pierced ears, (before these became fashionable) twirling the waltzers. It shows I had stopped seeing the world through those rose tinted glasses and also the standard of the travelling funfairs we had in those days!One really awful experience I had was when I was first going out with Eric (eventually my husband) and we decided to go to The Hoppings in Newcastle. It’s a huge event where lots of travelling fun fairs gather together for a couple of weeks in the summer. To be truthful the experience was nothing to do with the fun fair at all, just the fact that we had been there. When we got back to the car, Eric couldn’t find his car keys and he called the RAC out. Instead of taking us to a garage to get a new key, the prat started the car up himself. The car jumped and banged all the way home. I have no idea what he did but it cost a lot get the car repaired. Big fun fair psychological damage!On the fun fair plus side, about thirty years ago, when our children were young, we went on holiday to Sweden. Neil and Claire persuaded us to visit the Liseberg Amusement Park in Gotenberg and it was great. Clean, safe, in a lovely setting and it was staffed by young people who were extremely polite and dressed in yellow uniforms. I’ve also seen the glorious ads for Disneyland, Disney World, Port Aventura, Alton Towers etc but my response is still the same, I don’t want to go.Last week my daughter asked me to go to with her to Light Water Valley, a fun park about an hour drive from where we live. My initial response was no. However she had already bought the tickets and it was the last day it would be open until next year. She didn’t want to go on her own with 2 children of quite different ages wanting to go on different rides. Her husband didn’t want to go either. She knows I’m a soft touch and love spending time with them, so I agreed, reluctantly.Well the weather forecast was quite good so off we went and arrived there at about 10.30am. It was a glorious autumn/winter day and the funfair is set in a lovely country park area near Ripon in North Yorkshire, not at all tacky. The rides were well spaced out in the park, yes a real park not just a name. There were very few people around too so the children could just walk onto any of the rides with no qeueing. Great! Ah Sweet! (They're not always like this!)The weather was great for most of the day. It was chilly but the sun warmed things up a lot. At one point there was some rain but luckily it didn't last. Big Wheel in the RainNow I gave up riding the waltzer a long time ago but I have to say I took a real fancy to getting onto what they called the Skyrider. It was what we used to call \"chairs\" when I was little. However this one was different! A lot bigger, faster and as you can see from the photo it had a tilt to it. I have to say it was almost a work of art. I admired the colours, the lights and the designs on it, not at all tacky.My grandson loved it and kept going on over and over again as there were no queues. I have to admit that I was sorely tempted to get on with him but I had been left carrying the coats, bags etc. whilst my daughter took Lauren onto the rides for younger children. It was probably just as well, I might not have lived to regret getting on it. What a wimp!The SkyriderNever mind I really enjoyed listening to the music, all 'sixties stuff. I hadn’t realised how well suited Telstar was to fun fairs. Spot on!I wasn’t the only one feeling their age. My daughter took Nathan onto one ride called The Ultimate and hurt her neck. She thinks it will be her last time on a roller coaster ride, after all she’s 35! Another wimp in the family.Roll on next summer, we'll be back now that I'm getting over my fun fair phobia."},
{"title": "They’ve Lost the Plot!", "date": "Thursday 30 October 2008", "text": "I’m wondering what on earth is going on with the press and TV.I watched the news at lunchtime with a sense of wonder. Yes, wonder at what’s going on with the media here in the UK.So what was on the news?Well, there was an inspiring item about a soldier who received the George Cross from the Queen today. In Afghanistan he had thrown himself onto a live grenade to shield the other members of his patrol. Amazingly he survived! Was this the top story? No, it got a short mention near the end.There was another story about hundreds of soldiers marching through Colchester to honour 15 service personnel killed in Afghanistan. No this came at the end of the news.Then there was the Jean Charles de Menezes inquest where witnesses were giving evidence about the lack of warnings given by the police before they shot Jean Charles in the head on the Tube. No, not the top story.What about the economy and the fears for the success of largest shopping centre in Europe that’s just opened near London? No!The freak hail and floods in Devon? No!The UN fears about thousands of people fleeing from rebels in the Congo? No!The Pakistan earthquake? No!The election in the USA? No, no, no! None of these.The main story the press have had a feeding frenzy with, is the one about DJs, Jonathan Ross and Russell Brand and the prank calls they made to actor Andrew Sachs on their Radio 2 show. Yes, they are grown men, grossly overpaid and they behaved like a pair of puerile boys, stupid and very nasty. It's sad that this type of thing passes for cutting edge humour with the young these days. However to make this the main story for three days is ludicrous when you consider what else is happening in this country and the rest of the world. I have no doubt the main story will be exactly the same tomorrow as the resignations and suspension are commented on.Who decides what makes the main news stories these days? Makes you wonder! I think they’ve definitely lost the plot.Me? I'm losing the will to watch the news on TV or read the papers! OscarThis is my lovely little fellow Oscar.He's getting on a bit now. In the photograph above he was sixteen, now he's nineteen. Like Cary Grant he carries his age well.These photographs are from a couple of days ago and he doesn't look a day older! What's going on now?Please tell me it's not the grandchildren here again.False alarm thank goodness. Just her with the camera. Does she never give up? It's such a hard life being a cat.In this weather all he wants to do is sleep. Trying to get an active picture of him proved impossible. I'll be back!"},

{"title": "Chocaholic Alert!", "date": "Monday 27 October 2008", "text": "Hot Chocolate Fondant Pudding with a Gooey CentreNow I’m not a chocaholic. Not that I refuse a Thornton’s Continental when one is offered or a Cadbury’s Flake. I do enjoy chocolate, milk chocolate, now and again. I just don’t crave it and I never buy it for myself, only for my grandchildren.Nathan and Lauren, my grandchildren love chocolate and they love chocolate cake and pudding. So when I watched TV chef Phil Vickery on the TV programme, This Morning, making these chocolate puddings, I knew I had to try the recipe for them. The recipe is here along with a video of the chef making the puddings. There are a couple of ads first and a brief description of the different types of chocolate. The video and instructions are very good.Link to video and recipehttp://www.itv.com/Lifestyle/Food/ThisMorning/Recipes/Hotchocolatefondant/default.htmlI made the puddings and they were fabulous!A few things to note before you try this:1. My mixure made more than 6 puddings, I ended up with 9. Maybe my ramekin dishes are smaller than the ones on the programme. When I make this again I’ll halve the ingredients and still get at least 4.2. Eat them immediately. They go a little hard if you don’t. As they tell you in the video you can leave the mix in the ‘fridge for a while before you bake it. Just add a couple of minutes to the cooking time.3. They are delicious but very rich. I could only eat half of one pudding. Wish I’d had some crème fraîche to take the edge off. So be warned!Well I have to say I've never thought of myself as awesome.  The Pyramids, Grand Canyon, Taj Mahal and Durham Cathedral, now they fall into the category of awesome.However Renie Burghart got in touch and told me that she and I, along with Grannie Annie had been nominated as \"Awesome Grandmas Who Blog\" by Lemondrop. How on earth did they find out about us? There must be millions of Bloggers out there. Amazing!What's strange is that Lauren Bohn who wrote the article said that only 5% of bloggers are over 50. So we are in the minority yet we have more time for blogging than younger people. Maybe we need to spread the word more. Have to say I don't know anyone else who Blogs young or older. Younger people in my family use Facebook and other social networking sites but I'm not keen on them. I prefer the diary style of blogging.Lauren Bohn asked for recommendations of other grandma bloggers, so just to let you know I've nominated a lot more grandmas who blog. Keep an eye out you might be in there soon."},
{"title": "Special Friends!", "date": "Saturday 25 October 2008", "text": "Yesterday I went to my grandson Nathan's school assembly. He’s 10 and in Year 6, his final year at primary school. The assembly was to celebrate the Special Friends project that his school has been running for a long time now. The school’s motto is “caring, sharing and helping others” and this project is one of the ways that the motto is put into action.The children in their final year who are 10 - 11 years old are paired up with children in the Reception class, aged 4 – 5 years, who are just starting their school life. They spend time together every day, getting to know each other, showing the little ones around the school and playing together. Every Friday the two classes look forward to spending their last lesson of the day playing together. They play football, rounders, jump on space hoppers and pogo sticks and they play the traditional games like ring a ring a roses, hopscotch etc and generally get to know each other. It’s a great idea where the little ones know they have someone who’ll always look out for them and help them if they have any problems. The older ones enjoy the responsibility given to them, caring for and sharing time with the little ones, not to mention going back to playing the games they enjoyed when they were small. Fun is the order of the day!The assembly was amazing, very informative, it made you laugh and also brought a tear to your eye as the children showed us what being a Special Friend is all about. They sang hymns and songs, acted a short parable of sharing, read poems and told us in their own words what it meant to them.I remember when Nathan started this school 6 years ago and how he often talked about his Special Friend Paul who was 10. Paul was obviously important to Nathan and he still has the teddy bear that Paul bought him that first Christmas in his new school. I didn't know much about the Special Friend scheme then or how important it is in the school and to the children. The OfSTED school inspection picked up on the ethos of the school and commended the Special Friend scheme in their final report. The school is one of the top primary schools in the City. Now it’s Nathan’s turn to take responsibility for his Special Friend, Benedict. Nathan talked about Benedict even before he met him in September; it was obviously something the school prepared them for. We met Benedict, his Mam and baby brother on Friday, they are lovely. Benedict was very shy with Nathan at first but that’s changing and his confidence in school is developing. The relationship is obviously an important one to them both and I think Nathan enjoys having a little boy to play with. Much more fun than a little sister! I look forward to hearing about what they are doing over the next year.I don’t know whether the new school Nathan will move to next year operates anything like this. It would be great if they do, but it’s a huge school and it may be difficult to organise. However it’s possibly needed more there than in the primary schools. That move to secondary school is a very difficult one, the schools are huge and the age range is 11 to 18. Maybe he’ll even meet up with his special friend Paul who will be in his last year in 6th form then. Who knows?Next year it will be Lauren, Nathan’s little sister’s turn, when she joins the Reception class. I look forward to going to her Special Friends' Assembly in 2009 and meeting her new Special Friend!"},
{"title": "Metric Madness to Stop!", "date": "Saturday 18 October 2008", "text": "Now I give you fair warning, this one is a bit of a rambling rant, getting a lot of things off my chest so to speak. So unless you're in it for the long haul, stop now.Last September Brussels abandoned its policy of forcing Britain to sell food using only metric measurements. For some reason best known to themselves, some councils still persisted in prosecuting traders for selling their goods in imperial measurements and not metric.Ye gods! As if they hadn’t more important things to worry about like reducing council tax, improving schools and school meals, improving leisure facilities, homes for the aged etc. Let’s face it, the list is endless. However thank goodness sanity is prevailing in this country and the government is going to introduce guidelines to prevent local authorities taking traders who sell food in imperial measurements to court. Apparently John Denham, the Innovation Secretary (what on earth is that?), said:\"It is hard to see how it is in the public interest, or in the interests of consumers, to prosecute small traders who have committed what are essentially minor offences.\"Well now, it doesn’t take a Ph.D in logic to work that one out, does it? Good grief! Is it me that’s being thick here? Can someone tell me why on earth has it taken two governments over thirty years and a number of court cases for them to see the light?Remember the Ministry of Silly Walks in Monty Python? Well I think somewhere in Whitehall, there must be a Ministry of Silly Weights and Measures. Well a Department as they call them now, much posher than Ministries. There’s probably a think tank too, they always have them. They generally come up with the blindingly obvious or the absolutely stupid. Unfortunately the things that they usually recommend are the absolutely stupid that cost a fortune, the professionals tell them it won’t work and they ignore them. After all government researchers and civil servants always know better than the professionals, don’t they?I once had the cheek to ask a very senior civil servant who was trying to justify cutting a large section of a department, how he knew enough to be able to do that (he came from a totally different government department). I could do that as I didn't work for the department and had been called in as an objective witness during the farce they called a consultation process. Anyway he said “Oh we just go on a steep learning curve!\" Steep learning curve my bum, he was just a hit man sent in. That pratt knew the price of everything and the value of nothing.Getting back to local councils, you’d think that they would have better things to do with our hard earned mammoth council tax payments than take petty European Law infringements to court. In any case, it’s such a mess because there’s no consistency in metric application. If you buy a computer or TV, the screen is measured in inches, the road signs still have distances in miles on them and the speeds are all in miles per hour. Well that’s another thing, the speed signs just have numbers in a red circle. They are miles per hour but how are tourists and anyone else expected to know that? Oh we’re all psychic, that’s it.So why did they go berserk on weights? Are there some council employees totally obsessed with metric measurements, wandering round our shops and pouncing on poor local shopkeepers to check whether they're selling their potatoes by the pound or the kilo? As if the shopkeepers didn't have enough problems competing with the giant supermarkets! These people would have been better employed checking out the horrendously dangerous toys imported every year, usually from China! Now that would have been useful.Our council, Sunderland, was the first council in the country to take a market trader to court over this. What a wonderful thing to be famous or rather notorious for. Have to say I‘m watching how they spend my Council Tax more closely now.I know they’ve been teaching metric in schools since the seventies and my children (38 and 35) along with millions of others haven’t a clue what a yard or a pound looks like. Mind you a lot of them wouldn’t know how many grams there are in a kilo either.However the majority of people in the UK do know their yards feet and inches. Most of us still want to buy our fruit by the pound, not the kilo and our petrol by the gallon, not the litre. I think that petrol prices are shown in litres to deliberately disguise the real cost. If we bothered to convert it to gallons we’d all have heart attacks. Now if my maths is right, that’s nearly £4 a gallon. Maybe we’d be rioting at the petrol pumps if we saw the price per gallon. No, I think not! We’re too lethargic.I often wonder what it would take to get us British off our behinds and start shouting. We just sit and mutter and moan instead of doing something about what’s irritating us. I’m guilty; I stand in queues muttering inwardly about people jumping the queue in shops and in pubs. Well mainly on holiday in Greece and Spain where some nationalities just haven’t grasped the fairness of “taking your turn”. Mind you, my theory is that we British cultivated queuing to a fine art during the war and we haven’t lost the habit. If we see a queue we think we're missing out on something.Councils often make decisions that go against everything they’re saying they’re for. For example over the past five years they’ve installed new street lights in about 75% of the area where I live. We had one outside our house which seemed perfectly OK to me but they renewed it and installed more lights than we originally had in the street. Apparently it reduces crime and makes people feel safer which is fair enough. However they've also installed lots of new lights on main roads that have never been lit before. I don't know why they need them, they're straight dual carriageways. I thought they were trying to reduce carbon emissions. You can't do both. Now I’m really sounding like a grumpy old git!Getting back to the mad metric scenario, it’s not like the traders are trying to rip us off. If that was happening, most of us would be more likely to see that in imperial than metric. You can visualise what two pounds look and feel like. I can anyway! Well I should, for the first forty years of my life it was a bag of sugar. I remember a trip to Brittany many moons ago when we wanted to buy some pate (in the days when I still ate meat). I had to work out how to buy a portion. Well it was a small place with no supermarkets and the locals either spoke no English or refused to. I never found out which but probably the latter.All I wanted to buy was enough for us to eat with a baguette for lunch. Now at home I would have asked for about a quarter of a pound but I hadn’t a clue what that would be in metric. Added to that was the problem I only spoke about 6 words of French which I had picked up that week. I learned Latin and Spanish at school which was a fat lot of good in Brittany!Now I don’t go in for sign language, so I had to speak. I guessed that pate was also pate in French. No flies on me! Two of the words I knew were medio and kilo. Yes, that’s what I did, ask for half a kilo of pate. The woman serving looked at me as though I were a loony. No wonder! Little did I know I was asking for over a pound, anyway we ate it all. When I think about it, that could have been the trigger for me giving up eating meat.Well needless to say we’ve never been back to France! It’s a beautiful country I know, but apart from other issues I have, the drivers are all lunatics. Calais was sheer unadulterated hell. Since then, if we’ve ever gone on a self catering holiday we’ve stuck to Spain and gone by air. Can’t be done with the driving on the wrong side of the road. Too risky having to rely on children shouting “keep to the right” every time you come out of a garage or onto a main road. Anyway you can get to Barcelona by air in the time it takes you to drive to London and for the cost of petrol down to Dover. So what's the point in taking the car, too time consuming, expensive and risky. They have fantastic fresh food in local markets and supermarkets in Spain. You can just pick up what you want and for the things you can't pick up, I get by with my appalling Spanish. The locals go out of their way to help if you try to speak their lingo. They’re amazed and delighted that at least one English person doesn’t expect everyone in the world to speak English for them and even if my Spanish is pathetic, it makes them smile. I probably sound like the Englishman posing as a gendarme in ‘Allo, ‘Allo saying Good Moaning instead of Good Morning.Now that I’ve decided to take up quilting again I hope that I can look forward to being able to buy my fabrics in yards and inches again. I won’t hold my breath though, it’ll probably take years to communicate to businesses that it’s OK now to sell in Imperial. After all there’s probably no one left working who knows Imperial measurements unless they’re over forty. And there’s another thing, why is this country so hell bent on applying European Law when other EU countries totally ignore it when it suits them? Take Spain and the fishing quotas, everyone knows they ignore them. Nothings happens about it. France blatantly ignored EU legislation over importing British beef. Nothing happened about it. So why do we always have to toe the line?Maybe we have too many bureaucrats and jobsworths in the UK who when given a modicum of power it just goes straight to their heads. Unfortunately it doesn’t engage with their brains.I like the quote below:“A bureaucrat is the most despicable of men, though he is needed as vultures are needed, but one hardly admires vultures, whom bureaucrats so strangely resemble. I have yet to meet a bureaucrat who was not petty, dull, almost witless, crafty or stupid, an oppressor or a thief, a holder of little authority in which he delights, as a boy delights in possessing a vicious dog. Who can trust such creatures?”Seems very appropriate and yet it came from Marcus Tullius Cicero nearly 2,000 years ago.Funny isn’t it, no matter how much things change, some things remain the same."},

Also a great day for blowing bubbles with Lauren. Sorry the bubbles don't show in the photo. In fact we got so engrossed I forgot about the spaghetti I had put on to cook for her.Funny how the simple things can give you a lot of pleasure and even save you money. Well apart from when you burn the spaghetti!When the children were small I had to hang the washing out, we didn't have a tumble drier. In the days before disposables, I used to love to watch those lovely white nappies blowing on the line, even though my fingers were freezing in winter.Years later, when I went out to work, I used the tumble drier as often as I could justify, to save me time. Couldn't count how many times I hung the washing out before I went to work because it was a lovely day, then I came back to find it soaked.Now that I've left work and I'm taking life at a different pace, I enjoy going outside to hang out the washing. I don't even mind going out in winter as long as it's fine and windy. I look at the garden, listen to the birds, look at the sky and clouds, have a chat with the cats and then enjoy watching the washing blow from the kitchen window. Very theraputic!When I take it back in the fresh smell is absolutely wonderful and I know I've not only saved some money but I'm being green and helping to save the planet. There's no doubt about it. The BBC really know how to spoil a party.Today is the official celebration for the Beijing Olympic and Paralympic teams in London and what a reception they are getting. Well from everyone except the BBC.They showed the celebrations live and everyone was really enjoying themselves, later they'll go to Buckingham Palace for a reception with the Queen. Nice!However the chap interviewing Chris Hoy (complete with his 3 gold medals) on the Olympic doubledecker bus, couldn't resist asking him how he felt about the possibility that the funding for sportsmen and women would be cut for the 2012 London Olympics. Think I would have slapped him!Nice one BBC. It's official, you are spoilsports!You should be ashamed of yourselves."},

{"title": "The iPod Saga Continues", "date": "Tuesday 14 October 2008", "text": "My iPodNow just look at it sitting there. Pretty little thing isn’t it? Sounds great too for such a small piece of equipment. It's really small, my car key is longer!However that's where my admiration ends. It’s amazing how it can be such a real pain to get the music onto it, thanks to iTunes.Now I’m no quitter, I’m determined I’m not going to let iTunes beat me. I’ve been trying for almost a whole week to put some more CDs onto the computer but it’s such tortuous process. A real pain in the bum!It's still putting some songs into different folders. Michael Jackson’s Number Ones went into 18 separate folders. So I decided I can live without that on the iPod and took it off.Still not finding the art work either and it’s so slow. It often freezes totally and I daren’t use any other programs with it. So much for the multi-tasking concept, iTunes puts the mockers on that!Decided to check out whether other people are having problems. First my son-in-law who has all his music on his iPod. He says he has the same problem with the art work but it doesn’t bother him. Well I can't ignore it, looks horrible. I know I'm a bit of a perfectionist but I hate those blanks. So I’ll have to keep going onto the Internet to find it and manually add it. How come if iTunes is the major online music store they can’t find half my records when they’re all still available to buy?He has had a different problem with iTunes though, has lost half his music from the laptop! Hasn’t a clue how it happened. Now he has to figure out whether he can get it back from the iPod onto his computer. Hopefully I won't have that problem, but if I do, my backup drive should put them back. Tried my son next. His comment about iTunes was, “It’s total pants!” He’s about to buy a new MP3 player, one that he can use his Windows Media Player with. Looks like I'm not the only one who has problems.So Apple, (the company that is world renowned for its design of computers), if you can design such nice looking music hardware, why the heck can’t you go the whole hog and get the software to work properly?"},

{"title": "Dither of the Day - 7 October 2008", "date": "Wednesday 8 October 2008", "text": "A View from the Bridge (Fatfield Bridge)Well, it’s the first day I've got out of bed before lunchtime since Saturday! Been in bed for most of the past 3 days due to some kind of bug. Thought it was just a cold that was getting better but it turned into something else plus a severe face-ache, headache and feeling sick.I'm feeling lots better so I ponder to myself, once I've dropped the kiddiwinks off at school and nursery, whether to:1. Go straight back home to immerse myself in clearing up the devastation of the past 3 days in bed (husband has just ignored it).or2. Enjoy the fact it’s a glorious day, have a bit of a wander and take some nice photos in my 2 hours of freedom before I pick up my granddaughter from nursery.Dither, dither, dither. On the one hand the house would be there when I wasn’t as my Mam used to say. So why not go and enjoy what might be the last brill’ day before winter really sets in. On the other hand, the house was a real tip, or to quote my Mam again “like Stageybank Fair”, (not that I ever knew where that was but I gather it must have been a real hole).Well after a traumatic hour breakfasting and getting 2 grandchildren ready, by the time I dropped them off at school and nursery, the choice wasn’t a hard one to make. The fresh air won out.In theory I should have left the car at home, but it’s quite a bank to walk up on the way back and not feeling particularly perky, I gave in and took the car.I often think the place we live in isn’t particularly pretty. The town centre is an awful ‘sixties concrete design typical of UK New Towns. Like most towns we complain that the council doesn’t do enough to improve the environment and some of the residents don’t help. We get our fair share of idiots dumping supermarket trolleys, despite all the schemes they put in place to stop it. However one of the places I really like to walk down to is the Riverside. It’s changed a lot over the years but it’s a fairly pretty place now with some nice views and although there’s not a lot there, it’s quite a nice place for a walk or to go to eat. So once I dropped the little ones off, I went.down to the Riverside.I start from Fatfield Bridge looking towards Penshaw Monument. That's the view in the first picture at the top, You can just see the Monument, way off in the distance. My husband says when he's travelling and sees the Monument he knows he's home. Funny that because he was born in Northumberland, but he thinks Washington is home now we've lived here so long.There's a street running along the north side of the river I have always liked. Wouldn't mind living there apart from the worry of flooding. My worry really, I don't think there have been any floods since we've lived in Washington, that's 38 years now.  I was just thinking about that when I noticed this Environmental Agency River Recorder box. Now I've walked down that street a few times but I've never noticed it before. Nice to know they're keeping an eye on things. Wonder if it's automatic or whether someone has to come out to measure it on the board. Maybe one of the residents does it. Along the street outside one house, there's a nice little touch even though it's not real. It's an imitation George V1 postbox. Shame it's a modern house though. Turning back and looking up the river the view is just as pretty, such a clear sunny day. To be honest it's much better than most of the summer days we had. Wonder how many of these we'll have left.As you walk along the bank you pass the first pub, the Biddick. Not as nice as in spring when the place is full of cherry blossom, but still a pretty picture. The last roses of summer are showing their faces too on the riverbank. Next there's the little war memorial. One of the smallest but nicest I've seen. Soon be covered in poppy wreaths.Just next to it is a lovely little sunny seat, but it's empty today. Next is the Italian restaurant and bar. Had a few nice meals in the restaurant as it's very child friendly and reasonably priced. Note the parasols and patio heaters, rain and cold doesn't stop the party! Also needed by the smokers now in the smoke free pubs and restaurants. I hadn't noticed before but there's a plaque on the wall above the fascia which you can hardly read as they painted over it. Apparently this building was the Fatfield Branch of the Chester- le-street Co-operative/Industrial Society in 1909. Glad they left a few of the old buildings. Amazing what you see when you stand and stare instead of just walking by as I usually do. Felt like a tourist! Just opposite on the south side is another street overlooking the river. Hard to believe that this whole area was a thriving village. Now it's just a couple of streets and a few pubs. All to make way for the Sir James Steele Park when the New Town was developed.Next is the Havelock, another watering hole on sunny days. Mmm it's certainly a pink pub. It gets quite lively here at night and on fine sunny summer days. About as rare as a £5 note in a bank!Well, I've enjoyed the walk, now it's time to go home and face the midden that's posing as my home!Come on now, please tell me. There must be somebody else out there who looks at Hugh Laurie as he's barracking his medical colleagues and says the immortal words of John McEnroe:“You can’t be serious man!” How on earth did they think we could take him seriously? Well maybe they thought because it was set in America and he had a different accent we wouldn’t recognise him. Not a chance! Could you ever forget seeing him prancing about as mad King George in Blackadder the Third? Not a cat in hell’s chance! King George . Or what about the simpleton Lieutenant George’s drag act in Blackadder Goes Forth? Lieutenant George Well, maybe they thought we had short memories. Think again. Then there was the slapstick and musical parodies in A Bit of Fry and Laurie They were just brilliant.My favourite was Jeeves and Wooster where he played Bertie Wooster “the witless socialite”. Sheer bliss. Jeeves and Wooster Now Stephen Fry's another story. Whilst his characters have been just as hilarious and anarchic somehow the character choices he’s made since then have been more believable. Take Kingdom for example. He’s absolutely believable as the lawyer whose good nature is sorely tried by his siblings and work colleagues. No problem. Kingdom So what’s the problem with House then? Well I don’t think it’s Hugh Laurie to blame, well not really. Maybe I just can’t believe in the character. Yes, that’s the problem! House just isn't real. Never mind he got a £2 million Los Angeles mansion out of it so no problems there. I haven't used any of the photos from the BBC or ITV's websites. I wouldn't dare, they're hot on copyright!so if you want to see for yourself I've put in the links BBC Comedy ITV Comedy Classics To end with, if anyone remembers the Blackadder TV series each episode ended with a song, every episode had different lyrics. The words to one episode in series 2 seem very apt at the moment with the financial crisis some banks have led us into. They’re a little bit naughty but…..“Take heed the moral of this tale,Be not a borrower or lender,And if your finances do fail,Make sure your banker's not a bender.Blackadder, Blackadder,He trusted in the Church,Blackadder, Blackadder,It left him in the lurch.Blackadder, Blackadder,His life was almost done.Blackadder, Blackadder,Who gives a toss? No-one!”"},
{"title": "Think I Need a Good Laugh!", "date": "Friday 3 October 2008", "text": "I've been counting how long it is to our summer holidays. Saddo aren't I. It's just we've had no summer this year and gone straight to what feels like winter not autumn.I need a good laugh and there hasn't been any good comedy on TV recently so I think it's time I read the David Niven autobiographies again. Each time I read them I laugh for ages at the antics he and his friends got up to. He was such a good writer.Another author who makes me laugh is Bill Bryson. Well let's face it, he's got to have a good sense of humour hasn't he, he's chosen to live in England poor soul! They made him Chancellor of Durham University in 2005. Wonder if it was because he was so nice about Durham in Notes From a Small Island?I remember reading one of his books in Malta's airport when we were standing in a massive long queue waiting to go through passport control. They officials seemed to have taken a very long coffee break. I was trying to keep my laugh in but eventually I started laughing out loud. It's always embarrassing when you do that, you feel such a loony. A German woman further up the queue smiled at me and gave me the thumbs up. Probably wished she had my book.I have a friend who puts a long letter in with my Christmas card each year and when I read it I start laughing. She's brilliant, all she does it update us on their activities, nothing weird or outlandish, it's just her take on life. It's hilarious. The last one was about how they have bought a caravan to tow and her husband's obsession with buying an awning. She didn't want one as she's seen too many \"awning antics\" on their travels. Needless to say he got his way and the letter was full of the perils of awnings. I would never have believed anyone could write so humorously about this. She can literally write about anything and make you laugh.I keep telling her she should write a book but she says she hasn't got time.We met as mature students doing a degree at Sunderland in the 'eighties and she was great fun. We went on a field trip to what was then Yugoslavia in the Polytechnic's bus. Yes a bus, and we laughed all the way across Holland, Germany, Austria and into Yugoslavia. Our faces and stomachs ached from laughing all day and into the night. I think the young students thought they were travelling with a bunch of escapees from a lunatic asylum. We meet up on occasions and we always talk about the daft things that happened on that trip.On the way across Germany we stayed at a strange hotel. Quite an ugly sixties concrete type of thing. The World Cup was on and I got fed up with watching it so I went to bed and missed all the fun. My friend stayed up chatting to some of the students at the bar. She had drunk quite a bit and was being chatted up by one of the male students on one side and on the other side of her was what she thought was a woman wearing a lot of make up. Suffice to say it was the \"woman\" who was eventually doing the chatting up and other things which I won't go into here. However my friend says due to the alcoholic haze she took ages to cotton on to it. The evils of drink!My friend is convinced we were staying in a house of ill repute and it was full of transvestites and prostitutes. I have to say the women did look a very rough bunch the next morning at breakfast, I hadn't noticed that the night before.Another time they decided to take us to view the fjord where The Vikings was filmed. Well it was supposed to be a geography trip after all. All went well until the driver, a German ex prisoner of war who never returned to Germany after the war (and that's another story), navigated the bus down a narrow road. He drove us into a campsite, a nudist campsite and couldn't reverse back out of it! The lecturers were shouting at the students and telling them not to laugh but it was hard not to. The funniest thing I saw was three nude men walking along carrying a canoe over their heads. I totally lost it at that point. We never got to see the fjord either!I keep telling her we ought to get together and write a book about all these things before we forget them altogether.I feel better already just thinking about that trip! Need to ring her to meet up soon for another laugh."},
{"title": "Eat Your Heart Out Apple, I'm a Windows Media Fan!", "date": "Thursday 2 October 2008", "text": "Now this is a bit of a saga. So in true Watch with Mother style, \"Are you sitting comfortably? Then I'll begin.\"The time had finally arrived for me to buy an MP3 thingy to listen to music and other stuff. I had got sick of carting about a compact CD player and multiple CDs, especially on holiday. Last time I used it on holiday it was a pain to have to get up of the sun lounger to take out the CD, put it away and faff about looking for Disk 5 of Michel Thomas’ Larn Yersel’ Spanish.Now I'd heard all the hype about Apple's great design skills and how they beat the pants off Microsoft stuff. I did a bit of research on various “thingies” and I listened to my daughter and some friends waxing lyrical about the merits of iPods. So off I went to the shops just before the family holiday in May, intent on getting one to reduce the amount of luggage I had to carry. This would be “numero uno” in the MP3 thingy justification stakes to improve my Spanish while I relaxed by a quiet pool in Rhodes.Had a look at a few and have to say the iPod did look the business, neat and a nice choice of colours. So after about 5 people in the shop had asked me if I needed any help, I finally said yes to one. The chappie recommended the iPod, it had excellent sound reproduction, was very popular, (which I knew already) and very “intuitive”. Well the warning bells should have gone off straight away then. Intuitive my ****. If anyone ever says that again I might just deck them. Foolish person that I am listened and finally decided on a mid price iPod in a nice shade of blue (I don’t do Barbie pink, yuk!). After all I still had to justify the purchase to my husband Eric, so I didn’t go berserk! Took the little thingy home and opened it up. What a tiny thing to get for such a big price! The only cost comparison I can make is with my diamond engagement ring and that was forty years ago! Never mind I was going to have a great time listening to all those CDs that had been languishing upstairs for years. Wasn't I? Justification, numero dos! Next surprise, no instructions. In fact no nothing, just the little \"thingy\", a usb cable and a little pair of ear plug things. Now I have to admit I’m an instruction manual person. Not for me diving in to assemble an Ikea chest of drawers, producing a wonky bookcase, being left with 5 spare parts, then going back to read the instructions and starting again. I always read the instructions. It’s a woman thing I’m sure. Must just plug it in to the lap top and it’ll play I thought. Well that’s what you do with a lot of stuff like digital cameras and flash keys. Microsoft stuff! So did that & what came up? A folder full of empty Real Player files. Now here’s where I should have heard those flipping warning bells again. This is where I made a BIG mistake, I should have gone to the Apple site and tried to find out a bit more. However as Real Player had popped up I wrongly assumed that’s what I had to use. Must be something to do with the way the lap top is set up.Here’s where it started to get really painful. I realised that all my CDs were installed on Windows Media Player. Now I know lots of people don’t like Windows stuff, well that’s up to them. I for one absolutely love Windows Media Player and won’t have a word said against it, it’s so colourful and easy to use.I realised the files wouldn’t be compatible with the iPod but couldn’t be bothered to go down the file conversion route. Had enough of that with my phone. Now in retrospect, that’s why Real Player probably came up on the lap top. Funny how it all comes back to you when it’s too late!So off I went loading my CDs again for a few hours. Well I didn't have anything better to do did I? Only packing to go away in 2 days! They all showed up great in iTunes on the lap top and I transferred them over to the iPod without a hitch. Brilliant I thought, let’s get cracking. Only one problem, no music showing up on the iPod. Time to give up and sleep on it I thought, come back to it in the morning. Big problem. How do I switch the rotten little thing off? There are no instructions and it isn't obvious. No off switch. Have to ring my son in law to find out.Morning came, took all the files off and put them back again. Still no luck and the iPod showed over a gigabyte of space used up, so the files were there, somewhere. Now it was time to go to the Apple site and do what I should have done immediately. Find some online instructions!Have to say there was a really good video on how to set up your iPod so I watched that. After that, I knew that iTunes apparently should have “popped up” as soon as I connected the iPod to my computer. It didn't though and there was no information on what to do if it doesn’t! Still at least I knew I should be using iTunes and not Real Player. So I had to register with iTunes and guess what? Give my credit card details before I could download it, what a bloomin' pain!Next I had to reset the iPod back to its original state. The instructions were good on how to do that, thank goodness.Reloaded all the files again (hours of this) but again I couldn’t face file conversions. Great! So now I have all the files showing up on the lap top and I have to transfer them (which was a doddle on Real Player). Not so with this, nothing happened when I tried it.So now it’s time to go through the diagnostics tests. Get through all of these apart from the last one which says there is a problem, the iPod isn’t “syncing” with the lap top or vice versa. Gives you a great file to save and print out to give to “someone who might be helping you with this”. I ask you! We don't all have an ICT technician lurking in the cupboard. I thought that diagnostic tests would also help you sort out the problem. Well pardon me but Windows does this, so why can’t Apple?So I go back to the installation video again. I watch it noticing that you have to manually “sync” with iTunes. Problem sorted!Now I always believe in feeding back to the company, after all they're not psychic and don't know I hate their stuff with a vengeance do they? Well they do now.Just a few suggestions about this experience for Mr/Mrs Apple (whoever they are) which I sent them.1. Get your act together and put a note on the tiny bit of paper in the iPod box to say what should happen when you plug in.2. Give a url to go to in case it doesn’t start up correctly. Not everyone has bought an iPod before and it certainly isn’t intuitive to me.3. Do something about the diagnostics tests and help people to sort out their problems.4. Do something about iTunes! It's RUBBISH! Looks out of the ark. Take a look at Windows Media Player.5. Do something about the registration process. Why should I have to go through this horrendous registration when all I want is to set up an iPod? Maybe I’m unusual but I don’t want to buy music at the moment. Take my card details when I do.6. Art work! The process isn’t automatic the way Media Player is. Also why can’t it pick up the correct artwork? I’ve selected the correct version of the CD so why can't it find the correct art work. Hate to say it again but Media Player does this no problem.ConclusionNot surprisingly, I wasn't very happy with the iPod. Hopefully that would changeI decided to continue to use Windows Media Player on my lap top, it’s a much simpler process and a better experience. Problem is now I would have to buy a separate hard drive to store the duplicate music!Well that was in May this year. Now how do I feel? No better!The whole experience put me off using the iPod. On holiday I hardly used it but my husband really liked it. Well he hadn't had the trauma had he!I haven't uploaded any more music until today when I found some CDs I really like.Give it a go, you've had time to get over the grief I thought. Well I got some more today.Today the iTunes background screen turned purple for some unknown reason and I could hardly read the text to upload the music.I hate iTunes with a real passion!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! If I ever buy another MP3 thingy it won't be an iPod.Rant over."},
{"title": "Another Rainy Day in Washington", "date": "Tuesday 30 September 2008", "text": "The rain is back again! That Indian Summer was short lived. Where on earth did that saying come from? Just looked it up on Wikipedia, as you do and looks like it came from the USA and means Native American rather than the Indian subcontinent. The PC police don't seem to have got their eyes on that saying. Yet!Oscar, my long haired moggy of 19 years has just proved cats are just as unwilling to accept their age as I am. Thought it was just me who couldn't accept the aging process and that it's fifty years since I visited and fell in love with Barcelona, screamed at a Beatles concert, Dr Who appeared on our TV screens and John Kennedy was assassinated. Oh heck I'm ancient, it's official!I heard an unearthly wailing in the garden. Had to be a cat so I checked. Yes, nineteen year old Oscar howling at a beautiful ginger and white moggy at the bottom of the garden. He was visible proof of the spirit being willing but the flesh weak as he stood there howling at this much bigger and younger cat. So as you do, I provided some much needed moral support and walked down the garden towards them. Once he knew the backup had arrived, Oscar sprang into action and chased the alien cat up the fence. Oscar sprang to the top in pursuit but at that point his aging back legs betrayed him, he lost his balance and promptly fell over the fence. True to his male species he nonchalantly got up, shook himself and then chased the other cat into the wood. Wish I'd had my camera. He appeared ten minutes later at the front door, came in, sat on the settee and is fast asleep beside me now, obviously all in the dim and distant past.Wish I was a cat. Well one with a good home where I'd be fed and watered to my hearts content, with a nice chair to lie on during the day and a warm bed to spend the night on.Was hoping I'd get out into the garden again this afternoon but the rain put paid to that idea. So I just sat back, enjoyed Diagnosis Murder for a while and cuddled Lauren. Much better than gardening! Let's see what tomorrow brings."},
{"title": "Stop Procrastinating and Just Do It!", "date": "Saturday 27 September 2008", "text": "I'm probably the world's greatest procrastinator.I'm not joking! Really it's dithering, procrastination is just a posh word for it. Well, I've dithered about for ages thinking about writing a blog and wondering what to write about and then again whether to write one at all. It's been 18 months since I first thought about it when I left my job working for the Connexions Service in County Durham.It seemed like a good idea to keep a record of my new lifestyle and the things I would do once I had more time on my hands. Ha! Ha! However I took some time to think about it. You see? Procrastination at work again. Anyway, I started to think about what I've done over the last 18 months. After all I'd had such great ideas, hadn't I?I'd enjoy more time with my grandchildren, especially Lauren who's 3.I'd get the house tidied up and decorated as it's been sorely neglected while I've been working. To be truthful it's a tip as I'm such a hoarder and untidy with it. My daughter groans at the thought of clearing it all out when I kick the bucket. I have no doubt that everything will go into a huge skip or two (maybe more).Then there's the garden, also a bit of a tip. Again I've dithered about it for years. Watched loads of TV programmes, read books and drawn up plans and.....nothing. Eat your heart out Alan Titchmarsh!My community website for Washington AboutMyArea NE38 needed some work doing on it. I'd spent ages getting the information on it but it needed more time spent on marketing it.My Spanish language skills also needed improving. I've been going to classes for years but never really concentrated on it. Not enough time, I said to myself. When I retired I'd go and live in Spain for a couple of months. Immerse myself in the language, it's the only way.Then there were lots of small projects I'd started and never finished. The cross stitch panels, a half finished jumper, a crochet cloth and so on.So 18 months on what have I achieved? Well, if I'm honest, not a lot!However, I'm still here and I'm happy. I suppose they're my greatest achievements!The house has had a couple of rooms \"tarted up\" but it's not looking a lot better thanks to my hobbies and untidy habits. I've watched quite few programmes on doing up houses but have to say I didn't really take to any of their ideas. The minimalist look isn't my thing. Too 'sixties for me and I've already been there. I'd give the TV House Doctor a thump. Give me \"homely\" any day.My Spanish hasn't improved at all. Probably got worse! Haven't been able to go to Spain for a couple of months due to \"grandchild responsibilities\". I don't know why I haven't got into the habit of just switching on a \"Larn Yersel\" Spanish CD to listen to (on the rare occasions I force myself to do some housework) or maybe picking up the books which have been lying about and adding to the mess. I can only assume I don't really want to. Strange!The garden? Well the garden fairies haven't visited sadly. It hasn't been touched apart from occasionally having the lawn cut, thanks to two of the worst summers I can remember for donkeys years. At present it's like a quagmire due to the clay soil. I've really been enjoying myself with my grandchildren, Nathan & Lauren. I've often wondered whether I've enjoyed them more than I enjoyed my children. It's probably my memory playing me false but there's not so much to worry about and much more time for fun. Things like trampolining, face painting and generally jumping and dancing about like a loony.I love reading but I normally reserve it for holidays because once I pick a book up, I find it hard to put it down until I finish it. However I've read a few books recently. Alan Alda's autobiography, \"Never Have Your Dog Stuffed\" was a great read. He seems just as nice in real life as he did on M.A.S.H. and he's not a womaniser. Must get his latest book \"Things I Overheard While Talking to Myself\". I enjoyed one of Colin Dexter's Inspector Morse stories, I just had to remember to keep a dictionary close by. I thought I had a reasonable command of the English language but occasionally I came across a word I didn't know or couldn't remember like \"otiose\". That's the only word I can remember looking up! One book I re-read was an Ellis Peters Cadfael story. I love the TV series with Derek Jacobi; another daytime TV treasure I re-visited on rainy days this summer. Well there were plenty of them, rainy days I mean. Decided I'm going to continue reading but I'm going back to using the public library as our bookshelves are all full and I don't want any more books lying about. It's very green and saves cash too!As I mentioned earlier, due to the bad weather this summer, I've discovered I like \"some\" of the daytime TV programmes. Not really a good idea to get too hooked on this as it stops you getting things done. Although I have to say it's been great to revisit Inspector Morse, Cadfael and Poirot. Mind you, one series I'd love to see again is M.A.S.H. I don't think they have ever shown it in the UK since the original screening way back. It's a classic and would have a whole new audience of younger viewers who have never had the chance to see it. Would probably top the ratings too; but then I'd never get any work done.I've finished a couple of sewing projects I started earlier and still progressing with a few others. I've spent hours on the Internet. Far too much time but I've enjoyed it. Time to focus on more tangible productive things now.So what now?Well I'm going to take up my patchwork & quilting again. Found lots of information on the Internet about groups in USA, Australia and down south. Don't seem to be many groups here in the North East which is a pity but I'm still looking. On the off chance that anyone reads this blog and has some information about a group near to Washington, Tyne and Wear, please get in touch via my website page.I've been looking for a holiday in Spain for a week to try to motivate me to start my Spanish again. Also been looking for some Spanish classes at the local college with no success. This seems ironic given the constant criticism about the UK having such poor language skills and how young people are losing out in the international job market due to this. The colleges seem to be focusing on basic skills. That's no bad thing, but I don't understand why so many people have poor basic skills when so much has been spent on education over the years. I came from a poor mining town and can't remember anybody in my class not being able to read. Gripe over!Task achieved! I've finally written a Blogg and the weather's great for once, so I'm off to do some gardening.Now, stop the dithering, just press the button and publish!"}
