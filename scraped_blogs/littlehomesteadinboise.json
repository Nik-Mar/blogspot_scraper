{"title": "Big Snow!!! Queen's Cake Baking ", "date": "Jan 14, 2024", "text": "Big Snow!!!-Well we got the big snow that was predicted! I was watching the weather really closely Friday because we knew it was coming, but wasn't sure exactly about the timing. I follow a local young meteorologist on Facebook (Treasure Valley Weather Headquarters Kody) who is much more on track than the TV weather guys and he really nailed it right down to the hour or so. No snow Friday night on the way home which was really nice, forecast from NWS-   We ran some errands Saturday morning (yesterday) and got home, the snow started in the afternoon. It really picked up after about 4:00 p.m. and then we really got hammered. The high for the day was 17°! I kept the heat lamp on in the coop overnight. I do turn it off during the day even though it's hard wired in. I'm always a little paranoid about a fire. Had about a good five or six inches on the ground when I went to bed, woke up to about 4 or 5 more inches! The top photo of our herb boxes, the solar light are buried completely. There's a video of the snow on my Instagram account, just click on the link! Looks lovely but Dave definitely had a lot to dig out. He shoveled the front sidewalk or driveway and the neighbor sidewalk as well. Lows of 6 degrees tonight, 2 degrees tomorrow night! More snow later in the week. Love our little tree! He created a little walkway for me to get to the coop and he cleared off the sunroom. This is the reason why we always put this up!    Gives the chickens a lot more dry space when the weather is bad. I've been going out every day and giving them some greens and some wild bird food to give them something to peck at and keep them busy. Deck-Solar bulbs still showing last night   Queen's Cake Baking-Since I had tomorrow off as a holiday I decided to do some baking this weekend. Since I was still recovering a bit for my surgery I didn't really do any traditional Christmas/holiday baking. I love the recipe for the Williamsburg Queens Cake. I've made it quite a few times before. It has lemon and orange extract with Currants. It takes about an hour and a half to bake but it's worth the wait! You want to let it cool completely before you slice into it and it's even better the next day. Keeps really well! Today or tomorrow I'll be making some chocolate chip oatmeal cookies with bittersweet chocolate chips. I did make the cake yesterday with half whole wheat pastry flour to make it a little bit healthier and I'll do the same with the cookies. When it's 17 degrees out it's a good time to bake!"},
{"title": "More Snow & The New Year, Recovery, My DNA Results!", "date": "Jan 9, 2024", "text": "More Snow & The New Year-***Update! We got over 5\" yesterday, a near record!*** If you followed this blog at all you know I love snow! Living in the high desert we don't always get very much, but it varies year to year. We had a couple of small snowfalls  maybe an inch, but it melted. Then we got into some record high temp weather in December where it was almost 47°! Last week we finally had a good snow of 2 inches. Really beautiful! I had intentionally left a few holiday decor items on the deck so that it might look nice if it snowed and we got lucky, the bulbs are solar lights- We got another 2 inches this last weekend which stayed due to the cold weather. We did get another inch overnight last night, it warmed up and some of it did melt. That mountains are really getting hammered which is good for the snow pack, tourists and the ski season. More on the way if you check the map. This is definitely winter winter winter. I've been putting extra food out for the chickens, some snacks and things since they don't go outside much to keep them occupied. More snow expected the next several days, first \"BLIZZARD\" warning in years -  I am loving it! The city's been staying on top of the roads pretty well so not too bad going to work. Loved doing Christmas/winter/Yule decorating my \"buffet\" I created last year-   My favorite new purchase was this little tree, it lights up. I put in in my big Ikea crock and looks perfect!My Trader Joe's bulb garden has done amazing (as usual)! We spent Christmas morning with our family and had a quiet New Year's. Happy New Year to all! PLEASE LET ME KNOW IF THIS BLOG FONT IS TOO BIG? THANKS!Recovery- I didn't know what exactly to do a photo of so I decided to add this since the Acupuncture has been so helpful! I have been back in the office for about a week, all going well. Since most insurances don't cover acupuncture much at all (if any)  I'm very fortunate that Boise has an Acupuncture Co-op! Kind of a sliding fee scale kind of thing once established as a patient. The acupuncturist I work with is really awesome I must say. I've been seeing her every two weeks and I noticed it really helped with the inflammation and healing. I also worked with my long-term Chiropractor as she did some really really minute adjustments (not on the surgical site)  but around it. My low back, separate from where the surgery was done, took a beating with being in bed so much and not moving around. After the first adjustment I walked out and I was actually upright completely with little pain. All in all everything is going super well, only been eight weeks and I'm about 98% recovered! Pain-free and all of the tingling in my legs is pretty much gone except on rare occasions. Very perfect outcome with lots of prayers involved. Great way to start the new year! My DNA Results!Dave did a great job, for my December birthday/combo Christmas present- a DNA test from Ancestry. I had already done our family trees there. It was funny I always had loved Scandinavian culture and it turns out I'm part Scandinavian! And much more so than I ever would have guessed. Turns out my mother was 25% Scandinavian, as well as a large portion of Northern British, much of which apparently was settled by the Vikings. I was sort of aware of this migration, but not much. Anyway it's been really exciting to see. I guess there's a reason I've always gravitated toward Scandinavian culture, etc. Since I was a very young child when I first read about the Laplanders now known as the Sami (I think) I was fascinated by the Far North. I already knew about the Austrian/Czech side but never heard any family member mention any Swedish/Danish/Norwegian!  More DNA details here, interesting and a few potential family members popped up, probably won't contact, time will tell-"},

{"title": "Gratitude, Winter Is Here/Food Preps", "date": "Nov 27, 2023", "text": "Gratitude -I was going to do a \"what I'm thankful for\" post but didn't have time to get that done before Thanksgiving. So, while belated, here are some things I am EXTREMELY grateful for:Surgery: One of the things I'm most grateful for right now is coming through some back surgery, solved a lot of chronic pain issues for the last year. I had two options, got two different opinions. The first doctor barely looked at Dave and I, rattled off a lot of statistics. Not a good fit. Second doctor, at a totally different practice, looked at us, answered Dave and my questions, outlined everything really well. Chose that procedure. Much shorter recovery time, surgery went well, I had immediate pain relief about 90% plus. I'm getting better each day! I've been off work the last two weeks, one more week off work then next week will start working half-time at home. Will gradually increase my hours till the end of the year and then back in the office in January. I am very grateful that I was already set up to work from home! My boss and my co-worker have been really supportive.  Dave's such an incredible hard worker, and went above and beyond caring for me the 1st week after surgery. We had our 30th anniversary in this time frame! We were able to go out to dinner and relax.New Tires: Dave took my Mazda in for a oil change and turned out the tires were really low, which was kind of a shock to us. We had about 20,000 miles onto 70,000 mile tires. Dave talked to them and since that was the place we bought the tires from they gave us a big credit towards new tires. They said they had problems with this make and model. We got brand new tires this weekend, huge discount. We also got a different brand so hopefully we won't go through this again. It was good timing getting the replaced going into WINTER since we're just starting to get some snow in the area. Nothing at our house yet, buT due this week!Dave's Pal: Dave was thrilled that a longtime childhood friend Bob moved to our area. I had met him before, great guy. I am really happy they can spend some time together and hang out. We had him over for a simple Thanksgiving dinner, since he moved here three days before and didn't know anyone in the area. It was lovely! Really enjoyed my newer \"buffet\", after removing the computer in the kitchen last year, worked great for serving turkey day foods! Sorry no food shots-Roasted some leftover pumpkins from the house for the girls-  Still wondering what they are?    Winter Is Here/Food Preps-The cold weather has finally come! We had 18° weather last week, with our first snow forecast down in the valley for late this week. This is a time of year I stock up on certain things. We did take down all of the Autumn/Thanksgiving decor this weekend. I don't have any Advent/Christmas stuff up quite yet. I like to take a breather between the two. I did put my first holiday decor up, my favorite vintage jar with a little red berries on the kitchen window. We did make a run to Trader Joe's and I bought one of their nice small fresh candle wreaths that I actually hang on the kitchen wall. Bought some live red berries, some evergreen branches, an amaryllis and a few food items. Before surgery I totally forgot to buy some amaryllis bulbs last month. We went to Costco a while back and I needed some unbleached flour. I do try to do as much whole grain and I have tons of whole wheat/whole wheat pastry flour. At Costco they had a large bag of all purpose flour for eight bucks, much cheaper than at the grocery store so I bought a bag. I think it was 15 lb? I bought some wheat berries from the LDS Food Store online.  Churchofjesuschrist.org/Food Storage Basically you can set up a new account if you are not a member, which I am not, and when you set up your profile there's a checkbox where you CHECK \"I am not a member\".  I got a really great deal on six cans of hard wheat berries for about $45. I think shipping was about $7? Took about 2 weeks but I'm really happy to have the wheat berries on hand. I think next year is going to be really really ugly for the wheat market in the US for the consumer. Really great thing is berries keep a long time in a cool, dry area in those cans. They do also sell other dehydrated things like carrots, potatoes, onions, beans, oats. I thought they had a really good customer service with shipping in a fairly timely manner. Also went thru my pantry, got out some of my stash of coffee beans. Bought more teas, cereals. Washed and sorted our winter hats and gloves. Using those already!  Here's a peek at our garden-random gorgeous fall colors here at our homestead- Our Oak Leaf Hydrangea  Backyard mound garden Dave got the sun room up on the coop two weeks ago-  Bonnie enjoying the winter sun-   I had some scrap faux Ikea sheepskin (cut out a circle for Bonnie's kitty perch top)-   I thought I could winterize my little bench!   Just cut a curve and draped!"},

{"title": "Harvest Time! September is National Preparedness Month, Warranty Success With A Twist", "date": "Sep 23, 2023", "text": "Harvest Time! It's been busy, busy busy!!! Harvest time is always great (and) way too much at once. Our Redhaven peach tree was delayed this year because of our wacky late spring early summer weather and started ripening around the same time as the pears. Usually our Red Haven peaches are ripe in July well ahead of the other fruit trees. We froze, baked and canned some, gave some to my kiddos. Froze these on a cookie sheet, then vacuum sealed in bags for later- Apples are done now, gave away some to both my daughters and their in-laws. I put canning on hold this year as I just don't have the time and some medical stuff going on. Also working a lot of overtime at work. Since we have quite a bit left over from the last two years we're good. We have lots of fresh apples stashed in both of our refrigerators which will last for months. They are delish! As a twist we have pretty much decided to actually cut down our apple tree. It is way too big and is producing way too much fruit for us. It was a tough decision in some ways but the right thing to do. Dave has a friend who's going to take the tree down for the firewood and in the spring we'll find a nice dwarf apple tree to put in its place. I canned peaches, pears got to ripe too fast with the heat so I didn't can any. Did baking and we are ate lots fresh! Pear crisp- Tomatoes are coming in like crazy, finally! Our favorite variety this summer is the Black Prince tomato, a Russian variety, sweet and really delicate flavor! Smaller but amazing, will plant again- Lots and lots on the vine too. I frozen some, have eaten fresh and used some of our bumper of crop cherry tomatoes to roast and pack in olive oil. They will keep well in the fridge through the winter. Elliott Homestead has some really good videos on Youtube for food prepping. I used her recipe for the cherry tomatoes. She has another recipe for sun-dried tomatoes (in the oven) and again packed in olive oil. I made those too-  Roasting  Freezing, used vacuum bags after this part  Roma's \"sun dried\" in the oven  Packed in Olive oil   In the fridge for winter  Fresh with our Basil and cukes!  Swiss chard grew really well in a in a box this summer! The chickens love it so I give them some as treats- Kind of so-so on our new little garden bed with radishes, carrots, and green onions. I think it's just been the weather since they've been getting plenty of water-  I bought really fresh, nice pickling cucumbers at a local farmstead to ferment again this year. One jar went to each of my daughters and the rest for me- Made my 1st Chimichurri, came out great with my stored frozen roast and local roasted potatoes!    Eggs are in good production since Luna started laying again!    We're ready for Autumn!   Bonnie enjoying the ending summer light-     September is National Preparedness Month-Speaking of storing and preserving food! September is National Preparedness Month (again). I can't say strongly enough I think things are going to get much much worse over the next few years before they get better. If you or your loved ones, or someone you know, is the type to thank everything will be okay they will be in for a very rude awakening. I HOPE I AM WRONG. I'm not trying to be negative, just realistic, and for those who are able to listen- store up extra foods, water, cash, fuel you know the drill. You can look back on my preparedness posts here or Google September National Preparedness Month for all kinds of resources in your area. Don't forget your pets and don't forget over the counter supplements, syrups, pain relief, etc. What if you had a bad cough and couldn't find cough syrup anywhere? Not a good scenario, but if you have a couple of extra bottle stashed along with other kinds of first aid supplies your set. Winter is coming and we've already seen the bizarre international weather events. This is the new normal. Just a good reminder to not rely on anybody to help you, EVER.  Warranty Success With A Twist-I blogged a while back about how I found a used Stanley travel mug with (it turned out) a broken lid-  I replaced the lid which wound up leaking sadly. I called the Stanley customer service number which was an overseas call center. That was pretty well a nightmare. I looked on their website and anything over 30 days was NOT covered by warranty, shocked! I had bought the lid and stored it for quite a few months before I used it. I started thinking about a work-around. I went on to Amazon's website looked up the Stanley flask/mug that was similar and posted a question, since I couldn't post a comment. Mentioned that they had terrible customer service and was there a local phone number? Within 24 hours I got an email from Stanley to go to their website and fill out a form, which I did. I got a response within about 2 days asking for a photo of the bottom of the cup and a video showing the leak, which I did. Within a few days I was told that the lid is out of stock, but that they were going to send me a replacement. Not a replacement LID, which was what I asked for, but a full replacement mug/flask. They let me choose which of two colors, I went with Rose Quartz (almost Copper), so now I have a brand new Stanley travel mug/flask and lid that works! Item here- Stanley1913 Mug I will save the old one, just won't use in a bag, etc. Pretty funny, I spent $3.00 for the thrifted item, $10 for a new lid and I wound up getting a free, more expensive new flask. Always pays to be creative and think about your options."},

{"title": "100 + Degree Heat and Independence Days Challenge", "date": "Jul 25, 2023", "text": "100 Degree Heat and Independence Days Challenge- Like other parts of the country it's been very very hot here lately! It was 106 or 107 last week. At this point we're just trying to keep our garden/yard and our chickens alive. We're very lucky that we have excellent air conditioning and a very low water bill compared to other parts of Boise in the surrounding area. We're part of a very small water district and so no matter how much water we use the bill is the same. Having said that we do try to remind ourselves that we need to mulch as much as possible as we live in a high desert. Some people just worry about their bill and not how much is in the water table. Luckily we did have a wet spring so hopefully it's not as bad as usual. Hoping for some relief on the way! Some summer decor is up, nice and cheery- Beach table Our lovely daughter Tami gifted us with a gorgeous crystal paper weight from her recent Oregon Coast vacation, Moon Jellyfish- Gorgeous!  Here's what we've been up to here at the Little Homestead...Independence Days Challenge1. Plant Something-Too hot this time of year just keeping things alive. Garden is looking good though!  2. Harvest Something-About one egg a day. New veggies coming along- Radishes, a few carrots and green onions from seed, added new soil  Swiss Chard and herbs-Been getting a good amount of cucumbers,  mostly lemon. Starting to get some decent sized green cucumbers for slicing. It's been too hot for the tomatoes to set fruit, but there are a few small tomatoes. Peppers are coming along as well, no squash yet. One of our chickens Luna has not been laying for about the last month. Really odd to only be getting about one egg per day. Debbie still looks slower, but is hanging in there. The vet I took her to months ago said she had a mass and had a lot of edema. She seems to be holding her own! I'm surprised she's lasted this long. I definitely don't want to lose two chickens! Luna looks pretty healthy and seems okay otherwise so I increased her, and the flock's, protein content by getting them some dried meal worm mixed treats. They love them! Hopefully egg production will start up again. This is why I dehydrated lots of eggs last year when we have a over abundant supply. We use a mister in their shade area to keep them cooler, cheap and effective, also water down their run daily and cool treats like cuke slices-3. Preserve/Store Something-As always with food prices been watching for good deals. Found some really good deals at Trader Joe's recently. One of my favorite quick fast/work dinners is Trader Joe's non-cured pepperoni pizza. I top with whatever vegetables we have at home like olives, peppers, onions and then bake. It's a quick dinner for the two of us. Four good slices (for two of us) for $5.00.  Serve with some veggies or salad. Lots of apples, pears, and peaches on the trees will be doing lots of canning this year! I haven't made my chunky applesauce in a few years so will be making some this year-  Apples  Pears  Pollinators helping out-4. Manage Reserves- Get a Good Deal/Barter/Stock Up/Prep-Working off of our freezer, used a pork roast to make for pulled pork, etc. Went to the Grocery Outlet, got some great deals: organic cereals, canned chicken chili, baking mixes, fresh fruit and I even bought a Jade plant! For six bucks it was really healthy and will live a long time. Bought replacement pair of sneakers on Amazon for 30% off. I bought some used books/DVDs on eBay and a few other things for the house. Working on using it more of the freezer foods including some fruits and vegetables. Got some items at Costco- $8.00, for 2 dinners plus extras   Great for pasta, lasts a long time! 5. Eat the Food- Try New Foods/Recipe-Bought some Asian noodles and tofu at a local Asian store and made stir fry! Use lots of fresh ginger, Hoisin sauce and vegetables. On the noodles did Tamari sauce and sesame oil. Topped with sesame seeds, excellent! 6. Build Community Food Systems-Haven't made it out to the local farmstead place yet, a little bit early. It's also quite a lot of gas to drive out to Caldwell, so putting that on hold for now to keep our expenses down. No eggs to give away right now. 7. Recycle/Re-Use-Went through my clothes  and craft closet. Donated some decorative things for the house that I just don't really use anymore. Sold my old Peugeot bike for $175.00! Dave's old one is for sale too. We bought two newer used ones, much easier to ride. Went to Goodwill and found some great stuff recently! Bought some used music CD's on eBay as well as a couple of tops. We went to two different Goodwill stores and found some really great deals. I got mugs that match my earlier one (except gray) and a really fun French Chateau clock that I repaired. The top of had a hole. Got a fun snowy yard sign that's folk art looking for winter. Got some sidewalk chalk for the grand kids. Stopped at Hobby Lobby and got a nice welcome sign, summer clearance priced-  $3.00 for two  Goes with my previous thrifted blue ones!  Mini farm animals to go with thrifted toy barn, $1.00, grand kids love it!  Ripley putting the animals away! Cute thrifted clock, $6.00  Hole on the top  Used light weight spackle, took 3 times to fill  colored with a black magic marker, all done! works great!    Gravy boat with dish, $3.00      Beachy shadow box $3.00  Thrifted sign $3.00, about 12\" x 8\" Clearance from Hobby Lobby, $6.00 for front door Painted last month's thrifted Fleur de lis a flat cream, will distress soon, maybe. \"Before\"- \"After\"- Some of our bird houses were shot, so Dave got out some spare lumber and built some new ones-    The local birds love this size- New recycled roofs, bought at yard sales. Will paint with leftover house paint and decorate. More soon! 8. Skill Up-Still learning lots about my new-er job and doing well. Excellent benefits working for the Federal government! A bit of a bureaucracy however but that's the way it is.  9. Regenerate What is Lost/Salvage Something-We have our blue towels from Ikea that we really like. We went through the second time where the set of towels is in pretty good shape but the washcloths were getting really scratchy. Because we have really hard water and the washcloths are wet most of the time they get pretty icky and discolored after a while. Since I had a hand towel I had not used yet as part of the set I decided to make two washcloths. I basically measure them out against an existing washcloth hand them on the sewing machine and added a loop to one of them. Much softer and thicker! And didn't cost anything- Old washcloth as a pattern Sorry, already in use!I have been debating for years washing one, or both, of my Grandmother's Depression Era quilts. One was in much worse shape than the other so I decided to wash the better one first. The main problem with it is the edging was pretty well shot. We have a setting on our washer that's called Deep Water that basically fills the whole washer up. We rarely use this setting, but I decided to use it for the quilt. I read when washing really old quilts to wash them, then stretch them out on the grass in the sun to dry. You wouldn't want to do this right after you mowed however! So I washed it and dried it and wow what a difference, used warm water, mild soap and Clorox 2-    Bow Tie quiltI don't think I'd washed it in about 20 years or more, was afraid to. I started thinking about what grandma would think and she probably would think that I should watch the other one too! So I did. The one in better shape I think I'm going to go ahead and buy some binding for her and do the edges- The one that's more worn I may go ahead and try to buy some matching fabric for some of the squares that are pretty well beat up and replacing those. Time will tell but I'd like to preserve them as best as possible. All clean #2!"},

{"title": "Wild Weather/Front Yard Garden Redo, Thrifting Scores!", "date": "Jun 18, 2023", "text": "Wild Weather/Front Yard Re-Do:Life has been busy, so NO blogging lately! Settled in my new job nicely, took a lot of brain power I will say. We've had some very WILD weather since May, a lot of rain, some snow and wild temperature swings. We had some flooding on the street right near ours two weeks ago. The force of the water pushed the manhole covers up and off! We had some severe monsoon type rain. Then rain off and on mild temperatures. We had another monsoon rain last week. That resulted in the basement office (across the hall from where I work) having 4 inches of water on the floor. Luckily it triggered an alarm for cleanup and there was no permanent damage. Getting cool again with a freeze advisory in Oregon tonight. The rain's been great for the perennials!     It's been tough on everyone's allergies sadly. Pollen city. It has made it hard to do gardening trying to work between the weather systems. I've gone between wearing summer clothes and winter clothes. We had  some firefighters in the Boise National Interagency Fire Center going up to Canada to help with their fires. I feel really bad for them but I think this is going to become a regular thing sadly. Crazy weather, excessive rain and droughts. Before shotLast year the county came through, widened our street and added sidewalks which were much-needed. We knew it was coming, which was good, so we were able to plan ahead. Since we had a lot of shrubs and perennials right along the front sidewalk we were able to move some of them to the back yard. We figured we would save of those more mature plants. After the process was done the county had added a steep slope on the front with turf. We decided to let it winter over and then re-do in the spring. Dave was able to remove the first strip of turf closest to the sidewalk by hand. We both went shopping and picked out some things we liked. All drought resistant and low water.  I thought it would look nice to have something tall that would stay green year round in the corner by the sidewalk and driveway. I think it looks nice! It's  a Juniper-  We opted for some different kinds of plants with different colors and textures. We choose a nice tall grass by the end and then mixed in with some different perennials and shrubs. We relocated one of the shrubs from the backyard into the second section, but it died. Bought a replacement. The other one survived. Dave did all the planting, then put down weed barrier and bark-dusted. With a tight budget we're going to do the rest of it this fall and next spring so that the whole slope will be landscaped, no mowing.  I would like to remove all of the front yard turf but Dave is not a fan so far. Time will tell. Really happy all our fruit trees are really loaded this year! Love our peaches- Red Haven peaches With various projects and the weather we got kind of a slow start getting the vegetable garden planted. We went through this last year! Luckily I had started some things from seeds and we had planted some cucumbers, two different kinds, kale and collard greens. Those have done okay with the crazy weather. I also started from seed some rainbow Swiss chard and added a couple store-bought ones and started those in a wooden planter box. I also started some basil,  transplanted outside into another planter. We finally bought some veggies, Dave planted the various tomatoes, yellow squash, Italian and Gypsy Sweet peppers. They will be slow to get going, but worth the wait. Our normal summer are so hot they will grow thru most of October-  Thrifting Scores!I hit a local thrift store this week and got some really great deals! My non-stick 13\" skillet I use all the time was starting to fade. I spotted was a 12 inch like-new non-sick skillet. The lid I already had fits perfect, $4.00-  I found a Stanley coffee mug for $3.00-When I got home I realized part of the lid was missing that you push to drink. Luckily the Stanley website has replacement caps, so for $10.00 I ordered one, then will work. Still saved quite a bit on that one. It will be good in the winter to be able to take my own hot tea to work. We don't really have a break room in the part of the building I'm in. No where to get hot water.I've been meaning to make a \"bug hotel\" but then saw one for  $10.00. We mounted in our backyard on our maple tree! Will attract pollinators that don't sting and hopefully they will find it this year. To buy the bamboo alone to make one of my own would have cost more than this-Got a fun little wreath for my kitchen dining room display area. $2.00! Fits right in with the color scheme. I previously had a thrifted French style clock, but decided I did not need a third clock in the dining room-Spotted a nice Fleur-de-lis statue that I will paint for somewhere in the house. Not sure what color yet, maybe dark blue? I only found out a year or two ago that I'm part French. There is quite the history with the symbology of fleur-de-lis going back to very ancient times, including the Egyptians. It's a really fascinating symbol. I always thought it was just associated with the French but it goes way back before that-Found a nice summer weight blouse for $4, perfect condition. Nice large glass container that I will put flour into, $3.00. Really interesting that a lid that came with it actually has a canning-type rubber gasket on it, it fits inside the screw on lid, never seen this before-"},

Here's the before and after on that! (Before shot above) Originally when I applied for my new job it was listed as no remote work, 100% in the office. Between the time I was hired and the time it was posted things changed. I was very happy to find out I would be doing part-time remote/office work. It's really nice not to have a full time commute and be able to work from home some of the time. Lots of little things you can do in between working from home like moving sprinklers, running a load of laundry, etc. We were in the dilemma of what to do since we moved our personal home office stuff into the bedroom office. Now with that area being a kitchen buffet- We opt to use a laptop with a monitor/keyboard/mouse at home. We decided to move the small existing desk into the other spare bedroom and set up our home office there. We donated my sewing machine cabinet and put my sewing machine in the craft closet-   That made room for the small desk to go into that bedroom. Good excuse to deep clean! We deep cleaned that area, always hard to miss the dust bunnies behind the furniture-  Old desk, ready for when I start working remote So next- what kind of desk was I going to use to work from on? We looked around and I really wanted to get something that would be more like a piece of furniture. Eventually when I retire we won't need two desks so I figured we'd buy something nice that we could keep long-term. We didn't want to spend too much money so I looked around and finally settled on a desk from Costco. It was $200.00 off, ordered it online and had it delivered within a week. The thing that really sold me on the desk was it was mahogany hardwood construction. I wanted something really stable that was not going to get wobbly or weaken over time. I did shop around quite a bit and we didn't want cheap MDF, etc. Dave and I got started-Look at the Mahogany grain!!! WOW Dave and I put the new desk together and it looks great! We're keeping our home set up for now. We'll move our gear to the other bedroom when I start working from home. We didn't spend any money for this except for the new desk, $300.00. I really like the distressed farm style! If we ever decide to move the personal workstation into the living room it would be a nice fit.   Bonnie approves! I used some leftover fabric from my kitchen buffet, so I sewed up a curtain with velcro on the top. Conceals a food storage bookcase, dresses it up! Mini Grow Light System Hack-I wanted to start some seeds and we were going to set up our grow light system in our extra bedroom. It's worked really well before. I decided this year, based on last couple years, that I really didn't need to start quite as much. I suddenly had the brilliant idea that instead of using the whole 6' tall grow light rack, with multiple shelves, that I could just downsize it. I decided to put it on top of our buffet in the dining room. So Dave set up just one rack for me- Lettuce seedlings to thin Basil from the grocery store to go outside It's over the waterproof counter and there's power there. Easy to keep an eye on and I can start plenty of cucumbers, squashes, herbs and flowers there. Because our growing season can be kind of unpredictable here in the summer we really prefer to buy tomato starts. They get off to a quicker growth pattern. I know not everybody does that but it works for us. I just moved a few things around and I added my wooden organizer that I and the seeds are in close proximity for the gardening season. Now I just need to keep the cat out! Will fill the rest of the pots this weekend. Lettuce will go outside in pots. I have given up growing in the garden area."},
{"title": "Independence Days Challenge ", "date": "Mar 19, 2023", "text": "Independence Days Challenge-Here's what's been going on! It's finally warming up, grass is getting a bit green. Hopefully no more snow!!! 1. Plant Something- Getting ready to plant some lettuce starts in a little pot inside just to get something green growing. We've relocated a few things, trying to find room to put up our grow light rack to start some early vegetables. Otherwise too cold outside! After multiple mini snow storms we finally got into the 50s. Happy dance! 2. Harvest Something- Chives are up in the garden. So happy the girls have started laying! We have almost two and a half dozen eggs so far. It appears only two out of the three but that is another story listed below. I could be wrong on that, with two laying brown eggs and one white. Once we get three eggs a day we're good! 3. Preserve/Store Something- Bought some deeply discounted artisan breads and stashed those in the freezer. Keeping an eye on canned goods, etc. and stockpiling those. Found some good deals on some Augason Farms Butter powder on Amazon. Got a #10 can for $19.00 on sale. Got three freeze-dried entrees from Mountain House, nice to have on hand. 4. Manage Reserves- Get a Good Deal/Barter/Stock Up/Prep- Clearance priced wild bird food, clearance price winter clothes, and  several used Dvds and books from eBay. My food processor died, found a good deal online. My most recent read, highly recommended, this would make a GREAT movie!!! 5. Eat the Food- Try New Foods/Recipe- Working on trying some new Mediterranean diet recipes with some new and used cookbooks I was able to find. Another used book, while very heavy on the dairy (for us) great recipes!- 6. Build Community Food Systems- Not at this time.  7. Recycle/Re-Use- Dave has been cleaning up and reorganizing our garage. He needed to reorganize some specific areas. We were able to donate quite a few things and get them out of the garage. We're trying to create more workspace, with two cars and limited storage. It's much better, but a work in progress. I have the new kitchen \"buffet area\" (previous computer desk) done, with mostly thrifted items! I went for a Mediterranean feel, just waiting on buying some butcher block for the new top!8. Skill Up- I got a new job. Much higher pay, better benefits. My old job was a sinking ship and no one seemed to care. That gets really frustrating when you're trying to do the job right! I will be working part-time in the office and part-time at home, which is a nice bonus. Originally it was supposed to be fulltime in the office. Saves gas and the commute time! Kitty Bonnie will be happy.9. Regenerate What is Lost/Salvage Something- Saved the life of our hen Debbie. I looked at one day a couple months ago, when it was really bitter cold, and she was standing there with her tail down looking pretty sad. Didn't know what was going on so I brought her in right away, got her warmed up. When I was handling her I realized she was really, really thin. I thought maybe she was egg-bound since the other two had started laying. I gave her a warm bath and blew her dry.  She almost fell asleep! I waited a day or so nothing happened. So I did my first vent inspection and found no egg. She did have a hard little rubbery yellow thing attached to her tail feathers. I don't remember now what it was called, but it sounded like she might have a bacterial infection. Luckily I had some poultry antibiotics on hand and gave her several doses over the course of a couple of days. I also gave her food that she would eat, loves cat food apparently! So I tried to get her hydrated and eating, inside where it was wzrm. A double laundry basket worked great! With my work schedule I finally decided to put her back out with her flock. I would go out three times a day and give her some canned chicken, tuna, with water and oats, etc. She seemed like she got her appetite back. Within a week or two she started perking up and moving around more. She seems to have recovered completely, from what I can tell. She's eating, looks normal but not sure if laying yet? I'm really happy she pulled through and we'll see how things go from here. She's only two or three years old so she should have a long life ahead of her. Long live Debbie, named after Debbie the Space Chicken from Lost in Space-"},

{"title": "Waiting on Eggs, Spring Around The Corner? New Chairs! Happy Valentine's Day", "date": "Feb 14, 2023", "text": "Waiting on Eggs- My three lovely hens have been on strike since October or so. No eggs, nothing, nada. This is normal in the shorter months of the year and when they are molting. I decided that even though the days are longer to start turning on a regular light in the coop for an extra two/three hours a day. I'm also giving them some extra protein treats in hope that this will stimulate their hormones to start laying eggs. I told them the other day they need to start earning their keep! So far nothing, but I'm sure the eggs will start popping out soon! Miss Sunny  Spring Around The Corner?Spring is around the corner, and Dave has started doing a little pruning here and there. Then we got an inch or so of snow last night! Very icy drive to work, but pretty! All roads melted by the afternoon- Our apple tree survived the winter snap we had in October!!! Happy dance!  We've seen a lot of trees that don't drop all their leaves die from this kind of thing. Food prices being what they are we are looking at adding some beds in the front yard for annual vegetables. We wanted to look nice so we will do some kind of integrated landscaping with it. We always try to remember that our neighbors have to look at our yard every day and curb appeal is a great part of being a good neighbor! Nobody wants to look at a junked front yard. I have seen some people who put gardens in their front yard that are pretty untidy and look just messy. We like to have things like natural but organized. Too early to plant the summer vegetables so I may start up my grow lights and start some other cool weather veggies. I bought a small windowsill planter to start some lettuces in...     Bonnie approved  New Chairs! We decided to bite the bullet and buy two new chairs for our living room. We had had our two other overstuffed chairs for almost 15 years. I had re-stuffed them, added foam and bought new covers. They were just at the point though of really sagging, so it was time to replace. We wanted to buy two Flexsteel chairs but it was just way out of our budget. We love our Flexsteel couch, worht every penny! We opted for a brand that was a little below that but super durable frame, etc. We found a style that we liked, chose the fabric and ordered two of them. They were supposed to take up to about 3 months but only took about 5 weeks! Nice surprise. They're really super supportive and really like the slightly smaller footprint and clean lines. Great reading chairs. In a smaller house you don't want to have too much furniture in your living room. That can make it look even smaller. It's always nice to have some open space for the eye. We opted to spend extra money to have a fabric treatment done. We did that on our couch and it's really paid for itself. Even if you get something a little oily on the fabric a wet clean cold cloth will take it right off. Good investment! We are thinking about having our couch reupholstered at some point to update it a bit. For now we'll leave as is, but we will probably have to get new foam cores in the cushions since they are getting a little squishy. The store we bought the couch at recommended that and that makes sense after 10 years or so. Happy Valentine's Day"},
{"title": "Saving Money On Meat & More! Dining Room Refresh- DIY Reupholstered Chairs & Paint", "date": "Feb 4, 2023", "text": "Saving Money On Meat And More!-As we all know grocery prices get higher and higher. While we don't eat meat everyday we do eat some. I was recently at a Fred Meyer grocery store. I browsed around and stumbled onto some huge 9 lb. pork roasts. They were $24.00 each. I read down on the sticker at the bottom (we are members of the Savings Club) the roasts were $8.00 each. That's about $1 a pound!  I decided to buy two for that price! When I got home I cut both of them in half. I created two boneless roasts and two bone-in. I used my Food Saver bags and froze three of them. I roasted one of them with the bone in, low and slow with herbs. The meat came out fabulous! Very juicy and tender. I served one meal with fresh veggies. Another meal with roasted yams. A third meal I did shredded pork with barbecue sauce and Memphis style coleslaw on top, WONDERFUL! Recipe here Memphis Style Coleslaw-What a deal! Good reminder to keep your eyes open when shopping and try different stores. I have heard recently there is getting to be a shortage of Baking Powder. Buy some! It's cheap and can be used for all kinds of baked goods. This is a really great preparedness item. I love Starbuck's Strawberry Acai Refresher, but they are just too expensive. I found a copycat recipe and made my own! Pretty close! Recipe here Copycat StrawberryAcai RefresherFirst you simmer white grape juice and strawberries to create a base concentrate, then strain to get the berry juice-    Last I added the powders listed on the recipe, stir and refrigerate. It keeps for about two weeks. You use 1/2 concentrate and 1/2 water. I found some freeze-dried strawberries at Trader Joe's for $3.00 and I topped with those just like Starbuck's (a little darker), but much cheaper! I bought the powders listed on the recipe. Those will last a LONG time and you could use in smoothies. You could play with this recipe and use other fruits if desired. Fresh strawberries here are terrible so I bought frozen. Worked great! I bought two totes of organic mushrooms at Costco, will dehydrate most of them for storage, $5.00 for a 24 oz- Not to forget pets, bought a big back of cat food for Bonnie to go in a tote with oxygen absorbers. I still have two extra bags of chicken feed.  Now if they would just start laying!!! Should be any day....Dining Room Refresh- DIY Reupholstered Chairs & Paint- Years ago I bought two used French style chairs for the dining table. The fabric was worn so I had them reupholstered for about $40.00 each. Over the years they got food stains, shampooed them and spot treated them I could never get them really clean- They were just past the point of no return. I saw YouTube video on how to reupholster these kinds of chairs. I knew that I could do it myself and save a ton of money! I looked around for fabrics, did not want to do plaid/stripes since it has to really aligned to look good. I stumbled onto some denim fabric with embroidered dragonflies at the checkout stand at the local fabric store- I had planned on getting just plain navy blue playing upholstery fabric. When I saw this fabric I knew this was the right one! To start I used a blow dryer to soften up the glue stick material that the upholsterer had used to attach the trim and removed all of that-   Next I cut out large pieces of fabric to cover the chairs and ironed it. I read it's really important always iron it before you start stretching it to get it really flat. Dave helped me in a few spots and I stapled it around really well. I did this on top of a card table, helped a lot to have it UP- So clean!I was not able to find any trim locally so ordered some on Amazon in Navy. I wish I had gone a little bit lighter on the color but it's really hard to see on a computer. After I got everything upholstered, I trimmed off the excess, and then hot glued it all the way around with the trim. It looks so much better!    Clean and will last for quite a few years. Not perfect but works for me. The total for the fabric was about $25, the trim was about $8.00, I have some fabric and trim left over. I might do some kind of a fun pillow for the summer.   I started thinking that I wanted to repaint my little shelving unit that hangs on our dining room wall. It was a deep blue. With the new chair and buffet fabric it was a lot of blue. I had seen the PBS new series All Creatures Great and Small and loved the green accents in the kitchen. I also liked the green paint on my antique wood-handled kitchen utensils-   PBS All Creatures Great and Small Kitchen shotIt's called French green or Antique green. Previously I had used spray paint but was not able to find this color anywhere. I settled on a large bottle of craft paint at Hobby Lobby, about $6 each. I bought some new foam brushes, wide ones worked really well for the two big shelves. I knew it would take two coats especially on the metal side pieces. I love the color! I wish I could have found chalk paint in this color, but it does have a satin finish which I like. Took two coats- I finished my thrifted shadow box with the WWII chicken print. I added broken egg shells, wheat and Lavender- Says \"I am a brave little WWII hen, don't eat much but produce a lot\""},
{"title": "Best Thrifting Scores! Installing A New Microwave, Kitchen Project- Turning A Desk Into A Buffet !", "date": "Jan 5, 2023", "text": "Best Thrifting Scores! We had some donations to make and I had the thrift store bug. I am redoing an area in the kitchen and wanted to add a little bit more French Mediterranean decor items . We decided to go out New Year's Eve day and dropped off some donations at our local Idaho Youth Ranch. We went inside and there just wasn't much in the store. They had a fire sometime in the summer at their warehouse and had asked people to stop donating. I don't know if they just never recovered or what happened but I've never seen their store that empty except for tons of clothing. We decided to go to Goodwill up the street. Oh wow wow wow were they ever stocked up!!! I started going through the home decor section and first found this really pretty pitcher made in Mexico for water for our dining table. Really nice size, $4.00-Next I found a Ziploc plastic bag section of the store where they put all kinds of random things together. I found a brand new Teavana brand steeping tea brewer. Basically you put your loose tea in, fill with water let it steep. It comes with its own little coaster. After it's steeps when you set it on top of a mug and the weight of the liquid releases the tea through the stainless steel filter in the bottom. Pretty ingenious! It was brand new along with a few other crafting goodies, $3.00! New it is $20.00. The really nice thing about it is it's small and solves the problem of bulk teas that I like to brew. When I use a tea ball or tea spoon filter it seems like something always leaks through with chunks of tea in the bottom of the cup. The filter worked great!Next I found a shadow box that was going to go perfect for a little vintage World War II French hen print that I found online. I inserted the photo, I'm going to add things like wheat sprigs, seeds and broken eggshells. So far it's really cute! In French at the top of the photo it says solve your barnyard problems. Then down in the middle it says something about a girl's school. At the bottom it says I Am A Brave Little Hen I don't eat much but I produce a lot. I stumbled on this print and loved it! We'll play around with the frame, which was $1.50.As far as Mediterranean/French I found a cabbage leaf serving platter, $4.99. Many of these kinds of ceramics are made in Majorca, Spain- Found a really cute whitewashed flower with galvanized metal and a jute center, $3.00. Really reminds me of a bakery we go to in McCall (Stacy's Cake's). They have lots vintage baking tins and make flowers out of them for decorations. It's up in the dining room now-I found a faux lavender pot for $1.99- And then a Fleur delis-style statue/baluster for $3.00. I wasn't sure about the green but it's growing on me. I had planned of painting it white but I think I like the green. Time will tell...Next I found a serving platter, about 11 inches across that I will hang in my wall once I get a plate holder. It's a really nice brand, lots of available online, for $4 it was a bargain. At Home Depot a while back I bought a faux miniature olive tree that will also dress up the space this will be going-Last for a couple dollars I found a Rachael Ray olive oil picture, like new and my favorite color! Washed really well with very hot soapy water and just like new, is $20.00 new!  On the actual free side of things I found this nice free printable online. It's for my frame I already had for the holidays. I had originally put one with the same French wording but it just didn't print out right. I finally found one I like and it was free! Will save that for next year-I was looking for a greenery swag for my living room but all of the Christmas items were completely gone. Will have to wait for next year. My entire haul (small items not shown) was $30.00!  Installing A New Microwave- Dave and I were relaxing nicely, about ready to eat on New Year's Eve, when suddenly our microwave arced and that was the end of that. I was cooking some veggies. We had it for about 13 years so we got our money out of it, for sure. So New Year's Day we spent shopping for a new microwave. I had pulled up a few models on YouTube and did a little research the night before. All our appliances are white so we were sticking with that. I noticed that a lot of the newer microwaves have recessed handles which I really like. Lower profile is always good for me. We stopped at Lowe's to look and see what they had and we lucked out. We found one in stock for $279 with the recessed handle! Dave and I installed it New Year's Day and it works great, and much quieter. Also made me finally really deep, deep clean my range top and stove. I took all the knobs off and scrubbed with really hot soapy water and a toothbrush. Scrubbed down the upper section really well, the bottom drawer and door. Looks much much better. All in all Santa came a bit late with that, but we got a good deal and got what we wanted. There is a series called Profile that we really liked with all of the digital keypads down along the bottom in a thin strip but they are much more expensive and it wasn't that important to us. Happy that we have one installed and it works!  Old dead one  We pulled the old one and proteced the glass top stove  New one out of box, Whirlpool  Installed and we cleaned up!     My inspiration from Romantiskahem.blogspot Kitchen Project- Turning A Desk Into A Buffet!  I saw the photo at the top a while back. It gave me an idea and so here's the reveal! Here's the history first- When we bought our house we inherited a desk in the dining room which we decided to keep. For a long time it was good to have our computer there, work online, pay bills and be able to chat with each other- Earlier this year we decided to move the computer into the home office that I used to work remotely. When I changed jobs and went to work in an office we decided we could really use that space in the kitchen for other things. I'd always wanted to put in a buffet there. The plan right now is to put a slab of butcher block type wood and replace the counter. Eventually I'd like Dave to remove the cabinet, pull out the rolling cart and add some finished shelves. I found the fabric at Joanne's and loved it! I bought a white tension rod and sewed it up! I wanted something sort of Mediterranean-ish.   Kind of reminds me of the ocean   Hides lots of stuff! Next sewing project will be re-upholstering my two dining chairs, they need some love! After winter decor is put away I will put out my French/coutry decor- Flowers bloomed in time for New Year's!"},

Maybe it's the shorter days and we had one of our \"inversions\" this month. Very cold and gray with the stagnant air hanging in the valley. Luckily they didn't last too long! December was busy- right after our anniversary was Thanksgiving, then my birthday, then daughter's birthday, then grandson's, then Christmas! I bought gifts starting in the summer and stashed them. Great way to save $! Our grand kids get plenty of plastic toy gifts from others, so I load up on books and art supplies for them. Lovely flowers bloomed this year in time for Christmas Eve! We had a nice lunch buffet at my house with my two daughters and their children. With freezing rain in the forecast we moved it forward into the afternoon instead of evening. Sadly our one daughter who lives in Oregon was not able to make it since the highways were closed with a terrible ice storm, better to be safe at home.  Dave's gift of a new French butter keeper, made by a local artist in McCall (I picked it out)-  We've had a lot of medical stuff going on the last several months. Not much time for blogging! Dave had an eye injury, with a horrible ER experience. Short version- they never had an eye Dr. see him or even get a call to one. We were able to call the eye Dr. on call at Dave's eye clinic on a Sunday and he opened up his clinic and saw Dave. What a miracle! We got a good diagnosis and he was treated and recovered.  Dave also had a chronic ankle injury for a few years, wearing a boot for months really slowed him down. He's doing PT now and sounds like he can get a full recovery. I've had chronic leg pain for months, did diagnostics and luckily seems to be ergonomics at work. My chair was cutting off circulation from what I can tell. I elevated my feet and started acupuncture. Getting improvement already! In the fall I went thru some cardiac issues, had a procedure and finally came out the other side. Changing meds was quite the drama. After weeks things finally calmed down! I'm feeling fine now and stable. I am grateful for the excellent medical care I received and my insurance. We weren't able to spend Christmas with our daughter living in Oregon. There were several ice storms and the highways were closed. We told her we missed her but better to stay home and be safe! We did some Facetime with our other daughters and family here for a Christmas Eve early dinner. We got hit with freezing rain too later in the evening, so we changed dinner to late lunch. We loved seeing our three grandchildren! Youngest redhead is walking, and the two six year olds are super fun! So glad we live in the area!!!I'm very grateful for my family, especially Dave's support thru my cardiac issues.  My Dietary Shift-With all the stress of medical issues I was eating way too much junk food. That caught up with me when I had my labs done in November. My doctor mentioned looking at starting the Mediterranean Diet style of eating. I heard about that before but didn't know quite as much as I do now. I've started it and I'm feeling better already. It is much more plant-based than I realized. While I'm not going vegan meat is used a lot less. Dave and I are both very dairy sensitive so we're not eating tons of dairy/cheeses. I got some really good information from this website, and he also has some good YouTube videos. I found this nice assortment of recipes 20 Mediterranean Diet Recipes  I LOVED this video by Greek chef Diane Kockilas Flavors of Greek Ikarian Longevity  Ikaria,Greece is a \"Blue Zone\" where people live very long, healthy lives.

We had our first really big snow storm come through Oregon and Idaho Friday. Woke up to falling snow in the morning melting on the road to work. A few days before that got some snow up in the foothills, but this was our big first Mountain snow. Story here Ski Area Excited or Early Snow   Just in time as the garden had gotten it's last harvest- The chickens are enjoying having the full run of the garden area now. Made our last couple of pizzas with homegrown tomatoes. We do have some hardy kale and collard greens still! Closed the vents on the foundation, winterized the cars with new wiper blades, snow/scrapers and a spare blankie just in case. The summer quilt and blanket on the bed are gone, I put on our nice big warm comforter! Dave and I switched to our winter down coats, kitty Bonnie has discovered the floor heating vents and gets some nice warm air. Since we adopted her in last December this is her first Autumn going into Winter. I still miss Anya but having Bonnie here has been a real comfort- We recently brought Anya home. One of the things they included with her ashes was a paw print of hers- Made me cry it was so sweet. Anya always loved watching the snow fly. I think she thought the snowflakes were bugs and she'd meow at them! One of my last photos of her  Winterizing The Coop- The weather was really warm in October and then suddenly dropped the last week. After a heavy rain and some snow we decided to put up the sun room and attach it to the coop. Dave pulled out all the components that we stored behind the coop. In the garage we attached the plastic and the frame until it was all put together-  mid processAfter we tie wrapped all the plastic tie wrapped on and got the frame stable Dave and I carried it out into the backyard. Dave attached it to the coop and now the chickens have extra space through the rest of the winter! The sun rooms have worked really great over the years. Dave also deep cleaned the coop so the chickens are ready for a nice cold winter. It's been interesting the price change on bales of pine shavings . We use the deep litter method and pine shavings are great. A bale is currently about $20 which is more than double in about the last 6 months!!! Not sure if this is due to fuel prices or more the popularity of coops in the area or both? I'm glad I did stock up on a couple of extra bags of feed a few months back.  Otherwise they are all cozy! Shot from last year-   On the low setting Fun Online Ikea Holiday Scores-I love Ikea but there's no store in Boise sadly. One of my biggest complaints with Ikea was that they don't sell any holiday decor online. They are finally selling some, but not all. I love Scandinavian folk art and there's some things I really love (not much of fan of modern Scandinavian design).  I was able to finally find a few things online of their holiday decor and I ordered some! One of them was not a holiday item but a pseudo oil electric lamp (see above). There used to be one in a really dark green that I loved but I didn't want to spend the money. I found this one that was cream colored, was $10 off, ($20) and I bought it. I had actually never seen something marked \"ON SALE\" at Ikea.  It's perfect on my end table when I want just a little bit of light and it's adjustable. Since it's LED it's bright when it's on all the way, and I bought a spare bulb. The glass and metal is very heavy duty and durable. I also found some really cute Ikea Christmas tree ornaments, candles and a really cute little tray. Tree ornaments $15, very much like Mercury glass! I did splurge on these, even prettier in real life!!! From Ikea Vinterfint Ornaments  A cute tray $4-"},

She didn't care if our grandchildren rubbed her fur the wrong way, and she looked after us when we were under the weather. Years ago I had foot surgery and had to lay on my side on the couch for 3 days with my foot elevated. Dave told me the only time she left my side was to either eat, get a drink of water, or use the cat box. The rest of time she was just glued to me. Our kitty caretaker. She passed very peacefully with us there with her. I told her it was okay to go and that she was so brave.I'm sure she's with the cat Angels up in heaven because they were happy to such a sweet soul back. I know we'll see her again someday. I'm so grateful that she was in our life. I miss her terribly..."},
{"title": "Winter Around The Corner, Frugal - Research, Replace, Repair & Reorganize, Easy Free Mailbox Post Upgrade!", "date": "Oct 8, 2022", "text": "Winter Around The Corner- Autumn is definitely here with all the colors starting to change! We have been in the low to mid 70's during the day and 40's at night. After our brutal summer of hundred degree weather for a month or more it's a really nice change. Forecast in the 60's for next week. Time to get out the winter warmer clothes, etc. Will be cleaning the coop and getting that ready for winter. We're still picking some tomatoes and peppers! Will be freezing some this weekend. I decided not to can any this year because I use them up relatively quickly. I canned our pears this last weekend. Got 14 qts, a pear crumble and some left to eat fresh.  I've been dealing with some major health issues which has been exhausting, but the good news is there's a light at the end of the tunnel.  Our lovely cat Anya started having breathing issues the last few days. We took her to the Vet and she had fluid in her chest cavity. They were able to get some out and she's breathing much better now, but at 14 years old this is not good. We will see how her labs come back, then think about what we need to do at this time. Always hard to think about losing your companion animals. Our last three pets, two dogs and one cat, lived to be 17 years old. I assumed that would be the magic number for Anya, but time will tell. The Vet told me in the 26 years she practiced veterinary medicine she NEVER had a cat start PURRING before when she was pulling out fluids. She asked her vet tech if there was rumbling in her chest? Her assistant said no she's just purring. That's our Anya! Always mellow.   Frugal Research, Replace, Repair & Reorganize-Sometimes life throws you curve balls and sometimes there's several at a time! We noticed a few different things going on around the house. Things like our Moen kitchen faucet was starting to leak black liquids from the middle. The Food Saver set I bought had a handheld device that did not work. My small bathroom Ikea faucet had gotten pretty clogged from the road construction and I needed a new filter. So time to do some research. Dave said that Moen would replace cartridges for free since they had basically lifetime warranties on their kitchen faucets.  Here came the research. Ikea has excellent customer service on their faucets too. Again I did some more research. Ditto doing research by contacting Food Saver for a replacement handheld vacuum attachment. I called FoodSaver and let them know that the attachment that I had in the box did not fit. Short phone call and an email later I attached photos of the items. In the mail I got a replacement that should fit! It didn't, back to square one. Will call next week. I got on the Moen website and was able to order a replacement cartridge for free. Dave was able to install it in a few minutes and now it's working great and no leaks!  I got on the Ikea website and found the part for the bathroom faucet and ordered two new filters for free. Previously I had ordered one for other master bathroom faucet I forgot to order one for the small bathroom faucet. Just unscrew old one, insert the new, water pressure fixed! Next, our oven element died, during pre-heating it to put in a pear tart! Great timing, sigh. We called around and made an appointment to have the element replaced and the door opened up to clean the inside of the glass that I can't get to. When the guy showed up he didn't seem to know what we were talking about and said that they would have to spend a half a day labor taking the door off and cleaning the inner glass. We decided to cancel. Dave went and was able to install the element and I can live with the drips on the glass. While there are a lot of YouTube videos about how to clean the inside of the inner glass on a oven door it does void your warranty. It also seems like it would be pretty tricky to get back together and workable. Sometimes it's just easier to live with something so that works for us- Oven cleaning on my list! Our pantry rack was a bit of a disaster area. I looked a little bit more critically, was able to shuffle things around a bit more and use the space better. I had recently added a few bags of bread flour that I got at Costco. Soon I will pack those into some buckets with oxygen absorbers, but for now the bags work fine. We're lucky we've never had any pests in the house, of any kind. Soon I will break these down into smaller plastic bags and freeze them for a week to kill any possible tiny visitors, then re-pack-I did a lot of research the last several months on solar chargers for homes. I wanted something low cost and reliable. I bought a Bluetti EB3A Portable Power Station 600W 268Wh. Still on sale here Eb3a Portable Power Station with info listed. I fired it up, charged it and so far so good! Will probably buy the solar panels to go with it soon. This will not power a home but will work for things like laptops, phones, small lights, C pap machines, etc. Company has a very good ratings, more later-Easy Free Mailbox Post Upgrade!Our street paving is finally done with sidewalks installed! One of the things the county was supposed to do was put in a new post/mailbox since they tore the old ones out for construction. Well they did put in a new post, but they put our old faded mailbox back. Ditto the neighbors. Shocker. I told Dave that everybody either had silver, black, or white mailboxes. Something different that would be fun. I asked Dave if he could trim out the 4 x 4 post with some spare Cedar that we had on hand. He did great job! I looked around several places and was able to find a dark green mailbox. After he trimmed at the Cedar we ordered the mailbox, (nobody had it in stock) and he installed it. I LOVE it! A little bit distinctive with some little architectural interest instead of a plain old mailbox post. The wood was free so it was just the price of the mailbox, about $25 bucks. The cedar will fade into a nice gray..."},

Autumn's Almost Here ", "date": "Sep 10, 2022", "text": "September National Preparedness Month/Is This Redundant?On some level I almost don't feel like even posting this. But since it is National Preparedness Month I thought I'd add just a good few reminders and links... Ready.gov Be Informed   Redcross.org Emergency Preparedness Checklist  You can check out my previous posts on this topic under the \"topics\" tab on the right side. Don't forget to prep for your pets!!! Ready.gov PetsIf you've been watching the national and international news you know that there have been major catastrophic crop failures, livestock failures, floods, fires, fuel shut offs, war, it's the perfect storm. Everyone should be really preparing for food shortages, exorbitant fuel charges and/or shortages. This news is from this week, time to stock up and maybe buy a turkey for the holidays-Ohio Egg Farm Euthanizes 3 Million Chickens I recently came into a small amount of money and instead of putting it into my retirement account I cashed it out to buy hard goods. I bought about 6 months worth of chicken feed (now $25 a bag up from $12.99 a while back) to get us all the way through the winter and more pine shavings for the coop. Ditto for the cat food. I also bought more things to stash like OTC meds.  I saw a really great deal for a Food Saver vacuum system at Costco for only $75! It came with a starter kit of bags, a really great deal! My old pressure bag system was on its way out, not a surprise since it was pretty cheap. It's good to invest in those kind of food preservation items. I have had ZERO freezer burn with those bags!!! I felt it was a better $ investment than sitting gathering little to no interest for a while. In some ways I feel like cashing it all out and doing something different but I am hopeful that I will still be able to retire someday. If you've seen anything lately about people's thermostats getting locked up by the utilities- I think this is a preview of things to come. I know our local power company asked us to voluntarily sign up to have our power lowered during the hottest part of the summer days. In return they would give us a little bit of money at the end of the summer. We passed. We try to be conscious of our energy and water use. We do a lot of mulching, planting trees on our lot, but we still use/need the AC.  Having said that fuel charges are looking really gruesome in Europe. I think this is also a preview of things to come in the states. I bought some flannel sheets to stash and we have tons of bedding, kerosene and propane heaters. Some people still think that nothing will change, they may have something called normalcy bias. Everything will be fine because it always has been. From Wiki- Normalcy bias, or normality bias, is a cognitive bias which leads people to disbelieve or minimize threat warnings. Consequently, individuals underestimate the likelihood of a disaster, when it might affect them, and its potential adverse effects. The normalcy bias causes many people to not adequately prepare for natural disasters, market crashes, and calamities caused by human error. About 70% of people reportedly display normalcy bias during a disaster. The normalcy bias can manifest in response to warnings about disasters and actual catastrophes. Such disasters include market crashes, motor vehicle accidents, natural disasters like a tsunami, and war. Normalcy bias has also been called analysis paralysis, the ostrich effect, and by first responders, the negative panic. The opposite of normalcy bias is overreaction, or worst-case scenario bias, in which small deviations from normality are dealt with as signals of an impending catastrophe.A classic example was Ukraine. People were warned to leave, Russia was surrounding the country for months and months, and most stayed. They really never thought Russia would invade, despite the obvious signs. The very wealthy never worry either. I heard this quote two days ago and it really stuck with me-People of privilege will always risk their complete destruction rather than surrender any material part of their advantage. Intellectual myopia, often called stupidity, is no doubt a reason. But the privileged also feel that their privileges, however egregious they may seem to others, are a solemn, basic, God-given right- John Kenneth Galbraith, Canadian Economist.Autumn's Almost Here-We have been under a Heat Dome like a lot of the West the last few months, with many many weeks and weeks of over 100° weather. It's been very smoky here the last week with multiple fires in Eastern Oregon and here in Idaho. We definitely had a much smaller crop of tomatoes, but green ones are still on the vine. Tomatoes won't set fruit when it's over 80 or 85°. I don't have enough to can this year but will freeze some. I already made some wonderful salsa. Not many apples at all, luckily I canned a lot and froze some last year! Lots of pears on the tree, probably ready to can next weekend. We hit our 43° morning yesterday! Finally getting down into the 80s this week and the 70s late next week. May be some rain, which we desperately need. We're fortunate we had plenty of water for crops and our animals, some are not so lucky. We'll be stashing some mulch and other gardening needs for next year. Those things are easy to store. I'm packing up the summer decor and almost ready to put out pumpkins!"},

Amazon has also become the giant, not treating their employees well, and I suspect they sell their data to whoever. I also suspect they will go out of business in the not-too-distant future. If China goes into Taiwan, and I think they will, a major cut off of Chinese goods may hit the U.S. right away. Time will tell. When fuel goes back up (and I think it will), the prices will soar as well affecting consumers. I never started blogging to make money, just to document our journey and share it. I have made some great friends online and read their journeys too. And congrats if you still actually READ!!!  Some just looks at photos and move on. It's sad to see some of the dumbing down in social media. I miss people who can write well, for more than a short paragraph. So there you go, that's the skinny.

It's been a cooker! I am very grateful that we have air conditioning and well air-conditioned workplaces. I feel sorry for some of my co-workers who don't have central air. I grew up in Southern California, never had air conditioning though and we survived. Just keeping everything well-watered has been a daily project. We have mulched even more this summer. The chickens are doing well but are not laying as much as usual. They just get over heated, nature's response. We're making sure they have plenty of water, cool treats, they have already lots of shade, and keep wetting things down. Was 55 this week which was a nice change and days getting shorter! I made a nice summer dinner this weekend, spicy fried chicken (great cold!), potato salad, fresh homegrown organic tomatoes and green onions. Yum! We went to Costco recently and they were out of their famous apple pies. NO APPLE PIES! Staff told us they were out of apples. Dave mentioned that this last spring a huge apple storage facility in Washington state was hit with ants. They lost their entire facility. Good reminder to not assume anything nowadays with perfect storm of supply issues. The good news is they had bags of unbleached bread flour $9 for 25 lbs. Since I've started making homemade bread regularly, I bought one bag and then went back and bought two more. It's Turkey Brand from Lehi Mills in Utah-           25 Lbs for $8.99! I also bought more local honey, a bottle of vanilla, raisins, not only for winter baking but just food in general.

We also harvested all of our peaches! I canned about 12 quarts, froze about five and we have more in the kitchen that are ripening. Most of those I will probably bake with soon or eat fresh. If that's too many I will freeze the rest.

{"title": "Heat Dome/Garden Progress, A More Resilient Kitchen, Dehydrating Eggs!", "date": "Aug 2, 2022", "text": "From Survival Quote Series Year ZeroHeat Dome/Garden Progress-I don't know about anybody else but we have been under the heat Dome that's been all over the news. It's been in the 100°s for the last 2 weeks. But we lucked out today, it was in the '80s and it RAINED this morning! Not a lot of rain, but enough to really cool things down. We have just been watering, watering and watering the yarden. I've been taking extra cool care of our chickens. I use a water mister near their shade area, hose it down once or twice a day, and give them cool treats. Our tomatoes been growing like crazy in the heat! Typically tomatoes don't set fruit over about 80° or so, luckily there were lots of baby tomatoes already on the vine. It's made a HUGE difference in the production in the garden with more SUN. We did a major professional prune a while back. What a difference!!! We finally had our first harvest! I picked one medium sized tomato and two lemon cucumbers. The lemon cucumbers are doing amazing, they are growing so fast! I decided not to plant any pickling cucumbers since I found a wonderful local farm where I can buy them fresh. I made the best fermented pickles ever last year using their cukes! We have a good amount of peaches on the front peach tree, just starting to change colors. Our apple tree is running a little bit light on the harvest this year. That's nature. That's why I wanted to plant three different kinds of fruit trees. The blackberries are ripening now as well. Pretty soon I will be canning fruit! I also bought a pressure cleaner so I'm going to start canning some meats and non-acid vegetables. I hope to be also canning soups for the winter. With potential blackout/brownouts/fuel shortage good to have easy, healthy fast foods on hand. If you're not getting prepared for some future difficulties better late than never! I heard about a shortage coming of Garbanzo beans so I bought about eight lbs. of dried in the bulk section. They're tucked away in glass jars with O2 absorbers. I also got a great deal on Augason Farms freeze dried strawberries, $20.00 for a #10 can, nice deal. Still on Amazon clearance. Never to late to get things in order...A More Resilient Kitchen-When we bought our house almost 20 years ago there was a built-in desk in the dining room/kitchen. That worked out pretty well and we decided to use it for that. Later I really wanted to remove all of that and put in a buffet, but we never put new counters in the kitchen. I had hoped we would be able to do solid countertops and turn that area into a buffet for storage. Fast forward to now. I decided since I'm not working from home anymore to move our kitchen office into the spare bedroom. I'm hoping we'll be able to put some butcher block where the current countertop is. In the meantime I decided to take back my kitchen. We moved the computer system into the home office, where I previously worked at my job. That opened up the entire counter. I cleared everything off and wiped everything down. It's amazing how many dust bunnies were under there! I even had room to put out my radio/CD player!I made 2 loaves of bread in the new (thrifted) bread machine there, Honey Oat bread (recipe in my Pinterest bread folder)-Great flavor and crumb!Next I used the same recipe, but used 1 cup WW flour and 1 teaspoon dough enhancer, excellent result!Hole from the paddle, great otherwise! I will keep playing around and plan to make some herb breads too. One of the things I wanted to start using the area for is for dehydrating-Orange slices for winter teasIt will be really handy to have that area for cooling home-canned bloing jars instead of the top of my dining table. When we have lots of company over in the winter for the holidays I can use it as a serving area. So far so good! I'm leaving the dehydrator there for now so I can run various batches including eggs. More on that below...18 eggs in there!Dehydrating Eggs!I've seen a few different blogs and YouTube videos that had information on how to dehydrate fresh eggs. I decided to try that! Since we have a bumper crop of our own organic eggs it's a good shelf stable way  to preserve them! Basically I ran about 9 of our eggs at a time through our Magic Bullet until blended, 18 totla in the 1st batch. I had previously bought some silicone trays for inside my food dehydrator, link here Dehydrator Trays I had the trays stacked and simply carefully poured the eggs in. The temperature I read everywhere was to do about 140° for about 18 hours or so. Probably depends on the humidity where you live. Here's the photos of the process-Mostly dry, checking for donenessdry and crispy, looks like corn flakes!I ran the chunks thru the Magic Bullet again (clean and dry), came out perfect. I added to O2 absorbers in the glass jars. Just treat like raw eggs and cook. You can use in baked goods, for scrambled, eggs etc. Great video here from one of my fave Youtubers with lots of info!  From RoseRed Homestead-"},
{"title": "Homesteading Thrifting Finds/Pressure Canning, Veggie Garden Growing! My Eton Mess, RIP Rosie", "date": "Jul 7, 2022", "text": "Homesteading Thrifting Finds/Pressure Canning-Here's an update of some things that we've been doing here! My thrift store radar was pinging the other day, I went to Goodwill, came around the corner and saw something I have been thinking about buying new. With the price of wheat going up and up and no end in sight in the future, I had thought about buying a bread machine. Since I work full time I thought it would be nice to buy a machine where I could just dump everything in and have a loaf of bread! You can also use it to make a lot of different kinds of doughs for other purposes as well. I really just didn't want to spend the money on it. So I went thrifting and what did I find? A Breadman Ultimate bread making machine! For a whopping $10.00! I love the fact that loaf goes sideways and is not shaped like a square- I plugged it in at the thrift store, the power came on, looks like it's been very well taken care of and hardly used. It even came with the owner's manual and the recipe book! I wiped it down, washed it and it almost looks brand new. Will give it a test run this weekend. While I love Dave's Killer Bread, and a few of the other whole grain breads, it's just getting too expensive. I really loaded up on flours the last eight months, as well as wheat berries. So I can definitely make bread a lot cheaper than I can buy it. And fresher too!  I also found a really nice big heavy class Anchor Hocking storage jar. Like new as well! $4.00. I did some research on how to dehydrate eggs, since we have our own, and turn into egg powder. Egg powder will take up a lot less space than freezing eggs in our freezer. I'm also trying to move away from relying on our freezer in case we have brown outs/blackouts in the next 6 months and ongoing. After doing research I realized that I could use my existing dehydrator I just needed to buy some food grade silicone liner trays. I found a good deal on Amazon, $14.00 for four, and they fit perfect! I may also make some fruit leathers for the grandkids- Basically you do about 8 to 10 eggs at a time, blended, and dehydrate at 140° until completely dry. I think I read that can take about 10 to 12 hours or more. I will be doing that shortly since we have almost six dozen eggs! Will fire it up this weekend and post results. I've been doing some research for a while and decided to start doing pressure canning. For a long time there was a lot in the media about NOT being able to use a glass top stove. After I did a lot of research I realized that you can, however you have to make sure about the weight, the size of the burner, and the canner. After doing research I decided to buy a Presto 16 quart pressure canner. It will be a good smaller size for us. I did research on my stove top and how big the canner would be. I was really excited to see that the thick round part of the canner bottom fits exactly my large burner, perfect-This was something that I saw lots of places is really mandatory. There's also weight limit on most glass top stove of about 50 lbs so I didn't want to get a huge canner. I was really excited when it arrived it fits perfect! I will not be dragging across the glass either, and was advised to only have the one pot on the stove at a time. Best be careful! Looking forward to canning meat, beans, soups and veggies! Will post more of that over time. Veggie Garden Growing!After all the crazy weather we finally got our vegetable garden planted and cleared off our deck! There were so many pots and plants on the deck for so many weeks I couldn't even see what the deck look like underneath it all! 4th of July weekend we made a push on Sunday and Dave and I laid out all the veggies and strawberries. He planted all of that while I was able to plant up all the herbs, flowers and some of the perennials. I can finally see my deck again! Sorry about that thumbWe have a really nice mix of vegetables this year and we're very fortunate found some really good deals. With my job change and other craziness I was never able to start any seeds in our grow light plant rack. We have planted several kinds of tomatoes, two kinds of cucumbers, collard greens, curly kale , three or four kinds of peppers, some small refrigerator size watermelon, yellow squash, and something else I'm probably forgetting! Mound garden this year, gorgeous from all the rain! flowers near the veggie gatelots of veggies! New strawberry row, will add more next yearLuna peeking out behind the gateLots of thornless blackberries! Lavender to harvest, I leave 30% or more for the beesWhite lavenderSmall watermelon, my 1st!We mulched everything really well and my herbs really took off in this hot weather! Now we're finally into the part of just watering and keeping an eye on everything. We're finally in the mid-90s and this will probably be the norm for a while. I think the rain is finally over! Need to mulch the strawberries a lot more, taking a beating in the heat! My Eton Mess-I read about a traditional Eton Mess, a British dessert and decided to try it! Jamie Oliver did something pretty similar. Eton Mess is a traditional British summertime dessert of gooey meringue, sweet strawberries and rich cream in a generous sticky mess. Here's what I did- crushed about 3/4 cup fresh strawberries and 1/2 cup fresh blueberries. I used a potato masher, added a few Tbl of sugar and left on the counter to get the juices going. I bought some Trader Joe's meringue cookies (not baking a huge one for two people) then whipped some heavy whipping cream. I used our medium drinking glasses. I started with the slushy juicy berries, then add the cookies (cut in 1/2), then the whipping cream. Keep layering. Last fresh plain berries on top, added a cookie on top. That's it! I loved it!!! RIP Rosie-Rosie was our wonderful Rhode Island Red hen that we had for about almost 10 years. She'd been through her trials and tribulations over the years. Several months ago she started limping really badly and had to use one of her wings on one side to be able to walk. She kept doing pretty well was eating, drinking and hanging out with the rest of the flock. I couldn't really tell what had happened. I did read chickens can have strokes, maybe that was it? I examined her but couldn't figure anything out. Over time she started eating less and less and resting more. I couldn't bring myself to euthanize her because I'd had her for so long. So I kept her comfortable. I made sure she always got treats 2xs a day, water, was clean and would take her from the nesting box at night where she slept, down into the main part of the garden. Depending on the weather would be in, or out, of the coop. She enjoyed being with her pals. Finally last week I could tell she was ready to go. I brought her in, she sat next to me in a nice laundry basket on a big fluffy towel-It was nice and cool. She only lasted about an hour after I brought her in. She had a really good life, she ate lots of bugs and weeds and laid wonderful eggs. I like to think that she's on the other side now with her chicken friends who preceded her. We'll miss you Rosie! She was a real trooper and the mother/protector of her flock. She had quite the personality! RIP my sweet girl. Last summer with her flock-"},

I also came down with a non-C virus a week ago +, almost gone. Nothing like being sick in the summer, yuck. I browse around online and I think I've gotten to the point of not really being interested in blogs that show all these fun arts and crafts ideas, etc. On a certain level I think that there are just so many people who are still so asleep. While I appreciate the stress reduction aspect I'd rather spend money on food, fuel and OTC supplies to stash than craft items. But that's me. As I've said before- no downside to being prepared. Anyway, on Memorial day it was 45 degrees! Yes 45 degrees.  Heavy cold rains for 3 days, we were supposed to plant the veggie garden that weekend. This weekend it was pretty warm yesterday, so Dave turned the entire vegetable garden. Last fall I told Dave I wanted to expand the veggie garden so we can plant more intensively. I had the idea to cordon off a small portion of the veggie garden area and increase the length of the chicken run in the shade. We expanded the chicken run this spring which works great. I suggested that he create a gate out of the old coop wood door-We had replaced it with a used glass storm door. He came up with the idea to also have it articulated, so that will fold up for the winter, will get some touch up paint-Gate attached to coop, then chicken wire to the fenceGate attached to coopThe hens can get in and out of the coop, then also have the long shade run. We can plant much more intensively now, no worries for the hens digging into the veggies. Once the fall garden is done the idea of the chickens will have full use of the whole area again. We have so many eggs now I have decided to start dehydrating some. I'm ordered some trays for my dehydrator with lips for wet items. More later on that. Will be nice to have more room in the fridge! We woke up to heavy rains again today, Sunday. Dave decided to just go ahead and plant since his work week is crazy. He does the heavy digging as it's a lot easier on my arthritic knees and back. I will plant my smaller flowers and herbs, etc. He was out with wet clay soil today. He planted the 6 tomatoes, 3 peppers, a Bird's Nest pine and a yellow squash. Will plant the strawberries and others in the next week or so. Needs to dry out a bit - I wouldn't mind a cool summer, this this is crazy! We're supposed to get almost-record rain today that we would usually get in the entire month of June! What can you do? We'll get some more veggies planted in the next few weeks, will be a late growing season, fingers crossed. Fruit trees are LOADED too, great news!!! From Instagram.com Country LifeMy Favorite Youtubers-I thought I'd share some info on vloggers I have followed for quite some time, and have found to have very useful info. Many of them were way ahead of the curve news-wise. I was watching a really great YouTube video last night. This is the channel I don't usually watch, but I heard something about a message from a farmer it peaked my interest. This video really nails it in my opinion, and that's only my opinion, watch through the end-Points- Some people seem to think that if there is not a shortage in a grocery store now that that will continue. Farmers & ranchers plan out a year + in advance. The farmer that was quoted mentioned when you grow a calf to an adult for beef it takes about 18 months. So if you like beef you may be able to find in the store now, that's last year's production. Many didn't breed for this year, too expensive with feed prices. Many are cutting their herd size. I have heard this from many other sources as well. Buy now if you can. I also like these guys, pretty a-political and informative-  Canadian Prepper  Alaska Prepper  City Prepping and my fave female blogger Appalachia's Homestead with Patara, she is pretty blunt, so skip if you don't like that!

{"title": "Independence Days Challenge", "date": "May 15, 2022", "text": "Independence Days Challenge-Here's a look at some of the things that we have been up to. With our crazy weather we've had to put some plantings on hold but are getting started. I had a nice Mother's Day with two of my girls. One's living in Oregon now, and she sent me the most touching hand written letter about what my being her Mom meant. So lovely. I got a gift card from one of my other daughters which I always use every Mother's day to buy flowers and herbs locally. It's really nice to have our grandchildren in the area too, got to see them!New Arbor Vitae1. Plant Something-We had to replace one of our Arbor Vitae plants that we planted last year in our mound garden. We found a good deal last weekend but decided to leave it in the garage for protection with the crazy snow weather. I did buy a few herbs for my herb box, some perennials and Nasturtiums. I bought a bird's nest Pine shrub for my herb garden area which looks pretty sad most of the year-I'll be starting some calendulas from seed. With my job change and everything I just didn't have a chance to start some seedlings inside in our mini indoor greenhouse. The good news is all of the local nurseries seem pretty well stocked so far and the prices seem very reasonable. I will start some vegetables from seed out in the garden soon. Mostly I usually buy tomato starts for the garden, it's ready to plant-We extended the chicken run this spring, so we can plant the veggies more intensively. It's nice and shady in the summer, once we finish the fall garden we will open the main garden back up to them. I made this decision last fall, after seeing where things were headed. They will be limited to the south part of the garden and the run. During SUPERVISED visits I will let them into the veggie area. This should increase our production by 30 % or thereabouts. 2. Harvest Something-Still getting lots of eggs and have been harvesting some of the wintered-over kale and collard greens, mostly to the chickens so far. I bought some more collard greens and we'll tear out the old one since they're really going to seed. Will probably buy, or start, some kale as well and give those old ones to the hens. 3. Preserve/Store Something-Been buying random things to freeze and put in the pantry closet. I got some two-for-one ice cream yesterday and had a coupon for another one's so into the freezer it went. While I have to take it easy with dairy I can have a little ice cream once in awhile and doesn't seem to bother my stomach. I'm keeping up with having lots of flour stored as well as wheat berries. I had bought some Bob's Red Mill flour which comes in kind of a heavy plastic bag. After seeing some things about food storage I decided it would be best to actually put it in a vacuum sealed bag just to make sure it was absolutely airtight. Into the freezer it went. I don't freeze all my extra flour, I do have some in food grade storage totes. I was able to buy a couple of 2 gallon food storage totes yesterday with lids. I move some of my vacuum-sealed flour into those so they can be stacked.4. Manage Reserves- Get a Good Deal/Barter/Stock Up/Prep-I found a great deal on butter today so I bought two extra pounds to freeze, spray oil for baking, Dutch cocoa powder, and powdered sugar. We bought extra cat food for Bonnie, crackers and salad dressings. Just filling in all the reserves. I've been seeing a lot more caning supplies in the stores!!! Good news for us who can our own foods! Bought tow new sets of sheets, our were shot. I got some nice percale ones on sale, queen size $25.00, score! Got a nice LL Bean blouse on eBay cheap, like new. 5. Eat the Food- Try New Foods/Recipe-About every two or three weeks I hard boil a dozen eggs and work on them through the week for lunches. Sometimes they eat them playing with salt or make deviled eggs with spicy brown mustard. Yummy! I roasted some chicken from the freezer and we had a Greek chicken salad, with feta cheese, greens, Kalamata olives and some Kalamata olive bread. I thought out some huge country style spare ribs and will make those tonight for dinner barbecued. 6. Build Community Food Systems-We're going to the farmers market soon,  they should have some spring veggies in although the weather has been crazy. I heard the diesel prices are going to get really awful, also in a short supply in some areas of the country. Please support your local farmers and ranchers! It's going to be a tough year for them. Ditto feed prices. Bonnie photo bombed!7. Recycle/Re-Use-I wanted to spruce up my kitchen computer chair. I stumbled onto these covers for desk chairs on Amazon. It's a nice fabric lots of designs, and you just pull the two pieces onto your chair and viola! $10.00. I decided to go with the blue for a pop of color since I have some blue accents in the kitchen. At some point (before we bought the house 16 years ago) someone put a desk in the dining room and we actually really like it there. We thought about it moving the computer area to the spare bedroom but I like that it is centrally located. I'm hoping to replace the desk with a slab of butcher block for something different and do some different storage underneath. I decided to sell my bicycle that I hadn't ridden for a few years on Craigslist possibly. It's in really good shape but it's just not comfortable for my back. I donated some clothes and got rid of old office stuff we didn't need. 8. Skill Up-Learning lots of new software at my new job. Also learning more about the types of procedures we do and what they entail. Everybody's been really helpful at work so far. It's a nice relaxed environment so far! Great change for me. 9. Regenerate What is Lost/Salvage Something-A lot of people who work in cubicles (like I do now)  personalize them. I'm lucky that mine is V shaped and pretty open-I was looking for something fun to do under my big metal overhead cabinet and found this cubicle re-do on Pinterest, loved it, check out the photos on the link! from Farmhouse CubicleI wanted to bring nature in and decided to go with the white shiplap look after seeing that re-do. I can swap out some seasonal things as needed. I started with some white shiplap contact type sticky paper (removable)-will rotate so the lines go horizontallyI then bought this-Fun, 7\" wide from Amazon $7.00I saw a poster I really liked, took the idea and made my version, in a Word doc-I'm going to do a color print and hang in my cubicle! I already have some other farm style things, so I'm spending very little on this. I may have Dave make something fun out of scrap wood. I already have this- Here' my idea so far-I will post photos once I'm done. I think the white with rusty silver and green plants will pop, and then can rotate in some seasonal fun things too. May add a plant on top of the storage cabinet?"},

Yesterday morning it was 29 degrees and snowed quite a bit! The last time it snowed this much in Boise was in the 1890s! Because the weather has been so bizarre lately I'd been holding off on planting outside which was probably good. Typically around Mother's Day it's warm enough during the days to put out hanging baskets and annuals. Not so much this month. Heading into next week we're supposed to hit the mid-70s! It's been a real roller coaster. Waking up to snowMore info here-From Ktvb.com"},
{"title": "Full Swing Spring! New Job", "date": "May 5, 2022", "text": "Full Swing Spring!We had some cool weather, but it's been definitely spring in the daytime! We had some 60s/ 70s, then back to the 50's with heavy rain, 30's at night. Almost time to take off the comforter and put on the quilts and blankets. It's a ritual every Spring. We have such a heavy thick winter comforter that we start cooking when the weather is milder. Everything is really coming up in green and it's just gorgeous! Our curved garden we added last year came through the winter really well with a minor loss of plants. Dave touched up the bar dust a little bit and it looks great! space for a replacement shrubInteresting garden visitor, a Tippler PigeonI did some research and found out our feathered visitor is a racing pigeon, more here Pigeonpedia.com  I will see if I can get it used to me to see if I can find the owner by the band #.  The chickens for laying 2-4 eggs a day and are in full swing. Ironically with egg prices skyrocketing I actually don't know how much they cost in the stores? I know our feed has gone way way up and I'm hearing information from the NW and the South feed prices may double soon, if they haven't already. That will not bode well for farmers. Not enough corn for Ethanol either according to hubby's co-worker. We have a little extra feed stockpiled and I do have some ideas if things get really bad as far as how to feed the hens over the winter, etc. Anybody else seeing skyrocketing feed prices or other animal supplies? Cat food seems to be staying pretty level it's up a little bit but not too much.New Job-It took me awhile to get there, but I decided to quit my job last month. The job I started with was customer service, but since the first of the year it morphed into a high-volume call center environment. It  was not my background, and adding of more and more stats was confusing. I reached a point where it's just really wasn't worth the stress, especially given the current job market. Since I have a great skill set I applied for a job with a large private practice and got hired! Happy dance. I'll still be working in the medical auth biz but it has been more of a quiet work environment. Listening to phones ringing off the hook all day is not my thing. I may be doing more of a hybrid kind of job, working from home two weeks/office two weeks.  It's flexible. My previous employers tried to talk me into staying by offering me more money, but when I mentioned moving into a different position they had no response. That confirmed my decision. When you're already short-staffed the last thing you want to do is squeeze your existing staff harder and harder. It was time to go. I LOVE my new job and staff so far. Really great group. Biggest work space so far, time to decorate!"},
{"title": "From 75 To Snow! Limit 4 Per Customer/Meat Restrictions ", "date": "Apr 13, 2022", "text": "From 75 To Snow!April has been a wild ride! It's 75 degrees last week and woke up to snow Sunday morning. Next it poured rain, then three more rounds of snow.  We got much-needed snow up in the mountains as it has been dry the last couple months. A local ski resort will re-open this Saturday, with 18\" of fresh snow on Bogus Basin ski area. Being in high desert we really rely on the snow up in the mountains for water. We are into a mega-drought, a fact of life with water issues.  Our bulbs have come up. My kale and collard greens I wintered over have almost doubled in size with the warmer weather (before the snow). The chickens are doing well in their coop and we extended their run so we can plant more intensively in the veggie garden. Our construction on our street is coming along slowly but steadily. Once that's done we will be replanting part of the front yard. All our fruit trees have blossoms, will be plating seeds inside soon. Summer is around the corner!Ducks friends are back daily!Limit 4 Per Customer/Meat Restrictions-This week was the first time I had seen a sign limiting meat purchases. I had heard about this from other people in different parts of the country. First time I saw this was Sunday at the WinCo grocery store. There was a big sign for all their packages of chicken that said limit four per customer. I've heard about the culling of huge amounts of chickens due to the avian flu. If you want chicken and eggs I would definitely advise to buy some now while they're still relatively available. If you can, better yet, start your own chicken coop! We love our fresh eggs and while we choose not to harvest our hens there are some people that do that. Anything you can do to be more resilient right now it's a good thing! You can buy more beans and other protein sources. We have French Baked eggs for dinner sometimes. Cheaper than meat and has all the amino acids. Bon Appetit!"},
{"title": "The Giant Tree Trim! Success Wintering Over Veggies w/Row Covers,  Seafood Lowland Boil Recipe, Mason Brand = Pur Brand", "date": "Mar 29, 2022", "text": "The Giant Tree Trim!Spring is here! While I have been feeling the blogger blahs, I am ready to start planting seeds! We'll set up our seed starter stand and get things going under the grow lights. Last fall we decided to get more sun on our backyard vegetable garden area. I could see the writing on the wall with potential food shortages and other issues at that time. We have a huge maple tree that we absolutely love! Gives us tons of much-needed shade on the hot west side of the house. One of the challenges though has been getting enough sun over the garden. Quite a few years ago we used a really great tree service (Wolff) and they trimmed the south side of the tree enough to open up the garden and keep the tree healthy. Tree preservation here is key. They've also done some other trimmings of the tree, taking down some dangerous huge branches. We called them again this winter and got a bid on thinning the south side  again. I had them leave enough branches, however, over the coop to give the hens some shade. Our huge tree you can see from the front yard-I left the chickens in the coop in the early morning with snacks. I went over with the tree crew to try to keep the chicken's sunroom intact. They did a great job! Sometimes you have to make these tough decisions for food production. We also had them trim back our apple tree in the front, so that we can reach it for better harvesting. When a fruit tree gets too tall it gets to be impossible to harvest the fruit at the top. We had them trim it a few years ago and this year just had them shorten the top a bit. Problem solved. Tree over the coop, left some for shadeMuch more sun on the right! Tree all trimmed! Success Wintering Over Veggies w/Row Covers-In the photo above you can see the white row covers covering some of our winter veggies. Usually in the fall I have always ripped out our collard greens, etc. and gave them to the chickens. This year I decided to cover them with row cover and see if they would survive the winter or not. They are collard greens and kale. I cover them really well with a double layer of  row cover and secured them with some heavy rocks. Other than that I didn't really do anything else. Dave and I uncovered them a few days ago and they look great! If some of the leaves are bitter we can give them to the chickens for feed otherwise we will be eating them. Row cover is so cheap here, about $10 for a long packaged piece it's worth the investment. Just another way to increase food production! I expect they will really take off with the warmer weather now with some water and a little bit of manure.Seafood Lowland Boil Recipe-Last week I saw an old PBS episode of Emeril the Chef, and it reminded me of an old recipe I used to do. Years ago I saw some travel show where they did a lowland boil. It's traditionally done with a spicy broth with crawfish, beer, vegetables and sausage. One of the secrets was putting in a can of beer. Old Bay Seasoning is used, easily found at all grocery stores. I used this recipe as a base McCormick.com   To do it economically I bought a bag of frozen seafood mix. It has shrimp, scallops, squid, and muscles. I bought an extra bag of medium-sized frozen shrimp. I went ahead and bought some fresh Old Bay seasoning. I followed the basic recipe here but cut it in half. I also eliminated the sausage, trying to be a little bit healthier. I did about 2 to 3 quarts of water with almost a half a container of Old Bay seasoning, onions quartered, Yukon Gold potatoes chopped, six large chopped carrots. At add one can of plain beer, don't use a lager or anything dark! Adjust water as needed. After the vegetables were fairly well cooked through I added the seafood for about 15 to 20 minutes. I served this with cornbread and it was great! Keep well in the fridge. Mason Brand = Pur Brand-Last year I noticed Pur brand lids showed up in stores. Now I'm seeing jars with both brands listed. Looks like a merger or something similar. Luckily I am seeing canning lids in grocery stores! Nice to be able to stock up."},
{"title": "Preparedness 21.0, Crazy Spring Weather, Happy St. Patrick's Day! ", "date": "Mar 17, 2022", "text": "Photo from Wheat Rises to14 Year HighPreparedness 21.0/ Wheat Shortages-If you've been watching the news you may have started seeing some pretty major shortages of wheat (and other grains) coming up. Fertilizer for farmers too. If you stop to think about how many products are made of wheat it gets pretty mind-boggling. It's not just bread/baked goods but things like pasta, cooking grains, etc. I decided to buy some extra wheat berries while the price was still pretty low and I encourage you to do the same. Manual grinders are not that expensive to grind your own flour and you can also grind other grains.  I should add that you can also freeze flour, if you see a good deal (and have freezer space) put in a well sealed plastic bag to keep the moisture out. You can use a vacuum sealer bags too and freeze for longer storage. I think right getting more prepared is really really urgent. I don't want to be gloom and doom, but the flip side is I don't want to be just another blog about arts & crafts saying how wonderful things are. I have some co-workers who were really concerned about being able to afford gas to get to their jobs. There's also massive droughts, predictions of more on the horizon and the climate issues will affect this as well. There are so many pieces of this puzzle that I've lost a little bit of sleep over it, but I'm getting past that now. Just do whatever you can NOW, buy extra canned goods, fuel, water filters and plant some food that you can eat. And don't let other people dissuade you from doing this because they will be the ones asking you later for help. Stand firm. Read this-  UN Says Food Prices Jump to Hit Record High in Feb  Walmart has recently put limits on how may items you can buy, with the registers stopping when you check out. I really think it's good to get news from various sources, and expand your knowledge base. My Nebraska grandparents and family during the depressionI think about what my grandparents in the depression, how they survived in a rural area being pretty self-sufficient, but also community sufficient. It does rather boggle the mind that a couple of generations from the 1930's that there are people who think that cooking is sticking something in a microwave. The good news on the flip side was the whole movement of people who started baking bread during lockdowns. People also planted gardens and tried things, hopefully that will not fade. I hope everyone is doing well out there and situated. Things going on here, and in other parts of the world, maybe much worse than being portrayed. Time will tell. Crazy Spring Weather-We've gone from the twenties to the sixties and back again, sometimes I feel like I have whiplash! But the great news is the grass is starting to green up, flowers have come up, like our crocuses. Nice to have some days where it's actually warmer and we can open the windows! We had some much-needed rain with more on the way this weekend. Truly great in the high desert to get any kind of rain especially in the springtime, help sings green up.Happy St. Patrick's Day!We celebrated early, as I love corned beef and veggies! I wasn't going to buy any beef, then found a great deal on corned beef at Costco. I simmered it for hours and made an apple pie for dessert-cabbage and carrottsThe apples came from our tree last fall, just thawed. I made a \"Stephenson's Kansas City \" apple pie, just add the juice of one orange and 1 tsp. lemon zest to a standard recipe, delish! Trader Joe's also has amazing Irish Soda bread this time of year. Has raisins, buttermilk and caraway seeds. I bought a couple extra loaves to freeze. It tender and most, great for a snack and you can toast as well."},
{"title": "Increasing Food Production/Garden Project for Resiliency", "date": "Mar 2, 2022", "text": "Increasing Food Production/Garden Project for Resiliency-I found over the years that gardening is definitely a learning experience. With spring around the corner, and some temperatures in the 60's, we're looking ahead. Last fall I started thinking with the state of the world. I felt we really needed to increase our food production on our Little Homestead. Because we have a really large maple tree in our backyard we have very limited sunlight. When we first bought the house we laid out the back yard garden logically because that's where the sun was. Later we put up the coop which fit in that area well-Sunroom will come down next monthLast fall I was looking critically at how, and why, we use the space we have. I love having the chickens in the garden because they pull the weeds and eat the bugs, but you do have to protect your plants. Protecting the plants eats up space and requires monitoring-lots of useable space!more protectionI finally came to the conclusion what we needed to do was extend the run that goes along our fence line further down about another eight or ten feet-current run in the shade areaDuring planting season we will cut off the coop access to the main garden. We will close the main door and they can use the sunroom entrance. We can plant more intensively and the chickens would have a larger run to hang out in. I can do some supervised free-ranging in the garden. Late in the fall when we put the garden to bed we can open up that area again to the chickens. They will have lots of space over the winter and into spring. We need to feed ourselves more as a priority. Dave and I went out in the fall and bought another set of panels to match the existing ones we added last year-With the matching panels it will look nice and fit in with the landscaping. Here's the extension area we will use-you can see the arrowsThis will create a longer run in a dead space, the hens can rototill the area, has more nice shade in the summer and the rest of the garden will be more protected. All in all I think it's a good compromise! We will also have the south side of our maple tree trimmed back soon. It's expensive but you need a pro with a huge bucket truck-Tree hanging over gardenThe trimming will remove some of the branches to open up more light, but still give shade to the coop. I will schedule when I'm home to supervise. Looking forward to gardening season!!!!"},

If you want more information I do highly recommend the Canadian Prepper on Youtube, as he does a really good job with a-political world news and other topics. This war may be a game changer on an international level. I can't stress enough if you haven't started prepping now better that are late than neverGo out and buy canned/ dried foods, fuel, batteries, water, whatever you can afford and start a pantry.  Also have extra cash and coins stashed in case of Cyber attack and ATMs go down . Also get seeds to grow some of your own food, anything you can to be a little bit more self-sufficient if it all possible. If you're thinking about going shopping for new fun stuff put food on the list first. It's amazing how many bags of dried beans/rice, etc. you can buy for pretty low costs even now. Prices are really skyrocketing,  I'm seeing other bloggers seeing some major shortages in large grocery stores chains. This is only going to get much worse in my opinion. Best to do what you can now before things get even worse. And take care of yourself! I recently went to the dentist and got my regular cleaning done. I'm following up with my regular doctor on miscellaneous non-urgent stuff. Get OTC meds, buy anything you can, make a plan. There's no downside to preparedness. Thrifting/Costco Scores!It was 15 degrees this morning, not spring yet that's for sure. We'll start indoor seeds soon for the veggie garden. We'll have our huge maple tree trimmed and add on to our garden space soon, more news to come on that! Last weekend I finally hit a thrift store. I haven't been hitting them much last several months for a variety of reasons. I stopped at a local store, walked in and found two really great like-new items. The French Country vase with gorgeous pale cream, white and green flowers. I love the bee design, and only $4.00. Next I found this large resin chicken with a shovel! For $5.00 it will go on the deck when it warms up, both items were like-new! Next we went to Costco to stock up on a few things. I was really happy to see the their canned pulled pork back in stock! Multiple big cans, less the $10..00. I found a huge jar of mixed olives which we love! Somebody else had this on their blog, sorry, I don't remember who. Much cheaper than \"olive bars\", and a nice mix. I got two jars, they will last almost indefinitely in the fridge once opened, I consider this a \"comfort food\"- We also stocked up on some of our miscellaneous things that we use, like like cat litter. We bought two totes this time, since we've got two cats right now! We also got a huge bag of cat food. When we went to Winco I had noticed they really had a lot of their large preparedness foods out. A LOT there. They used to have a certain amount of large bags of foods like rolled oats, rice, beans. We bought some more black beans, and a few other things. Now they're also selling large 10 lb boxes of granolas, made in Canada, in bulk boxes. All whole grains, very little ingredients. We bought one box. We opened up the 10 lb box which was lined with a big plastic bag and the granola was amazingly fresh! We split them up in large canning jars to keep fresh-Almond honey granolaI noticed they had a fairly decent supply of canning jars in stock, but absolutely zero lids.  Glad I stocked up on some last year. I'm hoping to see some back of the store is at some point.  A little spring in the entry way-"},
{"title": "Preparedness 20.0/ Independence Days Challenge, Orwell's Truth, New Furry Member of The Family", "date": "Feb 13, 2022", "text": "Preparedness 20.0/ Independence Days Challenge-We woke up to 21° this morning! The ground is still frozen pretty hard. We had a few really warm days and all the snow is gone in the yard finally. It's going to be in the 50's this week. Spring is around the corner! I was feeling bad for the chickens yesterday that the ground is too hard for them to dig through. There was an incident Friday were one of our very passive hens started attacting two of the others. Very vicious, never saw anything like that. After doing some research I saw that boredom can be one of the causes of this. I started thinking that the ground was frozen so long they didn't really have a lot of digging to get into. Luckily Dave was able to turn some of the garden soil to give them something to go through. So far everything is calm again. I also realized that with the construction Friday, noise and vibration right in front of our house, it may have caused her to really stress. So here's what we've been up to-  1. Plant Something-Too early for outdoors! Will be starting seeds soon indoors in our grow light rack. Just ordered some fave tomato seeds, lots of other from last year. Will start veggies, herbs and flowers.  2. Harvest Something-Lots of eggs, that means more bread pudding in the future! Herbs in the yard are frozen. 3. Preserve/Store Something-Working on replenishing the freezers. We did an inventory of both freezers this weekend. Nice to have it all written down.   4. Manage Reserves- Get a Good Deal/Barter/Stock Up/Prep-What I bought this week: chicken quarters, $1.30 lb. decent price, organic grape jam clearance, organic flour, ditto some organic cereals, herbal supplements. I finally found some Ricola sore throat/cough drops (family size) bought four bags, bulk herbs, sneakers for both of us. I'm watching sales/discounts closely. Please stock up now, if you're not already! There are rumblings of an American trucker convoy. If so there will be even more disruptions to the supply chain!  Buy what you can where you can, think ethnic stores, outlets, bulk grocery stores, etc. Get used to thinking outside the box as far as what you're used to eating, versus what you may be able to find. Get creative, and barter, etc.   5. Eat the Food- Try New Foods/Recipe-Made French style Baked Eggs. Have lots of home frozen homegrown peaches/apples. Will start making some cobblers. Will work on more frozen meats, but keeping some in reserve.  6. Build Community Food Systems-Not this year so far, need to wit until spring for farmer's markets.  7. Recycle/Re-Use-Dave pulled part of our front fence out, as road construction has started here. They're finally adding sidewalks to the whole street! Afterwards we can install the panel again-Extra panel under treeMade more donations, clothing and household items. Found a fun wooden holiday item, $3.00 at a thrift store today and a small snow man lamp-8. Skill Up-Had to update my tax withholdings. After I changed jobs I didn't realize the 2019 tax code changed, and didn't have enough withheld, ouch. Luckily can change for this year.  9. Regenerate What is Lost/Salvage Something-I asked Dave several times to add another shelf to our little cabinet-He had a spare stair riser and worked perfect! Free upgrade!!! Easy to see what's in there and relocated some stuff-Bonnie's scratching post/perch needed some love, the lower carpet on the post was shot. We removed and I hot glued new sisal to the bottom and rubbed on some catnip. She loves it!Orwell's Truth-I read 1984 so long ago I don't remember when. George Orwell's novel, which I highly recommend, is one of the world's most famous books. 1984 is like a deep dive into the psychology of power and how the ways that manipulations of language/history/the press can be used as tools of control. I was reading some of his quotes recently these, really grabbed me-Freedom is the right to tell people what they do not want to hearSometimes the first duty of intelligent men is the restatement of the obviousThe most effective way to destroy people is to deny and obliterate their own understanding of their historyWe know that no one ever seizes power with the intention of relinquishing itGood ideas.... New Furry Member of  Family-Recently one of our daughters move to another state. Because it was during a really bad snowstorm we suggested that she leave her cat here with us. It was a good move as she drove thru one of the worst snow storms we've had in quite a while. We knew that there would be a little bit of hissing involved with our new furry friend getting used to Anya our Empress of the house. Anya is a super mellow cat, 11 years old and really curious. Our new furry friend Bonnie had been through some jostling around with the move. Luckily we had her kitty scratching post perch in the spare bedroom for the first week with cat box, food and water. We let her out when we were home, to supervise, to make sure the cats along okay. It took a little bit of time but now both cats are really enjoying each other's company, chasing each other up and down the hall. It's great for Anya because she's older and now she's more active! Bonnie has a really sweet disposition, very affectionate and likes to be held. Anya is more likes to lay on a blanket on your lap, but not a lap cat really. I think that was from her former owners. We will be keeping her for a few more months until our daughter can pick her up, but depending on how things go she may wind up staying here permanently. She's really enjoying the house and loves looking out the windows and watching the birds! She's been a great addition to our furry and feathered family. Her cat post needed some work and so I decided to fix it with some sisal that I had left over from a project. The bottom part of the carpeting was pretty well torn up so I removed it, and replace it with some fresh sisal with lots of lots of hot glue. Looks great!"},

Cold and clear, nice change from the inversion in the valley. Cold dirty air for the last two weeks on and off, yuck. Luckily we had a little bit of wind blow through. I got a yucky bug but I'm feeling much better. I woke up on a Wednesday in the middle of the night with the worst sore throat of my life. I called in sick the next day and felt really terrible, luckily I had lots of things on hand! I've always kept a good supply of homeopathic remedies oh, cough drops, pain meds Tylenol, etcetera. I still felt pretty icky the next day so I went to my doctor's office and got a strep test and the C Test both of which were negative. My doctor was checking my ears he said- oh you have an ear infection, then checked the other ear- oh this ear is infected too! He sent me home with a prescription for antibiotics which I dropped off at the pharmacy. I felt pretty lousy and Dave was out of town that weekend unfortunately. I thought I'd pick the RX up the next morning, but decided to go back that evening and pick them up. I called the pharmacy and it turned out instead of being open for 24 hours they had closed at 8 p.m. recording said \"due to a severe staffing shortage\". Bummer for me. I picked up my horse pills the next day and got started. Luckily I was off that Saturday, Sunday and Monday. That gave me three more full days to just stay home and rest. The interesting thing about shortages was this-  in the last week and a half I have gone to three different pharmacies and two grocery stores, (different chains), they were completely sold out of every single cough drop on the market, shocker. I know it's cold and flu season, but you never think something simple like cough drops is going to run out. I was able to find a few small bags of Ricola, my favorite brand, and grab those. Sadly I may have to resort to actually buying some off of Amazon, which is pretty funny on a certain level. You always think of something minor like cough drops as being readily available. Just a good reminder that we're not in Kansas anymore Toto. Make sure and buy what you need ahead of time and don't wait until you need it. Luckily I had plenty on hand for when I was actually sick, I was just trying to replenish my stock. I also had lots of chicken noodle soup on hand, soft foods, etc. It's easy to stash some cans of soup and other items, not very expensive and take up little space.Teaching Kids A Good Work Ethic-Dave and I were driving by his old employer's building today and it got me thinking. When our kids were about 10-13 my husband's boss was trying to get a small area weeded in their corporate yard. He couldn't really find a gardener that would tackle such a small project. There was basically a big weedy strip by their parking lot. I told Dave- why don't you tell him that I will come with our three kids if they will pay us and we will weed it. He asked his boss's boss said sure! Now it was summer and extremely hot, about 100 degrees. So we got there, took several hours, each of the kids made $10 an hour. They were hot and sweaty and filthy when we finished. We stopped and got ice cream on the way home, set up their little pool in the backyard, they all took a dip and cooled off. They also earned some money! Now it would be really easy to just not to have paid them, but I think working in blistering heat, doing a good job and getting paid was a really good lesson. All three of my adult girls have really great work ethic now. This is the kind of stuff people need to be teaching their kids instead of having them stuck in front of devices. If kids don't contribute to their family helping with chores, etc. as part of the group,  never may never have a chance to work for somebody else when young. Even a small one-time job they they can learn about the value of doing a good job for the sake of it, and also doing a good job for other people.white egg not in shotEggs, Eggs and More Eggs!Our eggs are back in production! We had only been getting about 1 egg per day for quite a while. One of our hens is a brown leghorn and she's the only one who lays white eggs. We haven't gotten an egg out of her for four months or so and all of a sudden we got a white egg. Since then the last couple days we've been getting three eggs per day! I'm so proud of my girls they made it through the winter and are  ramping up production. I celebrated by making my favorite chocolate bread pudding using a full 10 eggs! This is another reason why more and more people, given the current state of the economy and access to food, should really get chickens. As long as they're willing to take care of them appropriately and have the correct space it's a really great investment. And they pull weeds and eat bugs in the garden! Selling or bartering extra eggs is always nice to be able to do. Enjoy!"},
{"title": "Preparedness 18.0/Storage Containers, Instagram Deletes Gardening Info ", "date": "Jan 19, 2022", "text": "Preparedness 18.0/Storage Containers-Winter is still here! No more snow, but cold temps. We took down the Christmas decor last week. We still have up some winter decor, like these-kitchen windowcoffee table with new wood tray I boughtside tableSnowmen and winter fun will stay out for a few more weeks. So, here's some ideas that you might find useful! Onto the practical things in life............If you're just getting started with preparedness I thought I'd go over some easy, inexpensive/free ideas for storing foods and other items. Some people think you have to go out and buy a bunch of stuff to start a food pantry or food storage area. Pinterest is full of really gorgeous pantries that waste a lot of space and cost a lot of money to set up. From a practical standpoint you don't have to have a fancy-schmancy looking pantry to be prepared! Here's some ideas for some inexpensive/free storage containers you can use for getting more prepared. You can check out your local thrift store and yard sales for containers! Why buy new when you can get used, keep them out of the landfill and store your foods! Here's some ideas!!!Glass jars, see above. Almost everybody buys things that occasionally are in glass jars and they are perfect for recycling for storage! Just wash them make sure they're dry and fill with all kinds of things like beans, pasta, Etc. For some foods you can use O2 absorbers. Baskets, they're great, whether wicker, plastic, wire, or metal, all can be used to store lots of things- Extra 1st aid and supplements basketExtra medswire baskets with veggiesBins and boxes. Leftover cardboard boxes are great for storing things in especially if they're smaller. Canning jar boxes are great! You can not only store your empty canning jars but because but you can stack them easily. You can cut down the edges and customize and make it work in your space. Plastic bins and totes work well also-condimentspastasVacuum sealed bag. I have one of these machines and they work great! While I primarily use these for the freezer I do occasionally use them for dry goods like nuts. They're a little bit of an investment initially but I noticed that they have completely eliminated any freezer burn on meats and things. I have frozen some for up to a year with no damage.Plastic Ziploc bags. These come in handy if you have things that you want to store in a more flat way, like bags of chop nuts that you want to freeze. Put them in a ziploc bag, get out as much air as you can, roll them up, label and put in your freezer. Ditto to lay on the shelfs. Totes.  Like this leftover cat food one. I will clean, sanitize and line with food grade plastic, don't want our people food to smell like the cat's! Instagram Deletes Gardening Info -I know that social media is clamping down on things for a variety of reasons. I won't get into the motivations. I was reading an email from Melissa from Instagram Melissa K. Norris Modern Homesteading  The email/post was about how to grow one year's worth food for your family. I love her blog, Youtube channel, she's got lots of great info. I saw the post flip up on an email and on Instagram and I thought I'd to check it out. Later I went to find it and it was gone. A little later she posted that (Facebook-owned) Instagram, had actually deleted it, including in her archives. Needless to say I was pretty shocked, to think that growing food for your family would be some kind of subversive activity! This is a really great reminder about how much to trust social media. Freedom of speech is our first right for a reason. What could possibly offend somebody wanting to grow food for their family? Maybe it's not about offending somebody maybe it's about controlling information. Buyer beware. Here's a new link with great new info on her blog!  How to Plan A Medicinal Herb Garden"},

The temperature dropped and snow started, we woke up with about three/four new inches. Since the temperature stayed cold none of it melted. We got hit hard Tuesday/Wednesday about 4\" more, more Thursday, then stopped Friday.  We had a nice Italian lunch out for New Year's Eve and then stayed home. We had a nice evening watching Christmas movies. We packed up the Christmas tree (artificial due to allergies) New Year's day. I made a big pot of minestrone soup, with salad and bread for dinner. I used this recipe Olive Garden Minestrone Soup .  Nice and hot when it's 13 degrees out, under the deep cold front! Here's some shots of the snow and the holiday decor we still have up, will pack up next weekend-we feed the crittersCozy coop with sunroomSun room doing it's job! daughter's yard artwinter wonderlandHerb boxesIt did!Fresh greens in a vase from TargetDave gave me the barn for my birthday!Our treebackyard viewFlowers in time for New Year's!Little Homestead 2021 Year In Review!Here's our year in review, not in any particular order!Our biggest indoor home project was having our shower tile redone in our large bathroom Tile Upgrade We had done a total remodel quite a few years ago, but we had installed plastic panels for the shower due to time/ money constraints. We had always wanted to do some kind of nice ceramic tile. When we got our \"stimulus\" checks we decided to invest that money into the house. We did some pricing and I did a lot of research. I saw a couple homes that had really large tiles with light gray grout. We hired a local tile company and they did a great job! We wanted niches but the studs were in the wrong spot. We have absolutely loved it and is very, very low maintenance with the epoxy grout. We clean it once a week with vinegar/water spray and then we do the normal tub cleaning, etc. I feel like I'm in a spa when I get in! Floating stainless steel shelvesSome of our other stimulus money we used to invest in some other smaller things like insulated curtains, an oil-filled radiant space heater for my office, upgraded some other home items to keep it more energy efficient.Our garden did really well this year, but it took a while to get established due to the extreme high heat we had. We had quite a few weeks of a 100 degree weather and that stunted a lot of the growth. Once the weather moderated a bit we had a bumper crop of apples, pears, peaches, peppers, tomatoes-We had such a bumper crop we decided to invest in a second, smaller freezer that we have in my home office. That's worked out really well especially with doing more food storage for preparedness-I also used my dehydrator and vacuum bag sealer a lot this year, preserved a lot of different fruits and vegetables. Did lots of fermenting, more food production/preservation/storage in general. In the Spring I felt a real need to be more prepared and work on the pantry. Sadly what I feared came true with higher food prices, availability, supply chain issues, etc. No down side to being prepared! After years of being really frustrated with a job that I could not transfer out of I decided to quit my job. Bye Bye SLHS. My current job almost tripled my vacation, has amazing benefits and it's basically a nice group of people to work with. While it can be pretty boring I am looking at retirement at sometime hopefully in the not-too-distant future. I'm still doing research on that and time will tell. I plan on working part time, hopefully back in education, we'll see. We were gifted with our third grandchild, a girl, in August. I know a lot of people post a lot of photos, but I think that it's good to have some kind of privacy from social media. Her name is Ripley, named after Ripley from the Aliens movie franchise. She's very happy baby, a real sweetheart and was born with lots of red hair! It's kind of fun having a granddaughter after having two grandsons. The grandsons are doing well and five years old. We're really lucky that we can see our grandchildren living in the area.Chickens are doing really well, had a real bumper crop of eggs and so I froze a lot of them. We had a bee swarm, nicely relocated! We did a partial re-do on the coop  Coop Update and Garden Fencing  We had wanted to build a new one and relocate it, but lumber prices were just way way too high. Since we had some free scrap lumber Dave I suggested that he rebuild part of the floor, which he did. He also used some leftover bricks that we had to brick the floor where the dirt floor had been. There are two levels in the coop. The chickens were almost digging under the edge of the walls on the bottom level making it unstable. I suggested a new design on the sunroom for the winter. We were able to ditch the really heavy glass shower doors and use some flexible plastic tubing. It's a lot easier to set up and less weight and does a good job! We also added a used metal storm door, the old one was really warped-Major landscaping re-do was in the backyard and we had some duck visitors! Garden Rehab  I was really tired of having a ugly view from the kitchen/ dining room of the rotting cold frames. We had opened up another part of the garden for those veggies and I had seen a design that I really liked  Garden Re-hab Begins. We were able to use the dirt, mound it, curve it, and plant mixed sun/ shade plants and shrubs. Wood was rotted so we composted it. We also dug out the two ugly shrubs that were along the fence line and replaced them with Arborvitaes. We will have privacy from the backyard rental house and it really softens the fence. We did it on a budget and everything has grown in really, really well. We moved the huge bamboo on the left from another area. Only thing I forgot about was to plant spring bulbs, but will plant some other little flowers in the spring. It's grown in really well and we absolutely love it! We will have a tree pruner come in at some point and trim back our huge maple tree for more sun on the veggie garden.Our veggie garden fence was falling apart, so we bought new metal fence panels, quick install and should last a long time! Garden Rehab Phase 4We love the curves! We bought some extra panels this fall and will make the shade are for the hens longer and start keeping them out of the veggie garden. With preparedness, we need to grow more food. The city/county is going to be putting sidewalks through our street since we don't have them all the way. Basically they purchased three to four feet of our frontage on our lot. Construction will start this month. Will basically rip up our street/re-pave, widen the street and create curbs all the way. Good news- they will also fix part of our broken concrete driveway. Glad they are doing this, will be safer for the neighborhood. We decided to use this as an opportunity to re-do part of the front yard. Dave dug up the perennials we felt that we could salvage and planted them in another area of the yard. He also removed part of the picket fence, since they will tear it out. There's only a few plants left and they will go (sick or stunted). Then once it's completed in the spring we'll put the fence back, some of the perennials and add some new things. We're trying to really naturalize the front yard more. May add some edibles too. Went to Hood River, Oregon in the spring for Dave's brother's belated funeral. We stayed at the Columbia Gorge Hotel, great off season rates and gorgeous gardens in the spring-Got to see Mount Hood up close from Parkdale! Gorgeous!!! Wish we could live there. And lastly-From Target!  Struggle Meals Show-I ran across this show over the holidays, on our free Tastemade Channel's called Struggle Meals . The premise is low-cost, no-waste meals. Frankie Celenza is the host, a chef and he's a hoot! You can watch online for free. He was inspired to create healthy meals for people with not much $ with simple ingredients. I watched a show with a weekly budget with three meals a day, he was very creative, has some great ideas! He posts on Instragram and has some Youtube videos too, check him out!"},

Woke up to about 1/2\" of snow and 21 degrees this morning. We're talking lots of feet of snow in the mountains in the next week. This is our first really big snow storm to hit. I've seen there's more weather problems up in Canada and Washington, sad. We usually get snow November/December, but it varies every year. So far nothing big down here in the valley, but look at the forecast! Birthday Ikea Trip/ Holiday Decor Downsizing-It's that time of year! I started putting up our winter decor about a week ago since I like to take a break after Thanksgiving. I also had my birthday! I won't say which one, but a BIG one. I like doing something fun since I never had a birthday parties as a kid. I always got combination birthday and Christmas gifts, what a bummer. Dave and I did a one-day birthday drive to Salt Lake City Ikea so I could buy some holiday goodies for my birthday present. I did about 95% of the driving, perfect weather. I know it may seem crazy but I've wanted to buy some of their winter decor, and you can't buy it online. We never go to the Portland Ikea for family visits in winter. So we went! We never got a vacation this year or last year, so we didn't feel guilty. Just gas, a couple meals, and shopping. They were out of a few things but I got most of the fun holiday items-Finally a Dala horse! And a Tomten with deer (ceramic)Fox and tree candle holder, ceramic too I really wanted their 3-piece glass mushroom set, but were out. I found one on eBay for a bit more, I was thrilled! Three sizes, heavy glass with heavy clips- Red and white mushrooms were said to be the basis for Santa's hat! I added to my display, I love the nature look with the greenery-Bigger shot here-Also from eBay, an Ikea LED mini candelabra, battery operated, $10.00-I stocked up on their amazing whole grain/Rye crackers, cookies and a little Swedish cheese. Got a mistletoe table runner, some mini star lights and some stocking stuffers. I really love Scandinavian folk art and natural types of holiday decorations. So there's a sneak peek of what we have out. Our Christmas decor will be coming out this weekend! Dining room farm windowKitchen window, thrifted new prim snowmanDining roomLiving roomEntryway Gingerbread themeLiving room windowI moved my Jul decor to the living room this year! Holiday Decor Downsizing: Phase two was letting go of some winter  decor. I decided I wanted to get rid of at least one or two chunks. I always start off with putting winter decor out first. Then I add Christmas things a week or two later. First thing I did with the winter stuff was spread it out and open the totes which created quite the mess! Then I started going through things that I really love versus things that I was ready to let go of. Since a lot of my holiday decor was thrifted there wasn't a huge amount of financial investment. I looked at what do I really love, how much storage do we have, etc. I wound up emptying out one complete tote and donating all of it. Next phase will be going through all the Christmas stuff. The biggest part of that is our artificial tree, wrapping paper, ditto. The rest is tree decorations and tabletop things. Over time I'm liking something less cluttered looking, although my style might be more cluttered than other people's. That's okay. I think decorating for winter is my favorite thing because I've always loved snow! Probably from growing up in Southern California where I didn't really see any except way up in the Sierra mountains.Preparedness & RX Shortages-What's new here for preparedness. I have noticed some distinct shortages in the grocery stores and escalating prices. I saw some bell peppers for a $1.75 each, instant noodles ramen type of foods completely off of all the shelves. This was in a Walmart Market. I see our gas prices here are going down a bit which is good. I was happy to see the Walmart Market did have some canned Keystone meat on hand. I picked up a couple cans of chicken. Keystone meat comes really really highly recommended, it's affordable only meet in a lightly salted Brian no other flavors and big chunks. Still getting a few eggs here and they're usually about one a day, glad I had some frozen! When we were getting four per day in the summer I decided to start freezing them. I did also buy some sprouting seeds in case the quality and price of greens gets really exorbitant. I have noticed some quality issues with some things like romaine and spinach . Not sure if it's from the trucking shortage? I also found a nice deal on a bread proofing basket (Ikea) with a cloth cover-I also bought an Ikea knife sharpener, has a well for water to wet the sharpening stones-As for RX shortages- I'm hearing this from some of my medical employers insurance  members, more RX's are getting more backordered. This is a sobering list from Drugs.com Drug Shortages, what's scary is it's so long, and growing. Wondering how are you doing in your neck of the woods as far as availability of foods and products, prices? Our houseCoop's ready too!"},
{"title": "Independence Days Challenge/ Preparedness, Using A Kerosene Heater  ", "date": "Nov 29, 2021", "text": "Winter 2017Independence Days Challenge-We're ready for winter! It's been colder, in the 20's at night, but dry. The forecast is a wetter winter, so may be snowier than usual, time will tell. I put away the Autumn decor yesterday.  We had a pretty quiet Thanksgiving with just our daughter and her boyfriend coming over. Our one daughter went to her in-laws with her husband for turkey day. Our other daughter had a very sick grandchild and they decided to stay home. We're trying to break the cycle of having anybody over who's actively sick, we were on the same page with that. Still sad. We did send them over a whole bunch of hot food right before we sat down for Thanksgiving dinner, so they were covered! Consequently we have quite a bit of turkey left which is nice. Will probably be making some turkey noodle soup and turkey enchiladas. If we still have more leftovers it's going into the freezer.Will be putting out indoor winter decor and our Advent wreath with candles. Dave put up the front lights yesterday, since it was mild, not turned on yet though. I like a break between holidays, we did add this outside-Bring it on! I love snow...I have today off (Monday), since I currently work Tues. - Sat. It's \"open enrollment\" for the insurance company I work for, but only for a while longer. I decided to take tomorrow off, giving me a three day weekend. Taking Friday off too, for my birthday! Dave and I went to McCall for our anniversary for two nights a couple weeks ago. He's been working really long hours, so it was a much-needed break! Not much snow on the ground, nice weather. Sunset Alpenglow over Payette Lake-The next day- City park pretty empty, got snow the next week afterI found some fun thrifted items for our new granddaughter! She was born Aug 27th, with red hair! Fun to shop for a girl baby. The two grandsons are doing great too, very busy busy. It's nice we all live in the area and can see each other. Hoping everyone is healthy for Christmas!Watching the news about Canada's epic flooding, with more on the way, it's a sad reminder how important it is to prepare. Prices still going up here, shrinkflation with packaging, some of the local craft stores had shortages and empty spots. Grocery produce is going downhill quality-wise. Worker shortages in businesses. My own employer is having trouble hiring staff, maybe they'll raise the pay!!! So here's what we've been up to-    1. Plant Something- It's winter here, nope  2. Harvest Something- Eggs, chives, herbs. Herbs froze but are still hanging in there! 3. Preserve/Store Something- Freezing butter, cheese, baking supplies, chocolate (heck yes!) storing extra chicken feed/pine shavings for coop. Dave just cleaned it, ready for winter with extra thickness to keep the girls warm. I bought some cracked corn for the really cold days coming. We're only getting about one egg a day, glad I froze lots!!!  4. Manage Reserves- Get a Good Deal/Barter/Stock Up/Prep- Got a new phone, mine was Galaxy 8S Active, 2G and 5 years old. Free with a slight plan upgrade, temporary for 3 years. Nice phone, got  a Galaxy S21, lots more photo options, although I love my DSLR. Buying extra cereals, butter, pastas, peanut butter, c leaning supplies, shampoos, various food items when I see a good sale. Got some clearance artisanal breads to freeze. Got a new 2022 wall calendar, two Amaryllis bulbs, one is already blooming, from a big box store! Only $5.00, had the stem 5\" long when I took it out of the box! Added to my antique coffee pot, a gift from my cousin when I was young-Red and whiteDeep red blooms to comeDave bought a MONSTER poinsettia from Costco, I have NEVER seen one that big! Going on the top of the entertainment center soon-I also bought some more clearance priced seeds, .50 cents each.  More to store for next year, just in case. Bought more kerosene, in case we lose power. 5. Eat the Food- Try New Foods/Recipe- Just discovered a new Foodnetwork show on our anniversary trip (hotel had cable!) Girl Meets Farm , lots of unique fun recipes, especially the fried turkey breast! I may try that. I love her old farmhouse kitchen re-do, with Grandma's old range too! It's nice they actually film in a real kitchen, not a set somewhere- From Behind the Scenes Girl Meets Farm 6. Build Community Food Systems- Farmer's market closed. 7. Recycle/Re-Use- Roasted a medium sized decorative pumpkin for the hens, food time! Thrifted baby clothes, on sale/half off, got several outfits (new on the hanger) for .50 cents, WOW! Pumpkin for the girls8. Skill Up- Did some new research on using kerosene heaters and learning more about emergency heating. I really appreciate some of the Youtube vloggers out there- Alaska Prepper, Canadian Prepper, City Prepper, etc. I edit out the politics and look for things I can use. We don't have a wood stove, for instance, but can use lots of other ideas. Thinking outside the box in the main thing. 9. Regenerate What is Lost/Salvage Something- Bought some small cans of paint to touch-up the kitchen, main hallway and big bathroom, a few dings here and there! Using A Kerosene Heater-I have a couple of kerosene heaters, including some brooder heaters. These are for emergency use for us. I thought I'd share my experience with these. So before we get started...Here's my DISCLAIMER- Kerosene heaters burn oxygen in the air and release carbon monoxide. Kerosene heaters can also release other pollutants like sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide. To reduce the risk of asphyxiation due to carbon monoxide poisoning, you must vent the room being heated! Crack a window or door, always have a working carbon monoxide. Safety first, don't burn down your house. Never leave a kerosene heater unattended/when you are sleeping, keep the instruction manual nearby, use clear kerosene, store kerosene in containers clearly marked. Refilling should only be done outdoors and when the unit is cool, keep heater away from all flammable and combustible items (such as curtains, furniture, aerosol sprays, and gasoline). Do your own research. Thanks. The large one above is a Perfection M525, probably from the 70's, info here Millesstair Perfection History. I bought is for about $15.00 several years ago at a thrift store.  I have another large one, an Alladin, I need to get it down to fill. I had trouble lighting it before, then read you need to fill and let sit for an hour, dry wick otherwise. DUH! Anyway, I filled and fired up the small brooder heater first, bought at a estate sale years ago, unknown brand, $10.00, like new-Tips open to change wickOpen brass plug and fillNice, with the Mica windowI fill these up with WATER THE 1ST TIME, to check for leaks. Next, I filled these up outside, on the grass. Then snapped down the chimney. It got hot fast and you can adjust the wick as needed, very little odor and smoke! These were used to keep eggs and chicks warm in the coop, but an obvious fire hazard. You can find these on eBay on occasion. Now the Perfection, probably from the 1970's, in pristine condition! First you push a tab and open the top-Fount in baseSilver tab to open and snap shutopen, take fount outThe fount-Unplug and fill (outside) push plug back in, the cork floater will tell you if fuel is low-Put the fount back in, light wick, roll up as needed, snap top down-nice and toasty! I used this kerosene above, less smoke, recommended on many websites. This is an EXCELLENT website I have used, and bought wicks from, he really knows his stuff Milesstair.com Kero FuelRemember do YOUR OWN RESEARCH!!!"},

Winter is definitely here with a little bit of snow in the hills and mountains in a few days. I have been tracking the weather closely, so we already had all of our perennials fairly well mulched, and I put row cover over the kale and collard greens. Last year some of my collard greens wintered over with no cover but they were bigger. With the weeks and weeks of 100 degree weather this summer they got a slow start- under nice row coversThis weekend we will be taking all of the tools inside from my garden work bench on the back porch and storing them and then covering it up for the winter-bench on rightDave got the new sunroom design up on the coop, we'll be soon running a power line through for their water heater/ hard-wired in heat lamp if we need that. Gives them more dry/warm space-For preparedness for the chickens we bought several months worth of food in advance and pine shavings. Same thing with our cat as well, we have at least a month or two's worth of extra food on hand. You just never know what's going to run out anymore-Debbie left and Sunny rightLuna deep in thoughtI'm also going to stock up on some sewing items. I'm a little bit short on various needles. Being able to mend your clothes or a pair of things over time it's a good skill to have! I cannot tell you how many really great thrifted designer tops I have bought that were missing a button, while there was one sewed into the inseam. When somebody is not knowledgeable enough (or maybe rich), they don't sew a button on, they donate to shirt instead, shakes head.Part of preparedness for me is having the house ready for winter. We have the nice warm comforter on our bed now and we are lowering our heating temperatures during the day-Since I'm working from home I close my office door and turn the down the furnace. I have an oil-filled electric radiant heater that I turn on first thing in the morning, then turn on/off as needed in my work space. That way we were not heating the whole house! I added a little battery operated Ikea string lights to my pantry rack, cheers up the space. I'll add some Christmas and winter decor soon after Thanksgiving!On the preparedness front- as far as food I did notice a few anomalies here and there I went to our local WinCo last week to get some groceries. I noticed that there was actually zero beef lunch meat on the shelves, except for one brand. There was lots of turkey, chicken, ham, etc. but only one type of package of beef. Meat prices are definitely way way up so I'm glad we don't eat meat everyday. I did find some good deals on chicken breasts w/ribs for a $2.00 a pound which was not. I bought a four pack and roasted them with salt pepper garlic paprika and Sage. Roasted a couple of yams and it was a great dinner!I think a few things are good to think about stocking up on would be things like laundry detergent, or components to make your own. Soaps, shampoos, deodorant those kinds of personal hygiene products you might need. And for you females you know what you might need certain products as well! Recently bought some extra things like Q-tips. Got to have my Q-tips! I have been seeing a lot on social media about ever increasing prices of gas, food, etc. I've also heard that there are people who were raiding grocery stores. They go in a group and get lots and lots of full carts of food, run out of the store into a waiting truck, load it all and leave. That's pretty scary,  stealing $1,000.00's worth of food. I think using the phrase repeatedly supply chain issues may be an attempt to normalize that. It is not normal and it never will be. Sadly the weather comes into play with this, in British Columbia one of their ports was hit with massive rain storms and was shut down-From Canada Flood and LandslidesI just finished up my last dehydrating tomatoes batch! I have a few fresh ones on the counter that I'll be using to make some pasta sauce with sausage this weekend. Good time for hearty food!I have been watching some videos on YouTube of preparedness folks and one of them I actually stopped watching. She kept saying \"oh my husband's favorite meat and oh my daughter's favorite drink is out!\" I finally put something on her YouTube comments about being resilient! Maybe time to make some homemade flavored teas and time for husband to look at alternative protein sources? With things being the way they are (I don't see this changing anytime in the future) it is time to be resourceful, flexible, and resilient. No point being a victim through all of this, get creative!"},

", "date": "Nov 10, 2021", "text": "Preparedeness 16.0/ Grocery Recon-I went grocery shopping a few days ago at a store I haven't been in for quite a while. Started going to Winco in the spring with food prices going up, and they have a great bulk section! I was at my dentist's the other day right next to an Albertson's so decided to go in there for a few odd items. One of the things I'd read about was a potential pasta shortage coming up, due to grain prices. I was really shocked at the Barilla brand pasta that I have bought for years has almost doubled in price, and the box has shrunk about 35% at least. SHRINKFLATION. Luckily Albertson's had their store brand pasta and I was able to buy six boxes of pasta for $0.99 each. I love pasta in the winter! I did get a few of my other regular items at a slightly higher price. They did seem to be pretty well stocked. I must say our WinCo prices are definitely cheaper. I also stopped at a Ross discount store with clothing, etc. Their shoe section was 50% empty which was really a shock to see. They're bedding section which used to be several rows was now 1/3 of a row and mostly empty. I guess it makes sense that a lot of the discounted clothing from stores is not getting shipped around much. Not a shock, but the shortages are settling in. We have everything for Thanksgiving so I'm good to go! I'll be hosting our partial family, so we're ready!  Oakleaf Hydrangea, love the bronze tones! Autumn Colors and 27 Degrees! We had a real cold front come in last week and woke up to 27 degrees in the morning! Our autumn colors are really pretty right now, but will come to an end soon so I decided to take some photos. The day after this it was pouring rain. So here's some of our autumn colors at the little Homestead!Our little rainbow Zinnias I started from seed DelphiniumsRainbow EchinaceaRosesWe went to Hyatt Hidden Lakes Reserve early Sunday afternoon for a walk. It's a reserve that's not too far from our house. There were tons and tons of wildlife there, wish I would have taken my zoom lens! Lots of Canadian geese and various water fowl. Really nice oasis in the middle of town. We drove up to Bogus Basin after that, almost up to the mountaintop, but it was a solid sheet of ice, so we had to turn back. At least we got to see some mountain trees and snow! Here's some shots from the reserve-"},
{"title": "Preparedness 15.0 / Back By Popular Demand! Cranberry Orange Cream Scones", "date": "Nov 3, 2021", "text": "Preparedness 15.0 / Back By Popular Demand!After all the great comments I decided to keep on keeping on. Watching things I am still seeing more shortages and price hikes. I decided to buy a small beef roast for the weekend to roast and got major sticker shock. I went ahead and bought a smaller one, since there's only two of us, and just wanted some for a few meals. I used this basic recipe Bottom Round Roast but left out the broth and wine-Next time I will thaw one of mine out! I think the beef prices from the spring have almost doubled from what I can see. I made the roast with veggies, then made French dips the next night! Still spending time dehydrating tomatoes, almost down to the very end-I'm happy to have them but will be glad when that is done and I can put my dehydrator away. We have a reasonably small kitchen and not a lot of counter space. The kale and collard greens are holding on well since it's cool weather, will mulch them and see if I can winter them over. Last year my collard greens actually survived the winter without mulching. I just fed them to the chickens in the spring. This year I'm going to mulch them both and see what happens. I also have my Kohlrabi that never produced the little sputniks, so I will let them winter over also.As far as purchasing I'm just filling in a few more gaps here and there. I've been hearing with the grain shortage there may be a major pasta shortage in the not-too-distant future. Luckily pasta is still pretty cheap so I've been buying a few extras here and there, as well as extra flour when I see it on sale. I could always make homemade pasta if needed! Years ago I bought a used Perfection kerosene heater at a thrift store cheap. I'm going to fire it up this weekend since I've never used it. With fuel shoratges looming better to have it working and not need it-Kerosene is much safer than gas, etc. because it is so less flammable. Kerosene heaters made by Perfection company go way way back, they also made cookstoves. It is always important to have a carbon monoxide detector on hand if you're going to use them inside in the closed space and to crack windows so be warned! I would also never use one when I'm sleeping.I'm still buying more cat food and stockpiling some since Anya a sensitive stomach. It's easier to buy two little boxes at a time instead of one and stash it. It's nice when you can buy the cans in the small shallow box because they're easier to stack. I've decided to get back into baking now that the garden is winding down. Bread-making is on the horizon soon, I did go ahead and start with a new scone recipe. They were fabulous! Recipe below.Cranberry Orange Cream Scones-I used to always loved getting these scones from a certain coffee shop years ago (Starbuck's). Not too sweet and a little tart. Then the recipe changed, yuck, no whole cranberries, more like a jam filling. After buying some of Trader Joe's scones (which were nice) I read the label, way too much sugar! I decided to start making my own cran-orange scones. Scones are nice because you really can flavor them any way you want. I found this recipe The Yes Chef Kitchen, and the dough was a little dry, so I added more cream. I baked a batch and we loved them! Slightly crisp on the bottom and very tender and moist inside. I used frozen cranberries, that's the ticket! I think I would add more orange zest next time, since I love citrus. It's a keeper!"},
{"title": " Record-Breaking Storm/ Last Preparedness Post 14.0 UPDATED, Canning Tomatoes Vs Dehydrating", "date": "Oct 27, 2021", "text": "Record-Breaking Storm/ Last Preparedness Post 14.0-  ***UPDATED***If you've been watching the national news there was an \"atmospheric river\", a Cyclone-type rain storm that hit the West coast and the Pacific NW. We definitely got hit with lots of rain and some gusting winds. We had almost 3\" of rain in three days!!! While that's not record-setting that is a lot of rain in October! We haven't had any real damaging winds in Boise luckily. Supposedly there were much higher winds up in the mountains. Just glad we finally got some rain, as it was so dry! We have cooler temps coming next week, time to get out the comforter and add the sunroom to the coop. The sad part of the storm was it hit some areas with high winds, mudslides, power outages and road closures in parts of California. Info here Record Rain Storm California Excerpt- A rainfall record was shattered in Sacramento-Northeast of San Francisco, 5.44 inches (13.82 centimeters) fell on downtown Sacramento, shattering the one-day record for rainfall that had stood since 1880. Lake Oroville, a major Northern California reservoir, saw its water levels rise 20 feet (6.10 meters) over the past week, according to the state's Department of Water Resource. We got lots of notice ahead of time which was good-Good news for the fires and drought! More goods news here-Yosemite falls come back to lifeAutumn here-Time to stash the table/chairs, empty the pond! Some blue skies todayFall colorsLast Preparedness 14.0-  I decided this will be the last specific prep post for a variety of reasons. You're either getting prepped or not. There's plenty in my previous posts for those who are interested! I went to our local Natural Grocers store a few days ago and their section for oats was completely empty. An herbal supplement I've taken for a long time was out, they said they were having supply chain issues, not a surprise. I stocked up on a few more bags of wheat berries, Natural Grocers had 2 lbs for a $1.50.  Our Winco grocery store has been looking pretty good, as far as being stocked, but I have noticed some of their produce is looking pretty sad. Meat prices, especially beef, continue to go up. Two of our largest local school districts are running out of foods for school lunches. Supply chain issues. Supply Chain Disruptions School Lunches   While some can start packing homemade lunches many high-poverty families can't. I saw this first hand working in my school as a librarian. Doesn't matter why but kids need to eat to function and stay healthy. I've been stashing extra veggies with some leftover freezer baskets-I was watching a video blogger and she was talking about doing self rationing moving forward. That idea, if things start getting pretty tight, might be VERY useful. People survived the Depression doing that. *** UPDATE*** Here's the video I was speaking about, I really like her approach (on this blog I do, however, stay of politics)If you can't see videos on your phone choose \"web version\" at the bottomAnother good vlog of her's is called Make Them Feel Pain NOW, about cutting back and getting used to it!I also think it is really about RESILIENCY. We might have to change how we shop, how we eat, how we garden and preserve foods. How could we barter moving forward? What do we spend $$$ on? Do we really need the newest technology, streaming services, etc? Do we really need to spend, spend, spend like we used to? I just shake my head when people buy certain things. People are worried about buying plastic toys for their kids and not buying food or fuel. With everything on the news about this perfect storm people still bury their head in the sand. There are also so many people that can't cook anything from scratch, at all. If I gave somebody a bag of flour, baking soda, baking power, etc. they would probably look at me and say \"what am I supposed to do with this?\" I used to make homemade mac and cheese for our kids, on a work night, and it didn't take that long! Cook the pasta, make a simple cheese sauce, toss toss toss and it's what's for dinner. No preservatives, no fake food coloring, just plain food. I'm hopeful that some folks can make the tough transition I think is coming with some flexibility. I hope so. For now winter is coming, time to get your house in order... Canning Tomatoes Vs Dehydrating-We harvested all of the tomatoes recently so I finally had enough to can some! Pretty easy to do, add a some lemon juice to water and off they went. Because some of them are really dead ripe I didn't really push them down hard enough. There were a few floaters, but that's okay. I have some more, will wait another week and let those ripen a little bit. I mixed the really ripe ones with the slightly less ripe ones to balance out the flavor. After thinking about it I decided to dehydrate the rest, it's faster and take less space to store. They'll look like this-This jar is full now, 1/2 gallonWe have made some nice pizzas too! I buy dough from a local pizza place, add tomatoes, herbs, etc, yummy!Pepperoni, tomatoes, some Moz and it's dinner"},
{"title": "Preparedness 12.0/ Final Harvest, Winterizing The House and Coop", "date": "Oct 13, 2021", "text": "Preparedness 12.0/ Final Harvest-Our first hard freeze is here! Eastern Idaho had several inches of snow two days ago. This is the time of year where you start preparing for winter. As they used to say in Game of Thrones WINTER IS COMING! We wrapped up the harvesting, except the Basil and herbs, covered those with a row cover-High winds so need to weight it downOnly some small green tomatoes are still outside. We'll check on those this weekend. We picked our last really ripe tomatoes and peppers. With the cold snap warning Dave harvested all the last of the large green tomatoes in advance-This is only one tray!The really ripe ones we're using on homemade pizzas this week! Got the dough from a local pizza place. Some of the others I'll be freezing or I may make a big pot of pasta sauce. The green ones we will lay out and let ripen slowly. They never have quite as much flavor but they're good to use in soups and things. I dehydrated lots of dead ripe tomatoes, more coming!This time of year we winterize the house, doing things like closing up the foundation vents, putting out some fleecy blankets for snuggling. I'll be adding our heavy comforter this weekend to our bed. I moved my summer clothes into our spare bedroom closet. Got out all my flannel blouses and fleece. Luckily I bought more wool socks last month! One of the things we do to winterize the houses is buy some of Costco's amazing chocolate/almond biscotti's! They are so good with a cup of something hot on a cold day. Winterizing the house includes the yard like putting away the hoses, pump is out of the pond and we moved some of the perennials in pots to winter-over in the garage. I'll pack up my garden bench and cover with plastic this weekend. Got out my small space heater for the kitchen. The big sliding glass doors make for a cold spot near the desk-Link to my post Low Cost Ways to Keep Your Home Warm for more ideas. We got the cars ready for winter- new wiper blades, got out the snow scrapers, added a blanket in the backseat of each car. All those little things in case you get stranded and buried! What I bought this week- more acorn squash, lemons (small amount of pesto to still make), misc stuff.  FOR MORE REALITY CHECKS- 5% inflation (today), new of possible brownouts/blackouts in some areas possible, droughts equal less foods, last springs freezes equals less foods and feed for ranchers, gas is going up, sizes going down /prices up (shrinkflation), less food in the stores, restaurants having less staffing/ more areas closed off, less available online to buy, trucking shortage, blackouts in China affecting manufacturing. Here's some visuals and links-  From Wskg.org Supply Chain TroublesGrocery Stores Food Shortage    China's Power Crunch  Australia Victorian Home Quarantine Selfie App   Natural Gas Prices SkyrocketingAgain- no down side to being prepared Winterizing the coop is actually fairly easy. We have a large window on the bottom of the coop that faces East. In the spring we switch it out, put on a frame with hardware cloth for ventilation (Dave built). We also took off the glass panel on the storm door. It was part of our Coop Rehab  Works much better than the old warped wood door, and it was recycled! The upper coop window (recycled) slides and can be opened as needed-Lower vent on the leftDave put the big glass panel on the coop wall back on and added the glass panel to the storm door before the freeze hit. They still have good ventilation through the lower vent and the coop itself is not airtight. There's also a vent in the roof. The main thing with the coop is that you do not want to have too much moisture inside. We also have the upper window that we can open if it gets really warm. Will be adding our exterior extension cord soon, to plug in their water so it won't freeze. It also allows us to turn on a light inside the coop if we have to go out after dark. I decided not to add a light at night to get more egg production. We do use a hardwired-in heat lamp and a reptile ceramic disc for additional heat if it gets really cold. Usually that would be in the teens or lower, but it depends. The good thing about the deep litter method is it actually generates some heat in the winter as it slowly breaks down. We love that method and there's never any odor! We'll add the sunroom soon, the new design worked great last year-Just knocked off the snow once in a while!"},
{"title": "Preparedness 11.0/ Amaranth Grain ", "date": "Oct 7, 2021", "text": "From Canr.msu.eduPreparedness 11.0/ Amaranth Grain - Good ideas above, time to remind myself on occasion! First hard freeze is coming next week, winter's coming. We'll be winterizing the coop, closing the house vents, getting out the warmer bedding and winter clothes. Bye bye summer! So it was time to harvest Basil. I made a big quadruple batch of Rosie's Pesto. The Basil plants did great with three big pots full,  I harvested about 80%Luckily the pine nuts I get at Winco are bulk, so I save quite a bit there. I always grate the cheese first in the food processor then set aside, juice the lemons, etc. I make it and freeze in small jars I bought years ago-Little jars ready with fresh lemon juicemade 13 jars total, off to the freezer! I also saw Rosie's recipe for this Cajun Seasoning- We harvested another nice batch of tomatoes, cukes and peppers, tons more green on the vine to bring in next week-headed for freezer, and/or pasta sauce this weekendI had heard of Amaranth, but had never eaten any. I've tried lots of various unusual grain over the years- Millett, Teff, etc. I decided to buy some, it was less than $3.00 a LB, so I bought about 2 Lbs. I did some research and here's a nice looking breakfast dish Blueberry Amaranth Porridge  You could do lots with this, since it's a great source of protein! Lots of info here on nutritional info Food Facts Mercola AmaranthI hit the Dollar Tree and scored four bags each of black beans, Northern beans and rice. No price changes yet, may coming according to the national news-Bought two bags of these to try-I've continued to stock up on bulk spices, more cabbage for the fridge, filling nooks and crannies. I seasoned my new thrifted cast iron pot, came out great! What are you doing to prepare for winter?"},

We decided to take a short day trip up to McCall for a change of scenery and a mental health break. Great weather, saw six deer, clear skies and 70 degrees! Random shots-saw tons of these on the ground, not sure what they areWater is lowWe hit our favorite thrift store! I found a really nice expensive-looking ceramic garlic holder for fresh garlic-$2.00The store was just putting out a cast iron pot with a lid. As the worker was taking a photo I asked her how much it was? She said \"well what do you want to offer me\"? I looked at the bottom and said \"made in Taiwan\",  looked in pretty good shape. I offered her $12, she said yes and I bought it! It needs a good scrubbing but it was already seasoned which was good. Not sure how old it is. I had read lately a lot of people bake round loaves of bread in round cast iron pots. Always good to have an extra pot anyway since sometimes we have company and need the extra cooking containers-We stopped at the Ace Hardware store since I had a funny feeling they might have some canning lids. And boy did they! I bought some Pur brand wide-mouth canning jars. I think Pur bought out part of the Mason company.  After I did some digging I think that the lids are made in Colorado. I was really happy that the price, 12 lids for $5 so I bought five boxes. Who knows what next year will bring? Good to plan ahead-I took a day of work for projects, that was much more relaxed! I did a little fall baking, using the last of my canned apples slices from several years ago. Lots of cinnamon and an oat/crumble topping, yummy! On the preparedness side I heard Costco is not only limiting items but will be hiring their own cargo freighters, just like Home Depot. Our grocery store, Winco, seems to be pretty well stocked for now. The Dollar Store is on the national news, now their prices going up. I just keep looking for gaps I can fill now inexpensively. I bought some soy sauce, pork chops (to freeze), ketchup, Bronner's apple cider vinegar. We use vinegar in the chickens water, great for probiotics and shell strength. I bought some nice bell peppers, .50 cents each, to freeze-Went to our fave farmstead, bought pumpkins and fresh local fruit, gypsy peppers, squash, peaches and plums-fun pumpkins! squashsMore bulk spices, chives and parsleyI just froze two dozen eggs since the production is slowing down a little bit. Will freeze another dozen.I finally found some dried small red beans to make red band and rice, recipe here Authentic Louisiana Red Beans and Rice  This is a recipe you can really play around with. I had a frozen pork shank so I used that for flavor, much better than overly-salty ham hocks! Served with biscuits, and lemon cukes, love those beans-Nice haul from the garden, will freeze some-I had to turn off Youtube and take a break from all the prepping info last week. I was on information overload. I can see the writing on the wall (to a certain extent) of how the next year (or two) might roll out.  I will say frankly it's looking pretty bad. I just read that natural gas is skyrocketing and that could be really tough for a lot of people this winter. At least we do have several oil-filled radiant heaters. They don't use a lot of power and a great to heat up individual rooms. The UK is running out of fuel and calling in the military to help. Ships stuck on the coast, droughts, etc. I think for some people who don't know how to cook from scratch, garden, preserve foods or fix things life might get pretty ugly. Sometimes you have to make SACRIFICES. My family did that during the depression. You adjust and keep going. I'm hoping I'm wrong, but we'll see. After watching a YouTube video the other I thought about some \"what ifs\"??? What If ? ****What if you couldn't find any clothing/shoes/household goods for a year? What if groceries and other supplies become more and more limited? What if you couldn't get basic medical care? What if your main source of heat for the winter quit working? What if you had trouble getting water? What if you lost power for an extended period of time? What if you didn't have internet access? ****Some of those questions get your wheels spinning. So what kind of backups might you be able to have? Can you barter? Can you make things? And how can you modify your home/life to be more resilient? For urban folks I HIGHLY recommend the Retrosuburbia book, see left sidebar for more info.  Full of amazing ideas! Here's my fave new Youtube channels, tons of great info there Melissa Norris Modern Homesteading and this too Simple Living Alaska, check them out! Gives me helpful tips and tricks and something positive to focus on if I get bummed out. Hit the thrift stores, for instance and buy tools, etc. Tools would be a great barter item. Think outside the box. I know, it's not redCanning Rhubarb Sauce-Every year our neighbor (who hates rhubarb), lets us harvest hers, we give her eggs. This year we got about 10 lbs. I froze it in vacuum bags back in July, then thawed this weekend-Here's what I used, was a little too sweet so I added a little bottled lemon juice  Canning Rhubarb Sauce. The 10 Lbs came out to 13 jars. I did adjust the sugar a little bit lower and it was still pretty sweet so I was just a tablespoon of lemon juice. Nice to have more homemade food! It came out a bit green, that rhubarb isn't the really red version, and I don't like food coloring. It's tasty! Good on top on ice cream, cereal, yogurt or plain."},
{"title": "Preparedness 9.0 / Dehydrating Frozen Foods, Autumn Decor! ", "date": "Sep 22, 2021", "text": "Preparedness 9.0/ Dehydrating Frozen Foods -I wanted to start doing more of a variety of food preparedness so I decided to bring out my food dehydrator! I bought it probably 15 to 20 years ago and didn't use it that often, but it works great. I have the Nesco/American Harvest brand.  I started reading articles about how some people bought frozen foods (already chopped, etc.). Once thawed you can then just put them on the food dehydrator. I started off with some chopped spinach which work great! I wanted something to add to soups, scrambled eggs, etc. Fresh spinach is very perishable so I thought drying some would be a good option. The first batch of spinach came out great! I did two medium sized bags of spinach which converted to one medium sized jar, see above.I also bought a bag of blueberries and will also be working on some cubed carrots and peas. One nice thing about food dehydrators is you can turn it on and walk away. One of my rules however is I never run it over night while I'm sleeping. To me it's just not worth the fire hazard. I dried one bag of blueberries, definitely took a lot longer since there was more liquid in them. Those converted to a smaller jar. I'll probably do a few more bags of blueberries since those are really great in cookies, muffins, oatmeal, etc. blueberriesOff to the pantry! I did realize after the fact I should have sprayed a little Pam or oil on the food dehydrator trays as the berries were pretty sticky. You could also use parchment paper. So if you want to do some food dehydrating just buy some frozen veggies already prepped and throw them on the tray! Needless to say you can also do your own or store-bought fresh vegetables and do the prep yourself. We getting more tomatoes so I think I'm a dry some, slice them really thin and dry 'em up! You can dry in your oven on low heat too, just use a cookie sheet. I may try some jerky too.What I bought this week- Some canned foods from the Dollar Store. Goya red beans, some Halloween candy (hoping for trick or treaters), two totes of shelf stable 2% milk, two bags of lentils, Himalayan salt, two tins of Mackerel in tomato sauce, barbeque sauce, two cans of coconut milk to make some curry or smoothies. They had lots of canned meats, but some are way too salty for me. I bought a small amount of some mylar bags and oxygen absorbers to package up smaller amounts. I don't want to preserve huge bags of grains, etc for just two people. Easier to do smaller bags, open as you need them. Got a few fun Halloween things for my home office, not going back to the office any time soon.  And a fun Autumn sign for the deck herb box-speaking of autumn....Autumn Decor!I never liked putting up Autumn decor when it's hot. Now that it's cooled off I was in the mood for putting up some Autumn goodies! I got out my seasonal items and bought a couple bags of small pumpkins. I put all my generic stuff away, now I'm feeling ready for some ginger cake! My mom always made boxed ginger cake in the fall, I still occasionally make that, but I had a handful or two of raisins or chopped nuts. Quick dessert on a busy weekend, top with whipped cream and that's fall to me. Ironically I'm not much on all of the pumpkin flavored stuff. The only reason I even made pumpkin pie for Thanksgiving let's because everybody else liked it. To me it's just squash! Here's a peak around the house, we'll get cornstalks soon for the front entrance and a few larger pumpkins-Dining roomLiving roomMy Etsy faves!

{"title": " Preparedness 8.0/ Independence Days Challenge", "date": "Sep 15, 2021", "text": "Dehydrating spinachPreparedness 8.0-Autumn is in the air! It was 45 degrees this morning, nice and cool. Days are getting quite a bit shorter. I'm ready for fall after the 100-degree record-setting days that we had this summer. I've been watching quite a few different social media platforms in different areas of the country. Most everybody is seeing slow but steady shortages of foods and rising gas prices. I'm doing a few things here and there steadily. As someone said before \"there's no downside to preparedness\". I did hear recently that there is probably gong to be a paper shortage (if there isn't already) due to wood pulp material prices, up 50% over the last year. If you need paper supplies you might want to stock up now when prices are lower. I've been looking at more simple recipes for in the future. It's good to have foods like beans and rice on hand, they store a long time, and easy to switch up the flavor. Cheap too! One of the things to think about with preparedness is seasonings! I decided to start a spice basket, since I had an empty one. While I have lots of spices in my kitchen I don't really have any extras. I'm really lucky we live right near a WinCo store and they have a huge bulk section. So I decided to start stocking up and it is so cheap it's crazy! I decided to reuse some recycle glass jars with some canning labels-bulk-  peppercorns, dill, cinnamon and onion powderGreat for meat and fish! Big containerI started thinking about what spices I use a lot of and for me it's oregano, thyme, basil, garlic, onion powder, Dill, peppercorns, and salt of course. This will stay near my pantry in the extra bedroom. Buying bulk spices is a really great way to save a lot of money and they're usually fresher!!!We bought two extra bags of feed for the chickens and two bales of pine shavings for the coop. That should last us for quite a few months ongoing. Luckily our feed is made locally but there's never any guarantee of what their production will be.Independence Days Challenge-Here's the recent doings....1. Plant Something-Wrong time of the year we are in harvest mode. Too warm for fall crops. I may start growing microgreens indoors this winter. 2. Harvest Something-We've been getting a nice steady supply of tomatoes, several kinds, eggs, cucumbers, peppers. I also have tons of Basil I'll be making pesto soon to freeze. Ready to freeze more eggs! Lovely apples! 3. Preserve/Store Something-I have canned pears, we had a smaller harvest, we think someone stole some. I only canned six Qts, since we had to save some jars for the peaches. Luckily we have seven Qts from last year. We like them fresh too, super sweet and juicy-Fresh on the dining table! Froze apples slices too for baking. Will be canning some of the frozen peaches soon. We have several one-gallon bags of frozen rhubarb, I will turn into rhubarb sauce and can. I've frozen extra meats recently, like chicken breasts on sale and breads. I'll be making some fermented Curtido slaw soon. I love that stuff! For dehydrating I bought frozen spinach, frozen broccoli and blueberries. I learned you can save a lot of labor (since I don't grow those) by buying frozen, thaw, then dry. Little to no prep!  SpinachI bought some Auguson Farms pancake mix, $8.00 right now, on Amazon. That will be for more long-term storage (freeze dried). I also bought some local pancake mix for using sooner. I'm hoping if the weather holds and the tomatoes ripen I may have enough to can, fingers crossed. I usually freeze them.  4. Manage Reserves- Get a Good Deal/Barter/Stock Up/Prep-I have been buying things I think may be in short supply in the not-too-distant future. I bought some holiday gifts. This is also where it's really good to do just an inventory of what's in your house that you might not be able to find later. What about dental floss? Toothpaste? Pet food? I bought some cheeses to freeze and a bag of Masa to make tortillas. Got to have cheese for the winter on top of soups and tacos. Also bought some mushrooms, dried and canned, those kinds of things are really good to flavor foods. They don't cost a lot of money, 50 cents a can and $4.00 for a bag of dehydrated (Natural Grocers).  Fresh mushrooms have a short shelf life. I had a yearly credit from REI, I bought some water purification tabs, just in case-Got a big bag of Ricola cough drops at Costco, peanut butter powder, and smart wool socks for me!  I found two gallon buckets with lids (food grade) at Winco for $4.00, a rectangular one for $3.00, bought one of each. They are twice that at Amazon. Sugar will go into one of them-has gasketed lid 5. Eat the Food- Try New Foods/Recipe-I'm going to be trying some new bread recipes soon once all of the fruit is done being processed and I can catch my breath. I decided to get back into bread-making, some to save money, but also gain more expertise. Made my fave summer sandwich Sara Moulton Catfish BLT with home grown tomatoes! 6. Build Community Food Systems-We've been sharing eggs and pickles with our kids and haven't gone to the farmers market for a while. Might go again soon,  we'd love to get some pumpkins! 7. Recycle/Re-Use-We use some of my glass jars I saved from some olives last year for my spice basket. Also using some small canning jars for those spices as well. We got several free ornamental grasses (1 gallon) from a local nursery. They were looking a little bit beat up, 75% off. When we decided to add a few more flowers to our front yard the sale person gifted us four grasses! Free, ka-ching!  8. Skill Up-Definitely learned a lot about food storage last few months, an interesting process. Do you use Mylar bags? Do you use oxygen absorbers? What do you never want to use oxygen absorbers on, like sugar? Thanks YouTube, now I know.9. Regenerate What is Lost/Salvage Something-Fixed up my semi-broken birdhouse I got from the thrift store, came out pretty cute! Love the prim stars on both sidesCute tin roofFixed a part of our front driveway area that was pretty beat-up looking with some sick shrubs. More photos coming."},
{"title": "Fruit Harvest!  Preparedness 7.0/ What I Bought This Week ", "date": "Sep 8, 2021", "text": "Fruit Harvest!Apples and pears! Dave and I spent a good chunk of Sunday afternoon canning apple slices. Usually I do all of it by myself, so it was really helpful to have Dave with me. He was basically in charge of rinsing, slicing, cutting off any bad spots. I was in charge of the syrup, prepping and packing the jars, canning and processing. Worked great that way! And I love my new steam canner! It uses so much less water, more efficient than the old one, much nicer experience. My old steam canner used to have a lot more water added after every batch. It took longer to heat it back up. This used a lot less water so the heat up time was much shorter, and great seals on everything! Will be working on processing some of raw apples that are left over by freezing those in vacuum bags. Sadly someone started stealing some of our pears so we went ahead and picked them, and will be canning them also. Fresh and raw is the best though, uber juicy! Out tomatoes are finally turning red and Basil is HUGE, almost time for pesto! Preparedness 7.0/ What I Bought This Week-We went to Target to buy something. Their ENTIRE seasonal section was empty, nothing there but empty racks. More to come I expect. I bought my grandson some gifts for birthday/holidays early, who knows what will be available later? Sshhh- I got books and art stuff. Got Cadbury chocolate bars for $1.50, everywhere else are $2.50! I bought four, for when the zombies come! Found some Wallyworld Keystone beef, chicken and ground beef, $6.00 a can, just cooked meat and sea salt, simple ingredients. This other store now also has zero cashiers. Not fun on my back with the bad ergonomics of the bagging stands.  Bought some Jasmine rice, a 10# can Augason Farms dehydrated potato slices for $8.00. Fresh taters never seem to last too long. I might dry some of my own soon. Got some mixed canned veggies and frozen peas (almost all gone). Got 1/2 gallon apple juice, salt, more plastic canning jar lids. Got some new (free) jeans from Eddie Bauer with a free $10.00 coupon. What a deal, marked $10.00, zero outlay! I bought a nice big bag of Jasmine rice, great flavor, and fast to cook. When I poured it into a 1/2 gallon mason jar some of the rice was floating in the jar. Like on cobwebs, ew. Time to freeze! Planting Amaranth? -I remember seeing this growing a long time ago. This might be perfect in Idaho high desert, will look to finding some seeds. Lots of great info here on how WOMEN saved this species.  Ancient Grain Amaranth  It's amazing how some people don't grow this, think of the water savings and protein!"},
{"title": "Finally Garden Veggies! Preparedness 6.0  - Calories vs Nutrition, September Is National Preparedness Month! ", "date": "Aug 31, 2021", "text": "Finally Garden Veggies!With our late start (due to crazy weather) and then HOT crazy weather our veggies took a beating. We have finally cooled down into the 80s and so things are settling in. All the watering paid off! I harvested one lemon cucumber a week or so ago. Tonight we got two wonderful tomatoes, two slicing cucumbers, several pickling cukes and a medium sized zucchini! The tomato plants are really loaded and there's some paste tomatoes that are orange, almost ready. Will go out into the garden today and trim back a little bit of the foliage to help the tomatoes get riper faster.  We're still getting eggs, apples are not quite ready for Labor Day weekend I think. I will be doing peaches instead for canning. Because it's been so busy on the weekends so I decided to freeze the peaches until I could can a bunch of them. So that's the plan!Preparedness 6.0 - Calories vs Nutrition/ What I Bought This Week-There's lots of preparedness foods, like freeze dried, out there. Some are pre-mixed foods, some are single food, like fruits, veggies and proteins. I started looking at ingredients, reviews and taste tests. Here's a few things I noticed right out of the gate: lots of lots of empty calories, lots of dairy based products, white flour and a lot of salt. Obviously there's a difference between starving to death because you don't have anything to eat versus maintaining your health. If you're in a real emergency situation if you're really active you need plenty of protein/crabs and calories. One of the things I saw was a few different brands that specialize in freeze dried foods that have one ingredient. For instance freeze dried chicken chunks. Big difference between that and a chicken flavored casserole meal with white rice, salt chicken flavoring and dairy. With the chicken chunks you can make all kinds of different meals! So if you're looking for different foods to store for true preparedness, whether freeze-dried, dehydrated, or canned,  check the label and think about what you're buying. Dave and I are pretty allergic to most Dairy. I can eat a small amount with a meal but if I overdo it I really pay for it with major acid reflux. If Dave eats too much Dairy he also has some issues but they're different. So I was good to realize what your options are. There's also taste, good review here-  Glad I haven't bought  any ReadyWise!What I Bought This Week-Two books, used on eBay, both by the same author- and I used to follow Wendy's old blog (now defunct) wanted to read her books. I found her new blog Milkingsquirrels.blogspot.com  Great stuff! Nice interview with her here Failuremag.comA little inspiration-Went back to Grocery Outlet and bought some more unbleached King Arthur self-rising flour. I also found some other organic unbleached flour. Bought some organic spelt berries for grinding for a different kind of flour, two more containers of crunchy peanut butter to stash and some cocoa powder! I won't survive the apocalypse without chocolate! The great thing about cocoa powder as you can use it for almost anything, baking, hot chocolate, Etc. Bittersweet chocolate chips, great for baking in the winter, a big loaf of a whole grain rustic Artisan 1/2 price. Got a nice box of cans of fat-free refried pinto beans, some more canned sliced carrots. I bought a new steam canner, one with a thermostat. The other one I have worked perfect, but you have to sit and wait for a steam plume to start your time. I thought this would be more efficient. There's quite a few University Extension office's that recommends steam canning. I've also done water bath canning but it's a lot simpler, not so much water with steam canning. There still seems to be quite a few canning jars in stock locally, just zero lids. Also got extra cat food! Anya has a sensitive tummy, has to eat super soft food/pate.  September Is National Preparedness Month-With Louisiana being hit by another hurricane, Ida, good reminder you just never know when things can happen. Food, water, meds, basics are really critical, as well as being able to get info. When cell towers go down good to have a hand crank radio! Link here Ready.gov and here Redcross.org , there's tons of site online for lots of info, don't forget your pets!"},
{"title": "Fermented Pickles/ Preserved Peaches In Honey/ Preparedness 5.0", "date": "Aug 23, 2021", "text": "Wow, 42 last week! Fermented Pickles/ Preserved Peaches In Honey/ Preparedness 5.0-Autumn is in the air! It is finally cooling down what a nice trend! Tomatoes are just turning pink finally!!! What a late start/severe hot weather we've had. It's been interesting seeing what's going on in some of the local grocery stores. We tried to buy some distilled water this weekend and couldn't find any in a very large store. We were told by one of the cashiers that the plastic bottles that the water goes in is made in China and so there's a shortage of them. We went to a Walgreen's pharmacy and found some there, but they were almost out. We were told there that there was a shortage due to labor issues in California with workers. Not enough people in the factories to fill the water bottles. Beef prices have really skyrocketed! Glad that's not something we eat a lot of anyway. I do have three roasts I bought months ago in the freezer. I decided to start making some homemade bread soon and will probably stop buying sandwich bread completely. We eat one loaf a week, maybe. Luckily I have a recipe from several years ago that I had made successfully. I did buy some King Arthur flour whole grain dough enhancer. Basically makes it rise a little bit more and is not quite so dense. I'm looking forward to baking some bread and always makes the house smell so great! I saw a dough whisk and decided to buy one, comes with a curved scraper-Comes with a flexible scraper- $7.00 on AmazonI am still stocking up on a few small things here and there quite like canned veggies. I also found some nice big bags of frozen veggies at Costco. I suspect that over time there will be more shortages of fresh produce so I'm planning ahead. We made a trip Saturday to a place we've gone the last couple of years. It's a rural farmstead store. They have the best pickling cukes! I just couldn't grow enough to use. So I bought a bunch. I did three jars of one with garlic, dill, mustard seeds, black peppercorns. I did one jar with just garlic and dill. I use my fermenting jar with the water lock and three with Mason Tops-The end of last years, still great! We also bought two huge frozen chickens, also local. Last year the ones I bought were almost the size of a small turkey!  Recently I scored some raw local honey in Costco. I decided to try this recipe   Peaches Preserved in Honey Lacto Fermented I may try her Blueberrie recipe next! I took some of our organic peaches out of the fridge, got a clean jar (thrifted) and the honey-all sliced, cinnamon and peppercorns in the bottom I topped off with the Turmeric and added the honey. I had to take a knife down the sides to get it flowing down. I had to add three batches, slowly, about 1 and 1/2 cups, to 1 and a 1/2 Qt jar (about). Now resting and getting bubbles today! I also made some pickled red onions-Slice the onions thins, put in a jar, add a few peppercorns (or diced jalapenos/red pepper flakes), season rice wine vinegar (or apple cider), a little salt, shake well. Great on sandwiches and salads! Let sit for a day or so and it's ready!!!"},

Cooking Home-Frozen Fresh Eggs", "date": "Aug 16, 2021", "text": "New FreezerSome Food Shortages / Cashier-Less Walmarts/ New Freezer Preparedness 4.0-It's still pretty warm here and smoky but I think fall is hopefully on the way soon. With our bumper crop of peaches frozen (for now) and apples on the way we decided to buy a new freezer. Our 1st one is 7.5 cubic feet. Works great! We priced a upright but were way too expensive, $600.00+ . For $190.00 we got a Magic Chef 5 cubic feet that fits in my office, near all the food storage. Flour on top will go in after it chills. We got ours at Home Depot, Lowe's had similar ones too. We were happy to find one, as there was a shortage last year!  From Psitivelyosceola.comWe did some shopping last Friday night at a Walmart that we hadn't been to in quite a while. I'm not a big Walmart fan, so I don't go there very often. Maybe once or twice a year. I decided to pick up a few things that I knew they would have like powdered whole milk, etc. I found what I was looking for and then went over to the meat section and there was a whole section for chicken that was completely empty. I'm talking a really long cooler, multiple shelves probably 15 to 20 feet long. I should have taken a photo, but I didn't sorry. I was just kind of shocked! I've been hearing about food shortages from various people I know on social media, seeing it firsthand was different. The other thing that we ran into was going to check out. There were literally zero cashiers to check out. It was all completely self checkout. Dave and I kept looking around thinking we were not seeing the cashiers and realized that there simply weren't any. I ran across this article, as well as something else in social media, Positively Osceola.com I guess this going national. Really makes me wonder how many people are now out of jobs? Walmart's always been known for just making money and this sadly is another example. I did go to a local WinCo store on the weekend and their meat supply was totally different. Everything was completely full and stocked, with chicken parts for .99 cents a Lb. I was also able to find some canned beef in gravy there, which I had heard about. I bought a couple cans, might be good for a change at some point. I finally got my tote of oats in some 1/2 gallon jars-I bought two of these on sale at Amazon, $15.00 each, good deal! We love black bean cakes!I also bought some whole shelf-stable milk for guests or baking, etc. -From Littlehouseliving.comWhole Powdered Milk = Butter!While we don't drink much milk I decided to buy some whole powdered milk, $4.00 for a small tin at Wallyworld-Spanish label (English directions on the back)When I saw this article it made me think, you can make butter if needed! Little House Living Making Butter  Good to know, and you can make simple cheeses as well Make Cheese From Powdered Milk Good to know x 2! Cooking Home-Frozen Fresh Eggs-I saw a Youtube video a few nights ago about freezing eggs. The person said if you don't whisk them together you'll get this hard lumpy yolk. I decided to do test drive the eggs I froze. After thawing overnight there definitely was a lumpy yolk to be seen-I decided to scramble the eggs, which is what I would usually do for breakfast. I was able to squash the yolks down using a fork repeatedly,  texture was not too bad, flavor was the same. Having said that I would definitely not use these for baking now that I know that. I'll be whisking at my eggs in the future when I freeze more. Going to find out this time of year since the chickens are still laying really well even with the heat! So if you plan on freezing eggs whisk whisk and whisk!"},
{"title": "Update, Food Prices Rising/ Canning Lids & Coffee Shortage/ Preparedness 3.0", "date": "Aug 11, 2021", "text": "Update- We finally got a break from the heat! It was 51 degrees the last three mornings, what a treat! After the heavy rain we real growth spurt in the garden. We're running really behind with our tomatoes since they don't set fruit over 85 degrees. We had 100 degree days for so many weeks I actually don't remember. We recently set a record of the driest three months in the spring in the last 99 years. Not going to be good going into a long drought. Will be re-thinking if we need to redo some of our landscaping to more drought resistant. We've quite a bit, but more is better. It takes planning and we will get some ideas. Our Red Haven peaches have gotten the ripe the last week! Will be doing some canning of the peaches soon. We've already frozen several one gallon bags. We also got six gallons of our neighbors rhubarb we froze as well! She always throws it away so we take it off her hands.  Chickens still laying, freezing more eggs. Food Prices Rising/ Canning Lids & Coffee Shortage/ Preparedness 3.0-I've been trying a few more things to add to our pantry closet. I found this great deal at the local grocery outlet on flour (see above)! I just did a double take when I saw it was King Arthur whole wheat flour, 10 Lbs for $3.00! I bought one, it's in the freezer for a few days to get rid of any critter eggs. I may actually leave it in the freezer for longer-term storage to keep it fresher. We bought two more. Been stocking up on a few more things. I should note we're on a budget like everyone else, and it's been a stretch to stock up and be more prepared. We make it work though, it's buy now and save $ later. I saw boxes of brownie mix too for $1.00 at the Outlet, bought a few. At Albertson's they were almost $4.00! Holy cow. I saw some apples that were almost $4 a pound as well.  I'm glad our apple tree is loaded! I will definitely be canning and freezing apples. With our bumper crop I may also get out of a food dehydrator which I don't use is often. Be nice to have multiple types of fruits. I'm so glad we're getting a good harvest this year. Tomatoes will have to wait and see, but it looks like there's quite a few green ones. Interesting list here of prices that have gone up recently- July Rising Prices  Shocker hot dogs went up almost 5% in July! Glad I'm not a fan (I like polish sausage instead!). Canning Lids- Like a lot of people I've been really concerned with seeing a lack of canning lids in store. Some have mentioned the canning lid duration changing. I've noticed some canning lids that are new Mason and Kerr brand saying that they are good up to 18 months. Some I saw tonight are good for one year. Is this normal, did I miss something? I've had cans for four/five years on my pantry rack that are still fine. Were they always labeled like that?  Is a result of shoddy workmanship and poor quality? I may have to shift toward buying reusable canning lids. Time will tell...Green beansCoffee- I've been hearing thru various social media that coffee is going to may be in short supply soon, if not already. Prices should go up, bad crops in S. America, etc. I saw you can buy green coffee beans, unroasted. You can store them long-term without going bitter, just roast in small batches in a hot skillet. Might be a good idea for any real hardcore coffee drinkers. You can also buy regular beans to the freeze, but some people say that makes them bitter. If you're not much of a coffee drinker you can also buy instant, if you don't really care that much. Lots of videos out there on how to roast your own green coffee beans. I saw beans for sale on Amazon/Etsy. The prices seem to vary depending on where the beans came from. So if you're hardcore coffee drinker you may want to invest in some beans! And of course do you need a grinder! Glad I'm a tea drinker!!!"},
{"title": "Food Prices Rising/ Chip Shortages/Being Prepared 2.0, What I Bought This Week", "date": "Aug 3, 2021", "text": "Thrifted veggie prints summer fun! Food Prices Rising/ Chip Shortages/Being Prepared 2.0-We're finally got some real rain! Saturday night we got over an inch of rain in less than 24 hours. Hallelujah! I thought I'd share some things I've been hearing and seeing from blogging pals and from other sources around the country. Do your own research and see what you think you might be able to do? This list is not complete. I have acquired various things over the years, some from yard sales/thrift store, some new. I started my bedroom pantry closet after we bought this house, such a small kitchen-There are some people who do preparedness from a very young age, but I'm not one of them. I did develop a food pantry out of a spare bedroom closet, hubby Dave put in some nice shelves for me. I would just put various things in it to try to keep on hand and get good deals. My pantry has evolved over the years which I think is pretty normal. We started buying more things from Costco like paper products. I made more room for those. So here's a few ideas (not in any order) if you want to be a little bit more prepared, but don't know where to start! Feel free to post questions too. Chip Shortages- We were talking to a salesman at a big car dealer this weekend. There are 100's of cars in the Midwest, new, that they can't sell. No microchips for the cars. People are ordering cars with no chips with no delivery date. Really??? A big furniture store in town is running out of TV's, no chips to make more. Make's you wonder where it will end? So as far as being prepared... First off don't think that you have to go out and buy a whole bunch of stuff all at once. Make a plan and and start small. You can become overwhelmed by trying to make a huge change. You can become over-loaded and broke! Here's a good tip-Make a plan & start smallAsk yourself first- where will you put foods/supplies you want to store? How about a closet, under your bed, in an extra kitchen cabinet? Low on funds, can you barter? We have a ton of eggs right now and if times were tough we could trade eggs for other items.Next- buy things you actually eat or use. Don't buy some really cheap food that you don't like just to have something on hand. Dave and I both love black beans so I always keep quite a few of those on hand, both dried and canned. Here's a few ideas to get started if you haven't already. Be creative! This weekend I moved things around. Dave got a free metal bookcase from work that I painted. I added totes for our grandchildren's toys and books-In another bedroom we had a nice white laminate rack with canvas drawers that we had miscellaneous stuff in-I was looking at it and realized that the blue unit should go in my office where the pantry is. I could put the white rack in the spare bedroom which is much dressier! So Dave and I went ahead and flip-flopped those. The metal book case will be much better used for foods, etc., especially smaller items-Toys outFood/supplies inLovely Leggos and stuff into the canvas drawersThe nice thing is all of this is flexible. This list may be long, so can can skip some or come back to it later.... Here's a few ideas to get you started and you can certainly pull up lots and lots of lists online.Water, lots and lots of people forget to have any on hand.  The Red Cross has great simple ideas here, like amount of water for drinking, washing, and personal hygiene. Personally I don't think that's enough but that's me. Baby wipes might be a handy thing to have on hand now for the personal hygiene part in a pinch. They're relatively cheap and use them and just toss them away. Nice item here in the Red Cross Store Clipray Flashlight /Cell ChargerBe mindful with these foods some of them require certain storage requirements. Things like nut butters or flours can go rancid unless you keep them in a cool/cold. Flour and butter freezes great! I do have a couple of buckets of freeze dried fruits and veggies primarily and some smaller cans of various items-I have smaller cans of butter, margarine, celery, shredded dried potatoes, diced bell peppers, eggs, cornmeal and a few other things. I bought those several years ago and have been keeping them in a cool dark place. It's good to know they're there in case of a real emergency. What constitutes a real emergency might be hard to tell?Any kind of dried beans they are usually cheap easy to store and have protein and fiber. Canned meats, sea food and a dry salami-Various flours and grains, rolled oats, Millet. I know some people are allergic to certain grains or have various sensitivities so that's a personal thing that you'd tweak. I just stocked up on some extra WW pastry flour since I was having trouble finding it locally. I also bought some oat flour and wheat berries to grind. Good to have if you can't find baked goods locally or they became too expensive-Will re-store some of the flours in the freezer soonBuy other baking supplies like baking powder, baking soda, yeast, etc.Sugar! You can use for all kinds of things. I just got a 20 lb bag of sugar at Costco for $9.00 Stores really well in a cool dark place, no moisture and no insects (of course). We're lucky that we've never had ants or anything like that in our house. You can also include sugar type products in this list like honey, maple syrup, stevia, molasses, etc. I'll be putting ours in a bucket.Salt! Got to have salt for cooking and baking and general seasonings and it is so cheap stock up! Lots of kinds too. Things like rice, quinoa, pastas, crackers-Canned or dried fruits, vegetables, nuts/seeds, nut butters, etc.Lots and lots of condiments and spices! No one wants to eat beans and rice everyday unless you can have lots of different flavorings added. Things like soy sauce, barbecue sauce, Tabasco sauce, ketchup, etc. Baking spices too, vanilla, cinnamon, etc. Butter, and cheeses that you can freeze. Cooking oils, you need fats. Olives of various kinds. Dried salamis that you can store without refrigeration is a bonus.Coffees and teas! Think variety again. Any kind of foods that you can dry yourself and store. You don't have to own a food dehydrator to dry things, you can certainly use a regular oven. You can buy a food dehydrator, not too expensive and some people to build their own-Drying yellow squash last yearGreat for soups! Comfort Foods! At least give you a lot of different kinds of things for different people. Think instant puddings, Jello, cookies, chocolate, and any other kinds of baking supplies. Alcohol. Even if you don't drink it can be good for bartering or trading.  You can also use for cooking as well! Throw a little bit of red wine on that tough chicken and you will have a nice chicken stew.Tobacco. We don't smoke but cigarettes may be something you could also barter.Pet Food & supplies! Don't forget your Critters! We have our cat Anya, so that would mean cat litter and cat food basically. If worst came to worst and the weather was warm we could actually bring in dry garden soil and put it in her cat box. In the winter when the ground is frozen solid that would not be an option. She has a sensitive tummy so we have to buy special cat food! I did explain to Anya the other day that if times were really tough and we couldn't find her special food I would have to buy dry food and put it in the food processor with water. Anya said better that than nothing!Animal feed. We have chickens and while they do free-range a little bit and eat kitchen scraps like fruits and veggies they would need feed, especially in the winter. We're going to buy a couple of extra bags of feed and store it. Better safe than sorry and it won't go bad and we've never had a rodent problem where we store it in our garage. I could make my own feed in a pinch.Any kind of over-the-counter medication you can think of. Things like Advil, Tylenol, cough syrup, Pepto-Bismol, bandages, antibiotic ointments, etc. Treat yourself at home if you can't/didn't want to go out. Extra paper products like TP, Kleenex,  paper plates, paper cups, garbage bags, napkins. Ziploc bags are great too! You can buy some really large ones. Hefty make some jumbo ones that are heavy and have a really good slider that are good for heavier products like flours. Cleaning supplies- Vinegar, baking soda, castile soap, toilet cleaner, etc. Vinegar and baking soda are cheap and can clean almost anything! If you're able to grow any of your own food this would be a good time to go buy some extra seeds and store them. Another idea would also be to buy some potting soil and trays with starting cubes-Here's a list of some supplies that I have on hand many of them were thrifted so don't think you have to go out and buy everything new! Check out yard sales, estate sales, Craigslist, eBay, etc.Flashlights with extra batteries, matches, candles, tea candles with holdersOil lamps with extra lamp oil. Almost all of the oil lamps I got were thrifted.Hand crank radio with flashlightIce chest/cooler, if you lose power. RX's- Keep your some prescriptions filled. Coleman (or other) camp stove oven, propane heater, propane tanks, various sizesKerosene heater, several kinds5 Gallon water jug (camping), Water purifier (for camping)Canning supplies like jars, lids and rings. Things like Fruit Fresh to keep your fruit from changing color, Fermenting suppliesA freezer, we have a small chest one that works great! For two people we can put a lot of food in there.Solar charger for phone/devices55 water barrel (can use if not frozen)Vacuum sealer system. Great to prevent freezer burn and can also use for dried goods that you want to make really airtight.Radiant/fan electric space heaters (if furnace died)So if you're interested think about it and start small!New bucket and lid for wheat berriesWhat I Bought This Week-I stocked up on a few things for the pantry, here and there-At Natural Grocers I FINALLY found some organic WW pastry flour $8.00, Bob's Red Mill brand! Hard to find in other stores, I bought their last two! Also bought some organic Hard Red Winter Wheat berries, $2.50 for 3 lbs. Looked a few other places, looked like a good deal. Got six bags to store and I do have a manual grinder I bought years ago. Bought two bags of Organic Oat flour, 2 lbs for $2.50, will freeze. Got a bag of unsweetened Coconut flakes. At Lowe's I found two 5 gallon food grade buckets for $5.00 each, bought two. Bought two matching gasketed screw-off lids for $7.00 each. At The Grocery Outlet I bought one large can (almost 3 lbs!) of mixed salted nuts for $8.00.  I split them up and vacuum sealed, will freeze so they won't go rancid.  Also got three cans of Pink Wild Salmon for $3.00 each, 4 gallons of spring water for .89 cents, steel cut oats tub $2.00. I'm feeling better getting more flours and proteins bought and stored. Found some 1/2 gallon Ball jars, 6 pack for $13.00 at Walmart. I bought two packs. Someone was selling these on Amazon for $60.00! Great for storing dried goods, or fermenting! I hope that gives you some useful ideas!!!"},

Flowers are blooming, the pond is full of Water Lettuce! Makes me feel cooler hearing the water running-Weeks and weeks of 100 degrees. We did actually get down to 58 the other morning which is almost like Autumn weather. We may have some possible rain on the horizon later this week just hope it won't spark any fires. Still smoky-I thought these two different blog posts go together given the current state of food prices, etc. Like most people I've been seeing food prices going up over the last year. I was reading last night that food prices have increased by around 60% in the last 12 months. I certainly realize that may not be true for every area and every type of food stuff. It does really show them a very alarming trend that I think is not going to end anytime soon. Having watched the news you can see about the flooding in the Midwest, droughts in the West. I was hearing about droughts in China as well. When you have foreign countries that are buying up huge amounts of American commodities it does make you wonder where we are headed?  People sometimes take for granted that you just go to the grocery store and there's food there. I recently saw an article on the BBC about the shortage of truck drivers in the UK. The shortage of  drivers left some grocery stores with some empty shelves. Because they left the EU many of their foreign truck drivers left and went back to Europe. Driver shortage here too! Interesting article here China Buying Corn and Clogged Ports. I read there's a wheat shortage in China too, interesting article here and how Australia is responding ABC.NET.AU   Our breadbasket, California, farmers and growers are really struggling with the heat and drought there too. California 1000's of Farmers Losing Water Access  I heard this last night though that gave me a good reminder- There's no downside to being preparedThat's really true! What's the downside to getting good deals, storing extra foods, water, etc? After we went thru a tough time a few years back (Dave's layoff) we realized we did so much better than most other people. We had savings, a freezer and a pantry. We also think outside the box. I love eating out, but realized right now I need to do more creative cooking and invest the $ elsewhere. Like food! Better to be prepared than caught off guard. Just do a little every week, every pay check, then pat yourself on the back!  Independence Days Challenge-Here' what we've been up to! I have been re-reading Sharon's book, still very relevant to today! Great ideas! 1. Plant Something-We bought a few more peppers and tomatoes as some of ours died. I started some collard green seeds in a pot since many of mine in the ground died. Ironically I did notice yesterday I have about five or six little tiny collard green plants in the ground! I guess they survived the blistering heat after all. I am going to go ahead and transplant some of the seedlings into the garden when they get a little bit bigger-Need to thin2. Harvest Something-Things growing...Kale, nice and tender!Kohlrabi, not sure if we'll get the heads?Hens photo bombedTomatoes coming soonPickling cukes\"German Queen\" heirloom tomato, bought for Dave's German Mom!Peppers and strawberries soonLast 3 strawberries, at least one heirloom survived! Tons of eggs! Pickling cucumbers, Basil, and blackberries are almost ready! Not much of a harvest this year for some reason, not sure why since they seem to like wet springs. I'm wondering if it's just the really brutal heat we've been having?3. Preserve/Store Something-I checked some of our pantry food supplies, didn't have a whole lot of protein on hand except for beans and rice. At Costco today I bought some wild-caught salmon to freeze, and some canned pulled pork. I have a pretty good supply of tuna which is good! Already some beef and pork in the freezer. Lots and lots of eggs, many of which I am starting to freeze. Will buy some canned Salmon soon to store, nice protein! 4. Manage Reserves- Get a Good Deal/Barter/Stock Up/Prep-Bought half price tomatoes and pepper plants. We do have lots of peaches coming up fairly soon for canning and freezing. Looking forward to that! Dave spotted lots of unsalted butter 1/2 price and bought 5, I am freezing in vacuum sealed bags. My neighbor always gives us her rhubarb and it looks like some of it will be right soon. It freezes so well! Nothing like a rhubarb strawberry cobbler.  I must say I really love having my little vacuum sealer, great for freezing! I also bought some extra nuts (pecans) as well as has a large 20 Lb bag of sugar (canning soon).  I decided I'm going to stock up on some whole wheat pastry flour while prices are what they are. There's a lot you can do if you can bake basic things from scratch.  5. Eat the Food- Try New Foods/Recipe-I'm switching back to more whole grain recently, cleaning up our eating. I had left over chicken breast and modified this recipe Fried Catfish BLTs -I used chicken and cherry tomatoes on ciabatta rolls, fabulous! I also tried this Shrimp sandwich, lovely! Shrimp Salad Sandwich w/ Lime Aioli I used Dave's Killer Bread WW hamburger buns (on sale)-Great on a hot day, no cooking! I added diced celery, home grown cuke and red onion. Tried some Keto ice cream bars at Costco, not bad! I'm buying some herbal teas with no caffeine, easy to use too much. I also found new Kodiak products, we love their pancake mix! Will try these then maybe make my own6. Build Community Food Systems-Went to our local farmers market out in Caldwell the week or two ago. Bought some amazing fresh garlic, cream, some breads and a pie. Will go out again soon.  7. Recycle/Re-Use-I have upcycled a thrifted hose reel. Dave cut off the fleur-de-lis so I could reattach it in another spot. He removed the hose reel part too. Nice rusted patina, but I painted it flat brown since it was a bit scraped. I tried construction adhesive that didn't work too well so Dave screwed it together for me and I touched up the paint-I donated some nice wools sweaters, shoes and extra planters recently. Found some nice, low cost tops on eBay. Low prices, high-end brands. I love things that last! Used my 3 year old collard seeds and they sprouted!  8. Skill Up-Learning all kinds of new things about my new job and benefits! Reading up a lot more about commodities the last few days. I am re-reading my book  9. Regenerate What is Lost/Salvage Something-I thought I might have to buy a new desk for my new job at home, but realized I needed to just reconfigure it. Since we may be going back into the office this fall I really didn't want to spend the money for any desk anyway. I'm working my and cooking more since we just got into some really bad habits the last 6 months. More whole grains, high proteins, lower carbs and more fruits and veggies. And now some flowers!"},
{"title": "Hot and Smoky! Stuffed Italian Peppers, Time for Turkey Tacos! Sun Valley Day Trip", "date": "Jul 18, 2021", "text": "From Oregonlive.comHot and Smoky-It's still in the 100+ degree range and now we're getting lots of smoke for the Oregon fires. Praying for rain! I can imagine how much worse it must be for the local residents! It was in the high 90's today, a little cooler. We're watering and watering and I'm avoiding the smoke as much as possible. I'm keeping the hens cool as can be. I got the BIGGEST EGG EVER yesterday!!!Almost as big as a duck egg, bet it's a double yolker! Rosie, my oldest hen, has been limping the last couple of days, but ran out for treat, so not too bad,  hoping she's okay. Will check her in a few days if she's not better. We've been thinning our peach tree, tons  and tons of fruit! I've been freezing more eggs for winter. I decided to invest in a new \"kit lense\" for my Canon DSLR, since the other one was being glitchy. Best deal ever, $99.00, new and works great! I know some people like to use phones, but once you try a real camera there's nothing better! So much more to play with and you can get creative with the settings. Got some summer camp style decor up, fan had to go up for the heat in the kitchen! Thrifted arrow ($3.00) and print on the left, $4.00!  Stuffed Italian Peppers- Last year I froze some of our organic Marconi Giant Italian Frying peppers. It's one of the latter things we harvest due to the size. I froze them after vacuum sealing, along with our organic tomatoes-I used this recipe but modified a bit A Family Feast   I doubled the filling and sauce since our peppers were much bigger! I didn't fry ours for a healthier version. Freezing the peppers to softened them a bit.  Thawed, the split them and stuffed, then baked. First I thawed the peppers and tomatoes (for the sauce)-Cooked down our tomatoes for a Marinara sauce, look at the juice!!!Mixed all the ingredients for the stuffingGetting ready to go into the ovenReady to eat! I made a garden Fritatta to go with it for dinner, since the peppers had no protein. Made my own version of this Taste of Home.com I skipped the tomatoes and used roasted red peppers. I also re-hydrated some dried homegrown, organic yellow squash-Time for Turkey Tacos!-Dave and I love tacos. I make mine a bit healthier, with still tons of flavor! Here's my basic recipe-Use ground turkey, cook and brown in a skillet with a little oil, drain off excess liquid, add your favorite salsa, Cumin, garlic, salt and pepper to taste. Cook down till done, season as you like, I have added Tabasco before for some heat. Stuff your shells, add grated Cheddar/Jack cheese, Cilantro, olives and hot sauce. Enjoy! Also works for burritos or topping for nachos.  Sawtooth Mountains Sun Valley Day Trip-Dave and I didn't really have any plans for Fourth of July, but we really wanted to get out and go somewhere. So we decided to take a day trip. We went from Boise through Idaho City and up and over from Lowman/Stanley down into the Sun Valley/Ketchum area. There's a shorter way to get there but it's a pretty boring drive thru the Flatlands mostly. We decided to do the longer route up and then take the troop coming back. We took lots of extra water and snacks and it was such a beautiful drive! As soon as you start getting up into the mountains outside Boise it's green with fresh air and we actually drove through a few rain showers. We saw lots of Pronghorn Antelope, but I couldn't get any shots. We stopped at a place and had lunch at over 6,000 feet looking out onto the mountains- Next we went ahead and drove down to the Sun Valley and visited a few different places including Ernest Hemingway's grave. Since Hemingway is such an iconic American author and amazing Idaho figure, we decided to take a brief side. You leave a penny as a thank you to him, others left all kinds of things! We drove around for a while and then decided to head home. It's really nice to sleep in our own beds at night! Here's a few photos of our trip and I can tell you that the photos just don't do it justice!River of No Return valley"},

I'm also doing watermelon, orange Italian cream sodas, lemonade, two kinds of ice creams and we'll have a sprinkler for the grandkids! Tomorrow we're doing a day trip to the mountains, to Stanley, then the Sun Valley/Ketchum area. We'll have lunch in the mountains by a lake and get in some gorgeous scenery!

{"title": "Hot! / Freezing Fresh Raw Eggs, Frugal Homemade Baking Mix 2.0 and Biscuits, Stocking Up Wisely", "date": "Jun 27, 2021", "text": "Hot! /Freezing Fresh Raw Eggs-We are getting hot here, or I should say, still HOT!!! 100+ weather is the norm in the week to come. We water, water, water everyday. We mulch heavily too, of course. Mulching conserves moisture and keeps weeds down. We haven't had this kind of 100+ ongoing heat for quite a few years! Here's our forecast-We are in a full-scale production of fresh eggs! We've been averaging 3-4 eggs a day. We have been giving our adult kids some of our eggs and using up some ourselves. I recently found we had five dozen eggs in our fridge, which is a bit too much! I had recently done some research on how to freeze fresh, raw eggs and decided to try it. There's a few different versions out there, so if you're interested you can do your own research. Basically there are people who basically scramble the eggs with a pinch of salt as a stabilizer. Then there are people who simply freeze the eggs (out of the shell) as is. Most people freeze them in ice cube trays. I decided to give that a try! I found a large ice cube tray made out of food grade silicone that I bought. Some of our eggs are very, very large and some of them tend to run smaller. It seems to vary every week. So basically the really large eggs I put one in a cube. The smaller ones I put two in a cube. When I was able to I put two in a cube combining maybe one medium egg and one small egg-I went ahead and put them in the freezer, levelled them to freeze up completely- After they were frozen I pop them out of the ice cube tray and put them in Ziploc bags labeled with the date-I will probably go ahead and take them out of those bags and use my vacuum sealer for better protection. They kind of look like popsicles! I did read that you should thaw gently in the refrigerator before using or the eggs will be rubbery. These would either be eating scrambled or used in baked goods. What's good to know is we'll have eggs in the winter when our hens slow down their production with the short days. In the near future I will thaw some, scramble and report back on how they came out!Photo from Mennonite Girls Frugal Homemade Baking Mix 2.0 and Biscuits-I posted Mother Earth News Baking Mix last week, here's another version from the amazing website Mennonite Girls Can Cook . They have so many amazing recipes, some gluten free. While some of the dishes are pretty heavy on the fat (think feeding hard working farmers) their baking recipe database is huge! Many you can make more healthy by using whole grains, like WW Pastry flour. Additionally there's a section here Variations On Biscuit Theme with tons and tons of different kinds of biscuits you can make! Too hot to bake right now, but will come in handy in the fall/winter with soups, etc. Browse thru their website, tons there! They also have some cook books online for sale as well.Stocking Up Wisely-With food prices steadily rising I decided to buy some things to freeze for the winter. Yes, winter! In the cold winter months once in a while I like to roast a chunk of beef, with veggies and herbs. I decided to buy some meats at Costco specifically to freeze. I bought a Nutrichef sealer vacuum sealer last year, works great! I bought two beef roasts and one big pack of pork country style boneless ribs. Split them up, sealed and labelled. All done! I have also double-bagged using freezer bags and sucked out most of the air, labelled, also worked well. I also bought a few other things- chicken breast with ribs (50% off) as this time of year chicken parts to BBQ are priced low. Also butter to freeze, organic raisins (great for holiday baking!), extra artisan breads and cheese. It's easy to think ahead- what do I usually buy later that I can store NOW? Grains, beans, etc. all store so easily in bags, jars or cans. We have a bumper crop coming of apples and peaches, less with the pears. I will be canning/freezing those too. Veggies are planted, will store dried herbs and make pesto. I'm hoping our local farmstead will have the same HUGE organic chickens for sale that I got last year! I bought two last fall and they were great. Supports local farmers, good price and stores very well. Like last year I am working on this (made my little sign)-Idea from the Retrosuburbia Facebook Group"},
{"title": "Favorite Frugal, Easy Baking Mix & Biscuit Recipes, Home Office Re-Boot/New Job! Fun Summer/ 4th of July Decor", "date": "Jun 19, 2021", "text": "Recipe here Mother Earth News Baking MixFavorite Frugal/ Easy Baking Mix & Biscuit Recipes-Given food prices going up and the need for simpler foods, (that you can modify) here a couple things I've used! In the course of my reorganizing some of my office things I was looking at my cookbooks. I also had a few printouts from some older blogs, one that is now defunct, Lazy J Bar C Farm. Years ago I printed out her Baking Mix, which was basically the recipe above posted on Mother Earth News. I did modify the recipe using half whole wheat pastry flour so it wasn't all unbleached, for a little bit more nutritional value. It's basically like Bisquick but cheaper, homemade and fresher.  You can use this in all kinds of recipes! You can make biscuits, cookies etc. Sadly Candy's blog is no longer accessible, as had a huge Norton block that red flagged it as a dangerous website. I very rarely see that with Norton so I did not open the site. Here's few recipes from the author Candy that you can make with the mix, ones I had printed and kept-Cheesy Biscuit Sticks-2 cup Baking Mix, 1/4 cup cold butter cut into small pieces, 1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper, 3/4 cup grated cheese (I liked Cheddar) , three quarter cup buttermilk. Preheat oven to 425°, place baking mix, butter and cayenne pepper in a bowl and cut in butter. Stir in grated cheese. Make a well in the center and add buttermilk all at once. Stir together until a soft dough forms. Turned out onto a well floured surface. Dust the top with additional flour. Need gently 8 to 10 times. Pat dough into a rectangle about 12\"by 8\" and about half and inch thick. Cut into sticks separate and place on an ungreased baking sheet and bake for 10 to 20 minutes or until golden brown.And another one-Oatmeal Raisin Cookies.2 cups Baking Mix,, half a pound (two sticks butter) softened, one and a half cups of granulated sugar, 1 tablespoon of molasses, two eggs, 1 teaspoon vanilla,  one teaspoon cinnamon, three cups old fashioned oats, 1 cup raisins. Heat oven to 350 degrees, be together wet ingredients and butter, add eggs and vanilla beat well. Add baking mix and cinnamon, mix well. Stir in oats and raisins mix well. Drop by rounded tablespoons onto ungreased cookie sheet, bake for 10 to 12 minutes or until golden brown. Cool for 1 minute on cookie sheet, remove to wire rack to cool completely, makes about 4 dozen cookies.You can really play around with that basic recipe! And another fave are these amazing biscuits! Recipe Pioneer Woman at Heart BiscuitsAgain you can modify with WW pastry flour, tender and oh so flaky! Another great recipe here Beyond Easy Beer Bread, great with soup or leftovers! Home Office Re-Boot/New Job!Well, I quit my job! I am so happy! I was bored to the extreme, in a great job market (huge shortage of workers here) and I had a great tool belt so to speak. I decided to target an industry that I already had a lot of experience in. I applied with a couple very large organizations and did a Zoom job interview, a first. I accepted an offer with a group whose vibe I really like. Thursday was my last day on my old job (was told to work in the office) and ironically the A/C was glitchy, again. I kept thinking I was the only one who was HOT until I started seeing all the IM's, \"I'm melting!\", etc.  It was 80 degrees inside and dead air. Glad I won't be working there again! It was an old retrofitted building, always had AC/heating issues. Ant then there was leadership, no comment. Will simply say I found myself in a dead end job after promises of growth were made. I took Friday off since my PTO is getting cashed out. Time for a 3 day weekend!!!I decided to deep clean the home office and reorganize a bit with the new job starting. When I started working from home last year I never thought it would last this long! My new job will start off working from home and may start working in the office in the fall. They have pushed that out a couple times already, so time will tell. First thing I did, of course, was turn in all my old equipment to my previous employer. After that I decided to get everything up on the desk. Dave and I pulled it out and vacuumed- I had a printer on a canning rack that I decided to move. That went onto the top of our little cabinet-We had a file tote in the corner for paperwork. I decided to get it out. When we moved the file tote out I was able to put the two space heaters we had in that corner. One was one that I bought for the office for the winter, since I'm on two outside walls. The other was one we bought for a grandson River, but his parents have a new furnace so they didn't need it. They were going to donate it so I asked for it! I figured it would be nice in our kitchen in place of our noisy space fan heater-Nice parking space, clean We had a filing tote in the corner of the room, which I realize we could put the contents of in the kitchen. Basically I had a filing drawer full of cookbooks in the kitchen at our desk. I realized that I can put my cookbooks under the kitchen counter I can get to them and see them. This cart previously had Covid supplies, masks, sanitizer, etc. Then I filed the paperwork in the kitchen cabinet drawer-Cookbooks, many thrifted, some homemade, on wheels! New home for files, good location! All better, space for new canned goods coming soon! Some fun decor, love my faux barn doorFun calendarI wiped off the desk really well, now nice and clean. I'll be bringing home new equipment Monday. Still have my fun decorative stuff on the walls. The space is much more organized, clean and less cluttered. A nice space to start a new job in! Excited!!!Fun Summer/ 4th of July Decor-With all the job hunting changes I didn't get much up til this week! Here's a look around!Dining room shelfNice pops of yellow! I made the topiaryMade the chunky flagMy fave basin on the coffee table, easy! I added a few flags outside, that's it! Off to the mountains tomorrow for the day, for Father's Day!"},
{"title": "           Independence Days Challenge, Trying Natural Dental Care Products", "date": "Jun 15, 2021", "text": "Lots of eggs = bread pudding!Independence Days Challenge-Crazy weather lately, warm then cold. One day was 48 in the morning, was 103 degrees a few days before that! Sunday was 100. Now another cooler front coming. Here's a little snapshot of things here-1. Plant Something- Some perennials (pollinators), grasses and annuals near the new gate/fence-Collard seeds in the bare area in front of the windmillI started a lot of seeds this Spring inside in the grow light shelf unit- With 2 kinds of cukes, squash, Milkweed, Rainbow Echinacea (died so started seeds outside in a pot), Rainbow Zinnias, Marigolds.  Bought some others to fill in-I put those Nasturtiums  in a planter with a windmill, since Lady Bird (First Lady Johnson) was from Texas. I thought she'd like it! I really admire her work, she founded the National Wildflower Research Center Wildflower.org More info also here- Ladybird WildflowersLady Bird Nasturtiums from seedWe bought some 2 kinds peppers, Italian and Sweet Banana. Two kinds of cukes, slicing and Lemon. A tomato, in honor of Dave's lovely German mother Bette- \"German Queen\", a heritage variety. Never tried it! Start some collards from seeds, Swiss Chard from seed maybe-Peppers and a tomato\"German Queen\"We planted a row of strawberries the first time we've tried this so far they look healthy now that they're out from under the grow light . I bought three strawberry plants that were from a heritage variety. Two of them died so I am hoping that the survivor will send out some runners, and we will be able to keep them going. I filled in with a local berry. With a lot of projects recently we are behind in planting the summer veggie garden. The weather was also pretty crazy too! Normally we would have everything planted before the 1st of June. We still have lots of room and we'll be buying the rest of the tomatoes soon. We're definitely having an issue with our maple tree, it's needing to be pruned more, way too much shade on the sunny area. In the spring will bite the bullet and have it pruned back some more-Too much shade 2. Harvest Something- Lots and lots of eggs! Chives and butter lettuce. Averaging 3 eggs per day. I made the bread pudding (above) with Challah bread, bittersweet chocolate chips and walnuts.  Oh man it was so delish!!! Creamy, crunchy and chocolate, what's not to love?  3. Preserve/Store Something- Not yet, but peach, apple and pear trees are loaded this year! Hoping for more bumper tomato crops! ApplesPearsPeachesI was able to find some generic canning lids online at a pretty decent price. The U of Utah came out saying if you buy an off-brand check the seal every few months. I found some Kerr kids, not much over normal price online. I found some jars for sale at one of our local stores. They told me they had \"lots and lots\" and I got there, and there were four boxes, not \"lots and lots\"! I bought 2 boxes of one Qt. jars. Ironically I read that sometimes it's cheaper to just buy new jars than just the lids! These were $10.00 a box.  4. Manage Reserves- Get a Good Deal/Barter/Stock Up/Prep- Just the usual Costco things lately. We had bought some curtains at Ikea a while back which were too long. So I measured, trimmed, hemmed and ironed them (3xs!). Then I realized they were really, really wrinkled still.  I had pre-washed them too. So I did research and  I bought a steamer! Great idea that worked really well and did not cost that much. At Costco got more Wild Brine fermented kraut, Turmeric (great for arthritis for me), TP.  Bought 2 big gallon pots of Basil for $6.00 at a local feed store. Split them up into 10 BIG plants.  The other were $4.00 for 1 plant! We finally used up all of our frozen pesto. Will make more this summer. Lots of Basil!  5. Eat the Food- Try New Foods/Recipe- Working on the eggs. Will be making an angel food cake to go with some fresh berries. Nothing else that I can think of.  6. Build Community Food Systems- A bit too early for farmer's market, but have been giving a neighbor some eggs. 7. Recycle/Re-Use- Dave scored some free yellow Irises, variety unknown, neighbor had a \"free\" sign with 2 big bags, Dave brought them home-He planted them around the front yard for spring. Hopefully they'll survive. We re-used some fence posts we took down from our 6' high fence post repairs, and re-used the shorter sections for the new garden fence gate-Last year I bought this French style hose reel at a thrift store for $8.00 story here Day Trip-I had the idea to have upper section cut off or upcycle it some how. I finally remembered, we got it out and Dave cut it for me with a Sawzall blade. I laid the one piece on top of the pipe, will glue and paint to cover the rub marks. Some nice yard art with a French flair!   8. Skill Up- Learned about how to plant Irises. Haven't grown them before. Interesting reading here on low seed germination rates!  5 Acres and A Dream A New Paradigm for Gardening & Seed Saving Fascinating since I thought I was the only one seeing this.  9. Regenerate What is Lost/Salvage Something- The bees! Last post talked about our bee rescue! We heard they are doing well, queen is laying eggs, happy to have helped! We need bees if we want to eat. I should add- I know some are allergic to bees and may not feel the same way. That can be very scary.  And hoping my teeth will strengthen, more below. Trying Natural Dental Care Products-After recently having a tooth pulled I was looking for something to strengthen my teeth. It's not an issues if you're 20, but for those of us who are bit older, we start thinking about keeping all our teeth! I also recently started using a spare Water Pic. Dave had gotten the kit at Costco which came with a travel size kit (see above).  Since our \"master bathroom\" is a 1/2 bath I didn't want to use the full size version. I realized I could use the small one! Works great!                                                       I have been using some great products already, like a Sonic Care toothbrush. I 've had mine for about 15 years or more. They last forever, just replace the heads every 3 months or so. We get our packs of replacement heads at Costco, since they sell by a 6-pack, much cheaper. The newer units are MUCH more expensive and wireless, which I have zero interest in buying! Luckily you can still buy the ones we use, works great and much, much cheaper! Amazon links or you can buy locally-                                                       I heard about these products and tried them. Here's my review so far, using for a month or more. I tried the paste first, with my Sonic Care turned off. Just used it like a regular toothbrush. It's a paste, just dip your brush. It is thick, not much flavor at first. The more I used it the saltier it got, sea salt being an ingredient. I spit well, rinsed with water and my teeth were clean and shiny! I did follow up with my regular paste to cancel the leftover taste. I think some people add essential oils to this. I might do more research. I used the re-mineralizing rinse next. Very mild flavor, the label warned it might be strong-Used this next, okay, not needing the detox as much (hopefully!). My gums are super healthy, more worried about my teeth.The kit I bought is out of stock, but this is the closest, comes with the tooth powder instead of the mouth wash, or you can buy individually.                                                               I do floss daily, I love little dental pics, easy to keep in the car, on the desk, by my couch, cheap and effective!"},
{"title": "Emergency Bee Evac! Garden ReHab Phase 4 Fencing, Coop Rehab 2.0", "date": "Jun 4, 2021", "text": "Emergency Bee Evac! I love bees, always have, always will! When I came out mid-afternoon Wednesday, into the back garden, I noticed there was something all over some fence boards. When I looked at it for a minute I realized it was moving and it was covered with bees!I called Dave right away to see if there was a beekeeper who could come and collect the swarm safely and keep them. Luckily we had two bee keepers come over, one was a master, one an apprentice. They came over and removed the swarm gently and safely. Took them several hours, luckily we haven't planted the veggies yet so they had plenty of room to work. They said we were the nicest people they've ever worked with and will bring us some honey from their other hives! We had to give them some money even though they refused at first, because they were in 95-degree heat, cooking trying to save these bees. It was 103 yesterday, record heat!!! Apparently they were looking for a new hive and were Italian bees which I have never heard of. It all ended up very well. The swarm and the queen found a new home and all is well in their bee world! Maybe someday I can have my own hives! They removed several fence boards and put the hive box (not sure waht it's called?) in the easement. They found the queen in the grass behind the fence, and got her safely into the new hive box thingy-Bulk of the bees on the back of the boardsStill swarming a bitNew hive box mostly fullBy 9 pm Dave got the fence boards up back up.  We let the hens out of the coop and the hive box got picked up after dark. Good outcome! Garden ReHab Phase 4 Fencing-The garden fencing had been around for about 10 years and basically works as a separation between the chicken run/coop and the main backyard garden. When we first built that we used a lot of recycled wood and new chicken wire. With all the weathering it was getting pretty dilapidated, so we decided to do something about it. Dave priced panel fencing and new 4' x 4's. As everybody knows by now lumber prices have really skyrocketed. When I was looking for a gate to go with with the potential new wooden fence I saw a gate and got me thinking. Started wondering what the pricing would be for metal fencing instead? Something that would be really durable but didn't need to be heavy since it's basically just keeps the chicken out. It won't have any big heavy dogs jumping on it or kids climbing on it. Dave and I picked out the design we liked and he went to Home Depot and priced it-$50.00 for 3 panels, about 3' x 4'Turned out to only be about $50 more than what we were going to do, but it was much much less labor.  It will probably last longer since it's powder coated and certainly looks nicer. Total was about $250.00.  Here's the before old fence shots- Hens in the shade area with the mister, nice and cool!So here's what we did-  temporarily fenced the hens into the shade area with access to the coop-I helped Dave pull the old fencing out and we made a pile-We saved some of the chicken wire in case we need some. Dave cut up the wood and it went into the compost bin to be composted by the county. Chicken wire went to recycling. We started with the section closest to the coop-We leveled as we went (lots to level!) and otherwise was pretty easy! Add the stakes and go on-Photos From Home DepotWe had some leftover 4x4's that we were able to use to brace the gate. Dave turned one panel into a gate but it was a bit wobbly. A post on either side, worked great! Gate made by attaching hinges and a clipThe rest of the sections-Attached to fence with clipI will add another ornamental grass to the right of the gate, veggies coming this weekend! Shade area, attached to the coop on the leftWe added some scrap 2x4's to prevent diggingAttached to the coop with washers and screwsTemporary gate clip, fence attached to postAgain attached to fenceWe LOVE it, should last for years to come!!! The yard looks really empty but we will fix that soon! Coop Rehab 2.0-Last week we got the coop pretty well rehabbed. We realized after we put the door up and it was pretty awkward getting in and out. It opened on the right. Dave thought he could go ahead and rotate the door and flip it around, which he did. I went ahead and pulled off the screen panel and replaced the screen with new-big holetools makes it easy!New screen up, glass cleanedDave thought it would be a good idea to put a screen protector up and it was. This weekend one of our grandsons started heading toward the coop and pushed on the screen protector! Great idea!"},
{"title": "Time To Hire A Pro/Bathroom Tile Upgrade! ", "date": "May 24, 2021", "text": "Time To Hire A Pro/Bathroom Tile Upgrade!Back in 2014 we re-modeled our old main bathroom due to rotting floor issues. The tub was probably 20 years old, tan ceramic tiles, etc.  Here's the full re-do we did Bathroom Remodel Reveal  As part of the remodel we installed a new tub and the shower walls we did with three vinyl walls. We were on a tight budget/short on time for the shower walls. Looked much nicer at the time-We LOVE the window over the tub, lots of natural light! Fast forward-Scale buildupWe decided to invest our Covid $ in the house. The whole Boise valley has very hard water which made this hard to clean after years and years. We tried all kinds of products! I had wanted subway tile but after seeing larger tile we decided to go with that. Large white matte tile (no gloss with hard water) and very light grey grout. Dave and I both decided to have some pros do the install. We thought we just wanted it to be perfect, with re-sale value and all. I also have hand issues, which would have been an issue handling so large heavy much tile, grout, etc. There was an issue with the installer not wanting to look at the job in person and bid, so we did photos and went into the store. We had three three panels, but the bidder thought it was a full shower surround.  On the day of install they realized it. That was good, as the labor went down and speeded up the process! Good news, we saved $800.00! We only have one full bathroom in the house. We will use part of the savings for our next project, the coop/ garden fencing. I was also happy to hear about the new technology that is the epoxy grout. Supposedly lasts forever and should be pretty mildew proof. We choose large 12\" x 24\" matte white Porcelain tile. I had seen this before with light gray grout and loved it! We added a new shower head/rod as well. I deep cleaned the faucet spout and handle/cover and we re-used those. We had planned on having a niche with a shelf put on the back wall, but the studs were too close together. We had planed on adding one heavy, stainless steel shelves to the front corner, decided to add two more to the job for more storage instead-Love the floral patternThe workers (two) removed the panels fast, scraped down the old adhesive, then sanded. I didn't take photos of this since it was a small space and didn't want to freak them out. They sanded and smoothed the walls. They added a water barrier, on top of our cement board, mesh up for the tile-Next tile went up, with spacers-I ran in while they were outWhen they got all the tile up, with spacers, they left for the day. We choose a light gray grout Grout Epoxy listed as Cape Gray. It was darker as first and lightened up as it dried. Here's all the details-Two shelves rear and one frontFront shelfNew hotel style shower rod/headTile around the window, looks much more finished! They drilled thru the very thick porcelain tile into the studs for the rodShelf floated between the tiles As this house was built in the 70's not a surprise when the worker told me the wall wasn't quite level. He had to level the tile by using thicker adhesive/grout. You can see on the edge the gray is wider. I may paint this white. I emailed the grout manufacturer and they said I would have to use an epoxy paint. Will live with it a bit, Dave says it looks fine. They used a white metal edge on the tile, bull nose would have been really expensive! I bought new towels from Ikea since the green ones were pretty well done. Sadly they discontinued their apple green color I LOVED!!! I bought a nice Ikea set of blue ones with some edging- baths sheets, hand towels and wash cloths-I kept the same Ikea shower curtain since it was only a few months old-Shelves work great!I added two Ikea shower hooks under the front shelf to hang things from. I had also bought a basket to match but looks like we won't need it. We may put it right above the edge of the tub on the wall if we take baths. We are more shower people- Art work back upAll in all it came out great! We will be able to maintain this tile easier with the matte porcelain finish. We're looking at the kitchen counter next, time will tell!"},

I did a post about the red screen which was also promptly deleted too, with an email. I could feel my blood pressure rising! Would my entire blog be deleted??? Panic mode. I did back up my blog, although I was worried about the malware issue with that. I posted a help question in the Blogger community saying what happened. I guess it was an error on their part. I did get 2 emails early this morning saying the posts had been re-instated, with a URL, which didn't work. I also got some emails from answers on the Help post. I stumbled on the one recent post (the other from March) and it was in the \"draft\" mode. Glad to find them!

{"title": "Garden Rehab Phase 3, High Lumber Prices = Coop Rehab, Pond Fun! ", "date": "May 11, 2021", "text": "Garden Rehab Phase 3-As part of our garden rehab we went shopping last weekend at Edwards Nursery, which has an amazing assortment of plants. While we do buy some plants at big box stores I really like to go to smaller nurseries that have more variety. I like to mix and match! We went through their perennial section of shade loving plants that can also take some sun. The part of the garden were rehabbing is under our maple tree but does get some filtered light. We decided to go with some different colored flowering and non-flowering plants- \"Lemon Frost\" Nettle, a \"Orchid Frost\" Lamium, Pulmonaria \"Trevi Fountain\", \"Bowles Garden\" Gold Sedge, a Masterwort \"Star of Beauty\" a fern Dryopteris filix-mas \"Parsley\", a \"Stained Glass\" Hosta. We also found a beautiful small \"Ruslyn Pink\" Japanese maple tree. Dave planted the dwarf Alberta spruce first. I posted about the 3 large Arbovitae we got from Costco, those went first!  We already had some Feather Grasses, 2 Boxwoods and the large Bamboo, we Dave moved. Luckily I worked 4 hours of overtime last weekend and brought in a little extra pay for this, which I don't mind. Will help offset some of the costs of what we've been buying. Leftover hardscaping is going to one of our girls this weekend. Dave will move the boxwood near the coop to the right corner after it's gone.  We'll add some bulbs in the fall, I put out some markers, circles cut from a mild jug and stakes-I may choose some Irises and we'll bark dust soon. For a reminder, here's the \"before\" photos-We moved the listing solar lightsDave will fit the flagstone soonThrilled the bamboo survived the move! Dave also moved boxwood to the right That's it so far and we love it! I will be building a small fairy house since they requested one! I got idea here one morning channel surfing-High Lumber Prices = Coop Rehab-We thought about rebuilding our Coop and moving it to a different location in our backyard. The coop is over 10 years old and needed some help. Original post here Coop Re-Do 2013 Dave started pricing lumber and talk about sticker shock! I have been hearing on the news that lumber is up about 35%, which is huge! Previously Dave worked in some jobs where he was able to get free lumber but not so much now. We decided to look at what the coop really needed to be repaired. One thing was the floor,  an elevated section when you first walk in. The wood was sagging and it was obvious it was time to replace it. I was talking to Dave and thought instead of buying a sheet of plywood what if he could get some kind of scrap wood in short pieces and use it for the floor. Wouldn't you know it! He found free (at work) 2 pallets that are made for shipping very, very, very heavy electric motors. These are not your typical pallets, more like 2\" x6\"s! He was able to get two free from work! He basically disassembled them using a Sawzall to cut the nails-Dave cutting nailsRecently I INSISTED he buy some new sawhorses, much safer, they fold up nicelyNice wood pileBig crack in floorNew elevated floor goes in All done!The second part of the rehab of the coop was doing the rest of the floor. We had just had a dirt floor in the coop with the chickens digging in it constantly. One of the problems is they have dug under the edge of the walls, which is weakening the whole structure. Since we had so much hardscaping left form various projects I mentioned to Dave maybe we could just use some of that for the for the coop? The pine shavings would go on top of that. Since the chickens have access to the Garden run year-round there's plenty of dirt for them to dig in there and take dust baths. So Dave started digging out the coop floor including the pine shavings. It was time to clean the coop and add fresh pine shavings anyway so he did it all the same time-Uneven is ok, will be under a thick layer of pine shavings!Chickens had to help dig! I should clarify that Dave is not being coerced into doing projects. Dave loves projects! It was Saturday 8:30 am in the morning and Dave was out digging in the coop! The bricks were  free, they came from the edging of our front yard, that came with the house. We replaced with river stone that we got free. I'm just not a fan of brick garden edging. Over the years we've been able to get free river stone from various sources (legally) so we've been replacing the edging around both yards with those. I love the look, very natural.The last thing for the coop was the wood door. When we built the coop I found the old wood door for $10, but now it was really, really warped. I asked Dave what he thought about buying a used storm door that we could use instead. Something aluminum/lightweight that could either be opened or closed depending on the weather. Dave found the door for $15.00 at the Habitat store. The glass panel comes out for the summer, back in the winter. I'll replace the screen soon. We may have to tinker with the glass panel locks and I may paint it later-So the coop re-do TOTAL was $15.00 and a box of nails, pretty good!  A lot less that $500.00+ for a new coop!  Pond Fun! The ducks have been coming and going, mostly later in the day. I put out some extra wild bird food. They love the small pond! They flew in fast and low over my head 2 days ago before landing in the yard. About gave me a heart attack! So cute though, love them.Nap time"},

He added a few wheel barrels full of soil from our veggie garden-He put the plants from the cold frame in pots, will re-plant some and some going to his work for another project!Rough draft of the garden border-See the ducks?Yesterday we bought a Japanese Maple and some shade loving perennials to plant in the area. We may add a really small pond to the area, not sure yet.We hope to have it all planted and bark dusted in the next week or so. Looking better all ready with the green along the fence! Next he removed the big Bamboo and moved it to under the maple tree to fill in the space. Luckily it had a shallow root system! Bamboo gone, more sun to plant more veggies, just need to weed! New home!New Feathered Friends!Last week a pair of wild Mallard ducks showed up in our backyard. I put out some extra wild bird food for them and gave them their space. They've been in the backyard all day today, except for a short period of time. They forage, swim in the pond, drink and sleep. I'm wondering if they'll build a nest? I read if they hang around they may already have a nest. Time will tell. They're quiet and pretty tame. Dave mowed and he said they stayed within about 5 feet. Nice shots, makes me smile when I look out and see them. A good reminder why we have an organic backyard, no worries for them! Mr. Handsome! Dinner timeHeading to the pondAnd the pond repair tape worked!!! Lots of info here on wild Mallard ducks Audubon.orgOld Cedar Planter Rescue-Dave built me a nice cedar planter years ago. The wood was split and rotting, time for a re-do! We took out the plants that wintered over. Dave bought some new cedar and he re-used the galvanized metal-Last he added the metal sheets and the old soil-I re-planted the old herbs and added some new ones! We should be good for a few more years.Bye-Bye Technology –We bought a laptop last year since we were still working off of Windows 8 and it wasn't really being supported much anymore. We reached the point where we couldn't do TurboTax or banking securely.  The computers we had were also really, really sloooooooowwwww. So we decided to buy a laptop, with an adapter, so that we can also use a regular PC monitor with a wireless keyboard and mouse. I backed everything up to the nth degree and it works great! We decided to keep the two old hard drives just in case we forgot something. We decided we reach the point of being happy with where we are at. I pulled out the two hard drives and removed the memory chips from both of them. We retired them both to a local PC recycler, who work with lots of government agencies, schools, etc. I removed the chips since I knew how to. I had actually added some for additional memory. They did lots of good years of service but it was time for them to be retired, haha. Freed up some extra room in my craft closet and under my kitchen desk/counter. I was able to sweep and mop under it and looks nice and open! Bye bye!  Before shots, black hard drive and printer gone"},

We had seen some repair products on TV as and decided to do some research. Dave went to Ace Hardware and was able to buy some Flex Tape as well as the liquid version. Since Dave was able to find the exact leak spot (hopefully) he decided to start with using the tape-Link to the pond (before flagstone install) where you can see the shape Early shot of our pond  He cleaned off the plastic and let it dry and cut a piece big enough to hopefully cover everything and seal really well-We let it dry overnight. Dave filled it tonight, we'll see how it looks the next several days. If that doesn't fix the leak he's going to coat the entire inside with a Flex Seal \"paint\" material. If that doesn't work we're going to buy pond liner and do the whole thing. We love the pond so much! Our neighbors do as well, since one of ours told us that he loves listening to the sound of the water running in the summer from his deck. We were lucky enough to get the pond and a pump at a yard sale several years ago really cheap. We did eventually buy a second pump as well as some other sprayers. Once the weather warms up enough we'll buy water lettuce and fill it in.  Nice calm area right by our deck when we come out.Phase one- Dave and I shopped around and found a great deal at Costco for Emerald Arborvitaes. They were $25.00 each, 4' tall, much cheaper than anyone else. They kept selling out, so we had to go back. One guy in front of Dave bought 12! I had wanted Bamboo but couldn't find what I wanted. While I'm not a fan of these shrubs (WAY overused commercially IMO) I decided they would be a goof fit for the space-Also bought a Dwarf Alberta Spruce for another spotThe previous shrubs were basically for privacy from the house behind us- BeforeFirst we called DIG LINE! You can see the orange paint above on the ground. Luckily we had enough space without killing anything. The new shrubs will get taller and about 4' wide, we can prune if needed. The GREAT thing is they will be green year round! No more brown fence all winter long. Se here was the process. Dave started by pruning the old shrubs down to the ground with hand clippers-More cutting with pruning shears-Down to the big woody base. Dave used an ax, a pry bar and then a chain saw on the bigger pieces-All three planted, will mulch and bark dust soon-Dave straightened the middle one tonightDave will tear out the rest of the cold frame soon. Next will be the new garden. This is the basic garden plan that will be in front of the shrubs-More info here Our Garden Re-HabMore coming soon!StuffSpring Cleaning Spices & Organizing Kitchen Cabinets- I have been watching some YouTube videos on organization and minimizing lately. It's inspiring! They can also suck you into a black hole as I have found. One woman does videos of mopping her home over and over again. Put me to sleep... Anyway, I digress.  I've been reorganizing a few little areas here and there. One of the things I really needed to do was take everything out of part of my upper food kitchen cabinet to see what I had. I realized that some of my spices were probably old and lost their potency. I also knew I had some duplicates. In the interest of minimizing I decided to take everything out and see where I was at, see photo above-Misc Stuff That didn't take too long and I laid everything out then I cleaned off my rotating Lazy Susan things. Hit them with a hot soapy sponge and wiped down the shelves as well. When it was all over I was able to throw out some old spice's, recycle some empty glass spice jars, and wound up with lots of extra room. Now I can really see what I have! Before shots- After- I also organized some of our new smoothie ingredients and moved the blender over by the sink. I've tried Goji berries and Beet powder added to fruit and protein powder.  Gave me more energy! Nice to have it all organized to see what's there. I like the jars better than bags. Both of us are wanting to eat healthier and I've been craving more fruit smoothies with protein powder in it. I've got a few extra supplements that I bought that I had heard of add.  I also re-organized the inside freezer (chest freezer in the garage).  I found some things with freezer burn which I tossed and then I re-organized. Everything was kind of mixed together. Now fruits and nuts on the left for baking and smoothies, everything else on the right. Much better!!! If video on your side doesn't work you may need to turn off your pop-up blocker1949 Step Saving Kitchen Video-I stumbled on this and wow, they had some good ideas back then!

{"title": "Crazy Weather Week, Low Cost/ No Tools DIY Wood Risers! Adding & Re-Habbing House Plants", "date": "Apr 10, 2021", "text": "Time to fill the pond! Crazy Weather Week-It has been a crazy weather week! We had some family over for Easter breakfast, very fun! Our Grandsons River (right) and Oliver (left) were really excited when Dave filled the pond. He also turned on the pump! River kept asking \"where's the water?\" Funny what kids love to watch, a hose filling a pond. Weather was great! We've had some real temperature swings here that have been pretty insane. Last Saturday it was almost 85 Degrees, talk about summer weather. Then the temperature plummeted almost 35 degrees in a day and a half. Then back to the low 60s for the highs, Thursday was only 52 and very windy. April can be like that, definitely not quite summer. This next week is supposed to moderate a little bit of wind, with a high today of 60 and a low of 25! It's one of those weeks where you don't quite know what to wear, flannel shirts or tee shirts. I work from home but I still sort of dress for work, sort of. A lot of days I wear track pants and flannel blouse when it's cold, when it's a little warmer I wear leggings and a cotton blouse. There were two days this week where I had to change my shirt because I was too cold! Anyway here's a few things I have been up, I hope you enjoy it!Low Cost/ No Tools, DIY Wood Risers!I had been browsing Etsy at one point and noticed they were selling these little wood risers like these-Raw woodRaw woodThey were $15.00 to $ 25.00! Knowing what I do about wood and crafts I decided to look for something similar to make my own! Great thing about this is no tools required!!!  I found Joann's Fabrics woodworking section. They had round wooden plaques/discs and round knobs for feet. I knew that I had some left over chalk paint at home and it kind of got me thinking. The plaque was about $5 / $6 and a small bag of the wooden knobs for eight feet was about $4.00. So here's what I did-First I lightly sanded the plaque, with routed edges, then flipped it over to space the feet. Since it was smaller I only used three-I marked the spots for the feet, then I painted the disc with gray chalk paint and let dry. Next I glued the feet on the bottom, using wood glue. That stuffs really bonds! I let dry, then gave them a coat of clear poly. I had five knobs left over from the bag so I added four to a log slice I already had. Got it at Michael's several years ago, about $10.00, about 9\" wide. I spaced them, then glued and let dry-Love it! So the whole thing was less than $10.00 for both risers! Love them. Nice thing about this projects is all the different things you could do customized them- paint, stain, add textures like rope, buttons, etc. Components here-                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Adding and Re-HabbingHouse Plants-I had been wanting to add a plant to my home office and rescue one that was already in there. They help clean the air and are nice to look at! One is a nice, new fern I found at a big box store. I had an Ikea pot on hand, added gravel, then planted. It loves the light! Next I bought a pot and another plant, sits behind me-Next I had a very old, funky hanging plastic pot and the plant was pretty sick. I dumped the pot (falling apart), got a new pot, added fresh potting soil and it seems to be coming back! On my little Easter tableNext I had a sick Ivy, I took it out of the large pot and it's now under the grow light in the bedroom, sorry no pic. The huge Trader Joe's Amaryllis Garden Ivy I kept from 2 winters ago got moved into that pot-Last I put this last winter T Joe's Ivy into an Ikea pot I had on hand in our bathroom, where the plant above was. I basically swapped them to more appropriate pots sizes- At Costco I got a Lavender topiary to go outside, but the weathers been too crazy, so it's inside on the dining table-I also got a 3-pack of plants from Costco, 2 went to my girls at Easter, I kept this one! This lucky bamboo I've had for years. The plastic pot was yucky with hard water build-up so I got a ceramic one for less than $10.00 at Lowe's-I also bought an Olive bush at Trader Joe's, will set outside when it warms up-Anya was supervising my photo shoot-"},
{"title": "Garden Re-Hab Begins! ", "date": "Mar 29, 2021", "text": "Garden Re-Hab Begins!We had rain last week, pouring rain, 37 degrees. Yesterday it was 75, then a cold front came thru last night, coming in with 65 mph gusts, then back to 29 degrees this morning!  Nice to be able to have lots of fresh air when the weather's warmer! This last weekend we started our backyard garden rehab, here's a few things we will be doing. We will re-use/recycle as much as we can, as usual!  *Check newer posts for the photos of completed areas! *Phase One- The west side of our backyard fence takes the brunt of bad weather coming in, as well as the large dogs of the renters who live behind us jumping on it. I could go on about the different people who've lived there, but the people are pretty nice right now. The dogs not so much. They're the kind of dogs that bark all day long on and on randomly. My fantasy was that the house would come on the market, Dave and I could buy it, and create a cohousing situation with one of our kids and family. Not to be and we don't have the money for that anyway. I digress! So Dave found three broken posts-rottedWe didn't want the whole fence to collapse obviously, especially with dogs on one side and our chickens on the other, that would not be a good idea! Behind the coopPreviously when we had put posts in the ground we used gravel and then a layer the concrete. The problem was when the posts broke you have to dig out all the concrete. There's some nice post brackets you can buy now, about $20.00 each with the bolts-It's a bit of an investment but once you put the post in the bracket and set it in concrete, you're done. Just level and brace until it's set up.  The advantages if the post itself ever breaks you simply unbolt,  pop out the post and add a new post into the bracket! No more busting out concrete. So we decided to invest in three and it works great! We did re-use the fence clips on the stringer boards, since they were fine-I helped Dave cut the 4\" x 4\" to size and level the posts once they were in the hole. Once they were shored up Dave poured the concrete and let it sit overnight. Problem solved, nice solid fence again! So that was Phase 1. We saved the 6' old posts to shorten and use in a garden fence project.Phase Two-  The raised bed, which is rotting and pretty unsightly. I found that I can grow the vegetables in another sunnier area. I looked out one day and I thought this is just an ugly view (see top picture too) to look at every single day-Bamboo and 2 Boxwoods will be re-located hereLots of hardscaping materials in the right corner Bear with me here I will get to the point of this. I was channel surfing one night and caught the last 15 minutes of a movie called Dare To Be Wild- Trailer I was fascinated by the story, really got hooked and so I bought the DVD used on eBay. I highly recommend this movie, if you love to grow things! It is based on the true story of Mary Reynolds, the youngest competitor in the British Chelsea Flower show. She created a totally natural design that looks like something in the Irish meadows in the forest. It was totally unlike anything anyone had done before there, she won first place!!! She became an international sensation and is now listed as one of the top 10 garden designers of all time. She has also moved into Permaculture work more recently. Lots of great interviews with her on Youtube. Here's her award winning design-Celtic SanctuaryAfter I watched the whole movie (which I absolutely loved), I got her book from the library. It's called The Gardening Awakening, Designs to Nurture Our Land & Ourselves (she's working on a second book) :Mary Reynolds websiteI looked at some of her designs and they're just amazing. Lots of curves. I flipped through the book one day and spotted this design and that was my Eureka moment!With our square house, sitting in our square backyard, and the square fence a circular design would be perfect! We will modify it to fit the space with our hardscaping on hand. We have bricks, river stones, pavers and some Flagstone. Since we already had a pile of hardscaping leftover from various projects, and that we acquired for free, I thought we could do a nice semicircle. I decided to go ahead and grow different plants, flowers, an evergreen tree and herbs in this area, since it gets partly shade. Create some habitat for the birds and critters, something soothing. So basically we will remove the cold frame, add some hardscaping to create the curves. We also have two Boxwoods to be moved and a Bamboo-Behind the maple treeIn the chicken shade areaIn the sunny veggie areaWe're going to plant the bamboo and the boxwoods between the maple tree and the spiral to fill in the space. I'm wanting to get some bamboo that's tall for privacy screen against our fence, but haven't found any yet (sold out) , I will keep looking. Taking out the cold frame soon to start the process! The sunny bamboo area will be to grow more veggies and food, better se of the space. More coming...Phase Three- The Garden on the south side of the house which has been problematic-Solarizing the soil over the winter to kill weedsWe've had some luck with green beans there, some with corn or squash, but very inconsistent- I thought the best use of the area might be for pollinators garden. I might have Dave build a little bench in there, a kind of a quiet place to go sit. Since it faces south I can do lots of  my new seeds of Rainbow Echinacea, Rainbow Zinnias, Rainbow Yarrow, Milkweed Also some Lavender, Poppies, Salvias, Dwarf Russian Sage (just found those!) maybe some sunflowers. It's a blank slate! Maybe add a birdbath. I want a nice naturalized, low maintenance area... Phase 4-  The chicken run/garden fencing, which is also rotting and falling apart. We used mostly recycled lumber last time, and we got quite a few years out of it. We'll re-use the posts Dave replaced, since we can cut them down. Dave found some wire panels we may buy. Slightly flexible and a nice, clean look. Maybe stock/hog panels. I'm hoping we can run cedar across the tops. Dave may build a new gate. I'd like a metal one that won't get chewed! We thought about relocating the coop to where the cold frame is, but lumber prices have gone way up. We decided not to go that route this year. The coop is in pretty good shape, but it does eat up some of our sunny garden area. Just one of those compromises you got to make. So we will start from scratch with tearing all of this out and re-doing it-Sloppy chicken wire for my flying hens! Safety firstNote marks on gate on the left, squirrels chewing! Will add larger gate and remove boxwoodGirls had to come say hi!Luna and DebbieSunnyRosie the matriarch, soon to be 7!"},

Almost all of them have absolutely nothing to do with anything that really interests me or has to do with this blog. I usually just hit the delete button. But then I got an email from Photowall US. I thought I recognized the name so I looked them up. From Sweden, I thought oh yeah, I've seen them before! If you're a Jonna Jinton (Swedish blogger) fan they sell some of her amazing phots! Photowall Jonna Jinton  After I spent quite a while on their website I decided to email them back. Basically they offered me a free print in exchange for a review and a link on my blog. They gave me a link for my readers to get a discount if you'd like to order (if not that's okay too). I'm not making any money out of this, just a freebie that I got to review and keep. So first I had to figure out what to order. Ironically right before I got this email I had decided to take my current dining room print down and replace it with something, but I didn't know what-Goodwill scores years ago, Italian/French-ishI plan on keeping this print, will put back out in the fall. So Eureka! I measured the print (about 24\") to get something about the same size, on a frame. I was on their website quite a bit and got it down to five choices-With the light wall background I decided we needed to get something with a pop of color since most of the ones I liked where a bit too beige-ish. Dave and I went for the blue! I placed my order, about 5days later I got a nice slim package from Sweden! They had a nice video showing how to assemble the canvas on the frame on their website-First I got out a card table, covered with a bit of wrapping paper (had some sticky spots on it) laid everything out-Nice substantial wood frame! No tools needed, great directions.  A nice wall hook is included.I laid everything out and started with the frame. Just peel tape off the sticky edge, line up and attach the canvas (face side down)-I worked my way around-All four frame pieces attached! On with the braces-No tools needed, just screw in the large thumb screws-I could see I should have gone in about an 1/8th of an inch, but I can live with it-All done and we love it!!!If you'd like to order here is the discount code that you can use: littlehomesteadinboise2021. This code will give you a 25% discount on any product on the website, and is valid for a month!Happy Spring!!!

{"title": "Spring Has Sprung! Surgery Recovery, Happy Saint Patrick's Day!", "date": "Mar 16, 2021", "text": "Spring Has Sprung!It's been like Spring here, in the 60's and bulb/ flowers and more are coming up. It's been great to have the windows open later in the day since it's still been cold in the morning. The weather we're having is cold (30's/40's) in the morning and 62+ in the afternoon. Nice weather! It's crazy to see the heavy snow not too far from us and into the Midwest! My husband has some co-workers who were buried in Denver with two + feet of snow that was really hard to get cleared out by the city. Bummer! We have big garden renovation coming soon, on a budget of course! Going to re-locate some things and re-purpose. We have to make tough choices about what works, what takes too much time for the pay out. Resiliency and flexibility are key when you don't have much room. More to come! Happy Tooth in RetirementSurgery Recovery-My surgery went really well as has the recovery. It is a bit disconcerting when you hear that snap of a tooth coming out! After 3 injections of Novocain I was definitely numb. The dentist and the tech did a great job, have me under a blanket. I was definitely kind of rocky coming out though. I was glad I had Dave drive me both ways since it was disconcerting and a bit stressful. The first hour and a half was the worst after the surgery, since you have to bite down on a piece of gauze. I was able to get off pain meds the next day which was great! They definitely made me feel loopy. I've just been on OTC Ibuprphen and chewing on my other side for now. The great thing is as I can eat regular foods now.  No swelling which was really nice and I did some preventive measures for that. So thank you for all the nice posts and sending me some nice energy, it all helps!Happy Saint Patrick's Day!Since I'm part Scotch-Irish I always celebrate the holiday. Luckily I had the foresight to put up my Saint Patrick's Day decor the night before my dental surgery! It's nice to have all my green things out. I was able to make Saint Patrick's Day dinner Sunday since I was feeling better. I always do corned beef and this year I did it in a crock pot. I always buy a square cut since it's a lot leaner than the tri cuts. I will say that meat prices have definitely gone up, I don't remember paying almost $7 a pound before! I always cook mine with several cloves of garlic crushed, black peppercorns, mustard seeds, and a bay leaf. It came out nice and tender and served with Yukon Gold potatoes, carrots, and cabbage. Since Dave did the grocery shopping for me I had not been able to pick out the meat myself. He got a really small piece. I sent him back today to get another piece since we ate it all over two nights! I was able to get up to Trader Joe's yesterday after work and get some really nice Irish Soda bread. That was a treat, moist with caraway seeds and raisins. Hope you all have a nice holiday if you celebrate it, if not you can go celebrate some Spring weather if you're having some."},
{"title": "Bye Bye Molar! ", "date": "Mar 12, 2021", "text": "Anya says- No I can't watch!Bye Bye Molar! So after going through my process with the two dentists we realized that we were going to have to pull my back molar. I'm having that done tomorrow morning. Basically I had the infection inside the old root canal from my tooth being cracked just a tiny bit. I did a week of antibiotics which seemed to help quite a bit. I was put on an antibiotic I never used before called Clindamycin. I had a really odd side effect as in I lost my appetite and got really lethargic. In the past taking antibiotics I've never had this happen. So tomorrow I will tell my dentist to put a note in my chart I will not be using that ever again. Soon as I went off of it my energy started coming back and I got my appetite back. I did make sure I was eating protein and drinking plenty of water. It was really weird to sit down to a meal take about five bites and go I'm done. Anyway it's bye-bye molar tomorrow. We'll see how I do for a few months and then I may have a dental implant done to replace the tooth. Luckily I have zero co-pay on my dental insurance! I will be resting and doing ice on my cheek this weekend and hopefully it won't be too bad. Netflix here I come. Send me some good energy please, thank you!!!"},
{"title": "The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly", "date": "Mar 3, 2021", "text": "Look at those big teeth! The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly-This title best sums up my last two weeks! They're not in any particular order as far as how things have been going, and why I have not been posting until today. Hopefully this post will make sense since I am currently on painkillers! Weather has been great, 60 degrees today! So...I was having trouble sleeping starting about 2 weeks ago and was getting more and more tired. I have sleep apnea but it is very well controlled with a dental device. I started waking up more at night, tossing and turning, and was thinking maybe I needed to get a replacement dental device? That was the ugly part. I then realized what was really keeping me awake with my IT band along my left thigh. I did some stretching and heat and a few other things. Went to bed that night and slept really great! I did a couple more nights in a row and problem solved, got my energy back.I decided to bite the bullet and bought a nice L.L. Bean down parka online. Mine was toast from 25+ years of use.  It arrived and it was too big, which was pretty aggravating. So I shipped it back for a smaller size and called to follow up a week later. I was told it was out of stock. Bummer! The next day I found the exact same parka new on eBay for about $120 less. That's a lot of money but I wanted one that was going to last. The reason this one was so inexpensive is there was a small repair done on it, done very professionally, doesn't really show. Beautiful! I called L.L.Bean the next day after getting an email saying my replacement had shipped. I told them I had said to cancel my order and they said oh it's already shipped. I was not happy since I told them the day before to cancel the order. Luckily it turned out it actually had not shipped and they were able to cancel it. I got the eBay new parka really cheap, in the right size. It arrived yesterday and fits great!Sunday night we were having dinner and I noticed my bottom rear molar was a little sensitive. The next morning not much. Mid-morning yesterday I was speaking and it felt like an ice pick went through my jaw! It only went downhill from there. Luckily I had called in first thing in the morning to get an appointment with my dentist but it was at 5 p.m.. I didn't want to wait with this excruciating pain the whole day, so I called back and they got me in at 9:30 a.m. today. I visited with the dentist and the first thing he did was give me a shot of Novocaine, since I had only gotten about 2 or 3 hours of sleep from the constant throbbing all night. The Novocain kicked in and suddenly my mouth felt fairly normal. I'd had a root canal done about 20 or more years ago and they felt there was possibly an infection down in there. They gave me a referral to a root canal specialist down the street. Part of me was thinking how much is this going to cost! I went to my car after the exam with my prescriptions for pain pills and antibiotics and I called the other dentist's office. They said miraculously they had just had a cancellation and could I come over right away? I said I will be there in 5 minutes and I was. The short version was they felt it was either an infection in the root canal or the tooth was cracked.  They asked me if I wanted to do a 3D Dental x-ray before I left or at the appointment? For some reason I thought we should do it right then. The Dentist came back in and said well we have a big change. He showed me the X-ray and there was a big infection down in there and looked like the tooth is cracked. He said we were lucky that we did the 3D x-ray then to catch it. So I called my other Dentist back and have surgery set up for next Saturday morning. So as much as I don't like having a tooth removed there's not any other option. The good news is I have really good dental coverage! 0% copay. I can see how I do further down the line and maybe can get a dental implant if needed, to help my chewing. My wonderful dentist actually offered to do the surgery today but I said no, not on 2 or 3 hours sleep thanks. So I started my antibiotics which should help a lot in the next 24 hours or so and some pain meds so I can sleep. I will say it was one of the more whirlwind dental experiences I have ever had, and definitely the worst dental pain I have ever had, a strong 10 +. OMG.Next Dave and I decided to get a exercise bike after I found out I have arthritis in both knees. My ortho doctor recommended an exercise bike since it's non-weight-bearing instead of the treadmill we were thinking about getting. We did a lot of research through Consumerreports.org, only $10.00 a month to subscribe. We found a Schwinn A10 exercise bike at a store that we liked that was $400. We figured it would be a good investment in our health since we both need to lose weight. While we were there looking at it I noticed another exercise bike in the other row across from it with a little tiny price tag on it. It was $250. We both tried it it worked great, it's smaller and easier to move around the house. It's also nice and quiet. The other day on my lunch break I got on the exercise bike and did 10 minutes and it works great! When my TV kept dropping the internet signal, it turned into a router issue with my work computer. Short version, after multiple phones calls and a visits from a tech it's all now working fine. Zero cost, just a few hours of my time lost. So those are the highlights of my 2 weeks. How is your week going?"},

Simple Classic Chili", "date": "Feb 15, 2021", "text": "Using Tattered Angels Water Based-Wood Tint-The new snow is melting a bit and birds are out in force! I put out some food this morning-And my November bulb finally bloomed! Almost like a touch of Spring! I never got around to posting this project so this is a good time. I bought a Ikea Moppe little chest online several months ago. I sat it aside because I wasn't quite sure what to do with it-Ikea.com Moppe I thought about painting it or staining it or something else? I was in Hobby Lobby where I ran across this product that I never seen before. It's Tattered Angels Color Wash Tint, which is water-based!!!Hobbylobby.comIt comes in lots of different colors and I suddenly thought that might be the perfect solution! I wanted something sheer, so the wood grain would show,  but something with a little bit different finish. This was just the ticket! For $3.00 a bottle I bought two figuring that would be enough, which it was. I have about 3/4 of a bottle left. So here's how you use the tint and I have to say I really love the way it came out. The pictures don't really do it justice. First I chose the Weathered Copper Verdigris color. It's green with very fine Copper powder mixed in. No odor, simple soap cleanup. First I laid out some scrap wood and did a test drive-I did one coat, then the top section with 2 coats. Didn't like the 2 coats mode personally.Nice and sheer!Note the Copper powderI laid out plastic bags to paint on top of. With the Copper powder you need to keep stirring and mixing!This project was so simple I'm not going to put a lot of directions here. Basically the manufacturer recommends using a brush, so do not use a sponge brush, but one with bristles. I found with the Copper powder you don't want to over-brush or you move the powder around too much. Just let it soak in. So basically you want to use a light hand. I used about a 2\" wide craft brush, and clean up is a breeze since it's just soap and water!Here we go-I did all the sides, in case I decided to add knobs or pulls later-Since it is a water-based tint the manufacturer recommends using some kind of a polyurethane sealer, which I did. I used clear Varathane with a satin finish. I did use a sponge brush, because I didn't want to have to use mineral spirits to clean up. It didn't seem to affect the tinted finish at all, Copper powder stayed put. Dried in a hour or less, but a little smelly. I had to do indoors since it was so cold out- Love it!!!Cute ceramic mitten napkin holder! $2.00!Thrifting Scores! We dropped off some donations a few days ago, and scored some fun things! First  I found a set of four prints, oak frames, nice matting! $1.00 each, about 9\" by 9\". Two frames had a little wear, Old English took care of that! Will probably put over the dining table in the summer, in a grid- The clerk put them in a nice, new (donated) insulated bag! Free!

I made this on a cold, snowy afternoon, perfect! Here's a basic recipe I used, and you could use black beans instead, or ground turkey. You could add bell peppers, Jalapenos, etc. Recipe-1 TBL Olive oil, 1 medium white onion diced, 1 pound lean ground beef2 1/2 TBL Chili powder (or to taste), 2 TBL Ground Cumin, 1 TBL Garlic powder, 1 1/2 TSP Salt, 1/4 TSP ground Cayenne pepper to taste, 1 TSP Chipotle powder to taste1 1/2 cups beef broth, 1 -15 oz. can  diced tomatoes, 1- 16 oz. can Kidney beans, drained and rinsed2 TBL tomato pasteAdd oil, meat and onion to pot, brown, then add spices, beans and tomatoes.

{"title": "Making Irish Ballycotton Fish Chowder & Spotted Dog Soda Bread", "date": "Feb 1, 2021", "text": "Photo from cookbook Making Irish Ballycotton Fish Chowder & Spotted Dog Soda Bread-I'm part Scotch/Irish and have wanted to explore some traditional cooking.  I'd run across some recipes by the author Rachel Allen with some really classic Irish Family Foods, but ones that were a bit healthier-I bought a used copy of her book on eBay. After browsing a bit the first one I decided to try was her Ballycotton Fish Chowder (named after her village).  I really liked the fact it didn't have just dairy is the base for the liquid since Dave and I have to take it easy with dairy products. It has a lot of chicken stock in the chowder, but no chicken flavor. This was actually a fairly inexpensive dish to make. I did use some smoked salmon that I found on sale, ditto some small salmon fillets and the Whiting fish I used is also pretty reasonable. We already had some bacon in the freezer, milk, fresh herbs and potatoes. I made a double batch so we'd have some leftovers. I was really tempted to put in some finely diced celery and carrots but decided to follow the recipe instead. This is hands-down the best seafood soup I have ever made ! It was actually pretty easy just a lot of dicing of the potatoes. Really wonderful flavor, cook's pretty fast since you're cooking small pieces of fish. The recipes pretty flexible too.  I used Whiting because it was easy to find but you could use the other recipes listed like the Pollock, Haddock or Cod listed. Garnish with crispy bacon and fresh herbs! Nice on a chilly night!  I also wanted to try Rachel's recipe for Spotted Dog Soda Bread  which is basically Irish soda bread with raisins. Hers is a little bit different because it does not use any butter, which is very traditional. Instead she uses an egg. I did substitute 1 cup of WW Pastry flour for the white flour, a little healthier! Next time will use just the WW. The bread had a nice crunchy exterior and very, very moist inside. It also keeps really well. I had a slice today with my morning tea break and it was great! I'm looking forward to trying more of her recipes."},

I saw the forecast for the Sierra Nevada mountains:6'-7' of snow and up to 90 mph winds! CRAZY!!! Stormy, but no snow here, but quite a bit in the mountains, up to a foot or more. We're having high winds, very cold then now up to 48! It's been very gray and I am ready for either some snow or springtime!Too early to plant out here though the ground still really cold and hard. So here's what we've been up to lately! We've been busy-1. Plant Something-Too early but I'm thinking about starting some seeds soon. 2. Harvest Something-We've been getting a nice steady supply of fresh eggs from our new hens! I have been giving my kids some of the extras. They are so good!!! 3. Preserve/Store Something-Bought some local Artisan breads at the grocery outlet and froze them. Stocked up on some cheese's and fish.  4. Manage Reserves- Get a Good Deal/Barter/Stock Up/Prep-Save quite a bit of money buying our new electric tea kettle instead of replacing our Keurig. We are using up the Keurig pods up by putting the contents in a mesh coffee filter inside a bamboo tea strainer. Dave does drink coffee so he's working on those. I'm strictly black tea! I bought him some fresh beans today! Cost Plus had a nice selection.  5. Eat the Food- Try New Foods/Recipe-I have a new Irish fish stew recipe I'm going to dry along with some Irish soda bread. I made some Irish soda bread with currants recently but we'll make the more traditional with raisins. I bought a new cookbook on Irish cooking that looks really great! I got a low-cost used copy on eBay-I'm also going through some recipes through a library book that I got on cooking in the Alps-I decided to buy some British tea treats for something and different. I had been eating a granola bar mid-morning on work days and got really bored, plus they are so overpriced. Not that enthused to make my won. I thought tea biscuits might be up my alley! Here's my first batch. I bought some Green/Jasmine tea (couldn't find locally) great with Asian food! All from The English Tea StoreThe Hob Nobs are addictive! The Highland Oat Crackers great with a little cheese. Mega Creams cookies are really nice. The \"world famous\" Eccles Cakes, stuffed with raisins and currants, were disappointing. Off taste, may try and make my own version. The second batch of treats I found at Cost Plus World Market today. I bought more biscuits, mustard, and made in Britain beans in a light tomato sauce. It's a traditional food, canned beans in tomato sauce, and many people serve them on toast for breakfast! It seems to be a tradition from WWII during food rationing, for protein. They're not the U.S. barbeque beans with a lot of sugar. Will report back on the flavor. I found Maldon's Welsh sea salt, after I saw this on a travel show this morning, crazy find! I decided to start doing more whole grain baking lately. It's getting hard to find some whole grain Italian Breads and we're trying to eat less processed foods. I found some recent recipes so we'll try those and share the ones that come out well! 6. Build Community Food Systems-Nothing yet too early for farmers markets. 7. Recycle/Re-Use-I went through our holiday things and donated quite a bit. Also donated some extra kitchen decor, bedding and a few other things. Bought several things on eBay and at local thrift stores. With covid I have not been going to thrift stores nearly as often. In my last post you can see all the cool thrift store items I got recently Thrifting Scores x 3!  8. Skill Up-I learned recently about the history of the Union Jack Flag in the United Kingdom-Info here Wikipedia.orgI'm part Scotch-Irish and had recently been looking into making some traditional British foods and snacks. I hope to go to the UK someday and see everything!!! 9. Regenerate What is Lost/Salvage Something-I have a house plant that really needed a new pot and some fresh soil since it was failing after about 10 years-For a couple bucks I bought a new pot and a fresh bag of potting soil. I replanted it and put it in the kitchen where we get a little bit more sunlight-I also bought another plant and pot at the same time. Now in my office-Another plant I bought a while back I finally transplanted into a fun steel pot I bought it Ikea months and months ago. It's nice to have a couple of plants in my home office! I read that having plants in the workplace actually increase your productivity by up to 15%. Wow I should tell my boss how exciting! I am so bored with my work I cannot even begin to tell you. I'm hoping to be cross-trained soon because my brain is just bored and my work is too repetitive. Pretty soon we will be doing some dormant oil spray on our organic apple tree. Then we will do some Copper spray on our organic Peach tree to limit the rust disease. With our first Covid stimulus check I had bought some insulated curtains for my office.  I realized I needed to tie them back otherwise it was a little too closed. I just use some string at the time and kind of forgot about it. I finally bought some minimal burlap looking ribbon, goes with the fabric okay. I bought a couple of cup hooks and put those in to have something a little bit nicer than push pins. A pretty cheap upgrade-At the same time I also bought some cranberry colored ribbon to replace the string on my Christmas quilt's rod. Already packed away so you'll see it next year. I found at a thrift store, added a rod on the top and hung it-"},

With four day weekend (took 2 days vacation) it was the perfect time! With the new tea kettle and Keurig being retired it was also a time to look at the function of the area.  Our kitchen is not that big, with a built-in dining area. Basically sink with counter on both sides, then range with small counter on one side. That's it! We do have a built in desk that came with the house. I'd love to remove it and replace with a buffet, maybe some day. Anyway here's one of the before shots-Before- Keurig and Too much stuffNot too badFirst I took everything off each section, and cleaned the backsplash and counter-Behind the toasterUsed very hot water, Dawn and Bartender's FriendSpatters on backsplash-Crud behind the faucet and sink-A sponge did not do the job, but Bartender's Friend and a toothbrush did!All clean! I put back the counter items and the new tea kettle (works great!)-I took down the command hookI moved the DIY topiary to the area by the fridge, liked it better thereTwo new thrifted items added (see below) I liked this as is, it's shallow decor and doesn't use up that much space-Next I cleaned out my big kitchen drawer, before shot-Vacuumed the drawer, had donations and trash. All organized and easy to find things now! I bagged all the cookie cutters, stacked the strainers and biscuit cutters-Next I took out the items below the china hutch and stored where they needed to go-All better! None of this cost anything! I can't tell you how may articles, posts and Youtube videos tells you to buy all this stuff to do this job. Not needed! I have stored a few of the small decorative items. I may donate or put back. Will let some time pass and see if I miss them...Roseville mixing bowlThrifting Scores X 3-I hit three thrift stores in 3 days. I just needed to go browse! Last trip I found this Roseville Friendship pattern mixing bow. Not sure how old it is but it's in perfect shape! $15.00, my splurge. I couldn't date it exactly by research, but I love the craftsmanship!!! I saw a few of this size on eBay and Etsy for about $35.00 or so (without shipping) . I did have an odd interaction going out of the thrift store with a woman I didn't know. She came outside the door and said in a loud voice do you have my Roseville Bowl. I didn't know who she was I didn't know if there was going to be a problem and I just said oh I don't know. I went ahead and put it in the backseat of my car and close the door and she said oh yeah that was my Roseville Bowl. Then she walked off. Day was behind her and looked at me and I looked at him and got in the car. I told him what she said and he said oh you know he she works there. She had on a uniform best which I didn't notice. I don't know if she had her eye on it was going to buy it but apparently she had to say something so what can you do? There can be some interesting people in thrift stores sometimes so sometimes playing dumb is best route I guessIt's on my counter for now-Another trip I scored some really cute holiday decor, $15.00 total-Wall hangerFun winter wood wall decor2 trees, how cute!I donated my other large one the Keurig was on, I may mount to the wall, maybeBasket for our crackers in the cupboardFits perfect! Another trip- this made my laugh so I bought it, $1.00, love the frame! If I ditch the print I could re-use-For Life curved teapot, new these sell for $35.00, got for $3.00! Great for smaller pots of tea, has a nice silicone seal on the lid, doesn't drip. I found out after buying it they sell all kinds of really cool tea pots, love their designs.Nice with silicone lid seal, full of biscotti's for winterI forgot to add this to my last technology update. One of my kids kindly loaned me her CD player/radio when I started working from home last March. I knew I'd be bored to death with nothing to listen to!  Before Christmas she wanted it back. I looked around and found this for $45.00 at Target-. It has FM radio, CD player, wireless to tunes/podcasts off my phone and a head set jack. Works great and it's much smaller! Using Winter Stores-It's so satisfying to bring out some of my home stored foods! This one meal I served- homemade Chow Chow, fermented pickles, home grown organic canned peaches, sale bought chicken breasts. These pickles I have to say are the BEST ever!!! Probably since I finally found some local pickling cukes that were freshly harvested. So crunchy! I also bought the chicken, 1/2 off during summer season. Froze, thawed and roasted with Trader Joe's Honey Aleppo Pepper Sauce with honey. Tangy and slightly sweet it was okay, next time I'd use BBQ sauce instead, too bland for me. I served with brown rice-"},
{"title": "Updating Technology On A Budget, Winter Project Time", "date": "Jan 13, 2021", "text": "New Wind AnemometerUpdating Technology On A Budget-Recently we did some updates of some of our technology, on a budget of course! Our TV was getting a bit old and it always had terrible sound. It was a great deal seven or eight years ago but it was time for something bigger with our aging eyes. We looked around for a while and I had always told Dave I wanted to get something with some decent speakers since I love music! For my birthday in December Dave bought me /us  a new TV! We wanted one that fitted in our existing entertainment center since we didn't want anything too big. I'm not a fan of huge huge televisions. Maybe if I sat around all day and have nothing to do but watch programs, but hey, I have other things to do! We got a great deal at Costco and got a perfect size. It's a Roku Smart TV, and since we already had a Roku stick on the old TV and account it was easy to transition over to it. The sound is amazing!We donated our old TV, hopefully someone will give it a new home! For a Christmas present Dave got me something I have wanted for quite a while. Being the Weather geek that I am Dave got me a La Crosse wireless weather station with an anemometer (solar powered)  or wind measuring device. It's on the top of our house's garage peak! Pretty easy install, works great!   It has a really bright LCD tablet that's easy to read. He also got this at Costco apparently. Truly accurate which is nice and I'm always watching the winds because we can have some pretty severe wind gusts here. That can affect our chickens and the coop and whatever we happen to be growing at the time. It's nice to have the app on the phone too, part of the set up process, which was pretty easy.  Our Keurig coffee maker was on its last legs. We wanted to be more environmentally friendly and David said he really preferred French press coffee anyway. I did some research on electric teaa kettles on Consumerreports.org. You can sometimes find their test results for free. If you ever have to buy a car I highly recommend spending the $5 a month subscribe for 1 month and do some research. We've been super happy with our Mazda hatchback after doing research and buying one. It's 11 years old and has had hardly any problems of all, super reliable. Anyway I did some research and I we bought an electric tea kettle. Some of them are glass, which makes me a little bit wary, if you drop it's dead!  So I went with Consumer Report recommended as a best buy-It's funny some of the most expensive models out there had poor testing results...Some winter kitchen decorWinter Project Time-I decided to take a four-day weekend and work on some projects this week. One of them is deep cleaning my kitchen counter, back splash, my spices, and re-organizing part of my kitchen drawers. Some painting too, reveal coming soon! Good things to do when it's winter! It's been cold, but then we had two days where it was in the low 50's! Almost felt like spring, but back down to the 30's tonight. Dave and I will also be cleaning the coop this weekend replacing the old deep litter Pine shavings with fresh. This method works so well I cannot even tell you! No smell, biodegrades/composts and I only have to clean off the top roosting area about once a week in the winter. In the summer I do it two or three times a week. A bale is about $9.00 locally, with some leftover. We do about 4\"-5\" in the winter-Debbie on the right, Sunny on the leftSunny says what's up!Next going to hit a couple thrift stores on Friday when I'm off look for a couple things. I've been trying to find a simple nice wood twin headboard for our spare bedroom where our grandsons stay. It doesn't have one, want to dress it up a little bit. I'll look to see if there's something cute that I can either rehab or retrofit. If not we make break down and build one-I bought this online from Ikea several months ago, a Moppe Mini storage chest, Birch plywood, 16 ½\" x7\" x 12 5/8 \"-I had plans for it, but kept changing my mind! I finally found the perfect thing to finish it. It's bare wood and I wanted some kind of finish. Will post it when it's done!"},

I decided to make this and see how it went. First I had to convert the measurements to American ones. Then I had to find certain ingredients. I had never worked with Marzipan before and unsalted Pistachios were a bit tricky to find. I will say this was the trickiest dough I've worked with, VERY sticky! It was hard to tell from the photo how big they'd be. I was thinking Danishes, but really more normal bun/biscuit-sized. It was a toss up to use American bread flour or American unbleached. I went with bread flour. I liked the combo of fresh and dried Cranberries, and orange. Here are my calculations on the measurements, feel free to do your own research for conversions. Detailed directions and photos on Rosie's blog- 1.4 cups full-fat milk3.48 TBL butter, chopped into cubes1 and 8/10th cups  bread flour- NOT ENOUGH7g sachet fast-action dried yeast3.5 TBL white and brown sugar mixed,  plus 3 TBL 1 Tsp ground cinnamonSpray oil 7 Oz.  Marzipan, chilled- 1 tube (this is hard to grate!) 1 orange, zested and juiced0.43 cup fresh cranberries0.43 cup dried cranberries, plus 1 tbsp1/3 cup pistachios, chopped3 TBL apricot jam, sieved (I subbed Orange Marmalade) 2/3 cup powdered sugarI think if I made these again I would use quite a bit more flour. I did find several generic sweet dough recipes (see my Pinterest food folder) that might work better. Rosie's photos make the raw dough look thicker and mine rose plenty. It was pretty hard to handle, use LOTS of flour on your board and roller!!! Flavor-wise, excellent and a very different flavor profile.A Bowl Of Christmas Joy-I wanted something different for Christmas Eve dinner so I made beef stew. I used a basic (Martha Stewart) beef stew recipe with red wine. Simpler than the Beef  Bourguignon I had made in the past. I also added mushrooms, the last 15 minutes. It was warm, comforting and a bowl of joy! I served with hot French bread. I doubled the recipe so we had plenty for two dinners and some lunches. I made Molten Chocolate Baby Cakes for dessert, simple, fast and delicious! I used Nigella Lawson's recipe and it's great that you can make the batter ahead of time and chill until you need them  Happy New Year!!!Thanks for all your kind comments this last year, they really helped me feel connected! My family and I have much to be grateful for. Looking forward to this next year and all the exciting projects and adventures!!!"},

{"title": "Restoring Vintage L.L. Bean Maine Hunting Shoes, Thrifting Find", "date": "Dec 9, 2020", "text": "Restoring Vintage L.L. Bean Maine Hunting Shoes-You just never know when you'll run into something you been wanting! I'd been on the lookout for a used pair of L.L. Bean boots. They're pretty iconic, all made in the U.S., old school technology that still works. I gave up ever finding a pair in a thrift store or cheap on eBay. We were in a thrift store recently, I happened to go over to the shoe rack and saw this label-I looked at them, stopped and thought, wait a minute! Maine? I took the boots off the shelf, looked inside and saw this- I thought these were L.L. Bean \"Boots\", but they were Maine Bean Hunting Shoes! These are the very first, original design, not Bean \"boots\". More flexible, thinner soles, more like a moccasin. Info here Wikipedia.org L.L. Bean They were a Men's eight (runs big), so I tried them on. They fit perfect. I didn't see a sticker on the boots and they were on a shelf that said $3 for all shoes, unless otherwise marked. I wandered around for a few other things and took them up to the front desk to pay for them. The woman clerk was upset at the register and said several times they weren't supposed to be out on the floor. She also asked if there was a sticker on them for another price and I said no. I kind of waited for her to veto this purchase but she said okay you're getting them for three bucks. She was not happy. It was obvious somebody made a big mistake there. So I bought them and took them home along with a couple of other things. Here's the before shots- The first thing I did was remove the laces, the insoles and took a good look. Next I cleaned the leather with saddle soap. I washed the rubber on the boots with warm soapy water. I let them dry overnight, here with wet leather-Next I bought some Boot Guard leather conditioner that I had used years ago. The leather was really, really dry and stiff. I folded up a paper towel and started liberally applying it on all of the leather. I had to use my fingers to get in between the gusset under the laces. The gusset is what keeps all the water out of the boots, which is great! This next picture shows the difference after applying half of the conditioner on the leather-What a difference the leather conditioner makes!So both of the boots were done. I waited about an hour and added a second coat. A little later I touched up a few other spots with my fingertipsThe leather softened up quite a bit! Buffed, came out with a nice patina!!!The insoles were shot, stitched leather with something on top that looked like burlap-I bought some black sheepskin liners, with a foam arch support. Fit perfect, warm and cozy! Got new laces, similar to what's used on the L.L. Bean boots. I found out the traditional laces on the Hunting Shoes are plain brown, but I like them! I emailed L.L. Bean and found out these are probably from the 70's /early 80's. I may get them re-done at some point. I could get the whole rubber bottom replaced for about $40.00 Not a big priority right now. The leather might also not be intact enough to re-do anyway. All done, the products I used are listed on the left sidebar. Ready for snow and rain!!! Apparently they are also big for preppy style, who knew? Thrifting Find-When we were checking out with the boots, and a little flatware rack, I spotted this! It was in the glass case, for $4.00! It has multi-color LED lights that rotate the colors. It's about 6\" long. My one Grandson love trains so I got it for our house for him to see. We love trains too however!  It's very bright, the photo was hard to pick that up. Just too cute to pass on! The lights go blue, red, dark pink and green-"},
{"title": "Things I'm Grateful For, Easy Coop Winter Sunroom Upgrade", "date": "Dec 3, 2020", "text": "Things I'm Grateful For- I didn't really have time to do this before Thanksgiving since things were kind of crazy. Dave and I wound up having Thanksgiving by ourselves. We had a small turkey with all the trimmings, apple pie, and some nice appetizers, smoked Salmon, crackers, olives, pickles, meats and cheeses-I have been thinking since summer how grateful I am for how things have been going for us and our family. So for (belated) Thanksgiving here's a few things I'm very happy and grateful for........Both Dave and I have been able to stay fully employed with our jobs through Covid. I started working from home at the end of March, and I'm still working from home. It's nice, but there is a certain lack of communication in my organization. Working from home I think exacerbates that, not a surprise. I do have kitty to keep me company! I have a lovely view, can moderate the heat/cool as needed and it is a truly unscented workplace for me, which is awesome! I'm really grateful that two of my children and one son-in-law got much much better jobs this summer. With better pay and benefits! One was hired into my organization and the other two into a large national insurance company. They all are doing very well in their jobs and the pay raises they got were very helpful, since two of them have children. Kids can be expensive! Our house is doing well. We did have to replace our hot water heater (leaky pipe) recently but we were able to do that ourselves, so that saved a ton of money. It lasted 3 years past it's warranty too! After Dave drained it and we took it down it had 2 big rusted out areas on the back!!! Dave bought it, brought it home and with the help of my daughter put it in a place and it's working great. We saved hundreds and hundreds of dollars not getting it delivered and having a plumber install it. Dave had done it before so it was an easy install-Leaky pipeDave added a heavier steel base and leak tray. Works great! He added earthquake strapping as well. The chickens have done well. We now have a full size flock of five and the eggs kicked in a few weeks ago. They're averaging about two per day with the shorter days, here's the flock! We're happy that we live close to all three of our children. We see our two grandsons off and on which is great, they grow so fast. Oliver will be 4 in December!  River's 4 and 1/2 and doing really well in preschool, yakking up a storm. Oliver is doing great, loving preschool as well, spelling and loves reading! River came by recently, Mom Tami reading to him-The garden did really well this year even though we got a really late start with the weird weather. No peaches sadly,  maybe about 10. We had a really small crop of apples, but the pears did great, enough to can!  I was able to freeze a lot of fresh organic tomatoes in our freezer, pretty full now! I'm a planner! When Covid hit I started buying a few extra meats here and there to freeze. Already used one beef roast-I had a full body skin cancer check-up recently and I was really happy! I was completely clear, except for two little tiny spots on my nose (pre-cancerous). The dermatologist froze them off and hopefully that will take care of it. Dave and I just celebrated our 27th anniversary! I'm lucky to be married to my best friend and he's a outstanding father and grandfather. When I decided to get married I definitely picked the right person!Easy Coop Winter Sunroom Upgrade-We built our coop \"sunroom\" several years ago out of recycled glass panels, shower doors and a custom frame attached to the coop. Basically it gave more room for the chickens in the winter when it was really snowy or pouring rain. After all the years the pressure wood frame started rotting and we talked about what would be a better replacement. The glass was very heavy and it's really awkward to put together. Basically after the winter's was over we could take it down and store it. It did work great for heavy snowy weather! Original-The other downside was it cut off the shade area in the winter, losing a bit more room for the girls. I mentioned this fall that I'd seen some other hoop houses that were used for chickens in the winter. I thought maybe it was time for a simple, low cost, easy re-do. Here's a few examples of my thinking, the first design that really got my attention several years ago- Two photos from Sugar Mountain FarmFrom Makingwillowbend.comDave and I really liked the idea, with it being lightweight, easy to put up/take down, as well as inexpensive.  Dave shopped around and brought home his materials, total about $40.00.  He bought six x 10' long flexible 1/2 \" white PEX tubing (for plumbing), a roll of heavy clear plastic and built a frame base of 2 x 4's we had. First he cleared out the old materials, then recycled them. Next he built a base of 2 x 4's, and attached the PEX to the coop using scrap wood with a hole it it. Next he created the shape. He attached the PEX pieces to each other form the shape with tie wraps and drilled holes in the 2 x 4's. He put the PEX in the holes to brace the PEX-   It reminds me of an igloo! Note the gap on the left, allowing the hens to go behind the coop and have more room to roam-Roll of plastic on the groundNow getting ready to spread out the plastic. We spread it out, he cut it to fit, then stapled it down to the base of the 2 x 4's. It works great! The chickens have been using it in the pouring rain, wind and snow. I can't really see through it since the plastic isn't that clear.  I see them in there moving around and taking dust baths. It's nice to have that extra space when the weather is really nasty. In the spring we can just take it down and it goes back into garden growing space. Lightweight but doing the job!"},

{"title": "And Then There Were Two!", "date": "Nov 18, 2020", "text": "And Then There Were Two!We have a little bit of a warm-up and most of our snow is gone which is been nice. Gray today, windy, then thunder and lighting! We're prepping for Thanksgiving which should be fine hopefully! And now for the BIG news! And then there were two...When I went out today I found Sunny, our flying chicken, sitting in the nesting box area with an egg between her legs! Since she is a Brown Leghorn she has white eggs which I've actually never had before. All of my previous hens had brown eggs. She also has one BIG comb on top! It's redder in real life, just the lighting. I found out that's a genetic thing with this breed. I suspect that the other chicken who's been laying last week is my red Sex Link Debbie, far right-I happened to find her in the coop near a fairly warm eggs, so I suspect it was her but hard to tell. Since I have three new hens I should start seeing three eggs a day soon, depending on how sensitive they are of the short days. Shorter days in the winter change hens hormones so that they lay less to conserve energy. My tow older hens may start laying again, but I'm not expecting that. This is one of the really great exciting things about doing Urban Homesteading!!! You put the time and energy into buying some little chicks, growing them to be healthy young hens and then they start laying fresh eggs for you. It all pays off. Hopefully this flock of five will continue to do well. So far they have really been a good combination and they all hang out together nap together and groom together. I think they have figured out the pecking order! Happy times!"},
{"title": "First Snow! Independence Days Challenge", "date": "Nov 8, 2020", "text": "First Snow! We sure did hit our record low! It warmed back up, with 67 Friday, then the wind kicked in yesterday, Saturday. Rain started late afternoon, then snow I noticed around 10 p.m. At 5:50 am today I saw about 2 \" of SNOW was on the ground, with more coming!  It's 32, still snowing and melting on the ground.  Forecast is more snow this week off and on, cold, 22 degrees tonite. Lots of snow in the mountains, it's a big storm!Independence Days Challenge-We've been busy, and yet the days are shorter, with garden put to bed for the winter. Friday, with the storm coming in, I covered my garden bench with plastic and took down the last of the garden decor to move inside. The patio table and chairs are now stored as well. We're doing a BIG project right now, that will be a separate post! So here's what we've been up to! 1. Plant Something-Not this time of year, garden has been put to bed.  2. Harvest Something-We got an egg yesterday, our first in about 5 months! Either one of our young hens has started laying or one of the older ones started again. Time will tell, but very excited! Looking forward to having our own fresh eggs again, that was always one of my goals. With 3 new hens we should have a good supply of eggs this winter, although it varies with the shorter days-I harvested the last of my Thyme, Oregano and Collard greens-3. Preserve/Store Something-I bought a new Nutrichef freezer bag vacuum machine. I did quite a bit of research before I bought one. Ironically the $55 version I bought at Amazon was a better deal than the same price at Costco. The Costco brand was only 8\" wide on the bags, which isn't very large. This machine goes up to 11\"\". So far I've mostly done fresh produce but we'll start doing meats, etc. when I get a good deals. I hope this will prevent a lot of freezer burn I've had in the past and the reviews were great! Link on left sidebar. For some reason Blogger won't let me put an Amazon link here, just a photo with link, go figure. It's noisy and does take a little getting use to. Took me a couple of tries, but Youtube helped, and it worked great after that. The only thing I had trouble with was trying to bag quartered, dead ripe tomatoes. So much juice came out of the bag it wouldn't seal! Next time, I'd do them whole, that worked fine. It's been working great for storing garden produce! I did a lot of fresh garden tomatoes mixed with sweet peppers and Italian frying peppers- Italian peppers to stuffI made a big batch of pasta sauce with our own organic tomatoes, added sausage and froze half. Good for more dinners. 4. Manage Reserves- Get a Good Deal/Barter/Stock Up/Prep-Went to the farmstead again, loaded up on local produce, with great prices and supports local farmers. Will freeze some of it. Froze some other french breads from a local store for later. I always make more soups in the winter and love a chunk of hot fresh bread with it! I bought some seed-saving envelopes, to start saving my own seeds. I've been lazy about that! We save some of my left over veggie and herb seeds. I got a set of 100 (link on left sidebar) for $8.00 and have started with some flowers I had and a gorgeous purple, tall ornamental grass down the street-Bought new flatware, ours was really pretty beat up. I've been working quite a bit of overtime, with more coming, so I decided to replace it. I looked a lot online and did research. I got a great deal on Overstock.com for a 12 service setting set instead of an 8 service setting for the same price elsewhere. I also had a 15% off coupon, so it was about $110.00. Nice weight, should last the next 20 years, simple and pretty. I kept coming back to this pattern and loved it when I opened the box.  It's Mikasa French Countryside flatware-  Also came with a nice hostess/serving set , basically 2 large spoons, large fork and butter knife, great for the holidays coming up!  Hostess setI wanted to sort and reorganize the silverware drawer, when I bought the flatware, what a mess! Before-I bought a Erden Bamboo Expandable Drawer Organizer for Utensils, $25.00 on Amazon, fits perfect! I also moved some things to the china cabinet and donated some. Holds everything and the width is expandable. I measured carefully the inside edges of drawer. Fits great, with about 3\" extra in the back. Dave cut a piece of scrap wood in back so it's doesn't slide back. I put little-used items back there. Perfect, may buy another for my \"junk drawer. I liked the bamboo divider a lot! 5. Eat the Food- Try New Foods/Recipe- I made the new beef roast recipe in my last post which was great! A good use of some of the leftovers was to make a Philly Style French dip. I split two pieces of French bread, put thin slices of beef topped with Swiss cheese, sautéed bell peppers, a little pepperoncini then broiled. I made Au Jus to go with it and it was great on a work night. Sorry no photos! I found some new baking recipes I may try. This is on my list for the holidays, Rosie is an amazing baker!From Everythinglooksrosie.com Chelsea Bun6. Build Community Food Systems-We went to The Lakeview Fruit farmstead this weekend, they're closing soon. We bought some local apples (amazing), pears, huge bells peppers (.50 cents each!), local bread and 2 organic roasting chickens, will roast the chicken tonight- I bought enough apples to fill up our crisper in the fridge. Other than home-grown these are the best apples I've ever eaten! 7. Recycle/Re-Use-I made some donations to the local thrift store after cleaning more things out of the kitchen. Flatware and storage containers mostly. I found some really great deals on eBay for some used children's books for our grandson for Christmas. I know some people wouldn't do that, but if it's like new as an ex-Librarian, I know they will be fine. We're all thrifty in my family! I also scored a plush but I won't say which one in case one of my kiddos is reading this. 8. Skill Up-I learned all about stainless steel flatware when I started doing some research about buying a new set. It's mostly the weights of the steel which affects the durability, there's 18/10 (best) and 18/0 (less durable) as a rough guide. Then there's the styles, basically American (smaller) and European larger. I went with the larger, similar to the bistro type sizes I've used and liked. Interesting info here- NY Times Guides To Buying FlatwareI'm also learning about hot water heaters, more later!  9. Regenerate What is Lost/Salvage Something-Our TV signal died Friday. We had Roku so the internet worked, but lost all the other channels. We have an antenna on the roof, which has done a great job. We ditched cable quite a few years ago, talk about saving $$$! We have about 45+ free channels, the Roku channel (ton there)  and Netflix.  Dave checked the coax cable on the roof and it was toast. Luckily we had spare cable! For no cost Dave was able to re-install new cable, and fit it all back together. Only thing to do is paint it in the spring when it warms up.I got my new oil lamp burner from Lehman's, took about 3 weeks. Works great, looks nice and shiny! $5.00 fix-"},
{"title": "Tour Of My Home Office, Cross Rib Roast Beef", "date": "Nov 3, 2020", "text": "Tour Of My Home Office-We hit 17 degrees last week, now it's in the upper 60's! Down again in a few days with \"wintry mix\" and rain forecast. Much colder next week, so time to cozy up the house more! Anyway, when I first started working from home in late March I wasn't sure how long it would last. I started tweaking things over time after I realized this might be while. Now it's \"permanent\", but time will tell. Anyway this used to be a home office of sorts with a spare computer. Now it's a dedicated \"work space\", except for all my other stuff!  Here's what I've done, for little money! For the colder weather I recently I added a $10.00 Ikea fake sheepskin throw on my office chair, nice and toasty!  I used a giant safety pin on the top back so it stays put. We already had the chair-Nice view out the front window, I can adjust the blinds as needed- My messy area, avert your eyes! We had this desk before but wasn't big enough for two monitors. I asked Dave to take the keyboard tray and attach to the desk. He added a leg and it works great! South wall to my right when I'm sitting, radio/CD player, printer, kitty bed, heater and canning rack-I spent $10.00 and bought Anya a new kitty bed, she loves it! Keeps me company- I bought this radiant heater this summer knowing I'd need it. Trying to keep the house heating bill down. I turn it on in the morning and pre-heat the room a bit, then turn down the thermostat in the rest of the house. Anya lays next to it most of the morning- Top of my desk-Farm sign to my left, moved in from another room- wall color way off, it's a whiter sage green, weird lighting that morningCabinet behind me, I brought more white accents in from other rooms to lighten it up-I bought the faux barn door and then decided to add a clear command hook. Now I can add something seasonal, like my Happy Fall Y'all sign-Wall calendar on the right on the wall, nice floor lamp we already had there, nice even lighting! Top shelf on my left-Middle shelf-StuffBottom shelf- That's it, and I really like it! The only things I actually bought were the faux throw, farm Fall sign and heater. Cross Rib Roast Beef -This summer I got a nice beef roast for $8.00 and stashed it in the freezer. I thawed it and roasted it this weekend. It came out super juicy and very tender. Plenty for leftovers! It's about a 4 lb. roast and here's a recipe I used Cross Rib Roast w/ Garlic and Herbs Really simple, and I made it rare so we could re-heat some without over cooking-Coming out of the ovenI roasted multi colored small potatoes and onions with olive oil, salt, thyme and pepper. Wonderful!"},
{"title": "Record Cold Coming!", "date": "Oct 24, 2020", "text": "Record Cold Coming!We had almost 70 degree weather last weekend. The low tomorrow morning is supposed to be in the 20's and then in the teens on Monday! Winter is definitely rearing its head. These are record colds if they come thru.  The snow was flying on the infamous Cabbage Hill today in Oregon and the mountains here will get snow for sure. It was 51 degrees this morning when I got up at 7 am, then rained a bit off and on in the morning. It went from 51 down to 46 over about four or five hours and then the wind kicked in. Can't show the wind but the tress are whipping around!A big cold front from Alaska is hitting us. My husband Dave was talking to his brother this afternoon and he said they were having their coldest weather so far in the Portland, Oregon area. So we wrapped things up in the garden. When it hits 18° mowing is done! Davis did his last mow of the season. We moved most of the potted plants that we can winter over into the garage and composted the rest of the annuals. I decided to try and winter over my Rosemary in the garage this year so I'll see how it does. I've never had much luck wintering over inside the house, so I thought I'll try a cool, but warm area, and let it go slightly dormant. I went out in the coop today and added more pine shavings on their upper roosting area. We have the heated chicken waterer plugged in. I'm going to watch the temperature closely tonight and I'm a turn on the heat bulb since the three new hens have never had weather this cold.  Maybe tomorrow night as well. I'm ready for winter! This local weather guy below is always WAY ahead of the local weather TV folks. He's smart enough to not rely on just historical weather patterns! Gee maybe because the climate is changing. Anya is warm so she could care less! Covered my French lavender with 4 layers of row cover, worked great last year to winter over. I'll harvest my herbs in a few minutes that are left in my herb box mostly Thyme and Oregano-"},
{"title": "Making Traditional Chow Chow", "date": "Oct 18, 2020", "text": "Making Traditional Chow Chow-I always love learning new things! A few months ago I was watching a new series called Somewhere South hosted by the southern Chef Vivian Howard on PBS. One of the recipes it showed was Chow Chow, which I had never heard of, not being a Southerner. One of the segments was about how Chow Chow is made traditionally in Appalachia. In Appalachia in the fall, before the hard freezes came, everything would be gleaned from the garden. Things like green tomatoes, onions, cabbage, peppers, etc. The idea was basically take whatever you had on hand, chop it up, add spices in a tangy vinegary brine and make a relish. From what I have read traditionally Chow-Chow would be served with Pinto beans to brighten up the flavor. I had never actually heard that Pinto beans were a favorite in Appalachia. I tend to associate pinto beans more with Mexican food, but as we all know beans are a good source of protein, fiber and are cheap! There was a really interesting episode that showed the traditional Lumbee Tribe recipe of fried thin cornbread stuffed with collard greens and topped with a little Chow Chow-From PBS.orgVideo here of the couple on Somewhere South making the dish (if you can't see on your phone scroll to the bottom of the page and click on \"view web version\")-Really fascinating information! I decided to make some Chow Chow just to see what it was like. One of the main components is cabbage, so it's a very different flavor profile than something like Corn relish. Also a bit less on the carbs. The Ball Blue Book has a traditional recipe in it which is basically listed above. I did add some red pepper flakes, and a little bit of garlic powder for extra flavor. After I salted the vegetables I just gave the mix a toss a few hours later. It actually tasted pretty really great as is! On Somewhere South they had a person who created fermented Chow Chow. I decided to make the traditional brine though since I didn't want to risk losing a batch. I made some Kraut a while back, I was thrilled it was really good! About six weeks later it was mush and I had to throw it out. I have no idea what went wrong. Fermented things can just be touchy, a science and an art.Basic Ball recipe (minus the cauliflower) but you can certainly tweak Morningchores.com Chow Chow  I added a second red bell pepper and six sweet yellow Gypsy peppers. I used Apple cider vinegar but have seen recipes that used white vinegar. I omitted the cauliflower, since most other recipes I saw didn't use those. I doubled the brine, glad I did! I used a few more green tomatoes since they were small. I took the idea of using a food processer, what a time saver! You do need to pulse and not over-do it, or it could be mush. It was mazing how much juice came out of the green tomatoes right away-I did each vegetable separately to keep an eye on the size.  I did the cabbage last, in smaller batches, as some of it got stuck-After it sat overnight, salted, there was a lot of liquid-I used my giant spoon-then put it into a strainer and squashed out the liquid-Lots of juice!Next I rinsed in cold water and stirred well-strained again-I used just about all of the brine, which I DOUBLED luckily! Simmered 10 minutes, cooked the chow 10 minutes. I put in jars for the fridge. Not enough to really can. We'll use it up and give some to my kids. So far I love the flavor, very tangy!!!UPDATE- After letting sit overnight and chilling, it was really crunchy, I loved the texture! I might go a little lighter on the sugar next time, but that's me. Nice otherwise!!!"},

We had over 1/2\" rain in 12 hours last Saturday. Much cooler temperatures this week. Frost forecast tomorrow night and 37 degrees predicted. No more 80 degree weather! Dave and I went out Thursday night into the veggie garden. He picked all the squash and peppers, I picked the tomatoes. I found that with heavy rain sometimes tomatoes and things will actually crack and didn't want to lose anything. The green tomatoes I'll either leave on the counter to ripen or will go in a batch of Chow Chow, the rest will be used for various projects-The giant Italian peppers are so huge that they never had enough time to turn red, but they'll be delish anyway! Those are really great to either freeze and use for pasta sauce later or stuffed and roasted like these Stuffed Italian Frying Peppers-BIG!The sweet Gypsy Peppers, basically like pepperoncini peppers, will probably be used for Chow Chow and/or frozen with some tomatoes-Will pick mini pumpkins tonight-I harvested my last little Lavender re-bloom-Dave said it's always depressing to tear up the summer garden, and yes it is, but less weekend work coming up. No more watering/weeding and mowing will wind down. The chickens had a great time realizing that there is a lot more open space and started chowing down on some of the squash leaves. The Case Of the Flying Chicken-There's Sunny, one of our younger hens, who apparently can fly even with major flight feather trimming! I kept finding her on top of the garden fence and/or in the main part of the garden. Safety-wise we have several dogs on the other side of our neighbor's 6' fence. I decided to ask Dave to help me add an upper level of spare chicken wire. I think once she gets bigger we can take it down- So far it's worked! What a trouble maker! Autumn/ Halloween Decor- Autumn decor is up, and comforter on the bed! I had a cough/cold for almost 2 weeks and would have gotten it all done earlier otherwise. Luckily real rain feel this weekend! Dave and I put up some corn stalks on the front of the house to start. He got them free from a local community garden. When they harvest the corn they give away the stalks, win win! He also put up all our fun Halloween stuff outside-Not sure if trick or treating will happen in Covid times. We may host a party here for our Grandchildren and their parents. I did the inside and much of it thrifted (of course!) -I added a few things to my home office as well!Herb Crusted Pork Loin Roast Recipe- When we went grocery shopping I found pork loin roasts on a buy one get one free! Basically $2.00 per pound, score. I bought two and froze one. I used one for this nice recipe I wanted to try Herb Crusted Pork Loin Roast  I didn't have grainy Dijon Mustard so I used 1/2 Dijon and 1/2 Spicy Deli mustard. I thought straight Dijon might be a bit too strong. I also omitted the salt as mustard is very salty as it is. I think some people over-salt, and if you do, bummer. If not, you can add some on your own portion. My roast was thicker and took almost an hour longer, so adjust time as needed. I baked some Acorn squash with a little butter and brown sugar to go with it. Perfect Autumn meal! Pork was juicy and excellent flavor. Just make the rub, spread it on, pop it in the oven, set the timer, walk away! Easy peasy."},
{"title": "Day Trip, Drying Squash, Review Vidalia Dicer/Chopper", "date": "Oct 1, 2020", "text": "Day Trip-With the smoke coming and going from the California fires we finally had a break last week. A bit of a rain storm blew in last Thursday/ Friday which clear the skies. Saturday morning I woke up and the skies were deep, deep blue. We have been wanting to drive up to McCall for the day, just to get out of town to get a change of scenery. Saturday morning I decided to check the air quality in McCall since it had been pretty bad up there as well. Separate from the California fires there was a fire west of McCall and the smoke is drifting from there too.  Turned out the air quality was great! I asked Dave if he wanted to take off for the day and go to McCall and it was a resounding yes! The forecast was a little bit of intermittent rain coming and going, so we dressed for cooler weather with some possible rain. There were a few storm clouds here and there driving up-Skies clearingOutside McCallAfter we got into town we stopped at our normal McCall Brewery for lunch. From there we went to Stacy's cakes and got some desserts to take home since they closed in the afternoon. We did our normal Loop driving all the way around the lake and then hit a fun thrift store, Toby's. I spotted a heavy steel Fleur-de-lis hose reel, of all things. I decided to buy it, $8.00, and do something else with it-FrontTopBaseI asked Dave if he can have a pal at work use a grinder and remove the two Fleur-de-lis pieces.  That's the plan, then I will re-purpose. More on that project later! Lake side, water's low Wildflowers in a park-We drove down the highway on the backside of McCall for a change of scenery. We never did hit much rain at all. I hit a dollar store that's a different chain from Boise's and I found a little lantern for Autumn for $5.00, has an LED candle-All in all was a great trip, gorgeous scenery and fun! Drying Squash-We had a good harvest of our yellow squash this year. I decided to dry some to use for soups over the winter. I have a nice little Nesco food dehydrator, so I got it out and cleaned it. You could use a baking sheet for this as well. I sliced all the squash up about a quarter of an inch thick then I had quartered it-After I got all the squash laid out, and stacked I turned it on, I left it for about three or four hours. Next  I rotated the trays. Ran another 2 to 3 hours and it was all done! I basically had two large squashes condensed down to 1 quart canning jar. Reminds me of a jar of sunshine!Review Vidalia Dicer/Chopper- I had seen this Vidalia brand dicer/chopper on someone else's blog and thought I wanted to try one. When I made corn relish a while back it took me forever to dice up all bell peppers and onions. I figured it might be a real time-saver and it turns out it is! I was really impressed by the fact is a very, very heavy composite material. It is not cheap flimsy plastic-Nice sharp stainless steel bladesComes with two blades and cleaning tool-Measurements on the side- Heavy box- I was making some black bean soup for the cooler weather. I decided to use it to test drive by dicing up some bell peppers, tomatoes and onion. Separate from being much faster you also get very uniform size pieces, which is great for cooking. I started off with a bell pepper, a little older, the skin was a little shriveled. Basically I cut it in quarters, took out the seeds and white pithy part-Just lay down the pepper, close the top down, done!Worked great for the onions and tomatoes too! Washed well but a few bits here and thereCleaning tool comes with it, really helped! Use the tool, rinse well, grid came out clean-I give it two thumbs up, great for all kinds of fruits and veggies, etc. I used the chopper blade, the dicer is even smaller, will be great for fine work. With soup season coming, and making more homemade salsas, I'm happy! Amazon link on left sidebar for more info!"},

I asked Dave to decide if I should do a \"spiced\" pear, he declined. Works for me! This is a good reminder, if you're going to plant some trees, plant fruit trees! And a few different varieties. You can keep, barter or sell if needed. Our apple harvest this weekend was about 20 apples, sad. I do have some frozen from last year, so I may make some apple butter in the next month.Autumn Garden Clean Up-It's that time of year! Starting to remove things that aren't producing from the garden. The Lemon cukes were first. I harvested them, then Dave removed the chicken mini-fence. The girls feasted on the leaves! Next Dave harvested all the ripe tomatoes, about 1 gallon +, some peppers, then he trimmed them all way back. The trimmings went to the compost bin-They look naked! Still lots left to ripen, will watch the weather closely-Collards still going great! Flowers have rebounded since it's cooled off -Losing Power-We lost power here for about an hour Friday morning. I had just started working and heard a loud BAM, then lights out. It was so smoky that at 8:30 am it was dark. Luckily a storm blew in the night and really cleared the air!!! I turned on a LED battery lantern and called the power company. It was on in about an hour. I had already planned to fill and clean my oil lamps. With September being preparedness month I kind of laughed a bit. So this weekend I got them all out, washed and filled, they had been dusty and low on oil-I also put new batteries in a few small flashlights. They are also ready! We bought new wiper blades for the cars, they were really bad. My car battery died too, luckily it was under warranty and got a new one for $40.00! Glad it died in nice weather in the garage. Dave and I jumped it, and off he went coming home with a new one! Blue Skies/ Birds Are Back-Saturday I realized I was hearing the birds sing. I realized that with the heavy smoke they weren't around-Smoky skies!Sunday the sky was an even deeper blue and the birds were singing like crazy! I posted a video/audio on my Instagram, link on upper right. Listen to them! It's amazing. I sat outside for quite a while just listening to them, made me so happy. Blogger Legacy Gone/Problems-From what I can see Blogger \"legacy\" is gone, can't find it now. It's free so I can't complain too much. I'm sure Google had to update it for all the phones/browsers out there. I have had 0 luck with multiple help tickets on not being able to add HTML code. Shocker. I kept getting \"do this and this\", when they obviously didn't bother reading my notes that I already had followed the instructions. Duh. I wonder if Google doesn't want people to be able to add codes, like Amazon links, to earn money? What can expect? I also don't like the \"labels\" feature, the previous drop down menu was easier to see. Anyone else having problems???"},
{"title": "Independence Days Challenge", "date": "Sep 11, 2020", "text": "Independence Days Challenge-It's been cooling off a little bit here, but a few hot days once in a while. Generally the days are getting so much shorter that it's cooling off at night really nicely. Trees locally are getting some color, as is our huge maple tree-We're getting a little bit of smoke again from California, not much we can do about that. There's also terrible fires now over in the Oregon areas we love. One is nearing an urban area where Dave's nephew lives, he may have to evacuate. I can't believe there are stupid people doing stupid things, like gender reveals involving explosives! Yeah that's a great idea to do in a drought stricken area! My one daughter was smart enough to do a pie reveal. One was supposed to be pink or blue, easy and safe! So anyway, here's what we've been up to lately-1. Plant Something- Not this time of year, too hot/cold. I don't do fall plantings here. Might do some flower bulbs for spring.2. Harvest Something- We just had a really nice harvest of tomatoes! They were late but prolific!!!Many of these are heading for the freezer. We've also been getting Basil, several kinds of peppers, Kale, Collard greens, lemon cukes (almost done), the last of the blackberries and yellow squash. I'll be the drying some yellow squash for this winter. My BIG Italian peppers haven't turned red yet, but should soon. They're worth the wait! Collard greensGreen cabbage coming along slowly, red cabbage never got heads for some reason-We have our mini-pumpkin patch too, I planted a mixed-seed varieties-3. Preserve/Store Something-I finished up the jams, chutneys, from the peaches that we had-We let the pears ripen inside since they were pretty green over Labor Day weekend, which is when I had hoped to can them. I'll be canning these this weekend-Will be harvesting our apples next weekend. Didn't have a great crop this year, but I'll decide what to do with those.  I still have plenty of apples in the freezer and canned previously. I may dry some. I have a small, nice food dryer. It's been challenging finding canning supplies and I guess that seem to be a national issue since it's been on the news Washingtonpost Canning Shortage  I was able to find some pint size jars on Amazon, so I did order one box today. Wasn't much more than I would usually pay in the grocery store, although haven't bought jars in a few years. I have tons of Basil and will make pesto to freeze soon. 4. Manage Reserves- Get a Good Deal/Barter/Stock Up/Prep-I went out to the Eddie Bauer Outlet on a whim. It's on the outskirts of Boise and found some great deals. I found women's flannel lined jeans, polar fleece lined wind pants (water resistant) and a regular pair of jeans. The warm ones will be handy in winter! They were all $17 each, a real steal,  very expensive (overpriced) originally-Nice pockets!So soft and warm Cheery flannel!I got a new HEPA air filter replacement as my previous one died.  It turns out Amazon does not honor the warranties after a certain point, so I contacted the manufacturer directly. Took about 3 weeks, then I got a new one in the mail a few days ago. The other ones have lasted for years and years so I was really shocked it died after 4 months!I ordered some pasta bowls from Ikea online that were delivered. Even with the shipping I can't find good ones for their prices. My old ones were in bad shape, but they lasted lots of years! When I ordered canning jars on Amazon I also bought a Vidalia Chopper/ Dicer-I like making things like corn relish, but it is so much dicing for big batches! I've decided to make another big batch, for the fridge. I'm running out of canning jars and it should last quite a few months chilled in my 2 Qt. jars.  5. Eat the Food- Try New Foods/Recipe-Will be using some of my homemade Chutney that I now that I have some. I posted recently about the BLT sandwich with catfish although I did substitute tilapia for that. Was great with our fresh tomatoes! Also tried the new Mexican dish that I posted about last week-Cooked down the last of the frozen Rhubarb and made sauce for Dave.6. Build Community Food Systems-We supported our local Orchard and farmstead stand by buying our peaches, corn, apples and a few other things. We may go back next weekend to see if we can get some more apples and corn. The local Gala apples were the best I've ever had in my entire life. To say they were crispy was putting it mildly, really juicy and amazing-7. Recycle/Re-Use-I did some mending of some clothes, donated some bedding, towels, toys & decor to our local thrift store. I realized I had stashed some new bath towels from last time we went to Ikea, last year. The ones we were using we're getting pretty beat up, so it's nice to be able to get into the hall closet and bring out new ones! Sadly Ikea discontinued their apple green bath towels which I love, sigh. 8. Skill Up-I checked out Jamie Oliver's cookbook Ultimate Veg since I've been seeing some of the episodes on PBS. I love his recipes! I'm happy we can still get things from the Library, just can't go in. He has a really great use of spices and different cooking techniques I'm getting familiar with. Will be posting some reviews later as I try some of them-9. Regenerate What is Lost/Salvage Something-Last year we added some new fence boards in our backyard after a small dog got in and killed two of our hens.  Dave didn't like the way the new boards stood out from the old.  He borrowed one of  relatives electric pressure washer. We are both pretty shocked about how fast a lot of dirt just came right off the boards. Electric pressure washers don't have the same high pressure as the gas powered ones do, but it did a great job! Clean part of the board on the right- Before photo last fall-River saying high to neighbor kitty PoseyAfter shot- After shot, was really dark before! Not perfect but it will weather out anyway. After working in my home office/bedroom I realized how dirty our blinds were. When we bought the house the 2 front bedrooms had heavy, wood grain, plastic white blinds. Great for light control, so we added curtains and kept them-I realized how dirty they were, so I asked Dave to take them down and I could wash them. Turns out they were too long for the tub! So Dave took them out washed them down and rinsed well, let dry. So white now!!!DryingSo much cleaner! That's it for now!"},
{"title": "50 Degree Drop, Making Peach Chutney & Low Sugar Jams, Rick Bayless Mexican Chilaquiles", "date": "Sep 9, 2020", "text": "50 Degree Drop-We had some record-setting heat last week, about 103! Luckily things moderated. Monday night we had a cold front blowing in from Canada and the temperature dropped. We had really high gusting winds, some power outages, and downed trees. Part of the highway was closed due to severe blowing dust. Luckily we didn't have any damage here. We woke up and it was 45 degrees Tuesday morning! The winds also pushed some small fires into larger grass fires and forest fires. I was listening to a climatologist interview this morning and he said we just had real extremes. He are having severe heat and fires in the West, and in the Mountain West severe cold and snow. Terrible fires now in Oregon too, very sad. Glad I bought the heater for my home office, never thought I'd use it this early. It's warming into the 80's this week, but fall is in the air...Making Peach Chutney & Low Sugar Jams-I thought I'd mention this since in this post- there's a canning supplies shortage in Boise. It's the first time I've ever seen this. I can't find canning jars anywhere, as well as lids and rings. Luckily I had about lots of extra lids last year that I didn't use. Now I'm down to my last 13 Quart jars! I used just about everything else up. Hopefully that will be enough for my pears to can this weekend, if not I will do something else with the excess. It's funny, in March, after Covid hit, I thought I should probably buy some extra jars, and I didn't. Now I'm kicking myself, live and learn! Anyway here's some of what I did on my long Labor Day weekend!....I decided to use some of my peaches to make some peach chutney. After trying Jamie Oliver's flatbread with chutney, yogurt and eggs why buy some over-priced/processed chutney? I had seen several \"authentic versions\". I used the basic Ball Peach Chutney recipe as a base since I'd be canning it. In addition to what they had listed I also added 1 Tsp Turmeric, 1/2 Tsp Cardamom, 50% more Mustard seeds and 2 cloves diced fresh garlic. Ball had the garlic as \"optional\". I cut the recipe in 1/2 since I didn't want quite that much!  This does take a while to cook down and thicken, as I found out! Over two hours! No pectin is used and it thickens on cooling. Good description here as well as another recipe BBC.Co.UK How To Make ChutneyCooking awayAll done!Next I did two batched of peach jams. The Pomona Pectin worked great! Sets up FAST. I did all the peaches in one day. Size-wise, to clarify of you're new to canning, a 1/2 pint is a standard \"Jelly Jar\". See the smaller ones above. At the end of the day I canned, all low sugar-Peach Jam, 11 X 1/2 pints and four X Pints. I tossed in about 1 cup of our fresh Blackberries and mashed them in. Nice color/flavor bonus, and it looks like jars of sunshine!Spiced Peach jam, four X 1/2 Pints and three X Pints. I add cinnamon, cloves and a pinch of Allspice. Tastes like peach pie filling!Peach Chutney, I canned six X half Pints and two Pints. You can use jam, along with onions and ginger on top of pork chops beside the traditional use.  Just heat thru and put on top!Next Corn Relish-For the corn relish I used this basic recipe, Summery Corn Relish  but with White vinegar and white onions. I also added 8 cloves of garlic, smashed. I started with a giant can of corn, a little less than one Gallon ($3.00), and adjusted the recipe accordingly. Total was 6 Qts. I may make more next month. I saw this on someone's blog, wished I had one! Relish is lots of dicing!!! I may buy one-Next Rhubarb sauce!  I thawed out some rhubarb from last year and made about two Quarts of rhubarb sauce. Dave loves the stuff! Basically I thawed the rhubarb, drained off most of the juice, cooked that down, added sugar to taste. It wasn't enough to bother with canning (and I'm getting low on jars) so it will be in the refrigerator. Should keep for months. My pantry rack looked like this before canning, last 3 jars of last year's jam, with last year's peaches and apples-After canning, here we go! Added jams and chutney-Corn relish added-I have room below for the pears, then I'll be done! I'l be freezing some tomatoes and peppers. Will dehydrate some squash for soups. And maybe a few other things. I'm thinking about plums?Rick Bayless's Mexican Chilaquiles-After seeing this the other night I decided to try it! Rick Bayless, famous American chef, called it Mexican comfort food. I followed the recipe, roasting a chicken with Mexican seasonings, and using a store-bought Tomatillo salsa. Basically you heat up salsa, add chicken broth and onions, simmer, toss in tortilla chips, toss, toss, add shredded chicken, toss, toss, cover for 2-3 minutes. That's it! Top with sliced onions, Cilantro Mexican cheeses. Recipe video (with link for printed version)  Ming.com Rick Bayless  It was spicy and unique. You could also probably use other meats. I think it's a keeper. I cut the recipe in half and it was still a LOT! He also advises soaking white onion slices to \"de-flame\" them, as done in Mexico. Get rids of some of the heat, but keeps the nice crunch! I'd never heard of that! You learn something new every day..."},

I did a double-take because they walked right by our pear tree and those look like our pears-It took me a minute or two to register that they probably took them. There is an easement between our lot and the duplexes next to us. They look like they were out for a walk, walking slow and just decided to take some. I was so shocked it took a few minutes for me to register what probably happened. I went out a few minutes later and they were gone. I don't know that I would have asked them or confronted them since I don't really know them. I went out on my lunch break and picked as many pears as I could reach and brought them inside. I mentioned this to Dave when he got home and he said \"oh that's odd, the next door neighbor yesterday said \"you guys have a lot of nice pears\". \" Dave harvested the rest of the pears last night and brought them in-I kept thinking about how to deal with this without getting into a hostile engagement with a neighbor. Finally late in the evening I came up with the idea to put the sign out on the fence facing their property. I basically put it on the other side of the pear tree where they would see it walking by. I was surprised by all this, even though I have read on some Permaculture Facebook groups, about people having their produce stolen out of their yards. There is a chance that they simply picked up some pears that were on the ground in the easement. The karma for them is they were still pretty green, so probably not that great tasting. These pears are ripe when they turn yellow/blush. I was going to process them this weekend anyway and they're ripening inside a little bit faster. What can you do and the sad thing they had two young children with them so how is that modeling integrity, making the right choice when no one is looking? If they would have asked I'd have given them some... I'll be canning these for the winter, should be great!September Is Preparedness Month/ Covid Style-Yes it's that time of year! National Preparedness Month. With all of the weather disasters, fires, snow, hurricanes, electrical outages now there's also Covid. Another reason to think about being prepared. When Covid first hit I brought in my emergency medical kit. I had bought a cheap plastic tool box and filled it with of different kinds of bandages, OTC meds, including surgical masks. Those masks were really cheap when I bought them, not so much now. I've always told myself as a reminder-  we're one highway away from empty grocery stores. In other words there's only one main highway in or out of Boise. If there is a major snow problem, summer fires, etc it would be pretty scary with stores emptying. Good time to remind yourself to have extra foods that don't require any preparation (bonus) as well as lots of water on hand. I bought some extra batteries recently and realized that most of my oil lamps were pretty low. I brought my bottles of oil in and will refill. I'd rather have those kinds of things done and not need them than the opposite. And it's so easy to do a little at a time! There's tons of resources online so feel free to check all that out or you can search this blog for my previous posts under the topic preparedness. You can store all kinds of things easliy, in closets, under your beds, garages. Lots of info here Ready.gov  And don't forget your pets! Harvest/ Food Preservation Time!We've been having a really great harvest the last week or so of tomatoes, lemon cucumbers and several peppers-We bought some peaches from a local orchard and I processed all of those this last weekend. I froze a small amount to keep through the winter. The rest I froze until this coming Labor Day weekend. I have 5 days off!!! They will be thawed and I will be making jams and chutneys. It was pretty tough in Boise to find any low sugar pectin, anywhere! I finally decided to try the local natural grocery store and found lots of Pomona's pectin, talk about happy! I bought five boxes and that should be plenty-This weekend I also cleaned out our freezer and found some of last Summer's peaches buried. I thawed those and made a really big peach and blueberry cobbler, wow was it good! Here it is going in-Yummy!I like to use this recipe for the topping- Topping For CrispMy fermented pickles are coming along great after one week. I decided they weren't quite sour enough, so I'm giving them another week. They'll store for months in the fridge. I'm using my Vegetable Master fermenting jar with an airlock for one recipe and 2 Masontops for another recipe. Making lots of salsa with are dead ripe tomatoes, peppers from the garden and lots of fresh cilantro and purple onion. I just a little bit of red wine vinegar and salt and it's good to go. I make this tonight to use up some tomatoes, it's Fried Catfish BLTS, it's delish!!! I used Tilapia since I couldn't find any catfish.  For other foods-I have a couple gallon bags of Rhubarb in the freezer, will make Rhubarb sauce and a new recipe I saw recently Newfoundland Rhubarb Relish. I found another one that's a bit different. I think I'll make a couple of small batches and I will report back! I have a gallon of corn to make Corn Relish, will can this time. Will be canning pears too. I may thaw some frozen apples, since we're about out of Apple Butter. Homemade is so GOOD!!! With 5 days off I will be focusing on food storage/processing as you can see!Extra Office Heat Solution-With Autumn-like weather starting in a bit (50 this morning) winter is around the corner. Last month I decided to buy a heater for my home office. Instead of running the furnace all day while I'm working I thought about buying this heater, closing the door and saving some $$$- We had similar ones before and they worked great! Very safe. I got it from Ace, since I like to support local stores! It's on wheels, is oil-filled for radiant heat, 3 settings and a thermostat. Warms up gradually and Anya loves it! Should easily pay for itself, only $65.00."},

Thrifted Galileo Barometer, Chick Update", "date": "Aug 22, 2020", "text": "Smoky Skies-I've seen the fires in California on the national news and it's just absolutely horrendous. I really feel for all the loss of lives, both human and animal, loss of housing, businesses, wilderness, etc. The smoke has been so bad it's been drifting from California into Nevada and Idaho the last several days. It makes for gorgeous sunrises and sunsets, but is pretty bad otherwise. Early morning yesterday I saw a bright orange red ball in the sky. I wish I could have got a better picture-It's really exacerbated people who have underlying respiratory issues, like me, with asthma and allergies. But it could be worse at least Idaho isn't on fire the way California is! I hope they get some rain soon.Rural Farmer's Market Haul-A few years ago we got some amazing peaches from one of Dave's co-workers. They were from a local farm/orchard and I started thinking about that the other day. They're about a 40-minute drive from here so I called ahead and they had those peaches! They're different because they're a smaller farm so they can really tree-ripen their fruits. We may go back soon for some plums. We drove out today and I bought two crates of peaches. Sorry I don't remember the variety but they're like an Elberta Peach, but much bigger, the size of a SOFTBALL!Chilling in the bedroomBeauties!The peaches I'm going to freeze soon, then over Labor Day weekend (five days off with PTO) I'm going to make some big batches of peach jam. I may also can some peaches. Our poor Peach tree kind of fizzled out this year, so I was happy to buy some local peaches. Sadly none of the fruit I bought today was organic, but what can you do. Hopefully next year will be better. Our pears are ripening so I may have enough to can as well!!!At the second farm stand we hit on the way back we got several pounds of amazingly fresh pickling cucumbers. Whenever I found them at a grocery store they tend to be mushy and bruised. This time I found some great fresh ones and I'll use these for some fermented pickles. They were muddy when I got them home, so they got a bath and a chill! Also got some Gaston's bread, local and amazing! Freezes great and got an apple Danish too, yummy!We also got several pounds of fresh Gala apples, super crunchy. I've noticed this last year in the winter fall and spring that almost all the apples I had bought in grocery stores were mushy. I tried different stores, I tried different varieties and just didn't have much luck. So when I bought these I bought enough to fill up our crisper probably about five or six pounds. Will keep these for eating apples-I bought a bag of a dozen ears of sweet corn and some Blackberry pancake syrup. All in all it was a great haul!Easy/ Cheap Old Monitor To Laptop Fix!I thought I'd share this in case some of you may be using older computers and need to retro-fit them. My computer I've been using in the kitchen (mostly for blogging) was an older Windows 7. I had a nice size older monitor on it. *** Updated Info*** Here's the basics on the technology redo- there's basically two kinds of monitors, old analog ones with a giant blue plug and pins with screws-That was what I had. The newer monitors are digital and do not need an adapter. Because my monitor was older and analog there was no way to run it to the laptop without using an adapter. I hope that makes sense? Please post more questions if you need. We bought a Windows 10 laptop this last spring, it was a great deal. We wanted something more secure for banking, etc. I finally decided that I had enough of Windows 7 since it was getting SO SLOW. We thought about what our options were, maybe buying a new digital monitor that would work with the laptop?  We finally realized for $8 we could buy an adapter to use with the analog monitor. A cheap and easy fix!Basically I backed everything up on our external hard drive first from the old Windows 7 hard drive-Old hard drive, We're keeping it for now just to make sure I didn't miss anything. External hard drive-Next I went ahead and backed up the external hard drive to the laptop. You could use a thumb drive if you don't have many files or email them to yourself. Then we plugged in the old monitor into the laptop using a HDMI to VGA adapter seen below. The blue analog monitor plug goes into the adapter, and then it plugs into the side of the laptop-Basically this creates the laptop as your hard drive. You can go into the display/ power settings and set up the laptop so that it \"does nothing when you close the screen\". This set up gives you lots of flexibility, since we can still use the laptop in other parts of the house. When I work out in the kitchen I can just plug my monitor into the side of the laptop, it's ready to go. Here's the HDMI to VGA adapter-Plugged in- Close the laptop, less distracting for me-Good tech fix for $8.00!Thrifted Galileo Barometer-We stopped at a thrift store the other night and out of the corner of my eye I spotted a Galileo barometer! For five bucks I squealed with delight and practically ran out of there with it. I had one years ago but it got broken and I never replaced it. As soon as I got at home I cleaned all the glass and put it in a safe place and it works! He was invented by Galileo in the 1600 and basically has little balls that are all calibrated to rise or sink depending on me ear temperature. This afternoon said 72° which was about spot-on! Each glass ball has a temperature on it on a metal tag-More info here Galileo ThermometerChick Update-I'm happy to report all of our \"chicks\" are doing well and are almost half-size. They're all very healthy and the flock seems to have settled in pretty well with each other. I don't see a whole lot of squabbles anymore. We did have to trim their flight feathers today again because they were flying up on top of our 4-foot fence. If they got over the 4-foot fence into the yard wouldn't really be a huge problem. The problem would be if they got from the 4-foot fence to the 6-foot fence and went over into our neighbor's backyard. They have about four dogs that would kill them. So Dave and I trimmed them again. Later in the day I got some nice photos. I really like having a mixed flock so you can tell all the birds apart. Our older hen Rosie is now molting. Neither of my two older birds have been laying anything for about the last four to six weeks. The good news is with the three younger hens will hopefully start laying around October or November. So here's a look at the girls! You can really see all there individual markings pretty well on these photos. It is hard to get pictures of chickens since they won't stand still!Luna, the Silver Laced Wyandotte-Debbie, a Golden Sexlink- Sunny, a Brown Leghorn-"},

It dropped 20+ degrees in three hours. We just water, water. It 's been a tough year for our tomatoes, they're about a month behind. I had the idea last week to cut back the excess foliage to help them ripen faster. We usually do this in Sept/Oct! There's tons of tomatoes, just mostly green. The good news is it's still August so they should ripen soon! These are the \"after\" shots, visualize green leaves exploding out of the cages!!! AnyaGoing Back To A DSLR Camera-I started using an SLR (Single Lense Reflex) camera when I was young. The last 10 + years I switched to a point and shoot and it works great for a lot of things. Many people use their phone cameras, but I prefer the real thing. There's so much more you can get right, without having to alter the photos later. Dave gave me his 10 + year old D (Digital) SLR recently and I'm getting reacquainted with it. The photos are much more crisp, work SO much better in mixed, natural lighting. Here's a few samples, some with a macro lense- Lovely Anya, faster shutter speed helps hereThe shot above is a great example, clear with a blurred background! Natural lightingGrandson River, great in low lightingAnother example, crisp, great detail, low lightingI'm still using my point and shoot, but will be migrating away from it. You'll be seeing better photos!Blackberry Crumb Cake-Our blackberries really loved our wet May/June! Picking lots, freezing some and did some baking this weekend-More comingSince we had so many berries I made my favorite Sandi's Blackberry Crumb Cake  FYI, I don't use a food processor, a pastry cutter works fine. Less clean up time! I subbed WW Pastry flour and walnuts instead of pecans. It's moist and slightly crunchy from the topping! You could use raspberries too, the tartness makes the cake-A Greek DinnerI stumbled on some recipes lately and thought I'd try these! Nice for summer time, just wish I'd had fresh tomatoes from the garden. Video here - Diane Kochilas Greek Odyssey Video PBS Eggplant recipe- Garlicky Eggplant  Polenta recipe- Ionian Polenta  The sauce was a bit chunkier than hers but still delish! I made an 11\" x 13\" pan, leftovers were even better! Next time I think I'd roast the eggplant slices to cut down on the olive oil. Just brush with oil til slightly soft. I also reduced the oil in the polenta. I served with Feta cheese, nice, fresh tasting summer meal! It's a keeper!"},
{"title": "Independence Days Challenge", "date": "Aug 9, 2020", "text": "Independence Days ChallengeHere's what we've been up to! It's been water, water water, at least we're out of the triple digits!1. Plant Something- Nope, past that time. 2. Harvest Something- Yellow Gypsy/bell peppers, Lemon cukes, tomatoes, yellow squash, pickling cukes (just eating, not enough to ferment), slicing cukes, Blackberries, no pears yet, small amount of apples soon-  You can see why they call them \"Lemon\" cucumbers!3. Preserve/Store Something- Will be drying some yellow squash. Have been buying low priced chicken parts and freezing. 4. Manage Reserves- Get a GoodDeal/Barter/Stock Up/Prep- Bought some Elderberry syrup to stash for the upcoming flu/Covid season. Buying sale price chicken, sausages. I realized I didn't have a summer twin quilt for our bed. After Grandson River spent the night I got a great deal, $20.00 at Walmart, light teal, basket weave design, but what's that lump? Anya burrowed down, taking a nap!5. Eat the Food- Try NewFoods/Recipe- Tonight I made a BBQ Chicken Salad, see recipe below. I bought Orange Poppyseed dressing, used breasts with ribs (more flavor) and used regular bacon. Yummy, sorry no photo! This is from a recipe I saw online and modified- Part 1-Part 2-6. Build Community Food Systems- Contacted a local peach farm to find out about buying some ripe peaches. I'm looking for some to eat, freeze and make some jams. 7. Recycle/Re-Use- I deep cleaned/recycled/donated old DVDs, CD cases, and freed up quite a few really nice baskets! My daughter is taking them home to use-The space freed up in our one entertainment cabinet now has room for our emergency lighting- candles, batteries, oil lamps-I found this at a thrift store, love it!Love the basket of eggs on the cork screw tail-8. Skill Up- Found an easy/cheap way to solve a tech issue, more later ! 9. Regenerate What is Lost/Salvage Something- Last year Dave got an old free metal bookcase from work going to the dumpster, we adopted, a good size for the grand kids toy, etc. in our spare bedroom-It's probably about 40 years old. I decided once the weather warmed up to paint it. Dave had bought some wholesale industrial spray paint (Ford blue) and we had it in our stash. I thought it would work well with our decor. Dave took it outside to paint and set up saw horses for me. I washed it down with Dawn and hot water first, rinsed well-  Two shelvesBookcase I started spraying!About four cans of spray paint later-I love it!!! I bought 2 bins at Lakeshore Learning for $8.00 each, great storage-Dave built some bird houses in the winter, I finally finished this one. He started with used cedar fence boards we had-  I tried spray paint, not enough coverage-I bought a small can of white house paint in a sample isze- Much better coverage-I used our blue house trim paint we already had for the accents- Ready for some birds!Re-painted part of my winter snowman sign-pretty beat up from the weather, was thriftedSince I can't draw I decided to touch it up, as much as possible-I went around the buttons I realized after closer inspection there had been red cheeks and a mouth, re-painted that as well as I could. Come November I'll buy some red and green Christmas holly fabric to replace the strips that were on the arms. Otherwise all done and ready for winter!"},
{"title": "Updating Home Office/ Adding Desk Extension", "date": "Aug 4, 2020", "text": "Updating Home Office/ Adding Desk Extension-When I started working from home in late March I didn't know how long it was going to be. We had a nice little desk in our spare bedroom that Dave mostly used. I decided to start using it. It faces the front yard, facing East and has a nice view out the window-Previously in my office at work I had two monitors, which I really needed. Since they were moving out a huge amount of staff at once I only got one monitor, which was frustrating but I got used to it. This week they gave some of us second monitors, and some extra equipment since it looks like we'll be working from home permanently. Permanently is a loose term since who knows how long that means? Anyway I picked up my second monitor and this weekend Dave built me an extension for my current desk to have room for it-2nd monitor waitingEnd of deskLuckily I saw the keyboard tray that I had Dave remove from the desk on the floor. I had a eureka moment thinking that we could basically use the keyboard extension as an extension on the desk to hold the other monitor. Dave used some heavy brackets and added a pine leg for stability-works great!!!I also wanted to update some of the decor as the walls are a light sage green, but is a cooler color. Some of the art on the walls were dark blacks and grays, which seemed too dark. So I swapped out some prints that I already had with white or light backgrounds. Then I bought a few things at Big Lots. I got a really cute little faux wreath, a white faux mini farm door and little wooden sign that says Live Simply with a white background. The sign was $5 and the wreath was $6, door was $20-I transformed my previous home office into my full-time work office with a little bit more pizzazz. I also decided to reorganize our canning and storage rack so it looked a little bit nicer. Those little things to tweak. When you're working in a home office 8 hours a day and 5 days a week you notice all the little annoying things,  messy rack-Before, messy desk shelves- After shelf shot- Also cleared off  small organizer with drawers-I also re-purposed my thrifted frame/ home printed sign I had in my old office-Now in my main hall with my lemon topiary I made!"},
{"title": "Homesteading Challenges/ Losing A Crop/Variety, Spicy Fried Chicken and Buttermilk Biscuits", "date": "Jul 29, 2020", "text": "Homesteading Challenges/ Losing A Crop/Variety-Last years I canned 24 Qt's of peaches, baked some, froze some, gave some to the kids-This year, less than 10 peaches, see photo on top. I think one of the biggest problem was the unstable weather, since we had a night where it was 24 degrees. All the blossoms were on the tree sadly. Really bad combination. This another good reason why it's really good to have some variety in your garden including fruit trees. We also have an apple tree and a pear tree tons of pears and some apples-There have been years where we've had very little to no apples or just a small amount of pears. Last year tons of peaches! So, if you're thinking about planting fruit trees I highly encourage you to plant a variety of different kinds of fruit, so that you have something. This year we have a massive amount pears, which is awesome, so I will be canning some. We have a moderate to low amount of apples.Spicy Fried Chicken and Buttermilk Biscuits-I was thinking the other day about southern cooking and I realized I hadn't made my spicy fried chicken, one of my favorite recipes, for quite a while. Recipe here Spicy Fried Chicken I made homemade ranch dressing with buttermilk and decided to make some buttermilk biscuits since I had some leftover. This is a great recipe really simple from a blog I follow and they have really great flaky layers. I served with homemade apple butter and homemade peach jam. Recipe here as well Homemade Buttermilk Biscuits I did roll them a little bit too thin but they were still delicious! That was spicy chicken was awesome. Soaking it in the buttermilk really makes the difference. I mix the flour and spices, set up next to a cast iron skillet-Fry on high, 3-5 minutes per side, then into a hot oven (see recipe)-Looking good!"},
{"title": "Dynamic Decorating & Beachy/ Camping Themes, First Tomatoes!", "date": "Jul 22, 2020", "text": "Dynamic Decorating & Beachy/ Camping Themes-Years ago I read about the concept\" dynamic decorating\". The short versions is- move things around once in a while. Sometimes things can get stale around the house. I've always loved bringing nature inside- pumpkins and corn in Autumn, cozy winter decor with snowmen, green things or flowers for Spring, then Summer decor. Since a lot of my decorating goodies were thrifted I don't spend a lot of money. If I get tired of things after a few years I can also donate them. I've seen too many people who buy more and more stuff and it gets to be on the edge of hoarding. When I worked with high poverty families in my school there was a pattern of just buying stuff- the latest technology, more stuff on the walls, floors, ceiling and it all gathered dust. And bills went unpaid. Generational patterns can be hard to break. I tried to teach my kids that. Not too much stuff! Negative space, in art, is having something blank for you eyes to rest on. Great idea, and I try and not overdo it. One of the great things about having storage is being to take things down and put other things up for a while. There are things I don't take down, like my favorite antique print my Aunt gifted me with long ago, The Angelus by Millet, hangs over our couch in the living room-  and a photo of my Grandfather Alva on top of Mt. Hood in Oregon doing military training for WW1. He was the one positive male relationship in my life growing up so he's honored there. It hangs in our main hallway. I re-used the frame from another family member, Dave got the print enlarged and curved with the curved glass frame to fit- I've blogged about my general decorating style here My French Scandinavian Country Decor for more photos. Today I got out my beachy themed decor and camping shelf items. I blogged about this idea before, link here DIY Upcycled Thrifted Camping  Summer Decor- on my dining room shelves- Living room entertainment center- Beachy theme starting on kitchen windowsill- Love my thrifted seashell frame, glass on both sides, and you can rotateBeach table in the living room-I brought out this older print I hadn't used in years. We won in a raffle 20+ years ago, Dave made the frame for me- Beach table-Added my new thrifted lobster! Also added two big seashells I got at Goodwill months ago- On our living room window I added our memory jar I made last fall from our family vacation to the Oregon coast. I made one for each of my girls as well. Everything was collected from the beach except the beach glass, I added for color- First Tomatoes!I made a simple salad with our two first tomatoes! I added sliced cukes, red onion, our fresh organic Basil and creamy Trader Joe's Feta cheese. Yummy topped with a little olive oil, balsamic vinegar and fresh ground pepper.  Goes great with anything! We had it with spicy chicken and watermelon. Lots more on the vine and TONS of Lemon Cucumbers, my favorite!!!"},

They have tons of free information! I read this article Milkwood Thermal Cooking photos courtesy their website. There's a fascinating history going back quite a while, you bring foods to a boil and then put them into a hay filled box. Basically a non-electric, heavily insulated box. Some of the photos show you can make an insulated bag with a lid and use that instead. I may look into buying one of the insulated containers, see below.  I'm pricing styrofoam beads and I might make one instead. Good idea for all kinds of reasons! Bring food to a boil, put into insulated container, walk away, come back later, food is cooked!    Best Lemon Cake! I made this for 4th of July, amazing. I've made this for decades, recipe here- East 62nd Street Lemon Cake  I garnished with fresh lemon slices! Keeps well up to a week, very moist and not too sweet.Graduation-The chicks have been doing really well outside and have gotten pretty big. After about four or five days being integrated with the big hens they started playing in the coop! I thought that was sign that they were getting comfortable being out there. We still have the little condo set up gives them a separate shadier area, but they're using the coop more and more-Roosting during the dayUp on the top at nightThey were so small when we started out!Landscaping A Narrow Area-After we added our new stone walkway this bed basically was empty. We had some ground cover, which died during construction. Dave and I wanted to add something, and I thought about getting something taller to fill the space. It's on the north side of the house and gets some sun late in the day.  I found this photo on Pinterest, from Skinny Conifers for Tight Spaces, which got me thinking- So here was our blank slate, we had already bark dusted, and Dave waves! We went to Lowe's and found quite a few 50% off plants, scored!  We bought three Emerald and Gold Euonymus (only $4.00 each!), one dwarf English Boxwood, one Green Velvet Boxwood, one Cool As Ice Fescue grass and one Emerald Spreader Yew, the large one is a Juniper, sorry lost the tag! I tried to find a nice assortment of colors, shapes and sizes to go against the light gray house paint. All of these can be pruned if they get too tall- We had one leftover plant so we added it to the bed by the coop- Hens staying cool in the mister, was 100 degrees!"},

Hope everyone is doing well where you are. Here's a peak at some of our fun Fourth of July decor, most of it thrifted!For my Independence Days Challenge here are a few different projects we've been working on...Independence Days Challenge-1. Plant Something- Nothing new to plant, still watching the garden grow.2. Harvest Something- We got our first bell pepper, eggs, herbs, Lavender. Ready to harvest- Kale and Collard greens and Blackberries are almost ready-3. Preserve/Store Something- I'm still working on doing more fermenting. Since I have a four-day weekend coming I plan on doing some more veggie batches. I'm also freezing more foods. I got some great deals on barbecue chicken parts, which I froze for the winter. Prices are cheap right now! We have pears and apples on the tree, pretty soon we'll be preserving those. Will do canning and maybe some freezing. Sadly only a handful of peaches this year, I think our 24° night that we had killed most of the blossoms. Bummer.4. Manage Reserves- Get a Good Deal/Barter/Stock Up/Prep- I found some good used books and DVDs on eBay. I bought a book with fermenting veggies recipes. Always on the lookout for good deals at the grocery store to stock up on as usual. 5. Eat the Food- Try New Foods/Recipe- I'm working on some older recipes I haven't done in a while. Last night I made this The Great Sardini Sandwich. I did add 1/2 cup chopped fresh parsley, yummy!Will be making some Muffuletta Sandwichs as those are great for hot days too! 4. Manage Reserves- Get a Good Deal/Barter/Stock Up/Prep- I found some good used books and DVDs on eBay. Always on the lookout for good deals at the grocery store to stock up on. Groceries too! 6. Build Community Food Systems- Haven't been any farmer's markets open and many of them right now are drive up only, with orders ahead of time. Have been giving extra eggs to my kids.7. Recycle/Re-Use- I repainted our bedroom curtain rod to white to match the rest of the hardware, and the trim in the room better. I used my own paint and upcycled my curtain rod by giving it a fresh coat of paint, no cost! Before picture- Painted outside-All done! I used our paint tarp on top of the chick condo to keep them dry during the rain as well as some plastic we have on hand. I have updated a few things in my work from home office to be more comfortable. I suspect this is going to be a long-term proposition but I'm happy I have a job! And they also earned PTO the time I was off on low census for my work, awesome! I had a beautiful Bluebeard shrub that we had moved to our backyard, then got overtaken by blackberries oh, so I moved it again, it survived! I was able to borrow one of my daughters old CD and radio boomboxes so I can have some tunes while I'm working. It can be pretty boring working alone in the house by myself.I will be re-painting my fave snowman sign, white paint it pretty worn, looking pretty dilapidated. I will ad some new fabric strips on the arms as well. I will use exterior house paint for durability-Dave finished up a couple of bird houses we've got to up, and the next one I'm working on painting. I got rained out! What can you do? Next to paint with house paint is this one, made from recycled cedar we had-Dave made this with recycled cedar and a Utah licence plate-Dave got a spare pulley (bottom) and made a round birdhouse. It has a spoon for a perch. I bought the vintage funnel on eBay, $10.00, cute!                                    8. Skill Up- still working on my Retrosuburbia book for more ideas for our lot. Thinking about having a keyhole garden added on an existing flower bed in the front yard to add strawberries. I'd like to get more edibles into the front yard.9. Regenerate What is Lost/SalvageSomething- We currently have some hard water spots on our two front windows, so I have decided to scrub them down with some Lime Away. We did this at my one daughter's house and it worked great. Their windows were much worse than ours. I started thinking that I'm looking out through water stains all day, at work in my home office. Should be easy to fix. We sprayed on Lime Away on the glass, after we watered down the plants below first to protect them. Next we scrubbed the lime away and I'll let it sit for a few minutes, next to rinse it off and see if you need to repeat. Pretty cheap fix.Monday we're having Stanley Steamer come over and clean our carpets and couch. They did a great job a few years ago, just a lot of wear and tear. I wish we could afford to get hardwood through the whole house, but that's not going to happen. We have a really excellent Flexsteel couch that's just needing a good cleaning. Since they're coming anyway I'm going to have them do it!We're currently looking at a way of rebuilding our existing coop without tearing the whole thing down. Most of the wood structure is still in pretty good shape, but it's the base it's the problem. We decided we don't really want to spend the money to tear the whole thing down, start over and have to move it to another location on the yard. So we may go ahead and bolster up the foundation, adding a stone/brick floor with dirt on top to keep the chickens from digging down so far. The chickens digging down into the soil is what's destabilizing a base. Time will tell..."},

Chick Ark and Garden Progress", "date": "Jun 29, 2020", "text": "Record Rain and Cold for June!We got into the nineties two days ago and then this morning it was 48 degrees and pouring rain. A high of 60 degrees. A cold front blew in last night with some rain, thunder and a little lightning. This is getting kind of old! While I love having the greenery it's been challenging doing things outside. Neighbor's deck this morning-Forecast this week-Big storm today-  Chick Ark and Garden Progress-I had our little girl chicks out in the garden after they \"graduated\" from being inside. Dang weather. We built a great little enclosure, separated from the two hens, hawk proof, to get everyone acclimated-Yesterday I debated on either locking them up in the big coop with the big hens, but I thought there might be some aggression issues. Heavy rain was on the way. They've only had a few times out in the main garden with the big girls! Dang weather!I decided to just cover their enclosure to keep them as dry as possible last night. It looked pretty funky but it seemed to work pretty well. This morning and afternoon after hard rain it was 90% dry inside. I used the painting tarp over the big tomato teepee area and then added wired-down clear plastic sheeting over most of the rest of it-Girls nice and dry on upper deck, pine shavings and dirt dry below-In the garden it's definitely is green from all this rain! The cabbages are doing great-Kale ready to eat! Tomatoes on the other side growing fast!!! It is supposed to be in the 90's for my four-day weekend for 4th of July, happy dance! What's your weather doing???"},
{"title": "Summer and Chick Condo, Day Trip, Windmill, Bees & A Basket", "date": "Jun 22, 2020", "text": "Chick Condo-Summer is finally here I think! It was 87 yesterday and finally harvested our first radishes this week!Yard is looking great and deck finally cleaned off-We've kept our turf since it's so shady and the grand kids love to play there. If it was sunny I'd have other plans for it!  It was about time to finally be able to get the chicks outside. With the unstable weather and the pouring rain on the weekends we just couldn't do it before then. They've gotten to be the right size, feathered out and pretty spunky! Chicks generate tons of dust and they were in my \"office\". Boy did I deep clean later!!!  We were out of town Saturday on a day trip, so Sunday Dave and I designed and built a little temporary condo for them. Basically they stay outside for about a week so while the two older hens can get used to them and vice versa. Nobody gets killed, life is good. This system works really well and I've done it several times before. Basically I asked Dave to build it in about the same area we have before-Scrap wood setting up in place, keep them out of the veggiesIt's up against or cedar fence that goes into the easement behind our house. I saved some scrap cardboard from a large box, we had scrap OSB, cedar boards and lots of leftover chicken wire. Basically Dave and I cobbled together a little condo area with pine shavings in the shelter and the rest of it a little run. Basically it's triangular-shaped. We had to go around a tomato. Using my long cardboard I saved, adding chicken wire. We also covered the top with chicken wire to keep hawks out-Added pine shavings under the roof  Food and water set upThey enjoyed the indoor area this afternoon, siesta time-They have shade and shelter and if we get any heavy rains this week I'll put them into the coop, separate them or bring them inside. There's a chance of some thunderstorms Wednesday night so I'm going to watch the weather closely. A few sprinkles would be fine but not if it's pouring rain. They seemed to do pretty well the first afternoon, so I decided to leave them out overnight since it was only supposed to be 65 degrees, not too cold. I went out this morning, they were in the pine shavings in the sheltered corner and I said \"where's Mommy's little girls?\" They all came running out and started eating and drinking. Life is good!Day Trip-With all of the Covid craziness Dave and I really needed to get out of town for the day. We tried going the last two weekends, but we got rained out big time.  This weekend it was supposed to be mild and possible sprinkles. So we drove up to McCall up in the mountains where there's lots of trees, water, very green and beautiful. It was a nice drive up Hiway 55,  a winding road along a river up to the mountains and trees-Hitting the flat part of the valley, pastures and cattle here and there, cloudy, no rain- It started drizzling just a little bit outside of McCall, but it was about 70 degrees and mild. Coming into town you hit a tee where the Payette Lake is straight ahead and the hotel on the right is where we've stayed for anniversary in the past-They had a cool old Range Rover in front! Dave thought it's the same make and model that's in the BBC series Rosemary and Thyme- We had our usual lunch at McCall Brewery, great food! Later in the day we stopped at Stacy's Cakes, an amazing bakery! We got some desserts to go for that night. I love their menu and sign! We drove around the back of the lake, took some photos and a beautiful whitetail deer crossed the road in front of us, sorry no photo, happened too fast-Funny to me on a certain level, fresh air used to be good for you!We stopped at a little thrift store that we've been to before and I scored some fun items! For my beach table and wall, total $3.00-$1.50 for flowers-We stopped at the McCall Store and I got Dave a new tee-shirt for Father's Day and scored some local Huckleberry syrup-We needed a new back door mat, our was trashed. I found this really gorgeous one at the local Ace Hardware store, love the design! McCall is an affluent resort type of town so they always has always have some fancy-schmancy things. Twice as thick as any I've ever seen before, longer too, hopefully will last a long time- Heavily knotted When we left McCall we took the back route home on Hiway 95, thru gorgeous valleys, then farms, ranches and the flat lands. It's a hour longer drive but a much easier drive-We had burritos on the way home and crashed. Great day, glad we went! Windmill, Bees & A Basket-Some fun scores lately! Recently I bought a sweet little windmill from LTD Commodities for the garden! It was $20.00 and heavy steel, happy dance. Then at Joann's Fabrics I bought a little clearance-priced framed bees print, $6.00, about 12\" x 12\", cute, hangs in the dining room-and a little basket for the floor next to my end of the couch, on sale $10.00 -"},

Progress With Chicks", "date": "Jun 16, 2020", "text": "Near Record Rain/ Lightning Strike-So far this month we have had near record rainfall! The weeds are loving it but it has just been too wet. We had a really severe thunderstorm come through Saturday dumping a huge amount of rain. Because it was really hot and then a cold front come through we had really awful thunder and lightning as well. The winds were whipping, I got up Saturday morning about 7 a.m. or so and the thunder was really really loud. I got up and came out and watched the thunder and lightning from the living room.At one point I heard what sounded like a close explosion and Anya (our cat) jumped up about a foot or two straight off the floor into the air! No kidding, never saw her do that before. I was afraid our tree had been hit, or one of the neighbor's, or a structure.  I couldn't see anything. The next day my husband Dave found out from the neighbor right next to us that their driveway had been hit by lightning. There was a nice big scorched area, no photo sorry. I think that's the first lightning explosion I have ever heard and it was really really loud! Luckily we are all okay. As we speak today it is pouring rain again and all of 58 degrees. Supposed to be 93 by Sunday, here's hoping!Bees Love Lavender! My lavender that I was able to winter-over has been getting visits from bees! I went out last week and stood very still, took photos of the two or three that were pollinating it. I was able to get pretty close. Bees are in such sharp decline in the United States that is wonderful to be able to provide some home habitat easily and beautifully!Progress With Chicks- The chicks are doing really great! They are getting big and have feathered out-It had been too cold and wet to start getting them outside. Its supposed to be pretty warm by Sunday so I'm going to start getting them out in the daytime. They can look and stretch their legs out. We have an old, thrifted ($1.00) outdoor playpen that works great covered with bird netting to protect from predators. The nice thing about working from home I can put them out for a few hours and keep an eye on them. It's really great to be able to add more chicks to your flock, since for me that's definitely a part of my urban homesteading self-sufficiency mode. Even if you don't butcher your chickens, which we don't, there's so much you can do with eggs for protein! You can also sell or barter. Of course they also eat lots of bugs and weed the garden area for us. The chicks are pretty funny watching me work through the day with their little box right behind my desk. I got a couple of little windows in the box and they are really fascinated I can tell. Who knows what's going on in their little pea brains?This is Ellie from six years ago as a chick-CuteThen later-Only done once for a photo op, no poop on my shoulder!"},

One of those things was getting our last window some insulated curtains. All the others in the house were good. I hung the new curtains on the old, skinny rod-I spent hours trying to find some insulated curtains for the house. They're energy efficient and great at keeping the house cooler in the summer and warmer in the winter. See post here Investing Money For Homesteading/Life   I finally got a rod, from Overstock.com after Amazon fell thru, and Dave installed it-The rod is a shabby chic distressed white. I never did like the grommets on the curtains, so I decided to flip the curtains upside down, and use the hem as the top.  I then measured how much fabric to remove. I bought the curtains longer than needed since the reviews said they shrank. Next I removed the grommets and hemmed the edges- Next measured a 1\" hem to match the side hems-Pressed and pinned in place-Had matching thread, used the sewing machine, only took about 15 minutes! Came out nice!!!All done!Next I found a great $15.00 silver rod locally (Ross) for my other mini upgrade-Sad skinny wood rod, what I could afford years agoNew rod, so much better in scale and dresses it up!Last one to do, just doing a white paint job, now that the rain has stopped!"},
{"title": "Independence Days Challenge- Covid Edition", "date": "Jun 4, 2020", "text": "Independence Days Challenge- Covid Edition-I thought I'd do some updating of various projects and this list is a good way to organize things! Join in, post on your blog if you like! FYI I didn't invent this list, several other bloggers were doing this for quite a while over the years. Here's the recent Independence Days Challenge- Covid Edition... 1. Plant Something- We just planted a row of Blue Lake bush green beans, a patch of small mixed pumpkins and several kinds of Italian \"frying\" peppers on the south side of the house. Used to be a spot for the old shed we tore down. I finally found some of the peppers at a local greenhouse, happy dance! The varieties we planted are Marconi, Giant Marconi and Jimmy Nardello.  The peppers are long, sweet. They're great stuffed, topped with marinara sauce, or add to pasta sauce and freezes well. Great addition to the garden-Our poor tomatoes have finally perked up with the hotter weather.  I saw that Seed Savers Exchange had free shipping so I bought some Radio Calendula seeds to plant, looks like this, love the spikes! I planted a whole big flower pot full! Photo from Seedsavers.orgI finally planted my new flower box Dave built with Basil and some local Calendula-2. Harvest Something- Eggs, Basil, Chives. Too early for summer veggies yet. 3. Preserve/Store Something- Two batches of fermented veggies, Sauerkraut and Carrots w/ Ginger and garlic. Froze some meats. I'm going to do an inventory of the freezer soon. I may can some of our frozen apples. 4. Manage Reserves- Get a GoodDeal/Barter/Stock Up/Prep- Bought some seeds with free shipping from Seedsavers.org for next year. Bought some Brats from Costco to freeze, got a great coupon deal for canned cat food. Anya barfs if she eats dry, so the Vet said to switch. We did, little vomiting and she lost weight, which was good! The Vet said dry food has way too many carbs, no wonder. She's also more active!5. Eat the Food- Try NewFoods/Recipe- Ditto fermented goods. Eating some meals from freezer foods. 6. Build Community Food Systems- Nothing at this time. Hope to sell extra eggs at some point in the late fall/winter, when the new girls start laying. Five chickens in production, look out!!!7. Recycle/Re-Use- Dave built a cedar planting box from an old planter my daughter was going to throw away. I told how how big big and he built it! All free.  We gave away a tote of leftover river rock from the path prep thru Free Craigslist. The woman is using as border for a community garden! Happy to help with that! Dave brought home two boxes from work for the chicks. I start the first week with a laundry basket, then move to a larger box. Next I combine two boxes for a larger space. They'll be outside soon, hopefully in a few weeks, slowly integrating to the flock. Feathering out and weather are the factors.  The shredded bark that was dumped here with our purchased gravel we re-used in the garden for mulch, mostly gravel free. 8. Skill Up- Still working on the Retrosuburbia book, love it! Learning lots of Australian slang! Dave and I did research, he got our new walkway in, looks and works great! 9. Regenerate What is Lost/SalvageSomething- Our flock! We bought our three new chicks, all growing well! From the left- Debbie, Sunny and Luna I bought a new curtain rod online, the finial was broken off on arrival. Since it was a clean break I decided to glue it back together. Will never show, will touch up if needed-It's a fun, shabby chic distressed finish-It's going to replace the too-small rod, isn't wide enough for the new curtains-My work from home \"office\"That gave me the idea to paint an existing rod in our main bedroom. It was black, which was fine. Later I added sheers and a second rod, which is white. I'll take it down and paint it white to match-Our bedroom is a light gray with white trim, so it will match better. I have tons of paint! No cost update-"},
{"title": "New Chicks! Summer Veggie Garden Planted, DIY Recycled Cedar Planter, Fermenting Success ", "date": "May 30, 2020", "text": "New Chicks! It's 96 today and hot! Summer is here finally, but going to drop 20 degrees tomorrow which will be nice. When we lost two of our hens last year I decided to buy some chicks this spring. I've learned the hard way not to buy them too early in the spring or they have to be inside a long time until they feather out and can tolerate outside temperatures. I called the local Hatchery and during the Covid-19 craziness everyone was sold out. Panic buying I think. I like to buy mine directly from a hatchery because they have a good variety, their chicks are healthy, and you know what you're buying. I've had trouble at two different local feed stores getting the wrong breed and one wasn't even a chicken! The good news was the hatchery was able to take an order a month out from me. So basically ordered three chicks mid late April for late May. I took a little vacation time on Wednesday, went out and picked up the chicks. These are pullets which mean they are baby hens. One is a brown leghorn (no name yet), one is a Silver Laced Wyandotte which I have named Luna, the other is a Red Sex Link Debbie. They LOVE the mirror in the basket! All happy and healthy under their red heat lamp-Luna in the middle named for her silver color to come, brown leghorn on the right. Debbie on the left named for the space-faring chicken in the new Lost In Space-Lucky Debbie with Don West (actor Ignacio Serricchio), resident hunk!I'll start getting them outside soon, depending on the weather and then integrate them to the flock slowly. Happy to have more girls to add! More eggs on the horizon, will probably start selling some eventually. My post here shows the photos of adult hens colors,  New Chicks Coming!Summer Veggie Garden Planted-After a really bizarre April and May we finally got all of the summer veggies planted that we had on Memorial Day. We didn't have enough tomato cages so I asked Dave to rip some old cedar boards to create tepees for the tomatoes. He did that and it worked out great!Dave used our thrifted mini table saw, works great! I bought some new rabbit fencing to put around the base of the tomatoes and peppers. This works as a cage for the tomatoes and keeps the chickens out. It's easy to manipulate, cut, and stores well. I realized ours was about seven or eight years old and was just a mess. So for two rolls for $25 it was a good solution-After my fail X 2 with seeds in the cold frame I added purple and green cabbages and Kohlrabi's-Mr bushytail chilling in the heat! I'm thrilled my French Lavender topiary survived the winter, under four layers of row cover. It's now covered with flowers, just starting to open!!!Speaking of summer, we had our first barbecue in a few years! I kept forgetting to bring it out (in garage), but we had yummy burgers, grilled green onions, chips and lots of veggies!And speaking of more summer, I put out some sunny yellow decor in the kitchen/dining room-DIY Recycled Cedar Planter-Since we still have some cedar lumber left after the veggie stakes were cut, I asked Dave to build another flower box for me. He asked how big and off he went-I just need to add the basil starts and flowers, weather proof, perfect!Fermenting Success-I made two batches of fermented foods, one with my new Masontops kit. The first batch I used their sauerkraut recipe and my existing jar with airlock top. The second batch I made was fermented carrots with fresh thin sliced ginger and garlic. I was really excited to make two batches simultaneously! Mid way the kraut had a little bit of stuff on the top, but not much, so I skimmed it off. I also added a little bit more brine. I think the issue was some of the tiny pieces of cabbage floated up above the weights. Next time I will leave in a large cabbage leaf under the weights. Never had this problem with the Curtido, I think there was more mass. When it was done there was what looked like a Scoby on top, similar to what you see on top of Kombucha. It had no odor so I threw it out. I checked on the sauerkraut which tasted fine! Since I'm really only making it for myself I'm not worried about any kind of problems. I ate some and it was nice and crunchy! The carrots came out well, with a little tiny bit of scum on the top of the brine which I skimmed off. I tasted the carrots and they were crunchy and slightly spicy. The fresh raw ginger and fresh raw garlic definitely gives it some kick! I will definitely do those recipes again.Carrots going intop on, worked great venting! Close up Chilling in the fridge, the brine will get clearer in a few days"},
{"title": "Rain Rain Went Away! New DIY Walk Way Done", "date": "May 27, 2020", "text": "Rain, Rain Went Away!The weather the last month or two has been kind of crazy. We had warm weather (87),  then cold, (38) then warm, then cold, then cold. Last Wednesday we had record-breaking rain, 1.2 in in the Boise area. I was working that day from home and looking out thinking maybe our house was going to start rising and float away! My poor seedlings almost drowned-I put the chickens in mid-morning because they were soaked, locked up the coop and gave them a snack-I figured two hours later I could let them out, but it was still pouring!!! Finally about 5:00 pm or so it started drying up and I let them out. Everything was super saturated. The rain stopped the next day, just a sprinkling. The low Thursday was supposed to be 38 degrees. Yes you read that right 38 freaking degrees at the end of May. There is something wrong with this picture. We covered up our tomatoes and peppers that were outside already. I'm really glad we didn't plant everything else at that point. It's in the 70's this week, 81 today so hopefully this is the end of the cold rainy weather. However one never knows. I don't feel too bad as I know people in the Midwest and the East Coast are getting slammed by tornadoes, floods, etc. Other sad news is it appears there is only a handful of peaches on our peach tree. I suspect one of the evenings when it dipped into the 20's after the tree has blossomed pretty well killed most of them. The good news is we have lots of apples and lots of pears! I think I have a few frozen peaches left from last year, so I may hold out on those as long as possible.New DIY Walk Way Done-Last December we went and visited my husband's family in Portland, Oregon. We saw how my brother-in-law had his garden path redone in his backyard with crushed stone. We had a high-traffic pathway of round pea gravel on the north side of our house that is always a mess, even with all of the pavers we added years ago. Sadly round pea gravel moves around a lot-buried paversDave always wanted to redo it with something else and we went back and forth about what to use? One of the problems with the pea gravel it was always moving around making it a pain to take out wheelbarrows, mower,  garbage, recycling and city composting. Then there's bringing things in! After I saw the material that my brother-in-law had installed I told Dave that's what we should use! The same exact materials weren't available here. It was actually a lot cheaper than most of the other materials we could have bought, the whole thing came around $300.00 for three yards and renting a small and large tamper. We felt it was a good home investment for the long term. We rented a small tamper to basically smash the stone into place for compaction-It was for the long stretch on the North side of the house, the small area in front of the gate going into that, and the entrance going into the veggie garden. We had the delivery done Friday as Dave took the day off. The broken edges of the crushed stone are really key as once it is laid down, tamped and watered as it won't go anywhere. We will be reusing the pavers somewhere else, possibly is the floor for the new coop we're thinking about building. Nice thing about crushed stone is it also lets the water go through it. It's permeable. It's also slightly rough so if it gets icy on that side of the house, which it occasionally does, we will still have good traction.Here's the steps to doing this- First measure the area several times. Figure out how many yards you'll need, price, color, etc. It pays to shop around! We scheduled delivery since the truck we could borrow couldn't handle 4 tons! There are online converters to convert from square feed to yards. Here's the prep...First remove the old gravel and soil- Most of the excess soil went into the various flower and veggie beds-Next decide on your edging, we chose pressure treated wood, nice and natural looking. Measure and cut your lengths-Temporary storageBuild and install your edging, using common galvanized nails, we used survey stakes, cheap and re-usable in the garden. They hold the edging in place, once stone's in you can pull them out -Level as best as you can-Delivery time!!!We also got some shredded bark in the mix, oh joy! Dave separated the mulch as best he could, there was much more than we thought!I did call the stone place we bought the rock from and complained that we wound up having 2 large garbage totes full of the mulch! I let them know we weren't very happy. Driver should have checked his truck before loading, wound up being a real mess! Next start adding rock to the path, rake as you go, after doing half water well. Next tamp down, do other 1/2. Water and tamp down again!Dave did the entrance to the garden and then the entrance into the coop, both of which tended to get pretty muddy- BeforeIt was also uneven after years of sinking in. Dave went and bought a couple more pieces of lumber to frame in the areas-I suggested we widen the path, good idea!So after Dave Tamped down the first layer watered it and let it sit overnight next he added the second layer of crushed stone. Watered it in and tamped it down. It turned out to be pretty loose still. After doing some research we decided it would be best to rent a steel gas powered tamper that we can press the stone a lot more and leave a much firmer surface. So the next day we went back to the rental place to pick the BIG one up. It looks like this-It weighed a few hundred pounds and was very tricky to unload out of our Outback. We used two 2 x 4's  (my idea) to push it back up when done. NOT FUN, more of a 3-4 person lift!Dave did the path several times, then we took back to the rental place, Dave watered well. All in all we love it! Dave did a great job, with me contributing more ideas.All done!There was a little mulch mixed in the rock in the two small areas, but we can live with it. It will bio-degrade over time. We'll use the 2 totes of mulch in the garden. Rosie the hen came to inspect-"},

It was tough not being able to go to his burial but we made it thru... On a happier note I was thrilled to receive flowers that were delivered for Mother's Day from my one daughter. One of my other daughter's surprised me with a DVD I had always wanted and never gotten around to buying! Mother's Day was nice, we got some amazing takeout Mexican food for dinner, a nice treat. We also started planting our store bought veggies (finally!) for the summer and some of the seeds I planted are coming up-Two kinds of radishes, green onions, will thin radishesBorageCollard greensIt was 87 yesterday that was kind of crazy! Luckily it will moderate but I think summer is here hopefully. Didn't really tough starting seeds outside the last two months because of the ups and downs with the weather. We planted most of our veggies I bought I while back. I wasn't sure if there's be a shortage, so I bought early. I put them in our mini indoor greenhouse-They loved it!One cherry tomato was almost 3 feet long!!!I took some of the seedlings I started and put in bigger pots for now, want to til they're just a bit bigger, Lemon Cukes (can't find any starts) and green squash- Herb box and other plants doing well, need to bring out BasilWe planted 10 tomatoes total, five more to go, as we ran out of cages. Also four peppers. I asked Dave to build some tepee-type frames out of our scrap cedar lumber. These supports are on their last legs, will build new ones next year out of better wood- Extra tall tomato is happy!Three more on the side, will add more peppers, old berry plants were ripped out-Rest of the garden will get squashes, three kinds of cukes and more warm weather veggies- Kale is doing great, has doubled in size!I bought some red cabbages and purple Kohlrabi to try-They look interesting! Sometimes called Sputniks like the satellites!Photo from Motherearthnews.com info there too!I belong to the Facebook group RetroSuburbia Community. I highly recommend the group, tons of ideas there! A member, Kath, mentioned that she tries to do\"one future food activity each day whether planting, or preserving, bulk cooking, harvesting, dehydrating, etc.\" I really liked the wording, and it helped me focus on that as a great goal.  It made something that might seem complicated much easier! I took her statement, added a free piece of clip art and printed it out. A little mini poster for myself. I put it over my kitchen sink where I can see it everyday since I'm a visual person! It inspires and motivates me. I thanked her as well-Fermenting Kraut & New Fermenting Kit- Quite a few years ago I bought a Vegetable Master Half Gallon Fermenting Jar , see above. While it works great I can only do one batch at a time which can take weeks. With two of us I was wanting to start make more smaller batches. I decided to buy a Masontops Fermenting Kit, link on the left side of my blog-Normally I'm not a kit kind of gal BUT when I saw it included four glass weights and a pounder I was sold! These items will fit standard wide mouth jars and rings that you already have. The silicone nipples burp out and release the gas from fermenting, insuring no spoilage, ditto the glass weights-Nice, thick glass, keep things submerged in the brineSilicone venting top, can't see the X on the topI ordered from my local Ace Hardware store to help support them (same price elsewhere). I'm really impressed with the quality and love the heavy storage box! Great to store when not in use. Comes with a nice basic recipe book as well-I wanted to make a big batch of kraut so started in my old jar, two heads cabbage and this recipeCulturesforhealth Sauerkraut It's always messy making slaw but worth it. Several years ago I bought a cheap mandolin to shred quickly and easily-Add salt, toss, squash with your hands, then pound!Nestled away in fermenting jar, top with a large cabbage leaf, then weights. I waited two hours after this photo, then completely submerged the cabbage leaves and weights. Usually the jar is full to the top- Dated, then covered, will wait about 10 -14 days and check flavor-I've made Curtido several times, amazing! That will be my next big batch-Mojo Cuban Pork Roast & Cuban Sandwich-I had seen the movie Chef  a while back, amazing food and cooking scenes! I found this recipe based on the film's recipe Cuban Mojo Pork Roast I decided to make it, for something different. The flavor was incredible! Really juicy, a nice blend of citrus and cumin. It's easy to blend all the ingredients in a food processor, then bag and let sit overnight-I took the suggestion and then made her Cuban Sandwich Cubanos also from the movie. I made them for dinner and served with some veggies. I would say the sandwich was good, but not great, but that's okay. At least I know what they taste like now! Sorry no photos, but you can see some on the blog listed above. It was the first time I used my cast iron skillet on top of a sandwich to create a sort of Panini. I gave me the idea to do that again next time with some different ingredients. I used my regular skillet on the bottom, parchment paper on top of the sandwiches, then my heavy cast iron skillet on top. Works great had a really crispy crust! Will be making the roast again this week with a boneless roast!"},

Coming from a family of five, with Dave the youngest, he was the next oldest. He passed away at home with his loved ones after a long chronic illness. Not Covid related. He survived longer than the doctors told him he would. Due to the Covid situation we were not able to go to the burial in Washington state. When things normalize more there will be a memorial we can go to. We had a Zoom \"meeting\" with everyone sharing their best memories of him last night. One was of his 80+ day bike trip across America back when he was young, in 1976. It was to celebrate the Bicentennial. He was a great guy, kind, quiet, very devoted to his family, worked for the Forest Service most of his life building roads and bridges. He leaves behind 2 great adult kids and his wife. We will miss him..."},

It's been milder here, low 70's, then rained this morning, sun's out now. We're headed for 80+ degrees for Wednesday, then cooler the next day by 15 degrees. We took off our row cover on the cold frame Saturday and added elevated bird netting. We found three of my butter lettuces were gone, one cabbage and most of the seedlings either died or were eaten by bugs. Bummer. That's a huge Comfrey in back, will divide and make some Comfrey tea for fertilizer!Mixed lettuce survivor, Mizuna, Japanese Mustard GreensLuckily I had leftover seeds so we replanted most of it. Fingers crossed!David ripped out the dying shrub for me and so I planted a patch of Borage, and herb that is very medicinal, edible, a pollinator, leaves taste like cucumber and it's a great food for chickens! It has pretty blue flowers, tough and drought resistant. I couldn't figure out what to plant in that spot and then Borage came to mind when I saw some seeds. It's really a good fit, pretty flowers, also called Star Flower-From Wiki BorageFrom Permaculturenews.orgThey'll fill in the space nicely and we can use for edibles ourselves or for the chickens. If you've never heard of it read up, it's amazing! I made a big sign so I won't forget to water it-Grow babies!Our other area where Dave removed the non-productive raspberries got planted. I composted and planted two kinds of radishes, small carrots, bunching green onions and collard greens. I decided not to plant Collards any until I saw the new Somewhere South show on PBS with chef Vivian Howard. After seeing some of her recipes, as well as other people's recipes, I decided to grow some again. I see Collard Kraut in my future! Clean slate after pulling raspberries-Get mostly sun in the summer, with some after noon shade-I thought about moving our lovely bamboo but was afraid I'd kill it, so it's staying. Adds some nice winter interest.Seeds planted On the other side of the Bamboo I planted some Kale starts. We put bird netting over them as well. At this point we're out of bird netting so we'll have to buy some more if needed. It's funny that the birds will eat the small leafy vegetables but pretty much leave them alone when they get big-Our biggest challenge is working around our huge Maple tree we love! It's on the West side of the house and gives us tons of shade in the summer! We had it trimmed a few times and thinned more on the side over the veggie bad. It's just one of those things! Love our tree!!!I let the hens out to free range our side yard, after Dave and I moved the tomato cages and extra chicken wire. Late yesterday Dave deep cleaned and weeded. We'll be planting Blue Lake bush beans again there, they did great last year! Had our last bag of frozen home grown beans last night-Field trip!Chicks Coming!Speaking of chickens.... Locally all of the chicks for sale have been flying out of the stores, so to speak! I couldn't quite decide if I wanted to buy more chicks or not since our two older ones (6 years old) are laying pretty productively right now. We lost two of our new pullets last fall that we had a dog get in our yard. Given the current state of world affairs I decided to buy three more to boost the flock numbers. I called a hatchery that we usually buy from, Dunlap's in Caldwell, and they were selling out really fast and kind of unpredictably. After I called them I found out that I could place an order a month out, which would be great! Since you can't just put baby chicks outside it would be great to have them inside as little as possible, since the weather will be warmer in June. After looking at their stock here is what I ordered...I one Golden Sex Link, a hybrid, had one before, nice birds-and one Brown Leghorn, great layers-and one Silver Laced Wyandotte, gorgeous birds! I like to get a mix of breeds so I can tell the hens apart in case of injury or disease. I'll pick up the end of May. They'll be inside until they mature and feather out, then transition to outdoor and integrate to the flock. More eggs will be good to share with our kids, or barter, depending on how life goes."},

{"title": "Happy Earth Day! Investing Money For Homesteading/Life", "date": "Apr 22, 2020", "text": "Happy Earth Day! Investing Money For Homesteading/Life-Dave and I are blessed to be working (from home) and I get paid on the low work days when I'm not needed. With our \"stimulus money\" I had been thinking ahead to some home/homestead investments we might do. I'll add here, I don't get any kickbacks from these company's, just sharing where I bought them.First- I was lucky to be able to do an out of state library loan of the Retrosuburbia book last year. I could only keep it for two weeks, way too short!  At $85.00 I couldn't justify buying it at the time. Recently I found out they have a U.S. distributor and the author lowered the price during Covid times for more access. I ordered a copy today for $62.00 as a \"investment\". It's worth every penny in my opinion. The author David Holmgren is a very well-versed Permaculture teacher and innovator. The book is filled with amazing color photos, diagrams and info for the beginner and more! They have a great Facebook page under the same name, great before and after projects, lots of new members, great advice, all free. Check out the great book trailer here-Description from US.permacultureprinciples.com where you can buy the book- This 592 page manual shows how people can downshift and retrofit their homes, gardens, communities and, above all, themselves to be more self-organized, sustainable and resilient into an uncertain future. It promises a challenging but exciting mix of satisfying work, a more meaningful way of living and hope for the next generation. Holmgren has written the book deliberately with an southern Australian focus, drawing heavily on his own direct experience. The concepts and actions can be applied in most suburban environments. RetroSuburbia is divided into three main sections: the Built, the Biological and the Behavioral along with the introductory section ‘Setting the scene’.Next on the list- I been wanting a garden hod (basket)  for washing our home grown produce outside. Keeps the soil out of the kitchen! I'd seen some wood ones, most very expensive. Making one wasn't in the cards right now, time constraints. I found this one, which is collapsible, and love the design! $30.00 for the medium size. I bought at Gardeners.com, I've bought a few odd things over the years with good quality. Three colors to choose from-Next on the list- Our one bedroom is the last one to not have insulated curtains. We have wide, heavy plastic blinds that came with the house. I added a soft sheer curtain as a swag to soften it-After spending about 3 hours online I decided to get these insulated curtains. This is the same company that we've bought all our other curtains from. They last for years, wash well, hang to dry on the rod. They have a great bonded lining, unlike cheaper ones. I found this pattern, to soften up the room. It'll will be much shorter to fit the window. With light sage green walls, ditto sage carpeting, and white trim, I wanted something light with a floral pattern. I found cream with blue flowers, a nice design.  It will keep the room much cooler in the summer, and warmer in the winter. The room faces East and South, on a corner. After pictures coming soon!From Plow and HearthWe'd already bought two more grow lights, to add to our bedroom mini greenhouse, which has been great. Seeds started on the top shelf with old lights doing well- These peppers took 5 weeks to sprout!!! Knowing there might be a run on some veggie starts later I found some various tomatoes, peppers and Nasturtiums today.  I bought these from a local feed supply store D and B Supply  I even found a pony pack with four tall tomatoes for $3.00!Since it's too cold to put plant I added them to the mini greenhouse, tucked in warm and cozy, under the two new lights. We'll wait a few more weeks til it warms up to move outside-I planted my slicing cucumber seeds and added those, using a recycled milk jug bottom-There's a few other random things I'm thinking of to \"invest\" in. Still adding more dry goods, like beans, which have been hard to find. I FINALLY found yeast last week! Score! I can finally make some yeast breads. I'll be stocking up on canning supplies as well, who knows how the food chain will go out a ways?"},

I took off our heavy comforter a few days ago and switched to a blanket and quilt. The pollen count is horrendous, itchy eyes and sneezing time, but it will pass. I love being home and listening to the birds and the sound of the pond (Dave filled) gurgling. I'm off work today, but yesterday worked with my window open, had fresh air, so nice. A while back this recipe jumped out at me when I watched Jamie Oliver's show on PBS. This show has only 5 Ingredients Recipes Having our own eggs again, finally, I decided to make it Egg Mango Chutney Flatbreads, I used Trader Joe's mango chutney and subbed red pepper flakes for the sliced red peppers. For some reason they're heard to find except in the summer. The dough was really easy, but I did add a TBL of water as I only had Greek yogurt which was thick. They fried up great, were soft and fluffy! I poached/fried my eggs, since fresh ones can be tough to peel. Smeared the flatbread with chutney, dotted with yogurt, topped with eggs, red pepper flakes, a little salt and pepper. We had this for dinner and was perfect!!! I could see making the flatbread and using different toppings- beans, leftover meats, etc. I may try making some of my own peach chutney when the peaches get ripe. June's coming! I love having an early ripening variety...Easy Berry Smoothie-Today with my breakfast poached eggs and whole grain toast I made this Berry Smoothie  I missed the ones they sold at Costco, so I looked for a knockoff. This is it! Basically 1 cup frozen mixed berries and 1/2 cup apple juice. That's all. I used a little extra juice as our frozen strawberries were huge and tough to blend. Sorry I didn't have a clear glass (no straws) but these summer glasses do! It was nice and not too sweet. I could see adding in some pineapple or protein powder for something different. Enjoy!Garden Cleanup/Barkdust-We've added lots of homemade compost over the 14 years or so we've lived here. Living in a very hot/very cold climate mulching is a must. It protects your plants, holds in moisture, protects from freezing weather and keeps down the weeds. We buy bark dust every few years, spreading over weed guard fabric. After removing the debris from winter storms it was obvious it was time-Exposed landscape fabric, yuckAfter!Dave was able to borrow a pickup truck from a friend and bought 2 yards of local bark dust. He had weeded the front yard, I did most of the back. He spread the front and I did the back. Looks great!Center flower bedMulched the 3 fruit trees tooI spent an almost hour just weeding this one bed! Added manure, compost, then the barkdust Ditto the blackberry bed, well fed and mulched!Next on the list! South side yard when we grow beans, storage for winter. I came up with the idea to store the extra chicken wire rolls in the empty compost bin. We stopped composting yearly as the soil level is getting too high. We'll empty the area and I can put the two hens in there for a few hours and let them go to town! Next we'll weed and get ready to plant beans and squash, maybe pumpkins.  Chicken food!I had Dave dig up a very sick shrub I'd tried to nurse back to health for several years. It's in the chicken shade area. It's new space to plant, to the left of the shovels-After we reorganized and build shelves in the our spare bedroom closet we didn't need this indoor/outdoor wire rack-I brought it outside and put in an area that I can't seem to grow anything. Not sure if it's the soil but everything I've planted there has died since we've lived here. I'll fill the pots with herbs, maybe some small veggies, we'll see! Moving forward with planting more foods! Hopefully the local store will have some veggies in stock, otherwise we'll see how it goes..."},

Keeps quite a while in the fridge, if it lasts that long!

Put on top hot dogs, bean whatever!Vivian Howard's Somewhere South-I always loved PBS's A Chef's Life show with Vivian Howard, leader in the farm to table restaurant movement. She's very honest, funny and charming. I stumbled onto her new show last week and love it!!! Here's the description of her show from her website-\"After five seasons of “A Chef’s Life,” chef and author Vivian Howard serves as both student and guide in “Somewhere South.” Exploring cross-cultural dishes through the professional and personal relationships she has with southerners of many backgrounds, “Somewhere South” lets viewers meet their neighbors while exploring the foods that bind and define the American South — one dish at a time \". Her new website has recipes and other things from the show Somewhere South  A link for her full episode of What A Pickle is here PBS.org What A Pickle, great ideas and looks at various foods!!!

{"title": "Online Shopping Alternatives", "date": "Apr 16, 2020", "text": "Online Shopping Alternatives-Like many people many of our local stores are shut down where I usually shop. Places like Ross, a discount store, where I usually find great deals on bedding, clothes, etc. for great prices. All our thrift stores have been shut down, not an alternative either.  We're doing lots of repairing, re-using, re-purposing as well, but that's our normal mode! Dave's favorite coffee tumbler lost it's rubber bottom today. I glued it back on! Obviously there are tons of other great online shopping places, I'll mention just a few I've used. There's a few local stores that I don't feel comfortable shopping at right now. We've been doing some online shopping at Amazon for certain specific items like specific clothing, small electronics that died, etc. I thought I'd share with you a couple of different online places that have worked out really well! After placing an order on Amazon, a week and a half went by with nothing shipped. I'm sure they're overloaded. I decided to see what my other options were. I canceled my Amazon order. I decided to try Target.com since they ship. My experience was that their website was pretty slow relative to others. I was really happy with being able to order some items, shipping is free over $35 and was delivered in 3 days. Looks like the warehouse it came from for us was in California.I was running out of my turmeric supplement that we usually get from Costco. It works great for my arthritis! I was trying to figure out how to get more. Costco has been mobbed and neither of us wanted to go in there unless it's really important. One item for me did not constitute important. I decided to look on their website, I was able to order it, get it delivered to the house in about three business days! Free shipping, same price as the store, a win-win. I did notice Costco has listed that you can order groceries and have them delivered within 2 business days. I'm not sure how that works. This is only for Costco members.Another place I've used for years is Overstock.com. It's free shipping all the time, for everything. I've bought all kinds of things there, great prices. I've never had a problem with any orders. We were down to our last set of cotton sheets and I had gotten Eddie Bauer's percale sheet there before. I LOVE their sheets!!! I love percale sheets because they're crisp and cool in the summer and they last a long time. I looked there but couldn't find any patterns I liked, so I bought a set of Nautica percale sheets. I don't mind spending more for some things because they last longer. They have soft navy blue stripes, reminds me of batik a bit-I've shopped, and sold, on eBay for years! I recently got a great, like new, hardback cookbook for $3.00, free shipping. This will give me some new ideas for cooking while in lock down mode. You can buy everything under the sun there, just check reviews on seller first-FYI, I have read recently that Ikea US is having issues with people getting notification from them on their online orders, no feedback, nothing arriving. This is on their Facebook and Twitter accounts. I'd steer clear of them for now. Hopefully they will resolve their issues soon, as I have a few things I'd like to order!Hope you all are happy and healthy and hanging in there through all of this."},
{"title": "Working From Home x 2 and Grow Lights ", "date": "Apr 11, 2020", "text": "Anya napping thru the chaosWorking From Home x 2-Sorry I've been on radio silence. Work/life has been crazy. Crazy weather also hasn't helped, snowed last week, then 72 yesterday!The last week or so I've been feeling really disconnected. Dave is too. I'm having trouble keeping track of what day it is because I haven't been going to work much the last two weeks. I got set up to work at home this last Wednesday, but then there wasn't any work for me to do after that. I'm very grateful to be paid and have benefits through all of this by my corporation. I find out at the end of every business day if I'm going to be working the next day. It's always a wait-and-see kind of thing. I was off work all week last week, except for two hours to pack up my desk, and pick up my work equipment to bring home. Basically the work I do is for a large medical organization, running insurance for office visits, and non-essential office visits are drying up. Most healthcare providers are not seeing patients for anything that's not deemed critical. So this is a wait-and-see proposition. I'm guessing this could go on for months, the question is how many? I'm just trying to do lots of things at home and stay focused, get some intellectual stimulation by watching documentaries or whatever. Dave started working from home yesterday when he brought home his technology that he needed. His company has sent home almost everyone except the shop workers. Because his business is deemed critical he will probably keep working everyday as normal but from home. He works for an industrial electric motor company that works on equipment for hospitals, municipalities and the farming industry. Lucky for us we had two spare bedrooms that we could set up easily. The one I'm using already had a small desk in it for Dave's spare computer-The other bedroom had room to set up his table he brought home. We didn't think they'd send him home to work since there's less than 10 people in his building, but they did-This is considered temporary but who knows how long temporary means? Two months, six months, 18 months? I have no clue. I'm very fortunate I'm still getting a paycheck. I know not everybody has that luxury and I'm very grateful. So far we're both healthy, our kids are healthy and our grand kids are healthy. Both my six year old hens are laying, bless their hearts! We have 2 dozen eggs now in the fridge, awesome! I try to let them out to free range every day, a few times a day-Rosie on the right, Ellie on the leftNot sure if I'll be able to get new chicks, as they are in short supply locally. A lot of people are planting gardens and buying chickens. A Victory Garden re-boot of sorts. Victory Gardens started in Canada, more info here Victory Gardens It will be good if people keep doing this after things calm down.Speaking of growing food and farming this video is interesting Helpless Farmers Devastated by Pandemic . I saw this on the news last night and shook my head. This is definitely a sign of a broken agricultural system. These farmers would rather let their food rot in the field then selling them in small batches, through social media, or giving it away. I think sometimes the old system of farmer subsidies created a helpless mentality that if there's no traditional buyer just let it rot. Time to think outside the box. Give to shelters, and food banks are already heavily hit. That could be feed for livestock animals if nothing else. This is wasteful.We planted the cold frame with seeds several weeks ago and they're coming up very slowly.  This weekend we'll be planting some other cool weather vegetables over in the main part of our garden if the weather cooperates. It's been warm but a cold front has been blowing in all day, up to 60 MPH gusts. Supposed to be in the 20's next few nights. Will plant radishes, a couple of kinds of carrots and more spinach and lettuce. Seeds that I started inside our indoor little green house in the bedroom are doing well, but some seeds aren't up yet-Top old grow light is more purpleDave found some starts for Basil and pickling cukes, the new grow light has more of a white light. I will split these up into bigger containers soon-We found a big Rosemary-Using my $3.00 thrift store teapot for watering-We decided to add two more grow light to start more veggies and flowers. We couldn't find any local stores that have grow lights but we found two on Amazon and they are great! They're actually better prices than what we could find locally, with free shipping. So we have three grow lights on the rack for the next month to help speed things up, instead of one light. Easy to install, just plug in, has rings on top to suspend from the rack-                                                                                           You can see edge of grow lightTomorrow I'll start some bush beans and slicing cucumbers on another rack.

{"title": "6.5 Earthquake Hits Idaho and Other States", "date": "Apr 1, 2020", "text": "From Ktvb.com Earthquake Rattles Idaho6.5 Earthquake Hits Idaho-Just when you think things couldn't get any more exciting during a pandemic we had an earthquake! About 5:50 pm last night I was standing in our dining room, and Dave in the bathroom, when it got really REALLY loud. The house started shaking and it took me a couple of seconds to realize that we were having a full-blown earthquake. I stood in the door way in the kitchen and Dave in the bathroom. The whole house was shaking. I noticed that our TV in the living room looked like it might fall forward and hit the floor. I walked over and stood by it and held it in place. I was away from a window, so I was probably okay, but not my smartest move. It kept going, the local National Geological Society thought it was about a minute or so. Of course it felt like longer. Dave at one point thought it had stopped, but I could feel under my feet. The room was still moving back and forth a bit and our floor lamp chain was swaying. It did freak out our poor kitty. We immediately called our kids and I texted them to warn them about aftershocks. Since I grew up in Southern California and went through a lot of earthquakes, it's not usually just one quake and then it's over. We did have an aftershock probably about 10 minutes later that I felt sitting on the couch. It was moving, and Dave was walking across the house and said he didn't feel anything. The local news reported early in the evening at least 2 aftershocks.It was centered in Central Idaho up in the mountains. Initially it was reported that there had been a big earthquake in Yellowstone but that was not correct apparently. It brought back a lot of memories of really startling earthquakes when I was a kid. I had seen china come flying out of the kitchen cabinets and windows that were broken. Luckily there was no damage to our house, garage, and coop. A few people on the news head cracked ceilings and minor structural damage. The news had a few reported gas leaks which is not a surprise, especially in some of the older areas in town. An email from my Corporation said that they had immediately inspected all their buildings and things were fine. More news here 100's of Aftershocks PossibleThe USGS said it was reportedly felt in Washington, Montana, Wyoming, Utah and Nevada. This earthquake was less than two weeks after a good sized quake hit Salt Lake City in Utah. That one was a 5.7-magnitude earthquake. My husband's company headquarters is there, which caused concern. The last big quake here was in 1983, in the mountains in Borah Peak. Hopefully we won't have any more soon!"},

More later..We are having a very wet Spring day today! The weatherman was right with lots of intermittent showers today and windy. I cleaned my windows few days ago and now they're all covered with rain, but what can you do-The rain has been a blessing since since it can dry here and every Spring is different. Our cool weather crops that we planted in the cold frame are barely up and we've only had to water them once in the last several weeks. I put the chickens inside this afternoon because it is just pouring rain. They loved the greens I gave them for a snack! I love having fresh eggs right, especially considering the girls will be 6 years old this next month! Chicks are selling out locally and I'm hoping to get some next month, as I'm sure our local hatchery is trying to keep up. Time will tell, but I think more people are waking up to the REAL idea of FOOD SECURITY. Grow/produce whatever you can. NOW. I might buy some pullets that are 3 months old into the summer, as a last resort. RESILIENCY is showing up, a local cafe turned themselves into a grocery store, since they have a different set of suppliers than regular grocery stores- Sunrise Cafe Shifts Business Model They'll be able to stay in business hopefully and help the community. Smart. A small local Organic nursery/store has opened up appointments for one person at a time to come in and shop alone. YES. Think outside the box. My work life right now is VERY dynamic. Last week we got new higher speed internet set up since our old internet was slow. My boss was planning on sending hardware home with me to start working remotely. We cleared off Dave's desk, that he only uses once in a while. I deep cleaned the room as well. Our main computer is in the kitchen and he has a laptop. Space all ready-Yesterday I was sent home, after working two hours, because our work load is drying up. While there is re-training going on among different staff I am basically in a high-risk group, which my employer is aware of. While I have a healthy immune system I do have respiratory issues and other things that put me into that category. Luckily I'm home (away from viruses) and I am being paid out of my own PTO and extended sick leave. When that runs out, if it gets to that place, the corporation I work for has stated they will be paying staff. Since I work for a huge medical organization at some point this will be over with and life will return to normal. In the meantime I am doing projects at home and taking things one day at a time. I saw this fun Permaculture art and I thought it some great ideas, as well as the one at the top and bottom of this post. Both are by Brenna Quinlan-Upcoming projects will be- tuning up our bikes, getting them usable to ride again. They've been gathering dust. Start doing Tai Chi again, daily when home, since class is over. My sweet instructor posted classes on Youtube to be able to follow his directions, with the warm ups. Deep cleaning areas of the house, starting to grow Micro Greens, backing up all my blog photos and more. A lot of the general Permaculture ideas tie right in with the Independence Days Challenges that I have posted for years. So I thought I would add this today!Independence Days Challenge-1. Plant Something- Cool weather crops, all Non GMO-  Salad Mix, Mammoth Spinach, Baby Romaine, Evergreen Bunching Green Onions. As soon as it dries a bit I've got seed for French Radishes, French Breakfast Radishes, Cherry Belle Radishes, Little Finger Carrots in the ground. We'll either start some summer things by seed, depending on the market, or use starts. Local nurseries are amping up production I think. It's been pretty chilly (25 at night this week) so things are starting pretty slow-If you think you can't grow food read this transformation 8 Weeks To Victory Veggie Patch From Scratch In A Rental photo below-2.

Manage Reserves- Get a Good Deal/Barter/Stock Up/Prep- I've been doing more creative shopping as some supplies have been running out off and on. When I heard some of the Corona virus news, I bought extra WW pastry flour and veggie seeds as I knew they would fly out of the store. Some staples like sugar are low some of the time. Flour has been in short supply. I've been alternating between some different places and sharing the info with our three adult girls. Luckily we got TP at Costco right before it started running out! One of them is getting set to start growing more food as well. I'm so proud of her! We miss our family, as we are not getting together in person, not worth the risk. We send videos back and forth, a little digital hug.5. Eat the Food- Try New Foods/Recipe-  Looking more at eating what we have and what's available. New cookie recipe, oh yes! Chocolate Biscuits I was looking for something not too sweet and good for tea and coffee. Simple ingredients. I'll make a quick soup for tonight with something I had on hand-Will add veggies and make some Farmgirl Fare Cheddar Beer Bread to go with it. Good for a cold rainy day! I use WW pastry flour and add more herbs.I bought a new cookbook for $3.00, free shipping, on eBay- 6. Build Community Food Systems- Sharing ideas with our kids. If I can get more chicks I may start  selling eggs again, time will tell. No farmers markets open, not sure if that will change. Atleast I have my farmer's market print-7. Recycle/Re-Use-  Yes, especially now.  I've had to buy some new things, but got some new sheets on Overstock.com, good prices.  I was down to my last set. No more driving around town for deals. I bought Dave and I new sneakers on Amazon, free shipping. We don't belong to Prime, since I already have plenty of streaming and don't like to pay for a membership. Shipping is usually free anyway if the order is over a certain amount.  Why join? I took our bedroom metal cart and moved it into the living room for storage and set up a charging station. Now I've added gloves, sanitizer and hand wipe clothes to it, for easy access-8. Skill Up- Learned all about different versions of high speed internet! Learning about simple French cooking.9. Regenerate What is Lost/Salvage Something- Tore out non-productive garden area of old raspberries. Will plant some cool weather veggies, buy new berries plants (if we can find some). Brennaquinlan.com"},

Given the state of the world I decided to plant some spring, cool weather crops. Here's the seeds I bought this weekend, all non GMO-With 30's in the forecast at night, we tucked everything under a new row cover. I tucked in the 2 lettuces before the birds ate them!Being resilient and adaptable we decided to tear out our low production/old Raspberries row and our one Marion berry plant along the low fence- I let the hens out and they had a blast digging in the bed!The ground was soft after the rain so Dave ripped them all out for composting with the city. We will plant something else in the space, possibly things like carrots and radishes. We will probably reconfigure more rows going south/north and plant more new berries. The East/West rows didn't do as well as the one North/South Blackberries we kept. Haven't decided what kind of berries to plant yet. It's always good to look at what works and what doesn't! We love having a supply of berries that can be eaten fresh or that we can freeze.Bedroom Closet Remodel-Originally when we moved into the house 13 years ago we added these wire racks to all the bedroom closets-They were good for clothes and shoes, but not all the other things I needed to store eventually after the kids moved out-Stuff partially pulled outI had the thought to tear the wire rack out, add 2 rods for Dave and my off-season clothes and crafts/decor stuff. I helped him measure and came up with this-Tape's a great way to mark things!Dave bought the rods, brackets, nails and 3/4\" particle board. All of this was about $35.00. I made the management decision to not paint the closet knowing the walls wouldn't show much anyway. I had bigger fish to fry. Here's how it went, took everything out first, then taped-  My nice metal cart went to use in the living room for a charging station & storageNext Dave started adding the supports, adding 1\" x 4\" furring strips-Next adding the shelves-Adding the rods, upper for Dave, lower for me, as he's taller! All done!Anya had to inspect, of course!I hung up the clothes, sorted and filled the shelves!Bedding on the top-Extra decor-Craft supplies-Fabrics and wrapping papers/bags-It took about 4 hours and was well worth it, and I got my bedroom back!Working From Home-I was surprised when my boss texted me out of the blue this weekend asking if I had wireless in our house (we do). First thing Monday morning I got an email that I would be set up work from home \"temporarily\", along with some other staff. They'll provide the hardware.  I suspect this will be ongoing for quite some time. I'd actually love to work from home to avoid the Corona bug, be able to open windows, get some fresh air, not have to listen to overly chatty co-workers. People sometimes don't realize how loud they can be! And kitty Anya can keep me company. I'll save money commuting, less wear and tear on the car, sitting in traffic, contributing to air pollution. Our work load has slowed down considerably, so I won't have to drive to work and potentially turn around and go home a bit later. All in all not a bad move for me. I'll move my PC from the kitchen to another part of the house and work there. More coming soon!From Allthingsgreen.nu/Northern Heart's 5 Best Ways To Handle Coronavirus Anxiety, Isolation & Stay Positive-I stumbled onto Maria from Northern Heart on Youtube a few months ago. I loved her videos! She's an incredible photographer and person. She's lives in a remote Swedish village, is fluent in English, and brutally honest about her life and is very inspiring to me. She has a lot of chronic health issues, many documented in her videos. I love this new video, watch and get to know Maria!!!The author of the poem, \"And The People Stayed Home\", Kitty O'Meara is profiled here, she is an ex-chaplain Kitty O'Meara Interview  And just look around for something to wonder at-From Gratefulness.org"},
{"title": "Spring Is Here & So Is The Corona Virus, Irish Soda Bread With Currants ", "date": "Mar 16, 2020", "text": "Spring Is Here & So Is The Corona Virus-We've been having really nice mild weather, then this weekend we had some heavy rain which we needed. New snow on the foothills which is good for fire protection later. Little green shoots and flowers are coming up all over the garden in the front and back yards! The hens are still laying which is so wonderful, having FRESH organic eggs! I made whole grain pasta, poached eggs, steamed asparagus with Parmesan cheese, for dinner Saturday, oh so good!So now we have five cases of the corona virus in Idaho, that we know of. The first person traveled to New York and then realized she was infected, bringing it into Idaho. She was smart, she went and got tested as soon as she had symptoms and is now self isolating. Don't know much about the other cases.  Almost all of the school districts closed school yesterday thru the state, for the next 2 weeks. That would be til the end of Spring break. That left parents high and dry for child care since they need to go to work. My employer has lots of patients calling in, panicking. There's been a lot of panic buying in Idaho which I shake my head at. We have a full 55 gallon rain barrel and a filter if we needed to filter it for drinking or washing. We also have bottled water stored. That's just part of our normal mode. We also have food stored and lots of toilet paper! It's really funny that people are panicking about not being able to buy toilet people paper, because so many places are out. Find a box of tissue people and cut it up (not for septic tanks). It's funny to me that there's no run on cold remedies and cough syrup? I mean if you're sick for 14 days and can't go out, wouldn't you want some on hand? We bought some groceries yesterday, and interestingly enough they were sold out of bananas and potatoes. Why?The Press isn't really talking about anything about keeping your immune system healthy. That would be boring news. Vitamin D3 is really great to take to keep your immune system healthy. Do all the other normal things to keep yourself healthy, so that you will be less likely to become infected. This is always a good reminder to be prepared for the unexpected. I have some long-term food storage as well as short-term, we have a freezer, our hens are laying and I am planning on getting three more chicks in a few months. We have three fruit trees and perennial beds that are edible. We have home canned goods and we'll be planting our summer garden soon. I always keep homeopathic remedies and essential oils hand for colds, cough and the flu. Ironically, ahead of the Corona virus, I had a terrible stomach flu bug early last week.  I had terrible vomiting twice in one day and no energy. I told my husband he didn't need to take care of me and stay home, so I just drank the fluids that I could and slept. Hubby brought me home some ready to eat Jello on his lunch break, a life saver!The good thing was we had all kinds of  OTC remedies on hand that I actually didn't need to take. I stayed home for two days and rested. To me this is just a real wake-up call, hopefully, for people to in general be more prepared. The Red Cross for years who said that everybody should have several days worth of food and water on hand. I heard a co-worker say his relatives back east were out of food. Since they lived 4 blocks from their grocery store they always shopped there. Now the store is empty, and they'll drive way north to buy supplies. Most people just don't listen. RESILIENCY to me is a really good thing in this kind of a situation. Be flexible, think outside the box, do something nice out in the Spring weather that doesn't involve being around other people. Sunday, when other people were panicking about the Corona virus, I made some Irish food! Go bake my friends!!!Irish Soda Bread With Currants-In early celebration of St. Patrick's Day I made Ina Garten's Irish Soda Bread. It came out great, moist, a little subtle orange and the currants were a nice addition-I served it warm with corned beef, baby Yukon golds taters and carrots. Fabulous! Happy St. Patrick's Day!"},

We had two days with near record high in the upper 60s and yesterday we got a good rain which we needed. Temperatures have dropped back down into the low 50's in the day and 30's at night. Lots of things are coming up in the garden front and back-Tulips and Asian PoppiesCrocusI haven't been posting much lately because I've had a really chronic shoulder problem with my right trapezius. It was so inflamed and painful that it was really wearing me out. I was really lucky that I was able to do acupuncture which helped a lot. Since my insurance didn't cover it I used a local acupuncture Co-op that has sliding fee scales. They're also open 7 days a week, just really helpful when you work weekdays So between that and Chiropractic I am about 90% good at this juncture. I've been doing heat/ ice, stretching, Arnica Gel, natural anti-inflammatories as well, so I did a multicultural approach so to speak. I have this happen a year or two ago and I think it's a little bit of overuse from doing so much keyboarding at work but that's a guess. Good news is, I'm on the mend. Then last weekend I god a cough and sore throat, not a good combo, just really wore me out. Cough cold almost gone, just lower energy still. Did my usual Homeopathic remedies, essential oils and stayed home Wednesday from work and rested. It all helped. Restoring Antique Framed Family Photos-When we went to Portland in December for my husband Dave's annual family Christmas party he was able to bring home a couple of framed sets of photos of his father Tony. The frames were really old and the wood was dried out. Some of the pictures were askew and just needed some TLC. I basically took everything apart and here's what I did-Flaws in the original placementWood dried and beat upI slid the back off both and re-taped with some Scotch Create Acid Free Tape, costs $4.00-Also found some good info buried under the backing- who was in the photo-I used dark Old English wood oil and really coated both frames. Let dry and polished.I washed the glass and put back together, looks much better! Hanging in our front hall instead of in a box somewhere...Rehabbing Ikea Trash-A few months ago I bought a few Ikea items online and had them shipped to the house. They're shipping is only $5 when you buy certain items so I was pretty excited at the great deals I got. One of the things I bought with it was a really large vase and it arrived in PIECES. Not only was I shocked that Ikea did such a poor packing job, but the fact that the box was mostly empty, didn't have a lot of packing left me scratching my head. I did send an email for a refund along with photos of the box with all the pieces of the vase inside. They gave me a full refund pretty quickly.  I decided not to re-order since I was afraid the whole thing would happen all over again. I started thinking that there was actually several very clean breaks in the stoneware and that maybe I could glue it back together. My thought was even if it look pretty rough most of the way around I could use it outside on my deck. I could fill with Ivy or something that would camouflage it. So last week I went ahead and glued it all back together. I think it actually came up pretty good! I found this glue that worked great-I started with the front then did the back, then the handle-BackFront, not bad!!!The Laying Has Commenced!!!I was really shocked this week when I went out to close up the coop for the evening and found tTWo EGGS! Sadly around the time that two of our hens were killed, by what appeared to be a random local dog, the other two also stop playing. That was probably back in about October. So we have had ZERO eggs since then. Since both of our hens will be 6 years old in a few months I figured they were probably just done. But no!!! This week I had two eggs the first night, two eggs the next night and one egg yesterday. Bless their little feathery hearts, they are back into their laying mode. I assume some of it' the longer, warmer days. It is really nice and I told them how much I appreciate them. I'm planning on getting two or three new pullets (female baby chicks) in late spring/ early summer. We buy ours from a local hatchery a few days old and it always depends on what their supply is. When we first started keeping chickens I made the mistake of buying chicks on spring break which was a huge mistake. They need to be kept inside where it's warm until they feather out and that is always a mess. Not too bad for just a couple of chicks though. So the great news is we do have some fresh eggs again and I am SO grateful. I knew my girls were worth keeping even though I are thought they were retired. Who knew that they were not retired yet? They say that chickens are born with all the eggs they will ever lay and once they're done they're done so apparently mine are not HAHA!"},

Yesterday the local weather people said it was the 4th warmest winter on record. It felt like it. Today I put away the last of the Valentine's decor and put out some of my other things I'd stored from winter-Put a new primrose in my vintage Swedish coffee potKitchen window BookcaseNeighbor Posey cat Coffee table, homemade topiarySide table living roomHappy, Scrappy & Resilient-Wow, it was 57 degrees today! Feels like spring. Yesterday the local weather people said it was the 4th warmest winter on record. I heard the phrase happy, scrappy and resilient the other day and for some reason it really resonated with me. I started thinking about if I was basically a happy person or not. Have a fairly happy life and the answer is yes. I think there are some people who choose to relive the drama in their lives over and over or create new drama. Then I think there are people who have drama in their lives and are able to pull themselves out of those situations and move forward in a positive way. Some don't. I've been there.I looked up the definition of scrappy because I'd heard a few different things. One is disorganized untidy and incomplete. The other definition is determined, argumentative or pugnacious. I'd like to think our house and property is not disorganized. I do think that we are determined and not real likely to listen to limitations on what we can do here. I hear people all the time talk about how they don't have time to do gardening, or grow food, or learn how to preserve it. Instead they're parked in front of their computers all day, all night gaming, shopping and doing unimportant things. You just have to set up a PLAN, think about how you want to do it, how much you want to spend and how to maintain it.I've been reading a lot about resilience last few years. Urban homesteading definitely needs to incorporate the idea of resiliency. For instance there are crops that we've tried to grow here that haven't done very well. After a while we eliminated them. The things that do grow well we can grow quite a bit of. If you have a really big surplus that kind of begs the question- is that the right path as well? We're going to try some straw bale gardening this summer in a very hot area to see how that goes. There's lots of information online, more coming later.Jamie Oliver's Garlic Mushroom Pasta-I saw this channel surfing on PBS last week and tried it. Jamie Oliver has a lot of 5 ingredient meals that are great! The pasta Jamie Oliver used in this recipe is much smaller, and slimmer, called Trofie. I have never seen that before. I used the Fusilli (Rotini) instead. Next time I would go to a specialty market to get mixed mushrooms. This time I stuck with one type. Nice recipe and FAST! Jamie Oliver Mushroom Garlic PastaSt. Patrick's Day decorations Thrifting Scores-I had some donations to make recently and so I went to to thrift stores. The first thing I scored was a really cute set of four brand new little wooden cars, $4.00 great for my two grandsons to play with!Next I scored a collapsible tote which I thought would be perfect for some of our road trips and possibly some summer picnics down at a local park now that our two grandsons are getting a little bit bigger. It's amazing to think that our grandson River will be for in May!From Happy Camper Folding Travel BasketA non thrifting score with a cute little pom pom banner from Cost Plus World Market for a couple of bucks-Is it Spring where you are????"},

Two days later, it was 57 degrees! Today the sun is shining, breezy and it is about 45 degrees. The grass is starting to green up just a little bit and I've noticed some shoots on my Oriental Poppy bush-BulbsLamb's EarAfter my tummy bug I was thrilled to find some sheep's milk yogurt. Technically I'm allergic to dairy cow products, and was told to avoid goat's milk cheese. I can eat Sheep's milk cheese with no problems though. I tried this, has tons of probiotics and pretty tangy! I've been really tired lately with working too much overtime, especially on Saturdays, but it was good to have the money coming in since we had a big car repair. My super reliable Mazda needed a new belt and tension rod. All fixed. I'm not working next weekend, I'm going to have two full days off!This Spring weather is way too early, but there's nothing we can do about it. Since we can get hard freezes in April sometimes I hope that if it's going to be mild, that it's going to stay mild! Forecast next week in 20's at night, mid 40's during the day, still cold. It's so nice to have the windows open a bit for some fresh air, hear the birds singing and see the sun. The sparrows are out fighting over our bird houses, so good thing Dave is building more! I'm making gardening plans since summer isn't that far off.... I do have some winter indoor flowers hanging in there-Last Amaryllis from the bulb \"garden\" from Trader Joe'sCream colored Poinsettia, also from Trader Joe'sSpeaking of gardening-Yes!Italian Mountain Bean Soup-I was channel surfing last night and stumbled onto this recipe on the Ciao Italia show on PBS. Fascinating combo of ingredients and fast to cook! I loved the idea of having thin, dried smoke ham in the soup (you could use prosciutto). I was lucky to find some today, from a local high end meat and cheese company. You add beans, veggie broth, potatoes, rinsed sauerkraut, onions for thick hearty soup. The recipe calls for cranberry beans, which I saw a long time ago in a local store, but didn't have any on hand. We went to the grocery store today and I found something called European Soldier beans, an heirloom variety that was canned. I had planned on buying small kidney beans, but bought these instead since I think they're closer to the what the original recipe calls for. I was actually really lucky spotting them and they were on SALE. So instead of using dried soaked beans I used the canned ones, rinsed well. At some point I will see if I can find some dried ones. Here's the recipe! Italian Mountain Bean Soup Yoda  I used fresh sage and dried thyme, bay leaf and rosemary and added to the broth, didn't use a bundle. The flavor was different and we both loved it! I served with hot whole grain Italian bread. Dave, who doesn't like sauerkraut, loved it even though it was in there. I rinsed it a LOT and squeezed out until pretty dry. If you go to the link there's a short video showing how to make it. It's a keeper!!!Bird Houses Project-Dave really enjoys doing woodworking and sadly we don't have room for a wood shop for him. I encouraged him to build some bird houses since a few of ours have gotten pretty bad and had to be pitched. One was full of a yellow jackets nest and I'd heard once there's that smell they will keep coming back. Off to the trash it went, after we sprayed it. I really like adding birdhouses for our local birds to our garden growing space. I LOVE birds! Since we had lots of scrap lumber on hand Dave did a lot of research, then came up with some plans. He came up with some really cute designs he found online. These are all demo projects that need to be finished. They will be for our yard, made from mostly recycled items/wood we had. He might make some for sale locally, we will see how time goes. Here's one I will paint white and add some trim-For smaller renters, license plate roof, needs the hole and a perch-I bought a vintage funnel off eBay for this, needs chain, and a stopper on top-Cleaning From The Top Down-Sometimes roaming around your house you notice all kinds of little things. Recently I noticed how dusty a lot of my frames were on my wall art. I always dust my furniture and vacuum, but it's easy to miss those other little things. I started thinking I really needed to start at the TOP of the walls and work down, as far as dusting. I had a brilliant idea that David I could tag team this. I gave him a long handle Swiffer and I took the short handled one. These kits are available in Costco, so cheap and work great! They're slightly sticky and don't spread the dust. He started along the ceiling and the corners of each room making its way across the house. He also went down about a foot below the ceiling corners. Then I came along, did the tops of all the framed prints, wall art, light fixtures, etc. This way is all the dust falls down and you come back and I suck it all up with your vacuum! Everything is clean, tidy and you let gravity do some of the work.  If you have allergies and respiratory issues (like we do) it's really helpful. I also cleaned the outer filter of my HEPA living room filter, all dusty and covered with cat fur. All clean now! We breathed a clean sigh of relief...."},

The forecast is for the 50's this next week, with 57 by Saturday!!! Too warm, too soon. I saw some shoots coming up in the front yard as well. Hopefully this is temporary, otherwise bodes badly for fire season. We'll out away our winter decor next week, no snow on the horizon! Bye bye snowmen and pine cones...Independence Days Challenge-Here's what we've been up to....1. Plant Something- Too early for out in the garden, but the flowers are doing great! They just keep blooming! 2. Harvest Something- Nope. I miss having our own eggs, we'll get chicks in the spring... 3. Preserve/Store Something- Got some great local artisan loaves of bread, froze them.4. Manage Reserves- Get a GoodDeal/Barter/Stock Up/Prep- Stocked up on supplements at Costco. Got my headlights re-coated at the dealer, bright again and much cheaper than new lamp covers. 5. Eat the Food- Try NewFoods/Recipe- We've been working on our amazing home canned organic peaches! They are so good! I made this recipe a few years ago, usually for the holidays, also great for a rainy day. I used whole wheat pastry flour for a little healthier version Cranberry Cornmeal Torte -I hadn't made an Italian meatloaf in a while either so tried this new recipe Delicious Italian Meatloaf I added more seasoning, extra garlic, etc. Recipe seemed too bland to me, came out great after I tweaked it! Served with homemade pesto on whole grain Italian bread, pesto potatoes and green salad-Made a homemade Chinese New Year dinner, Orange Chicken (Trader Joe's) fresh pea pods, Kim Chee, noodles with sesame. Add a big pot of Jasmine Green tea, perfect-Used my new Ikea tea cups, love the patterns and four for $10.00!For a quick dessert- Tart lemon sticky pudding with a little cream from a local health food store, microwave (shudder the thought) for 1 minute and all done. Don't hate me, I was too busy to bake!6. Build Community Food Systems- Not right now.7. Recycle/Re-Use- A few years ago a I bought the sweater below on eBay. It's an Eddie Bauer Legends vintage wool sweater. They made them for both men and women in wool, with gorgeous classic designs. I always get compliments when I wear it!  Last week I found another on eBay! Only $12.00 and gorgeous basket weave. A little too big, but that's okay. It was a little stinky when it arrived, so for $4.00 I took it to the dry cleaners, all better. Great sweaters, if you want to love the Legends, eBay does have them off and on.Also from eBay, a Columbia purse, $8.00, to replace my old one I've had for years. They have a pretty water proof lining, great for rain and snow days. Not too big, washable. From Goodwill, $4.00, large metal basket lined with moss, flowers, perfect for Spring! I really like the flowers color combo-I also got a like-new Puma long sleeve light base layer top for under the wool sweaters, new kitty toy and food bowl for Anya.Dave got a free, heavy steel bookcase when his boss was purging old stuff out of their office. Great fit for the bedroom with Grand kids toys. When the weather warms up I will take outside and give it a fresh coat of paint. Works great otherwise! He also got a 4 drawer steel file cabinet. We'll probably use it for small paint storage in the garage.8. Skill Up-I'm really excited to have started beginning Tai Chi classes thru our local Parks and Rec Dept. I took two classes so far and it great. It's really affordable thru Parks and Rec. Stretches, strengthens, improves balance and it's so relaxing! I go twice a week after work, and can see sticking with this long term. The instructor does Intermediate classes and beyond, we will see how it goes. Dave learning how to make some new styles of birdhouses with recycled materials. Photos coming soon.  9. Regenerate What is Lost/Salvage Something-Will re-paint my snow man before I put him away from winter. It's taken a beating, was thrifted, and I will keep it looking good!"},

That is one of the advantages of working for a large corporation!I had a really great year as far as my health, not needing any surgery, or major dental work, for a change! Between having had multiple foot surgeries for bone spurs, gold crowns falling out, two thumb surgeries, a few other odds and ends,  I was ready for a break.We've continued working on growing more of our own foods and preserving them. Got a great harvest from our peach tree, apple tree and a small pear tree. Rhubarb galore from our neighbor, bless her.Sadly we did lose two of our hens to a local dog from what we can tell. We will be adding some more chicks to the flock early this summer, and shored up our perimeter. More eggs by fall hopefully!We bought a new dishwasher which was awesome! Ours wasn't doing very well and was beyond repair and old. So we got our new made-in-America Bosch. Bosch brand used to be very expensive since they were made in Germany and shipped over, now they're made here. It's super quiet, got a great deal and does a great job!We had some really pretty snow in February right around Valentine's Day which was a nice treat!I continued on working and making different kinds of craft items, repainting things, and updating things sustainably, with thrifting, eBaying and generally frugally when possible.Got rid of more stuff via selling things on eBay, and lots of donations, bought some more thrifted items instead of new-In March Dave trimmed the Apple tree back by about a third, which was really helpful-We started our herb box in April and I bought a really nice lavender topiary. The topiary has wintered over successfully under for wraps four layers of row covers-In June we started moving toward a little bit more of a plant-based diet which has been somewhat hit and miss with the holidays. Started back up last with with Cuban black beans and brown rice!

We had our first ears of corn which was okay,  but not as juicy as I would have liked-Made new recipes, like stuffed Italian Marconi peppers- We went to our local Idaho State Historical Museum which has been totally remodeled a few years ago. They had great displays and this antique chicken pitcher was one of my favorites!In late September we rented a house on the Oregon coast and split it with her two girls families and Arthur daughters boyfriend. We had a great time and the weather wasn't too bad. To see a fun local Coastal museum-I made each of the girls a memory jar from the trip, as Christmas gifts! We brought home sand from the beach, seaweed, drift wood and shells-In October we totally redid our small master bathroom, after living here 12 years. It's really a half bath. It came out great with new flooring, Ikea cabinet/counter/sink, Ikea faucet, new toilet, new TP holder, new glass knobs for the lower cabinet, fresh paint and calm, coastal accessories. Gained floor space with a shallower cabinet footprint-Already had the Ikea medicine cabinet from the year beforeRe-used thrifted rack-November was pretty quiet and then we had a late Thanksgiving which morphed right into December and the winter holidays. It was busy but fun. November was when I also made my first two batches of homegrown Berry syrups-Went to McCall for our anniversary-Flew to Portland the weekend after Christmas, to see Dave's family at the annual Oliver Christmas party. Wished we'd stayed longer to see some of the sights, but had to go back to work! Mt. Hood from the airPhoto from Annabel Langbein Chocolate Cake websiteBelated Holiday Desserts-Sorry I didn't post these sooner! My two faves for the holidays, or whenever. The link above has the recipe for the  gluten free chocolate almond cake. The next one is for my British tea cake type dessert- Willamsburg Queen's cake, the currants and orange REALLY make this cake unusual. Keeps for over a week."},

I Finally Have Flowers, Dining Table Crate", "date": "Jan 12, 2020", "text": "Winter Wonderland!We woke up this morning to light snow falling and about an inch on the ground! So pretty! I thought by noon it would be all gone, but it was still snowing and at one point we had probably about 2\", maybe a little more. I got some nice photos before most of it melted this afternoon, but there is more on the way this next week. Happy dance! Here are some photos around the yard show how pretty it was, not in any particular order...My favorite shot!!!I Finally Have Flowers-I had quite the adventure this winter starting sometime before Thanksgiving. I was looking all over for a white or cream-colored amaryllis and could not find any. Instead of buying the red ones that were everywhere I kept looking and basically at Christmas I had no amaryllis. I had a wild idea to try Trader Joe's New Year's Eve night and found this great Amaryllis Garden for $15. It had three giant amaryllis bulbs (unknown colors), as well as a beautiful little Ivy, surrounded by moss in a really nice little wooden crate. What a steal! I gave it a regular little watering and the two smaller ones bloomed a few days ago and the large main stock bloomed today. It smells heavenly in the dining room. I read up on how to keep amaryllis bulbs after they bloom and will do that and have them again next year! Thank you Trader Joe's, for the cream and white blooms!Staked them upDining Table Crate-I found this cute little dining room crate on LTD Commodities a while back, bought it for after the holidays and I love it! On the side it has great graphics and quote. I always use table runners and have some kind of a small tray or basket holding regularly used condiments. So is perfect for the space, just a little something to organize things. Love the metal, rusty corners and rope handles!!!Grandma's toothpick holder goes well with it too!"},

We had a little snow this morning and it melted later with more on the way. More snow on the horizon in a few days.Dave's Christmas gift to me, new prayer flags for the coop!Not much snow this year so far. We had a really nice Christmas Eve dinner here that we hosted for all of our family and that was great. I made a hearty marinara sauce with sausage, green salad, Italian bread, I made Annabel Langbein, The Free Range Cook's, amazing chocolate almond cake and Panettone bread (Trader Joe's). I made each of the girls a gift of a beach memory jar. We took a family trip n September to the Oregon coast and shared a rental home. I took a bucket and brought back sand, driftwood, seaweed and seashells-I used canning jars, add sand, then the rest and added some tumbled back glass I had. I think they came out really nice! I'll be making one for Dave and I when I catch my breath!The weekend after Christmas we flew to Portland, Oregon where my husband's family is for their annual Christmas party, a couple of nice shots from 30,000 feet-Pink hole in the clouds, really unusualLiving out of state has its disadvantages as most of his family is not able to travel this far. We had a great flight, had a fun dinner Saturday night. We wanted to bring back Chewy, a 6 month old lab-He was such a love bug! Kisses for Dave-Sunday morning we squeezed in a short trip to Ikea, for some small things we could fly back. We found some great photo frames, a small reading light for Dave and a few other things. Dave found some old framed photos of his Father that we will repair, rehab and hang up in our house. All in all a fun trip, then flew back Sunday night. We did have New Year's Day off and it was great since we had most of the day with River our older grandson. He's 3 1/2 and just a hoot! Smart, funny and very entertaining. Then a short work week, then a very busy weekend this weekend. I deep cleaned most of the kitchen, we gathered donations and are planning a spare bedroom closet makeover ( more later). Back to work tomorrow so I can rest!    Healthier Banana Bread-I used this base recipe The Best Banana Nut Bread. I subbed Whole Wheat pastry flour, 3/4 brown sugar, 1/4 white and skipped the honey for a healthier version of banana bread. I did use butter, but you could swap that. I was happy it came out moist, not too sweet and light! Crunch on the top from the extra walnuts was a nice addition. Previously I just put them in the batter. Great in the winter with a hot beverage!Sirloin Tip Roast-I found a nice little roast on sale and decided to try this cut. I used this recipe Sirloin Tip Roast with some changes. I didn't salt the day before, so I added 1 1/2 Tsp salt to the herb mix. I also roasted at 300 degrees, instead of 250. I started with one hour and then checked the internal temp. At 140 degrees I took it out and let it rest. It was a bit more rare than I wanted, next time I'd go to 150 degrees. BUT it was juicy and tons of flavor! Great mix of herbs with the garlic. Roasting was about 2 hours or so. Leftovers will be for some Italian Beef and Roasted Vegetable Sandwiches."},

I like to start with winter decor, then add Christmas decor. Later I'll put away Christmas goodies and leave out winter thru January. Nice to bring nature inside! I love snowmen and greenery!!!1. Plant Something-Nope, it's winter.2. Harvest Something-I harvested the last of the Italian parsley, oregano, thyme, and hopefully the Rosemary will survive the winter. No eggs right now, I think our older hens may be done. New chicks next spring!3. Preserve/Store Something-I made 2 batches of berry syrups, Service Berry and Choke Cherry, more detailed information below. Nice to have a full freezer, lots of produce from the garden is there and ready to use.4. Manage Reserves- Get a GoodDeal/Barter/Stock Up/Prep-I got a great deal on a 22-pound turkey for Thanksgiving, made a big pot of turkey noodle soup after that large meal-We stocked up on batteries from Costco and other basics. Had to look at a new computer as Windows 7 won't be supported after January for doing our banking and taxes. Got a great deal on a 17\" HP laptop with Win 10, Office and Norton after doing tons of research-                                                                     Info here - Staples.comDave and I will share and can plug it into both our PC setup as a hard drive.

Eat the Food- Try NewFoods/Recipe-I want to a new restaurant for my birthday last week that serve spicy Cajun and Southern Seafood called Hook and Reel. I had my first crawdads! Also had some snow crab legs which were delish. I had bought a big box of Ikea crispy oatmeal cookies with dark chocolate and also a box of the plain crispy oatmeal cookies in Sept. The choc/oatmeal were amazing!!! Then I found quite a few recipe on how to make them from scratch. I realized I had a whole big box of the plain crispy oatmeal cookies. What to do? Melt semi sweet chocolate and spread between the cookies, let cool and enjoy!6. Build Community Food Systems-Not doing that right now7. Recycle/Re-Use-I took a unused bathroom hand towels we had and transformed it into wash cloths. Sadly Ikea has discontinued my fave apple green bath towel color in the the last year or two. Since the rest of the set was doing ok, I just needed better washcloths. They are in really bad shape from the hard water. I used an old wash cloth for a model and sewed them up! Problem solved for free!!!Nice and new hand towelWash cloth rough and yuckyRough cut wash clothsTrimmed more square, hemmed and sewn!I hit a thrift store yesterday, got Dave a brand new insulated large lunch bag, a like-new blue and white reversible snowflake runner for the dining table, 4 jumbo white snowflakes for outside, a juice pitcher, and a like new Etcha Sketch for Grand kids, total $17.00!8. Skill Up-Learned quite a bit about my older Mazda. Started making an odd sound, son in law was able to diagnose, loose tension rod. Will get fixed this week, hopefully a low cost fix.  Super reliable cars! I was glad we spent $5.00 to join the online Consumerreports.org and do car research before buying. You can cancel the next month, after you buy your big ticket item.9. Regenerate What is Lost/SalvageSomething-Washed the winter quilt I bought at a thrift store last month.

Here's what I did:I put each batch in my enameled pot, barley covered with water, mashed the Service Berries, strained and brought to a simmer with sugar (recipes online).

I've never been a fan of traveling for the holidays since so many things can go wrong weather-wise.

More snow maybe later this week. Living in the Northwest I've seen it all from snow to very, very icy conditions. So we'll be home with family relaxing on Thanksgiving! Anya is ready for some turkey.

{"title": "Winter Is Here- Sort Of, Tweaking Bathroom Remodel Decor, Planning A Backyard /Coop Re-Do,Great Finds!", "date": "Nov 10, 2019", "text": "Winter Is Here, Sort Of-Our weather has been so dry, dry, dry lately that it's strange watching all the snow back East. It's been in the fifties lately during the day the thirties at night, so winter is definitely here. Our 14 degree cold snap last month really affected some of our trees locally. If you look at our huge maple tree, some of the leaves are just wilted, little color. Not normal! Other people noticed that some of their trees didn't really have a chance to change color as much as usual either. We still have all of our cold weather gear out. We're loving our new warm comforter I bought off season and kitty Anya is always finding a warm spot in the sun. We're waiting for a first big rain storm to arrive. Still allergy season sadly. We packing up the garden work bench today and I covered with plastic-Bye bye toolsLast night we had a taste of summer by opening our 1st can of our organic peaches I canned. Amazing in a light syrup, just like fresh!!! So good...... paradise peaches...Tweaking Bathroom Remodel Decor-We finished up the bathroom remodel and I did the reveal last week. I wanted to tweak a few things though, so here is more of an updated version! I moved a few things around on the rack above the toilet and moved the print down. I realized there was a really big gap between the top of the toilet and the wall rack, so problem fixed! I bought some new knobs at Hobby Lobby for the new Ikea cabinet, green/blue ceramic and a really nice shade, I was not a fan of the old, cheap black metal ones- I moved my wood fish I bought at the coast where I could see it better, driftwood-ish...I wanted some kind of a glass float to put in the bathroom. They're not hard to find but the ones that I found were really overpriced. I looked on eBay and I found these faux ones instead! Nice sized for a small bathroom-I think for now we're  all done!!!Planning A Backyard /Coop Re-Do-Recently I was reading an article about keeping small livestock and how much easier it is. I started thinking about the layout of our background, and the fact we will probably need to rebuild the coop soon. It's held up really well for quite a few years, but it's showing wear, wood rot in small areas. We know we need to put it on a different type of foundation. I started thinking we should build a new Coop/shed where are shade area and cold frame is-That would open up more sunny space for the garden for growing vegetables and would give the chickens a cooler area in the summer. It would also be away from the main easement fence, and less visible to hawks overhead. We'd reconfigure the chicken fencing as well. Dave's on board, and he's designing, and may do that next summer. It would be easy enough to build a second coop while the first one is still up. We'll probably build on some shed space, since we don't have a shed at this point. That would be a great use of space! And we could, of course, use a lot of recycled materials.Tea Cups, $10.00Great Finds !!!I do tons of thifting and eBaying for great deals. I only recently found out that Ikea has started shipping items across the U.S.! They have a $5 shipping fee up to a certain amount of weight, I'm not sure what. I did find some really cool items that I was going to order, but was really disappointed that you can't order any of their holiday items online. If you follow this blog you know that I really love Scandinavian holiday stuff! I was really excited to find some great things and I added them to my shopping basket. When I went to check out there was a big note of these are unorderable online,  bummer. I ordered a few random things, including a new shower mat. We had bought one when we were in Portland coming back from the coast fit perfect was heavy and was only $7. These are the more fun items that I was able to get online, all found at Ikea.Us12\" tray, $7.00 for next spring, was not in storeHuge Godtagbar vase, $10.00, goes with 2 other smaller ones I bought previously, love the lumpy handmade clay look, and traditional Swedish folk art designI discovered this website last year LTDcommodities (I'm not an affiliate).  I found a few fun items for winter and the holidays.

{"title": "DIY Bathroom Remodel Reveal!!!", "date": "Nov 4, 2019", "text": "DIY Bathroom Remodel Reveal!!!I'm happy to share with you our new master bathroom remodel! If you check my previous two posts you can see the process. The large bathroom is down the hall, the \"master\" is a powder room\" basically. We did the large bathroom five years ago, also with Ikea components. We did everything ourselves, except for the flooring and toilet install. We had the flooring guy do both, since there were multiple layers of vinyl and a larger flange for the toilet. It didn't cost that much, and it was worth it. We'd done our laminate plank flooring thru the house, not too hard. We paid cash, no financing done. I am really loving the wall color! A soothing blue/gray, and the overall vibe is very serene. It's basically all done except for some new knobs that I will be buying for the bathroom cabinet. This weekend Dave and I finished up a few odds and ends related to the remodel, and got everything moved back from around the house. Since there was a low minimum fee we also had him stretch the carpet in our two spare bedrooms. No more bumpy carpets! Soon I'll get them steam cleaned and then all done. I really deep cleaned the bedroom after raising all the dust. Saturday I spackled an area next to the bathroom cabinet that was still a little bit rough. A bit more tweaking, then painted the area. One of the things we discovered is at our new Ikea bathroom cabinet is about four or five inches shallower than our original one was. It has tons more storage and actually makes the bathroom look bigger, which is a double bonus! Bathroom before photos 2015 Mini-Bathroom-Makeover  Tons of storage in the drawers, paper liner included-Dave did have to adapt the plumbing a little bit since it came out of the side of the wall and also had to notch the drawer of the cabinet-HUGE bottom drawerDave also drilled a round hole in the side of the cabinet (VERY carefully) for the pipe-We had to do this on the other cabinet and I've seen on the internet that that's a pretty common thing. Luckily it doesn't affect the structural integrity. There's so much more drawer space, it's not even funny. I don't have to get down on my knees to find our supplements, etc. Ikea runs their plumbing laterally and then drops it down, versus American plumbing, which goes straight down.  Dave installed the new Ikea faucet  on the counter top before we lifted it into place. I love the curves on it, and so much more water pressure!I'm sure the old faucet had clogs in the aerator, even though we'd flushed it several times. For $39.00 it was a steal. We've had great luck with our other Ikea bathroom faucet. We caulked the counter to the cabinet, but only on the front, in case we need to pull it for plumbing repairs. Dave's idea, good to plan ahead. Sunday we hung up my new bird shelf. A few months ago, when we were thinking about doing this, I thought I'd like to get a shelf with birds. I actually found one, at Hobby Lobby. I needed something really shallow due the small space, it was a perfect fit and half price with a coupon! Sunday we hung everything up. Added a piece of driftwood, homegrown lavender, mini wreath and a mini prayer flag- Crab shell Dave found on the beach for me! I had also found this driftwood-inspired seashell plaque at Hobby Lobby, which I LOVE-Wood fish on the rod from the Oregon coast tripI was trying to bring in the look of driftwood since I'm going for a coastal motif. I put some other items up on top of my cabinet over the toilet. I reused the print, bought the lighthouse candle holder, and seahorse, also from Hobby Lobby. I'll hang some dried flowers on the rod soon, or maybe some fabric-Home grown lavender in Ikea vase I bought on the way back from coast trip-Ivy on adjacent wall-The other items I already had, my little hanging rack and clock back up by the sink area-Sunday I was able to find a small cotton rug at Ross, a discount store, for $4! I wanted something rounder since it's a square bathroom and I love the crochet edging, kind of vintage looking-We re-used the Ikea medicine cabinet which we bought last year, light fixture above the sink and the towel rod, no point replacing them- Re-used my old Ikea vase and flowers-We did buy a new Moen toilet paper holder,  the exact same one as the other bathroom. Much easier to load and very minimal looking-Cheap, black Ikea knobs will be replaced- All four will go-I put this ceramic one from Hobby Lobby on the medicine cabinet last year, I may try and find the same ones, or something else coastal vibe style-There's also the new toilet, which works great, and the trend now is chair height toilets which I wasn't aware of-According to at least one plumber it's because of the obesity level in the United States which is really pretty sad. The one really great thing about the toilet is that it flushes really well, there's a large tube inside and the entire tank empties really fast. We learned doing research that when your toilet gets old the smooth inside glaze part of the ceramic gets really rough. Solid waste tends to get trapped more. We also thought that since we have a little bit lower water pressure our toilet was clogging due to that. It was actually because the toilet was just getting older. So all in all we're really happy with it and it has a slow close lid as well!"},
{"title": "Bathroom Remodel Part Two, Record Cold-16 Degrees Tomorrow Morning!", "date": "Oct 29, 2019", "text": "Bathroom Remodel Part Two-I took a vacation yesterday to be home for the flooring installer. So far our bathroom remodel is going smoothly! After emptying everything out I went ahead and started on the prep for painting. There were some nail holes, a few little indentations but the primary work was for the area where the sheet rock have been damaged removing the back splash. When I installed the back splash I used construction adhesive, thinking  it would be a much longer before we remodeled. Prepping the damaged sheet rock I basically did two things, spackled to smooth everything out and then used a texturizing spray. I've done plenty of spackling and Dave had used the spray so I knew what to expect. I did the spackling, got things fairly smooth, let it dry I came back then sanded. I and did a little more sparkling in a few other areas as well. Here's the 1st spackling- Next the texturing spray applied, dries white-We used Homax Wall Texture spray, about $10.00, used 3/4 of the can-It's a great idea to warm up the can  of texturizing spray. The sounds kind of funny but it's actually on the directions. I put the can in a pitcher of very warm (not hot) water. I went outside and practiced on a piece of cardboard. I textured the sheet rock as best as I could to match. I had already decided to not worry about getting a perfect match on 45 year old sheet rock! One of my saving graces is that the IKEA cabinets are taller than American cabinets by a couple of inches. With the thick porcelain counter top / sink I didn't have to repair/match quite as much ,since some of it wouldn't show. I worked on starting to paint the bathroom while that dried. Here you can see the old, lighter blue and the new darker blue/grayThe ceiling was a dirty looking light brown (smoke stains?) all painted! I was going to do the ceiling in a bright white, but decided to go for simple, one color! It's Ace Hardware's Bouyant Blue-With our LED lighting in the bathroom, and no window, it may look different in my photos. I tried to color correct, but hard to match sometimes-I painted the ceiling first, then worked on the walls and a brush work. Since we were replacing the flooring you didn't have to worry about dripping on it,  I did put down a tarp to protect the carpeted area going into the bedroom-Next I painted the re-textured area to see how it would look. I still wasn't very happy with it ,but the good news is you can use it over paint. I textured again and let that dry. I  took a break to start some split pea soup with ham for dinner. It came out great and we had cheddar biscuits with it, yum on a cold night! After dinner I went back to check the area since it had dried and went ahead and did another coat of paint. It looks a lot better which I was happy with! Again I had decided to sort of live with whatever wasn't totally perfect. I know I'm a bit OCD, ha ha, and have a tendency to focus on one little tiny area on the wall. I must say I really love the wall color, a soft blue with gray which was a very hard color to find.After dinner we got the rack over the toilet, new white exhaust vent cover and medicine cabinet hung back up-I wanted to give the thrifted rack above a fresh coat of white paint but it was way too cold outside, maybe in the spring, it's easy to take down. We kept the light fixture since it was in great shape and I like it-The new vinyl plank flooring is called Rockport, as close to gray as we could get, wish it was a little lighter, but it works. It's grayer in natural light-Ikea cabinet is in place, Dave's finishing the plumbing hook up-New toilet!Currently our house really looks like a bomb went off since we had to move a lot of the furniture out of our two spare bedrooms to get the carpet re-stretched while our flooring guy was here. We basically had to empty the bedrooms as much as possible. There a lot of places that charge an arm and a leg to do that, but since we already had him working on a job here he didn't charge us very much. I love working with small local businesses since their customer service is so much better!Watch for the full bathroom reveal this weekend!!!From Accuweather.comRecord Cold-16 Degrees Tomorrow Morning!It was 23 degrees yesterday morning, with a high of 31, so cold and gray! Today was 30 when I got off work. Tomorrow morning the forecast is 16 degrees, a possible record cold. This is WAY too early! We haven't drained our pond yet, so that will be fun. We brought in our pumpkin and Mum off the front porch so they wouldn't freeze solid. Anya is laying in front of the kitchen heater next to me, and the heat's on in the coop. Luckily my hens Ellie and Rosie are almost done molting! I hope this isn't a sign of things to come! We're ready, glad I bought the extra heavy comforter!"},

I've plugged in the chicken waterer after Dave dragged out our extra heavy duty cord. We have a porch light, reptile ceramic disc heater and infared heater bulb hard wired in. Since both hens are molting I'll turn it on tonight. They have lots of food and had treats today. Our house is ready, cars too. Bye bye summer blouses for work! I got out our hats and gloves last weekend knowing this was coming. I think with our cooler summer we may be in for a brutally cold winter. I hope I'm wrong, but time will tell. I do like a LITTLE snow, but hoping there's not too much. Don't want a repeat of Boise 2016's Snowmageddon! Lasted for months and poor Dave just kept shoveling-So pretty though!"},

I wanted just gray, but not easy to find apparently. Vinyl sheet flooring seemed to have gone away since our first remodel. We ordered a nice sheet flooring design but it got put on back order, and decided to go for good timing/same price. I can live with it. I'm going for a relaxed coastal vibe, not beachy. I'm re-using the light fixture, towel rod and small rack. Walls will be a soft nice blue/gray, Ace's Buoyant Blue, more gray in real lighting, a bit darker/grayer than the current shade-We bought the new Ikea cabinet-with this sink/counter, same as our other bathroom, I wanted a rectangular but Ikea was out of stock-and a new Ikea faucet-Lillsvan FaucetI found a few fun accessories at Hobby Lobby last weekend. I'll take lots of photos during the process. Saturday Dave and I are ripping out the old cabinet and clearing the walls. Sunday I will paint. Monday flooring guy is coming, will add new floor and new toilet. He's also stretching some carpeting in our 2 spare bedrooms. Then I can get them cleaned! Later in the week Dave and I will finish up. More coming soon!!!The last twoThe Ugly Side of Urban Life With Chickens-I had to think about whether I really wanted to post this or not because I was so upset. Even Dave  was upset and he's not a big fan of the chickens. A few days after coming home, with Annie gone, Dave came home and found Sarah, our beautiful big red hen dead as well-When I came home I couldn't find Dave and I was wondering where he was. When I saw him on the back deck with a terrible look on his face I knew something awful had happened. From what we could tell a dog got under our back fence (on an easement) where some of the boards were rotting, got into the coop and killed Sarah.Her carcass was outside in the garden and when I took a good look at her she had been eviscerated. It looked like she was cornered in the coop. I was so shocked I didn't even know how to feel. Dave and I both blame ourselves that we should have kept the fence more intact, but I guess after 5 years you start feeling like things won't go wrong. We're not sure now if dog also killed Annie?I kept the last two chickens in the coop the next day, since the weather was cool and let them out in the evening so that they could stretch their legs. Dave bought some lumber and basically removed all of the cedar fence boards that had rotting bases. He then back filled along the fence line on the outside in the easement. He showed me the hole where the dog had dug down. It wasn't that big but it was big enough for medium/ small size dog to kill a hen. Ironically the two chickens that were killed were both the young ones or some place supposed to replace the old ones! So now our flock went from 4 to 2 and I'll think about if we want to get a few more chicks in the spring. I just never in my wildest nightmares thought a dog would break into my yard, kill one of my birds, a few days after a the other one. Shaking head..."},

Many people around the world already make their home cozy, year round. Many of these ideas can be incorporated with low cost or free items. Things like bringing in nature- leaves, branches, pine cones. Buy some books, snuggle up and read! A big one is staying in the moment, be present. Board games are making a comeback, put the phones away and have a fun round of Monopoly! Talk to each other. Bake something from scratch, have friends over for tea and cake.  Listen to music with no distractions. Hygge has lots of simple concepts, here's a Hyggekrog, or cosy corner, something soft, warm drink, candle and a book-From Curbly.com Scandinavian Lighting TricksBringing nature in is important, year round, too!

{"title": "The Second Hawk Attack Was The Last One", "date": "Oct 11, 2019", "text": "The Second Hawk Attack Was The Last One-I wrote about the first time Annie, my white hen, was attacked by a hawk here and survived Hawk Attack . The second time she wasn't so lucky. I looked out yesterday morning and saw a big blob of something white on the ground, thought it was a row cover that had blown off in the wind from my herb box. I put on my glasses and realized it was my hen. I went flying out of the house to find my poor honey almost decapitated and dead. I was so upset I didn't know quite what to do, since I had to go to work. I decided to simply remove her from the area and set her aside. She was a really sweet pea with a real curious personality. When I came home from work I had more of a chance to look at her, look at the scene and try to figure out what happened. I was pretty convinced it was a hawk attack and I still am. I found a little bit of blood on the top of both sides of the gate going into the garden-Her neck was broken so hopefully she died fast when the hawk struck. Her body was outside the gate in the big pile of feathers. One breast was completely removed and eaten. Looking back I think she may have been attacked around dusk the night before, but it's hard to tell it might have been early in the morning. She was out the day before after work, when I collected the eggs and gave them a snack. I looked up and read that hawks to attack really early in the morning/late in the day near dusk. Last night I decided to close the coop door and only let the other 3 out after there was more daylight in the sky. It's hard when you have a small flock to lose one after you have raised them from a 1 or 2 day-old chicks. You really get to know their personalities. So rest in peace Annie,  you survived one but unfortunately not the second one. So sad.... Annie"},

Plant Something-Wrong time of year for here. The weather changed so fast I didn't have time to plant bulbs, maybe next year.2. Harvest Something-Picked the small amount of baby pumpkins (not enough sun), eggs (about 1-2 per day), last of the basil. It's supposed to be 25 degrees Wednesday morning!Last week got the baby zucchinis, tomatoes, bell peppers, jalapenos, and Gypsy peppers. Dave put the garden to bed for the winter.  The hens love having more space!3. Preserve/Store Something-I made pesto (finally!) this weekend to freeze. In the next couple of weeks I'll thaw my Chokecherries and Service berries and make syrups. Today I made Rosie Daley's Pesto (Oprah's former chef) today, enough for 7 small jars to freeze. Great for pasta or smeared on a roasting chicken! I used Romano instead of Parmesan since that's what we had. The whole house smells great!4. Manage Reserves- Get a GoodDeal/Barter/Stock Up/Prep-Got a 1/2 price garage door tuneup, fixed some balance issues. I got some  new cord slacks at Eddie Bauer outlet a while back, for $10.00 with coupon, stored for winter, wearing them now!  Got new tires for my 11 year old Mazda, runs great, did research and got $150.00 off with a coupon compared to everyone else in town. Great traction!5. Eat the Food- Try NewFoods/Recipe-Tried this again, a bit high on the butter, but nice! Mary's Apple Cake  I didn't bother making it with rows of apples, just laid them out, sorry no pic.6. Build Community Food Systems-Not this year, never made it to the farmer's market. Not selling eggs at this point.7. Recycle/Re-Use- Donating some things to charity, will re-use existing items in upcoming bathroom re-do. Light fixture, towel bar, etc. Our corn stalks are out in front of the house, very Autumn-y! I bought some Twining's Extra Strong English Breakfast tea. Sadly they don't wrap them in individual foil pouches. After wracking my brain I found I had this almost empty glass container. I washed it, filled it, and printed a little label I made, glue stuck it on. On the counter ready for winter! I also re-used this tin to take the same tea to work in my drawer, as I drink tea every morning-(sorry blurry)Got a great deal on a comforter a few months back, stored it and got it out, since it's so cold. Got a fun little Hygge book on eBay for a couple bucks, just delivered-8. Skill Up-Dave and learned ALL about different kinds of toilets, since we need a new one. Once our flooring is here we'll buy one.9. Regenerate What is Lost/SalvageSomething-We will start, hopefully, our bath remodel in the next month, waiting on flooring to arrive. May have to change plans on that as it slowing the process. We have a couple of back up plans for the flooring if needed. We're going thru a locally owned shop, used them before, just a matter of get the inventory in. They do great work, more selections that big box stores, nice people.Autumn Fun Decor-This is the time of year ,especially with our recent really cold weather, that I like to bring some nature inside. Here's a look at some of our fun fall decor mostly thrifted!

Yes, SNOW! An early front is moving in and I'm ready, almost. We woke up to 44 degrees, and it's starting to rain. At 11:00 am it's 48, brrr. We're picking the rest of the veggies today, since the local temps in the 30's will pretty well be the end of the summer garden. We were lucky to have a fairly mild summer, so maybe this won't be a horrible winter? Time will tell.... Will be putting up Autumn decor this weekend, perfect timing! Winterizing the house is on. Here's a peak of Autumn fun to come-Hoot and Lil Hoot, prim fun from eBayThrifted, great colors!SunsetOregon Coast Trip-We were really excited to go to the Oregon coast on the 15th! Last year Dave and I looked at renting a house and including our three adult children, spouses and two grandchildren for a real family vacation. We have never done that before. We found a really good vacation rental by owner house in Rockaway Beach on the Oregon coast. It had a bedroom downstairs, 2 bedrooms upstairs and a hide-a-bed in the living room. Sleeps 11. Nice sized kitchen and I loved their woodstove! We decided not to use it since there were two young children in the house, also 60 to 65 degrees during the day, too warm. I looked up the model, it was from Denmark and probably extremely expensive, lovely soapstone as well-Dinner out first night-Fun wall decor on the upper wall-The weather was pretty mild, but pretty wet. The second full day there were sunny skies and dry! Gorgeous!!! We went to a sweet, little maritime museum in Garibaldi, 10 minutes south-My fave display, love the Coasties!!! They have a gorgeous historic station house in Garibaldi-From Coast Guard Station Tillamook BayCrab anyone?Native American wing-ScrimsawWent went to the Blue Heron French Dairy. We'd been there years ago. I was really disappointed, as it went from charming French-decor to a touristy kind if place. French decor gone, more pushing cheese and wine tastings. I guess you have to survive in the business world. We did score 2 jars of amazing Huckleberry jam though! We went to the beach, ate lots of fresh seafood, got to know all the fun little areas. We saved a lot of money by eating breakfast at the house and some dinners. With a house rental you have to bring everything food-wise including specific utensils. We did miss a chance to ride on the local steam engine, since their website listed that they only ran on Saturdays and Sundays. A fun time was had be all!Storm blowing inDrive back, lush, green and super saturated by the rain. We both came down with a sore throat the morning we drove back. Pretty sick for a week, cold and hacky cough. Did lots of Homeopathy, essential oils and rested when we could. Here's the drive back-Misty Oregon morning, driving eastEastern Oregon, hitting the BluesOur wonderful neighbor babysat our kitty Anya, collected the eggs, and the mail. I knew that she liked beachy things, so I bought her a nice little wind chime, and 2 of wooden beachy ornaments. She loved them! While we were at the farm style warehouse store in Garibaldi I also bought these two items for us-A nice little wooden fish that may go into our new bathroom remodel and a fun little entryway wooden item. I did collect some sand, seaweed and miscellaneous sea shells and Driftwood free fun crafts project later more to come on that.Ikea Trip/Bathroom Re-Do-We decided recently to remodel our small master bathroom. After crunching numbers and deciding which projects to move forward with we decided to do it. We did a lot of research and I finally found an Ikea bathroom cabinet that would fit the space, since it's an odd size. We had looked for years and couldn't find anything, but at some point Ikea came up with one that was perfect. It's free standing and basically the same make and model as the one in our other bathroom that is held up really really well. They're painted finishes are super tough. I wanted the rectangular basin above, but they were out, so I bought the one above that's oval. I can live with it. I did buy a new faucet at the IKEA store, but then we realized it would be a little bit too tall. IKEA cabinets are European measurements which basically mean they are taller substantially. I was able to do a return through the mail, and they are now shipping small items for $10.00 . I was able to buy a really nice faucet for the same price. Their faucets are really high quality based on our experience, reviews, they have lots of great selections and are so much cheaper. Here's the one I got in the mail a few days ago-Nice curves! Lillsvan We visited with our small locally-owned flooring store and couldn't find a white with blue/ gray floral. I did find some other vinyl that I really like-Mannington Filigree PewterWe had already added a new Ikea medicine cabinet last year since the old one was falling apart and we will get a new toilet. Luckily the sub flooring is intact unlike the other bathroom that had a rotted section. I'll do a fresh coat of paint, still choosing that. Think coastal, sea foam? We'll have new flooring, a new cabinet and toilet and then we'll be done! Will start the project to the few weeks after we have a chance to put the garden to bed and do some of the projects.At Ikea (fast trip on way home) I got a few specific things... 2 Fladis baskets, can fold down or have open, $9.99 each-They had a new set of vases based on old tradition Swedish forms, each looks handmade. Blue pitcher/vase with stripes, $5.99-Photos from IKEA Godtagbar VaseLarge 7\" high vase, gorgeous! $7.99-Love the tree idea!We had lunch there, then grabbed some dry foods, and Lingonberries/ juice to bring home. Glad we stopped! We picked up the cabinet and sink as well, the important part! Grabbed a few hand towels, shower mat, toilet scrubbers, and a new ergo pillow for me, only $14.99! Love that place...Stuffed Italian Peppers-I finally got a great crop of Giant Marconi Italian peppers! I always wanted to cook some in a traditional fashion. Since my peppers were large and very curved I made this recipe by splitting the peppers, frying, adding the stuffing on top and put in the oven at 400 degrees. I also used our own home grown organic tomatoes instead of sauce. Just chopped and squashed, juicy! Less stove top time and came out great! Stuffed Italian Frying Peppers   I made a 2nd batch, just baked everything for 40 minutes and used tomato sauce, also delish!First fryPut in baking dishMake stuffing"},

In the last two days we've had lots of wind, thunder, lightning and rain here in Boise. While the rain is a blessing, the winds and lightning can always start fires. October usually brings our first big storms. One thing I'd thought of recently was buying sheets of heavy plywood to cover our large, west-facing windows and sliding door if they got hit by a storm. These take the brunt of the wind, and branches come down quite frequently-Dining room sliderLiving room picture windowMaster bedroom windowTarps won't cut it in 65 + mph winds, snow or rain! It could also be used on the roof in case of a storm downing of large branches. We're in high summer garden and harvest season, but soon I'll be prepping the coop and putting the garden to bed for the winter. WINTER, yes it's coming.  One of the things I did today was buy a new winter comforter for master bedroom bed.  I realized I only had one comforter in the entire house and ours was getting pretty worn. If we lost the furnace or power it could get pretty darn cold with just one comforter, now two is even better! I got a great deal at a local discount store for that. I'll keep the old one as a spare. As for preparedness I have several links below with really great information on what kinds of things you may want to have on hand. There's also a link below about how to save money while prepping. Don't forget one of the main things you need to have on hand is WATER as you may not have access to some depending on the emergency you might have. Extra food, fuel, pet foods, baby/child items, OTC and prescription medications are always a must. We stock up on canned goods, batteries and I am storing more water this time of year. While we have a 55 gallon rain barrel it would need to be filtered (we have a filter),  but we have to empty it for the winter. I buy a gallon jug of water for $1.00, so it's easy to buy a few at a time. I personally don't like reusing milk jugs for water storage. Some folks use alternative methods for heat, wood stove (still want one) or have a generator. We have a camping stove and several Kerosene heaters, but not for indoor use. We could use the stove in the garage for cooking in a vented area. Links here - Ready.gov  Budget Friendly Preparedness Kit   Don't forget your pets!Home Fire Extinguisher Warning-We found out some information recently I thought I'd share, from my husband's business Fire Safety inspector. He told Dave that most home fire extinguishers have a six year life span. The plastic handle will also break a lot, as the solution will turn to sludge. If yours is 20 plus years old it might fail when you most need it. We bought a industrial version from for $55.00. Check yours, better safe than sorry! Any welding supply company has them and they'll recharge every six years for half the price. Here's our new one-Harvest Time Continues!It's the land of plenty! Nothing like freezing lots of famous San Marzano plum tomatoes, dead ripe!!! Little babies too-Lots of apples, froze about 15 gallons or more of apple slices for baking-Pears are starting, we bake or eat fresh, since it's a semi-dwarf tree-And then there's apple crumble-"},

The weather may have been a little tiny bit milder than usual, not a lot of weeks in the 100s.

This is one of those. It's really easy in the course of life to get caught up in the mundane things. Commuting to your job five days a week, doing laundry, cleaning the house, all the really boring parts of life the rest of the time. Then there's taking care of the chickens-and then the eggs!We also tend the garden and see what we can grow here at our little homestead. When we plant things in the spring and early summer there's always a lot of labor involved in that, then watering, fertilizing, weeding, etc. We have planted a ton of perennials as well, and lots of pollinator plants. Now we're getting into the full harvest season! I looked at our corn this weekend and was thrilled to see that some of it was ready to pick! I haven't tried growing any since we've lived here-Beans at the baseSweet cornSaturday night dinner, it was amazing!There's also: bell peppers, Jalapeno peppers, Gypsy peppers, Giant Italian Marconi peppers, pickling cukes, Lemon cukes, the five different kinds of tomatoes, Itchidai eggplants, kale, collard greens, green beans, Zucchini, two kinds of baby ornamental pumpkins, peaches, apples, pears, Basil, Thyme, Rosemary, Italian Parsley and the blackberries that keep on giving!Big, tall Basil, pesto time soon to freeze!Baby pumpkins by the beans-All homegrown cukes and tomatoes, more Saturday night dinnerGreen beans, bacon & onion, another Saturday night dinner dishIt's really amazing when I looked around this morning at exactly how much we have grown here on the small, urban lot. Dave started picking some peaches last weekend but we couldn't really process anything since we had two days of babysitting and it just didn't work. Luckily the Red Haven peaches weren't dead ripe yet, but they were this weekend-Dave picked all the peaches, about 125 Lbs., all organic and we know exactly what is in them. Compost, water, and a little manure, a tree and that's it! No bugs either!!!Canning startedRoom for peachesAll done, 25 Qts. canned (10 Spiced)  and 10 Qts frozen. I made spiced peaches with clove and cinnamon sticks, should be nice for the holidays! More apples will fill another shelf soon.Peach crumbleWe also have our apple tree which is really loaded and should be ripe in another month or so-I made a big batch of pasta sauce with our tomatoes last weekend and froze half of it. Dave and I deep cleaned the freezer a week or so ago and it is filling up! Next month we'll be canning and freezing lots of apple products. The pears will be ripe then too, but we just eat them fresh and bake. This is when I'm really glad we have a dishwasher. I've thought in the past if I were by myself I'd pull it out and add shelves with basket. No I don't think so! Look at all those lovely clean jars-When I look at all the food that we can produce, except for meat proteins, I do feel really blessed. It's been 12 years of taking this lot from turf, a couple of trees and literally nothing else, to our very productive little homestead. It's been a ton of work, financial investment, sacrificing vacations, and yet here we are and we're both so happy. It's also still a work in progress. We want to add more edibles in the front yard- Strawberries, maybe some raised beds, less turf. A lot of people we know wonder why we enjoy spending weekends at home especially in nice weather. Maybe if they took a tour of our homestead they would understand a little more. Next winter, when it's cold outside, we can have our own green beans, canned peaches, and maybe a homegrown apple pie. Then there's all of our wonderful eggs! So while I thought I'd like to live out in the country, I realize (except more room for goats and a beehive) I think this is pretty much it. And I can live with that."},

{"title": "Saving Our Peach Tree, Harvesting & Freezing Time, A Short Mountain Adventure", "date": "Aug 7, 2019", "text": "Saving Our Peach Tree-We planted our Peach tree about 4 years ago. It was pretty sick last year with peach tree rust, but we treated it and it did much better this spring. It really blossomed with the mild wet spring and we were very hopeful. We have lots of peaches and the tree seemed really healthy. We came home last week with a really large branch down on the ground split from another main branch. Pretty sad! Where it's split we could have cut the other part of the branch off , but we would have lost a ton of peaches and fruit. We had had our apple tree hit by a pickup truck when part of the branch was leaning over the easement a few years ago. I remembered that some people had taken washers, big screws and screwed together broken parts of branches hoping that the tree would heal itself and grow back together. I asked Dave to do that and the apple tree is still healthy-I asked Dave to go ahead and do that for now, to try to get the fruit ripe and then if it didn't heal up we could go ahead and take that one branch down later. So, that's what he did-We propped up the rest of the branches-The peaches are just about ripe probably, another week or so. We had our first two that were really great. Lesson learned that in the future we need to really thin the peaches more when they are still small. It's easy to get ahead of yourself and think wow look at all that fruit, instead of what do we need to also preserve the tree. So we will be more careful next spring and we are hopeful that branch will stay together as is? At this point we'll wait and see.... if needed we'll prune it off.Harvesting & Freezing Time-This is a time of year when we've started harvesting- tomatoes, two kinds of cucumbers, 4 kinds of peppers, the last of the chokecherries and blackberries. Corn will be ready soon too! We have a really good harvest of our green beans on going as well. I wanted to freeze them, but I wasn't sure if I needed to blanch them. I read this article so I'm going to try this recipe AnOregonCottage.comI'm going to be making lots of different vegetable dishes with our harvested veggies. I am going to be freezing the chokecherries as well. When the peaches get ripe here soon I'm going to be freezing and canning some. We just don't eat that much jam anymore, so I don't know if I'll bother with that, but I can always make some later from the frozen peaches. The peaches freeze really great! I just quarter them, toss them in Fruit Fresh so they don't turn brown, put in a double Ziploc bags and suck all the air out with a straw. They keep great. I'm getting a good Basil harvest soon, time to make and freeze pesto!A Short Mountain Adventure-I was really restless to get up in the mountains Saturday, so I told Dave we were going somewhere but didn't tell him where. We drove up to Bogus Basin, which is a small ski area, about 40 minutes from our house. It's about 7,500 feet up. When we got to the top of the open parking I took a side road hoping to find a nice fairly level hiking trail. Most of them turned out to be really steep so I decided to turn around and go back. We decided to take the chairlift at the top and that was where the real adventure started! You could see the start of fire season here with some of the forest fires.I thought the cell phone towers pretty well ruined the view up there, no escaping technology!Here is what we found- lots of really beautiful flowers, Lupines, Queen Ann's lace, Junipers, grasses, sage, not sure of the rest...The rest of it was really fun, walked down a path a ways until it was closed off to let the flowers come back. It's on National Forest land.I took lots of photos, but to get there you had to take a chair lift, which means we needed to sign a legal disclaimer. I have never seen that anywhere, which was a red flag for me. We got on fine at the bottom of the lift. At the top staff got 2 mountain bikes off the chair lift rack, set aside on the top of the ramp, then two mountains bikers got off ahead of us. They didn't grab their bikes and move, and we had almost nowhere to go (small space)! We almost got knocked down by the lift. The bikers just stood there instead of going down the wood ramp.  Staff didn't stop the lift or yell at them to move. Going down, getting off the lift was jerky and didn't stop very slow to get off, again, had to jump out of the way. Staff needs more safety training, but maybe they don't care since you can't sue them. We're done with that, not going back. Brundage Mountain, by comparison, was safe and much better!"},
{"title": "Independence Days Challenge", "date": "Jul 28, 2019", "text": "Independence Days Challenge-We finally hit 100 degrees in the last week! All the  turf, flowers and veggie beds are very well-mulched, but now it's water, water, water. Here's an update of what we've been up to...1. Plant Something- I have killed all the Bee Balms I've ever planted, for some unknown reason. I just bought two, half priced, and planted them. Hopefully at least one will survive! I put one in the front yard flower bed, and one in a pot on the back deck, pot on the right-2. Harvest Something- Tons of eggs, 3-4 per day! I've been giving some to our kiddos.  Picked our first green beans, Black Berries, small tomatoes, 1st batch of Chokecherries, harvested about 2 cups, lots more coming soon!  Still getting good growth on the kale, and the collard greens in the raised bed-The thorn-less blackberries are huge this year!Herb box doing well, pretty soon I'll make some pesto to freeze-3. Preserve/Store Something-Freezing the Chokecherries to make jelly later when it's cooler-I had a \"duh\" moment a while back- I read somewhere to just freeze berries and make jellies in the winter, when it's cooler. So that's the plan. Apples and peaches coming along well, not too many pears for some reason. Corn is almost as high as an elephant's eye! It is looking great!4. Manage Reserves- Get a GoodDeal/Barter/Stock Up/Prep-Bought several clearance boxes of 1 gallon Ziploc plastic bags for freezing some of the fruits and veggies. Bought some extra boxes of teabags to stash for later. 5. Eat the Food- Try NewFoods/Recipe-Mama Pea from Ahomegrownjournal.blogspot.com shared her recipe for shortcake, which I made, delish and easy! Shortcake Recipe:2 cups all-purpose flour - I used WW Pastry flour2 TBL sugar1 TBL baking powder½ teaspoon salt ½ cup butter1 beaten egg2/3 cup milk1 TBL sugar, sprinkled on top- my idea  6 cups fresh strawberries, sliced, ¼ cup sugar. 1 cup whipping cream w/ 2 tablespoons sugarStir together strawberries and ¼ cup sugar, set aside.  For shortcake, thoroughly stir together flour, 2 tablespoons sugar, baking powder and salt.  Cut in  the ½ cup butter til mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Combine beaten egg, milk and add all at once to dry ingredients and stir just to moisten. Spread dough (it will be very thick) in a well-greased 8\" round baking pan. Bake at 450 degrees for 15 to 18 minutes.  Then cool in pan for 10 minutes.  Remove from pan and split into 2 layers.  Lift top off carefully. Whip cream with 2 tablespoons sugar and spoon whipped cream and berries between layers and over top. With 2 of us, I left whole and served in a triangle wedge, then split drizzled with cream. The cake is plain and should keep the rest of the week.New shrimp recipe I tried was this Sweet Chili Garlic Shrimp .  I made for dinner tonight, it's a winner! I love the garlic and I used a little Cayenne since I didn't have the second hot sauce on hand.  I served with brown Jasmine rice and raw snow peapods. I could doing this with chicken or fish as well.6. Build Community Food Systems-No farmer's markets yet, too early for potatoes and other veggies we like. Dave got about 5 lbs. of free cherries from a co-worker. We shared with our kiddos.7. Recycle/Re-Use-Donated old clothes and highchair to charity. Bought like-new used slacks on eBay. Got a DVD for a movie from the library to watch. I LOVE libraries! At Goodwill I found a tall pretty Lighthouse for my beach table (sorry no pics) today, $4.00.8. Skill Up- Interesting reading about how some outsiders want to try and join the Amish. Very complicated situation it seems, but fascinating reading Can An Outsider Ever Truly Become Amish?9. Regenerate What is Lost/SalvageSomething-I was happy to see that my previously bug infested Mugo Pine has really recovered nicely. New green needles galore!"},
{"title": "The Other Side of Amazon Prime", "date": "Jul 16, 2019", "text": "Photo from Theverge.comThe Other Side of Amazon Prime-To be honest we all like a good deal. And we all buy stuff. One of the things I try to look at more and more over time is what I'm buying, and WHY. With a recent big deal of Amazon Prime days, coupled with watching the news, here are a few ideas that the mainstream media does not promote. As we all know Amazon has put a lot of companies out of business and that's part of the supposedly free market system. And they are very, very convenient, which is great for people who don't want to think a whole lot about how they actually shop. So here's a few different things I thought of that I will list. In no particular order....Why do you pay a fee to buy stuff? Prime membership always cracked me up.How many things to buy on Amazon that you could probably find locally and support local businesses assuming that you need something new?How many things could you buy used or recycled, through various venues, instead of buying something new on Amazon? Maybe get free on Craigslist? Or barter?How many things could you restore/reuse instead of buying something new on Amazon? Like our wheelbarrow we re-painted and added new hardware to-How many things could you find online through smaller companies, they have just as many deals and the same products, that you could support instead?How much stuff do you really need? To me that's really the biggest question. Good ideas, and maybe some answers here-And how much of your old stuff winds up in a landfill?Where are you going to store all your store when you run of of room?It's been on and off in the news for quite a while about how dangerous, and punitive it is, working for Amazon. Not drinking water on the job, because then your count goes down when you use the bathroom. (See the article at the for more information). When I started seeing their trucks around town on the weekends I just sort of shook my head. They're catering to people who want instant gratification, all the time, for everything. This country has no patience and no deep thinking sometimes. How about simplify?Homesteading to me harkens back to older times, when we were more self-sufficient and made do with a lot less. I had to laugh when I watched the movie Red Sparrow. There was a section in the beginning when a Russian teacher is instructing her class of spies-in-the making, that Americans are addicted to their shopping and their social media. I almost burst out laughing the theater. How true, how true. But I think it really hit the nail on the head for me for how the country is moving. I see that speed shopping encourages people to become so lazy that they don't want to drive anywhere, to buy anything, and or even get out of the car. Some people simply want to press some buttons on a device. It's mindless and it's promoting a scary future in this country... There is hope though, book stores are making a comeback!!! So here's some ideas-From Lilywilliamsart.com"},

We had an unusual thunderstorm last night, which brought heavy rain for and hour or so. What a relief!!! Years ago I found this great post on a old, abandoned blog Hazeleyessue.blogspot.com, I saw her photo-I spied a mini-lemon garland! I'd never had seen those before. I looked for them and last year finally found some. This winter, when it was really gray, I stumbled onto some really cute living room and kitchen decor with lemons and lots of yellow. It really got me thinking about adding some brightness in the kitchen and dining room. I already had some things with lemons on them so I just got a few other things to go with them...I found some really cute ceramic lemons from Target for a dollar each, on two different trips, and bought six total. Love them!Then I found this Michel Design Works really gorgeous tea towel on eBay for $8. Love the yellows,  flowers and the bird. It's called Tranquility-I had an old blue Ball jar with small lemons, sits on the counterI already had the lemon topiary I made out of a existing blue ceramic pot, using twigs, moss and faux lemonsOriginally I had wanted to buy a blue Keurig coffee maker off of QVC. Years ago they had a really great deal, but they were out and so I bought a yellow one. It's grown on me overtime! I also found a thrifted cute little coffee bean container, to add a little more yellow.Finally I had a really pretty French country ceramic breadbox, and put my jar of yellow Polenta out on the counter, in front of a French country tray. Maybe this will inspire you to add some sunny yellow to your home!!! Or go make some lemonade! Stay cool my friends...Photo from Veggies Allowed in Forida By LawFlorida Now Allows Growing Veggie In Front Yards-It's great to see someone beat city hall, or in this case, the state. Love these people and their tenacity! Click on link above for full story. Awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Smart Governor.Re-Creating American Hero Sandwich-Recently on our Baker City road trip I had an American Hero sandwich. I tried-recreating it at home, not the best photo, sorry. I used Ciabatta bread since I had it on hand, instead of their amazing Focaccia bread. Basically here it is-Ingredients-Sliced Roast beef, Pepperoni slices, sharp cheddar cheese slices, Horseradish mixed with sour cream. You could add lettuce and tomato, etc. Obviously this is not plant based! Slice bread into a rectangle, mix sour cream and pure horseradish to taste, you want it hot, but not blistering. Layer meats and cheese, I served with chips and veggies. You could really play with this recipe and add olives, change the meats, etc. Nice dinner for a hot night!"},
{"title": "Lavender Festival, Independence Days Challenge, Road Trip", "date": "Jul 9, 2019", "text": "Lavender Festival-Every year I always miss the Lavender Festival outside of Boise at Thelavendermerchant.net. This time I was smart and marked it on my calendar extra early! It's really a fun place to go, lots of arts and crafts for sale, some food/ drinks, and lots of U-Pick lavenders of several different varieties. I wasn't really sure if I wanted to pick lavender because I already had some at home so I decided to pass on that. I did take lots of photos of bees which was great. I have never seen so many bees in a small area before!!!  I thought the Lavender Festival area would be bigger, but they do a good job with the space they have. It's not like France where you see hills and hills covered with lavender. Instead it was probably about a half an acre of solid lavender, about 8 varieties. They rent the space for weddings, photo shoots, etc. Here's some photos of what I saw, but it didn't take any pictures of the crowds so as not to invade people's space. Check for bees in the photos!Melissa white Lavender, great scent!There were a couple of vendors in beautiful tents that had some really cute, but overpriced for me, lavender-oriented items. Way too much for my budget, but I did find this Pewter Revere candy dish with feet for $5. I didn't really care about the black spots but it did Shine up quite a bit more with silver polishIndependence Days Challenge-1. Plant SomethingWe have all our veggies and things planted so far so I think we're probably done for now. I will buy more Cilantro if I can find it since the bugs ate mine.2. Harvest Something- Eggs!!! Lavender, but I left some for the bees, more lavender mini-bunches in both bathrooms-Got our first summer berries- raspberries/blackberries, and cherry tomatoes. Picked first Marconi pepper, supposed to be red, but harvested early-3. Preserve/Store Something-Dave harvested our neighbor's Rhubarb that she hates! Washed and laid out on baking sheets to freezer, got several Qts. The peach tree is really loaded so we should start harvesting peaches in about two to three weeks, maybe. Dave harvested the last of the Service berries, about a 1/2 Qt. The full total is about 2.5 gallons! That's crazy!!!4. Manage Reserves- Get a GoodDeal/Barter/Stock Up/Prep-Leaving freezer space for fruit from trees and tomatoes. Got 2 really fun, heavy paper buntings on eBay, $5.00 each!5. Eat the Food- Try NewFoods/Recipe-I saw Jamie Oliver last night on PBS with a recipe I have to try- Jamieoliver.com  Only 5 ingredients, quick flat bread, with mango chutney, cooked eggs, red chili, yogurt! Looks great!Chutney for the above from Cost Plus. I'll make some homemade peach chutney to can this summer-Found a fun Greek, vegan food also at Cost Plus-For the rhubarb I tried this new recipe Rhubarb Coffee Cake  It came out great, nice and moist. With my new cookbook from our plant-based diet classes, my new fave is here-I used spinach instead of Arugula and used ready to eat, roasted canned red bell peppers. It's FABULOUS!!! I added our fresh tomatoes, and you could switch things up. Use raisins instead of figs, etc. The dressing would be good on shrimp too-6. Build Community Food Systems-Haven't been any farmers markets yet for what I want. Waiting for some peaches and apples of different varieties to come into season.7. Recycle/Re-Use-Dave mixed last summer's potting soil with manure and compost to lighten it up. Potato seeds failed so we recycled. Donated misc. household stuff and toddler toys. Grandsons are getting too big! 8. Skill Up-Learned all about how to clean pewter! And there are 3 different kinds of pewter, who knew!9. Regenerate What is Lost/SalvageSomething-Mixed up the potting soil and cleaned up the pewter.Road Trip-Dave and I both decided we wanted to get out of the town for the day on the 4th of July. Sadly we both had to work on the 5th so there was no 4 day weekend for us. We decided to go to Baker City, Oregon since it's only a short 2 hour/easy drive. Since is higher in elevation it's about 10 degrees cooler, and there has lots of fun things to do. There was no way we were going to stay until midnight to watch fireworks, get up to go to work in the morning after driving all the way back. So we had breakfast and then hit the road and had a nice lunch at one of our favorite places AJ's Corner Brick Bar and Grill-It has lots of sandwiches, burgers and brews. They had one of the best sandwiches I've ever had, an American Hero. It had homemade focaccia bread, roast beef, sharp cheddar cheese, pepperoni, and horseradish in sour cream. The bread was really light and toasty, not heavy and you really got some of the spiciness from the ingredients. I'm going to make this at home, I know, not plant-based! We hit a small flea market outside town, way up in the mountains. Gorgeous drive, but prices too high. Hit a storage unit sale outside Baker, then stupidly realized neither of us had much cash, they didn't take plastic, and we didn't have a check.  Oh well, live and learn. We got home about 6 p.m., had dinner and watched some of the fireworks on TV before we conked out. Sadly one of our neighbors decided to do his annual way too loud, very illegal, fireworks sharing. He does the big booming, deep rumble ones. I don't know what time I fell asleep, but it woke up Dave up at 2 a.m. Luckily it was slow at work on the 5th.  I'd love to find out who it is and turn them in to the cops, but I don't know that they would actually do anything. If you're going to do all that noise all hours of the day and night, go out in the middle of nowhere, that's my motto."},

{"title": "Too Many Eggs = Citrus Angel Food Cake! Harvesting of The Purple", "date": "Jul 2, 2019", "text": "Too Many Eggs = Angel Food Cake!I had so many eggs today, about 3 dozen I got busy! First I hard boiled 12 eggs, then I made my favorite Citrus Angel Food Cake recipe-Makes: 12 servings, Prep: 30 minutes, Bake: 40 minutesIngredients:    I added 1 TSP teaspoon pure orange extract, since I like it like that. You could do lemon or lime as well. I have subbed honey when I was out of orange juice concentrate.1 1/2  cups egg whites (10 to 12)1 1/2  cups sifted powdered sugar1  cup sifted cake flour or sifted all-purpose flour1  teaspoon cream of tartar3  tablespoons frozen Orange juice concentrate, thawed3/4  cup granulated sugarDirections- In a covered large bowl, let egg whites stand at room temperature for 30 minutes. Sift the powdered sugar and flour together, set aside. Preheat oven to 350°F. Add cream of tartar to egg whites in bowl; beat with an electric mixer on medium speed until soft peaks form (tips curl). Add juice concentrate. Gradually add granulated sugar, about 2 tablespoons at a time, beating until stiff peaks form (tips stand straight).Sift about one-fourth of the flour mixture over beaten egg white mixture; fold in gently, DO NOT BEAT. (If the bowl is too full, transfer mixture to a larger bowl.) Repeat, folding in the remaining flour mixture by fourths. Pour batter into an ungreased 10-inch tube pan; spread evenly. Bake on the lowest oven rack for 40 to 45 minutes or until the top springs back when lightly touched. Immediately invert cake (leave in pan); cool thoroughly. (If the cake has risen higher than the pan, invert it over a jar or bottle so the top of the cake does not touch the counter top.) To serve, loosen side and center from pan with a narrow spatula; remove cake. Using a serrated knife, cut into wedges. Great with fresh fruit!Harvesting Purple-As I've mentioned before we had a really wet April and May this year.  All of our perennials have done really well because of that. This lavender I planted in the backyard years ago just really exploded with blossoms this year! The bees have been loving it as well, so when I decided to harvest some I decided to leave some for them-Little bee in the middleI got a really nice bouquet of fresh English lavender, will dry it for inside while the rest stays outside. Gotta give the bees some food!Dave harvested another one gallon of Service berries! They're going into the freezer for later projects. I planted Service berries because they're indigenous to Idaho, and the rain really helped them go to town this year. I think there may be about one more gallon left on the plant but we will see. One of the great things I love about Permaculture, and growing your own food, is it we hardly ever even fertilize the plants. We just work on having healthy soil, the rest seems to usually take care of itself! Except for the crappy clay soil, that is!"},

They put up electric fencing and go to work. The weeds were about 3' - 4' high when they started. They've made good progress in the last week. I smile as I drive by every morning on the way to work! I took these photos while Dave was driving so I didn't run off the road. Wish I'd have gotten better photos, but there's no where to park. They have water and plenty of shade, and only in the 70's this week. Its a pretty great job they do, and no herbicides! They're used around Boise in different areas and it's a great program!!!"},

I bought the last of our veggies this weekend to plant. I bought a Japanese Itchiban eggplant, three small pots of lemon cucumbers to help out with the ones that are a little bit sick from the bad weather. I bought two red  and 2 green bell peppers, several basil and some flowers for the pots-My baby Basils ready to plant in a pot My Nasturtiums I started from seed have doing really great, they're just not flowering yet-Unless I see a really great deal into next month or two for leftover tomatoes at the local nurseries I think we're pretty well done. The corn, beans, and small decorative pumpkins we started from seed are doing great-Dave already harvested (he's taller!) 2 Qts. of Service Berries, many more to come. They loved the wet spring. I may make jam, or some small tarts, or both. Nothing like growing your own food!More flowers from the front yard-SpireaPollinator, but can't remember which one!YarrowRed Hot Poker, almost 40 blooms, crazy with the wet weather too!  First berries, Red Twig Dogwood, not edible sadlySea ThriftRosesVictoria Sponge Cake with Strawberries & Coconut CreamI always wanted to make a Victoria sponge cake with fresh strawberries. There are a lot of recipes out there, but many are with UK measurements which doesn't work very well for me. I finally found a recipe and decided to try it and was really disappointed. Both cakes fell, which is ever happened to me before in my life. I'm not posting the recipe here since it was not a good one apparently. I realized after the fact that 375° was just too hot for cakes, that should have been cooler with a longer bake time. I did try microwaving the one that was still pretty warm for several minutes to see if it would hopefully cook the batter in the center. When website suggested if your cake fails in the middle or falls in the middle to simply serve it in slices or in a cup with the other ingredients. The second cake came out nice and moist. Disappointing for a Father's Day dessert. Sad, will try a different recipe next time. No More Cake Fails ideas here.This was a success though, making coconut cream! Since Dave can't do dairy I decided to make this for the cake. Basically I followed the directions on the can-refrigerate overnight (I put in the freezer for 1 hour or so). Spoon out the solid thick cream. I put in as mixing bowl, added 1/2 teaspoon vanilla, 1 TBS powdered sugar and whipped. It was very stiff. I added more of the milk liquid until it got to the right consistency. I used two cans of this which was perfect for the cake-It was nice and fluffy and didn't soak the cake the way cream would. I could see adding lemon extract, etc. next time for another flavor.Pasta & Peas-One thing I learned from a more plant-based diet is peas are packed with protein! Who knew! I thought they were pure carbs and felt guilty eating them. I added some to whole grain pasta, and topped with an egg. Add some Parmesan cheese and it's what for dinner!"},

Independence Days Challenge", "date": "Jun 10, 2019", "text": "Finally Some Warm Weather!After a cold end of the week, and weekend, it's finally warming up again. Hopefully for good! It was 39 degrees Friday night and only hit low 70's yesterday. Low 80's today, and we're going to hit the mid 80's most of next week. The veggie garden should start to take off more! The yarden, front and back is so green!Independence Days Challenge-Here's what we've been up to!1. Plant Something- Have been trying to harden off my baby Basil's and squash, but just too cold. Will start again this week.2. Harvest Something- Lots of eggs and herbs! Herbs have just gone nuts-Kale and collard greens are ready and mixed lettuces. The cooler, wet weather was great for them!My Spanish lavender is loving it's spot, going thru a second bloom!3. Preserve/Store Something- I froze 1/2 of my baking yesterday. Last weekend I made Oatmeal Chocolate Chip cookies with whole wheat pasty flour and froze some. Canning will start in another month or so when our early ripening peaches come in. We should have a good harvest! Then we'll have apples and pears. Our Choke Cherry and Service berries bushes are loaded. I'll make Choke Cherry jelly and save up the Service berries and freeze. Once I have enough I'l make jams or maybe a fruit bread.4. Manage Reserves- Get a Good Deal/Barter/Stock Up/Prep- Got a great deal on nuts, whole grain pitas, organic cereals and jams yesterday at Costco. Scored a nice, cheap office desk chair as well. Bought some bulk Falafel mix, much cheaper than buying in a box. We're lucky we have a Winco five minutes from our home, with all Bob's Red Mills in their huge bulk section. I found some Reebok sneakers 1/2 off on their website, with $7.00 shipping. A steal! I have to take care of my feet.5. Eat the Food- Try New Foods/Recipe- I had some left-over homemade applesauce and over-ripe bananas. What to do? Make a new recipe Banana Applesauce Oatmeal Bread It's basically no fat, except the egg. I also added about 3/4 cup chopped walnuts, and left out the honey. I'll freeze 1/2 for later.We've been eating a lot more produce and grains with moving towards a more plant-based diet. Still eating some meats, but pretty much eliminated most white flour/sugar. More on that later...6. Build Community Food Systems- Too early for the farmer's market yet.7. Recycle/Re-Use- Dave went looking for used angle iron, but found commercial shelf brackets. The 2\" x 4\"s he had on our homemade compost sifter was way too heavy. He had a friend spot weld it to the metal sifter. It's much lighter and easier for him to use. This was his idea, by the way, sifting compost!8. Skill Up-  I've learned a TON about Permaculture from the book Paradise Lot. It has given me lots of ideas, from Nitrogen-fixing trees to planting more less-common fruits and veggies. Great info and very easy to understand, compared to other complicated Permaculture books.9. Regenerate What is Lost/Salvage Something- Me! I joined a gym with Dave, new by our house, and only $10.00 month. I'm working on building up walking distance, doing upper body work and general strengthening. Getting some regular, systematic exercise is what I really need. Something I can track and measure, and gauge as to how I'm doing. It will be hot soon, and this will be great when it's 110 outside! I did a full hour yesterday, and I'm proud of myself."},

We have really severe gusting winds, and it looked like a dust storm in downtown Boise late this afternoon. When I was sitting at home tonite I heard a loud thud on the top of the roof and thought here we go!  I went outside to see how big the branch was that got blown off the tree, and luckily it was a little one, no damage done. While I don't mind a little rain and cool weather it seems like it's really hard getting the summer garden started. But that's the breaks and I certainly don't want to complain too much after seeing what's happened in the midwest. The low tonight is supposed to be 49° and the low tomorrow night is supposed to be 40. I'll be putting an extra blanket back on the bed and wearing my winter jammies again, even though it's supposed to be summer. The good news is it's supposed to warm up back up to the 80's next week so this should be a temporary glitch on the weather map so to speak. Here's hoping for summer finally!

Update *** The local news station announced this is the fourth wettest May ever, along with the 4th wettest April ever! *** Having said that, this in no way compares to the terrible flooding and tornadoes in the mid-West and East. So sorry for them! Everything is super saturated from the last couple of days-Everything is so lush and green! We have had to put quite a bit on hold as far as planting veggies, etc. We have been able to work around some of it. The wheelbarrow in the backyard,  with the bark dust, had to wait because of the weather. My perennials are really loving all the rain, however, and everything is really blooming, very lush and green. It's been in the low 70s the last couple of days and it's supposed to hit the 80s this weekend. Hopefully after that it should be dry for at least a week. Hooray!More tonight! There's thunder and lightning right now!Paradise Lot Book Review-I stumbled onto this book and got a copy from the library to read. What a find!!! These two men worked together to transform an empty tenth-of-an-acre lot on the east coast in Holyoke, Massachusetts. The lot was barren ground, had poor compacted soil, with broken concrete, etc. They turned it into an incredible, productive, beautiful Permaculture garden. I got so many edible gardening ideas from this book (that I'm not even done with) that I bought a copy. There are all kinds of perennials that have edible leaves that I had never even heard of! I'm really may go off and do some unusual things with our garden now that I have more interesting ideas. The photos will definitely tell the story, but I highly advise the book as well! Just a real gem. As a side note, they also did this with free, used, scavenged, foraged and bartered items. On a micro budget!Before backyard, photos from ParadiselotblogA few years laterRead it!"},
{"title": "Making Those Tough Gardening & Homesteading Decisions, Urban Permaculture Inspiring Videos! ", "date": "May 22, 2019", "text": "Making Those Tough Gardening & Homesteading Decisions-Sometimes in gardening, and urban homesteading, you have to make tough decisions. If you have a  homestead in a rural area with a lot of acreage sometimes those tough decisions are different kinds of decisions. In a small urban Homestead, on a small city lot, we have limited space and have to grow what is useful and productive. Sometimes things get moved around, sometimes things get discontinued, like giant monster tomatoes that took 3 months to ripen! I was looking on the north side of our house this weekend and noticed our Mugo pine looked really really sick. I found out the insects that were there were European Pine Sawfly larvae. The bad news is they eat the needles, but the good news is they will grow back. The other bad news is if you don't treat the shrub, theoretically you could lose it. I've never used insecticidal sprays before of any kind, so this time I decided to make an exception. Luckily the tree had nothing growing around it, especially anything edible or where anyone walks.  I did some research and went ahead and bought a small spray bottle of Sevin, which is basically a neurotoxin bug spray. I doused the Mugo Pine and all the little Sawtooth larvae started falling off.All goneThe good news is hopefully I'll never have to do this again! I think the unusually wet April that we had may have contributed to this since I've never seen this before anywhere. It was the fourth wettest April on record ever. Too much rain. Still raining this last week, with temps in the 50's and 40's at night. Put the heavier bedding back on the bed and got out my winter PJ's!Rhubarb before shot, with potato binThe next decision was to tear out our rhubarb patch. I had tried growing rhubarb in three different places on our lot and just didn't have much luck. This last location was sunny, with some shade, and it would grow really well but then it would never turn red. Since our neighbor next door hates rhubarb, and has a huge plant and let's us take it, it really didn't make sense to use valuable garden space for that. Dave ripped it up and it went into the compost bin for the city. I very successfully grown squash in that spot so we will probably plant either squash or pumpkins. It will also allow some more room for the raspberries to spread.  Here in a small urban space when room is at a premium you just have to make those tough decisions of what you can grow versus what you want to grow. After shot-From Retrosuburbia.comUrban Permaculture Inspiring Videos!These are Urban Permaculture based, but you will see tons of flexible ideas you can use anywhere! We don't live in the \"suburbs\" but many urban (or rural) areas can take these ideas and run with them.

Vegetarian Salad", "date": "May 18, 2019", "text": "Before ShotRe-Painting a Weather Vane-Here's the post about how we bought this little cutie-  A Man's Life Saved...  After Dave put it up on top of the coop last fall I decided that I would just wait until spring to paint it. There's a photo below what the original look like that I found online, although there were lots of versions-What it looked like when we took it down -Basically years of weathering, etc. made it pretty faded paint-wise. The gold spheres in the photo were reduced to just silver aluminum. I decided to go with flat black for the basic components, the same green for the grass, and a medium brown for the spheres. Dave set up a workbench for me in the backyard. Sadly it was cool, breezy and a bit shady and so the paint took longer to dry. Was also a little challenging taking photos since the lighting was so random. First I washed all the components in warm soapy water with Dawn and then dried them. Next I just laid out all the paints and masking tape.First I covered up the deer area with a clean ziploc bag and masking tape. I wanted to basically repaint the green area and not transfer too much to the deer and the black paint area. I decided to leave it as is.  Some of the versions of this had the light tan paint.I started off by painting the green grass below the deer and then set that aside to dry. Next I painted all of the black pieces flat black, just shows very shiny when it was wet. I did each side and then waited a while and then did the other side.Next I did the silver aluminum spheres. I knew they would be challenging since the aluminum was really smooth and probably wouldn't grab the paint as well. They took several coats and there were a few drip marks, but it's 10 feet up in the air, who will notice!Last I just touched up in the areas that still needed a few spots of paint. After it was all dry Dave put it back together and up on top of the coop. I love the way it came out! Looks almost like new. Should last another 50 years hopefully.After shotChipotle Jackfruit Tacos- I found this recipe and gave it a shot, and it came out nice! I did use about 1/3 can of  adobo sauce, too bland as is. Recipe here- ForksoverknivesS.W. Vegetarian Salad-I used to make this with chicken, just omitted it, and used the rest of the ingredients. I used the On The Border Spicy Dressing, some Cojito cheese on top, came out great! The long thin strips are Jicama, crunchy, sweet and so good for you! Didn't miss the meat..."},
{"title": "Building New Tomato Cages, Peach Crisp,  Vegan Spaghetti Sauce With Lentils", "date": "May 15, 2019", "text": "Building New Tomato Cages-We have tried so many different tomato cages over the years that it's not even funny. We tried the old-fashioned wire ones that you can buy that are cone-shaped, when the tomatoes got too big it would all fall over. Then we bought some metal wire ones that were hinged and great to store, but were too lightweight and would also fall over. We tried bamboo, it would crack and fall apart. Then we finally started using scrap conduit from work from Dave, and it was tough and rugged. The problem was you couldn't really tie the tomatoes up to it or it would all slide down. Dave had the idea to just build some new wooden tomato cages. He looked around and we talked about sizes and then this weekend  he bought some nice culled wood. Culled wood is wood that is warped/twisted/bent and is not sold at the normal retail price. Most places that sell it, like the big box stores, sell it 50% to 70% off! That's a huge savings. So Dave shopped around at both of the big box stores in our area and bought some pine furring strips. He used 1\" x 2\"s, and 1\" x 4\"s cut down to 1\" x 2\"s-wood ready to be unloadedThey're nice and sturdy and should last quite a few years! He made about four foot high, 16\" square, with galvanized nails.  Here's the tomato area, he created a new \"chicken\" fence, much nicer than what was there before.More cages-Planted and sunk down in the ground about one foot, dug small hole and back filled-Peach Crisp-I'm working on emptying out some of the things in our freezer since we have three fruit trees that are pretty full and summer veggies will be ready in a few months. I had some amazing peaches frozen from one of Dave's co-workers and so decided to make this Peach Crisp  It came out really super luscious! I used WW pastry flour and cut down the sugar since the peaches were dead ripe.Vegan Spaghetti Sauce With Lentils-Since we're working on more of a plant-based diet I decided to add some canned brown lentils to a big pot of homemade spaghetti sauce. I used some of our organic homegrown frozen tomatoes and Italian peppers from last summer. To that I added one chopped onion, 3 cups sliced mushrooms, all the normal spices like fresh garlic, oregano, basil, thyme, etc. I added the lentils last and then cooked down the sauce for about 2 or 3 hours. Came out nice and hardy and no lentil flavor at all! All in all it's a keeper. More protein, tons of fiber, and literally no fat, except about 1 TBL to saute the garlic and onions!"},

Blue skies and milder, but still cold at night. 33 degrees is forecast for tonight, with more of the same the next four days. We covered our newly planted herb box with row cover for protection. Local folks are planting tomatoes, I hope they're covering those! The fruit trees are gorgeous, with tons of blossoms. So here's a look at what we've been up to!1. Plant Something-Filled up my herb box, all but one of my plants died over the winter. Lost my rosemary and thyme. Re-planted those, plus cilantro and Italian parsley. Need to buy thyme as the store was out. It was nice to see the big box store selling organic herbs plants! Dave also planted the cold frame, with Collard greens, Curly kale and Rainbow Swiss chard. We covered it with bird netting, otherwise the birds will eat them. The mixed lettuce is doing well, nice and green. I bought a nice Spanish Lavender topiary that I transplanted into larger pot, love the flowers!Before  AfterI added some sparkly broken flagstone2. Harvest Something-Lots of eggs, sometimes 4 per day! Hopefully we will have lots of fruit this year, based on the look of the fruit trees! We have an apple, pear and peach tree-Apple blossoms3. Preserve/Store Something-Freezing extra foods. Fruit canning will come soon!4. Manage Reserves- Get a GoodDeal/Barter/Stock Up/Prep-Did a major clean out of  kitchen cupboards and fridge. Bought a lot of bulk grains, nuts and seeds. Luckily we have a Grocery Outlet and Natural Grocer's close by, good deals there! We found out a new Trader Joe's will be built closer to out house, nice! There's one downtown near where I work but traffic is crazy sometimes, and I'd like to go on the weekends when I have more time. 5. Eat the Food- Try NewFoods/Recipe-Getting lots of new plant based recipe ideas, great source here Forksoverknives Recipes . The class we're taking has a recipe book as well, and we always ate some vegetarian foods before. As you know we'll keep eating eggs! Having your own chickens clinches the deal for us. Last week I made  whole grain pasta with homemade pesto, asparagus, with 2 eggs on top, a little Parmesan cheese. Delish! I learned about Jack Fruit as well, a good meat substitute with huge health benefits. This weekend we tried Trader Joe's veggie burgers, with avocado, salsa, a little Cojito cheese on whole wheat buns-Very nutritious!I made my Greek chicken salad with garbanzo beans instead, pretty good-I saw this recipe, good since we have lots of eggs. I thought I'd try these-Photo from Bonappetit Soy Marinated Eggs6. Build Community Food Systems-No farmer's market trips yet here, too early for the good stuff! I like to buy local apples, taters and other summer crops I don't/can't grow. 7. Recycle/Re-Use-Filled up one of my old pots with nasturtium seeds on the deck. I will some other old ones with our indoor Basil starts, too cold right now. I'll fill the rest with some Calendula seeds. All the weeds, grasses, etc. went into the compost bin.8. Skill Up-Learning a lot about plant-based eating and the huge heath benefits. I'll be off some long term meds soon, from what I can tell. Losing weight, and my tummy is getting flatter! More info later as time goes on.9. Regenerate What is Lost/SalvageSomething- Our front center flow bed in the front yard was pretty overgrown with grasses after 10 years. I thought it was too green and we needed more colors. I bought three new perennial plants, pollinators too! Dave cleared out the invasive stuff, composted, planted, and bark dusted. Looks so much better! Under $25.00 investment for the whole thing. Just a lot of digging, used our own compost, and all the grassed went into the compost bin-Heavy clay soil around flower bed, Dave added compostOvergrown with grassesAdded blue Salvia, tall pink Thrift, and Red Twig Dogwood in the middle has room!Multi colored pink daisies in front"},

Feeling better, losing some weight and am hopeful this will be easier to sustain than I originally thought. We're doing a class, but more about that later... So...I had to add this first! These spicy black bean cakes, from an early Katie Brown Entertains cook book, are an all time fave here! Everyone who's tried them loved them! Couldn't find it online, so I copied off my cook book page. The Tabasco is a must or you'd have bland beans. Here you go...Spicy Black Bean CakesYou'll need:4 cups canned black beans well drained and rinsed, or start with dried black beans if you like. Half a cup of thinly sliced green onions or scallions. Half a cup of chopped roasted red bell peppers. 6 TBL of flour, more for dustingTwo teaspoons of Tabasco sauce, this makes the recipe!!! Two teaspoons of salt, yes you need that much!One teaspoon of freshly ground black pepper6 tablespoons vegetable oil, 1 cup sour cream (optional) and   2 tablespoons of chopped chives.First- in a bowl lightly mash the beans, keeping some large pieces intact but creating some paste. Mix the beans together with the green onions, roasted red peppers, flour, Tabasco sauce and pepper. Form patties in your hand about half the size of a hamburger. Dust both size of the patties with flour. Heat oil in the pan over medium heat for about 3 minutes, until the oil is very hot. Fry cakes for about 5 minutes on each side, until the outside is crispy and fried. You can put in the oven to keep warm if you are making more. Top of sour cream mixed with chives, but this is optional if you're not doing dairy. Keeps well in the fridge!Amish Baked OatmealAnother fave, and easy to substitute nut milk for dairy, and use an egg substitute. I made the original for Easter breakfast, it was all gone fast! Recipe here- Amish Baked Oatmeal  You could also use other kinds of fruits, like blueberries and other stone fruits. It's great because you add simple ingredients, put in the oven and walk away. Keeps well in the fridge as well."},
{"title": "Moving To A More Plant Based Diet, New Flowers!", "date": "Apr 18, 2019", "text": "From Forksoverknives.comMoving To A More Plant Based Diet-Dave and I started recently moving to more of a plant-based diet. Basically eating a lot more whole foods, fruits and vegetables, less meat and dairy. We actually never ate a ton of meat anyway, maybe a couple times a week. There's tons of information online, but one of the tools I found really helpful was this one 5-to-1 Rule For Fiber In Packaged Foods  Basically you want to really increase your fiber to keep you feeling fuller longer and to be healthier. The 5 to 1 rule is you divide the total number of carbs by the total number of fiber grams. For instance if you have something that has 30 grams of carbs, and only 3 grams of fiber, that's 10, which is not good. If you have 30 grams of carbohydrates, with 6 grams of fiber, that's a 5 which is acceptable. Under 5 is even better! Basically the more fiber the better. It's always better to eat food as grown, which is basically the less processing/cooking the better. I'll post more information over time about what we're doing and we'll see how it goes. We're not giving up our eggs since we have our own chickens! What was really sad was learning that one of of three children in the U.S. will become DIABETIC! ONE OUT OF THREE! For parents this is going to come down to being diligent, reading labels of everything you feed your kids and making better choices. More whole grains, less sugar, no soda, no high sugar foods like the popular Gogurts and cereals. Luckily there are lots of options now.Bowl of Beauty Japanese PeonyNew Flowers!One of the realities of gardening is that you plant things and sometimes they die. Sometimes it's years later. Or sometimes you just want something different! We had two plants that finally had to be composted. I started doing some research about what to replace them with and found an interesting info. Since one of the areas was in shade and sun it was a little bit more tricky. It's right by our front entryway and front door and so I wanted something that would have nice foliage, possibly flowers, that would do well there. I found this nice article Shade Gardening Top 10 Shrubs For Shade  I stumbled on the Oakleaf Hydrangea. I did some research and thought it would be a good fit for there. We went to two nurseries today and I found the one in the Ruby color in stock!From Gurneys.comAnother flowering shrub we bought was a butterfly bush, a Blue Knight-Waltersgardens.comWe got a lighter color of butterfly bush since the one in the front yard is called Black Knight. We looked at several peonies for sale the nursery and we chose that one. We planted those on the weekend with a cool rainy week ahead. All three are also pollinators, which is something important to us.We also planted some mixed Mesclun lettuce mix today in a cold frame. The seeds are only a few years old so I'm hoping they're still viable? Time will tell. I store my seeds inside in a cool dark area. If they don't germinate I may buy some more and try again!"},

Strawberry Rhubarb Crumble, Pasta Salad With Salami, Being Sick Sucks, But....", "date": "Apr 8, 2019", "text": "Seeds Planted!It has really been raining, a very soggy yard we have! After being sick twice in a month we finally got everything together to plant! Bought potting soil, more trays and more seeds. Dave and I worked together in the garage and got everything planted and labelled. I had the idea to set up a work station with the saw horses and plywood. It was raining outside, again, so it worked great! The white bucket had potting soil and a scoop.Here's the haul:Herbs- Italian Parsley, Cilantro, Dill, BasilVeggies- Melrose Italian Peppers, Red Marconi Italian Peppers, Lemon Cukes, Rainbow Swiss Chard, Creole Collard Greens, Yellow Crookneck squash, Picklebush cukes, Zucchini.Flowers- Nasturtiums, Calendulas, Cornflowers and giant Marigolds.Ornamental pumpkins- Howden Jack O'Lanterns, orange Jack B Little, White Baby Boo.The rest will be planted out side- 2 kinds of poppies, corn, carrots, radishes and beans.Trays went into the bedroom rack and we will rotate trays with the grow light-Shelves pretty fullAfter seeing some old photos on my blog, I decided to move some perennials out of the backyard garden and use for more veggies. I'll move them to another area in the back or front yard. Better use of space. Starting seeds will save a lot of money. Since we couldn't use the greenhouse frame outside, with the crazy weather, inside was a better choice. With the grow light we'll rotate the trays, and move things outside when it warms up. We'll be about 6-8 weeks ahead of time, and save lots of $$$. It's a win win!Strawberry Rhubarb Crumble-Seeing our rhubarb growing, but not ready, reminded me I had some in the freezer from last year! I thawed some, along with organic strawberries, and made some dessert. I used this recipe-Epicurious.com  minus the vanilla and nuts. Came out great with a little whipping cream.Photo from AllrecipesPasta Salad With Salami-I wanted something easy for the weekend, and this was it! Allrecipes.com I added about 1/2 cup diced celery, and only used 1 packet of dressing mix, too salty otherwise. Keeps great!Being Sick Sucks, But....Last week I woke up at 1 a.m. on a work night with horrible cramps and diarrhea. The worst. I was up and down all night thinking it would stop, but no. At 5 a.m. I asked Dave to get me something from our hall closet. We keep our OTC meds there. I took something, then called in sick. Had to take a few more doses. I got up at 1.p.m., and made myself drink water, and eat some watery oatmeal. Late some soft fruit. I slept better that night, then got up to go to work. Then the weakness hit me, called in sick again. I went to work the next day, still a bit out of it. Friday felt quite a bit better. Luckily I had- PTO to cover the time loss More importantly, we had remedies on hand! I ALWAYS have Homeopathic cold, cough and flu remedies on hand. I also keep more \"modern\" drugs as well. It really pays to keep things on hand, so they're there when you need them! Be prepared!"},
{"title": "Free Water, Spring Gardening Clean Up Starts, Steel Cut Oats w/Fruit and Nuts, Aluminum Cans = Art", "date": "Apr 3, 2019", "text": "Free Water-With so many people going out and buying water, and having a home water bill, it might be odd to see something that says free water. That's where rain barrels come into play! At our last house when we had a 1/3 of an acre lot with high city water bills, our rain barrels were really helpful! One (or more) 55 gallon rain barrel is a great addition to any yard or garden. You can use it to water all kinds of things. Most rain barrels are elevated on a wooden frame or concrete blocks so that it is gravity-fed through a hose, making sure it's level. You can also use for watering cans for smaller jobs. We have ours elevated for that reason, easier to water larger sections. One of the other more important reasons would be if you had a water outage. Depending on the circumstances if your water was cut off  due to a local emergency, (fed through a pumping system that failed or from contamination) you would have still access to water. You would first have to filter your water into a safe drinkable water. This is where you would buy a really good quality camping or backpacking water filter to remove any bacteria, etc . We have one on hand that we could use worse case scenario.  If you needed water to simply flush your toilets you could use the water as-is.  Most garden stores and big box gardening departments have rain barrels ready made, ours was about $35 several years ago-Screen on lid for filtering out debris, diverter off of downspoutYou can also make your own barrel which we did previously, but is a little trickier. You basically buy a 55 gallon barrel, drill a hole in the bottom and buy the plumbing hardware. I do not advise this, as it's hard to get a good fit. Once you have your rain barrel you need to decide where to put it and it's easy enough to find drop-down diverters to add your gutter downspout. They are paintable to match your house or trim. We have this design-                                                       We added ours during our new gutter installation, a perfect time. You can add them later though, just needs different planning. You basically cut a gap in the downspout to be above your barrel. Screw on the diverter, that's it. We bought a small section of screen to attach with the ring on the barrel. In a freezing climate in the winter it's a good idea to always empty your rain barrel for the winter. We had ours sitting out empty, then last week I adjusted the diverter into the down position to fill up the barrel. After one good rain storm in one day the barrel was 3/4 of the way full! So there is free water out there, some people who set up multiple rain barrels and even very large water catchment systems. Some have above ground, or below-ground, depending on your budget, your needs and preferences. Depends on your climate as well. You may need to check with local ordinances as well, as it varies in some states if you can collect water. I personally believe if water falls on your property you should be able to collect it, but that's another story...Gardening bench ready!Spring Gardening Clean Up Starts-Everything has really started greening up here! Work-wise fruit trees have been pruned, shrubs have been trimmed, mowing has started, and a few things have been rearranged. We had two shrubs that we finally dug up and put in our city compost bin. One was a very large butterfly bush that we loved but about 90% of the shrub was dead, had a very woody base with hardly any live branches left. It was time to simply replace it. Another was a ornamental cherry shrub that was planted near our front door, that just didn't do very well there. When a plant is stressed repeatedly it has a tendency to have bugs/diseases, and the shrub had both consistently. Not enough light in that spot. Ditto it went to the compost tote. I'm a big believer that your front yard, driveway and entryway says a lot about you. You want it clean, tidy, neat, attractive and nicely planted. If your back yard is a pit, at least not one can see it from the street! This doesn't always apply to rural areas where you have much larger acreage to have all your heavy equipment and vehicles out. It's sad for me to see homes becoming an eyesore from lack of care.  We have a large three-story Victorian home in our neighborhood. It's used to be gorgeous, a real gem! Tons of gingerbread, had pretty landscaping-\"before\" photoAfter 10+ years, the paint is peeling off, the house is sinking in spots, and it's just falling apart. I wish someone with a lot of money would buy it and bring it back. It's just sad that people let their homes go for some reason. Sometimes the owners die, become disabled, who knows.Dave and I both take a lot of pride in how our home looks, so a minor re-do of the front yard will fix that! I'm doing some research on what kind of medium sized shrub I can plant in mostly shade near the front door. I think a boxwood may fit the area, maybe.  Dave has added compost to the raised veggie bed in back, with more ready to spread. We bought a new pair of clippers for pruning, our old ones were toast. I scrubbed all of our outside windows last weekend with my handy Windex kit, works great!                                                         You can reach hard to clean areas. I've had mine for years, just buy new pads every year or so. I can see out my windows now! Winter always blows dust and rain, makes a real mess of the windows. Also works great on our backyard glass-topped table. I cleaned/set up, our garden work bench. Great to have everything back in place. We always cover the top in plastic for winter-Next projects are-Taking down the \"sun room\" for the hens, and remove storm window from the bottom. A big screen goes in there. It's been good we've had the sun room up with all the rain! Trimming all the canes of our berries, cleaning out any debris from our perennial beds, fertilizing, and more pruning to come. I'll be starting seeds soon, just hasn't happened yet. Too much weekend time sucked with car repairs, misc stuff. Luckily it's barely April!Steel Cut Oats w/Fruit and Nuts-I've been using some of my steel cuts oats recently. I read about using toppings on the oats and thought why not just mix them in? I decided to soak some oats overnight Saturday night. I used (check online for more info) boiled, hot water, a pinch of salt and the oats. I think I did a 3 to 1 ration, but don't remember where I saw that online, sorry. Just stir in the oats, cover, let sit out overnight. Next morning cook with a little milk added, 1 cup raisins, 1 cup chopped pecans, 1 cup rough chopped home-canned apple slices, and a dash of cinnamon. I cooked about 20 minutes until hot and cooked through. It was wonderful, filling, frugal, healthy and will keep for about 1 week in the fridge. The nice thing is you could really vary this a lot. You could change the nuts, add berries, etc.Aluminum Cans = ArtI snapped this shot at a local grocery store. It was part of a beer display, pretty cute!

I found an old silver plated (?) teapot, $2.00. Top photo, was filthy inside, but two efferdent took care most of that. Then I scrubbed with a soapy bottle brush. It's a bit rusty, so I don't know that I will use it for brewing. Probably holds about 3 cups of tea. Next, I found this pretty glazed egg, $1.50, lovely crazing on the finish-A book/photo holder, $1.50, great for my smaller cookbooks-For spring, a bunny spoon rest $2.00-Bought two new bath hand towels/wash clothes, $5.00 total, new shower curtain liner, $3.00, shower mat $3.00.  Sorry no photos. I bought a nice sized, cheap plastic faux terracotta pot for the back deck, $5. I will probably plant some extra herbs in it since they usually do better in pots. Scored a cute little mini camping-style candle holder, $1.50. Overfilled with wax, but lots of hot water cleaned it up. Perfect for my summer camping vignette-Bought 2 heavy, recycled tire rubber mats for deck pots.  $2.00 each. I will probably hang them on the fence for yard art! All in all, great deals!!!DIY Lawn Thatching-After looking at rentals to thatch our lawn Dave and I decided we might as well buy our own thatching rake. They are a really great tool when you have a relatively small area of turf. Thatch is basically the dried bits of turf/ dead leaves//debris that falls down into your lawn. It can interfere with the absorption of water and fertilizers. In a really hot, dry climate like ours it's good that thatch it periodically. It has a nice wooden handle and very sharp blades. Stores easily, a lot easier than trying to rent a big machine and get it to and from the rental place. For $35 it will certainly pay for itself in  a few years. More to come, got rained out Sunday!Ski Soup for A Wet Day-I was in the mood for some soup this weekend. I made this before, very nice! It's  E-i-e-i-omg Blog  I did modify a bit.  I don't use \"condensed soups\", too much sodium and fillers. I used about 7 cups of organic beef broth, an onion, thyme, garlic powder, some Worcestershire and a bay leaf.  I browned the beef in a little oil, then tossed in the tomato paste. Once coated I put the browned beef in the crock pot. I added the rest of the ingredients and put on high for about 3 hours. Last time I made this I served it with Easy Beer Bread Great stuff, so I made a loaf, beer bread came out super moist-When I was making the soup I got out my homemade clotted cream. Smeared a little on couple of lemon shortbread cookies. OMG, so good!Dark Chocolate Steel Cut Oatmeal Biscuits-I made a double batch of these this weekend and they are wonderful! Not very sweet, chewy with the steel cut oats and moist. Make a double batch because they don't last! Recipe here Dark Chocolate Steel Cut Oatmeal Biscuits. These are great for anytime and keep well. Enjoy!"},
{"title": "DIY Large Fruit Tree Pruning, Homemade Clotted Cream, Shepherd's Pie/Lamb Smell  ", "date": "Mar 18, 2019", "text": "DIY Large Fruit Tree Pruning-Last year when we had our huge maple tree pruned in the backyard, we decided on having the front large apple tree pruned this spring. After looking at it, and seeing what was available locally for rental, Dave and I decided to rent a really tall aluminum orchard ladder. It was 16' high. It's much much taller than our wooden one. We decided to go ahead and take the plunge to have Dave bring the tree height down. He wanted to rent a chainsaw on a long handle. I vetoed that I thought it was just too simply too dangerous to be on a super tall ladder, leaning way out with a motorized saw! We did have a buck saw a couple of different lopping shears and a Sawzall. I reviewed some articles about how to prune fruit trees to refresh my brain cells. Dave watched a few YouTube videos to help him also. So Saturday morning he went and picked up the ladder , I helped him unload it and set it up.Dave bought a hard hat, which was an excellent idea, since he got whacked in the head more than a few times by branches. Good $10 investment! Basically he started on the south side of the tree, which is around this side of our cedar fence in our easement. We both decided about one-third of the tree height would be about good. It is so much easier to do this before the tree leafs out! This is definitely not something for you if you are afraid of heights. I was concerned about Dave being up so close to the top of the ladder, if he fell it would be a long... way... down...I did not leave him alone while he was up there in case he had an accident. I also was able to describe to him what needed to be cut, since a second pair of eyes is always helpful. As the branches started coming down he would either throw them over the fence or they would fall down on their own. I stayed far enough out of the way to not get hit by any falling debris, always a good thing.North side of treeIt took several hours but all in all it came out really well and we saved $250. We also feel educated on how to do this now! Good when you're trying to be more self sufficient. There was the $25 for the rental and the rest were tools we already had. Everything will be cut up and go to the city composting program and they will grind it up for bark dust. We were going to trim the peach tree but really didn't need that big of a ladder, so we were able to get it back under the time frame for the rental easily. Dave and I did trimming of the peach tree later in the afternoon, which went really well.After pictureSince there's an easement to the left we have to keep it cutback more. Sadly county trucks have broken off many branches. Peach tree (with maple tree in back) nicely trimmed. Homemade Clotted Cream-I had plans on making some homemade British Cream Scones for St. Patrick's Day, but came down with a bit of a bug, so I put that on hold. I've been reading a clotted cream for quite a while, never tried any, so I decided to make some! I stumbled on a couple of simple recipes for home making- Theviewfromgreatisland   Basically clotted cream is a British food that is used a lot on scones and other baked goods. Basically you take cream, not ultra pasteurized or it won't clot, and bake it in the oven at a very low temperature for 10-12 hours. Basically sounds like a cultured cream. I set my oven at 170 on Saturday night, took it out of the oven Sunday morning to cool for about an hour. It went in the refrigerator for about 3 hours. At that point it had thickened quite a bit and I was able to scrape off the top. There's some  watery cream mixture left below that can be used as milk in baked goods, etc-Basically the clots that I had were very, very dense and stiff. I had to re-add some of the milk liquid into it, which was messy, but easy. After you mix it together the brown film on the top disappears.I read the flavor really varies on the type of cows that create the cream.  I used organic, free-range whipping cream. One pint made about 1 1/2 cups. Mine has the taste of whipping cream, with a little subtle bit of a different flavor it's hard to describe. It didn't taste sweet, or nutty, but very neutral. It is definitely pure fat! So if you're itching for something really British it's really easy to make! According to what I read it should last several months in the fridge.Shepherd's Pie/Lamb Smell-For St. Pat's Day I decided to make my first lamb Sheperd's pie. I always like to make corned beef and cabbage, but Dave's not a fan. I'll probably make some next weekend after they go on sale. He can have nachos! He he. I couldn't find any ground lamb (waited too long to shop)  so we bought 2 lamb chops. I noticed this odd smell when I opened the package but didn't think much of it. Sadly no one warmed me in the recipes ,about prepping the lamb ahead of time, to avoid the gamey smell! Lesson learned. I've never had that problem with ground lamb. Luckily it was mild outside and I opened the windows. Tons of good info online though to easily avoid this problem in the future. I used a basic recipe, with chopped lamb, onions, peas, carrots and mushrooms. Mashed potatoes go on top. I used a bit too much beef broth in the next photo, so I removed about 1 cup. I topped with unpeeled russet mashed taters. They did sink a bit, but the flavor was wonderful! Broth was amazing with some tomato paste for thickening. I skipped some non-traditional ingredients, like red wine and garlic. Wanted it more simple and traditional. Many use flour for thickening, but I opted for paste. You can really customize this too, some added parsnips, which I would do next time. We have plenty of leftovers and the house smells normal again! Lamb buyer beware!"},
{"title": "Independence Days Challenge", "date": "Mar 11, 2019", "text": "Independence Days Challenge-We've been having getting a little taste of spring the last week. Days are getting longer, now the time change is here. I've seen people out walking their dogs in the evening and I heard lawn mowers roaring. We had some snowflakes on the weekend, but that was okay. So here's the recent rundown-1. Plant Something- Dave and I set up the indoor greenhouse in a spare bedroom this weekend. I'll be planting veggie, flower and herbs this weekend to get a head start. We'll added out new light to our existing mini greenhouse-First I moved all this out, and moved to a closetNice open wallAfter we set up the greenhouse Dave found a scrap piece of conduit and drilled it to attach the light to the greenhouse frameThe conduit fit perfect and popped into he greenhouse frame, with the light screwed onto it   I moved our geranium from the garage into it! Added a timer for 12 hours a dayI wasn't going to bother putting the plastic cover on. Then I saw Anya eyeing the shelves! Better safe than sorry. I also had Dave cut some clear, plastic tarp on top of the carpet, just in case there's leaks. Anya was exhausted from watching!2. Harvest Something-Eggs, lots of them! Chives are up too.3. Preserve/Store Something-Need to make some fermented veggies. This will fix some stomach issues I've had lately, hopefully.4. Manage Reserves- Get a GoodDeal/Barter/Stock Up/Prep-Bought some artisan breads 80% off and froze. Stocked up on our regular things at Costco.5. Eat the Food- Try NewFoods/Recipe-I made some wonderful French baked eggs with our own eggs. I am so loving having 4 hens laying! I gave one of my daughters a dozen fresh eggs last weekend since we had plenty. I don't add extra light (except heat on occasion) during the winter, since I decided to let their production drop naturally. They eat local feed, with lots of extra greens during the winter. I added some dried meal worms recently, since one of the girls is molting. I'll going to thaw out some of our peaches and make a cobbler next weekend. Summer will be here soon, with hopefully more peaches! We sprayed our tree last year with a copper spray to save the tree from peach rust. It should keep it healthy. 6. Build Community Food Systems- Nothing yet, may start selling excess eggs soon. No farmer's markets yet. 7. Recycle/Re-Use- Cleaned out kitchen cupboard and donated a box of misc. mugs, cups, etc. Also cleaned out some crafting supplies. Got a great linen blouse off eBay for $10.00 for summer. Found some craft items that I will sell on eBay as well. I will re-used some potting soil from the potato bins last summer for the seed trays for the inside inside greenhouse. Got some more DVD sets from the library, all free! Dave cleaned out the coop, we sent all the pine shavings to the city for composting-8. Skill Up- Learned about some retirement strategies from a show on PBS. I didn't know about the new HUD program for reverse mortgages. Fascinating. I didn't know there's a lot of flexibility with those programs. I'm not recommending it, just learning. I need to boost my retirement so I don't have to work til I'm 90! I've been re-reading the best way to prune our apple tree, really needs it-Nice article here Modernfarmer.com9. Regenerate What is Lost/SalvageSomething-Dave repaired the roosting bar in the coop after it came undone. Glad he's handy! He also is looking at re-habbing his bicycle so he can start riding again. Not sure if mine is salvageable, pretty heavy for me. We decided to prune the apple tree ourselves and save some $$$."},
{"title": "Not Quite Spring- Chickens, Decor and More, Setting Up An Indoor Greenhouse", "date": "Mar 3, 2019", "text": "Not Quite Spring- Chickens, Decor and More-We have had one snowstorm after another. After another. We had 4\" of snow early last week overnight. It rained the next morning, making for a sloppy commute. Rained the next two days. We finally had some SUN yesterday, with gorgeous deep blue skies and a few puffy clouds-We ran errands, washed our cars, bought some stuff. With the dry weather I was finally able to clean my car windows really well. I can see! With a break in the weather we had planned on Dave cleaning out the coop (I can't clean it with my allergies/asthma). We use the deep litter method so we deep clean the coop once every 3 months. I clean the roosting areas about every day or so. We used to compost all the pine shavings from the deep litter, but our soil level has been raised up so much over the years that we now send it to the city's compost program. We had a coupon for a local feed store and bought two bales of pine shavings so we would have an extra one on hand, as well as a few other things.First we let the chickens out and I let them free range in the backyard while I watched them. It was 45 degrees and nippy but at least the sun was out! They really had a blast getting out into the fresh, wet soil and found tons of worms-RosieAnnieEllie bottoms up! Sarah on the rightFirst Dave used a snow shovel to remove most of the litter and put into our large city compost tote on wheels. Then he went through with a shovel to get the rest, next used a shop vac to get all the shelves and the corners. He started from the top and went down-Hole in the middle goes to the attached sun roomHe did the floor last. He used our mini leaf blower to blast out all the rest. In the warmer weather I would usually put down Diatomaceous Earth at this point. Since it is still so cold it's not really needed. It was 22 this morning! I use that during warmer weather to keep the bugs down. Next he put in all the fresh pine shavings, I deep cleaned the water fount and put the chickens back into the chicken yard. It was a great day to do it! Next month we'll take down the sun room and that will open more space for them outside in the warmer weather.All clean!After I put away my Valentine's Day decor I wasn't quite ready to put out spring items with all the snow on the ground. I don't like to decorate too early. I kind of laugh when I see people who put their Christmas trees up after Halloween or the day after Thanksgiving. I did put our Christmas tree up years ago, the day after Thanksgiving, because I worked full time, had 3 kiddos and we had a four day weekend. Now I like to wait till things are closer. I did have to laugh when I went to Trader Joe's last week and saw Irish soda bread out for St. Patrick's Day. Now that it's March I kind of understand! I bought a loaf to try, delicious, with buttermilk, raisins, and caraway seeds. So here's some of my not quite spring decor that I have out right now-Front entry with some blueFern plaques front entryHomemade lemon topiary on a wood slice are my coffee table Top of my bookcase with some branches with mossSmall entertainment center topMy favorite chicken my daughter gave me!Small live lavender for inside, will plant it outside when it warms upMy dining room shelf with my freshly chalk painted clock and lemonsSetting Up An Indoor Greenhouse-\"Spring\" here can be tough. It can be unusually cold, warm, sleeting, snowing, or dry. We bought a little outdoor greenhouse to start seeds in a couple years ago. We tried it outdoors and it was just too unstable and cold. My plan was to start more from seeds and save money. You can also buy more of a variety of seed to start that you will typically see in nurseries. Boise doesn't have that many nurseries to choose from, so that doesn't help. This winter I thought we could just set it up inside a spare bedroom! I knew we'd need a grow light. We bought this yesterday with our coupon, $15.00-Under counter grow lightWe can attach it with tie wraps to the frame. We'll set it up this week and I'll start planting seeds. I have a nice collection of flowers, herbs, pumpkins and veggies. We're having some family over for a birthday today, so not enough time this weekend. I'll post photos when it's up! Are you ready for Spring? I am!!!"},
{"title": "The BBC's Rosemary & Thyme Series, The Secret Language of Flowers ", "date": "Feb 23, 2019", "text": "The BBC's Rosemary & Thyme Series-After Dave and I went through the Father Brown Mysteries series on Netflix I really wanted to try another BBC series. Years ago I had heard about this series on PBS. The two main characters are avid gardeners out solving mysteries. Rosemary Boxer and Laura Thyme are their names. Rosemary drives a beat up 1980 Range Rover, my kind of gal! She fixes it on the side of the road at one point, that was it for me! Love  it. Laura is an ex-police woman/homemaker and Rosemary is a professor of horticulture. They have quite an adventure when they first meet and then become friends. Our local library had the entire set on DVD so I checked it out. We're both really loving the show, with it's charming characters, amazing gardens they film in. They used some of the most beautiful gardens in the UK and Europe, so what's not to love? The two lead actresses have really great chemistry and it's an easy watch. It aired 2003-2006. Very much inspiring for the upcoming spring gardening season. I've already learned a bit watching the show!!! It has a really lovely musical theme in the intro as well-Recognize the song???Check it out!The Secret Language of Flowers-During an episode of Rosemary and Thyme this custom was mentioned in a fictional book. In that  episode the main character had planted very specific types of flowers in a very specific pattern to communicate something about his lost love. I had heard of this years ago and forgot about it completely! Fascinating!!! Description here-Did you know the type of flowers you give can speak volumes? 'The Secret Language of Flowers' is a fascinating insight into the Victorian tradition of using flowers to convey secret messages, in a society where feelings often had to be suppressed. Samantha Gray reveals how flowers came by their meanings in folklore and how flowers became the language of courtship, love, friendship, beauty, and more. Discover the meanings of over 50 flowers: how lily of the valley symbolizes the return of happiness, how bluebells stand for constancy and everlasting love, and how daffodils represent high regard and chivalry. With stunning illustrations by artist Sarah Perkins that capture all of the beauty of flowers, this is an exceptionally lovely and fascinating gift book."},

{"title": "Thrifted Clock  Swedish Chalk Paint Re-Do, Upcycled Cake Heart = Ivy Topiary", "date": "Feb 17, 2019", "text": "Thrifted Clock Swedish Chalk Paint Re-Do-A week or two ago I blogged about the nice wooden clock that I found at Goodwill for $5.00-When I saw the shape it reminded me of Mora clocks from Sweden with the curvy lines-The clock was made out of nice heavy wood so it was pretty well made. I did a little research and decided to do a light gray chalk paint. I used the same brand that I used for painting the inside of my china cabinet. The color of the paint is called Yesteryear-                                                                 The inside part of the clock that holds the battery and has the face with the hands on the other side was duct taped in. It had four tiny screws, three of which had already snapped off. There was only one screw in place, so I basically gently twisted and the whole piece of plastic was able to come out. First thing I had to do was take it apart and remove the insides since the previous owner had gotten some spray paint on the edges of the glass-I was able to scrape the glass paint off the glass using a razor and then when cleaned the glass. I put a battery in to make sure that it actually worked, which it did! I thought about replacing the clock face with a different color or style. After seeing the way that the battery pack was attached to the front it wouldn't have really been worth the time and effort to try and retrofit it that.I would have liked a white clock face with numbers or Roman numerals, rather than the gold, but I decided to live with it. Sometimes when you're retrofitting something you wind up doing more damage than good if you work on it too much!I used a medium sized craft paint brush and a wide foam brush. The foam brush worked really well for the wide sides since I wanted to minimize brush marks-I gave the clock two coats of chalk paint with letting it dry really well in between coats-After everything dried really well I put a really I put the glass in. I put a really small bead of clear liquid nails on the plastic piece and put it into place. I let all of that dry overnight. I put the back on today and set it up. I think it came out great!  The clock was $5 and the paint was $8.00 at Hobby Lobby, total investment was about $6 since I have lots of paint left over. And I LOVE the gray!Upcycled Cake Heart = Ivy Topiary-When we did our remodeling on our master bathroom I decided to put a plant there. I found a nice terracotta pot that was slightly whitewashed at Goodwill for a couple dollars and planted an ivy in it-I looked around for another plant stake like this one but couldn't find one-Bird stake from a few years agoThe plant has done really well but I wanted to put a heart-shaped topiary frame into the pot. I looked around town but couldn't really find what I was looking for and then I stumbled onto a farm-style rustic cake topper. I found this at Hobby Lobby and suddenly realized I could use it instead-The first thing I did was rub some cooking oil on the bare wood that was going to be going into the soil to protect it. Next I sat down with the ivy and started very carefully untangling the vines. I lost a few leaves during this process but they will grow back as the plant is healthy-After I started winding the ivy around the base and up both sides I realized that there were some loose pieces of the vines. I didn't have any thin wire so I used sewing thread in a dark green. I wound it loosely around the heart and the base. It helps see the heart shape and the base isn't quite so bulky. It came out nice, but I will still keep my eye out for a metal one that would be a little bit bigger. Total cost was $6 for the heart shape."},
{"title": "More Snow, DIY Frugal Fabric Hearts", "date": "Feb 12, 2019", "text": "Snow fallingMore Snow-We did have our forcast snowfall start Friday night, with some of it melting Saturday. More snow came in Saturday night and Sunday we had another inch of fresh snow. Very, very pretty! It melted a bit, then the chickens came out to get some sun and pecked in the muddy dirt. Had a little yesterday, but not much. It was 40 today with rain coming. The mountains have been hit hard, which is good for the water table. Winter is definitely back...Lovely blue skies!DIY Frugal Fabric Hearts-After I recently bought some Prim hearts on Etsy, I was inspired to make some larger ones. Since the basin I have was pretty good-sized I needed more volume. You can see from this photo that I did fill it about halfway with Spanish moss. I got that idea from the photo of the Etsy items that I bought. Her basin was just much smaller. I had some leftover fabrics that I decided to use. I bought some craft stuffing to fill my hearts with. My only purchase was $5.00 for the bag. I used a decorative wall hanging shaped like a heart to be the basic pattern of the two large ones. I had some cream colored burlap that I used first. That was pretty tricky since it's a really loose weave. The first one didn't come out very well shape-wise, so I cut it down smaller. The second one came out better. I had some red and white checked fabric that I decided to make another large heart out of. One of the Pinterest ideas of that I saw was to cut it out stuff it and use pinking shears on the raw edges. So that's what I did!I cut out the heart with plenty of extra fabric, sewed the heart 90% closed, filled and then hand-stitched the rest. I used my pinking shears and carefully went all the way around the heart. I also did the smaller heart the same way. You could do lots of different shapes and sizes but this was enough to go with my basin. You could even use old jeans, sheets any kind of fabric that you have!"},

Between a lot of people donating right at the end of the year, and the Marie Kondo craze, there are lots of things at thrift stores. I did read the original Marie Kondo book a few years ago, which I liked, but I'm not quite that OCD personally. Now that she's on Netflix a lot of people are talking about it at work, etc. The local news even reported donations are way up right now! Win win. Either way it makes for a lot of great items going into the stores. I was running some errands yesterday right by a Goodwill so I went in. I'm working on a project to reorganize some of my small craft supplies. I have craft supplies stuffed in a closet and it all gets mixed together. I wanted to get some plastic totes that were small. I found three of these perfect size and they're clear, $2-Then I found a like-new angel food cake baking tin for $3.00 since mine was falling apart. Now that I have lots of eggs so I can start making angel food cakes again, recipe below. I found the great clock above for $5, it reminded me of the curvy Swedish Mora clocks-Nordicstyle.comIt's 15\" high and is probably considered a mantel-type clock, battery operated. I may paint it, not sure yet but I will definitely do something with the finish. The nice thing is you can open up the entire clock from the back. Someone did a little bit of spray paint on the glass. It's battery operated and will look nice in the house.I also found a fun little wooden Valentine's Day item made out of a 2 x 4, for $2-Perfect for my front entrywayWinter On The Way?The weather has been very mild lately, actually 54 degrees yesterday! Too warm for this time of year but what can you do? I feel so terrible for all the people back in the Midwest and the East Coast who had such terrible blizzards and Sub-Zero temperatures. I've actually been in that kind of weather in the Dakotas and it was awful. I was in an area once where it was 10 below zero, with 50 mile an hour winds. I don't actually know what the windchill was, but it was bad. Yesterday we had the rain set in, rained all day, woke up to pouring rain again this morning-soaked maple tree with Poesy the neighbor kittySun is out a bit this afternoon. More in the forecast, then the temperature will drop and go into a rain/snow mix. Hard to tell if it will actually snow here in the valley, but it's really great news to get a lot more snow up in the mountains. We always need that for a water table and snow pack!!!Grungy Valentine's DayI was looking on Etsy a few weeks ago to try to find something interesting for Valentine's Day that was affordable. I found this little set of handmade fabric primitive items at Etsy.com.  I really love them! They also inspired me to make something of my own along these lines, but larger. Since I have a larger white enameled basin on my coffee table I needed some bigger ones. The basin above is smaller than mine. I have some red and white checked cotton fabric and some cream colored burlap. This week I'm going to cut out some larger hearts, stuff them and put them in the basin with the ones I bought. Photos coming! For $5 at Joann's Fabric I bought a bag of crafter's poly fill which should do the trick-So basically this will be free craft items out of my recycled fabrics. At Joann's I also found some fun herb stakes! When I tell Dave to go out on the deck and bring me in a hand of thyme he always has to ask me which is which? These should solve that problem, about 6\" across. I am going to polyurethane these to make them more weather resistant, $3 each-And my back-ordered mini-wind vane finally arrived! It was back east stuck in the blizzards-Love it!Citrus Angel Cake-I finally had enough eggs to make this, and a new thrifted pan! The link I had is dead so here's the recipe-Makes: 12 servings, Prep: 30 minutes, Bake: 40 minutesIngredients:      Nancy Note- I added 1/2 teaspoon pure orange extract, since I like a more intense flavor. And I only sifted the flour and sugar once, since it's pre-sifted. Came out great!1 1/2  cups egg whites (10 to 12)1 1/2  cups sifted powdered sugar1  cup sifted cake flour or sifted all-purpose flour1  teaspoon cream of tartar3  tablespoons frozen juice concentrate (limeade, lemonade, or orange juice), thawed3/4  cup granulated sugarDirections- In a covered large bowl, let egg whites stand at room temperature for 30 minutes. Sift the powdered sugar and flour together three times; set aside. Preheat oven to 350°F.Add cream of tartar to egg whites in bowl; beat with an electric mixer on medium speed until soft peaks form (tips curl). Add juice concentrate. Gradually add granulated sugar, about 2 tablespoons at a time, beating until stiff peaks form (tips stand straight).Sift about one-fourth of the flour mixture over beaten egg white mixture; fold in gently. (If the bowl is too full, transfer mixture to a larger bowl.) Repeat, folding in the remaining flour mixture by fourths. Pour batter into an ungreased 10-inch tube pan; spread evenly. Bake on the lowest oven rack for 40 to 45 minutes or until the top springs back when lightly touched. Immediately invert cake (leave in pan); cool thoroughly. (If the cake has risen higher than the pan, invert it over a jar or bottle so the top of the cake does not touch the counter top.) To serve, loosen side and center from pan with a narrow spatula; remove cake. Using a serrated knife, cut into wedges. You could add a glaze if you like!"},

We didn't realize our dishwasher was actually about 12 years old! We had noticed more food was getting into the sprayer arms over the last year or so. We would clean them out and they would just clog again. We were really cleaning the dishes ahead of time too. A few nights last week we walked in and found water on the floor in front of the dishwasher. After doing some research, and asking about a local repair shop, it was past that point of no return. I have joked with Dave that if he passes away first I would ditch the dishwasher. I'd have a carpenter put in some really nice light colored shelves, something like this, no link back on Pinterest sadly-We decided to join Consumer Reports online for $7 a month. It's a great way to do a lot of research if you're going to make a major purchase. You can just cancel your subscription after the one month. We didn't know much about newer dishwashers and how energy-efficient they are! You can run a 1/2 load and use very little water and power. That's great since we were running ours every other day. They newer ones have light sensors in them that can read how dirty the water is at the start of the cycle. It then adjusts the water and length of the cycle. Amazing!We looked at three different big box stores online and then went to a local furniture place that also sells appliances. Years ago I had seen Bosch dishwashers but they were really, really expensive since they were imported from Germany. I didn't know that at some point they started manufacturing them in the U.S.! The short version- after doing a lot of price checking, checking features and reliability was we bought a Bosch dishwasher. We also got free no interest financing for 12 months. We will just pay a little each month and then be done. We brought home the dishwasher (in stock too!)  yesterday and Dave installed it in two hours-Anya approvedTons of sound insulation!!!We ran it this morning and it's incredibly quiet which is a bonus. I was so used to the loud noises that I kept thinking the new one wasn't on, ha ha. I did have my dishwasher cover on the old dishwasher, but the magnetic part won't stick on the new one bummer...All in all the installation only took a couple of hours, we bought from a local store which supported them, made in the USA and got a great price, $485.00. Win win! Big box stores DON'T always have the best prices and NOTHING in stock. So remember to shop around!!!Bye Bye Winter Decor-In some ways I'm just not ready to say goodbye to Winter yet! I just love snow and we haven't had hardly any this year. I know that may sound crazy if you live back east with blizzards in 20 degree below weather. But in the high desert that we live in here snow is a rarity, usually. I decided to go ahead and pack up all the winter decor yesterday and it's all back out in the garage. I had deep cleaned our barn wood living room bookcase and lightened it up. I added some lighter Swedish Ivy and the new topiary I made. I also added a few Valentine's Day things around the house even though it's not quite February, but it will be next weekend!My sweet daughter Tami gifted me with a chicken from Cost Plus, love it!Fave thrifted vaseWhen I was outside this morning I was really shocked to see some green things coming up in the front yard!Asian PoppyLamb's EarMisc ground coverShasta DaisiesBulbsI know we've been having mild weather, but this was kind of crazy in January. I hope we don't have any really hard freezes anytime soon. We have another mild week this week in the forecast, upper 40's. It always makes me really nervous when the perennials come up too early because February and March can still have bitter bitter cold weather. We've actually had a relatively mild winter, although we did have some very cold temperatures in November. While I love spring and seeing everything green up, it's always a dangerous kind of time if it happens too early. Time will tell...Roasted Pork Tenderloin & Potsticker Salad-I decided to buy a couple of pork tenderloin roasts after I saw an amazing price for two at Costco! I froze one for later. I wasn't sure about the best way to roast one so I tried recipe hereLecremedelacrumb.com . Since I don't buy pre-packaged Italian spice mix I just used basil, oregano and thyme. It came out super tender and juicy- I was also I decided to make it my favorite pot sticker salad I hadn't made it quite while. I used chicken and vegetable pot stickers, also from Costco, and followed this recipe for the dressing and salad Sunset.com The dressing really makes this dish, with the fresh lemon juice adding the tang."},
{"title": "Crazy Weather and Cobbler, Nice Freebies and Finds! ", "date": "Jan 19, 2019", "text": "Crazy Weather And Cobbler-I woke up this morning to a soaked yard and fences. We have had just really crazy weather lately! We had a little bit of snow a few days ago, that melted and turned to just dry weather. Next we had almost 50 degree weather for 2 days. Last night a big rain storm blew in, with more rain in the forecast, but mild. The good news is there should be quite a bit of snow up in the mountains which we really need. The hens are really producing, with more than 2 dozen eggs in the fridge! Giving some to my daughter today. The chickens are glad the sun room is up. It's a nice dry space for them during the wetter weather. They take dust baths, hang out and chat about whatever chickens chat about. We haven't had a many big winter storms blowing in so far. That's never good for upcoming fire season. I will probably bring in my to let it snow signs this weekend since I don't think it's going to happen! I'll be putting away our winter decor next weekend, and get ready for Valentine's Day. It's just around the corner which always seems to get me ready for Spring. I guess it's just the bright red? What's the weather doing where you are? With the cold, wet weather (45 today) I decided to use some of my home grown, home canned apples and make Nancy's appleblueberry cobbler -Nice Finds!Here's a few great deals, and freebies, I've gotten lately! I had noticed the Subaru seemed to have some squeaking gone on in the engine, like a slipping belt. I mentioned it to Dave a few times and he told me he didn't hear anything. Our son-in-law listened and confirmed my squeak. At the dealership it turned out the was a \"service bulletin\" out for the belt. They installed a new one for free and now no drama down the road. Score! It's not a \"recall\", but close enough. I wish they would inform people of service bulletins. I can only guess it's too much trouble and they would be giving away a lot of service time and parts.I recently found a new (to me) British series on Netflix on gardening in small spaces - Big Dreams, Small Spaces We still have some odd areas on the lot that are hard to garden on, lack of sun, etc. I'm hoping this will give me some ideas, since Spring is around the corner! Some of the ideas are for planting edibles, so curious to get ideas for that too.Next when I purged a lot of my clothes I found a new pair of jeans I had altered. They were still a little too big thru the waist. I had taken them in, but not enough, and had sat them aside. They got buried in the closet. Still too big but I fired up the sewing machine and all fixed!I bought more faux Swedish ivy online that I couldn't find locally, and found this, a Victorian Chicken Plate-It's heavy and very textured if you see the photo above. Just gorgeous. About 12\" x 12\". It's now hanging in my dining room \"window\".                                                         We did a mini road trip to our favorite little diner two weekends ago. It had been sold and all the cool vintage collections were gone-Loved the green painted handles! Cool green Australian (owner told me) pie safeFood was still great, but kind of sad about the decor. The space was more open, less cluttered and the theme they went with was mountain decor-I really liked the fish, canoe, tree and duck!I asked the waitress where they got some of their things and she told me all kinds of places and LTD.com  I had never heard of them, but Dave had. It's like Amazon on steroids for decor, etc. Great prices, relatively speaking as well. I decided I could buy a few NEW things for a change. (FYI, just sharing my finds, no fees being paid.) On the first page of the online catalog I saw a small goat figure !!! Swoon! I always wanted real goats, but have to go with the fake ones. I bought two figures, shipped and on their way, they also have cows, sheep and pigs!Nice finishI like table runners, not a table cloth or place mat fan. Runner are easy to wash and rotate. I found this chicken themed 72\" table runner, $6.00, bought 2 matching towels, so cute! Perfect for some red for Valentine's day and summer-And another chicken item, small mini windvane, $9.00, (what can I say I love chicken stuff). I may polyurethane this and put it outside, not sure yet-I got 2 things for Christmas for next time, great after holiday sales, a 60\" x 102\" fabric tablecloth, big enough for our dining table with the leaf in, $10.00. I can use it for our big family get-togethers and use into January too- I LOVE this reindeer, it came yesterday, soft and sweet, $14.00.The antlers light up, or you could leave them off. Very soft fabric and the legs unscrew for easy storage. It looks even better in person! I may sew a button on the nose...A while back I got a small sample glass cleaning cloth at Ace Hardware. It's fabric, uses no chemicals just water and it did a great job! Worked on the computer monitors, windows, TV. Just wet, wring out and use. Dry as needed. It's scent-free and should last quite a while, 2 pack here-"},
{"title": "Independence Days Challenge", "date": "Jan 8, 2019", "text": "Independence Days Challenge-For a variety of reasons I decided not to do the \"year in review\" post. It's labor intensive, although educational for me. We didn't do any huge home improvements, more little things. We will do a major front yard re-do next spring. The county is widening our front street in December and we will dig up as much as we can this fall to relocate until spring. We're losing about 2' - 3' of our front yard  garden. Luckily since most are perennials they should be okay. So here's a list of recent things we've been up to! I watched a few episodes of Marie Kondo's Netflix series. It inspired me to get rid of more stuff. She's the author of She really does have some great ideas especially around \"sentimental items\".  So here we go...1. Plant Something- Frozen ground here, nope!2. Harvest Something- Lots of eggs, happy dance!!! Averaging about 2-4 per day. Hens are doing great this winter, with the \"sun room\" up-Sarah left and Ellie rightRosie left, Annie right, her head was on the ground for bird food!3. Preserve/Store Something- Have been freezing various foods/breads/etc.  Need to make some fermented foods soon.4. Manage Reserves- Get a GoodDeal/Barter/Stock Up/Prep- Have been using some coupons for wild bird food, bought some meats on sale, doing flexible cooking based on availability. Buying groceries with a open mind is a great way to save money. Look and see what's a great deal and cook around that. I got a great deal on chicken quarters so I bought those instead of breasts w/ribs. Roasted those with some homemade pesto from the freezer-Got this fun farm item from a store going out of business, $5.00, I think I'll do a little dry brush paint on it...5. Eat the Food- Try NewFoods/Recipe- Will get into freezer more and do some baking with frozen fruits. Have homegrown tomatoes, local peaches, rhubarb and organic blueberries/strawberries. Also need to work on my own canned apple slices-6. Build Community Food Systems- Had a co-worker inquire about buying extra eggs, so will talk to her about that soon. I used to sell my extra eggs for $3.00 dz. May have to boost that?7. Recycle/Re-Use- Donating a bit of my \"work wardrobe\" and other clothes this week. Total- four garbage bags. I changed jobs from an office setting with patients to a setting where everyone wears jeans, no public in-person interactions. I bought two new pair of jeans this weekend as mine were a bit too ratty for work. Great for around the house (thrifted) but needed some actual NEW ones! Got a good deal locally. Fun reminder on good aspects of de-cluttering/donating-Keyboard at work too small for me so taking an old one from here to work. Free fix. I cleaned out 2 of my kitchen desk \"junk\" drawer of misc. stuff for donations and trash-BeforeAfterBeforeAfterAnya reused some hot air coming out of the space heater-8. Skill Up- Bought some heavy denim needles for my sewing machine. Since it's a \"heavy duty\" machine I forgot to add needles to the equation. Duh. Broken needles and a tune-up later, lesson learned. 9. Regenerate What is Lost/SalvageSomething- Dave built the new coop ramp on the left as the other one was falling apart, used recycled cedar boards-"},

Here's some things I put together, with a wood slice from Michael's for $10.00-Topiary and Swedish ivyLittle oil lampRed pips and birds I added this to my little winter bench, using a thicker slice for $5.00, adding more texture-If you need something different go buy a slice and play with it!!! I can see all kinds of possibilities using what I already have!Winter Indoors After the Holidays-I'm hoping for real snow tonite!!! Storm on the way, sick of the brown frozen city. Snow please. I always start in early December putting out fun winter decor. My daughter gave me a nice compliment recently. She said \"you always do a great job bringing nature inside\". I loved it! I start with winter, my Yule shelf and the Advent ring. Closer to mid December I add Santa's and the Christmas tree. Around New Years we take down the tree and the rest of Christmas stuff.

{"title": "DIY Lemon Topiary, Cubicle Reveal", "date": "Jan 5, 2019", "text": "DIY Lemon Topiary-It was 18 degrees and gray this morning, yuck! A snow storm on the way tonite, but sounds like it will probably hit the foothills and mountains more. I love the snow, sure beats the look of the cold frozen brown ground! Driving is not that hard, when you take your time. With that grayness in mind I was thinking I should add some pops of yellow to the house in the winter. I already had a few things in the house, as well as for my new desk area at work. I had made this fun topiary a few years ago and decided to make another-I used the blue pot I already had, post here Lemon Topiary  with directions here Astrollthrulife.net  I did use hot glue on the twigs however, not wire. You could use any kind of pot, but last summer I bought two of these Ikea metal pots-I used the larger one for this little tree-When I put away the tree I thought I could re-use it for a topiary! Easy enough to remove the insides later if I wanted to. I did the same basic directions, took about 15 minutes. I already had everything except the lemons, $5.00 at Michael's. Fun thing to do when you need a little change!I decided to use the mini-lemon garland I bought for work at home-I put them on my little kitchen shelf-They looked like this when I bought them-I removed the \"limes\" and re-strung this since they were an odd brown color. I bought them at Factorydirectcraft.com I first saw them here, and fell in love, in this blog post-From Hazeleyessue.blogspot.comI loved the way she created a little tea shelf/area. I also bought the little Scottish Tea Time Recipes book. The mini-lemon garland was one of those little things I really liked, but couldn't find. A few years later I found them! Happy dance. More yellow to come, thinking about a lemon wreath on our front door in the summer...Cubicle Reveal-Speaking of yellow,  the cubical decor is more minimal than I was thinking I'd do, but I like it! I printed/framed the little sign and hung the mini wreath.Lavender in the corner (I may move) and yellow appreciation gift from my former boss. I decided to use the little plant stool at home-It's odd I have no papers for the rack! I'm working in an almost 100% digital environment. I may see if I can just remove the shelf and store. It's funny, I found out there are rules as to how much you can put up on your desk. Apparently there may have been a few people who really overdid it in this area. Anyway I like it and can add some seasonal things over time to swap out. I LOVE my sit/stand station! Nice to be able to stand up at work..."},

{"title": "Resting Thru The Holidays, Changing Times Gives Meaning, Cubicle Decor Ideas", "date": "Dec 31, 2018", "text": "Resting Thru The Holidays-Both Dave and I wound up sick through the holidays. Could have been much worse since we weren't traveling. A few days before Christmas weekend Dave came down with influenza A, fever, chills, terrible cough. I took him to urgent care and they got them fixed up with some Tami flu and a prescription cough suppressant capsule. That stuff is amazing! Once he started sleeping through the night, and on the Tamiflu, he felt much better pretty quickly. His cough is almost gone. Two days later I came down with a Wheezy bronchitis coupled with my asthma is not a good combo. But I got some medication within a couple of days and I'm feeling better and finally sleeping. Not being able to sleep at night because of wheezing is never fun. The good thing was we both had a four-day weekend and I took a lot of naps. I watch Netflix, rested and did as little as possible to get over it quicker. Sadly I started my new job the day after Christmas sick, but I had to go and it was just one of those things. So all-in-all we're feeling better and we're lucky that we were home and able to rest and didn't have any huge commitments. Had a little snow here and there-Changing Times Gives Meaning-I didn't know how to title this and maybe it'll make sense I hope. I'm so burnt out with seeing all the shopping days till Christmas, all the sales all the emphasis on buying lots of stuff for other people. We did that when our kids were little sadly, but times change. We now have three adult children and two of them have their own children. After they became adults we did a gift exchange where you just buy one gift for one person and it really took the financial burden off our girls. When the two babies arrived they decided they didn't want to do that either. That was fine and it really has put the focus more on spending time together as a family and just enjoying each other's company. Having a meal together and being able to talk is a rarity since we're all on different schedules with two of my girls working weekends off and on. It's fun babysitting but it's nice to see your adult kids as well! So taking away the whole gift-giving part has really put more than meaning onto spending time together as a family. Dave and exchanged some simple gifts, a new flannel shirt for him and a book. He got me a wireless keyboard/mouse to tidy up my kitchen computer desk area, a splurge! I love it!!!!  I still like to bake for the holidays although I didn't do nearly as much as year since I was sick. I may make some British Cream Scones tomorrow for New Years since I'm in a baking mood now! They're really amazing and good for whatever ails you-Dave and I started watching the Father Brown Mysteries show on Netflix and I love watching with all these English homes circa 1950 with all their tea accessories. Lots of scones on the show as well as tea cookies, etc. I'd love to go to the UK someday! Speaking of British...Cubicle Decor Ideas-One of the fun things about moving into my new job was having a little bit more room to decorate and personalize! When I first worked for my corporation I was in a very, very small triangular shaped cubicle with very little room. Then I moved into a clinic for almost 2 years I had a little bit of room but not a whole lot more. Now I've moved into a brand new, rehabbed state-of-the-art office. It used to be a global engineering firm and I'm on the 7th floor with a spectacular 360-degree view of the city from all sides. When they acquired the older series of buildings they completely remodeled the insides of the office/hall areas. Everything is brand new. I have a beige counter top and small drawer.  I have a really nice pretty deep blue background to decorate on the soft board area. After looking at it I realized that yellow would be a really nice kind of accent color to just brighten it up a little bit. First I re-used a thrifted frame and printed my free yellow Keep Calm sign above! Here's a few things I'm  using, including a wall calendar, I'm old school!From Costco, bought for the house, but took to workBought a mini lemon garland for the house, going to work insteadMini plant stand from Hobby Lobby, $8.00Faux lavender also Hobby Lobby, $4.00 Mini wreath, $1.50 Hobby LobbyName cubes my 1st manager made for all of her teamHere's my desk- love the blue!I may remove the hanging rack, we use very little paper! I don't have everything up yet since we worked a short day today and were dismissed early for New Year's Eve.

I'm feeling much better this afternoon, cough mostly gone. We're having Christmas Day here, then dinner at one of my daughters. Starting a new job Wednesday with my same company, will be nice change I think. Did some baking today, listened to holiday tunes, and took a nap. Not bad all in all!

My Little Swedish Corner", "date": "Dec 16, 2018", "text": "Time for some TLC, rescued reindeerUpdate and Reindeer In Our Garage! It's been a really crazy last week with lots of holiday and birthday stuff going on. Weather has been really mild, 40's today, snow pretty much melted. Christmas baking will be next weekend. I have to pace myself! All my girls do their own baking, so I just do a couple small batches for us and ones the girls don't make. We stopped doing our family gift exchanges when our girls asked us to stop. It was just too much expense with two new babies. We still do stockings but keep it minimal. For us it's more about the time spent together and less about \"stuff\". The chickens are laying like crazy, 3-4 eggs every day. What a change from no eggs! I'm giving excess to the kids. Friday I had holiday lunch party/Santa gift exchange at work which was really fun. We all bought gifts for each other and we had a really nice lunch that one of the doctors paid for. Friday night my husband's company paid for a really nice dinner out at a local Brazilian Grill called Tucano's-The salad bar extends to the right another 50 feet, on both sides!It's a theme kind of restaurant, not my thing, but it was fun and it certainly had lots of different foods for everybody. They have a massive salad bar that's monstrous with things that you don't usually see in salad bars, like quail eggs. They bring around huge skewers of all different kinds of meat and slice it on your plate. A fun time was had by all and Dave and I got to spend time visiting with some of his co-workers and just relaxing. I did have a bit of an upset tummy yesterday, but some ginger ale and tums took care of that. Maybe a little bit too much rich food? We were gifted with snowman mug with a candle holder from our table-Last night was my daughter Michelle's birthday and we had a get-together at her house. She asked me to make a specific cake Epicurious Double Chocolate Layer Cake  It has buttermilk and was really delicious! I also made a homemade butter cream frosting that is cooked with egg yolks and has cardamom (sorry no photos). I couldn't find the frosting recipe online since I printed it several years ago. Makes for an unusual flavor since cardamom doesn't taste like anything else. We had a great time there last night but we're really tired at the end of the day. Today is also grandson Oliver's 2nd birthday, another party late today. We found a really fun book for him, a classic. Shhh, can't share here. We did get our Christmas tree up yesterday and are decorating it today. And speaking of Christmas...  I found this cute little guy at Lowe's!Spice tinIt's funny that I have found some really unique items at Lowe's, of all places. I found Nordic inspired knit balls and Tomtens (trolls). A big box store and really inexpensive!My carIt's funny having so many reindeer in our garage! Last year at the grocery outlet I found a little reindeer kit really cheap. The antlers go on the back windows and the nose goes on the front and I drive around with a smile on my face. I've seen these around town which is where I got the idea. Just a little fun something that cost me a couple of bucks. AntlerDave's boss was throwing the two reindeer top photo in the trash and he snagged them, I'll repair the ears and clean them up. Pretty cute! They just need some love, then we'll put them outside.My Little Swedish Corner-After I painted my Ikea step stool with the blanket stripes I found the perfect corner for it. Out of the way when we don't need it. I had bought a small fake tree at Michael's and it fit perfect into my little rustic enameled Ikea steel pot. I put it on top of the step stool, but it needed a little something. When I unpacked my Yule items I found two little Tomtens/gnomes that fit perfect there! I think of it as my little Swedish corner. I need to have my DNA tested someday, I think I'm probably at least part Scandinavian!"},
{"title": "Low Cost Ways To Keep Your Home Warm In The Winter !!! Safer DIY Advent Candle Upgrade, Easy Upcycled Wood Ornaments & Winter Decor", "date": "Dec 9, 2018", "text": "Anya likes to stay warm too!Low Cost Ways To Keep Your Home Warm-Winter is here, with more snow on the way! Most of the last storm a week or so ago is gone in back-If you live in a cold winter climate too you know it can get chilly inside. Here's some tips and tricks I've learned over the years, many of them low cost...My first suggestion- insulate your windows! Whether you want to buy insulated curtains, or make your own, it makes a huge difference. Some people have used fleece or even blankets. Over the years I slowly bought insulated curtains for our living room, dining room and 2 bedrooms. They made a huge difference!rubberized coating over heavy cottonThey last forever and go thru the washer easily. I just wash and hang up damp on the rod to dry. They also keep your home cooler in the summer. Similar ones here if you can't find them locally and they come in many styles, sizes and colors-                                                         Caulk your windows periodically. We added new windows 12 years ago. This last summer Dave was hosing down a window and some water came inside! Time to re-caulk. He bought clear, paintable exterior caulk. He did all the windows and doors. It tightens the house up and caulk is cheap.If you have floor vents invest in some heavy plastic diverters. Having hot air blow up inside your curtains against cold glass is wasteful. Ditto going under furniture. You want the air in the room. Ours were about $3.00 each at a big box store and they have heavy magnets to keep in place-                Use a small heater for small spaces. Our kitchen tends to be colder with sliding glass doors. I use a space heater to warm up just that room. I only turn it on when I'm in the room, and much cheaper than heating the whole house-(string is kitty toy) You can also add something fuzzy to chairs/couches in colder rooms, like a fleece blanket, or an faux sheepskin (Ikea), like Anya's above. We keep cozy blankets on the couch in the living room as well.Close/reduce vents in areas you don't need to heat all the time. I closed the vent right by the front door, since it's in a hall. With people going in and out, it's just heat loss.Keep a clean furnace filter in your furnace. It will pay for itself in efficiency. Get a tuneup if needed. Our furnace in our last house DIED on Christmas Eve in 10 degree weather. That was a very expensive holiday. Now we stay on top of things.Dress for the weather! Don't wear shorts and tee shirts inside when it 14 degrees outside. You'd be surprised how many people I see who do this!Whenever you bake/have the oven going prop the door open when it's done and let the heat out.Drink lots of hot beverages, that will make you feel warmer.Invest in a warm comforter! Prices have come way down on synthetics over the years and they last for years and years. I bought ours at Ross, a discount store, about 7 years ago and it still going strong. I just wash it once or twice a year and store it off season in spare closet. Down is another option. Duvet covers can be easily washed/updated as needed. Also buy flannel sheets, much warmer than regular cotton-Our comforter and flannel sheetsBuy some warm pajamas! When it's really cold you don't want to be sleeping in a thin t-shirt, etc. I sleep in polar fleece pajama bottoms and long sleeve t-shirt. There are more ideas online if you want to stay warm and save some $$$!Safer DIY Advent Candle Upgrade-Our Advent candle ring I bought for Dave a few years ago needed some love. I bought a ready-made one off-season at a great price. I added berries, pine cones and apples. The apples had developed a cracked finish after all the years -Excess wax accumulated from candles as well. I added apples because we both love the song Jesus Christ The Apple Tree. Over the years I started thinking the candles weren't that safe. Last year I bought 4 new LED taper candles, 75% off, and stored them. First I unscrewed the bases-I painted them the same colors as the wax ones we used. I painted each one of the tapers very carefully, mixing my own colors-I used what I already had!We use 3 purple and 1 pink, but the tradition varies on colors. I removed the old apples carefully, then hot glued some extra thrifted red apples I had-I cleaned off the excess wax as best I could, and bought some paint for a second coat. So far we love it! Updated and much safer!Easy Upcycled Wood Ornaments & Winter Decor-I putt out my winter decor, we'll do the Christmas tree, Santa's next weekend. When I picked up a few holiday items at Michael's I stumbled onto some white wooden pieces. I immediately thought of Swedish decor with the hearts and birds. I thought I could drill some really tiny holes and turn them into ornaments! I could either put them on our Christmas tree or add them to some of the greenery around the house for something fun and different. So for $0.99 each I bought three birds and three hearts. Basically they're white painted plywood with slightly distressed edges. It's funny that I've always loved old things and somehow they have become \"vintage\". Anyway I showed them to Dave and he did have a nice small drill bit. So he drilled a hole centered on each piece, then I used Baker's Twine for a little loop to hang them from-Baker's Twine is awesome stuff if you're not familiar with it! You wrap foods with it, but you can also use it for all kinds of winter crafts-Simple Ball jar with a bow and candle                                                           And now for some more winter decor here! We don't like to rush into Christmas and the holidays, so here's a peek at some other fun things, this one red and white! My old enamel basin, with a large silvered bird, Nordic knit balls, apples, pinecones and faux snowballs. It's nice on my red and white table runner in our living room-My fave Yule shelf I always set up in the dining room-Dining room table area, will add some Christmas goodies next week to replace the large print-Kitchen window-New star shaped LED lights, cozy! Kitchen counter-By my kitchen desk-Snowmen of course! I leave my winter things up thru mid January or so for fun- entryway  New thrifted topiaries with small lights and birds-I added a little something in the herb box on the deck-Dave spent a better part of the cold day putting up exterior lights, etc. Looks very festive coming home from work in the dark!!!"},

I also made more donations. I found these 2 heavy ceramic topiaries, $5.00 each! What a find, very nice!!!Base, heavy planterI knew these would work great on my entertainment center shelf and I can decorate seasonally. Easy to move around as well. I added these lights (didn't fuss much) love them! The large ceramic bird below was $3.00, also very French Country!I found this made-in-France Pyrex baking set, only $5.00! I never knew they made glassware there!  I saw this cute galvanized Autumn metal sign for $3.00 at a local grocery store, will save for next year- First Snow Coming- We have our first snow on the way, very cold and rainy yesterday. I put out a lot of bird food right after work. The birds really came to feed! Doves, squirrels and finches-We did get snow in the foothills and I'm ready to pt up some winter decor this weekend. Christmas decor will come next. I'm ready for snow!!! Egg Competition?One of our young hens first started laying, then #2. Now we're getting 3 per day. **Update- we got 4 eggs today! All are laying. Is this a competition or what? Maybe their hormones all kicked it at once? We LOVE having fresh eggs again. It's a real part of our urban homesteading, producing our own foods. The hens eat bugs, weeds and fertilize. And lay eggs. Win win.Mine coming soon!New Job = Decorating Fun!After a long, thoughtful process I decided to transfer into another job in my company. I just wanted something simpler, and with more room for growth. I will have a cubicle about the same size as the one above. It will be fun to personalize my space more! I'll have a sit/stand station, a real bonus. Much easier on my back. More soon, doing lots of research on Pinterest! I'm looking forward to the move, new things to learn."},
{"title": "Fresh Eggs, Sunroom & The First Winter Storm, Thanksgiving & Family, Blog Re-Vamp", "date": "Nov 23, 2018", "text": "Fresh Eggs, Sunroom & The First Winter Storm-Unlike some people I was really thrilled last night when I heard some really strong gusting winds hit the windows and heard the rain! It is been so long since we've had any rain, probably a couple months. We really don't get summer storms that produce any rain anymore. 20+ years ago, when we first moved to the Boise area, we would pretty regularly get some summer storms with thunder, lightning, and heavy rain. Those days seem to be over. This morning when we woke up there were lots of leaves on the ground and everything was really wet, perfect. Air smells great and there's still more rain headed this way today. David cleaned out our gutters a few days ago knowing the storm was coming in. It's so much easier to do in the leaves are dry in the gutters! Our maple tree still has quite a few leaves, but that's just the way it goes. Every year.Sunroom on leftDave decided to put the coop sun room up Wednesday since he had that day off work. We were both off work all week on vacation, a nice treat! Dave created this sun room for the girls years ago after I saw something similar online. We salvaged lumber, and bought some really cheap, used shower doors. Dave then built a frame for it and made it removable, so we can store it when spring comes. The chicken started exploring it as soon as he had it up. n space and they were taking dust baths yesterday. It just gives some extra room for the birds if the weather gets really bad. Ironically two winters ago when we had Snowmageddon 2017 we had decided not to put it up, go figure. That winter turned out to be the heaviest snow on record, or close to it, in the Boise area ever-It's been really fun collecting eggs again! We've been getting one small egg everyday and I'm not sure if it's from one chicken or both of the younger ones? They're a little smaller so I suspect they're not from our two older hens. The really nice thing about having younger hens is that you know you'll have several years worth of fresh eggs. While the older hens are doing pretty well, they stopped playing when they went thru their Autumn molt. I suspect they will probably start laying again but time will tell.With the colder weather I brought out my faux sheepskin chair cover from Ikea last summer, nice and toasty! My back always gets cold sitting next to the glass in the dining area-The morning afterThanksgiving & Family-We had a really great time yesterday for Thanksgiving, and we hosted. I provided the following (sorry no photos)- the 22 Lb. turkey, Yukon Gold mashed potatoes, gravy, dressing, homemade cranberry sauce (Emeril's), Indian pudding and a Flourless Chocolate Almond Cake.  Since Dave can't really eat dairy anymore I wanted to have a dessert that he would enjoy. My one daughter brought a pumpkin cheesecake and I made Indian Pudding, both with dairy. The chocolate almond tart was a big hit with everybody! I could go the rest of my life without ever eating another pumpkin pie anything. I'm just not a fan. Between an apple pastry my daughter brought, a berry pie, pumpkin cheesecake and the chocolate tart there were just desserts galore! I must say I really miss having a separate dining room that we had at our last house.Dining table needs to be put back togetherOur current house is smaller and has one space for the kitchen/dining area. With the table leaf we can seat 6 and you can squeeze in 8 if you need to. We also had a card table set-up that works next to that. It was a tight squeeze but we all had a good time and lots of great food and that's all that matters. We also had an unexpected guest which was fine, someone was at their families house and wanted to drop over. I'm a big believer in the idea that a house full of love has elastic walls. Ironically I had roasted an extra turkey breast for plenty of leftovers.The next day or two and I will clean off the carcass to make turkey soup.We don't watch football here, play computer games, we just talk and it's really nice to have just family. Someone in our family has gone to other Thanksgivings elsewhere and said there were just way too many people, friends, neighbors etc. They missed just having family time to just hang out. That's the way we like it! I hope you had a great one!Blog Re-VampYou'll be seeing some changes on the layout of my blog soon. You may have already noticed a few? I'm eliminating a lot of the Amazon links on the left side bar since it wasn't really generating much income. For whatever reason people just weren't looking at various items. The reality is that I found I earned more money as a Hometalk featured blogger in two months than I did in the last year or so with Amazon, so I'm concentrating on that. My total out of all the years I have been blogging has been less than $120.00 or so. While I don't mind working for free I would actually like this blog to generate some income at some point. Time will tell, but you'll see some changes. I still may have specific items in specific posts with a link, but many of the other generic links will go away. Everything else is still there, just maybe on the other side of the blog."},

{"title": "Anniversary Road Trip, Winter Is Here!", "date": "Nov 19, 2018", "text": "Anniversary Road Trip-Last year we went to the mountain resort of McCall, Idaho for an overnight trip for anniversary. We enjoyed it so much that we decided to go back this year for our 25th! We drove up Saturday morning and spent the night, came back Sunday afternoon. We stayed a nice little hotel that's right near the lake, which has a nice 5 Star restaurant next door. Weather was great, it was clear and sunny but cold. The room was nice and spacious and had a very deep bathtub which I loved, able to soak up to my neck. McCall is an interesting dichotomy with very wealthy people that live there part time or have mega cabins there. There's also more people like Dave and I who just go up for a day or the weekend. Then you have a lot of service workers, many of whom are seasonal. The ski season hasn't quite started yet, since there's really no snow to speak of. We drove up to Brundage Mountain to see what the ski slopes look like and not for sure-After we drove back towards town, we drove part way around the lake, but sadly part of the road was closed for construction. We didn't make the normal loop all the way around, but stopped here right after breakfast. Sunday morning. It's a short walk from the hotel-Payette Lake Boats out for the winterDidn't find anything at the usual thrift store I usually go to. We tried a couple new food places- one for breakfast and one for coffee in the afternoon. We're probably like a lot of people who don't go up there very often, we tend to stay at the restaurants on the main drag. We had lunch at a local brewery place, great burgers, fun decor!We had a really nice dinner at Rupert's restaurant next door to the hotel. They have some really unique decor!Big wooden airplane propsI asked her waitress since it was our 25th anniversary if she could take a photo of us. She obliged and also brought out a brownie with a sparkler sticking out of it! Was kind of like a short round sparkler with a spike on the end that they stuck in the brownie. That got every body's attention in the room for sure. Is it cool idea and I couldn't get my camera phone out fast enough since I didn't know if it was going to start a fire! Magnesium flaring up 2 feet, wow! It was really nice and festive and someone else was celebrating a birthday. We watched the sun go down over the lake.Lots of windows facing the lakeIt was definitely colder up there than in Boise. It was 14 degrees yesterday with morning lots of frost! But this sky was beautiful and we had a nice leisurely drive back. We decided to go there again next year and already looking at booking another stay.Anya is ready for winterWinter Is Here!There are few leaves still falling down, but the cold weather is definitely here. We've had some weather in the teens and twenties already.  We're hopefully going to have some serious rain in a few days, as it's been really really dry. There's no snow in the foothills yet, a little unusual but it's early in the winter still. The coop is all prepped for winter except for the sun room. I'm hoping for eggs soon! Someone has been in the nesting box, so that's a good sign. *** UPDATE- we got our first egg today from one of the new hens! Yeah!The winter bird bath is out, great in the really cold weather-Gnome is tucked in tooGirls had some free range time today, loved it!Sarah is getting big!Our maple tree still has a lot of leaves on it, as well as our apple tree. We just really need some wind or to take care of that. The comforter is on the bed along with flannel sheets, and the new Ikea cover Dave and I got in Salt Lake City. Anya likes to burrow when it colder-furry paws sticking outWe swapped out our more mild weather clothing for polar fleece, sweatshirts, flannel blouses. Hats and gloves are out and we are getting ready for Thanksgiving. We hosting this year with everyone else bringing some side dishes. With two toddlers here I'm sure it will be busy!"},
{"title": "Worx Electric Leaf Blower Review, More Winter Prep, Thrifting At Target", "date": "Nov 4, 2018", "text": "Worx Electric Leaf Blower Review-Well it's that time of year when the leaves are falling and it's time to rake them up. A lot of our leaves are already down in the front yard, but we still have our big maple tree in the backyard holding onto some. After I was cleaning up our driveway and back deck I realized I never did a review on our little mini electric leaf blower! After using it for a few years I decided I would share my experiences here if you're interested. I bought it when I was having some back problems, and was having a lot of trouble sweeping the driveway and front sidewalks. I've never liked gas blowers that they tend to be really loud, would be overkill for us and you have to deal with gas/oil mixtures. When I saw this blower I thought it might be a good fit. It turns out I was right! It's lightweight, has a rechargeable lithium battery, and is really easy to use-Small charger works greatSeparate from just blowing leaves you can also use it to clear off your deck/turf, clear out your gutters of dry leaves, and blow leaves out of your flower beds in the spring. You can also blow them IN before winter. So there's actually quite a few things you can use it for. Ours came with the accessory kit to clean car interiors, but you may not need it.  It's just a nice extra feature. If you click on the tab you can see more info on features and accessories that come with it. The battery recharges pretty quickly, snaps right in. It has a simple on/off button, and runs for about 1-2 hours. So if you want something that's lightweight, easy to use, and quieter this is really a nice blower! DO NOT BUY the 20 Volt as that would probably be really under powered. If you click on this link you can also shop for the other versions-    Leaf Covered herb boxMore Winter Prep-With highs in the 40's is forecast for next week, lows in the 20s, winter is right around the corner! Last night I used some of our last counter-ripened tomatoes/jalapenos for salsa. We have a few more left that we will freeze and then we are done with the veggie garden produce. It's really great to be able to slice into a homegrown tomato and have the juice go all over the cutting board! We continued more of our winter prep yesterday since the weather was dry and it was actually pretty mild, 58 degrees. It rained last night and more for today, so we got going while the going was good. I washed my car, cleaned out the inside really well and wiped everything down. Dave did more mowing and raking of leaves to go into the compost pile. We packed up all the Halloween decor, inside and out. More leaves dropping soon-We went to the local Ace Hardware store with multiple coupons and got some really great deals. We bought a heavy-duty exterior extension cord to power the coop, since the old one died. We also got another outdoor extension cord for heated bird bath. It's in the herb box above and I still need to harvest the Rosemary. It's easy not to notice when those power cords are getting too many dents and dings. Dave always inspects them after we haven't used them in a while. He works in the electrical field. Always better to replace when you need to, and if you can get a great deal, even better. I've also never liked the look of orange power cords laying across the yard, so for the same price we bought dark brown. It just disappears. We packed up all the tools on our garden work bench and I covered it up with plastic for the season- I gave it multiple coats of paint this spring so I wanted to protect the new paint job. The top gets the most wear from rain and snow. We always put all the tools in the garage in a bucket where we can still get them. We don't leave them out in the weather all winter. We also got two new heat bulbs, since the 2 pack was so cheap (coupon) to heat up the coop if needed. I have never seen a 2-pack for $10.00. I only use those if its really really low twenties or colder. I'm going to get out some of her homemade frozen pasta sauce tonight and make a big pot of pasta with some salad and French bread. Perfect food going into a cold week. I washed and put out winter comforter out with our new cover from Ikea. I bought a King size since they can run a little small and I like more coverage. We were warm and toasty last night! I stored the quilt and fleece blanket for next spring...Thrifting At Target-I haven't been to Target for quite a while and I needed to buy some spray-on water repellent for shoes. I had some that I needed a treat before going into winter. For some odd reason it can be hard to find. While I was there I went through there little dollar store section and found a few fun things. I bought a little fake feather tree fr the house, $1.00, about 6\" high-Also a fun little banner that I'm going to take a work to work that says Be Merry, $3.00And my sign above that says Good Tidings... It was the last sign that they had and when I turned it over I realized that the hanging hardware was upside down. It was supposed to be $3, but when I got to the checkout register I pointed it out the cashier and he charged me half price! Pretty good deal so I was happy. Just goes to show you can still negotiate a few things here and there. I'll take off the upside down bracket and move it to the correct side. Luckily it had little tiny phillips screws, so I can unscrew them, move to other side. I dropped off more donations to a local thrift store. I decided, in the interest of saving money and Dave's labor, not to replace some of our exterior holiday lights. Some died last year and I appreciate the fact that he does most of the outside work on those. I help with some, but mostly concentrate on the inside. It will be a win-win. Less work and save money. And it will still look great!"},

{"title": "Prepping The House, Cars & Coop For Winter, Affiliate Earnings Reveal! ", "date": "Oct 27, 2018", "text": "Coming soon!Prepping The House, Cars & Coop For Winter-With winter just around the corner next week we are wrapping up the prepping phase for winter.We have temperatures dropping 20 degrees tomorrow night, with lows in the low 30's, highs in the low 50's. It's supposed to be around 70 today.In our winter prep we include both of our cars. Recently they have both been waxed, much needed. We added new wiper blades (Costco's great deal!), I put in a car size spare blanket, ice scraper/snow sweep. It does snow here on occasion. Good to do early when the weather is nice. Dave cleaned up his work bench in the garage today. No big projects looming, that we know of.With the house we've been re-caulking windows. Dave had rinsed off some spider webs on a window in the summer and I found there was actually some water on the inside of the window sill. Not a good idea. We installed new windows about 10+  years ago, since the old ones were pretty well toast. To say this house had little insulation when we bought it(attic and windows) is an understatement! We both caulked the new windows really well. After 10 years it was time for a refresh and so Dave re-did all the windows again. No ladders for me with a brace on my arm! Caulking keeps the cold weather and helps the house stay cooler in the summer. We already put the vegetable garden to bed. Sad looking but that's it, just an empty space. We added more compost to the cold frame to break down over the winter. It's kind of cute that one of the annual flowers that went into the compost pile is actually still alive!One of the things I always do is clean off and cover up our garden work bench with clear plastic to protect it from the elements. We store the tools in the garage for easy access if we need them. I repainted the bench early this summer since the wood stain was pretty well shot. We bought it right after we bought this house since the deck was fairly small, but we needed some kind of work space. It's held up really well, it just needed a fresh coat of paint. We already closed the foundation vents. New furnace filters, extra batteries, and water jugs. I'll empty the rain barrel soon since it freezes.For the coop Dave already added the lower window to cover up the bottom portion of the coop. It got spattered with mud during our 1\" record rain fall recently, so he cleaned it up today, here's the before shot, no after sorry-It replaces the hardware cloth in the winter. Late tomorrow, or weather depending, I'm going to cover the screen top of the coop main door-We'd had a couple of cold nights and didn't have any clear plastic on hand so David covered it with a black garbage bag. I took that down when the weather warmed up again, since the weather has been crazy! We use the deep litter method in the coop and it worked amazingly well. David cleaned the coop out a two weeks ago, the pine shavings/poo went to the city compost. They finally added compost totes to our garbage service this year and it's been great! We have built up the soil level so much over 10 to 12 years that we can't really add a whole lot more to it. So we either give the pine shavings away to our kids or it goes in the compost tote. I touched up the paint today on the coop since there was a few spots that needed it. Luckily we had some paint left, since it was the old house trim color. I still like it!BeforeAfter- This is possibly the last weekend of real warm weather, as far as I can tell. Time for these kinds of outside jobs, so we get them done fast. Dave mowed and stored the hoses, covered the water spigots with their styrofoam caps. In the next day or two we will lay out the big industrial, exterior extension cord that we use to power the coop, including the heated water and the two lights. We have a reptile light that we use on the upper part of the coop for a little extra heat when it's really really cold. We also have infrared heat lamp that's hardwired in. I don't really use either of those until it's in the low 20's, or lower. We always add extra pine shavings when it gets really cold and that seems to help quite a bit. I am proud to say that none of my chickens have ever had major frostbite over all the winter's that we have kept them. They can go out in the cold weather and there's enough ventilation to keep them healthy. They all seem to deal with the cold very well. We will put up the \"sun room\" (to photo) when it gets colder, for extra space in the rain and snow. All made from recycled materials and custom built by Dave to fit onto the coop. I'll keep an eye on the forecast. In a year or two we may need to re-build the coop. Time will tell. When you design your own coop (after tons of research) there's always things that can be tweaked.Affiliate Earnings Reveal!I was reading an article today that some \"Instagrammers\" now call themselves \"Bloggers\", but don't have an actual blog. They post photos with a few sentences on Instagram. Not much writing involved. Sometimes it's about making money and that's all. I know there are some bloggers who are young, competitive, have no families and work 24/7 at a job and they blog. They make quite a bit of $, but I just can't do that. I sit at a computer all day at work and don't want to do that at home. My eyes object as well. This post today took several hours, for instance, not counting photos and editing. I read this post today and it is a FASCINATING read The Dark Side Of BloggingIf you've been following this blog for a while you have probably seen my Amazon affiliate statement and the various items that you can click through, and buy to help support this blog. I get a tiny percentage. It's been really interesting to see what did, and didn't happen, with Amazon. If you look below you can see what my total earnings have been for the last 90 days, and well, it's pretty pathetic-Yep, $1.72. They owe me about $10.00, but won't pay me til it hits $20.00. Nice. Ironically I actually have made more through product click-through at Hometalk. I was actually shocked when I got an email saying that I had earned $57.00. It was my first payment. It works like this- people read my DIY projects on Hometalk. When I list specific items, like my back splash material in my kitchen, they can go to the bottom of the post, then buy that item. That goes as a credit towards me and eventually I can make some money doing that. It was actually pretty funny when I got an email from them saying that I had earned money. I thought it was a scam, but it wasn't. Here's a screenshot from Paypal-I have posted 11 DIY projects, taking about an hour each. So, it's been an interesting experiment. Since I basically don't get any income from this blog I've been writing for years, maybe there's hope. Do you make any money off your blog?"},
{"title": "Independence Days Challenge", "date": "Oct 24, 2018", "text": "Independence Days Challenge-It's been just gorgeous fall weather with a touch of winter in the air. The days are getting a little bit cooler this week in the mid-60s going down to low 30s at night for next week. It maybe a cold Halloween! Neighbor kitty Poesy found a nice spot yesterday by our raised bed-Then gorgeous skies, with orange clouds-We've been doing lots of miscellaneous things and thought this would be a good post to catch them all up. So here we go...1. Plant Something-As usual we do not do fall plantings, but I did buy a nice purple Mum for the front porch!2. Harvest Something-.We had already harvested the last of the tomatoes and they are ripening nicely on the counter. The weather has been so mild I was holding off harvesting the last of my herbs. My herb box has a nice big rosemary plant in it, lemon thyme and oregano. Will harvest soon. No eggs.3. Preserve/Store Something-We decided to stock up on a few things when we were out grocery shopping. I bought a nice big 20 Lb. bag of rolled oats. We'll use it for ourselves and also for a treat in the winter for our chickens, great deal! I stored some outside and the rest in big gallon glass jars in the pantry. We've been freezing the tomatoes as they ripen on the counter. We bought some extra dry goods when we saw a really great deals. Things like egg noodles, granola bars, and clearance-price gourmet breads. I also bought a bottle of dark red wine since I want to make some beef stew soon. Nothing like beef stew on a really cold night! Will be stocking up on a few more things at Costco soon, since I do not go near that store until after the holidays. It's really nice to see that our freezer in the garage is actually just about completely full! It was about half-full this summer after we'd used up last year's veggies, fruits and meats. Now we have more fruits, veggies and lots of other yummy things. I do need to stock up on some meats soon, will watch for good deals.4. Manage Reserves- Get a GoodDeal/Barter/Stock Up/Prep-We did get a good deal at the local Ace Hardware for wild bird food, good to keep for emergencies for chickens as well as feeding the local wildlife. $10 for 20 Lbs is a great deal so we got two! Bought some heavy, clear plastic to enclose the main coop door, and cover our work bench on the back deck. Got a few decor items including this, $7.00, keeping with my Scandinavian holiday goodies!5. Eat the Food- Try NewFoods/Recipe-I have a new recipe I saw that I'm going to try soon, tangy red pepper sauce over pork chops. Looks great! Would work on others things as well, it's here - Roasted Red Pepper Vinegar SauceRoasted Red Pepper-Vinegar SauceRoasted red peppers add sweetness to this sauce, and hot cherry peppers bring some heat. Garlic, tangy vinegar, briny anchovies, and a generous amount of olive oil round out the flavors. This sauce is an excellent accompaniment to lean meats such as pork chops or chicken breast.Ingredients-¾ cup jarred roasted red peppers, rinsed and patted dry2 jarred hot cherry peppers, stems removed2 garlic cloves, peeled2 teaspoons dried rosemary, lightly crushed2 anchovy fillets, rinsed and patted dry½ teaspoon Salt⅛ teaspoon pepper¼ cup water2 tablespoons white wine vinegar  (Red wine vinegar or sherry vinegar can be substituted for the            white wine vinegar, if desired.)Instructions, Serves 4, makes about 1 Cup-Pulse red peppers, cherry peppers, garlic, rosemary, anchovies, salt, and pepper in food processor until finely chopped, 15 to 20 pulses. Add water and vinegar and pulse briefly to combine. Transfer mixture to medium bowl and add water and vinegar. Add ⅓  cup extra-virgin olive oil, 2  tablespoons minced fresh parsley, slowly whisk in oil until fully incorporated. Stir in parsley.6. Build Community Food Systems-Waiting for the hens to start laying to sell some excess eggs. The 2 older ones molted, big time, and the 2 younger ones are close to laying. 7. Recycle/Re-Use-We've been cleaning out closets again and donating more things. I recycled some things inside the house recently when I redid our guest bedroom with more of a French country feel-8. Skill Up-I have been studying local politics more lately since we have a big election coming up. While the powers-that-be keep a pretty good stranglehold on things it's still good to vote.9. Regenerate What is Lost/SalvageSomething-My hand is doing well, still in the brace for 3 more weeks. I'll switch to a small brace and then wean off. Learning to mouse left handed has been hard. I'm so glad we're not buried at work! We were having some issues with our Subaru Outback and took it to the dealer. It turned out that the battery and battery cables were under warranty and that was the problem. Free replacements! It was also running a little bit odd, they asked where we bought our gas and Dave usually buys it at Costco. They told him not to buy gas ever again at Costco and here is why- when you sell a high volume of gasoline you're constantly putting in more gasoline into the pump tanks. Residue and grit in the gas never has a chance to settle, so it winds up in your fuel lines. They said they bought a gallon or two and ran it through a coffee filter. They said It was full of tons of grit and debris. Good to know! Since two of our fruit trees have a fungus I bought some Copper Fungicide spray. It kills the fungus naturally and will save our trees. I forgot to spray last fall and our poor peach and pear trees suffered. No more! Just waiting for all the leaves to fall off in another week or two."},

I went out to dinner by myself since Dave had to work late, really relaxed and had a nice meal.  I went home and was giving Anya the cat some love and looked out the back yard window. My black hen was in the yard laying down. Sometimes they take dust baths and kind of doze off or just hang out. From what I could see she was not moving at all, not a good sign. I hustled out and my beautiful Pru was cold and very dead. She was quite a bit bigger than in the photo above, pretty well full grown and a beautiful black Australorp. The only thing I could see was that her neck appeared to be broken, and she had a pretty major wound on her side. I suspect it was a hawk attack. That's kind of odd if it was a hawk, that it didn't eat more? I'm not sure if there's a possibility that the four hens drove off a hawk or maybe it was an immature hawk? I don't know, which is a little frustrating but regardless we lost her. One less hen but what can you do? Sigh..."},
{"title": "My No-Budget French Country Bedroom Makeover, Basil Harvest/Pesto Time!", "date": "Oct 14, 2018", "text": "My No-Budget French Country Bedroom Makeover-Recovering from hand surgery has been kind of challenging, and I was glad I was home for the week.  I'm grateful my work benefits include extended sick leave. Sometimes you see a lot of things that need to get done, but you can't do them yourself so they just have to wait. Dave has been really great with picking up the slack, but he's been working all week. I kept looking at our spare bedroom and realized I could do something, even with one good hand. I had painted the bedroom several years ago into a very white yellow, still love that color so I was not about to repaint that! It had turned into a bit of a storage area-Baby themed art/mobileBaby stuffMore stuffSometimes you think you know what you're going to need and then needs change. That was the case with our spare bedroom, that we turned into sort of a grand baby nursery. I was looking at the space the last couple of weeks and realized we really weren't babysitting that much anymore. Time for the baby decor to be reorganized or given away. We wanted to keep the crib, the books, the toys, etc. I really like French Country/farm decor and have so many fun pieces, mostly thrifted. I decided it was time to redo the bedroom. My challenge to myself was to do without spending any money. I could re-do it since many of the items in the bedroom could either be donated, given away or stored elsewhere. That would give me more of a clean slate to work from. Since we had bought a new queen comforter cover from Ikea I decided to re-use the old one on the twin bed. The ticking fabric would be a nice neutral accent, went from bright blue comforter to white/blue ticking-I wanted to keep the existing wire bookcase as it has nice lines and is a good size. I empted it out, then sorted and refilled-Removed the prints and exercise machineDonationsDonated machine we never use, we may get a used treadmill we can leave outStored printsMy sewing machine stays in the room since that's a good place for it-The corner of the room with all of the baby gear was downsized-We didn't need tiny blankets anymore, just kept the larger napping blankets and moved them. I hung up some prints that I have been storing and that gave the room a definite more adult look. So I'll probably tweak it more overtime. For now I really like it and will continue to see what works for all of us!Basil Harvest/Pesto Time!Winter is definitely on the horizon since we had our first hard freeze yesterday! I had the basil plants on the deck covered up with plastic the last two days, but it was time to harvest. Since I am still using primarily one hand Dave and I set up a pesto making station tonight after dinner. One sinkful-I used my favorite recipe and we made a nice big batch using this recipe Rosie's Pesto. We did the one plant that was really large and got 6 jars out of that batch. We ran out of fresh lemon juice so I will buy some more today and we can finish up the other batch. It smells amazing in the kitchen, like garlic and fresh basil! This freezes so well if you haven't ever tried it I'd really encourage you to make some. Freezing in the small batches works great so you can use it for pastas, or smear it on roasting chicken. That's one of my personal favorites! It's also great on broiled Italian bread. Bon appetit!"},
{"title": "Thrifting Scores, Hand Surgery Progress", "date": "Oct 9, 2018", "text": "Thrifting Scores-It's 45 degrees and pouring rain today, clearing a bit now. Good day to be inside! First snow for the mountains is due!!! UPDATE**** We had almost 1\" of rain, and set a new record!***The geraniums are inside now, Basil outside will be pesto this weekend. A branch came down today so the tree guy is coming tomorrow for a bid to trim our huge maple and apple trees. It's much cheaper for pruning in the fall, after the leaves are off. We'll shoot for next month probably.  We've found some great deals in the last couple weeks at various thrift stores and on eBay. I also took 2 bags to donate and a box of household items. I found a little wooden sign, above, for $5 at Goodwill, also found the two hanging Day of the Dead colorful signs for a buck each-At the thrift store in McCall I found these brand new Born sandals, $5.00 saving them for next summer-We went out Sunday since I was bored out of my gourd being at home for 3 days. We went to a different Goodwill and I found a nice, deep, embossed turkey serving platter, $6 which now has ripening green tomatoes on it.  I asked Dave to harvest them before it rained and hit the 30's-I also found a DVD at one of my favorite movies The Secret Life of Walter Mitty, and a new Land's End fleece textured top, great for winter.On eBay I found an LED European-style star string of lights. I haven't a plugged them in yet since I had to order a European to US current converter. The cord is basically clear so you really just see the stars. I've been looking for these for years after I'd seen them online.I'll post a photo once I get the converter and have it plugged in. The converter was 3 bucks and the lights were 10 so it was a pretty good deal all in all. The lights also have box w/3 settings- steady, slow flash or fast flash. I'll use them in the kitchen. Hand Surgery Progress-I had my hand surgery Friday morning and so far so good. Dave has taken great care of me! Having anesthesia is always a really strange thing because it makes you feel pretty loopy. They start off of Valium to relax you and then I had Versed which made the lights on the ceiling move around in an interesting fashion. After that I went into surgery with a \"heavy sedation\" instead of \"full anesthesia\". Next thing I knew I woke up and was all done. I had breakfast when I got home and took some medication and went to sleep for a few hours since I was really groggy. By that evening I felt pretty alert but pain medication always makes you feel a little off as well. I slept couple of times during the day, but made it through the yesterday without any naps, which is good. I'm off my pain meds, just using Aleve and Turmeric. I'm keeping my hand elevated and iced or it really swells up. It's pretty awkward being right-handed and having to use my left hand for everything but I'm getting used to it. I will be off this week and go back next Monday.  This Thursday I'll get my next brace which is much better, more use of my fingers, probably like my last one-So I'm going to be doing a lot of reading at home this week and catching up on movies."},
{"title": "Winter Is Coming, Potato Growing Experiment Results, Autumn Decor, Hand Surgery AGAIN", "date": "Oct 3, 2018", "text": "Winter Is Coming-I wish I had a funny way of saying Game of Throne's winter is coming. Anyway we're getting some 30 degree weather here in the next week or so and finally some decent rain! Exciting news because it has been dry for months and months and months and months. We've been slowly getting the house ready for the cooler weather, closing up the foundation vents, cleaning out the veggie garden of the last of the tomatoes and peppers. That opened up the garden more for the hens, so they're happy!I asked Dave to take down our 3 bird houses so we could clean them before winter. One was so full of yellow jacket nests that he had to spray it, so it had to go in the garbage. Luckily we have lots of used cedar boards and we can make a new one in the spring. He put the one back up, and the other birdhouse needed a little retrofitting. This tall birdhouse we bartered for at a landscaping and rock facility. I called ahead of time and said we were removing a lot of gravel, if we brought some in could we barter for something else and they said sure! So for some pea gravel we didn't need we got a really cool birdhouse. The problem started up when they squirrels decided to enlarge the hole so that the birds wouldn't use it.I asked Dave to remove the front piece with the hole and replace it with a fresh piece of cedar. He went ahead and reconfigured the hole to be much smaller so that the small birds will start using it. We also moved it to the backyard where it has more open space around it-I love the vintage ceramic door knob!Potato Growing Experiment Results-This is just my favorite time of year since it is so much cooler when you're doing gardening! It was 48 degrees this weekend in the a.m. We've moved down into the 70s and that's pretty typical this time of year. I documented are potato growing experiment in a couple of different posts-Growing Potatoes In Garbage Cans and Potato ProgressI had wanted to try growing potatoes in garbage cans since our ground space was a little bit limited by other growing stuff. Basically we watered really well a couple of times a week over the summer and things didn't seem to be growing well from what we could tell. We didn't really get a lot of potato flowers that other people mention just a couple of really small ones. Of course in the bottom of the garbage can its impossible to tell what is going on down there. So we decided decided to harvest some this weekend and see where things were at. The small blue tote had red potatoes and the two taller black ones had Yukon golds. Since the potatoes were free we only had to buy potting soil which was recommended and with her hard soil not a bad idea. Then we did spend less than $10 on the blue tote so it was a minimal investment money-wise. I had fresh potatoes a few years ago for the first time and they are so much different than what you buy in the grocery store! Much more creamy and tender. So I decided we should unearth any potatoes in the blue tote first and so it was easiest to move with the handles and that's where we found... one lone little red tater (see above).Dave opened up the other two totes tonight, nothing! Since the potatoes were gifted it could be they were all dudes. Well, it looked good in the tote! We may buy some seed potatoes next year and try again...Autumn Decor-Last weekend I put out our Autumn decor. I like to have seasonal things out to mark the changes of the year. I bought a few pumpkins and got out the rest of my table top and shelf decor unpacked. Dave got some free corn stalks for the front from a local community garden. There was a big sign- FREE STALKS!I had my nice old vintage Basin and I bought a couple of bags of pumpkin fillers in pastel colors to transition since it was too early but these things out last month. I'm not the kind of person who likes putting orange pumpkins out when it's 90 degrees in September! I went ahead and added a small pumpkin in the middle now that I'm switching over to the traditional fall colors. Here's a little tour of some things we have up inside the house-I made the cotton metal planter myself!Outside we have a little fall mat by the front door, a little flag and when is closer to Halloween will put up decorations outside the house. That's always fun for the trick-or-treaters.Hand Surgery, Again-Boy did I clean the house last week! Because... it's that time again. About 2 years ago I had surgery on my left thumb since the bone at the base of the thumb was really worn. Severe arthritis. I was in continual pain and losing my grip strength. It was a quite a recovery for several months, wearing different braces, but now my left thumb is pain-free and I have my grip strength back. Now it's time for my right hand. I probably won't be blogging much after this for a week or so until I get the initial big, honking brace off, I have to wear this for the first week-Then I'll be fitted with a smaller black, adjustable one for 2 months. Basically (spoiler alert don't read ahead if you have a sensitive stomach) they make an incision at the base of the thumb and take out the square metacarpal bone that is all worn. Then they basically suture the heck out of it so the upper piece of my thumb has something to rest on that won't cause pain. I do a couple months with a big wrist/forearm brace to keep the thumb stationary. Then I go to a smaller mini split, then start doing OT to stretch my thumb/hand/fingers. My hand surgeon did a great job the first time and it actually wasn't that expensive relatively speaking. Thanks god for insurance! I'll be home all next week from work watching Netflix and DVDs with Anya the cat. Send some good energy my way, thanks!"},
{"title": "DIY Framing Poster Kit, Chicken And Pea Tray Bake, Autumn Day Trip", "date": "Sep 26, 2018", "text": "DIY Framing Poster Kit-After buying my lovely $5 wildflower poster from the University of Utah Science Museum I wanted to frame it. After getting sticker shock looking at regular frames I decided to go with this $15 version. It's two dowels made of oak and one of the dowels has a cord across the top. The dowels are actually half dowels, with a very sticky double-sided strip on the back. When I got it in the mail I read the simple directions and got to work. Basically I turned the poster upside down and lined up the half dowels I made sure they were centered and did the bottom first. I basically rolled the dowel sticky side down on to the bottom of the poster. Then I did the same thing on the top. I had the dowel on the top of the paper a little bit below the edge and then rolled it on to the edge sticky side down-I pushed really hard on both side and gave it a really good push. It stuck really well and I love the way it looks, so for $15 I'm happy!Chicken And Pea Tray Bake-I was watching Nigella Lawson's cooking show on PBS a while back and saw this recipe. Epicurious.com Basically you use a cookie sheet, poor 2 lb of frozen peas on it, mix the other ingredients and pour over the peas and the sliced leeks. Toss well, then you put the chicken thighs on top skin side up. Next to drizzle with olive oil and a little salt and roast everything. Dave and I both found the dish a little bit too salty so I would cut back on that next time, but it was great otherwise! The peas still had a little bit of bite and the chicken was super moist with a very crispy skin. The idea is that the frozen peas release some steam/liquid and helps keep the chicken super moist. You could also try try this with other kinds of vegetables. It's a keeper!Payette LakeAutumn Day Trip-Dave had really been wanting to go up to McCall recently and so Friday I told him let's go. We went up for the day Saturday and it was cool and windy and gorgeous. We went to our favorite brewery restaurant for lunch, hit our favorite thrift store where I found a new pair of Born Shoes for $5. I also found something fun for a blogger's son that will ship that to him soon. We stopped at a park and watched the lake and a lone sail boat -Cute!We drove all the way around the lake and on the North side the wind was really strong and the waves looked dark and angry-It was about 68 degrees and partly sunny but that wind was cold. We hit a nice pastry store on the way out, no need for dinner when we got home! It was really a great way to spend an autumn day up in the mountains, seeing the leaves changing and people bundled up a bit. We're going to go back for anniversary in November to spend the night, looking forward to that."},
{"title": "Dry Brush Blanket Striped Step Stool, Traditional Italian Zucchini in Tomato Sauce, More Harvest!", "date": "Sep 19, 2018", "text": "Dry Brush Blanket Striped Step Stool-I recently purchased a painted white step stool from Ikea that I decided to do something fun with. They are super heavy duty and great design! There were tons of images online of fun ways people hacked their step stools. If there's no Ikea near you you can buy one on Amazon!                                                                                                                                  I was really afraid of making a mess painting it, so I decided to go for some simple blanket stripes. After reading a few articles about dry brushing I thought that might be a good technique to use on this. It's very forgiving, so if you make a mistake it's pretty simple to dry brush over it. So here's the basics...Top stepDO NOT ASSEMBLE!  It's much easier to do the paint technique before you put the step stool together. I started with the square to mark where I wanted the stripes with pencil. I had both the top and bottom steps of the step stool. I taped both of them off after measuring. It's hard to see in the photo but the white paint was actually fairly thin on the top and didn't cover very well in the center of the top step. Taped off-Basically after placement of the tape I came back with some French blue acrylic craft paint, 1st coat of paint-I did have to do two coats for full coverage, then I let dry overnight. I think you can see from the photo that the tape did not seal very well on to the wood and the edges were a little bit rough. Next time I'll use a different brand. I should add this was a no-cost project, except for the stool.I came back with a very wide putty knife and cleaned up the edges a little bit.  It was a good thing I was going to dry brush over it, which softened the flaws. I came back the next day with a very dry old brush and white acrylic paint. I test drove it on an old paint stick-When they say dry brush they really mean it! I use very, very little paint. I brushed a tiny bit onto a used paint stick to get an idea of what it would look like. I went over both steps twice and just kept going until I thought it looked good-Dave and I put it together last night and it is sturdy, very solid wood. I think it came out great and I really like the look! So don't be afraid to dry brush, it's really easy but just use very very little paint! I am going to use a little clear, brush on sealer over the stripes. I love it and may buy the dark wood if we go back. Great for kids, an end table, displays, as a stool. They are very multipurpose!Traditional Italian Zucchini in Tomato Sauce-Too much zucchini? Yes, that's me, so what to do? I remembered years ago buying canned Italian zucchini to try. Mushy but good flavor. I looked up recipes online and decided to try this oneLacuochinasopraffina.com. Pretty simple and you can adjust as needed. It was great served with roasted chicken and topped with a little Romano cheese.More Harvest!I think we're in what's traditionally called high summer although it's also getting cooler. We have lots of tomatoes coming in, so I froze some last weekend and we'll be doing more this weekend-We've harvested most of the ripe tomatoes and peppers. I froze 2 quarts of mixed tomatoes and they are nestled into the freezer. I'm planning on making some pasta sauce this weekend if I have enough ripe one. I will wait another week or two if not. The weather is getting cooler with the low forties forecast in a couple of nights. I'm hoping things will keep ripening before we get our first hard freeze."},

It's getting cooler here and wearing my first flannel blouse of the season. October tends to bring our first big storms. Interestingly enough the Farmer's Almanac has predicted our first SNOW will be in October! I'll be prepping the coop soon and getting ready for winter. Yep, WINTER! I have several links with really great information on what kinds of things you may want to have on hand. There's also tons more online. There's also a link below about how to save money while prepping. Don't forget one of the main things you need to have on hand is water as you may not have access to some depending on what kind of emergency you might have. Extra food, fuel, pet foods, baby/child items, OTC and prescription medications are always a must. We just stocked up on canned goods, batteries and I am storing more water. While we have a 55 gallon rain barrel it would need to be filtered (we have a filter) but we have to empty it for the winter. I can buy a gallon of water for $1.00 each, so it's easy to buy a few at a time. I personally don't favor reusing milk jugs, etc. for water storage. Some folks can also use alternative methods for heat, woodstove (still want one) or have a generator. We have a camping stove and several Kero heaters, but not for indoor use. We could use in the garage for cooking in a vented area. From Ready.govThis display had a really great group of items on the shelf as far as preparedness. Bleach is a really great disinfectant either straight or diluted. Things like paper plates, buckets, garbage bags, TP, protein bars, first aid items, etc. Tips to save money here Budget Friendly Preparedness KitIt's great to think about your neighbors too and how you could help each other. Great post here Climate Change and Building Our Community  Thanks Wendy!From Ikea.com.USStyling A Glass DomeThe photo below of the Ikea painted step stool on Pinterest (couldn't find original link) gave me the idea about buying this glass dome. I had wanted one for a long time but they tend to be more than what I wanted to spend. I ordered hand towels from Ikea online and saw they had a great deal for $9.00. It has a nice, solid wood base and is 4\" x 8\" high. The ones in the store had a shiny gold base, not my thing. When I saw the little printed card inside below I thought what a great idea! After mine arrived I printed my own with a free printable off of Google. For winter I may put a small snowman or something else inside. Inspiration-My version below. I tried multiple time to get a good shot, but glass is shiny! Best I could do-The great thing about these is you can put anything inside them! I saw Star Wars toys, sea shells, feathers, Lavender, you name it! You can stack on top of books, and use multiples in different sizes.  Ikea sells two, mine's the smaller one.

Ouch! I went to the manufacturer's website Cavallini.com and found these-Oak Dowel hanging kit, $15.00The poster website has gorgeous bags, prints and more, check it out! No, they're not reimbursing me, just nice stuff! I should have in a week or so and will post a photo.Installing Ikea Medicine Cabinet-We installed our new Ikea bathroom cabinet this weekend and it looks great! I have a very white blue I painted on the walls originally. The directions were pretty clear that came with it, and took us about 2 1/2 hours to install. You want to take the time to do it correctly. When I looked at the tag I was interested to see where the cabinet was actually manufactured, it was in Italy!Has a really nice finish and is very roomy. The first thing we did was basically lay everything out on a card table with the towel since the two of us were going to put it together simultaneously. It was much easier to sit down to do this. They even supplied a little short screwdriver but we used our own. Basically we laid out the directions and started counting all the hardware which is included, then laid out the pieces. Since you use the mirror door last we set it aside. Basically you attach all the hardware as you go to create the box of the cabinet. Which we did. Then you had the back piece which two slides into the slot. Make the box into a cabinet, put on the back-We didn't use the cheap plastic anchors, that they included, since they're not really heavy duty. Dave bought 3/4\" L brackets and we used those. Bolt them into the studs.Then we mounted the cabinet on the wall, adding the door last. We tried to add the door per the directions but that was tricky. Basically they say to add the hardware to the door, then attach that hardware to the cabinet. We found it was much easier to reverse the process, by adding the hardware to the cabinet and then attaching it to the door. So we got it up, it's level and it looks great. I have 3 shelves and tons of storage. The old one will go to free Craigslist. Love the new one! Independence Days Challenge-This time of year is definitely a busy time so here's a review of what we've been up to recently. Last weekend there was fruit all over the counters and dining table, not a bad thing!1. Plant Something- No, it's harvest time! We don't do fall/winter gardens here, too much erratic weather. 2. Harvest Something- No eggs, both girls molting, but the younger ones should start in a month or so. Herbs, tomatoes, cukes, pears, peppers, beans, and squash have been really coming in steadily and it was time to start freezing somethings. We'll dig up the 3 bins of potatoes soon too! Our organic pears3. Preserve/Store Something- Freezing veggies and fruits. We were gifted by one of Dave's co-workers with some huge, ripe peaches! That was great since our peach tree did not have a large harvest this year. I decided to freeze all of them except a few to eat. We have lots of fresh pears that I baked. More are on the tree, but not that much. Too little to can IMO. I found a great deal on fresh Blackberries and local gourmet Italian breads. Pesto is coming soon with my 2' high Basil, to freeze in little jars. One of the things I like to do is to add some of the sweet Gypsy peppers and Italian peppers to the frozen tomatoes. Since I will primarily use frozen tomatoes to make pasta sauces in the winter or soups that's always a good addition. I'll be freezing kale soon too. This weekend will be food preservation as a top priority.It's always nice to be able to fill up your freezer! Free!Off to the freezer, 4 gallon bagsMore to eat fresh4. Manage Reserves- Get a GoodDeal/Barter/Stock Up/Prep- Dave and I cleaned out our bedroom pantry closet of some older items, creating more room. There were some dry mixes and some canned goods that were past their prime. It's a good reminder not to buy odd foods just because they're on sale and then not use them! The good news- it freed up some room to move things around and open up some space for canned goods that we do use on a regular basis. I always keep things like canned beans on hand to make quick soups. I always love to make homemade soups and pasta sauces on the weekends when I have time. Love to let them really simmer and reach full flavor. I do used dried beans as well. Sometimes on a work night though it's nice to have things like canned beans to just be able to chop up some vegetables and throw it in a pot for an hour. It's a fairly instant dinner. I know there's a big thing about the instant pot but sometimes it's just another thing to buy and store. And it's just the two of us I don't really see the need for that. Got a $10.00 coupon for a nice sale shirt at L.L. Bean, scored for $12.00, free shipping. Perfect for work! Got a $50.00 Amazon gift card from a business acquaintance and Dave and I split it. I got a new wireless weather station, was $85.00 for $17.00 and some teas. I'm a weather geek, what can I say? My old weather station died. Dave got a wireless headset and a new CD. Both happy. I do want to say we also get rid of things on a regular basis.  Dave gets batteries wholesale sat work so we stock up on 3 lantern ones. Winter is coming...5. Eat the Food- Try NewFoods/Recipe- Ate peaches and pears oh my! Bought the new book Little Swedish Kitchen by Rachel Khoo She started off  her books on French food, then married a Swedish man, equals a new book! I did break down and bought an actual paper one! I like to actually sit down with a cookbook and read it, turn the pages, etc.  I bought several of her used French cooking books and really like her cooking style. When I looked online at some of her recipes they looked great. I like some Swedish cooking, so I thought it would be good to try. Ironically the paper copy of the book I ordered through Amazon was shipped from the UK. The only thing available in the US was electronic, oh well a sign of the digital times. I'll post some photos after I try some of the recipes.6. Build Community Food Systems- Got the free peaches. Will give our neighbor some free eggs for her rhubarb when the girls start laying.7. Recycle/Re-Use- Gifting our old medicine cabinet, old towels. I was gifted a heavy, steel file folder rack. I used it for all of my food preservation books to keep them together.8. Skill Up- Learned all about installing a shower faucet cartridge after Dave's attempt!9. Regenerate What is Lost/SalvageSomething-  Another home improvement was getting a new cartridge installed into her shower faucet control. Since it was still under warranty we got a free cartridge from Moen to replace the old one. Dave did have good directions but was unable to remove the cartridge dou to a lot of hard water build up, so we had a plumber do it. The old cartridge caused the shower faucet to drip a bit. Having the new cartridge in made a huge difference! Not only did it make the handle on the shower faucet move really easily, it actually increased the water flow. Dave thought from the sound of things that the mix probably was not correct due to the cartridge being jammed. Anyway the main thing is is it works great now! The plumber said due to hard water there was just a lot of gunk in there over the years. We're talking now about potentially adding a water softener system to the house, but don't know if we really want to spend the money for that. There's also environmental issues with all of the salt used in that. We will do more research and think about it. Will be touching up the paint on the coop soon, before the cold weather hits and reinforce a couple areas. Need to keep the girls cozy!Pear Crumble-With lots of fresh organic pears it was time to bake! I made this last year Justapinch.com but subbed Puff Pastry this time, and used nutmeg instead of cinnamon. Oh my, almost silky!"},

Dave and I were really needing a vacation since we haven't had one in several years. We didn't want to drive to Portland or  the Oregon coast since it was too far. I came up with the idea to go to Salt Lake City since it's only about a four and a half hour drive from here and there is an Ikea! I also discovered there's a wonderful University of Utah science museum with tons of huge dinosaur bones! I always loved paleontology. I think it's a great field and they have a wonderful multi level, state-of-the-art museum. We left Saturday morning and came back Monday afternoon. I took Tuesday off work to unpack, get groceries, do laundry, etc. It was nice to have the extra day off.We went to the University of Utah first Saturday afternoon after we got into town. I will say it's  one of the most beautiful campuses I've ever had the pleasure of seeing. Just gorgeous buildings and landscaping right up against the mountains. We went through the exhibits which included Native American history in the area and of course the dinosaur bones. Here's a few shots-It was really cool that they had a lab open where you could see the scientists working on their current bones-I bought a gorgeous, heavy paper botanical print for $5.00 at the gift shop! I'll get a frame locally-After that we met one of Dave's work buddies and took a tour of the office where he trained. We went out to dinner after that and crashed early. We got a great deal on a hotel S. of SLC, nice.My autumn craft in a steel Ikea plant potIkea and Park City Visit-Sunday morning we went out to breakfast and then took my long list to Ikea. I got their yearly catalog in the mail and that helped me look to see what I might use, and could afford. It's been impossible to find apple green bath towels like the ones we bought at Ikea. Ours were about 5 years old and really needed to be replaced. When we went I was told that color was being discontinued, but luckily I was able to score some. I bought bath towels and washcloths but they were out of hand towels. Luckily I went to Ikea.com and bought some there. We should be good for another four or five years! Here's a rundown, with photos from Ikea, unless otherwise noted-I love their towels as they really hold up and you won't end up with 10 lb. of lint in the dryer each time you wash them. Nice and soft! Bought 2 steel plant pots, 1 above w/cotton branches and moss from Hobby Lobby, $4.00-I bought some other miscellaneous things, a big purchase was a new medicine cabinet with a mirror for our small bathroom. Our medicine cabinet is about 10 or more years old and it's getting pretty funky looking. I've repaired it a few times but it was time to replace it. Ikea had the best price and perfect size for over my sink. The master bath is actually just a half bath which is where it will go, great deal, $89.00-I'll add an new knobI also got a solid wood step stool, I may add some blue blanket stripes, $20.00-A  lot of people \"hack\" them, my fave is this-From Pinterest, couldn't find link to post, cute paint!Other items were a large gorgeous embroidered, Swedish country folk art pillow, $25.00, my real splurge!For winter a faux sheepskin throw for my desk chair, $15.00-New duvet cover-A kids step stool for grand boys, fits perfect under our Ikea master bath cabinet, $4.00-The other items for miscellaneous kitchen supplies, $7.00 for instant thermometer-I stocked up on some dry goods in their food section, Lingon berry juice, etc. to bring home.Sunday afternoon we went to Park City, a gorgeous ski are. Home to the SLC Winter Olympics! Sadly I did not see Robert Redford. We did get to see the large ski runs off in the distance. Some closer shots of the other runs-Autumn colors starting!We had a great time, relaxed, saw some sights, shopped and spent some quality time together. Perfect trip for 3 days!Free Autumn Printables-There's a touch of Autumn in the air and I found these cute prints! Apples Eucalyptus Free Fall Printable   and Never Met A Pumpkin... I printed mine above and fit in an existing frame. I like it!!!"},

{"title": "Blue Skies & Garden Update, Chicken Escapades, New Muffuletta Sandwich Recipe, Mini Kitchen Update ", "date": "Aug 26, 2018", "text": "Blue Skies & Garden Update-Friday a nice low front blew through and brought some wind to stir up the air. Friday afternoon the smoke started to clear a bit and that was a real blessing. Saturday morning brought cooler temperatures, almost a little bit of Autumn, and bluer skies. What a relief! I'd love to see some rain, but for now it's still dry. The smoke did come back a little bit later in the day. This morning the skies are still blue with a little bit of clouds, but not bad at all.  With 50's last night, and 48 forecast for tomorrow night, Autumn is in the air! I read about this app last week that measures how smoky skies change your breathing in relation to how many cigarettes you might have smoked. Friday I smoked 2.2 cigarettes, yesterday it was 1.1. Here's an interesting article on a App That Measures Air Pollution in Cigarettes  It's free and an interesting little tool. As far as the garden update our apple tree has fruit way up, almost impossible to harvest. We are going to have a tree trimmer come in in October to work on her massive maple tree, as well as the apple tree, to trim it to a more manageable size. As far as the veggie garden production we're doing really well! Lots of tomatoes are ripening, herbs, green beans, Italian peppers, Gypsy Peppers, 2 kinds of cucumbers, and zucchini. I'm making our first salsa today since we have enough tomatoes and may start freezing some as well. There's nothing better than homegrown organic tomatoes in the middle of winter to make into soups, pasta sauce, etc. Our only fail seems to have hit everybody locally from what we have heard. With the intense heat in the 100's for a while we had very little in the way of jalapeno or bell peppers. Interestingly enough now that it has cooled down (80's) we have several small bell peppers growing, as well as jalapenos. It's pretty common knowledge that when you reach a certain temperature some vegetables will not set fruits. Tomatoes, for instance, won't set fruit if it's above 85 degrees, if I remember correctly. We have lots of pears that should be ripen in about the next month so we will harvest those. We have a small second harvest of raspberries that is trickling in which is nice. Many of our blackberries we were waiting for simply withered up in the intense heat sadly. There's always next year...Chicken Escapades-It's the case of the escaping chickens! For a while now I have found 1-3 of our new chickens out in the main part of the back yard. Annie, the white young hen, seems to be the ring leader. Sure, she’s cute but don’t let that chick fool you! I suspect after the hawk attacked, then dropped her in the boxwood shrub, she realized she could climb up it. It’s in the shade area and I’m pretty sure that’s their escape route-I have lost track of how many times Dave or I have come home from work, or looked outside, to see her/them out. Sometimes, like this week, it was all 3 birds. I trimmed all their flight feathers a bit more recently, no help. I can herd them into the coop pretty easily, but it’s a safety issue having them out. There's also potential damage to our perennial beds. The neighbor's have an aggressive dog, which made them get rid of their ducks. Safety for sure! Here's what I saw yesterday-Pru jumped up on the fence topShort jump to the compost pile and over the fence to the dogIt suddenly dawned on me two nights ago that I could but some bird netting and basically cover the shade area pretty easily. Only a $10.00 fix! We could just staple to the top of the 6’ fence, go over the Red Twig dogwood and attach to the lower fence. After I mentioned the idea to Dave he decided to reuse some of our used cedar fence boards and create a little bit of structure for that area. He pointed out that we may occasionally need to get back there and it would be easier to have something taller that we could walk under. He added strategic boards into the existing fence, and we both covered all that with bird netting and stapled it down-I'm hoping this won't have to be up there permanently. I observed this morning that one of the larger chickens lunged at one of the smaller hens and she tried to climb up the boxwood as an escape measure. She realized there was netting there and went back around behind the coop. I hope the flock dynamics will settle down over time. I don't think the older hens are actually trying to attack the little ones, it's just they're very nervous. If not it’s back to square one. Have any of you dealt with this? And poor Rosie is in a full blown molt! Lost all her tail feathers, so embarrassing! Normally you can't see where I trim their flight feathers, oh well. They'll grow back and I'm giving her extra protein treats.New Muffuletta Sandwich RecipeI was channel surfing one night and ran across a new muffuletta sandwich recipe on Cook's Country on PBS. I was used to do a lot of hand chopping lots of different ingredients to make the olive salad. This recipe uses food processor and Italian Giardiniera as the base. It also uses store-bought pizza dough to make the sandwich bread. I decided to skip that part in the interest of time with a busy weekend. I made the olive salad as directed and it came out great!It was much faster using a food processor but was still nice and chunky. You can add whatever kind of Italian meats you like and I followed their recipe but substituted Chorizo. Trader Joe's had the perfect combo for $5.00. I also added thin sliced Italian salami. Plenty of meat for 2 dinners. Here's the recipe- New Orleans MuffulettasMini Kitchen Update-With all of our garden harvesting my kitchen has been full of mixing bowls of vegetables. I realized the other day I needed to just also remove some decorative items along the kitchen counter as it was getting just too cluttered. So I pulled a few things out and moved a few things. I moved my favorite lemon topiary that I made away from the sink area over to another part of the counter,  I then replaced it with just a small Mason jar full of faux lemons and my tea sign-  I also moved our phone charger to another area-Over in my kitchen desk area I moved my other favorite topiary that I made. It's in a flour sifter and I put it on our dining table where it can be seen. That help me clear off my desk -So sometimes it only takes a few minutes to pull some things, move them, or set them aside for another part of the house. There's also also the donation box! It gives you a chance to wipe everything down and declutter, killed two birds with one stone kinds thing! I like the result and it only took me about 30 minutes!"},
{"title": "Smoky Summers- The New Normal? Fermented Pickle Results, Movie Star Maureen O'Hara's Estate Sale", "date": "Aug 20, 2018", "text": "Today in BoiseSmoky Summers- The New Normal?-We first moved to Boise in 1996, when our children were in elementary school, and they're all grown now. That gives us some perspective on what used to be normal weather here. We used to get occasional thunderstorms coming through in the summer with torrential downpours or hail. The thunderstorms that pretty much stopped except for very rare circumstances. We never had smoky skies here in the city until a few years back. The worst we had was 3 years ago when it was so smoky you could see the smoke looking down the streets. Seattle is really smoky, as are parts of Oregon, and meteorologists and scientists are saying this may be the new norm. When you have environmental issues, droughts, stupid people who light fires intentionally/accidentally, a combined with other events and fires rage. Ironically there have been very few fires in the Boise foothills this summer. Most of the fires in Californian and British Columbia are large enough that all the smoke comes into our valley. When it's nice outside and 80° you want to do something outside. All you have to do is look at the foothills, or where the foothills used to be, and say I don't think so. When you have respiratory issues and allergies it just exacerbates them even more. I've had to break down and use steroid nasal sprays because I've been so congested from this. I avoid that when possible, but wind up using them several times a week. We use a good furnace filter and we have a HEPA filter that I run all hours in our bedroom except when we sleep. You do what you can to keep the contaminants out but it always comes in anyway. I started thinking if I want to keep living in Boise long term is every summer going to look like this? Time will tell, but it's sad. I'm very grateful that we don't have any risk of fire in our city, like people in other areas.Fermented Pickle Results-Last weekend I made my first batch of Armenian fermented pickles! I checked them after 3 or 4 days, but they weren't very sour at all so I waited until today. Fermented pickles are one of those personal preference, taste choice things. The longer they ferment the more sour they will get. It's all about what tastes good to you. When I tested one this morning I was happy to see that they were crunchy! I had added a black tea tea bag in the bottom of the jar as I had read that helps with keeping the pickles from getting soggy or mushy. The flavor was good, but I think next time though I would add more garlic and more pickling spice. I strained the liquid and then put the pickles back into the fridge. It's very normal for the liquid to be murky and a lot of that will normalize after it gets cold.My fermenting kit comes with a regular plastic jar lid and so you just take the fermenting lid off and use it on top. Into the fridge they went. They will still ferment a bit more slowly and get more sour and that's fine.From The Quiet ManMovie Star Maureen O'Hara's Estate Sale-My daughter dropped by yesterday and told me a fascinating story. One of my favorite actresses from older movies, some made before I was born, was Maureen O'Hara. I didn't but about 3 years ago she moved to Boise to live with her grandson. She passed away a few years ago and she used to frequent a store called Ricochet. It's a re-sale store that specializes in furniture and home furnishings. Apparently said she and her grandson used to shop there, so her estate sale went to that store. Some of her belongings went to museums in Ireland where she was born. The sale started Friday, ran Saturday and finished yesterday. Here's the local news story- Ktvb.com  My daughter bought a pair of long leather gloves that went to her upper arms, and a leather ethnic belt that look like it was from the 70's. I dropped by the store yesterday for a few minutes and the only thing left for shoes and clothes, but lots of great photos of her. I thought it might be nice to buy a teacup and saucer, but sadly all gone. I looked at some low cut riding boots and she had very petite feet! She really had a fascinating life story and I always loved the spunky women that she portrayed. She had a interesting personal life as well and there's lots online. She is buried in Arlington National Cemetery with her 1st husband who was in the military. Loved her movies!!!!"},
{"title": "Veggie Pruning and Making Fermented Armenian Cucumber Pickles", "date": "Aug 12, 2018", "text": "Veggie Pruning & Making Fermented Armenian Cucumber Pickles-It was 103 yesterday, but woke up to 65 degrees this morning, what a relief! It's 12:30 p.m. and only 73 degrees, so much cooler. Dave did a marathon in the heat yesterday. I told him to wait til this morning when it would be cooler, but he was a man on a mission! He did a heavy pruning of the tomatoes vines with no fruit and tied them up more-Yesterday you couldn't see the soil it was so overgrown!Cuke vines tied up on the fence now, were all over the ground before Ditto our HUGE Italian peppers bending over to the ground, he had to stake them up again. It's always good to cut any non-productive vines out, to let the existing fruit have more sun to ripen, and let more water in. We watered heavily last night and the garden looks so much better! We'll be fertilizing the tomatoes today as well. Fast growers need lots of food...Last weekend I ran across some small Armenian Cucumbers. I thought they would be great, but wasn't that familiar with them. I googled them and there are tons of recipes out there. I always have trouble finding nice pickling cukes here locally. They're either bad, bruised, slimy or just none to buy. Maybe next year I will grow my own. I bought a bag and today started making some fermented pickles. I combined the two recipes below to see how they would come out. I put in small, fresh dill since I couldn't find any heads to buy locally. It smells great, so it should work well for the pickles and I've used that before instead of the heads. For some reason dill is something I can never grow here and I have no idea why, must be the soil? So I basically added a small package of organic fresh dill, 3 large cloves fresh garlic, 1 tablespoon of black peppercorns, 1 teaspoon of celery seed, 1 teaspoon of mustard seed, and 1 black tea bag in the bottom (for tannins/crunch)-The rest is just 2 sliced up yellow Gypsy peppers from the garden, and the sea salt and water-I was disappointed when I opened up the bag of cucumbers that they were getting a little slimy so I scrubbed them really well and cut off any bad spots. It was my own fault that I didn't process them last weekend since I forgot to buy the dill! I'm sure they'll be fine and fermented pickles tend to be a little softer anyway. My fermenting jar with weights works great on anything with the water lock-I have used this fermenting jars for several years and LOVE IT! It's a half gallon w/ceramic weights-                                                               A water lock lets the gasses escape but keeps the bad bacteria out. I put the crock on my kitchen counter, covered, and will keep an eye on them-Soon to be pickles!!!I wanted to add- this is so much FASTER than canning (unless you eat gallons per year) AND you get the healthy probiotics. Once you get the flavor you want, you just put them in a jar and refrigerate, they'll keep a long time. Recipes here and you can certainly modify as needed. The salt/water ratio is KEY. Phickle.com and Fermented Pickles w/Tea"},
{"title": "110 Record High and Still Harvesting, Review Hello Fresh Meals", "date": "Aug 11, 2018", "text": "110 Record High & Still Harvesting-Yesterday was an all-time record high of 110! It's just SO HOT there's no way around that. I'm working every day on keeping the chickens cooler by giving them cool snacks and treats, running the mister, watering the coop/run area well. We're both watering the gardens, trees and grass. We're still harvesting as things are picking up production in the garden. We got a couple of really big zucchinis, more tomatoes, 2 kinds of peppers. We're getting more cucumbers as well, slicing and Lemon-Almost Pesto time!Herbs growing like crazy!The chickens are still laying, but not that much. We get one egg every day or two. The smoke from the forest fires combined, with the heat, that is a bit much. My allergies are crazy! Today I woke up and there was a little bit of clouds in the sky, hoping that would move some of the smoke out. It's 10 degrees cooler today, only 98! Terrible smoke still. I'm ready for Autumn!Hawaiian Poke BowlReview Hello Fresh MealsLast week I showed some photos of the Hello Fresh two dinners/for two people package that I got.Hello Fresh Delivery They did a great job packaging everything and here's my review of the actual meals themselves.With the Hawaiian Poke Bowl there was a little bit of dishonest advertising on their photo. It showed shaved coconut but in reality the coconut I received was almost like a granular coconut. Very small.One thing about these meal, you use a lot of bowls to prep! Maybe it's just the way I cook, but I don't usually use 5 bowls to make one meal. The directions were pretty clear and instructions definitely made for novices. After I put all of the ingredients together, cooked the chicken and assemble the meal here's my verdict. I'm not that familiar with traditional Hawaiian foods and so maybe it's supposed to be pretty bland, but it was. I think I would have added a lot more ginger and maybe even some garlic? I don't know if that's traditional would have given it a lot more flavor. It looked better than it tasted, although the lime rice was great! I can see doing this homemade, basically making a large batch of rice, meat, nuts, and seasoned raw vegetables and then assembling for several meals. It is definitely not something I would make again as far as their recipe.The second recipe was the Pork Poblano Tacos which I made last night. Sorry no photos. The ingredients were fine, everything all listed, but they forgot the poblano pepper! Pretty funny since it's supposed to be a poblano tacos. Since that was missing I used one large Italian pepper, wasn't quite the same. I also added a sweet Gypsy pepper. I had a feeling it was going to be really bland so I added maybe half a teaspoon, or less, of Chipotle powder. I was kind of surprised that the kiwi salsa recipe did not include a jalapeno pepper? Since I had our own home-grown right tomato I did use ours instead of theirs. One of the other things I noticed was that the kiwi they shipped was definitely not ripe. Probably shipping some of these kinds of produce you're going to have under ripe fruits or vegetables. Again the directions were clear, but the meal was basically pretty bland. Considering how many ingredients were in it, it didn't have much flavor. I did email Hello Fresh right away and said- \"Hey, no poblano pepper, really?\" They emailed me back within an hour and said they would give me $1.35 credit. Since I've already closed my account it can just sit there.So my review is- Overall very well organized, well marked and shipped well. Lot's of menus to choose from. Maybe their general menu mode is to go for blander/middle of road flavors,without the punch. The addition of something with more flavor to the Poke Bowl would have made a huge difference, and the tacos as well. So if shopping is an issues, you're learning to cook, or you're experimenting, you could give it a try it. For me, I'll pass. I'll keep the menus and make again, with more flavorful ingredients, and save a lot by shopping locally. And less bowls too!"},
{"title": "Blue Skies & Cooler, Homemade Chokecherry Syrup, 1st Home Grown Salad, Hello Fresh Delivery, New Chickens Update", "date": "Aug 4, 2018", "text": "Squirrel cooling off near mister in 100+ degree weatherBlue Skies and Cooler! Weather that was forecast a day or two ago turned out to be right! We had a nice cool front that came in off the Pacific Ocean and seem to move almost all the smoke out of the area and cool us down. Whenever I hear low pressure this time of year I do a happy dance. Low means cooler and sometimes wind which can be great in this kind of situation. We've been watering and watering to keep everything alive and the triple temperatures. Anya still loves laying in the sun, even with the heat, the weirdo-It was a really nice to be in, and out, of the house and do little projects. Here's some random projects I tackled....Dave and I wound up having the same identical eyeglasses cases from Costco, which caused some confusion. I started thinking of a way I could put something colorful on mine. I decided not to buy anything, but instead pulled out some nice blue and white French plaid ribbon. A few cuts, a little liquid nails and I can certainly tell now which one is mine!I also made some chokecherry jelly today syrup, see below.  Hard boiled some fresh eggs in my little Egglette cups, works brilliant! Time for deviled eggs, yum. We went out to a late lunch at Kilted Kod, a food truck that has the best fish and chips I've ever had anywhere. They use big, juicy chunks of Cod, handmade and cooked to order. Very light and crunchy batter, just incredible. According to local people from the U.K. it's very authentic. After lunch we stopped at Goodwill and found an amazing gift for one of our grandchildren. While I don't think my kids usually read this blog I'm not going to post what it is until after we give it to him. But it was an amazing score!Tonight we sat on the back porch and just enjoyed the cooler weather. We have a couple of hummingbirds that come to our feeders on a regular basis. We have two and every three to four days I mix up new hummingbird food. Basically it's three parts water and one part sugar dissolved well and cooled. We have lots of plants that are blooming now to also provide natural food. The smoke started rolling in a bit this afternoon, but at least it's cooler, breezy and the smoke is much less than it was. Forecast for some possible rain tonight! Praying for NO lightning! We have enough fires as it is.Homemade Chokecherry Syrup-I was thinking we would have a really nice harvest of Chokecherries this year to make more jelly with. In the past we've had a Qt or more. I have made some jelly before and it has a wonderful citrus type flavor and beautiful color. Dave picked everything off the shrub and sadly there was only about one cup total of chokecherries.With that small amount I decided to just make a very small batch of syrup for pancakes and waffles. Basically you clean the choke cherries, cover with a little bit of water and bring to a boil and simmer until they're soft. I was lucky these chokecherries were actually very juicy!After you boil them you pour the liquid and chokecherries through a sieve. I took a big, flat metal spoon and pushed the chokecherries and the juice through the strainer into a bowl-I worked on that for about a good 5 to 10 minutes until there was some juice in the bottom along with some pulp. I had a little trouble deciphering how much sugar to put into such a small amount of juice. I wound up with it a little bit too sweet so I added some store-bought boysenberry syrup. I brought that to a boil as well with the sugar. Then I poured that back through the strainer another time and was able to get more chokecherry juice out of the mix. I wound up with a half small jelly batch-It's a tart version of boysenberry syrup, but hey it does have a lot of vitamin C! We'll hope for a better harvest next year. I'm really happy at least we have lots and lots of apples and pears on the trees.Recipe here Mennonitegirlscancook1st Home Grown Salad- We had our first nice summer garden salad with homegrown tomatoes, Lemon and slicing cukes and basil, added some chunks of avocado, red wine vinegar and olive oil, above. Our daughter Angie stopped by, gifting us with three HUG yellow squash and one big cuke. We'll be eating those!We have some small zuccini almost ready. Looking forward to more fresh tomatoes to make some salsa.Hello Fresh Delivery-Today I got the test order from Hello Fresh in the mail. I haven't cooked the two meals yet but here's a preview of what I got and how they shipped it-The box came very well insulated with cellulose packing material as well as two small and two very large ice bags-The upper two bags of food whole nice and cold-The two meat packages were down in the bottom next to a frozen ice bag also very very cold.There were materials inside on how to cook each of the meals as well as photos of the finished product-Great directions if you don't know how to cook I'm cooking this first!I bought these with a $50 off coupon so the total for two meals for two people was $15. $15.00 for four meals, not bad! I can cook from scratch cheaper, but this was a treat/experiement. We will definitely reuse the four ice bags, especially the two really large ones. We're going on a road trip soon and those will be great to put in the cooler since they are huge. As soon as I cook those meals I will post a review, but the ingredients look really great! Watch for more updates!New Chickens Update-The three new chickens are working out really. They got to free-range with the 2 big hens tonight and they all had a great time. All very healthy and curious and the flock pecking order seems to be settled in. While they do tend to run away from the two big hens, for no particular reason, probably just from sheer size. Annie, the white hen is definitely the braver of the three and seems to be the natural leader. It will be interesting over time to see if she butts heads with Rosie, the big Red Rhode Island Red. She's been the dominant hen for quite a while now, so time will tell."},
{"title": "Hot And Smoky, Peach Fail, Independence Days Challenge  ", "date": "Jul 31, 2018", "text": "Hot And Smoky-Like the rest of the West it's been very hot, with triple digits and smoke from various wildfires. We're fortunate that the smoke isn't any worse. The sunsets have been really spectacular, but I've been sneezing a lot more, congested, with all of the crud in the air. There's no relief in sight for the heat right now but the good news the vegetables are going great! I mostly just trying to keep the chickens cool and we're trying to stay on top of the watering. This is the time of year I'm really grateful for air conditioning in our home, my car, and my job. Could be much much worse. I feel really sad with people losing their homes, businesses and the forests. It's a terrible sight to see the Shasta area fire, huge and such a gorgeous area. I visited there a long time ago and Mt. Shasta was breaktaking. Morning commute 2 days ago, much worse todayYep, that's itPeach Fail-This is our second year to have peaches off our little peach tree and it was doing great this spring. We had lots of fruit and then a few storms blew through. I had noticed that there weren't a whole lot of peaches on the side facing the street, but didn't think much of it until this weekend. Dave told me that a lot of the peaches were ripe and he was going to pick them. I asked him how much he thought there was on the tree and he thought a couple of crates. In reality we had a pretty tiny harvest as you can see from the photo. Pretty sad, but I guess it's better than nothing. We had lots of one gallon bags in the freezer from last year's harvest in comparison. I took the worst of the peaches that were bruised and have some bruises,  sliced those up and made a peach and blueberry cobbler. I saved the better more perfect peaches for us to just eat fresh. We gave a small bag to our two daughters last night and her one grand baby was asking for more peaches! Glad that he likes them. So unlike last winter we won't have lots of frozen peaches. Oh well, what can you do?Independence Days Challenge-Here's a rundown of what we've been up to lately...1. Plant Something- I was able to find some half price Italian parsley since mine died and planted some fresh. This is not the time of year for planting for us since it's so hot and we don't do a fall garden due to the climate.2. Harvest Something-Right now we're harvesting the start of our tomatoes, lemon/slicing cucumbers, blackberries, and sweet Gypsy peppers. We got about 1 cup of Choke Cherries, that's it. I'll make some syrup for breakfast and stick it in the fridge. Our two older hens are still laying about 1 egg every day or so probably due to the excessive heat. We're doing a lot to keep them cool, but I think that their production will pick up a little bit as it cools down some over time. Interestingly enough the three half-size hens seem to tolerate the heat better probably because they're smaller.3. Preserve/Store Something- We harvested our neighbor's rhubarb (she doesn't use it) and we got about four 1-gallon bags in the freezer. I also made a huge strawberry rhubarb apple cobbler last weekend! Yummy. No peaches this year, read below. Looking forward to harvesting apples and pears, the trees are loaded! I think we'll have enough tomatoes to freeze as well.4. Manage Reserves- Get a GoodDeal/Barter/Stock Up/Prep- Bought grilling chicken on sale for roasting. Going to Costco soon for some supplements, cat litter etc. We get lots of great deals there, but we're careful what we buy.5. Eat the Food- Try NewFoods/Recipe- After I read a little article on how the English royal family stays healthy I discovered barley water! I never heard of it before and did a little research. It's made out of water left over from cooking with barley and added fruit juices for flavoring. And guess what I stumbled upon at a local grocery store? Yes lemon flavored barley water. Always ready for a culinary adventure I decided to buy a bottle. It was $7 for the concentrate of 28 Oz. Basically you use about 80% water in about 20% of the concentrate, so it makes a lot of glasses. I tried it and really liked it since it was tart and didn't have much sugar compared to other drinks. Dave even liked it! I bought Robinson's brand lemon flavor and may try some other flavors if I can find them. While this isn't something I would have ordered online, I did find it locally. I may buy some more or make my own. There are tons of recipes online. You basically cook barley, reserve the water and then add your own fruit flavorings. Fascinating stuff!6. Build Community Food Systems-Rhubarb from her neighbor, Dave nicely sliced it up in cubes, froze it bagged. We gave her a dozen of our fresh eggs which she greatly appreciated.7. Recycle/Re-Use-Mostly doing more donations and I have bought a few used things recently. I picked up a few inexpensive summer clothes for work and some bamboo silicone utensils for pots.In a recent order from Amazon I received a $50 off coupon for Hellofresh, a new meal delivery system. After going online and doing a little research I went ahead and ordered two two-person dinners. The total will be $15 which would certainly be less than the two of us eating out. All the ingredients are provided except for simple additions like oil, butter or something else that you would usually have on hand. We should be receiving the order this weekend and I will do a review. I ordered a Hawaiian Poke Bowl meal and Pork Tacos. I will certainly let you know what I think after we try this if anyone is interested. While I think they target affluent families that don't know how to cook, maybe they'll learn something! I guess no one buys cook books any more.8. Skill Up-I did learn recently how to air out a perfume a smelly used leather purse. My one main leather purse that I use mostly for work was partially broken. It was a used leather Fossil bag that I bought on eBay a few years ago. I wasn't able to fix part of the metal that broke. I found another good deal on eBay for another Fossil bag that was basically brand-new, much cheaper than retail. I was really excited then I opened up the box and about fell over from the perfume odor. Since I am sensitive to odors it might not have been as bad for somebody else, but it was bad enough for me. The bag came in a cloth storage bag which I immediately threw out since I really didn't want it. I was happy to see that simply airing out the purse in another bedroom by hanging it on a closet knob seems to have fixed the problem. Interestingly enough there are tons of DIY ideas online on how to do this.9. Regenerate What is Lost/SalvageSomething-I can't really think of something that we salvaged recently although we do little things all the time. Dave did pull out the dishwasher arm and I cleaned it out so maybe that qualifies? As much as we scrape dishes it seems like little bits of food are always getting clogged in the spinning wands. I told Dave if he dies first I'm having the dishwasher removed, recycled, then I will have someone build some nice shelving there and fill it with baskets. With two of us (unless we have company) we really only run the dishwasher every two days."},
{"title": "DIY Upcycled Thrifted Camping & Summer Decor ", "date": "Jul 20, 2018", "text": "DIY Upcycled  Thrifted Camping & Summer Decor-Lately I had been seeing a ton of camping related decor on Pinterest. Some were decked out trailers, tents or porches. I also spotted a few inside home camping decor ideas (see my Pinterest folder). We haven't had a real vacation for a few years and I remembered how much we used to love tents camping with the girls. I took some items I already had (except the sign) and decked out my dining room shelf! I started with the Thermos which previously had flags for 4th of July. I went around the house and gathered the other things- A mini red oil lantern (that works!), a small white enameled basin with a blue edge, a blue coffee kettle (added fake flowers), a Brownie camera, a fish print from one of our girls (turned side ways), a tree branch I collected from McCall with moss, and an old camping mug that had a candle inside. I thought about aading a compass, but it's buried in the garage. I've also seen a string of wood fake fish, you could do all kinds of things! I liked it! I did splurge and spend about $6.00 on the Relax You're At The Lake sign from Hobby Lobby (with coupon). I felt it tied it together and here's a closer look-Reminiscing Dave and I decided to go to the lake area we love outside Bend, Oregon next summer and stay at the lodge. Looking forward to it, and a bed and a shower sounds great!For the main part of the house I always put out some season decor, now it's beach and summer items. Many of these items are thrifted or handmade!Entertainment center, made the moss ball, green candle holder a gift from my girlsBeach table Free online vintage print, thrifted frame  Thrifted power line insulators, dollar store birdhouses I paintedVintage thrifted Ball jar with our sea shellsThrifted candle holder and lighthouseKinetic dolphins \"swim\"!Thrifted seagull, shells, fake netting Polished up the sun catchers from last weekends yard sale, will hang outsideKitchen windowThrifted frame, you can rotate and it changes the shells!"},
{"title": "A Man's Life Saved & His Yard Sale, My Own Close Call, It Pays To Call City Hall, Blackberry Cake", "date": "Jul 18, 2018", "text": "A Man's Life Saved & His Yard Sale-This is a pretty unusual story, so bear with me because there's a good payoff at the end! Dave came home late Saturday morning and yelled at me in the kitchen I have something that you've always wanted that I found, but don't look yet. I was scratching my head wondering what he could possibly be talking about? I closed my eyes and he came around the corner with a wind vane. I looked at it, looked at him, and said okay? He said well this is the one that you've driven by for years that you always wanted. Still scratching my head, trying to figure out what he was talking about he then described the house where he found it. It turned out there was a large yard sale at the house of an elderly gentleman in our neighborhood that was there for years. I explained which house had the wind vane that I had always admired. Then I remembered.He told me quite a story that he had heard from the elderly man's neighbor. His wife died years ago and he was left alone, but his sweet neighbors helped take care of him. He was diabetic, had terrible cataracts, was basically blind and wasn't doing very well in general. It really broke my heart to hear this man suffered for so long by himself after his neighbors moved away. We had seen the house deteriorate terribly over the 10 plus years we lived in the neighborhood. The yard was getting overgrown, and it looked like they used to have a nice yard. Health and Welfare got involved and deemed the house uninhabitable and the man was moved to Assisted Living. He got cataract surgery and now can see! He had been looking terribly with a cane and everyone thought he needed a hip replacement. He did some physical therapy and came back really well and now is walking without a cane!!!All in all a good outcome since he is 81 years old and now has a chance to live some years where he is being helped, treated and is not alone.  It's a good reminder that sometimes little things we do for each other in our community can be huge. It could be the difference between life and death for someone else. We went back to the yard sale later that afternoon. I just wanted to look and see if there was any little things there that I might want. It was really hard to believe, until you saw it, that the man may have had psychiatric issues, and was potentially a hoarder. He had boxes and boxes and boxes of new items still in the box scattered throughout his house and garage. He had multiple hand tools, power tools, all kinds of things, all brand new in the box piled everywhere. I found a couple small items that I liked and for a whopping $5 we bought a cute little cow creamer, a couple of metal sun catchers, and a new still in the box wind-up clock- Info here on these  Cow-creamers.netFor when the zombies comeDave wound up paying $5 for the wind vane and mounted it on top of the coop where we can see it and enjoy it. In the spring I will repaint the deer which should be dark brown. I was actually able to find the same wind vane online and it's made in America in Michigan! Dave leveled it and balanced it and it moves freely.I would like to think that the elderly gentleman would appreciate the fact we're renewing some old things that he had and enjoying them. God bless him.My Own Close Call-Monday night we had a terrible thunderstorm with very, very high winds blowing through. I was watching the radar because I wasn't sure if I needed to take the half-hens and two large hens into the coop or not. I realized when the wind finally kicked up really hard and I went outside. I heard a loud crack when I stepped out. I thought it was a neighbor's tree? I didn't see anything. My best guess as to the wind speed (been through these before) was about 65 miles an hour. I went out into the veggie garden area and was able to get the three small chicks in the coop. I was going to get the two large hens inside and close the door. At that point a very large branch came crashing down on top of me somehow missing my head-It was wide and long. Yesterday we looked and we still can't tell where it came from but apparently was very, very high up in the tree. We love our huge maple tree in the backyard giving us shade but sometimes it does occasionally lose a branch. When the branch hit the ground somehow it did not actually hit me except for a light bump on the top of my head. The main branch was medium sized and you can see it in the picture with Dave above. When it first came crashing down my automatic instinct was to duck and cover my head. Dave had seen the branch come down through the living room picture window. He thought it had knocked me down and came running out of the house. I stood up and yelled at him to help me get the two chickens in their coop, which we did. At that point I had had enough and went inside and Dave started to get the branch out of the vegetable area and into the main yard-It took me quite a while to calm down. He came back in a few minutes later. The miracle is I literally did not have a scratch on me. I think it would have been different if this it happened in the winter with no leaves on the tree. I probably would have gotten pretty scraped up. It's also a miracle it didn't take out the fence, the coop, or our newly-installed wind vane. The vegetables actually survived pretty well too! So this is why you buy life insurance, as I later reminded Dave, ha ha. It could have been much worse, so I am grateful!Ready for the compost binIt Pays To Call City Hall-Sometimes you drive by something every day and don't notice when things go bad. There are two really long traffic islands I drive by every day on the way to work going down a long hill. I can't really tell you how long they are. The islands had been a nice touch of green in the road with trees, shrubs and flowers. It was obvious that they had a drip irrigation system built in and everything look good. Early this summer I noticed that there were weeds in the beds that we're getting pretty tall. At one point, with the heat, I realized that all the trees had turned brown. I drove by a few more days and realized that things looked pretty bad. I called the Ada County Highway District to let them know what I was seeing, only to be told to call the Parks and Recreation District. I called them and was told to call another agency. I laughed at that point and told a woman well I guess I'm going to have to call someone else. She kindly told me that she would take care of that. I didn't think much more about it until later that week. I noticed that several of the dead trees have been cut down and the weeds were being removed. Within about one week we had brand new healthy trees, shrubs, and bark dust. I took a photo as safe as I could do while driving. Nice improvement, a little bit of green to drive by and just shows that it does sometimes pay to call City Hall! So much nicer of you than dead trees and weeds. Adds a little urban habitat for birds, etc., too.Recipe and photo from Realsimple.comBlackberry Cake-We've been slowly eating the blackberries that we have been harvesting instead of freezing them. I've made this recipe before and it's just so delicious that I decided to buy some blackberries. I found this recipe in a magazine several years ago and it migrated online. I found a good deal locall- three containers for $5, perfect for my recipe. This is really simple and you do not need a food processor to make the batter! I simply cut the butter, added all the dry ingredients and cut cut cut cut. Added the rest of the wet ingredients, etc. and put it in the pan. We did add a few of our own blackberries and raspberries period on the top, then add the crumble and into the oven it went. This is such a great recipe because it's not too sweet and it's really super moist. Try it you'll like it!"},
{"title": "Independence Days Challenge", "date": "Jul 14, 2018", "text": "Here's a snapshot of what we've been up to lately! It's still hot, around high 90's/100 degrees, just more summer!1. Plant Something-Recently I planted some mint for tea and cool salads. I bought some Italian Parsley seeds (mine died) and Calendula seeds. I also bought a perennial for an empty spot in the backyard- Sweet MintLittle Cutie Blondie Coral Bells, good for shady spot, Poesy eating in backWater Lettuce pond plants multiplyingWe are done planting for the year, unless I find more random veggies on sale 75% off!2. Harvest Something-Our vegetable garden is looking really good, we have tons of green tomatoes, peppers, etc. We have harvested our first sweet Gypsy peppers, blackberries, raspberries and some of the first ripening Marion berries. From the chickens we are also harvesting eggs! Here's a snap shot of the backyard-Gypsy peppersZucchinitomatoesTons of lemon cukes blossomsNasturtiums I planted from seedPotatoes almost ready2 volunteer tomatoes in the cold frameFail- No radishes, but edible greens, not enough sun sadly, no carrots  lesson learnedMonster Italian KaleThe three new chicks are doing really well and getting bigger by the day. I watched a snippet of Lord of the Rings the other day and thought of the and heard the phrase halflings, I think I'll call them half-hens!They're getting along with the two older hens and are sharing the coop really well. They found out how to get up to the very top roost in the coop. The other night they were all on the top and weren't bothering each other. They took a little while to realize that there was more to the chicken run that just a little square area, so they are exploring more. I let them out today into the main backyard with Dave's help-babies first field triplooking at Dave pruning raspberries, whatcha doing?The other 2 came out to play as well-EllieEllie and RosieI've trained all of our hens three basic commands of let's go outside, let's go inside, and do you want some food? Going outside means going out in the yard, going inside means going back into the coop or run, and are you hungry means I have a snack! My wintered-over geraniums are blooming great-3. Preserve/Store Something-Will be harvesting some rhubarb former neighbors Garden that she likes to give us so I'll be freezing all of that. Too early for anything else. Canning will proceed when the peaches, apples and pears ripen. My Curtido is ready, I pulled out and re-jarred and into the fridge it went-Homemade goodnessWhen I find some pickling cukes I'll ferment some of those too!4. Manage Reserves- Get a GoodDeal/Barter/Stock Up/Prep-Got a great deal on some work dress slacks at the Eddie Bauer outlet with a $10 off coupon, for a total of $5.00!  I got a nice work blouse on eBay, clearance one on LL Bean, bought a pair of heavy leather sandals from Skechers for everyday use. My last pair lasted 3 years so that worked out pretty well, much cheaper than Birks-I found this cute garden stake at Hobby Lobby clearance priced, $6.00, will go with the new plant, sort of a faux mini gazing ball with a chicken on top!My $7.00 mister finally died, so we found this to replace it, has 2 misters instead of one, $12.00-The mister is outside, hens are loving it since it's 95 degrees.5. Eat the Food- Try NewFoods/Recipe-I've made this recipe for years and made some last weekend, Spicy Fried Chicken It's a pretty simple recipe and the buttermilk is key! I served it with homemade corn relish, salad w/homemade buttermilk dressing, green onions, and red pickled onions. I found this new free recipe from Bonappetit.com, looks good and love all the lime juice-Spicy Ranch Sauce1 cup mayonnaise1 cup sour cream1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro6 tablespoons fresh lime juice4 green onions, finely chopped2 tablespoons minced seeded jalapeno pepper1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper6. Build Community Food Systems-Will be harvesting some rhubarb from our neighbor's garden that she gives us every year, will be selling eggs once the three half-hens start laying. Most hens start laying around 5 to 6 months old which should put our girls into October or so. I should have plenty to sell!7. Recycle/Re-Use-I filled up both our hummingbird feeders are they getting used! Dave got some old cedar boards from one of our girls a while back. They had some really tall planters they inherited when they bought their house that they didn't like, so Dave salvaged them. I'll have him build a small planter box for me this/next weekend so I can plant my new seeds. We took donations to the thrift store, shoes, clothes and household items. I bought some used baseballs for $2.00 for a craft project but wound up liking them as-is in my basin!Summer decor!I found another booster chair for one of the grand kids, since they're too big for a high chair, $5.00. I will sell the high chair on Craigslist. Thrifting seems to come in waves and I haven't been buying much lately, and that's ok.  I'm currently re-purposing some things for a new display, will post soon!8. Skill Up-I learned about how the Juror calling system works in Boise since I was on jury duty for the week of July 4th. You just call in every night the night before and listen to see if they pull your number. I didn't get called since they didn't call any jurors at all for 3 days. Then on the other my number wasn't called. I wouldn't have minded doing it since I believe that's a part of being a citizen.9. Regenerate What is Lost/Salvage Something-Ditto the cedar boards."},
{"title": "100 Degrees, Hawk Attack! Sweet Hot Pickled Red Onion, Making Corn Relish", "date": "Jul 6, 2018", "text": "100 Degrees-Well summer is finally here and so is the heat! It was 100 yesterday and 80 degrees at 10:30 a.m. this morning. Now it's water, water, water. We added more compost to our beds to keep the soil moist, really helps. I'm very grateful we also have A/C and lots of ceiling fans. We dress for the weather and stay hydrated. Kept the chickens cool with the little mister. Both the hens stood right under it yesterday. I hosed down the chick area where they like to hang out. Pretty cool. The veggies are really taking off in the garden and the heat will help. And hey, I can make sun tea!Sadly the fires have started too. Many fires were started on the 4th from fireworks, and there was a grass fire in the foothills yesterday. The sky was smoky in parts last night, at times obscuring the sun, but it's gone this morning thankfully. So we're staying cool and enjoying the summer. Image from Eastsideaudubon.orgHawk Attack! You know how every thing's going really well and something happens that is so bizarre you stand back and think did that really happen?  Two days ago the chicks were outside having a good time and I was in the kitchen with the sliding glass door open. It was pretty quiet, the weather was great. I heard a terrible terrible, blood-curdling peeping from one of the chicks. I wasn't sure if one of the hens was attacking one, a cat or what was going on. I threw open the door and ran outside. As I was coming out off the deck I could see something long and low, jet black at the base of our garden gate going into the veggie area, was it a cat or? After getting closer coming off the deck a huge hawk flew up over our maple tree. When the hawk flew off it went and landed on our neighbor's tree behind us. I went into the garden, saw only two chicks and just had a terrible thought that the hawk had taken one. Annie the white chick was missing-I thought well, that's it, the hawk took the chick. Then I heard another terrible peeping and looked around the yard. Annie was in the top of a boxwood shrub in the shade area, on the other side of the coop. I ran over there I was able to get her out of the shrub- Round boxwood shrub She was shaking like a leaf and peeping wildly. Poor thing was terrified. I checked her and didn't see any blood or any puncture marks. I took her back into the main part of the garden, closed the gate and put her down on the ground to see if she was okay. She seemed fine, but all three of the chicks ran and hid in a corner. I grabbed a lawn chair and brought it inside the gate so I was only a few feet from them and sat down. I didn't see the hawk at that point but when I looked up it was soaring over us. The chicks kept looking at me and I think they seemed comforted by my being near, and they all fell asleep.Mantling Behavior from Hiveminer.comHawks spread their wings out to cover their prey when they first catch it. That's called mantling, then they eat. I learned this being a volunteer at the local Birds Of Prey Center.  It was low to the ground in front of the gate, just flat. When I came out and the hawk flew away I think it dropped Annie due to her size or weight into the maple tree. I suspect that she tumbled down through the tree, then landed in the shrub directly below. I think if she had hit the dirt directly she probably would have died from the fall. I stayed with them for about an hour or so and just make sure that the hawk didn't come back. Hopefully I startled it enough that it won't come back, but that's the risk you take. It had really black top wing feathers and I called the Bird of Prey Center. With it's coloring and size they thought it was probably a Swainson's Hawk. I had looked up the Sharp-Shinned Hawks that I know we have in the neighborhood, but they are smaller. So all in all everything came out okay. I'm just glad I was home and heard things or it might have been a much different outcome.Sweet Hot Pickled Red Onion-Speaking of food projects I decided to make some of these wonderful that red onion rings. I heard this recipe on the radio years ago, made some and it's a really versatile side dish. You can put it on top of salads, eat on crackers, lots you can do with it. Just follow the simple directions here and you could double or triple the batch if you like Splendidtable.org. The limes juices basically works like a pickling acid. I do like a little less heat, so I use Jalapenos, and skip the mint. A mandolin made quick work of this. This recipe made 2 packed Qts. Yummy!Making Corn Relish-Here's another fun summer cold side dish! I didn't make this last summer and regretted it, so I made some now. It's pretty simple, you basically drop all the ingredients into a pot and simmer. It keeps in the refrigerator for quite a few weeks since it's basically in a vinegar base. Some people do can this as well, lots of info out there. Since I don't grow my own corn I just use canned (horrors!) and make enough for the 2 of us. You can certainly make a quadruple batch. All three of my adult kids really love this recipe! The first time I gave some to my one daughter she said she sat down with a spoon and ate an entire quart jar! Too much acid for my tummy. Anyway it's simple and you could add all kinds of other veggies- tomatoes, cukes, hot peppers, etc. I started to chop the red onion and up came the fumes! I forgot to chill the onion, that cuts down on the tears. So I got out my manual mini veggie Chef'n chopper-I chunked up the onion, put inside, pulled the handle about 8-10 xs, and had finely diced onion, no more tears! I HIGHLY recommend this chopper, VERY sharp, small and works fast. $19.99 on Amazon, click on photo for more info. So here's the version I came up with after reading multiple recipes online-Recipe-5 cans corn (I used low sodium) and the juice, or fresh or frozen1 each chopped- red bell pepper and green bell pepper1 tablespoon kosher salt1 cup white sugar1 teas. celery seed1 teas. mustard seed1 teas. Turmeric1 large diced red onion2 cups apple cider vinegarPut everything into a large pot, stir well, and bring to a boil. Lower the heat and simmer for 1 hour. Cool, then transfer to jars and refrigerate. This recipe made about four Qts. I really like making these kinds of recipes from scratch and add to my cold 'pantry'."},

{"title": "Vacation Day = Project Time! Keeping Chickens Cool in The Heat", "date": "Jul 2, 2018", "text": "Vacation Day = Project Time!I had today off as a vacation time day which meant project time! There were a few different projects I wanted to do. Some of them were little, some of them larger, but all of them take time. With gardening season full blown we are really busy on the weekends. We also do periodic babysitting for our grandchildren. We love them and are happy to to help. Since I knew I'd be off today we went and saw Ocean's 8 yesterday, great movie! So here we go...Shelf Wood Finishing- One of the projects I wanted to do today was finishing our corner hall unit that Dave built DIY Floating Corner Shelves. I looked around for quite a few ideas about finishing the shelves, but decided to live with them as-is until summer. Using any kind of paint or varnish etc., would have really smelled up the house in the winter. I thought about paint, stain and wasn't sure if we wanted to keep them light or dark. Both Dave and I really like the natural wood look and so I found Watco Danish Oil which is a one-step finish. Got it at a big box store for about $10.00. It's oil-based product that protects the wood and is very easy to apply-I went with Natural since that we didn't want a really big color change in the wood. We have a nice light wall color in the hallway and I didn't want to go dark since we're going for a bright airy look in the house. First I removed the decorative items and dusted well-bare woodPut on first coat, 'flooding the wood' per directions-Rubbed in well with 2 folded up paper towels-1st coatNext let sit 20 minutes, then did a 2nd coat-Let sit another 15 minutes, wipe off the excess, it was easy! It has a mild smell, not bad compared to poly, etc. Darkened the wood just a bit, nice luster. I used less than 1/3 the bottle, so more left for other projects. I didn't need to tarp, just careful, washed my hands, came right off with Dawn.  Loving it! I let it sit overnight, then added back the decor.Why I call this a projectCurtido- Another project was to make some Curtido, a Salvadoran spicy sauerkraut. It's amazing and so healthy! Post here Curtido Making . FYI, I use pickling salt, but you could change that. It's easy to make but it's a bit labor-intensive, using a mandolin to slice a lot of cabbage, carrots, onions (and dice any leftovers), season, and add salt to ferment. Then there's the clean up! I leave the diced jalapenos out, it's spicy enough for us!  I weighed the veggies before starting, simpler to gauge the salt amount. I bought this inexpensive OXO Mandolin a year or 2 ago, and it works great for this!!! Small and easy/safe to store. Perfect for recipes when you need something sliced very uniform. For $14.99 it's perfect, has 3 adjustments for thickness, and it's razor sharp-Making Curtido is really worth it, since it lasts for several months in your fridge once it ferments. It is really great for your tummy, tons of probiotics. You can ferment for several months, but I wait about 10-14 days, and great as is. I'm sure it would have a deeper flavor if you went longer. The flavor is really amazing, not just spicy, but very aromatic as well. I will ferment some pickles this summer once I find some pickling cucumbers locally. I have a good fermenting jar that I use and it works perfect for these applications simple and easy. Recipe here- Curtido Spicy Fermented SauerkrautNot done yetDonations- Another project was just getting some donations together to drop off at a thrift store. Sometimes you keep things because you think you're going to use them. Or you keep things because you're just emotionally attached to them. I had two pair of nice, expensive clogs that I used to wear at my old library job when I was on my feet all day. I thought about selling them on eBay but frankly I thought it would be more fun to throw a little something expensive into a thrift store donation bag! Some lucky person will find them, works for me. Adding some other things and dropping off tomorrow, since I won't have jury duty.Baking- I've been wanting to make some homemade cookies for a while. I wanted to freeze some for when the grand kids come over, or just have a cookie emergency. So I decided to make some Toll House chocolate chip oatmeal cookies, w/pecans. I love the fact they have oatmeal and adding nuts makes for a great cookie. Simple and easy but very tasty.  You can also sub bittersweet chocolate, more like an adult cookie if you like.Shade areaKeeping Chickens Cool in The HeatA few years ago I asked Dave to fence in the area between the coop and the maple tree since it was open and nice and shady. The original chicken run was pretty much full sun around the vegetables and WAY too hot. So for very little money we just added a small section of fencing in an L going from the coop to the tree to the fence. Problem solved, mostly! I've written about keeping chickens cool in the summer before, but just one little inexpensive tip! I'm adding this as it works so well and is inexpensive- a hose mister! Just attach to your hose, turn the water on low, and cool mist! I bought one of these hose misters and use it near their shaded area and coop-Note here- You never want to put a mister inside a coop as it will cause too much humidity, and could make your chickens sick. I never put the mister right in the shade area, but instead I put it about three feet away, usually on a lawn chair. These use very little water, are easy to store in the winter and that little bit of extra dampness really helps cool the air. Cucumber slices, melons, any other kind of cool wet food is really helpful to. I've use crushed ice and they love that as well. Sadly we don't have an ice crusher anymore so I stick to things like cool fruits or vegetables that have a lot of water content. I read repeatedly you never want to give chickens corn in the summer as it tends to overheat them, better in the winter. Having a well-ventilated coop also helps and having a shady place for them to go. I keep the water founts clean and well filled all summer long."},
{"title": "Easy Vintage Thermos w/Flags Display, Chicks Progress", "date": "Jul 1, 2018", "text": "Easy Vintage Thermos w/Flags Display-Ironically I was tapped for jury duty the week of the 4th of July! I had set up Monday/Tuesday this week as vacation days and Wednesday our clinic is closed. I already checked and tomorrow no jury duty, I'm thinking probably none on Tuesday. One of my doctors joked oh you know all those judges and lawyers want the days off and I said yes I'm hoping for lots of plea bargaining. Dave will be working but does have the 4th off for the holiday and I'm scheduled to go back to work Thursday, unless I have jury duty. Friday also wound up being a vacation day since we had too much coverage and only one doctor in clinic. So anyway it will be a fun week with some time off , or I will be in jury duty, but I doubt it... so....A few years ago I found this vintage 1 gallon Thermos jug with cup built into the lid for $3.00 at Goodwill-With lid off-We actually used it on a couple of road trips, it kept the water and ice pretty cold! I started thinking that I should use it inside during the summer as some kind of display, but I didn't really know what to do with it? I thought maybe put it on a shelf as a summer travel display, but drew a blank. Then I saw the display that I decided to copy on Houseofhawthornes.com Basically take the lid off and fill it with some small flags and that's it! I washed it really well, then bought a pack of thirteen American flags for $10. I did find that all 13 was a little bit too many and obscured the thermos, so I took out about four or five that I used outside. So it was fast, easy and when Fourth of July is over we will still have the thermos for road trips. I should add I was really surprised how many amazing thermos displays there are on Pinterest! People have turned them into lamps, all kinds of things, and there's lots you can do with them if you're interested in looking.Chicks Progress-It was perfect timing to have the chicks out roaming around and my being home to keep an eye on things.The chicks were outside and had their area opened up to the main part of the garden all day yesterday. The two large hens seem to pretty much ignore them, except for once when Rosie decided to eat a little bit of their feed and pecked at one. No big deal, nobody hurt normal, just the \"pecking order\" developing. After the two large went hens went in around dark we moved all three of the babies into the coop and closed the door. There was some peeping but that's normal. This morning I woke up about 6:15 to one of the hens really making a racket in the coop. I decided not to have them wake up the neighbors, so I went out in my pajamas. Because the chicks spent the first night in the coop I had closed the main door that the hens use. I went and opened it and the hens came flying out. I think it may have startled them to wake up and find the 3 chicks down on the floor below them. So I went back to bed for an hour or two and then Dave told me two of the chicks had gotten into the Blackberry area-Pru the black chick taking a dust bathOut in my pajamas again we thought they had either jumped over a low fenced-off area or something. So Dave got them out and replaced the low hardware cloth with taller chicken wire. We had a scrap piece of hardware cloth to cordon off the area from the main garden.Yesterday Dave deconstructed their separate area and removed all the bird netting, etc.-They're hanging out this morning in the shade where it's cool and I will train them to start going to the area behind the coop later in the day-Next to the coop, then turn right-behind the coop towards the shade area...Since they're still exploring they don't realize that there's a large shade area under the maple tree-The area they're in is fine with shade from the berries and fence. They're enjoying having more room and are now eating some rolled oat treats. It is a lot of work at this stage, just keeping an eye on any gaps that there may be. Little trouble makers! It's worth it though... Safety is always the first priority when they're small like this. Our neighbor cat Poesy came through earlier and I watched her jump the fence and just observed. She looked at the chicks and just kept going, left the garden. Hawks not quite as much of a concern for me now since the chicks are bigger. So far so good, but a little drama this morning. It's amazing the little areas they can squeeze through or jump over. I told Dave I'm going to keep an eye on them the next several days and will adjust needed."},
{"title": "Easy DIY Red White & Blue Rags Balls, Vietnamese Pork Chops w/Cucumber Radish Salad, Planter Turned Salt Container, Harvesting Lavender", "date": "Jun 30, 2018", "text": "Easy DIY Red White & Blue Rags Balls-Summer is really here, 90's and now 80's, and cool at night. The chicks have the garden to roam in today, but are staying close to their area. The hens are more interested in their food, figures! Getting ready for the 4th of July I started putting our things out, and remembered a project I had seen a year or two ago Super Easy Rag Balls. I decided to make some and went to Jo-Ann's Fabric for some styrofoam balls and fabrics. I didn't really see fabrics that I liked. I started thinking it made more sense to just get something with generic red/white/blue and leave out for the summer. Since I have an old white enameled basin with a red rim I thought it made sense to put the balls in it. It's fun to use the basin on our coffee table in the living room. It's a simple thing to change decor-wise.  I started looking for just red and blue fabrics, then found this red check fabric-Then I found this dark blue fabric with the antique style world map print-I thought the dark blue and red would look really cute together. I bought one yard of each, half price, for a total of about $11. I bought two different sizes of styrofoam balls, the large ones were about $2. The small ones came in a six pack for about $5. I already have some straight pins from selling and some Liquid Nails glue. Basically you just tear one-inch strips, leaving he edges raw, start the first strip with a pin, cover it and just keep going around until there's no styrofoam showing. Each ball used a few pins and then I finished the end of the last strip with a small dot of liquid nails-You could put these in a glass bowl, basket or other places. I really like them! It was a really easy project to do while you're watching television. Just snip, tear, rinse and repeat. I put them in the basin and wanted something taller in the center so I used an old, red, miniature oil lamp. I might use something else, still thinking! I also have about 1/3 of a yard of both fabrics left so I will use that up  somewhere else!Vietnamese Pork Chops w/Cucumber Radish Salad-I found this recipe years ago from Rachaelraymag.com. It's really easy to make the marinade that you use the pork chops. You make the salad dressing easily ahead of time. Since our radishes didn't do as well as I hoped for in our cold frame, probably from lack of light, we wound up with some really nice tall organic radish greens. They worked great for the salad and it has tons and tons of flavor! We used our own Basil as well. The chops came out super juicy and delish.Planter Turned Salt Well-When I went to Jo-Ann's Fabrics they had lots of beachy summer things marked down $70%. When I saw this it really reminded me of a lot of the very over-priced salt containers I have seen-While it was intended to be a hanging planter I decide to use it for salt! I just removed the string, washed and and filled with the salt I always keep by my stove. For a whopping total of $4 I have a nice ceramic glazed salt well-Harvesting Lavender-I love lavender and have a few plants in our yards. While I didn't harvest this quite in it's prime, it's still gorgeous to me! I harvested most of this plant today, to bundle and dry, and leave around the house. Here's the plant last week-The bees were actively pollinating while I harvested, and I did promise them to leave some. And I did."},
{"title": "Project Weekend, Chicks New Condo & Integrating To The Flock ", "date": "Jun 27, 2018", "text": "Project Weekend-It's been an interesting week weather-wise and finally the rain seems to be behind us. It was 93 today! Dave was out of town all last week for some business training so I was taking care of the garden, the chicks, the cat, the house by myself for 5 days. I must say I did enjoy some down time. There's always watering to do since the weather seems to have warmed up and dried out. This weekend was a LOT of projects to do, luckily none of them were too involved. Lot of watering the garden since it was in the mid-eighties, very dry and windy. Then there was weeding, deadheading, pruning, spreading compost, cleaning the coop, and some indoor projects. The veggie garden is dong great including 3 totes of potatoes full with vines! We have large giant Marconi Peppers already on the vine. They're are really great Italian pepper I grew for the first time last summer that turn dark red and have a wonderful mild Smoky flavor-They're great for grilling or adding to any kind of Italian food. We have lots of green tomatoes, flowers on the lemon cucumbers and slicing cucumber, flowers on the zucchini, and tiny hotpeppers-RaspberriesThorn less Blackberries BlackberriesPeppers mixed in flower bedShade area for the hensCool on a hot dayLove our huge maple tree!Chicks New Condo & Integrating To The Flock-This weekend the weather finally cooperated enough to move the chicks outside during the day. With crazy weather, rain and colder temperatures than usual they were inside longer than I had anticipated. I did take them out in the evenings, putting them into an old outdoor playpen on top of a tarp on the deck-Nice view!From L- Annie White Plymouth, Pru Black Australorp, Sarah New Hampshire RedThey got some fresh air and got used to being outside. Saturday Dave notched a little area of the garden and it became the temporary chick condo for one week-He added a little roof for shade from scrap wood, covered gapsI added a towel for more shade late in the dayPine shavings in back for a nice nap areaNice view of garden with hen and chicksRosie looking for bugs  Happy chicksPreviously we had some small chicks I integrated into to the flock New Chick Housing I did find out that system works pretty well. The idea is that you have the chicks in an adjacent area to the full-size hens. They can all see each other, but not get to each other. You have a separate space with food/water and we did put bird netting on the top.  The little chicks have figured out how to fly! It's also to keep out any possible hawks. We made sure there were no gaps in the fencing and tightened down the bird netting with some leftover pavers. The chicks really enjoy being out during the day and the first two evenings we brought them back inside. They're just getting too big for the box so the last night they spent their first night outside. We moved their box into the coop on the floor and covered it with scrap chicken wire so the two larger hens could not get to them. It's better to be safe and make sure everything is okay than wind up with two dead or injured chicks in the morning. We brought them out this morning and they had a great day and we'll keep them in the coop separated until Saturday. The plan man is to double-check the whole chicken run area for gaps, and then release the chicks and sit back and watch. I did this last time and there was no drama and everything went well! In the the evening it's just a matter of making sure they all get into the coop. After some time goes by they'll all be the same size!"},
{"title": "Would My Grandparents Be Happy?", "date": "Jun 17, 2018", "text": "Laura and ArminiusWould My Grandparents Be Happy?Yesterday Dave and I were talking at breakfast, eating some of our wonderful eggs and an English muffin. I mentioned that my Grandmother Marguerite always told me to either use butter or jam, but not both, on my toast. I think she thought that was wasteful. I only grew up knowing one set of Grandparents, my Dad's, because the others passed away when I was very young. My Mom's parents met me after I was born, but I was very young when they died. I don't have any direct memories of them.My mom had told me a lot about them, including the stories of the wonderful gardens they grew out in Nebraska. How grandma Laura raised Rhode Island Red chickens and preserved foods. They had their root cellar and they survived the depression. She also told me how they escaped tornado's by going into the wet, cellar full of toads. She told me about what a hard worker her mother was and that my grandmother was always a tough, but caring woman. I have two wonderful quilts of hers and think about what it must have been like for her to sit there and make those out in the middle of nowhere Nebraska, in the dark. I'm not sure when electricity went into the rural areas of Nebraska, in the 1930s? I visualize her using kerosene lamps or candles to sew by.My grandfather Arminius was a mechanic who worked on trucks, tractors and cars and they would barter his repair services for things they didn't have. They would get roasting chickens, bread, fresh milk, etc., in exchange for his services. My mom said during the depression that she drank coffee instead of milk as a kid because they didn't always have that. I have great photos in my head of my grandparents and their girls in Nebraska in this house-Nebraska home, I'd love to go there somedayPete and MargueriteThe grandparents on my Dad's side I spent lots of time with. They also raised two children during the depression and my grandmother Marguerite was a wonderful cook, baker, seamstress, knitter, crocheter and made tatting. She sewed me wonderful clothes and knitted me lovely sweaters. When I was young they were living in southern California and that was a great climate to grow things in. While living in the city of Pomona, named after the goddess of plenty, they grew quite a bit of things on their city lot. Ironically they had a Little Homestead in Pomona of sorts. I remember the three-bedroom, one-and-a-half bath house very well. Lawn in the front, in back lots more! They had an avocado tree, a lemon and a lime tree, plum tree, a kumquat tree, trellises with concord grapes, and strawberries. I don't remember them ever growing any vegetables however. I remember my grandmother making homemade grape pies, canning home-grown grape juice, grape jam, and I think she made plum and Kumquat jams. I'm not quite sure whose idea it was to have all of the fruit trees because I don't know if those were there before they bought the house. I suspect on some level having fruit trees in the backyard was a nod to wanting to be more self-sufficient, having surviving the depression, but that is just a guess.I know my grandfather Pete was an avid gardener and loved working in the yard. I think some of that may have been to avoid my grandmother, who is not the nicest person. As an adult I would jokingly call her the iron fist in the velvet glove without the glove!My grandfather Alva (he went by Pete) was the opposite, really a sweetheart. He jokingly used to call me microbe or peanut!So... I think that they would be proud of me with what we're doing here, and if they were alive they would probably be doing something similar. I can see them having chickens, preserving foods, and fixing lots of things themselves. I hope they would be proud of me for the lifestyle I have. While I didn't do it for them I think that they would appreciate it. I hope so."},
{"title": "Garden & Chicks Update, Potato Progress, Cell Phone Deal/Insurance, Farm Fresh Decor", "date": "Jun 10, 2018", "text": "Garden & Chicks Update-We have had more of the same wacky weather, temps swinging like a pendulum here! In the 80s's all week, then wind hit bringing a cold front, temp dropped 20 degrees this weekend. 45 this morning, brrr. We've been trying trying to figure out when to plant some things, and that can be a little bit challenging. I had planned on putting the chicks out this weekend for a while, but the weather was just too cold.  transferred them from the laundry basket that we had them in for one week to a larger box last weekend. It works out really well since they have plenty of room, with nice pine shavings. Today I took them out, then I took the box outside and pitched it all into the compost pile. Hopefully next weekend the weather is supposed to warm up, we can move them out into a temporary coop for a while and see how they do. I plan on putting them out this week for few hours in the warm evenings. We have an outdoor playpen that we got at a thrift store years ago. It's really fun to see chicks go outside for the first time and explore! Here's the 2 boxes I put together for their temporary digs, and added chicken wire on top-busy exploring!It's amazing how fast they grow in 2 weeks! Feathers coming in, getting taller-Our hens were in trouble last week. Due to a too-low gap in fencing, they got in and completely ravaged our lemon cukes. Dave was in a huff and went shopping and came back with a few. He also bought taller chicken wire. Next night he stopped somewhere else on the way home. He bought some on sale tomatoes, more lemon cukes and some peppers. I think we're set for now! Lots of berries on the vine, and first blossoms on squash/slicing cukes. Now we just need some warm, stable weather!waeting out the rain, againMy flower seeds are coming up,flowers blooming, and the rain has really helped with that! Warm and wet, perfect for plant growth.Potato Progress-Our free potatoes seeds planted in the trash cans are doing really well! After having some torrential downpours I thought maybe they would rot in the totes, but they had pretty good drainage. We planted them in a light, fluffy organic potting soil and Dave had drilled lots of holes, so that helped. We've been adding soil once or twice a week as the green start to come up. I'll be really curious to see when we can dig the first potatoes.Cell Phone Deal/Insurance-I had an interesting experience last week. My old Galaxy 6 phone wouldn't hold a charge over several days so I could tell it was on its way out. I had insurance on the phone for several years and knew there would be a copay to replace it. I called my service provider ATT (work discount) and asked about the co-pay.  To make a long story short I paid $112 copay for an $800 new Galaxy 8 Active phone. Yes, retail about $800.00, geez! The guy in the store was really shocked that I got such a good deal. He was really helpful transferring all the data from the one phone to the other. It's a heavier phone with really long battery life and tons of storage. I thought it was kind of funny that being a homesteader of sorts I wound up with a military grade phone! It has little rubber bumpers on each corner and actual screws on the frame on the outside. I did order a couple of inexpensive covers as the back is a little bit slippery. It's great to know that it is waterproof, dust proof, sand proof, etc. It'll be nice for blogging since I can now take photos on my phone and upload them to my photo editor on my computer. I used to be able to do that but the plug-in port died a year or so ago. I was able to wirelessly charge the phone but I couldn't transfer any photos directly to my computer. I could upload them to Facebook and transfer them from there, but that was kind of a pain. So insurance may be a good idea for some people and with AT&T the co-pay goes down over time, it's not fixed. Even with the premium for the insurance of about $10 per month for the last 2 years, and the copay, I still wound up with a heck of a deal. I could have potentially bought a phone off of eBay, Amazon or some other website but I was wary of doing that. So,just a thought- if you're thinking about getting a new phone, slap a little insurance on it!Farm Fresh Decor-I finally hung up my Farm Fresh wall art, and I love it! Up close it looks like an original piece of art. I love the colors and size, perfect over my little side table. It's made of wood, 13.5\" long x 24\" tall x 0.62\" thick, less than $20.00!

{"title": "Oh Hail No! Debbie The Sci Fi Chicken", "date": "May 31, 2018", "text": "Oh Hail No!!!Last night I was watching the radar and another storm rolled in. I realized it might get pretty nasty so I put the chickens inside. Next I moved my basil that I haven't potted yet under a table for protection. Things transpired pretty quickly! In no time we had a long round of marble-sized hail-All I could think of was just if the cucumbers and tomatoes would survive, this but it appears they have. We had really high gusting winds and torrential downpours for a good half hour to an hour. It's one of the worst storms I've seen in a long time with a lot of thunder, lightning and wind. We all survived and the chickens will live to see another day! Speaking of chickens.......Debbie The Sci Fi Chicken-Well you know it had to happen sometime! A chicken was introduced in Netflix's new wonderful series Lost in Space. I really love the series myself and I think it did a great job rebooting the idea. Early on in the show, without giving too much away if you haven't seen it, there's a crash with a lone chicken survivor-The very hunky Han Solo-ish character Major Don West (dashingly played by Ignacio Serricchio) decides to save the chicken. As I was watching this scene I had to just really crack up when he said no chicken left behind! He talks to the chicken occasionally-So without giving too much away, if you haven't seen it, he saves the chicken and then the chicken saves his life, with the help of a little technology-He then names the chicken Debbie. At one point he has to go on a dangerous trip and leaves Debbie in the care of someone else. It's pretty funny when he describes how to put the chicken to sleep at night, by laying on her back and rubbing her stomach. Great cast, much of it was filmed in Canada and the CGI is excellent!  There's also blog link listed below with some fun information and I highly recommend the show if you like sci-fi. Honoring Debbie The Spacefaring Chicken"},
{"title": "New Chicks! Garden Update, Growing Potatoes In Garbage Cans, Thrifting Scores", "date": "May 29, 2018", "text": "From the L-Sarah, Annie, PruNew Chicks!Sorry I haven't posted anything for two weeks but life has been crazy. Between babysitting 2 toddlers Sat./Sun., work and gardening it has been a lot to keep up with. I was really happy that I took today off work and had a four-day weekend. Since we don't travel on Memorial Day weekend it was a good time to plant the veggie garden, sleep in (a little) and play catch up. I have a few more projects today and then back to work tomorrow. I'm going to plant some herbs, shop for some odd things, and barbecue beef is in the crock pot. It's 79 degrees and humid but it beats the rain!!! So here we go-Saturday we went out to Caldwell, just outside Boise, to the Dunlap Hatchery and bought 3 new chicks. We bought a Black Australorp, the black speckled chick-Black with teal, pretty!A White Plymouth Rock, the yellow chick-A New Hampshire Red, the yellow/gray chick-Our NHR hen from years ago- They should all be about the same size when grown, very intentional. They are six days old and all did really great through the weekend! There was a lot of distress crying from the one chick for the first two days, but that settled down. With our tiny little flock it's interesting to see their personalities, and the curiosity right off the bat. I added a little mirror which they stand by, like to look at and preen in front of. When one starts grooming then they all start grooming, ditto eating and sleeping. They're already developing a flock mentality apparently. I always name my chicks and Pru is the Black Australorp, Annie is the Plymouth White, and Sarah is the New Hampshire Red. I like old fashioned names from New England, since they seem to fit the old New England breeds. Chick area in our spare bedroom-I made a mistake the first time I bought chicks, buying them over spring break. It made it necessary for them to be inside way too long. I've learned since then to wait until the weather is fairly warm and then buy the chicks, so they will be inside for a minimal amount of time. They will feather out in the next couple of weeks and I will start putting them outside to integrate with the flock then. We did a system before that works pretty well Chick to Flock Integration Tips  We separated them in a small part of the garden for several days, and in the coop, and integrate them after several days, no drama!That went really well giving the older hens a chance to get used to the babies. The babies then just joined the older girls in the main garden and in the coop. It will take about 5 months or so for the young pullets to start laying, so that will put us into late fall-early winter depending on how things go. With having two older hens, winding down on their laying (you never want to have one chicken alone) it was a good time to get some chicks!New Verbena, pollinators!Garden Update-The weather has been really crazy lately, with a lot of afternoon monsoon rains. I don't remember this kind of weather pattern this time of year ever, but on the bright side everything is super, super green. Sometimes the rain doesn't last that long but sometimes it does. Late last week around sunset it started pouring for several hours leaving everything nice and wet. Sunday night we had a really massive lightning/thunder show for several hours and torrential downpours overnight. That left everything pretty steamy and humid yesterday but that was okay. Garden is coming along great, both in the front and back yard. Lots of flowers are blooming, peaches on the peach tree, pears too.  We had a lot of shade n our veggie area, so Dave took down a large, lower branch off our monster maple tree before we planted the veggies-Cutting up for our city compost binBottoms up! Free ranging during pruning/planting timeDave removed a small evergreen shrub that got mangled by a garbage can, shoved across our sidewalk by a (apparently) drunk driver. Bizarre! It was really damaged so Dave dug it up and we bought a couple of perennials for the area- TickseedYarrowHe also dug up a big shrub (vines) that we inherited when we bought the house. He really likes digging up unsightly shrubs, go figure! It bloomed in the Spring, the rest of the year just sat there. Neither of us liked it so he removed it. We planted another perennial there. I chose Tickseed and Yarrow because both are pretty low maintenance, bloom, are pollinators, don't require a lot of water-Another YarrowAdjacent area, 2 year old Catmint, huge and the bees love it!Our front entryway, nice and lush!Over two weekends we bought some vegetable starts, herbs, and annual flowers. Yesterday we laid out all of the warm weather vegetables in the main garden, and Dave planted a row of green beans on the side of house, where we tore down the shed-Last year's 2016-2017 heavy winter snows really did a number on the nurseries, and warm weather starts were hard to find. This year the opposite, we found BIG tall tomato plants in tiny pots, $3.00!Various heirloom tomatoes with Italian peppers in front, much sunnier, thanks to tree trim!Lemon Cukes, with room for more peppersTomato, Zucchini and slicing Cukes, Having chickens we do put things in a couple different areas with divider fences and that works pretty well.Kale ready to eat, with peas behindHerbs to plant and I started Nasturtium seedsDave got a great idea from his brother that I thought I'd share here and hopefully this will make sense. We don't have a sprinkler system on our lot, so we drag hoses around, either hand water, use soaker hoses or use small garden sprinklers. One of the things that we wound up doing (like lots of people) is crimping the hose so you can take the sprinkler head off/change to the hand sprayer. Dave bought a short hose, 15 feet, and an adapter to put on it. When you put on the adapter it gives you the ability to not only turn the water off, but also adjust the flow. So instead of walking clear across the yard or around the house or crimping the hose you basically shut off the water at the start of the 15-foot section. Then you unscrew your sprinkler and put on your handheld watch her or vice versa. It works great and saves you from getting soaked by the sprinkler, walking back and forth repeatedly, or trying to adjust the water. Especially if you're working around a corner! So you can just buy a short stretch of hose and then by an adjuster easy peasy! Hose was $8.00, adjuster $4.00, much simpler. No more damaging hoses by crimping them.Growing Potatoes In Garbage Cans-A friend of Dave's at work gifted us with some potato starts and while we weren't planning on doing this we decided why not! It's a great way to plant and grow vertically in a small space. We had two garbage cans that were pretty beat up, one was cracked on the bottom and the other was getting pretty worn out as well- We decided since we didn't really use them anymore we would grow potatoes in those. For $6 we also bought a plastic tote at Home Depot-Leveled after photoWe planted Yukon Golds in the two large containers since those are my favorites and red potatoes in the blue tote. I did quite a bit of research and the basics are- drilling holes in the bottom of the container, some holes in the lower part of the sides for drainage-We added about 3 inches of almost-ready compost to the very bottom, with several inches of potting soil on top of that, and the potatoes on top of that-also leveledAfter you cover the potatoes with soil just water to keep them moist,but not soggy. We put them in 3 different spots in full sun. It's good we had drainage after a torrential downpour Sunday night as I could tell that the soil had compacted and it was pretty wet. With temperatures in the 80's this week hopefully the soil will dry out and we will be fine. Once we start seeing some greens coming up through the soil we will cover those with more potting soil. Just with that continue until there blooms up on the top of the vines and they turn brown. And then it will be harvest time! We can store some of the potatoes in our small outside refrigerator, and may give some away.$3.00Thrifting Scores-I found some great thrifting scores a couple of days ago, I bought several new books for a grand babies and a really nice large ceramic water pitcher for our dining table. It has Irises on it, one of my favorite flowers. One of the things I want to do this fall is actually plant some bulbs including some irises so it was a good reminder! I bought two used cook books on Amazon. I went out to Eddie Bauer's Outlet since we got a $10 coupon in our email. It's always funny to go there when I get lucky, since I basically found a nice pair of $75 work slacks. The original tag was $75, mark down to $40 something, with the sale reduction and my $10 coupon I paid a whopping $5! They're nice dressy fabric in a dark gray which will go with lots of different tops.I also found two blouses on eBay, one is a Columbia Sportswear fishing blouse, (yes fishing) with a SPF built in. I've owned one of these blouses before and they are great for summer weather because they are cool with vents on the back of the shoulders-It's actually dressy enough to wear to work. On the surface it just looks like another cotton blouse and I love the pink and green plaid. The other I found was a new blouse a Caribbean Joe brand with great colors again to wear to work in the hot weather. It will look cute with dark slacks! Maybe the Eddie Bauer ones!The total for both tops was less than I would have paid locally for new. And it's easier to find specialty tops like that on eBay than it is driving all over town to various thrift stores. I also found a pair of shorts for Dave on eBay that he loves. They're about $35 new, and he loves them since he does some running, and a lot of heavy yard work in the heat. They're breathable lightweight shorts. They are Adidas brand, $12,  and another pair I'm keeping an eye on. When you really like something really specific eBay is definitely the way to go. I was also happy I also sold something on Etsy, for about the price of what paid for the slacks, two tops and Dave shorts with some left over! Worked out pretty well!"},
{"title": "Independence Days Challenge, Our Sick Peach Tree, New Chicks Coming Soon!", "date": "May 12, 2018", "text": "Independence Days Challenge-We have gone from warm 80's weather to 60's this week, pouring rain most of yesterday. It's been an awful pollen season here, everyone's miserable! Itchy eyes, sneezing, runny noses. My bedroom HEPA filter died, bummer, but I got a replacement so that's helping. Hopefully the rain will settle some of the pollen off the trees. It's so green though, loving it!!! Lots of birds out, flowers blooming, veggies up in the raised bed. The sun is shining this morning, but a little cloudy. So, here's a look at what we've been up to!1. Plant Something- We planted 2 varieties of carrots and radishes about 2 weeks ago. And they're coming up really nicely. Right before that we planted pansies, bush peas and Italian kale, also doing well. It was really a good idea to put the bird netting over the kale I think since the birds always attack it. We're looking at planning warm weather vegetables here pretty soon. We thought about doing that this weekend but it was too wet and are babysitting. We were gifted with a large container of Yukon Gold potatoes for seed potatoes. I was wanting to plant potatoes this summer anyway, now we have lots of freebies to use. We're going to plant in a garbage can and see how that goes. More on that later!Pansies in front Chives had nice purple flowers too Herb box doing great, all wintered over!!!2. Harvest Something- Eggs and herbs. The peach tree is loaded! Hoping for a good pear, apple and Choke cherry harvest as well. 3. Preserve/Store Something- I stocked up on some Italian sausage and artisans breads at our local grocery outlet. I froze some of the extra breads. Our freezer is about 1/3 full, which is good! We've been using up our frozen meats, peaches, apple sauce, tomatoes and rhubarb. We'll need the room for this years bounty. Running low on peach jam, apple butter and Choke cherry jelly.4. Manage Reserves- Get a Good Deal/Barter/Stock Up/Prep- Dave bought spray paint thru his employer, BIG cans only $2.00. I looked everywhere for some queen size sheets since we were down to one set. I finally found a great deal on Overstock.com. I love for percale since it's a little bit heavier and lasts longer. It was an odd color, but matches our summer quilt pretty well! The color is called papaya-I had an eye exam and Dave got his new glasses at Costco, so I decided to go there. With my current eye coverage I saved over $125.00 from my other fancy optometrist. I will keep getting exams there, but not so much the glasses anymore. I had to buy a few new tops for work and found some great deals at Penney's. I bought a few thrifted art items-I took this one to work for my deskFor the dining room I recently switched from Neutrogena day moisturizer, $12.99 for four ounces compared to Trade Joe's $6.99 for six ounces. It had great reviews,  research is always helpful BEFORE I buy. I had been using Trader Joe's cleanser for years, great stuff, just $5.99 and really cleans your face gently but well-The moisturizer is nice and light, but leaves my skin feeling much softer. Living in high desert REALLY takes it toll on your skin. I decided to try their serum as well, $9.99, and you don't need much. It was also well reviewed. Put on before the moisturizer and my skin is super soft, but not oily-Next I found a replacement HEPA air purifier for our bedroom on Amazon, better deal than locally-                                                         I run it all day, then turn off at night. When I deep clean I can move it easily into other rooms. It has a removable, washable sponge filter as well, great for catching Anya's cat fur! I also ordered some hard-to-find boxes of tea, since they don't weight much-                                                         I LOVE this tea, it's a black tea, but very smooth. Orange is the grade of tea, not the flavor. I drink hot tea most days, since I'm not a coffee fan. We keep a nice variety on hand, but this was getting hard to find.5. Eat the Food- Try NewFoods/Recipe- I found a copycat dressing recipe for my favorite Mexican restaurant On the Border that closed. It's a national chain but both local restaurants just closed up. I LOVE this dressing! Spicy and smoky. I made a double batch and keep in the fridge for later. I've started buying Jicama and really liked it! It has a lot of nutritional value, is slightly sweet, crunchy and in the radish family. I might try and grow some next year.6. Build Community Food Systems- Nothing at this time.7. Recycle/Re-Use- We needed to repaint our 10 year-old garden work bench. We bought it locally and it fit perfect in the space we had on our small deck. I had done a light repainting a few years ago, but it really needed a heavier paint job. Dave bought some industrial spray paint thru his employer in a nice green (huge can $2.00!) that was close to the original paint. We moved it to the grass on a tarp. I brushed it down really well  then I sanded the top to get a real smooth surface. We did two coats on the entire bench, and a third coat on the top. It looks great and this will really protect a long time-Before shot- faded, messy, emptied out  Nailed a few loose boards downchick suppliesMisc garden suppliesDave nailing boardsYou can see the weather damage, even with covering the top with plastic every winterI sanded with a palm sander and got nice and smooth-Dave had added the upper shelf originally for me, also got paintedAll done!We added the hanging screws when we purchased itDave removed the old brick edging from the front yard. The county will push into our yard a bit. We had also collected free river stone last fall, so Dave installed it. Looks great!!! We've saved the used brick for other part of the yards. 8. Skill Up- I learned from the Master Gardener program at the University of Idaho extension office that are peach tree that only has Peach Leaf curl but also has aphids and baby ladybugs. I didn't know one tree could have quite so much going on at once. I learned about the copper spray and when to apply it-Curled leaves and aphids9. Regenerate What is Lost/SalvageSomething- We painted the workbench. We'll clean and bring our chick feeder and waterer inside-We sorted thru the contents of the workbench. Tossed some things, will put plastic totes to store the rest in the bench-Also glued our old washboard that's been out in the garden for several years- Our Sick Peach Tree-I looked out the window a week or two ago and realized our Red Haven peach tree looked sick. I emailed some photos to the Master Gardener program at the University of Idaho Extension office but they couldn't really tell a lot from those. Since I had Monday off I cut several samples off the tree and drove them over to the office. Luckily it's not too far from here. It's the same office that I trained in to become a Master Gardener. I talked to someone there and she gave me a few ideas, but later they gave the samples to an Arborist. It turned out it has a fungus which is fairly common, but we won't be able to treat until the tree loses all its leaves in the fall. It's loaded with peaches, which will be fine, and will generate new leaves as the sick ones fall off. I was advised to go ahead and fertilize the tree since it takes extra energy for the tree to repopulate its leaves at this time. I had noticed lots of little tiny white tubes on the branches which turned out to be aphids. I'd also noticed some black bugs on the tree, which turned out to be baby ladybugs! Great news since ladybugs eat aphids. So the good news is the tree will survive. We will spray it with a copper spray in the fall, then again next spring which should kill most of the fungus. The aphids should die off as the weather gets hotter. And the baby ladybugs are bonus! The peaches will still be edible and the tree life will go on.New Chicks Coming Soon!We had decided this winter to go ahead and get some new chicks this spring. Our hen Gwynne died recently and so that left us with two hens. We typically get about two eggs every 2 or 3 days, but with the two hens getting a little bit older we decided to add some new chicks to the flock. We'll drive out to Dunlap Hatchery in Caldwell, not too far outside of Boise. They have a great selection of breeds, their prices are good and the chicks are always healthy. I had a bad experience buying chicks from two different feed stores locally. One died the next day, the other was the wrong breed. So we drive out to Dunlap's and get some great chicks there. When I get three chicks I always like to get three different breeds to tell them apart easily. I seem to have better luck with the non-hybrid chickens for some reason. So this year we're probably going to be getting a New Hampshire Red, which we had before-I'll probably buy a White Plymouth Rock, and possibly a Black Australorp. I may see what else they have in stock when we get there. Since pullets don't lay eggs for about 5 or 6 months basically we would start getting some eggs next winter. Given the state of the world better too many eggs than not. Chicks are always fun to get and really exciting but they take a consistent level of care. I called the hatchery today and Dave and I decided to get the new chicks the Saturday of Memorial Day weekend, since we will be home. I'm also off the following Tuesday so I will have a four-day weekend to get acquainted."},
{"title": "The Sad, Dark Side Of Chicken Keeping", "date": "May 5, 2018", "text": "The Sad, Dark Side Of Chicken Keeping-Last week we finally lost Gwynne my sweet little hen. I came home from work and went out to check on her since she never came down from a nesting box. She was sort of falling over in the nesting box and not looking well at all. I brought her in and put her in a laundry basket to see what was going on. It was really obvious to me she didn't have much time left. I tried to give her a little food and water but she didn't really respond. I put her on top of a thick towel and left her in the laundry basket in the living room. I kept an eye on her all evening. She died about 3 hours later pretty peacefully. A lot of people promote keeping chickens as a really fun hobby- lots of great free eggs and they eat lots of bugs and weeds. Nobody really talks about trying to diagnose sick chickens, trying to treat them at home, and then losing them. Say you're outside, you see one of your really healthy hens really active. They're laying, eating and look great. It's really frustrating and sad when you come out one hour later and they're just dead in the garden. No sign of injury or attack, just laying there, dead.I read chickens can actually have heart attacks, which is not a lot of comfort when it happens to one of your own. I can see if you had a large commercial flock, with hundreds of chickens, losing one occasionally is not a big deal. If you have three or four and you raise them from chicks by hand it's a little different kettle of fish-So cute!We have a small flock, so you really get to know their personalities and you get more attached. Gwynne, for instance, was the smallest of the three, had been picked on a lot and needed extra TLC from time to time. Rosie is our big Rhode Island red mama, protects everybody and is also very domineering, to the other hens. Ellie our Barred Rock is the sky is falling chicken. I don't know what it is but every Barred Rock I've ever owned is skittish, shy and flies off the handle for no apparent reason. Maybe it's genetics?Buff OrpingtonsAnyway after losing Gwynne I started thinking about the other chickens I've lost, some from worms, one from fly strike, and others from who knows what? With Gwynne it was obvious what happened since Dave saw it. A bad fall in the coop, getting knocked off the upper roost in the dark. She probably hit something on the way down and had some kind of major fracture or internal damage or both. She lasted several weeks with home treatment. Sadly most chicken owners can't find, or afford, a Vet for this kind of thing.Fun diggingI think the best thing to ruminate on if you're are thinking about starting a flock of this- there's tons of information online and books about keeping chickens. BUT nobody talks much about the mental or emotional impact of all this. It's frustrating, it's sad. You feel GUILTY when these things happen thinking- what could I have done differently? You feel pretty STUPID when your hen just dropped dead out in the garden with no symptoms. Dave's been very gracious and digging holes for me in the garden to bury most of them. You dig deep, get a nice old pillowcase and let them spend eternity communing with the worms. One hen who died from fly strike and was covered in maggots. She was gone, and the smell was awful, so what can you do? In a trash bag, in the garbage can.Hopefully think about this before you start investing financially and mentally, be aware you will also be investing emotionally. I hope this all makes sense? Here's another post about this Dark Side of Keeping Chickens  Keeping chickens is a great thing, and very rewarding. I have learned from my mistakes and manage my hens better now. I try to keep them healthy and safe. You do what you can, but buyer beware."},
{"title": "Installing Bird Netting On A Cold Frame, Growing Billy Bob Flowers For Decor", "date": "Apr 29, 2018", "text": "Installing Bird Netting On A Cold Frame-A few weeks ago we planted our cold frame with some bush peas and Italian kale. We temporarily covered it with row cover since the weather has been cold off and on, and to keep the birds out. With the weather being a little bit more normally cool, we bought some bird netting today to cover the cold Frame. We had one old netting section that was all torn and wadded up. For storage I will wrap around a piece of cardboard next time. Birds in the past have really attacked any kind of greens that we've grown there even though we put out lots of bird food. Bird netting is only about $10 for a 14' by 14' foot area locally. One of the things I learned thru observation was if you just cover something with bird netting they can sometimes go under it, or perch on it, then peck through the holes to the greens down below. Several years ago, when I was growing some Swiss chard in a pot, I used some scrap bamboo to hold the bird netting away from the greens and it worked great!! Dave pulled some old grading stakes out of the garage, always handy to have for gardening projects. They're really cheap, thick and Dave pounded in the stakes on the corners and one of the center to elevate the bird netting. He added some river rocks to hold down the netting as well. Now the birds can't get to the greens but rain and sunshine will still go through. Perfect solution!Growing Billy Ball Flowers For Decor- I was browsing thru a Pinterest board of mine when I saw this sweet  kitchen redo and the yellow flowers-  From 2littlesuperheroes.com Kitchen MakeoverJust too cute!I've seen these flowers on numerous occasions but never took the time to look into what they actually were. They're called Billy Ball flowers and are sold dried all over the internet. The official name is Craspedia, a member of the mum family. I ordered some on eBay since they have the best price, about $14 for 30 plus stems-More gold in real lifeThey're really a nice gold, with long stems. I used some in a clear Ikea vase I had on the kitchen window- I trimmed the rest to fit for my living room vase. I also have a white pitcher they will look great in-                                         I did some research about actually growing them since they're relatively expensive. You always have to pay for shipping, unless you can find them locally. I called a local nursery and they have some on order to come in next week. They do well in a warm climate like our summer, as an annual flower. I'm going to try to purchase some and grow them and see how they do! They're really cute, last for years and would be fun for around the house or for gifts. I will post more later after I am able to purchase them. With our crazy spring weather it made more sense to me to try to buy some starts then to try to start from seed since we don't have full-blown Greenhouse.

I made the dressing, smoky and spicy. Very close to the original. I doubled the recipe for extra. I used torn up romaine as a base, added black beans, corn, cukes, red onion, and jicama sticks.

I hope you all are doing what you can to keep us all spinning!Here's our little bit of Earth-Update on Injured Hen-I wanted to update on how Gwynne my injured chicken was doing. For a few days I saw zero effect with using the Arnica. After that things went downhill fast since she stopped eating and wasn't moving around much. After talking to a friend, whose husband used to work in the poultry business, I switched to baby aspirin. I also moved her down to a lower part of the coop at night. I thought she might not be coming down since she was afraid she might fall again. I put her in the large double nesting box at night with food and water. I started her on ground up baby aspirin and water using a oral syringe. I noticed within 24 hours she came out of the coop on her own and I've been bringing her in twice a day to feed her.Friday night I bought a bag of fresh spinach, one of her faves and some dried meal worms for protein-I brought her in after work and I put a bowl of water with ripped up spinach in it and she attacked it! She wasn't sure about the meal worms, but she did start eating some. The next morning I brought her in again, now she's eating more normally, seems to have her appetite back which is good. She still limping, but not as much, I'm going to stop bringing her in for food Monday, back to work, unless she needs it. I will just take food out there and try to get her back onto her feed. This morning when I gave her the liquid with the aspirin her comb and wattle started turning purple and I thought she might have aspirated on the liquid. I had taken her out, but brought her right back in. She recovered after 15 minutes, no more liquid like that. Chickens have a very narrow windpipe for sure, not worth the risk. So all in all it's been very frustrating and scary, but she seems to be on the mend. Lesson learned try different things and be creative!Last collard greensBackyard Garden Work TimeDave did a lot of work yesterday on the garden. I had a really bad night sleep Friday, my back was really aching so I stayed inside and did some other things. Last weekend I harvested the last collard greens in the raised bed that had wintered over. Dave turned all the compost, put several inches on the raised bed. I mulched some baby Lavenders I planted last fall. He worked on various parts of the backyard, trimmed all the berries, did a light pruning of the apple tree. He took the lower window off the coop since the weather is much warmer, around 70, and put the big hardware cloth screen on. I'm leaving the plastic sheet on the coop door for now in case it gets cold and windy to keep the upper roosting area out of the draft. They basically created a hanging plastic adjustable curtain that works great. During the day I can open it up to let the air circulate more and that night I can close it easily keep the draft down. You want good air circulation in a coop, but during the night you want to make sure there's no breezes if it gets colder. It was 42 last night so it works really well. Today we be planted vegetables in the raised bed- bush peas, Italian Kale and some pansies for color, we covered with row cover to protect from the birds-For vegetables in the raised bed I bought a couple different kinds of radish seeds and carrot seeds, will plant this week-I have a lot of seeds I'm going to scatter for various types of poppies in the front and back yard.We're going to plant some potatoes soon in a garbage can to try that, probably Yukon golds. It's funny living in Idaho people always wonder why would you want to grow your own potatoes in the potato state? The reality is potatoes in the stores are probably a year old or so and are nothing like fresh potatoes. I bought some potatoes at a farmer's market a couple years ago and couldn't believe the difference! They were creamy and had a very different, unique flavor. So we will plant those in the next week or two. I made my favorite Muffuletta Sandwich for dinner last night, since I knew we'd be busy all day. I made the olive salad part ahead of time and actually wound up taking a nap because I was so tired. It made for a great dinner and I have learned to appreciate naps as I have gotten older. I realize if I'm really overly tired on a weekend and can take a nap why wouldn't I? It's amazing how much more rested you can feel after a one-hour nap! The weather was great again today, 65, and I got more done since I finally slept last night."},
{"title": "Natural Pain Remedies For Injured Chickens, 'Prepper's Survival Retreats' Book Giveaway!", "date": "Apr 14, 2018", "text": "Natural Pain Remedies For Injured Chickens-Poor Gwynne, she gets picked on, gets sick, and now appears to have either a fractured pelvis or hip issue. This week I saw her in the garden run limping terribly. I picked her up and checked her. No wounds that I could see, bleeding, etc. Dave said a night or so ago he saw her fall off the coop perch, probably pushed off by another hen.  I left her outside for another day, then realized how much pain she was in. She would walk around a little, then collapse on the cold, damp ground. With 32 in the forecast I brought her in. She was hungry and thirsty. I think she hadn't been going in the coop much to eat or drink. She warmed up and rested in the kitchen chicken hospital, large laundry basket-She can stand up pretty comfortably but starts breathing hard when she sits down. I think she may have a fractured hip or pelvis? Best guess. After doing some research I bought some Boiron Arnica pellets-                                                                   Very small- After doing some research it appeared I could give her a \"dose\", so I decided to just start with one pellet. I also put her in a larger space to observe, a tarp under our chick outdoor enclosure (thrifted) in the kitchen-I dosed her twice with no seeming effect. She appears to be really hurting laying down, breathing hard. More comfortable standing up. So I mashed up a full dose of 5 pellets into applesauce, but she wouldn't eat it. I use the small amount of water in a cup and put in 10 pellets, a double dose. After dissolved I added a pinch of sugar and loaded that into a small pet's oral syringe. Dave had to hold her and I gave her 1 dose. Waiting to see how it goes, time will tell. I didn't see much effect, so gave  her a 2nd dose tonight.

The title certainly sounded interesting. She sent me a copy and it's really pretty fascinating! One of the things I've learned about the Depression in the last century the people survived reasonably comfortably because they were prepared and have a certain skill set. They also had a home/property that was set up to grow, preserve foods and be more self-sufficient. I don't know, however, if those people were also concerned about security issues? I gave the book a look , lots of great info, and here are the chapter titles, in order-A brief history of collapse, What do you need to survive, The big questions, Purchasing an existing home, Can you make it here? Building or renovating your survival retreat, Survival groups and your new retreat relocation, Whittling down a short list of properties. There are some graphics and photos scattered throughout the book and lots of interesting questions like- timing is everything, how soon do you want to make this happen? So if you're interested in winning this book all you need to do is leave a comment below and follow me on Facebook. It's that simple! I will do the drawing at the end of this next week, post the winner and then ask you to email me your shipping info. I've already seen lots of other great reviews, what I've seen so far I really like, is very relevant and very practical."},
{"title": "Meaty Pasta Sauce, DIY Flagstone Pond Edging, Read Your Pet Food Labels, Strawberry Rhubarb Crumble ", "date": "Apr 8, 2018", "text": "Meaty Pasta Sauce W/ Home Grown Tomatoes-A week or two ago I was taking the last of my frozen peaches out of the freezer I realized I had some homegrown tomatoes left! I didn't know that! When I froze our organic tomatoes I also added some chopped red and green Italian peppers-That was great since I wanted to do another batch of a very meaty pasta sauce for multiple dinners. Yesterday I thawed them, drained them (tons of juice!) and started sauteing a couple of tubes of New York-style Italian sausage. To that I added a chopped onion, several cloves of fresh garlic, herbs and the tomatoes. I also added a couple large cans of tomato sauce since I needed something with more thick liquid with all of that meat. I cooked that down for several hours and it came out great! Since I didn't completely crush the meat there were mini meatballs mixed in! I served on top of rigatoni pasta with some fresh basil topped with some shredded fresh cheese. I haven't some french bread and salad and it was awesome! After a very rainy day it was nice to have a nice, hot , hearty meal.I also took down my Easter decor and left up my Spring things-Daffodils already mean Spring!More rain this afternoon-DIY Flagstone Pond Edging-For several years we have thought about putting a new edging around our little recycled pond that we had built in the backyard. We got the pond liner at a yard sale really cheap, bought a new pump and a few different nozzles at a thrift store. We used to river rock that we had scavenged originally but I really like the look of the flat flagstone. One of the things about river stone is that a didn't really cover the black plastic edging of the pond, sort of defeating the purpose of having it look natural.  One of the other problems with River Rock what it was continually fall into the pond,  fall backwards into the shrubs, and was basically unstable- I'd seen tons of photo online with flagstone edging where it covers the plastic so all you see is a stone and the water. Dave and I went to Home Depot yesterday and surprisingly they didn't have any in stock. Luckily there was a Lowe's not too far from here so we drove there. It is been really windy all day, had rain in the morning, so I check the weather before we left. I took my rain jacket and told Dave he should probably take his, which he didn't. It started sprinkling while we were at Home Depot and turned into a torrential downpour going to Lowe's. Thunder and lighting oh my! It was an absolute monster storm the whole time we were there but we did find some Flagstone. Nice sized pieces for about $8 each- Natural Patio Stone. We bought 12 pieces, for about $100.00.  David had measured about how many square feet we would need-And big bags of potting soil, $2.00 each!By the time we left we were both pretty soaked, but that was okay. Dave wore a hoodie, was soaked and I was soaked from the knees down to my socks. We did have to change clothes, but the afternoon turned out to be fairly dry. I found a video on YouTube that had real simple and easy directions about how to edge the flagstone as needed-He removed the river stone first and leveled the area little bit-He started doing a dry lay out of the stone. The dry layout lets you see where the potential pieces should go and what you might need to adjust-Lots of square cornersMany of the pieces were square/rectangular, and we wanted to soften those up a bit, so the video was perfect. Dave set up a little work area and went to work-Bucket to catch the odd pieces brilliant!He took his hammer to most of the edges to curve a little bit and fit them. All in all the whole project took about 3 hours of labor, but it looks awesome! Thanks Dave!The stone will last for years and years, and are a great investment. We store leftover river stone for other projects in the yard, and had a little bit of extra flagstone that we will use somewhere else-I think it's always better to have a little bit left over that's running out. It will look even better when we add the water lettuce plants and we bark dust!Read Your Pet Food Labels-For a while on your wonderful cat Anya had had some stomach problems, and had gone to the vet a few times. For a variety reasons I decided to take a look at what the ingredients of the Science Diet cat food that she had been on. It's advertised veterinarians recommend this diet most! I was kind of surprised when I started really looking at the ingredients how many fillers there were in the food-I want around Pet Smart where we buy our food with my cell phone and took a few photos of the ingredients to compare. I was also looking at the prices and if it was a standard food that they usually carried. I was kind of surprised to see that Blue Buffalo, a food that advertises itself as very healthy, was actually a bit cheaper than what I had been buying. A lot less fillers, also included vegetables, other nutrients, and other ingredients that were pretty healthy-Short of making your own pet food from scratch it can be challenging to find an affordable pet food that's healthy. And affordable can be a relative term. So I decided to post the two pictures of the ingredient labels just as a comparison. Whenever you see anything that says pulp that is filler, anything that basically is some kind of a ground up ingredients is usually junk. I switched to Blue Buffalo and she seemed to really like it and so far her stomach is fine, so time will tell. Just a reminder to read the labels since you may be able to get something that's healthier that's actually cheaper!                                                               Click here for more infoStrawberry/Rhubarb Crumble-With our rhubarb coming up in the garden it reminded me that I have some in our freezer. I bought some strawberries and decided to make a strawberry rhubarb crumble. It's one of our favorite spring desserts because it's sweet and tart and super healthy. I decided to try this recipe since I've had tried a few others. With this I did not use the vanilla pod and used walnuts. Yummy on a cool Spring day since the temperature dropped 10 degrees.

{"title": "Saving a Blouse/Rotating a Collar, Healthier Eating/Spiralizer Review", "date": "Apr 1, 2018", "text": "Saving a Blouse/Rotating a Collar-Well Spring is sure here! It's been in the 60s the last several days and that's been a really great relief from crazy weather in the last few weeks. Dave's started some early gardening, and we plan on planting the cold frame with cold veggie seeds nest weekend. The \"sun room\" has been taken down off the coop, hens are loving it!I bought a springy-type blouse on eBay a while back, since but I loved the blue and green motif, perfect for spring. When it arrived I washed it like I usually do anything used. I noticed a light brown stain the outer part of the collar right in front where you can see it. So I treated the stain, but it didn't come out. Three more rounds with other types of stain removers and no luck. I really loved the blouse, which was like-new and scratched my head a while. I remembered seeing several years ago the idea of rotating a collar. Someone did a blog post about her husband's favorite shirt that was worn on the inside. The idea was that you remove the collar, flip it over and reattach the collar. Problem solved! So I thought what do I have to lose? I have a decent sewing machine, so I pulled out my favorite seam ripper-I removed the collar completely and sat it aside-Next I pinned the collar in place-I tried to match the width of the stitching as close as I could so it would look the same. Reattaching the collar only took about 10 minutes. After it was flipped over the stain is now underneath, problem solved!Healthier Eating/Spiralizer Review-I've been working on doing healthier eating since last October, when I decided I needed to stop dieting and start getting healthier. I was on the border of pre-diabetes and wanted to nip it in the bud. Really happy to report I've lost about the size and a half, and some weight. My A1C is closer to normal now, happy dance. One of the things I did in general was smaller portions, a lot less wheat, and sugar. When Dave saw his doctor recently she encouraged him to start eating more veggies. She mentioned using a spiralizer instead of eating pasta. I had heard of them before but wasn't really sure what I could do with it? I did some research and reviewed quite a few different makes/models and prices to get an idea what was out there. I thought it would be great idea for both of us since we both love pastas. I found you can actually spiralize all kinds of different ingredients, fruits and veggies. After doing some research I came up with this model which I ordered on Amazon-                                                              I chose this model as it was moderately priced, comes with three blades with built in storage for them. One blade is spaghetti, one fettuccine, and one large ribbons/curls. It takes up fairly minimal space-I didn't want a little tiny handheld one is that looks really awkward, and I didn't want a really expensive electric one that was overpriced. I like the fact it doesn't take up a lot of storage after it's all put back together. I did one zucchini tonight cut in half, and used the fettuccine size spiral- I sauteed in a little bit of homemade pesto and olive oil. The fettuccine size came out nice and firm, I served with pesto flank steakI got this library book to test drive, and I LOVE IT!                                                               I can see all kinds of applications now. One of the bladed does large curls, great for salads. I saw a  recipe where you make carrot noodles, roast with some a little olive oil and salt, top with smoked salmon, avocado slices and a herbal dressing. Looks great! Really enjoying it so far, hope to use more and try lots of other ideas. I have about three more books on hold at the library so I can play around and see what I can come up with, keep you posted! I also think I may be able to dry some foods using this, but will do more research."},
{"title": "Spring Rains & Snow, Hardboiling Fresh Eggs- Egglettes Review, Swedish Washcloths, Thrifting Scores!", "date": "Mar 25, 2018", "text": "TodaySpring Rains & Snow-We've had an unusually cold, wet week. Almost an inch of rain in 3 days! Good timing since we just put out the rain barrel! Beats the huge snow back east for sure. Everything is greening up and the hens have enjoyed some time out-then we woke up to snow this morning-Luckily it started to melt in the afternoon-Lots of hazy sunshine. Not bad but classic, unstable spring weather, stay tuned...Hardboiling Fresh Eggs, Egglettes Review-Over the years I've tried a few different ways of hard boiling my fresh eggs usually I've tried lots of different combinations and then one night I stumbled onto Egglets.  Egglettes are silicon pods with a twist off lid to use in boiling water. Basically boil eggs without the shell. I started thinking it seemed like a perfect solution to my fresh egg issue. Typically I just wound up buying store-bought eggs to hard-boil since my fresh ones would be one big mess when I tried to peel them. I did a test drive of them today, cracked my fresh eggs inside and I did three-Pods with lidEgg inside, ready to goI started the water boiling and put the eggs in and left them in for the suggested amount of time. For hard boiled egg time the suggested amount was 13 to 16 minutes. That seems a little long to me but I decided to do it the way they suggested. They came out about 3/4 the way done after 13 minutes-White not smooth, but a little undercooked Lunch,One of the things you can do is use the mini-recipe book that comes with this set. You could do little omelets, adding things like cooked meats, ham or bacon, cheeses or vegetables. For people watching their cholesterol you can also use egg white substitutes. You can certainly soft boil eggs as well, you don't have to hard-boil them. I did find a spoon helped release the eggs easier and you do want to use tongs to remove from the boiling water. With enjoying poached eggs on the weekend it's certainly less cleanup. No pan to wash, just wash the pods. I'd give it two thumbs up!                                                             Swedish Washcloths-A few years ago when we remodeled our bathroom I added some Scandinavian touches. I was looking for a few different things online and stumbled onto Swedish washcloths. I wasn't quite sure what they were just, so I just ordered one for a bathroom and really loved it! Basically it's a combination of an old-fashioned cellulose type sponge and fabric. You can wipe up almost anything with them, they rinse out great, and they absorb a huge amount of liquid. While I like cotton washcloths for my kitchen they just don't absorb any liquids. Sponges are small so this seemed to fill the bill. I keep one behind the faucet in our master bathroom for quick spills and wipes- Recently I was on Amazon placing an order and decided to buy some new ones and found the ones listed below. I bought a set of four, and they really do double duty as sponges/washcloths! You can get them a lots of different colors and designs. Ikea sells very inexpensive ones but they are plain with no pattern. You can throw them into the washer and we'll just let them air-dry and they last for several years. They will stain however so if you're mopping up anything like blueberries, grape juice or anything like that be aware, it may not wash out. Got to leave it to the Scandinavians to come up with a perfect solution!                                                            Planter $6.00, Grocery OutletThrifting Scores!I hit a thrift store on the way to an appointment after work and spotted these, perfect for the 2 grand babies, .99 cents each, like-new melamine-Brand new ceramic serving board with removable wood board, $5.99-Wood removed, love it! I also donated a box this weekend. More cleaning out!"},
{"title": "Getting Started With Permaculture", "date": "Mar 18, 2018", "text": "From Permaculturenews.orgGetting Started With Permaculture-I was thinking today that I have never blogged about permaculture. So to get started here's a quick intro into what permaculture is. Basically permaculture is a form of  lifestyle/gardening, that can combine land and various resources into a mutually beneficial system. It can include agriculture, water harvesting, building, forestry, animal systems, aquaculture and more. The term was first coined by Bill Mollison an Australian gardener. He was really the first leader of the concept, helping it go worldwide. Some of the real simple ideas are things that we have included in our little Homestead, like keeping chickens and using the leftover deep litter in our gardens. Harvesting rainwater then using that in our garden. We planted fruit trees, under the fruit trees we grow vegetation that keeps the fruit trees base cooler and retains water. There are lots of people that farm fish in tanks and use the water to feed their vegetables with the rich manure liquid. Those are just a few examples and lots of people are doing permaculture but don't know that's what it's actually called. There's lots of free information out there. I have included his starter book that I found extremely useful, explaining of the concepts simply-Click on photo for infoIf you'd like more advanced info if you're familiar with the ideas, this next book is also excellent- Click on photo for info"},

Snow and rain and cold. Then some brief sun with amazing blue skies. A good day to be inside! Luckily we're seeing signs of spring, bulbs coming up, crocus up, and other flowers/ground covers greening up-DaffodilsThe sun is peeking out, but more cold is on the way. The rest of the weekend and next week- lows in the 30's, high in the 40's. Several weeks ago I took off our flannel sheets, but left on the heavy comforter. Still too cold at night. The hens have really been using the \"sun room\" on the coop, too wet and muddy for them. Dave wanted to take it down, but I disagreed BIG TIME. It's too early, we still have to get thru this month, then April. For the backyard we got a great deal today- six  METAL (not cheap plastic) solar yard lamps for $20.00 at Costco-Will clean up soon, sad looking gardenThe cheap plastic ones don't hold up well with the 100 degrees in the summer, then down to possible zero degrees in the winter. They crack, split and wind up as trash after a year or two. These new ones are HEAVY, aluminum, copper and glass. We spread them around the back yard for some extra light. Nice! I think they'll last a very long time.Happy St. Patrick's Day!I'm part Irish so I love the showing/wearing of the green! Here's at look at some of the things in our home-Mini Irish flags with the spring sheepFront entry garlandCeltic wall hanging, a personal faveLiving room table, love my little pillowCorned Beef & Pesto Flat Iron Steak-Perfect day for corned beef that's currently cooking in the crock pot. I always make in on this holiday. I LOVE Irish potatoe soup, but it's too much carbs and Dave can't do much dairy anymore. I bought  a square cut, added lots of fresh garlic, black pepper corns, and the spice mix included. To serve I add taters, cabbage and carrots. Add some hot horseradish, mustard, and it's yummy. I bought an apple pie at Costco for dessert, since there's lots of little projects today. Tomorrow we're babysitting both River and Oliver. Two toddlers in the house = lots of eyes on. Not a day to get chores done. Great article here-Ultimate Corned Beef & Cabbage with a little history thrown in.I scored a couple of flat iron steaks a while back and froze. I made this basic recipe before (used my own pesto) Basil Pesto Flat Iron Steak It has tons of flavor, cooks fast, and great for a work night. A little salad on the side with buttered pasta. It's super juicy and has tons of flavor. This website has lots of great ideas for cooking beef, just scroll down thru the whole page-  Livestrong.com Blog Hop Mystery???Does anyone know what happened to The Simple Saturday Blog Hop? It seems to have disappeared off the planet. I emailed a couple of the hosts, with no response. Sad to see it go, but is it still out there? Thanks for any info if you have it!

While it still cool at night, the days are longer, and warmer. With daylight savings time gone into affect, we'll have even lighter evenings. Not happy about driving to work in the dark, again! Bulbs are coming up, tress are starting to bud. Great timing for the garden, and Dave bought me a surprise gift at Costco! It's a large outdoor wind spinner! I wanted one for Mother's Day last year, didn't get one, so Dave bought me one this year. It's in our backyard, love it!One side dark copperOther side dark copper/ silver-ishWe have had an unusual gardening/landscaping situation come up with the county widening our street. Basically we will lose two feet of our front property line facing the street  so that they can put in new sidewalks. On our street there are some sections with sidewalks, and some of the older sections are without. It will be a neighborhood improvement project. We think it's a great idea although some of the other neighbors aren't happy. We think it's nice for a side street to have safe sidewalks for residents and their children to walk on instead of having to dodge cars. We knew this was coming and get the paperwork today and will be receiving a nice chunk of money  in exchange for basically selling that area to the county. They will replace any fencing that has to be removed (then replaced) and our mailbox/post. We will use part of the money to replace plants in that section of the front yard. The nice thing is we were wanting to change a few things anyway. Since everything costs money we had put that on hold for a while.  We will find out soon when the project will actually start but we were thinking it's next winter. We'll call and find out the exact timing. As for spring, there's St. Patrick's day too! I bought a big slab of corned beef for next weekend, and a little something from Hobby Lobby, with more of the decor going up today-Laziness = Thrifting Deals! I have always found great clothing deals at thrift stores, but there's one odd thing. When it comes to clothing I can't imagine that people are just so lazy. I have found items with missing buttons, only to find an extra button inside the garment. I have found things with very light stains that came right out with a simple stain removing spray. I found  very expensive down vest with a small 3\" seam that had a gap, paid $4.00, sewed it closed, like new. I recently found these great jeans, fit perfect but the hems were all ragged. Someone's pants were obviously way too long, they walked around in them and ripped them all up. I bought them, measured them, and hemmed them up. Maybe 15 to 30 minutes tops, then washed. Now I basically have great jeans that I am currently wearing. I guess there's some people that didn't learn how to do any kind of basic sewing/clothing maintenance whether they are male or female? I know sometimes that I think Americans are basically lazy- mentally, emotionally, and physically. I guess I just don't get it. Maybe since I grew up hearing stories of the depression, and I take pride in my skill set, it bothers me. It does make for great shopping however! After shot-"},
{"title": "DIY Floating Cedar Shelf", "date": "Mar 5, 2018", "text": "DIY Floating Cedar Shelf-We painted our master bedroom a few weeks ago. When I was at Home Depot after that I had seen something cedar colored up against something gray, and it reminded me of the bedroom. I had wanted to do something that wasn't just more pictures on the wall. I started doing a little bit of browsing online, came up with the idea of having Dave build a floating Cedar shelf in the empty bedroom space. There's a short wall on my side of the bed between the outside corner wall and the window. I thought it would be a perfect place to float a shelf and add some decorative items on it-We bought a nicer quality finished cedar board (not fencing) with one side is very very smooth. One board was about $22, but since I found one that was split on the end they gave it to us for half price. Yeah! I wanted to make sure the wood we bought had one nice outside edge with no knots since that would be showing-Dave bought a couple of 3/4\" L brackets and small screws, found a studs and mounted the brackets-Close up of bracket, brass, Dave used one on the top/one on the bottom-Photo from Home Depot.comAfter he put the shelf in place I could tell that it was a little bit too deep. I had Dave rip off  about 1\" inch to make it narrower. Perfect size! I also asked Dave to round the corners of the board for safety purposes-Then he did a little bit of sanding with his palm sander. Once he got it up and installed it it looked great! Then I added the decorative items and it looks even better! They all have sentimental value like the feathers I found, the lighthouse trivet I found which reminds me of all our trips to the coast. I added a little fake plant I bought at Hobby Lobby for some natural color-    Anya approved!Total, about $13.00, including having leftover wood for other uses. I love it!"},

A furry friend even came up on the deck to score some cat food out for the neighbor's cat-Saturday morning, cold and snowing-I wanted to make an apple crisp, to use more of our home canned apples. Since I had a nice big bag of pecans in the freezer I added some to the mix. I used this doubled this basic recipe Martha Stewart Apple Crisp, added 1 cup raisins, nutmeg, then topped with about 1 1/2 cups chopped pecans. Baked up with a great crunch on top! After I took dessert out of the oven I made dinner, using one of the beef chuck roasts I bought on sale- I used this as a basic recipe Beef Pot Roast I added 4 large carrots, 2 small Yukon gold potatoes, 1 cup beef stock, with 2 Tsp Worcestershire sauce. Searing the meat FIRST is key! At the end I added 2 cups fresh mushrooms, then adjusted the seasoning before serving. I used my dutch oven enameled cast iron pot since I was home. Works great in a slow cooker as well!Gwynne (Welsh for white)Chicken Recovery Success-After my favorite hen became really ill and I doctored her up last week, I'm happy to report she's back to normal! I transitioned her back to the coop gradually over the weekend. The coop was closed due to the snow and I turned on the heat lamp for extra warmth. She ran out today for treats, spinach and bread, looking alert and happy. I think this was a good experience as far as using observational skills. When your animals seem OFF pay attention! You get to know their patterns of behavior, eating, etc. With attention and some TLC you can save yourself a lot of grief. We even got 2 eggs today! She must be laying again.Snow's melting"},

Recent comment here-Kate said...I would love to follow you, but, and please don't take this as an insult, it bothers me that you won't put a photo of yourself on your blog/facebook. It's like you want to connect with us, your readers, but you don't *really* want to connect. If I follow you, you'll see *my* face, right? I guess I like to see the person that I'm following and reading. Just something to think about.I've been blogging for 6 years, reached people all over the planet, and I've never had anyone complain that there wasn't a photo of me on my blog. Or on my new Facebook page. It's never been important to ME what people look like if I'm following their blog/Facebook. I'm there for content. I loved Mama Pea's old photo with a pot on her head and a mug of hot cocoa for instance! Having worked in technology for a very long time I tend to lean towards more privacy, but I know that's a novel concept for some people. I've addressed this before in this blog about why I don't post more photos of my adult children, grand children or other specifics. I know lots of other bloggers like that as well. I know there are a lot of people in the world who let it all hang out through social media and that's their choice. They post everything about everyone with no thought for whether it's appropriate, or permanent. Personally I abhor \"tagging\" and facial recognition. I mean who needs to know this stuff? Big brother?There are people who job hunt, for instance, who don't like the data that shows that potential employers will search your Facebook or other social media accounts. Those wacky photos of drunk and disorderly people, body parts hanging out, or worse, may not get them hired and then they wonder why? I've never really posted a photo of myself on this blog for a variety of reasons, mostly because I hate having my photos taken and I am sensitive about my appearance. If someone wants to see photos of me with the expectation that I'm 20 years old and a size one, sorry, not going to happen. There are some people that only want to socialize with people who look like them. Maybe they're from a certain racial/ethnic background, and are only comfortable with people that look similar. Or are the same same size, financial status, wear the same clothes? I could go on.Anyway if you want to know what I look like click on the Facebook tab on the right side bar ,go to my Facebook page and you will find out! And if you don't like it I guess you can just visualize and use your creative, right sided part of your brain. I do have blue eyes! And for laughs on hating having your photos taken read this hysterical article, all the way to the bottom! Buzzfeed.com Say CheeseENJOY!!!Nursing a Sick Chicken-Chickens can get sick at any time, for all kinds of reasons. Over the years I have dealt with worms, and hens just literally dropping dead for no apparent reason. With a small flock of three and all hand raised from chicks you can get attached! This week my favorite hen Gwynne was laying on the ground in 10 degree weather with bitter cold winds. Normally chickens will walk around outside or go into the coop. I went out and brought her in, her feet and combs were almost frozen. I warmed her up and set up my chicken hospital on my kitchen counter-Some leftover spaghetti (looks like worms!) and fishBasically I use 2 large laundry baskets, one on top of the other, with a thick towel. With food ad water, it's easy to just throw the towel in the washer when it gets soiled. After she warmed up she drank some water, ate some soft bread and applesauce, homemade of course! I noticed a little later she was heaving and breathing hard, and wheezing a little, no other symptoms. I started doing research and read about Vetrx, a natural remedy for poultry, with great reviews. Sadly no one locally sells it, so I ordered it online, still waiting-                                                                   In the mean time I had to do something. It was a good sign she was eating, but she was very lethargic. I decided to use my essential oils I already had. I used my Tea Tree oil mix I use on myself. I put a tiny amount on her wattles, and turned on my vaporizer with Eucalyptus oil.Vaporizer for essential oilsI kept her in overnight, she seemed to sleep a lot. The next day I had to go back to work, so I kept her inside. Her breathing was much better! Still lethargic, but eating some. We're on day 3 and put I put her out for the day yesterday, with the coop door closed due to steady snow. I didn't want her going outside and sitting there all day. I brought her in last night, she looked tired and didn't eat much. She slept. This morning I made her a scrambled egg and she ate some more fish. She dozes a lot, but seems to be getting some energy back. I debated putting her outside today, but with 8 degrees this morning, I'll keep her in. Tomorrow is the weekend so I may set up a bigger space inside where she can walk around. I have an old outdoor baby playpen I use for chicks. That would work great for the kitchen with some towels down. Time will tell, but she seems on the mend!"},

{"title": "Filling The Freezer, New Master Bedroom Paint Reveal, Thrifting Scores! Speaking Of Decorating", "date": "Feb 20, 2018", "text": "Filling The Freezer-Last time I mentioned our freezer was about 1/2 empty, so it was time to stock up. I thought since we had tax refund money I'd fill it up with meats. Food is always a good investment, with times being what they are, with a possible economic down turn coming. I started at Costco this weekend, bought really thick pork chops, and country style ribs, all for $30.00.  I split up the packs and bagged them for the freezer, 2 bags for each cut-The beef cuts weren't want I wanted, so I looked at other stores. Before I added the meats, I rotated some frozen fruits to the top, so I could see the better.Today I went shopping and bought this beef- two boneless chuck roasts, perfect for the slow cooker, total 6.5 lbs for $18.00 for both. Lots of meals there. Also two packages totaling 2 lb.s of flat iron steak for $12.00. I got the flat irons since they're great for a salad recipe I have. One package = 2 dinners, about $2.50+ per person. I may a couple of extra briskets, since they're hitting the stores for St. Patrick's Day. I don't know how this compares nationally as far as prices?New Master Bedroom Paint Reveal-Our peach wall paint from 10+ years ago needed a freshening and something lighter colored. Between low winter light, and heavy shade in the summer, the room is darker than we thought when I first painted. We loved the Behr Silverdrop 790C-2, a little darker than the Irish Mist we used in the master bathroom re-hab. It's a light gray and we went with it. Since we have sage green carpet and drapes we wanted something fairly neutral, but not beige or white. When I bought the primer/paint I bought 2 gallons. One might be pushing it and I would need to touch up later. Of course we used just under 1 gallon sigh. Good news we could re-tint it late if we wanted to use it. We bought all our supplies for under $100.00. Pretty cheap for a major update. We started about 10:30 a.m. Sunday by emptying the room, stripping the walls, vacuuming (under where the furniture was), and cleaning top of the windows and doors-Very peachy Nest we put down tarps on the floor, some canvas, then plastic. We also covered the bed with plastic- Gray walls starting- All the little cobwebs, etc. need to go to paint. I brought in a flor lamp form the other bedroom for extra light. First I spackled all the nails holes with lightweight spackle. Nice to have a clean slate. I had back problems from the last exterior house painting, so no twisting for me! I asked Dave to do the upper edges and floor areas. I did the upper trim, windows, doors, and 2 closet doors. That was a LOT of brush work! I went behind him when I finished those with the roller. Rolling on paint is is so much fun! Suddenly the wall is different. Instant gratification. Even though it was cold outside, we had the window open 1/2 way. Midway thru painting dark clouds, strong winds rolled in, and it started snowing \"corn snow\", time to close the window-A little later it was sunny-We finished the wall color faster than I thought, by about 12:30 p.m. Sunday. I asked Dave to paint the white baseboards, pretty beat up from years of use, and a messy job from me the 1st time. I offered to do the closest and door trim, but he wanted to do it all. I vetoed him. I did the upper closest, etc, while he worked below. I also painted the trim on the window. Monday I finished the small amount of touch up work. I also touched up a couple of spots, in the kitchen, hallway and bathroom, filling screw holes from things we've moved. I may get a new duvet cover at some point, but this will work for now. We rotated a few prints and we love it! Nice and fresh.Still loving the set I bought a few years ago over the bed-More wall art coming on Dave's side-Thrifting Scores!Since I was off today, some vacation for me, I went to Goodwill and the place was empty! Right off the bat I snagged a like-new pair of navy corduroy slacks for work and some jeans. The jeans just need a little hemming. I saw this pillar, new $7.99- I thought of this, cute with the nests on top, might paint it-From Confessionsofaplateaddict.blogspot.comDave and I really miss the Oregon coast and we've actually been to this lighthouse, at Heceta Head. These kinds of things are SO expensive in gift stores there, $1.99 here! I'll hang it somewhere-New table runner, $2.89, reversible-New soap dispenser for my bathroom, $3.00 to get rid of my ugly Costco bottle-Speaking Of Decorating-I just LOVED this display at the local Kneader's bakery and sandwich shop! We had dinner there last week when I was too exhausted to cook. I never would have thought of decorating with ferns. Great combo for St. Patrick's day, Spring and just for fun. They always do a great job with their decor, all for sale of course! So cute. Ironically I have the exact same green edged light wood frame at home already."},

Here in Boise he's spot on. The temps have plummeted, back into the 40's during the day, 20/30's at night. The forecast for this next week in highs in the 20's/30's, in the teens at night-We were blessed with some good snow fall in the mountains and foothills this week, with more on the way tonite. We REALLY need more snow pack up there. On the news last night we're at 65% of normal right now, not good. A good snow pack keeps things greener longer = a shorter fire season, adds more water to the reservoirs for the public and agribusiness. I had put away some heavy sweaters and gotten out some lighter spring work clothes. Good thing I have a spare closet, since sweaters are coming back out! I'm hoping these temperatures won't hurt the garden since some bulbs were just starting to come up, way too early. Oh well, what can you do? Everything is well mulched, so we should be good, hopefully.Independence days Challenge-Here's a little wrap up of recent things going on here-1. Plant Something- I found a sweet little thrift store pot, with tray, for $1.50, for transplanting my holiday gift from a work buddy, a spider plant, perfect in the kitchen!  2. Harvest Something- Eggs, that's it.3. Preserve/Store Something- Shopping this week, see below, freezing foods.4. Manage Reserves- Get a GoodDeal/Barter/Stock Up/Prep- Our freezer is almost 1/2 empty so time to stock up. I designated some tax refund money to \"fill the freezer\". I'm going shopping for meat basically to add. I'll be looking for good deals on beef roasts and chicken primarily. Most of what's in there now is fruits, veggies, breads, cheese/butter- Hole to fill- 5. Eat the Food- Try NewFoods/Recipe- I thawed some frozen pesto to day to use on some big chicken breast. For diner tonite! Last week I bought this at Cost Plus World Market for Mardi Gras/Valentine's Day dinners-Last year I used it with shrimp and veggies, this year I did chunks of chicken breast, peas and fresh spinach- Great served with warm french bread, spicy and tons of flavor!!! 6. Build Community Food Systems- Nothing7. Recycle/Re-Use- I just sold another item on Etsy, what fun! Nice Asian items that I don't need, at a great deal, to someone who wants them. Win-win. At Goodwill last week found thrift store pot, $1.50, great pair of Eddie Bauer like-new khaki slacks, $4.00. Found some great shoes on Overstock.com for work, cheap and free shipping.Dave gave me this Japanese style stoneware vase years ago, made by a Portland potter. I really loved it, but it didn't really go with anything so it just sat in my china cabinet. I wanted to re-do it, but make it reversible if I hated it. Here's the before- I decided to cover just the script (some on the other side too) and leave the rest alone. I wanted to use hot glue and jute. I found this at Joann's-Basically I started at the top back of the white clay and worked to the bottom-After- It's not perfect, but I really like it! I may add some flowers or branches, but I love the texture and the still-exposed blue glaze. Dave did give his approval before hand.8. Skill Up- I learned how to cover a vase.

When you live in high desert GREEN is a good thing. You don't want dry foothills and mountains too early, sigh. Here's hoping for either more snow for a while or LOTS of rain!Thrifting & More-I did some shopping this weekend and found some great goodies! I got the vase above for $1.25 at a thrift store, perfect for Valentine's Day! I put my Valentine's Day things out almost all thrifted-I added red faux flowers to the vase on the R after I took the photoMy vintage jar full of sparkly hearts and apples, blocks from Target, $1.0080% off one summerAnother cheap findI broke down and bought some NEW jeans this weekend, after not finding any for a while at thrift stores. I will say it's nice to go to a rack pull some new ones, try them on, buy and leave. Easy.I bought a new Target $10.00 front door mat, as ours was falling apart, goes great with the entry way. Nice and bright- After doing our taxes, and finding out we're getting a refund this year, I splurged on a piece of wall art at Joann's Fabrics, perfect for spring and summer over a side table I use in the living room-Wood frame, metal background, love it! I'm also going to a new bathroom faucet for my little bathroom, since the finish is shot and wearing out. We bought a cheap brand ten years ago, but that's what we bought. Now I'm looking for a good deal on a good brand, something like this-Before shotBedroom Painting SoonNext on the list of projects will be painting our master bedroom this month. I'm taking a couple vacation days off work to do the bedroom and touch up some other areas.  I was going to do it last summer, but with Dave's layoff I didn't want to spend the $. It's currently peach, but I'm going to paint it the same as our master bath, a very white gray. It looks very crisp and clean with white trim. Dave photo shopped this for me, but it's a little darker gray, but what a difference!!!Photoshopped after shotI'm was thinking about doing an accent wall behind the headboard with board and batten. I just don't know if it will work well with the existing furniture? I'm leaning towards a no. For the same price of materials, or less, I could buy a new medicine cabinet for our little bathroom. It's getting pretty funky, so I'm leaning towards that. Time will tell. Our \"little bathroom\" is actually a 1/2 bath \"master bath\" with the way our house is set up. The big bathroom is down the hall. We gutted it a few years ago when the floor was rotting from an old water leak. \"My bathroom\" is the little one. Dave uses the big bathroom primarily since we get up for work at the same time. Works great! I re-did the back splash and decorated, since the paint is in good shape. Now just a new faucet, maybe medicine cabinet and it will be \"done\" for now. Someday I'd like new flooring and counter, but it's good for now."},

We were supposes to wake u to 3 \" of snow yesterday (Saturday), but only had a few snowflakes mixed with rain. Today we had VERY dense fog in the morning, which burned off to a pretty fairly sunny day! It's 54 at 3:00 this afternoon. With a warm forecast for next week, I'm ready for spring! We went to Joann's Fabric yesterday for a few things. We put away all the winter decor yesterday and I put out my normal things. On the dining room shelf, I dded flowers on the top right from Joann's for a few dollars-I also found this thick wooden bird with a white hook, it's about 10\" wide, too cute! $5.00 I think. It's in the living room, and I may hang a little batch of my lavender on it-I had a pretty, ceramic clock who's mechanism had died. For $9.00 we bought the clock rehab kit at Joann's. We took off the old one, just unscrewed, then I wiped down the face- Added the new kit, problem solved!  Here on Amazon- $14.87Anya decided she would fill the empty coffee table basin, since it's now empty of the winter goodies. I mean- what more do you need! From Wikipedia.org 1939Origins Of The \"Keep Calm and ... \" Posters-Like everybody else I have see a lot of different versions of the poster above, personalized, on mugs, tee shirts, you name it. I thought it was from the 1940's, from WW Two It was actually from 1939, in Britain. Fascinating history here- Wikipedia.org Origins Keep Calm and Carry On. Link to a story of the couple who found a copy Telegraph.co.uk  Here's a link to a site where you can make your own, free! Make A Keep Calm PosterMinestrone Soup & Pesto Pasta w/Eggs-With snow in the forecast last weekend I decided to make some homemade minestrone soup. I found this recipe, pretty close to what I'd had Minestrone Soup . I used just kidney beans and skipped the zucchini. You can add extra pepper, or red pepper flakes, if you like some kick. This is a fast soup too! Serve with some Parmesan on top and hot bread. It's VERY healthy with lots of veggies and uses no meat.I had set out some homemade pesto made from my organic basil to make pasta with. I wanted to add some protein and was scratching my head. I brought in an egg from the coop and set it on the jar so it wouldn't roll of the counter. I had that eureka moment! Poached eggs on top of the pesto pasta! A little fresh Parmesan cheese, salad and bread. Perfect!"},

Independence Days Challenge, Free Essential Oils Class Starts This Week & Class Content", "date": "Jan 21, 2018", "text": "Wacky Weather!We have had some very wacky weather this last week! While the east coast and southeast has gotten hammered, we were lucky to have the mild version. A week with cold rain, a record high of 57 degrees, and snow forecast for tomorrow morning. It was 25 degrees last night and a sunny 42 today. We've had more of a \"normal\" winter with a little snow here and there. Since Boise is high desert, precipitation traditionally is about 11\" a year, but that varies. Boise is called \"the city of trees\", but it's only possible thru major irrigation. Most people here don't plant native type plants, just urban turf and trees, etc. I'd love to see more education on low water friendly landscaping that like the cities of Tucson and Albuquerque. The recent snow in the foothills and mountains is great, and while the emphasis is for skiers, I tend to look at the SNOW PACK. We need the water and don't want early fires with an early melt off. Time will tell. I have the girls out free ranging with the nice weather, they loved it! Since it was so warm it felt like spring to them as well. I heard them to the cold frame, and the area behind it, so they don't disturb our perennials-Digging under all those nice rotting leaves!What's under there?Independence Days Challenge-Here's a little breakdown down of some recent things we've been up to!1. Plant Something- Too early, but I'm looking thru seed catalogs.2. Harvest Something- Eggs, one or 2 per day, some days zero. New chicks coming this summer! I love getting new chicks, seeing how they grow, and develop their own personalities. It's great having a hatchery not too far from here. I had bad experiences with 2 different local feed stores- wrong labeling as to breed, and one died. No problems with the hatchery!3. Preserve/Store Something- Nope.4. Manage Reserves- Get a GoodDeal/Barter/Stock Up/Prep- I froze some artisan breads I bought at the Grocery Outlet. Bought whole grained breads, high protein shakes mix, veggies. Working on replenishing the freezer, since it's about 1/2 full right now. I stocked up on supplements, whole grain waffle mix and canned chicken breast meat at Costco yesterday. Dave got a price quote on a new set of glasses, much cheaper than where we had been going! We also got a price quote on new tires for my car, better deal as well. We bought Norton's software we buy yearly for our 2 PC's (local Staple's store) the antivirus, etc. Got a free utilities disk, MUCH cheaper than their online offerings! The utilities disk really deep cleans and speeds things up. It pays to shop around!!!5. Eat the Food- Try NewFoods/Recipe- I made a peach raspberry crumble (sorry no pics)  last weekend, with our own frozen peaches. We've been using our frozen tomatoes. I've been eating less wheat, sugar, junk. I'm modifying recipes as Dave as he has developed dairy issues. No more heavy dairy dishes for us. It's not too hard to do- think pizza with faux cheese, bread pudding with almond milk! I'm making a big pot of homemade minestrone soup today, great for the old weather.6. Build Community Food Systems- Nothing, wrong time of year for us.7. Recycle/Re-Use- Donating some framed art, holiday decor, since there's just too much stuff in the house. I added some baby items since both the grand babies are walking now! 8. Skill Up- I taught my first blogging class thru a local library. All I can say is- glad I took a paper outline I created, since there were multiple tech issues on their end.  Next time I will know what to check.

Homemade Chicken w/Biscuits & Gravy", "date": "Jan 13, 2018", "text": "DIY Floating Corner Shelves-It was 54 yesterday and felt like spring! WOW! I'm loving the sunny, mild weather for now. It's still winter so time will tell. I'm grateful we haven't have the terrible snow we had last year.  Last weekend Dave built the shelves I had been wanting. It got put off until after the holidays and babysitting. I first got the idea here- 4men1lady.com Corner Shelves I asked Dave to build some in our front corner hallway. He looked at the plans and he said it was VERY overbuilt. Since he's great at carpentry I trusted his design. We used lighter weight wood, saves $ and it's very sturdy. Don't waste your $ on heavy wood for such a small use project. Before we had a wire rack, that folds up, with a Swedish country shelf above. Dave took it all down before I could get a full shot, but here's the old one I had-Dave took everything down, we talked about how wide and high the shelves should be, then marked with painters tape-View down the hall-Sorry, kitty box showing!Next he leveled, then mounted the supports to the studs and nailed in, using his little nail gun. It worked great for this, no huge, messy holes!Supports all installedAdding shelvesWinter decor is up, daughter made the bowl and house in high schoolHere's the materials list we used, all about $25.00 locally-1/4 sheet of 1/4 \" Birch plywood for shelves, cut in triangles16' of 1\" x 3\" utility wood, he cut to 1/2\" for 32' for the braces25' quarter round for the top edge of the shelves, looks more finished12' finish grade 1\" x 3\" for front edgesNail gun nails, or use finish nailsFine sandpaper for the edges, just to smooth a bitYou could have a big box store cut the squares for you, but then you'd have to cut the triangles another way. At this point the wood is bare, since I wanted to see the color in the lighting. It was also too cold outside to do any painting. I may do a white wash on the wood, or a light pine stain. Haven't decided yet. That corner can be dark, but there's a light \"straw\" color on the walls. All I'd need to do is tape it off and throw down a small tarp. I'll do a clear coat of nothing else to protect the wood. I really love the size, perfect for the space. I'll spackle a couple of holes, touch up and call it good.

Yup, chicken and biscuits with gravy! There's tons of recipes out there and here's what I did. Cubed up leftover roasted chicken breast (skin removed), sauteed about 3/4 cup each fresh carrots, celery, salt, pepper, Thyme and butter. Once cooked I added flour to make a roux, then chicken broth, cook until thickened. Add about 1 cup of frozen peas and chicken. Cook until nice and hot. Serve on top of a biscuit! Yummy!"},
{"title": "Fun News & Updates, Garage Door Adventures, Easy Crab Meals, New Winter Chicken Fount", "date": "Jan 6, 2018", "text": "Fun News & Updates-As for news, you may have noticed this blog layout has been changed and rearranged. I saw some things I found annoying and thought it could be better! I have added another sidebar on the left, since the one on the right was WAY too long. Hopefully things are arranged so it's easier to find various sections now. I may eventually add more pages at the top, but that's too labor intensive for me right now. Juggling working full time and blogging can be a challenge at time. Since I work on a computer all day at work, the ideas of hours online on a work night isn't that appealing. At some point my eyes just need a rest! I also updated my blog header with some newer different photos. I tried to use a good cross section of shots. Hope you like the changes!I have recently joined the Homestead Bloggers Network and I'm looking forward to learning new things from more seasoned bloggers! It's amazing that I've been blogging about 6 years! How time flies! Six years ago I don't think there was a whole lot of bloggers networking. I's nice to see that now. I've been invited by the Meridian Public Library Mld.org/unbound to present a how-to-blog class Tuesday, Jan. 16th. I'm really excited! They reached out to me as a local blogger. Meridian is just outside Boise, and a large city. It's going to be lived streamed on their Facebook page Facebook.com/mldunbound I'm a little nervous live streaming a class (what could possibly go wrong?) but it's a great opportunity! I'm pumped!Garage Door Adventures-I really appreciate having an attached garage, and an overhead door with an opener. Just push a button in the car and presto, open door! After our overhead garage door had been squeaking really badly for a few months they've decided to buy some lubricants to fix it. The squeaking is gone thanks to this kind of DIY product Pro Garage Door Lubricant. Overhead garage doors need to be lubed once in a while, as well as balanced . They have a giant spring that needs to be serviced by a professional over time. Ours lasted 15 years, pretty average as far as I know-We hired the company that put the replacement spring last year to come back and check out why it didn't stay balanced. A balanced door is easy to raise up and down manually if you lose power or your motorized opener fails-Emergency pull, lift the balanced door easilyShort version- they put in the wrong sized spring last year, and didn't offer to fix it for free. So... we'll go back to the other company we've used and get it fixed correctly. Good example of poor customer service. If you don't do the job right the first time admit, then fix it.Easy Crab Meals-Once in a while I just want some crab! Maybe it's missing the Oregon coast? I bought a big can (16 oz?) of all crab claw meat for about $12.00, a lot I know. Since I buy it once about once I year I can live with it! I made the (top photo) crab salad with the following- 6 oz. of crab claw meat, tossed with a Costco kale salad mix with poppy seed dressing. Served with hot french bread, fabulous!The next dish I did last night was a version of this- San Francisco Crab Melt Sandwich I used whole grain bread (Dave's Killer my fave), no onions (out), added a Tsp of Worcestershire sauce, and used Swiss Cheese. Also fab! Both recipes are easy and fast on a work night. Nice for something different.New Winter Chicken Fount-After several years our heated dog water bowl finally died this week. With temps in the 20's at night the bowl was starting to ice over. I'm happy Dave did a hard wire job in the coop for this and the lights, much safer! We decided to get an enclosed water fount, helps to keep the dirt out. It was easy to set up, plug in and walk away! Now the girls have much cleaner water. Apparently research says that poultry will actually drink more water in the winter when it's heated. It's three gallons and this is what we bought locally at a feed store. Girls are slurping down as we speak, and I always add a little Bragg's organic cider vinegar to the water-"},

Miss curiosity-We think she was sunning herself!The snow got slushy, but was still pretty-Packed up the holiday goodies-We had a family dinner here last night and River loved his new book we gave him, he said  \"ooo\"! I made a hearty pasta sauce with our frozen, home-grown organic tomatoes, with Italian sausage on top of rotini pasta, salad, bread,and a blackberry/raspberry pie (store bought) rounded out the menu. We all had a great time!Stopped at Lowe's found some 60% off holiday mini cloches, $6.00 for 2, perfect for my kitchen window- We dropped off some donations to a thrift store of holiday decor, since I keep downsizing every year. I did score a Duplo truck for River to play with here and a stocking holder for one the grand kids for next year. I need one more then we're set. We packed up the Christmas things, leaving out the winter decor for a while. Tomorrow I'll fill in the gaps with the normal decor. We'll start the New Year with a wintry mix!

{"title": "Little Homestead Year End Review", "date": "Dec 28, 2017", "text": "Little Homestead Year End Review-I was reading last year's year in review 2016 Year and it was in fairly sharp contrast to this year. Last year we did a lot of structural building, home improvements, the normal other tasks as well. This year was different, no major home improvements, no big medical issues, just final recovery from thumb surgery, that was nice! I changed jobs within my company which was a much better fit. Dave got laid off his job, but we had the skill set to survive and not lose any money during the process. For the 49 days it lasted we had vacation/severance pay, extra food, cash and really cut expenses. It really reaffirmed the path we're on. We didn't take a vacation we had hoped for but squeezed in a couple of day trips.  I decided after blogging for many years to start bringing in some income from it. I became an Amazon affiliate. I've been invited recently by a local large public library In Meridian to do a class on blogging in January, so that will be fun! I hope to teach some urban homesteading classes next spring/summer, time will tell. There's a few things in the fire then. And now.... here's a little review of this last year!We started the year with SNOW, SNOW and more SNOW, Boise's Snowmageddon-And it did!Walk to the coop Dave shoveling the front drive, againNear record breaking snowfall hit Boise and the surrounding areas hard. Bitter cold and slippery conditions. Challenges but we survived and thankful we both had short commutes to work. I fell in a parking lot at work, luckily no major injuries. It was so pretty, but a lot of maintenance issues in the valley. This year Dave is driving much further, so am hoping for a calmer winter. We already have some snow this month of December, with a white Christmas!Christmas Day 2017We had another new addition to the family in Dec. 2016, Oliver-He joined River, his cousin, and became our second Grandchild. We called him the \"winter wizard\" since it started snowing when Angela went into labor, and kept going. We've spent a lot of time with him babysitting every other Saturday for a half day, while Mom and Dad worked. We're happy it's now going to a few hours every other Sunday. He's just starting to walk, what fun!River and Oliver having some summer funI had fun doing some thrift store shopping for them-I discovered Hygge, which fit in with my fondness for Scandinavian culture-We had pretty great food production this year, except for the tomatoes. With our cold, wet spring many of the nurseries had poor supplies of starts.  We had a good harvest of peppers, beans, herbs, kale, collard greens, apples, peaches and pears. Every year is different, I have learned that! We had a GREAT harvest of apples, peaches and pears- Peaches that I froze and cannedPeach jamsGreat apple harvest after the previous poor year, canned slices and applesauce  It was a great feeling filling up the canning rack and the freezerHens free rangingChillin' in the heat in the shadeSummer veggie gardenPumpkins and beansTook a day trip to McCall in the summer   Anniversary trip to McCall in the winter this timeSweetie pie Anya on her favorite blankie, againOn her favorite chair, againAnd in the basin"},

The basic recipe is for a plate of meats, cheese, olives and the FABULOUS Tapas Plate Marinated Chickpeas. Just slice, heat up the bread and it's dinner, or lunch. This salad is so good I always triple the recipe, since it keep well for a week or more. Good for a snack or a rerun of the Tapas diner. Simple ingredients. I even found some parsley under the snow!I decided to try a different method for a baked ham for last night- you start at 550 degrees for 20 minutes ONLY, then turn down the over to 325 degrees for 2 hours. You get a crispy, smoky skin! I used the recipe I found- 1 cup brown sugar, 1 tsp. cinnamon, 1/4 tsp nutmeg, 1/2 tsp dry mustard, pepper, mix. Rub onto ham, then preheat. Wonderful! I made butter egg noodles, ham with a sweet mustard, sauteed spinach, served with Lingonberries. A nod to the Swedes:) And the dessert. It was a nice quiet dinner with just the two of us for a change.For Christmas Eve dessert I made this Cranberry Cornmeal Torte-No margarine! Use butter and you don't need the whipped cream. Slight crunch to the crust with the cornmeal, keeps well. I'm making a second one today for our family Christmas dinner. I always use more cranberries than they advise, why not?"},

Aren't the holidays supposed to be fun and relaxing and spent with families? Or maybe do something to help others? When did it become all about making more stuff or buying more stuff to make the stuff with? When did we become so fixated on just accumulating or gifting more of the homemade kinds of things? I do love crafting, baking and re-purposing fun little items, but it seems to have gotten a bit compulsive. I think the idea of making things for fun has become a I can make more than you can or I can make better than you can competitive kind of thing. It seems to have taken the fun out of it, it's just so excessive. So the next time you think you need to make more stuff, just step away from your device :)Construction Ahead-You may seem some changes coming soon with the blog, so stay tuned!!!

Now we have two grand children up on their feet, wow how time flies! I'll be putting out winter decor this weekend, photos coming. It was really nice to take a breather between the holidays. Thanks to those of you who have joined us at Facebook! Nice to see some of you migrating over, and no worries if some of you aren't interested. So here we go...1. Plant Something- Sadly wrong time of year here. I did get the new Baker Creek Heirloom Seed catalog! Seeds galore!2. Harvest Something- Herb box still has survived the cold! Love fresh herbs in recipes.3. Preserve/Store Something- I read this article and never had thought of How To Can Water For Emergencies, great idea and a way to use empty/extra canning jars. 4. Manage Reserves- Get a GoodDeal/Barter/Stock Up/Prep- Bought some items at Costco. Been getting good monthly deals at the Natural Grocers Store with their monthly sales- organic free range eggs ($1.99), Dave's Killer bread ($2.50) , and organic apples ($1.99 lb). My lousy hens are still on strike! No eggs sadly. Babies in the spring will take care of that! I got a couple of calendars, one for a co-worker (Secret Santa) and one for my desk at work, huge selection-Mini Calendar from Calenders.com love it!5. Eat the Food- Try NewFoods/Recipe- I bought some cranberry/orange scones/biscotti at Costco yesterday. BIG, more like a sticky bun/scones. Great flavor! I made some more French style baked Eggs with french bread and veggies for dinner. Great on a cold night and cheap! I'm doing more egg recipes now that I have a good source. 6. Build Community Food Systems- Not this time of year. 7. Recycle/Re-Use- Re-used some cardboard boxes for mailing eBay items. We donated my used monitor to a high poverty school near Dave's job. They were thrilled to get it! I will be going through more winter/holiday decor to see what to give away. I just keep downsizing \"stuff\" and it great not to have to store so much.

I did some research online, took off the head, sprayed with Lime Away and let sit. I rinsed, filled up the mop and boy did it steam!!!

There's that gray area between a cold/upper respiratory infection and Influenza. You actually need a Flu \"test\" to determine what you have. I have learned over the years to take vitamin D3 year round to boost my immune system. Because I have asthma I can get NASTY bronchitis, closing the airway and making for a terrible time. A few years back a friend started to teach me about using essential oils. I started using her \"recipe\" as soon as I felt any symptoms coming on. I mix 2 Tbl of a plain \"carrier oil\", I use sweet almond massage oil, and 16 drops of Organic Tea Tree oil. Mix well in a little bottle. The massage oil was about $10.00 for a big bottle, Tea Tree oil about $8.00, enough to last a few years. Monday at work I started sneezing really badly all day, glands started to swell, nose was closing up. That night after I showered I rubbed the oil mixture on the pads of both feet, including between the toes. I also rubbed it into my throat glands and under my nose. I slept really well about half the night. I woke up really headachy about 3 a.m., tossed and turned until 6 a.m.then called in sick. I slept until 10, got up, no energy, still had the headache, no appetite. I always keep some Boiron Oscillococcinum for Flu-like Symptoms on hand which has helped both Dave and I many times. I also have Boiron Homeopathic Cold Calm Tablets for Colds always stocked in our hall closet. I decided to do something different and I took BOTH, not together, but spaced out a bit. I rested, drank liquids and parked with kitty Anya in front of Netflix. By dinner time, I was able to eat a light dinner and sinuses had backed way off! Slept much better hat night. Since I couldn't quite tell if it was \"flu\" vs a \"cold\" I had treated both. Homeopathy is such a great blessing to health. Read up on it if interested and I HIGHLY recommend you keep these on hand during flu season. No side affects, works great, just do your own research before using.  Be responsible. As of today, Friday I feel like I'm back to 90% normal! No antibiotics or steroids as in the past. Happy dance!"},

It must have poured all night from the look of the fencing. It's really windy, but the sun is coming out this afternoon. I put out extra wild bird food for the local critters and they're eating. We had a gorgeous sunset a couple of nights ago- Dave wanted to get me something for my birthday. I really couldn't think of anything, but the one thing that would make my life easier was a new monitor, mine was pretty small. With aging eyes, it's harder. Dave found a 75% off deal and I love it! My old one was 18, new one is 22\", here's a side by side-Big difference, much easier to use!I just found out that tonight will be extra special, CBS news said-  \"The supermoon\" will illuminate the night sky on Sunday, December 3, when the moon will appear about 14% bigger and 30% brighter than other full moons. This is the first of three supermoons in a trilogy that will continue on in January.\" via Twitter. Cool!Chocolate Chip Bread Pudding w/Almond Milk-I had some Brioche bread (Trader Joe's) left over from Thanksgiving weekend, bittersweet chocolate, walnuts and lots of eggs. So... it was bread pudding time! Since Dave has developed a sensitivity to too much dairy, I used 1/2 Almond Milk. Next time I will use 100% since it came out amazing, just perfect for a cold night.Recipe- 1 loaf Brioche?Challah bread, cut into 1\" cubes, about 8 cups10 eggs2 cups Almond Mix2 cups milk1/2 sugar plus 2 TBS1/2- 1 cup Guittard bittersweet baking chocolate, chopped, love that brand!!!1/2- 1 cup chopped walnuts2 tsp. vanilla extractpinch saltButter 2 qt. baking dish, fill with bread cubes. Preheat oven to 375 degrees. In large bowl beat eggs, salt, liquids, 1/2 cup sugar. Mix in choc chips and nuts into bread cubes- I put about 1/2 in the middle and 1/2 on top. Slowly our egg mixture over bread. Let sit overnight (for best results). Sometimes I bake right away, if so, push liquids into the bread gently. Sprinkle bread with remaining sugar and put in oven. Bake 1 hour, remove and cover with foil, bake an additional 25 minutes, or until a knife comes out clean. Cool and enjoy! If you're a real chocoholic, add coarsely chopped gourmet dark chocolate! And double the nuts! Enjoy! You can also sub chopped apples, cinnamon, nutmeg for a fruit version.Solar Charger Review-I recent bought a Floureon Cell Device Solar Charger  It comes with one USB cord, a LED flashlight, and SOS flasher. Waterproof and small, the size of a cell phone, but a little thicker-FrontBack, has clip and compass/keyringYou can charge up to 3 devices simultaneously! I did 2-I have to use a wireless charger as my plug-in port died, worked great!VERY bright LED flashlight, can also flash SOS in Morse code, handy!There are so MANY applications for this- keep in your car on trips, hiking, hunting, cross country trips, emergency preparedness, you name it. You might not have a cell signal if there's a real crisis, but there might be info on your phone you'd still need. A great deal, $16.99, I LOVE IT!!!Mini Sink Makeover-All of this was less than $10.00 and I like it! love our white cast iron sink we bought a few years back, during our kitchen re-do, but I don't like this, the side sink strainer, hard to keep clean and I rarely plug this sink. This just kept bugging me-I was on Amazon buying a belt for Dave and I found this- NITO Stainless Steel Sink Strainer, it's effective and simple, $5.00-It has a depression, is easy to lift and empty. The garbage disposal strainer, ditto- this was the 2nd one I'd bought, kept staining-I spotted this Danco Garbage Disposal Strainer, $4.00, black, domed, and antimicrobial-"},

Chicken Sun Room In Action", "date": "Nov 25, 2017", "text": "Anya winding downWinding Down, No Christmas Yet-I was thrilled to get off work at noon Wednesday, since I had the afternoon to prep for turkey day. I LOVE 4 day weekends! After a whirlwind Thanksgiving day here, it was nice to have yesterday to myself. Sadly Dave had to work. I worked on various projects, including my blog. I'll be putting away the Autumn and Thanksgiving decor this weekend. Next weekend I'll put out some Winter decor. It's my birthday weekend too! I REALLY don't like the American emphasis on binging on shopping, putting up Christmas decor after Halloween, and radio stations are the worst. A week before Thanksgiving I was hearing Christmas music. Sad and aggravating. Christmas, when I was a kid, was a tree, simple gifts, going to church and time with family. No black Friday, no knocking people out of the way for gifts. One possible GOOD side affect of Internet shopping is maybe the stores will do away with that. Maybe. I really appreciate the simplicity of the way Europeans celebrate holidays, bringing nature inside and less materialism. So I'm not putting up anything Christmas-y for at least another week or two. With lows forecast in the 20's at night this week, we put on our flannel sheets and plugged in the heated birdbath (thrifted). The coop is done, Dave raked more leaves today, cleaned the mower for the season and stores. I put away the garden bench tools and covered it with plastic sheeting for the winter. It sits on our deck year round, next Spring I'll repaint it to freshen it up.Now on Facebook! I decided recently to take the plunge and start a Little Homestead Facebook page. I'll be adding extra content on a regular basis. Please hit the sidebar to follow to see what we're up to! Thanks!!!Chicken Sun Room In Action-After a heavy rain Thursday night, the girls really enjoyed the drier sun room yesterday and today! Dave added pine shavings later today for odor control. It's made from recycled materials, Dave built the frame, and we just dis-assemble each spring and store. Nice and dry, with a great view. There's a door inside the coop that goes into it. Sturdy and a great extra space for the girls!Neighbor kitty Posey stopped by for a petBetter shot  I found my photo of Thanksgiving in 2014, snowy!Sun room covered in snow, but dry and warm inside for the hensGirls came out for some rolled oats, a fave treat, from the left- Rosie, Gwynne, EllieHeated birdbath ready for winter!

It was 65 degrees! Four years ago we had 2 feet of snow on the ground. Usually it's nice and cool, instead I had all the kitchen windows open, and the ceiling fan on in the living room. Looks like the East coast had the cold. My 2 grand babies had a great time playing together, and our kids brought lots of yummy sides dishes. Babies were falling asleep heading home from all the food and activities. A fun time was had by all! Sorry no pics, I was busy! I'm really thankful that we could all be together this year. You never know what the future will bring.Anniversary Road Trip-Dave and I went to McCall, Idaho for our 24th anniversary last weekend. It was gorgeous, cold and clear! Due to a variety of things we've haven't had a real vacation in over 2 years. We went up Saturday morning and stayed the night. We came home Sunday afternoon. We stayed at the historic McCall Lodge right near Payette Lake-We had a really nice room, and my favorite features was the very deep jetted tub. My aging bones appreciated a very hot soak! It was really quiet, with a king sized bed. We had time to drive around the area, had a great dinner out and fun breakfast. It was really nice to have a rest break. Since they had cable I found a really cool show- Discovery.com Homestead Rescue The 3 person team, Dad, son and daughter help off-grid folks. Pretty interesting \"rescues\".Here's some nice shots near the lake-Brundage ski runs at the topSo calm!A bit of snowSweet little mossBoats docks covered with snowSki runs still thinPlanting Fruit Trees-I was looking at my lovely frozen organic peaches and canned apples that we grew this year. It's great having bumper crops and knowing how to preserve them! I knew I wanted to plant fruit trees once we moved into our small house, with our standard city lot. We had a few fruit trees at our last house, which was a 1/3 acre lot. Here at this house we started with an apple tree and a nectarine tree. Oddly enough I couldn't find one stinking peach tree in this entire town that spring! Go figure. A few years later we later planted a pear tree. After we lost our nectarine tree we decided to plant a peach tree, finally. It's such a small investment of money for the eventual long term harvest you will have. What a great investment. It's take some planning- where will it go, how high will it reach, how will you harvest, what exposure do you have, what variety do you want, etc. There's a ton of material online, but I found two great little books with lots of ideas from planting to pruning, if you want to plant some fruit trees!Grow a Little Fruit Treeand Growing Urban Orchards"},

After digging a bit I found it was back in 2012! I was looking at my Sharon Astyk books Adapting Our Homes and Our Lives to Settle in Place (Mother Earth News Books for Wiser Living) and Independence Days: A Guide to Sustainable Food Storage & Preservation , have read these books several times, and they still inspire me! There are so MANY great ideas on doing what you can, where you are! Links are on my side bar for more info. Since life is a process I find the ideas can be adapted over time really well. With variations in space, money you can invest, time you have they're great resources. My original post is here 2012 Independence Days Challenge Ideas and to think it was 5 years ago, how time flies!  I still love looking at this list and thinking about what we've done, and what we still need to work on. I did modify it a bit after reading how some other websites re-worded it just a bit, but you get the idea-1. Plant Something-2. Harvest Something-3. Preserve/Store Something-4. Manage Reserves- Get a GoodDeal/Barter/Stock Up/Prep-5. Eat the Food- Try NewFoods/Recipe-6. Build Community Food Systems-7. Recycle/Re-Use-8. Skill Up-9.

Dave put the sun room for the coop back together for the winter.  We didn't last year, and it snowed, several feet! It's ready now-Flashlights in the cars with fresh batteries, new rechargeable batteries in the solar garden lights.I just ordered one of these FLOUREON Portable Solar Battery Charger only $16.99!

With our coldest week so far I was ready for a big pot of chili! Over the years I stopped using meat since this is cheaper AND healthier. I made a big pot today-I use- 6 cans Light Red Kidney beans, 2 Lg bell peppers diced, 2 can diced tomatoes, 2 yellow onions diced, 3 cups of my own diced tomatoes, 2 cans water. I used about 4 TBL Chili powder (to taste heat-wise), 1 Tsp. Thyme, 2 Tsp. Garlic powder, about 1 TBL Cumin, and salt to taste. Basically put everything in a pot, cook for a few hours until nice and tasty. Adjust spices, or type of beans, as needed. I added more Chili powder near the end. Serve with any kind of toppings you like- sour cream, avocado, grated cheese, diced onions, cilantro, tortilla strips, you name it! We went with a little cheese. Cilantro or diced green onions would be nice too. Freezes great!The leaves have really been falling, and Dave moved the yards today, composting the leaves-Grand baby Oliver watching the leaves fall   Squirrels and birds have been out eating the bird foodTelepathic Chickens- No Eggs Mean New Chicks!I started this post earlier this week, then my telepathic chickens laid 4 eggs in the last 3 days! Go figure, they read my mind:) They haven't laid in weeks and weeks, even with extra protein. They're getting a little older, and at least one has been molting. Anyway, there WILL be more chicks in the spring/summer next year. So... After our three hens have laid really well for years, it seems they are done. It's been store bought eggs lately. On the bright side, that mean new chicks! I will get three again, early next summer to add to the flock. Last time it went really well integrating the new birds, so I'm confident I can do it again. It's always so much fun getting new chicks! You get to think about breeds and then a trip to the local hatchery. We go to Dunlap Hatchery in Caldwell (outside Boise) since they are really reliable with sexing the chicks (gender), the breeds are correctly labeled, and they're really healthy. Since we only buy pullets (female chicks) it's important that they're sexed correctly. We don't want any roosters. Here's our two fluffy balls from a few years back, and the Grand kids will love the new ones! We ALWAYS keep our other older hens. They eat bugs, weeds and keep an eye on things. I have integrated flocks before and can do it again.Living room visitHow cute!I'm leaning towards breeds we've had before Black/Gold Sex links and maybe something different. List of breeds we can choose from here Laying Breeds Then we'll make our fun run, pick up the chicks. So exciting! We set up in indoor mini brooder holding area. We use a laundry basket to start, lined with paper towels. Next we graduate to a long cardboard box with pine shavings. I've never been fan of indoor heat lamps, although we've used them. They can be a real fire hazard, but I finally found a solution that has good reviews and seems to work. I was excited to find out about a the Chick Heating Pad, 9\" by 12\", good indoors or out, chew proof, low energy use-Our last flock (one was a little rooster we re-homed), SO CUTE!!!"},

Winter Is Here & The Last Roses, Cheap Reads For You Reading Fans", "date": "Nov 4, 2017", "text": "Amazing Cheap DIY Shoe Repair! This spring I bought these really cute shoes on eBay. I love Haflinger shoes, but they are VERY expensive, made in Germany. I love the fact you can resole them. The other 2 like-news pairs I have I also bought on eBay. The eBay photos showed some discoloring on the soles. When they arrived the darker part was sort of brittle, like they been exposed to heat? I decided to keep them, and stashed until this fall. I wore them for the first time last week, and over the course of the day they developed hairline cracks on the discolored area. The hard part was also slippery on bare floors, a safety issue-What to do? Since the shoes were actually new (perfect otherwise) I called a local shoe repair store. I tried twice to find them, but couldn't. I stumbled onto a product that was a DIY shoe repair. After reading a LOT of reviews I thought I'd try it. I bought this Shoe Goo for $6.00 at a local fabric store, and boy does it work!!!I read the directions very carefully. Use in a WELL ventilated area, and clean the soles. I used a craft stick, like a tongue depressor, and worked on a thin coat. I basically did a pea sized blob and applied, like frosting a cake. I bought the clear. All the reviews said go thin, then build up. I worked out in our garage-I let cure (as directed) for a couple days. I found one tiny crack I missed so I will go over that. I only used 1/4 or so of one tube, so I have leftover Goo. So far love it! I wore them today, no more slippery soles. All in all I HIGHLY recommend this. People also use it for waterproofing things, so it's a flexible product. You can read reviews online.I also discovered another great, low cost product! While I was on Amazon, buying Dave a refill for his electric razor (cheaper than blades) I found this Bench Scraper- Great for the holiday season for cleaning up cookie dough too!I bought the marine blue, like a tealI had been seeing these for a while on cooking shows. Great for chopping and moving fruits, veggies, pastry, etc. Most of the ones I saw were WAY over my budget. I just needed to stop leaving a trail of food on my kitchen floor! You know how you chop, scoop things up in you hands, walk to the stove, leaving a trail? That's me, multiple times. So I bought one, and it's great! They come in multiple colors, perfect! It sits by my sink now, ready to grab. No more food trails!Winter Is Here & The Last Roses-Winter is here! It was 32 this morning, with lots of snow in the foothills. Today we added more pine shavings to the coop, bought and put out more wild bird food, cleaned off the last of the flower pots on the deck. Last night it was 45 degrees and pouring rain. I went out and clipped our last roses-Covered with rain dropsI trimmed them a bit and put in a Mason jar-The smell is heavenly!With tons of leaves on the ground, some pretty golden brown Ground Doves landed on the deck today.

Anyway, here's the \"before\" picture-  Hazy and wornShiny and clear! Worked great!"},

The winter comforter is on our bed and we're doing our outdoor winter prep. Starting to store flowers pots inside, doing the last watering/turf fertilizing, picking the last green tomatoes this weekend. My days of wearing a sweater to work will be coming to an end. Time for coats, hats, gloves. Anya has taken to digging herself under the spare bed comforter. See the lump?Kitty caveThe wind has really picked up today, with gorgeous blue sky. Looks like summer until you go outside, brrr! Last week we had a torrential downpour for 2 days-Banana Bread w/Buttermilk & Brown Sugar-Since I had six frozen mushy bananas, it was time for my fall treat. I'm not a pumpkin fan at all, so I make this! I found a new recipe, with buttermilk, Banana Bread w/Buttermilk & Brown Sugar, Walnuts I thought it might cut the sweetness of the bananas. The sprinkling of some raw sugar on top had a nice crunch and shine! I also added raisens. We worked on one (still some left) and the other is in the freezer. It keeps really well in double plastic bags.I also made this again- Vietnamese Pork Chops w/Radish Salad. The chops come out really juicy! Pretty fast to make, since I did it on a work night.

The forecast had been for quite a bit of rain. Happy they were wrong! Cool, breezy and perfect fall weather. Jeans and flannel shirt weather! A little heat on in the morning, nice by evening. I put the comforter on the bed, switched out some work clothes. When I retire my wardrobe will be much smaller! Shorts and tee shirts for summer, flannel/fleece tops and jeans for winter. I'm a low maintenance gal by choice. Trees are starting to change color-Deck flowers are blooming more with the cooler weather!Anya always remembers the heating vents are , when it cools down-Independence Days-Here's a recent list of things we've done recently...1. Plant Something- My two small lavenders, now that the heat subsided. We don't do \"fall planting\" here basically, the weather's too erratic. Yesterday was 78, today 63, dropped 20 degrees in two days.2. Harvest Something- Several kinds of peppers, tomatoes ditto, except most of the red ones, still green. Eggs, herbs.3. Preserve/Store Something- Froze sale artisan breads ($1.99! each), frozen lunches, salami, pesto.4. Manage Reserves- Get a GoodDeal/Barter/Stock Up/Prep- I went to the Grocery Outlet on my way home from work and got some really great deals again. Italian bread, dry salami, frozen organic lunches, hair conditioner, protein sticks, Danish Jam, 2 HUGE acorn squash (.50 each), I had to get this little guy cause he was just too cute, $1.50, and solid wood- 5. Eat the Food- Try NewFoods/Recipe- I received my cookbook from the Library, with tons of great recipes. Here's a few I want to try, many including Kefir-Kinds of like pancakes but very differentFried flat breads with FetaFermented tomatoes! Who knew???I had a $10.00 free coupon from Cost Plus and bought two of these to try-They're lean pork, smoked over actual wood, brine-packed, and shelf stable. It's the Meica Frankfurter , and more info here- Germanfoods.org I want to try with some kraut for a quick meal. I like the fact they're smoked over wood and not just smoke flavored. 6. Build Community Food Systems- I got several pounds of dead ripe tomatoes from a patient at our clinic. May not be organic, but delish! Especially since mine aren't ripening too well. I may have to ripen mine indoors depending on the upcoming weather. I made a nice batch of fresh salsa! I also used some with several home grown peppers, Italian bread, salami and a little cheese-Dinner!7. Recycle/Re-Use- I cleaned up our old camping wash basin (now vintage!) that we bought years ago at a yard sale. It had been stored in the garage and I realized it would be perfect for seasonal items on our coffee table. It's funny how you buy someone's old basin for camping, years later it's \"shabby chic\" decor!Faux squash/pumpkins from Hobby Lobby, $2.00, Home Depot burlap pumpkin, left over school paper leaves8. Skill Up- Learning about Eastern European cooking. I watched Part one and two of How To Stay Young  on PBS. I think it's on YouTube too. REALLY fascinating stuff!!! Very useful information. 9. Regenerate What is Lost/SalvageSomething- Brought in some peppers that are supposed to redden (Italian) to ripen indoors. Too chilly right now. Leaving the rest on the vine to observe. Re-tailored some slacks that had stretched out, just took in the waist. They fit now!Grand Toddler River-We had the pleasure of having River here for a while today. We don't see him as much as we used to for job change reasons. We're doing an over-nighter next week, while his parents take the night off for their anniversary. He's a great eater, is walking and very good at entertaining himself. He loves everybody and has always been a very loving child. He had a snack, a home baked blueberry muffin, but was a bit tired. He soon took a nice nap then woke up. More snacks, then playtime!Exploring the backyard for the first time walking-Running to GrandpaSitting on the deck in the BIG chairSitting in his own (thrifted) folding chairChecking out the pondWe babysit our other Grand baby Oliver every other Saturday morning thru early afternoon.

With colder weather gradually settling in it's time to look at the components of winterizing our coop. Dave was cleaning the outside house windows with our handy Windex scrubber. I had him do the upper coop window. It's recycled and we open and close as needed. There's hardware cloth inside the window where a screen would be. Below the window is a frame I had Dave build with hardware cloth. We use it in the warm weather for lots of good airflow and ventilation. In the late fall we pop it out and put in anther (recycled) window. We'll remove the tomatoes first, see below- We also have a screen in our $10.00 Habitat for Humanity store door. I leave it uncovered until it gets really cold, then I staple plastic over it on the inside. I can open as needed if it warms up-Note another area below the nesting box, open all yearThere's a vent in the roof of the coop for more air. It's a flexible system and work well for us and \"the girls\".

I went to the local fabric store with a washcloth and bought matching thread. I set up the sewing machine, all better, for $1.50 spool of thread-Easy Pear Blackberry Tart-I had the last six of our pears left, so I bought some puff pastry at for about $3.00 at Trader Joe's. I thawed, unrolled, rolled the edges, put on parchment, sprinkled with cinnamon/sugar. Topped with our pears, and some frozen homegrown blackberries. More cinnamon/sugar, baked for 25 mutes, perfection! I topped mine with TJ's custard ice cream, heavenly! I will do the next batch with some of our peaches :)  Easy, low cost, fast dessert!!!!"},

{"title": " My French Scandinavian Country Decor, Happy Rainy Week, Pesto, Pickled Eggs & Pear Pie", "date": "Sep 18, 2017", "text": "My French Scandinavian Country Decor-Over the years some of my readers have complimented my home decor style. While it's not my focus on this blog, I thought I'd share some things. First I want to say that not EVERYTHING in my home falls into a specific category. Some people have a clear sense of what kind of decor they like. Some people evolve over time. As I got older I realized I like older things with a patina, simple designs and sturdiness. I love some painted furniture, but also love the look of real wood. While I like SOME of the painted furniture craze, I also think it's a shame some people are painting over some antiques or amazing wood. I'm not a fan of the DIY chipped paint craze either. Trends will come and go, but a gorgeous piece of furniture, or an old print, will just get better with time. I have really gravitated over the years to vintage, country decor. There are tons of articles online about what is French country, Swedish country, farm/prairie style, etc. I like the warm woods, rustic feel, colors and other natural elements. I love the clean, natural looks of Scandinavian country, but I don't live there, so I will never have all white interiors. That great when you have 24 hours of darkness for months! I enjoy our warm wall colors- soft yellow in the kitchen, \"straw\" in the living room/hallway. My bedrooms aren't as focused on decor, and my master bedroom paint job has been out on hold. Hoping for next spring. Here's a look at some of the more specific things many thrifted! The print at the top of the page is my antique framed printed called The Angelus by Millet. It was my Aunts and I always told her how much I loved it. Years later she gave it to me. It hangs in my living room over my couch. Here's some of the other things in my home, maybe you'll get some ideas? Here we go, starting in the kitchen/dining room, sorry I don't have sorted by room-Thrifted print, love the motif and colorsOur 2 French country dining chairs, from a consignment shop, a \"spider web\" back, love them!Big substantial legs of our French country thrifted tableDining table, bird in the pot with the ivy, natural elements again, rag runner made from old sarisHomemade faux lavender wreathShelf with French elements- mirror, silver, Polish teapots, fun chicken!Old vintage window I bought 15 years or so ago, $10.00, nice focal point, fit perfect over the deskI made the lemon topiary, very French!Also upcycled the sifter into a topiary, added some acorns for fallLarge armoire we bought also at the consignment shop, very solid woodFlea market find, recycled barn wood bookcase, Thrifted small entertainment center, all wood, chalk painted side tableGrain sack style chair slipcovers, durable and washable!Side table, fall items, chicken, old kerosene brooder heater and faux greenhouseWW 1 era photo of my beloved Grandfather Alva, on top of Mt.

I woke up today and it's raining! How wonderful and it's in the forecast all week. Between all the smoke from fires, the heat and dust we're all ready. Next weekend will be nice, cool and dry. I've been putting out fall decor and swapping some clothes/shoes. Nice to see the hot summer come to an end...From the summer garden- fresh tomatoes, basil, Costco fresh Mozz, italian meatsPesto, Pickled Eggs & Pear Tart-The three P's! While these don't go together I decide to do one post. My Basil did great in one pot, not so much the other. No more ceramic pots in the intense heat. I bought lemons, garlic, Parmesan cheese, bulk pine nuts (much cheaper!), then I bought out my food processor and went to town. I made two quadruple batches. That gave me 6 nice jars, with some basil still left outside. I always use Rosie's Pesto Recipe It's great to rub on chicken and roast, on pizza, pasta, french bread.I love pickled eggs once in a while. They keep well for months in the fridge. I have made spicy ones before, with jalapeno slices. I went for regular this time Easy Classic Pickled Eggs.  Be aware this recipe makes WAY too much brine. I threw at least 1/2 out. For 10 eggs (2 didn't peel well) in a one Qt. jar, it's too much. Hard boil, peel then pickle, easy! I bought some organic store eggs, since mine will NEVER peel! Now they're resting in the fridge for a few weeks...Our wonderful organic pears have ripened inside and were amazing. They were just too many for the two of use, even with giving some away. I was done canning and so time to bake! I wanted  to try this a basic struesel topped pear pie, but I eliminated the bottom crust, no need for the fat! I also want the fruit to be the star! Thespruce.com had a quick recipe. I did use walnuts, since I them them on hand. Smells great!"},

Soon it will be time for coats, gloves and turning on the furnace!I finally used up the last of the box of our fresh apples make a big 8\" x 12\" baking pan 'pie'. I had some ready-made crust in the freezer, so I used it for the topping. I used a basic apple pie recipe, but added about 1 cup of walnuts, and 1/2 cup dark raisins for something different. A little over browned, but tasted great! I still use my classic Good Housekeeping Illustrated Cookbook for basic ideas. I love Pinterest too! The rest of the apples are canned, a great feeling to have food on hand that we grew for the coming next year!!!Volunteer Pumpkins from compostGarden Progress-I think in the old vernacular this is \"high summer\", everything is big and lush! Everything is producing and abundant. Sunday was gorgeous, 75 and breezy, perfect for gardening! Dave ripped out the mildewy beans, while I did a major thinning of the tomatoes. They were so thick they were all growing together! I trimmed and thinned. Thankfully our city now has composting big bins. We filled it up! Dave also pruned the blackberries, always a nasty job. Our tomatoes got a slow start due to bad weather in the N.W. late spring, creating limited choices in the nurseries. We always buy starts, so we wound up having to buy smaller plants than usual, thus the later harvest, but our peppers did great! We just harvested our pears this last weekend about 2 Dozen-Here's a tour of the garden, mostly the food producing one-A new hot pepper (for salsa) the Bulgarian Carrot pepper, pretty! Hot?

Our pond trumpet spout kept falling over even with some rocks holding it in place. Recently he thought of using a plastic tote from our dishwasher pods. He drilled some holes, added a clamp attached the black filer, and sat in the pond. It filled with water and now it's stable! Love free fixes! Free Pet Food-We buy our Science Diet cat food at a local Petsmart store. A while back we started receiving these coupon/cards periodically, for \"up to a 16 (big!) pound bag\" of their cat food. Scored a $35.00 bag of food!!! Stashed for later use. Score!"},

Praying for some storms to come thru the NW and start calming these down. I'm staying in as much as possible because the air is so bad...As a teenager one of my all time favorite things on WW toast was apple butter, peanut butter and sliced bananas. Now I leave out the bananas! A few years ago I made apple butter and the flavor was really nice. I decided to make some again. After the last 2 days canning marathon I was sore and tired. Dave went to work today and I slept in. I ran some errands, got a haircut and came home. I had one box of apples reserved for apple butter and a cobbler. After I came home I started cutting and prepping. I ran thru the food processor again. I forgot to leave out my fine strainer, so I just ran it as chunky. After it cooked a bit I used my immersion blender and that really smoothed it out. Its not quite as fine as I'd like but the flavor is really yummy. I used a standard Ball Blue Book recipe, but used 1/2 the white sugar with 1/2 brown sugar, and spices. Nice and brown, cooked down, and used the inversion method. It's never failed me so far. The total was 10 and 1/2 eight oz. jelly jars. I could have made more, but I decided that was enough. Maybe more tomorrow? I will make a cobbler for sure, with walnuts and raisins, from the box with the last of the apples-Thrifting Scores-I hit Goodwill on the way home today, and spotted the bird above! I love birds!!! It's perfect for winter decor, kind of French counrty and it's big! It's about 7\" high with a nice antique finish-$4.00I recently chipped my cheap, thin Ikea white platter in a few places. I kept my eye open and found this heavy, white platter-It's 14\" across by Pampered Chef, nice and heavy! I'm sure it was expensive new, and looks like it's never been used, no marks.  Perfect to replace my old one for group meals. Love it! I also had a 20% off coupon, so score!

Here's some ideas from the Redcross.org Prepare for Emergencies , but there's lots more online. I think a good strategy (sometimes) is knowing when to leave the area if you can. And buddy up with your neighbors. Here's a sample of a few things I've been doing recently-Bought some chicken quarters on sale (cheap BBQ prices) to repackage and freeze, ditto bacon in a bulk package, have been freezing fresh fruits, and bought bulk rolled oats to store in big jars-Found some great wool socks for winter at Costco, since mine are so worn out, $10.00 for four pairs-Lots of canning, see below post. Am stocking up on more 1 gallon water jugs, batteries, will buy a few more rechargeable ones for our outdoor solar lights, checking our ice melt and snow shovel from last year. More bad snow is in the long term forecast. I hope they are wrong as last year was Snowmageddon!Poor Dave shoveling, againBut very pretty!Apple Harvest- Canning Time!I'm thrilled and tired, but we're having a great Pippin apple harvest this year! After a major pruning a few years back we didn't have many apples. Sunday the tree was full and then some. I took tTues./Wed. as vacation days giving me a time buffer. I just hoped the tree would cooperate :) I just wanted to do the bulk of it with Dave home to help. Pippins are a great variety, crisp and good for baking or just eating raw. We pulled out the perfect ones and they went in the fridge in the crisper. They keep well for a few months. Lots on the tree in our front yard-Tree bent heavy with fruitDave picked the entire tree, brought them in the house/on the deck, we started washing, cleaning  and putting them in containers-Usually I do the processing by myself, but with my back standing for long periods really gets to me. It also went much faster with the two of us. I sat at the dining table cleaning and cutting, while Dave worked at the sink-Since we don't spray our trees, they're wormy, so we cut the bad spots out. We may try spraying with an organic spray next spring. With the canning food processor it removes the peel and seeds. You basically just 1/4 and cut off the bad spots, cook, and throw in the processor. Works great! The hens loved the leftover pulp, oh my!After I got the 1st big pot full of apples cooking Dave went out to harvest the rest. I decided to make applesauce first since it's more labor intensive and messy. I use the largest screen blade on my Roma Strainer Deluxe Sauce Maker since I like mine chunky. The first batch of apples (5 gallon pot?) yielded a about 10 Qts., and I didn't need to add any sugar they were so sweet. I did 6 more after that including 4 spiced, like apple pie filling.1st batch2nd batchLooking good!More room to go!Dave told me after weighing some that we were looking at several hundred pounds, maybe 300!I did canned apple slices today. Apples slices, so much FASTER than sauce. Just slice, toss in Fruit Fresh, make a light syrup, then process. Some of them floated even though I thought I jammed them in. Oh well. I had to stop mid-afternoon and evaluate if we would need more sugar or lids.  We had a LOT of apples! It was hard to judge given the bug spot factor. Luckily a grocery store with a good supply of canning supplies is 5 minutes from our house. I sent Dave down to get more sugar and lids. I set aside a small box of apples to apple butter Tuesday. We had just enough 1 Qt. jars! We both agreed to give away about the last 30 Lbs. of the apples on Craigslist. We know there are people that could use them for themselves if needed, or as feed. We felt good giving them away, since someone picked them up within 30 minutes of posting. We both didn't want to work til midnight, and Dave starts his new job tomorrow. We have plenty for the 2 of us, share the wealth I say. Our total was 62 Qt.s of apples products this weekend-Last batch coolingDave and our haul!HAPPY LABOR DAY!

Even with the warmer weather this week, 95 degrees today, the days are shorter. I'll be canning apples this long weekend, with more freezing and other food stashing. I had a volunteer in the garden this summer. I thought it was some kind of edible squash, but it's a ornamental pumpkin! Last year I bought a few locally, then they were composted. We tossed some compost in the garden, now we have free pumpkins! Fall is on the way :) I'm leaving on the vine until it cools a bit since they rot in the heat. I looked up the variety CuteDave got a check yesterday he didn't expect from his last job. I had had a terrible day at work, so we went out for dinner! We dad a great, relaxing chat about how the layoff went. I mentioned being happy about only having to tap a little savings. Dave said we actually never did that. While he pays the actual bills, I'm in on everything. We have a \"savings\" account, but we also have a \"slush fund\" built into our checking. It's a little random money that we let accumulate and don't have listed in our register. When Dave told me a while back he had to transfer a little $$$ I thought he meant from savings. It was actually from the slush fund. So, right now, having been unemployed for 7 weeks, we basically lost no money. Dave said we actually SAVED $1,000. Receiving various funds, cutting expenses, shopping less, and using some of our food stores did make a BIG difference! It wasn't as bad as I thought. Sometimes you just never know how it went til it's actually over.Free High Chair-We baby sit one grandchild every other Saturday and had a little booster seat for the dining table, but no tray. A few nights ago I was thinking I should check Craigslist, then I went to the free section and found this highchair! Dave's last day off work was Friday (new job starts Tuesday), so I emailed the person and he made arrangements for the pickup Friday. After basically wasting about 2 hours, since the owner kept getting \"delayed\", he finally picked it up. It's safe, Dave deep cleaned, but was missing the pad. It has 3 trays, can be put in a recline (for infants) position, has wheels, and folds up slim. New they're about $125.00 on up. I was going to try and make a pad, but realized it would be time intensive, with other looming projects. I looked on Etsy, but too much $$$, looked on eBay and found pad this for $14.00-I'll modify it since there's a little riser post in the leg area, but it was a great deal! We used it today (without the pad) for Grand baby River, and it worked great! Much less mess and easy to clean and store away. When we're done using it we can sell and get our $$$ back. SCORE!!! Fermented Curtido Success-I recently posted about the messy start of my Curtido making- and then fermenting for 2 weeksNow it's done! We had a dinner of chicken flautas and the curtido. It spicy, full of flavor, crunchy and full of yummy probiotics! The whole batch in the fermenting jar worked out to be 3 1-Qt. canning jars. They're now resting in the fridge, minus what we had for dinner.It's amazing what you can do with a little salt and veggies! My fermenting jar is now ready for another batch of something, still thinking. I seemd to keep missing the pickling cukes, but will check again..."},
{"title": "Lessons Learned From A Layoff, Thrifting Scores, Cooking Sweet Italian Peppers", "date": "Aug 27, 2017", "text": "Lessons Learned From A Layoff-For a variety of reasons I decided to not to post this until after it was over. Those reasons are personal. Primarily I think it's important to retain a positive focus during tough times. I also asked Dave if he was comfortable with my posting this in the interest of possibly helping other people and he agreed. He's that kind of guy! My husband Dave was lad off his job at the end of a day on a Monday in July. He knew it might be coming, and was working for a large multinational company, so big decisions aren't made locally. It's a numbers game in his field of industrial sales. He called me at home late in the afternoon and said \"if you get a phone call in a few minutes I've been laid off and have my papers in the car.\" I was a bit surprised but not shocked, knowing that their sales and numbers were down. He did help set things up with his manger before he left, then was escorted out the door. He did find out later his management staff was very upset the next day, that was hard for them. Before he got home I was formulating some ideas.Here was the initial good news- they laid him off a Monday (instead of the Friday before) to keep benefits for the next two weeks, enabling me to get him on my insurance with no gap. He wanted to go without out, and I said over my dead body! They also gave him two weeks severance pay and cashed out his vacation/sick leave. He found out he also had several hundred $$$ in his FSA account that he didn't know he could get. He submitted some paperwork and got a check. The day he was laid off he called out retirement person Craig, who was also a former co-worker in his filed. Here's some wonderful synchronicity- when Dave called Craig, Craig was on the line with someone who was hiring in Dave's field. Craig said he'd call Dave right back, and told the other person he needed to interview Dave. He called Dave back, and seven weeks later he hired Dave! It might not have been so delayed, but they were on vacation and short staffed. That was the good news.There are variety of things that happen, even when you know things could happen, as far a layoffs. Dave thought about transferring in the Spring to another branch but was told by his manager that their sales slump would end and they'd be fine. Mistake. Listen to your gut in business. If he had transferred THEN it would have been a much easier and less painful.We crunched numbers right away, and he filed for unemployment. We looked at what we could realistically cut as far as spending. At this point we had to NOT panic, just think more logically. We knew we'd be OK until November or so, with savings. I knew we could also tap into our retirement if it was really needed, worst case. I also knew he'd find something, since he has an incredible work ethic, and is very well liked and thought of in his field.Networking is CRUCIAL, as in that initial phone call. Dave also used multiple job websites, including Linked In, to network and get the word out.Emotionally, it takes a toll. Dave went thru anger, depression, boredom and just felt like the rug have been pulled out from under him. I had to do everything I could to reassure him we'd be okay, that he'd find a job and be the cheer leader. That took somewhat of a toll on me. We bickered some and got on each others nerves, but that's understandable. I think it helps in this situation to allow small things that can comfort a person in tough times. Dave liked to go to Starbuck's once or twice and week and he'd said he'd stop. I told him to keep going. I got him out of the house, and made him feel more normal. It was worth the money. We also took a short road trip one Saturday afternoon because it was a metal health things for both of us. Not everyone would agree, but we both knew this wasn't going to last. We needed to get thru the process intact.I did set up an Etsy account during this time, which I had planned on doing. I was just more motivated. I also inventoried our foods- freezer, pantry closet, kitchen, etc. to see exactly what we had. I was happy that I had a fairly good stockpile to pull from.Dave used the time at home and was very helpful. He deep cleaned the house, preserved peaches, did yard clean up, heavy gardening, car appts, etc. That freed up some time for me on the weekends. That reduced my stress some. He froze 12 one-gallon bags of rhubarb gifted from our neighbor for instance-We talked daily about little projects he could do while I was at work. Planning a little at a time wasn't so overwhelming. He was really good about that.He's starting his new job after Labor Day, and it's a good fit. He went to Portland this weekend for a family reunion, with a ticket from last winter when his flight was cancelled due to weather. He stayed with family and it was a perfect time for him to have a break. I did things here at home. We survived and we learned some things.Chicken pitcher, $3.00Thrifting Scores!Had a really great finds at two Goodwill stores. I was needing a cardigan for upcoming fall weather at my job and found a beautiful J.Jill new sweater with the tag for $6.99, part wool and cotton, toggles down the front, a heathered cable knit, with Velveteen strap button loops, cream color. Fit perfect! Also a new cheap solar system puzzle for Grand baby for a buck-Also found a needed large wicker basket for $2.99. I went to another Goodwill today and found alike-new purple corduroy shirt jacket, $5.00. Yesterday I got a great deal at the Eddie Bauer Outlet with my $10.00 off coupon, a 40% off tee-shirt for hubby, was $2.50. Most of his tees are in bad shape, so score! A good weekend!Cooking Sweet Italian Peppers-I read about these peppers in the last year, so I decided to grow some. I ordered some seeds, but was lucky to find some starts locally. I went recipe hunting after having a nice harvest (more coming!). This recipe looks amazing, I would need to try these on a weekend when I have some time- Stuffed Italian Frying PeppersI also found some random, anecdotal stories online, with great info-They are sweet and are usually pan-fried with onions and eaten with sausage in my family. Occasionally, they are oven roasted and peeled, served with garlic, olive oil and red wine or balsamic vinegar as a side dish.Make a slit lengthwise on each pepper, heat fry pan with a splash of oil, place peppers with slit facing down and fry until peppers have a light golden color. Turn them over and stuff peppers with either feta cheese or ricotta and fry until the underside is also a light golden color.I went with simple frying- a large onion, some olive oil, salt, pepper, and a package of mild Italian sausage cut in chunks. I used about 7 peppers, split and seeded. Next time I would cook the sausage in a separate skillet as it was a bit to oily for me -I also used some of our fresh tomatoes and parsley in a different skillet saute with pasta-I used canned chicken breast for protein, tasty! Added fresh basil after I took the shot, with whole grain linguine, and crusty bread-Next weekend I will be canning tons of our fresh apples! Looking forward to that!"},

Cooler at night, days getting shorter, but the forest fire smoke has returned. Oh well, at least we had deep blue skies earlier this week! This is what I call high summer here at our little homestead- tall perennials, huge Russian sages, apple tree loaded! The basil is big and ready for pesto making to freeze. Some of this I'm trying to hold off unit Labor Day weekend, 5 days off for me! I'm taking the following Tues./Wed. off. Nice to have a longer break to work on more food preserving! Dave will be at a family re-union next weekend. It will be nice to have the weekend to myself, to work on projects and have some sushi out! Dave's not a Japanese food fan, so a friend and I are going out! I see some crafts I may do as well. I have really been enjoying reading Wendy's posts here 21 Days Until Teotwawki, Day Zero chronicling major financial changes in their family and how to cope, think outside the box. You never know when the rug will be pulled out from under you. Good to have some things already in place. Anyway, here it is for now, my ID Days. This is really one of the best things I can look at to let me know how things are going, and staying focused. Given world events I am working on storing more foods right now, etc. Nice to know I have a useful skill set.1. Plant Something-No fall planting here, but  have 2 lavenders (1/2 price) sitting on the deck. Will plant tomorrow now that it's cooled off a bit.  2. Harvest Something-I picked our 1st Lemon cuke last week, amazing! Now our Italian peppers, Gypsy peppers and tomatoes are ripening- I read a few ways to cook the Italian peppers, including grilling with a little Olive oil, or \" Luscious on an egg, pepper, and provolone sandwich made with good Italian bread!\" Oh boy!!! I'll experiment, but they're not hot, but sweet, yum.Hens are starting to lay again yay! I increased some protein snacks and it's cooling. 60 this morning and only in the 80's. Thankful for that! 3. Preserve/Store Something- Fermenting some Curtido. Still freezing blackberries, we have abut 2 Qts. Will freeze tomatoes as the ripen. They froze great last year, just wash, dry, quarter, and into a plastic container! Easy. Apples will be ready soon, hopefully for my five day weekend over Labor Day. I hope. Pears sometime after that. May make some pear butter.4. Manage Reserves- Get a GoodDeal/Barter/Stock Up/Prep-Negotiating $75.00 off a Dr. bill. Unreasonable charges, and THEY suggested. Dave got a $650.00 refund on his FSA card, unexpected! Got a nice, new-ish work blouse on Ebay, LL Bean, scored! I adore their wrinkle/stain resistant blouses. Perfect out of the dryer.5. Eat the Food- Try NewFoods/Recipe-I just saw some recipes for Chilaquiles, a Mexican dish I hadn't heard of. Two recipes here - Tillamook.com and Foodnetwork.com  These are basically eggs with a enchilada style sauce with tomato, on top of chips with cheese. The Tillamook recipe has a fun history of it. Basically day old stale chips topped with eggs, etc. This could be modified easily!  6. Build Community Food Systems-Bought some local fingerling potatoes from a small local market.  7. Recycle/Re-Use-I saw a \"free box\" after a yard sale near our house and got both of  these-Ceramic counter canister, perfect! Not sure where it will go yet, I may paint? Hmmm.Heavy plate rackPerfect for some cook books I want to see to use! 8. Skill Up-Learning some new things setting up my new Etsy shop. Looking at a craft demo to see how it sells. I think it will do really well. We'll see...9. Regenerate What is Lost/Salvage Something-Am planning on getting something to clean up my headlight covers on my car. Getting pretty hazy. Tried a DIY version, no worky. I want them BRIGHT for the shorter days coming..."},

We didn't really have enough to bother canning, since we'd frozen and used up some last week. I wanted to do something different today with some of our peaches. I saw we had some frozen blueberries, did some research and made this- Bigbearswife.com peach blueberry bread. Excellent! Moist and delish! I did add some cinnamon sugar on top before baking. It's not overly sweet, and next time I might add some chopped nuts/ brown sugar/butter crumbles on top-I also made a big blueberry peach cobbler using a modified version of this Nancy's Apple Blueberry Cobbler subbing peaches for apples-I wanted to make Fermented Curtido Salvadorian Sauerkraut for a while. It's fermented, so there's lots of probiotics, and it's spicy! I made it a few years and it's worth the prep time. Lots of slicing on my little mandolin (very sharp!). Didn't cut myself :) I got 90% of the pounded mixture into my fermenting jar, amazing! It's setup is really fool proof and safe, so it was a good investment. A cheap mandolin was great for this too, just slice carefully. For the price of two heads of cabbage, etc., you have a great side dish!I used a giant mixed bowl, and finished pounding with a french pastry roller, works great. Bought up the brine pretty quickly. Do this before you mop, it's messy!Now on the pantry rack, but covered with a towel, 10 days to go!My New Etsy Shop!I'm happy to announce I have a new Etsy shop! It's called LittlehomesteadFinds, and there's a link on the right border of this blog. I have one item for sale right now. It's an amazing African tribal basket, leather with Cowrie seashells that I've had for years-I've been downsizing lots of things over the years, and still had this. If you're interested, please let me know, might be able to give you a reader discount :) I will be adding more over time, and have a farm style organizing craft in the works. No details yet. I'm excited!"},

Two years ago we added a peach tree to our front yard, detailed here How To Add A Fruit Tree To Your Landscaping . Last year we had one peach, this year it's a BUMPER CROP!  I think the wet spring helped. I chose the Red Haven variety as it is a freestone (pit comes out easily), ripens early (since we have 2 other fruit trees) and is a thin-skinned peach. less fuzz. The last time I made anything it from local peaches was 2012 More Peach Jam . We lost our nectarine tree, and had an amazing peach tree at our last house 10+ years ago. It was a long wait but worth it! We've been eating them fresh, and I made a peach milkshake last night! OMG!!! Yummy. I used this low sugar recipe last time and it was a keeper, just buy the low sugar pectin -Easy Low Sugar Peach Jam. I do make a small part pf the batch \"spiced\", add some cinnamon and cloves. Tastes like a peach pie :) Anya said all the peach processing sounded exhausting-Then she took a nap in my enamel washbasin for picking-We realized today the squirrels were after the peaches so we picked all of them. We already froze 10 one gallon bags last week. I am taking Tuesday off work to process more, if the kids haven't picked up the rest. The rest are inside where it's safe and cooler. I want to make a peach bread too this weekend. Lots of recipe online. First I got out my jars and supplies, set up the processing areas, disinfected the sink, etc.- Cooling areaCleaned jarsWhere I will fill jars, easier to cover, then washCooking-I love the color of the jam! I made 14 1/2 pints, 2 pints, not bad for a few hours work!I made 2/3 regular and 1/3 spiced, all labeled. It's fun to hear the pinging of the lids. While some don't do this I follow the old method- put boiling jam into hot, sterilized jars, seal, turn upside down for about 15 minutes. Turn back over, put on a cooling rack. As they cool the seals ping. Easy for jams and jellies. I've never had a seal fail this way.We realized today the squirrels were after the peaches so we picked all of them.

I want to make a peach bread too this weekend. Lots of recipe online. I also need to blanch and freeze collard greens, kale and make pesto to freeze. Tuesday will be busy preserving foods! It's amazing to cut up fruit, still warm from the tree, throw it in a pot and preserve! Talk about local! It will be nice to have the apples too, when they get ripe. Pears as well. It's been a great harvest year. Tomatoes are getting there slowly, lot there but green. Peppers doing well, eating batches of green beans weekly.Love the color! Red haven indeed!My peach crisp last weekend was great!Fave Kitchen Re-Do From Design On A Dime-I recently checked out the Design On A Dime book from the library for some bedroom ideas.

Much more to come, and I will fill the freezer and can some. It's been hot and smoky, but we ventured out today! We hit two thrift stores while we were out. First I found two cute books for the grand babies-69 cents, like new!!!Each animal face has a flap that says \"goodnight\" underneathThis one from my fave author, Jan Brett-I have been looking for one of these for years!!! Just a very small wall rack for my little bathroom, to clear the counter of daily use things, like-new $3.00, fits my beachy theme-Dave mounted it on the wall with a few small nails, looks great! When I spot something vintage looking I stop and look! A little French here, translated to a grocery store list, $1.99.

I borrowed several books from my local public library, only five minutes from my house. One I checked out was Romantic Prairie Style by Fifi O'Neill, and it gave me some great ideas- While I'm not into the chandeliers, lace, etc. I've always loved old pieces. Worn by time and well-loved.

{"title": "What Can You Do???", "date": "Jul 31, 2017", "text": "What Can You Do???Leigh had a great post here that got me thinking 5acresandadream.com  Take a read! My response was this-I think this is where you need to not be a \"sheeple\" and think outside the box. We have planted 3 fruit trees and I have a great harvest coming on this year. I'll be canning and freezing veggies too. We have 3 hens for eggs. While we live on a city lot we do what we can. We barter, trade, get creative. Most of my nice clothes for work are thrifted. I buy chocolate with the difference :) I also have 2 five gallon buckets of freeze dried fruits and veggies stashed, as well as a pantry. We have salvaged wood set aside for misc. building projects we scavenged from family, headed for the trash! All kinds of free things are out there as well. We were just offered a free family portrait from my hubby's friend after he fixed a home problem for him. It pays to think ahead and be observant. What kind of opportunities can you notice???That post got me thinking more... This may not be popular, but I've never been a fan of whiners or victims. I've have survived and moved past some really awful things. Much of it was basically thru self improvement, insight and forgiveness. My childhood was something I survived and moved past. Basically it was very dysfunctional, with addiction issues, and my only sibling passed away when I was 13. I started studying philosophy probably looking for some kind of compass when I was 14. That helped me tremendously. I studied all the world religions and more. I reached a point where I chose to not be a victim of my childhood anymore. That took years. And years. There reaches a point where I think YOU HAVE TO CHOOSE TO CREATE YOUR LIFE. Whatever that is. And get on with it. It may not be easy, but the rewards are there. 20 years ago I didn't know how to- roof a house, sell a house, buy a house, build things, set up a rain barrel, clean chimneys, grow food I could store, can, dehydrate, make jams, start a pantry, make salves, grow medicinal herbs, keep chickens, blog, be a librarian, be a grandparent, I could go on. It's a process and you have to start somewhere. People who survived the Depression did so not because they didn't have anything better to do, but because they HAD to. They CHOSE to. Many threw themselves off buildings, the rest got creative and rolled up their sleeves. If you had no income tomorrow what would you do? If you lost your car/s, your house? What can you learn, how could you get creative???  So back to the title of this post....... what can you do???"},

We've been watering, weeding and just starting to harvest summer veggies! I asked Dave to trim our pear and peach tree this morning. It was that or have the branches snap off under the weight of the fruit. It was the best way to go with the space we had. Peaches are turning color, still hard, maybe 2 weeks or? I will try and take at least one day off work to process. We didn't want the each tree pushing up on the roof. Dave spotted out first tomatoes , Lemon Boy, Friday night. Just in time for dinner. We  were eating it still warm from the garden. Now that's organic! We just drizzled with some balsamic glaze ($3.00 at Trader Joe's!) and some roman cheese.Our first Italian pepper!yes, it is!Green beans are about ready, more tomatoes coming, some hot peppers, and herbs doing great too. The hen's egg production is way down, not a surprising with the heat. Here they are waiting in line for some treats, they love rolled oats! I give them cool treats in the heat, love cuke chunks as well!Gwynne on the left, Rosie in the middle, Ellie on the rightSo... it's project time! I have put this off for three weeks, so today was the day! I bought this little thrifted mirror over a year ago when I was supposed to move into a large cubicle at work. We never moved. It was pretty gaudy silver/fake bamboo frame, but nice mirror- Cubicle move didn't happen, so I stashed it and recently thought chalk paint! I had some white leftover Reclaim Beyond Paint that I did a test/review on, and my old table came out great-I also wanted to re-paint my little wood tote for papers on my desk. It was already spray painted off white, just wanted a minor refresh.Before off white wood tote I also wanted to use a printed sheep graphic that I already had, free, from this website-  TheGraphicsFairy.comAfter 1st coat chalk paintPrinted design applied with 1st coat Modge PodgeAll done!Mirror taped off, ready to paint1st coatAll done! I may move to another location...                                                       All in all time well spent, and I find these small projects pretty relaxing! :)Kickin' Collard Greens & Bacon Wrapped Chicken Breasts- Our collard greens are doing great! They love the heat and part shade of the raised bed. I didn't grow any last year, seeds never took. My last cooked batch (from 2 summer ago) was a bit bland so I found and tried this recipe Kickin'CollardGreens.  It was awesome! I think the chicken broth, garlic and red pepper flakes really helped-Collard greens cookingI was looking at the bacon that was still sitting out from the collards. I was going to cook chicken breasts for dinner that night. I thought bacon, chicken? Hmmm. I found recipe and I already had honey mustard dressing on hand. recipe here- Bacon Wrapped Chicken Breasts The thick sliced smoky bacon really made it!Ready to go in the ovenHornet's Nest-Last week our neighbor's grandchild, on a second story deck, asked Dave what the ball was growing in our tree? With the bugs going in and out? And it's getting bigger every day? Dave looked up to find a BASKETBALL sized hornet's nest, right above our desk. Oh s**t. He showed me when I got home and we both decided for safety reasons to call an exterminator. The Internet said you can leave them, but it was right over our deck and we could have all gotten stung multiple times. Since I was at work, I had asked Dave ahead of time to ask the exterminator not to douse our back year with poison. Since they do spray the nest, killing them, I didn't want any contamination if possible. He nicely covered our herb box with a dome contraption. he sprayed onto the roof, which contained things more. After seeing some couch sized nests online (I kid you not!) he said it was small. He nuked it and Dave removed it off the roof a while later. The bug guy said they wouldn't come back. $95.00 later all gone. sigh of relief. If the high winds had knocked it down it would have been a nightmare!Why I Love Costco (Mostly)-You know how sometimes you run of of certain things all at once? For me it was- shampoo, face wash, body wash (no more soap scum!), antihistamines (terrible allergy season), cat litter, and TP. Add a few other odd things, we decided it was time for Costco. I usually buy face wash and shampoo at a local drug/grocery store. We ditched bar soap after reading how it is the cause of soap scum in showers/tubs. Last winter when I had terribly dry skin I spotted two huge bottles of naturally moisturizing Kirkland Citrus Body wash for $10.00, SOLD!  Here's a little tidbit about why it's much more \"natural\" than other brands as well! Costcocouple.com  Great stuff, very mild, not too scented for me. I also found a BIG two pack of Cetaphil skin cleaner with a bonus travel size too. Again a great steal, $20.00. One for the shower, one for my little bathroom. That will probably last me thru the end of the year or more. Kirkland Allegra generic was $33.00, for 180 tablets. I have been paying $15.00 for 20 tablets I think. Do the math. Costco is .18 cents per pill, pharmacy was .75 cents. That a about a 75% savings. I probably won't use it up this year, since I'm only taking it while the pollen count is so high. I got a monster sized chunk of Asiago cheese, $7.00. The rest I won't bore you with. On the MOSTLY comment- not everything in Costco is a good deal. One shampoo was about the same size that I usually I get, same price. Some foods there are not a great deal. Steer clear of the junk food too. Way to easy to eat too much since it's so CHEAP. I looked at their luscious peach pie, $15.00! Separate from the fact my peaches are almost ripe (2 weeks?) $15.00 for a pie? Really??? I mean it's good sized, but.... I did get 2 big loafs of their rustic french bread for $6.00 fresh out of the oven-So, in general buyer beware, crunch some #'s, do the math and shop wisely! And skip the samples, your waist will thank us!"},

Master Bedroom Potential Wall Color", "date": "Jul 8, 2017", "text": "After shotDIY Cheap Wheelbarrow Rehab-It is HOT. 103 yesterday, 102 right now at 6:00 p.m. We're been watering a lot, but we always mulch everything well. Dave just planted 2 more tomatoes and 1 pepper, and spread more manure. The hot weather veggies are doing great, with tons of berries this year! The Blackberries, Marion berries and Raspberries are LOADED. We're going to pick/bag/freeze as they ripen so I can make some pies, jams, etc. It's easy to eat a few here and there, then they're all gone. With the heat we are thankful we have good A/C in the house and cars. We use ceiling fans a lot, have insulated curtains, and dress for the weather. I'm keeping the chickens cool as well. So here's how we....We've had this wheelbarrow so long I'm not quite sure how old it is? Dave said about 22 years? It had some rust but mostly needed a rehab to preserve it longer. Here's a DIY guide to doing this yourself! Our cost was about $15.00 for paint and replacement nuts/bolts. The color for the paint that I suggested was green, instead of the old blue- Before picture, Dave did this while I was at work so I couldn't get a shot of the inside, mostly just beat up, scratched, etc. The wood handles were in really bad shape, dried out and varnish worn off. First get out the tools you'll need, mostly a screwdriver and crescent wrench. Take it all apart. About 1/2 of the nuts and bolts shattered when Dave did this, pretty rusty-Set aside to count later and replace with new-From a big box storeDave bought black Rustoleum paint for the handles and braces, used a canvas tarp. Wire brush and lightly sand the bad spots. Make sure you get all the angles, and he did 3 coats on the handles- 2 coats of paint later! All green :)Tires still fine!Underside back togetherI think we're good for another 22 years! You can buy new handles, which we tried to do, but couldn't find the right size. Thrifting Scores!!!Speaking of saving money... I hit Goodwill today running some errands. Boy did I score! Here's the haul (except the baby clothes and a blouse) all for a little more than $20.00 bucks-Still had the new tags on it, about 8\" wide, $2.00French Country HEAVY ceramic bread box, $4.00!LidNew home :)Whale Welcome sign, I fixed the broken stringI really miss the ocean after moving to Boise, so I put out beach things in the summer. Brings back memories! We're hoping to go to Portland and maybe the coast, but we have to see how it goes...Love the twigs and small boards!Deep Oak frame, glass on 2 sides with beach items, you can rotate for a different look!Stainless steel lined, new, had a small dent on the cupI bought 4 baby shirts, a pair of baby short, and a work blouse for me. What a score!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Master Bedroom Potential Wall Color-I am planning on painting our master bedroom this next Labor Day week, since I have the week off. Dave showed me how to Photo Shop the potential wall color, a light gray. While it's a little darker/green than I want, it's close, and I'm a visual person-It gives me an idea to work off of. We really love the white/gray color in our master bath-I may use the exact same color, but I will get paint chips when it's closer. Dave has adamantly vetoed painting the bedroom set. So it's wall paint, maybe rotate/ relocate some bedroom art, etc. What do you think??? I can live with the furniture, just wanting something lighter."},

{"title": "Independence Days Challenge, Summer Decor, Master Bedroom Re-Do Ideas", "date": "Jul 2, 2017", "text": "Independence Days Challenge-It's getting to be another hot summer right now, triple digits for the 4th! We may stay in, as frying outside by the water doesn't sound that appealing. Maybe in the water all day, but otherwise, I'll pass. I love swimming, but 100 degrees is no fun, unless you're in the water all the time. We may go to a movie and have a little family dinner here. Right now we're watering a lot and keeping an eye on the yardens. With the 4th around the corner, I thought I'd visit this challenge again! Here goes....1. Plant Something-We just bought three more 1-gallon veggies, 1/2 price to add to the garden. 2 tomatoes and 1 small red bell pepper. $3.00 each, and fruit set already. I love buying these this time of year-  2. Harvest Something-Lots of eggs! Chives, herbs, collard greens are ready, kale just about. Lots of peppers on the plants. Tons of fruit on the pear, apple and peach tree. Peaches should be ready in July, as I bought an early ripening variety. My roses are just exploding, I'm going to cut and bring some in out of the heat- 3. Preserve/Store Something-I have been hitting the local Grocery outlet, buying breads, frozen foods, amazing European jams cheap. I'm a sucker for their Danish jams, big chunks of fruit, very clean. 4. Manage Reserves- Get a GoodDeal/Barter/Stock Up/Prep-Went to Costco yesterday, got great deals on Tabasco (huge bottle for $5.00), cat litter, much-needed windshield wipers. I've been keeping an eye on the pantry closet more. I need to do some deep sorting their. Bought some great used books on Amazon, more below.5. Eat the Food- Try NewFoods/Recipe-I heard about Rachel Khoo quite a while back. I got a great deal for three of her (used) books on Amazon. My summer reading pile may be different than some, but some amazing, simple recipes - She was British and moved to Paris, studied French pastry at a chef's school, eventually had a BBC cooking show filmed in her tiny studio apartment kitchen. I found her Chicken Crouton Salad recipe 1st, using the chicken breast skins as croutons, then sliced breast meat, an iceberg lettuce wedge, with a buttermilk dressing. BRILLIANT!!!I used my bowl of Service Berries from last weekend to make a compote to go with berry pancakes! I used the whole grain Kodiak mix, added cinnamon and a little sugar-Compote with berries, sugar, a pinch salt, a little corn starch and waterAbout done!Served with bacon, wonderful flavor! Similar to blueberries, but unique6. Build Community Food Systems-Sharing extra eggs with our girls, will hit a framer's market this summer, maybe. They tend to be either over-priced or lacking what I want.7. Recycle/Re-Use-I've been cleaning out more closets. I made a management decision (ha) that I will get rid of any summer work blouses I have to iron. What waste my time ironing? So I'll be donating those nice clothes. Time freed up for me. I loaded up my upcycled painted book tote for the grand kids-8. Skill Up-French cooking, for now.9. Regenerate What is Lost/Salvage Something-I have been doing a lot of mending on my clothing. Hemming repairs, reattaching buttons. It always amazes me that people throw away something missing a button! Summer Decor-In the front yard I put out some mini flags, and wind spinners for the 4th. Inside I mixed summer decor with patriotic goodies. Here's a peek-I wanted to brighten up the couch, then had a brilliant idea to drape my Grandma's quilt over it! It's Anya approved!Beachy tableAll thrifted itemsMy fave chunky prim handmade flagEntryway dressed up for summerMaster Bedroom Re-Do Ideas-I painted our master bedroom a nice peach when we first moved in. Something soothing. Now I want something brighter. I have about nine days off around Labor Day, so I'm planning on painting it. Here's the old paint color above. I'm shooting for a very white gray, like our master bath. It's really grown on me. I started a big Pinterest folder if you want to see some ideas I have?  I thought about doing a board /batten wall behind the headboard, but it wouldn't go with the furniture. I may do that later, if we get new bedroom furniture. I was hoping to get some from Ikea, but I can do much better carefully thrifting. We got a bedroom set years ago from Pier One, but I'm ready for something different. With the rattan I can't really paint it and I'm keeping the wall art over the bed. I'm inspired by these kinds of this looks- light walls, light or natural woods, simple and clean.

It's been warming up gradually since then. Going into the 70's now, with 90's forecast for next week. I wound up being offered a \"vacation\" day today, due to lower work load. Since I had tons of little projects I jumped at the chance. Sometimes it seems like all those little things can add up being very time-consuming. So today was project day! I did sleep in, so I can't complain too much. And got lunch out at Sonic, love their Chicago dogs!On the list of things to do today- Called my FSA (health savings account) card company for 30 minutes. I had to clarify why I keep getting emails over and over for the sme claim. Fixed :)I finally found some small river-stone type rocks buried in my craft cart to finish off my lucky bamboo. I had moved it to a bigger pot-  I washed our living room chair slip covers, pretty dirty around the edges. All clean and purty now-Re-painted my $4.00 thrifted magazine rack for the Grand kid's books. It was a free re-do, I just used spray paint I already had.

It took a real beating for 10 years outside, then we had really heavy snow this winter. It's been the cursed chicken trying to paint it! Every time I was ready to paint it rained! I won't match things exactly, but that's OK. It was another no-cost rehab, just used the paints I had on hand. I will give it a coat of polyurethane at the end for extra weather durability. I will use a foam stamp for the edging. I can't free hand that kind of thing! I used Dave's new nail gun to attach the one wing and strengthen the other. Maybe it will go for another 10 years! Rain was approaching this afternoon again, so fingers were crossed. A light breeze helped the drying time. I still need to finish painting tomorrow, just too humid today. I thought I'd gt all the painting done today, but Mother Nature didn't cooperate. Ah well!Sign after sanding-Cedar under thereI hung it on our bird feeder so I could paint all sides at once- First coatI will do another coat tomorrow, since it's so humid, and sprinkling. I will re-do the welcome letter and add some edging. I found another fun chicken (spoon rest) yesterday-$4.00 at Big LotsI posted a few things on Craigslist for sale today. We've sold some biking gear in the last 2 weeks, and extra $60.00 for us! I'll be ironing summer work clothes tonight, boring but it takes time too.I'll be taking down the Spring decor tomorrow and putting up some summery stuff!

Being too tired to type the recipe out, here's the recipes in two photos. The Tabasco sauce really makes it!Serve with chips and veggies and it's a meal.

It's 52 and POURING right now at 9:00 p.m. So much for summer weather. Luckily it will warm up late this week. I'm taking Friday off and looking forward to doing some painting projects outdoors (more later). We built our backyard Trex deck abut 10 years ago. I highly recommend that material, very low maintenance! It was getting pretty dirty. We pressure washed it about 3 years or so ago. Dave borrowed two washers from friends, but they wouldn't work, so he rented one. $60.00 later it looks like new! Dirty on the rightHe also pressure-washed a few other things at the same time. $ well spent! As for planting I still had empty pots to fill-I had a $10.00 off coupon at a local nursery, so we bought a couple more tomatoes, replacement lemon cukes (chickens ate them!), more basil and some annuals-Dave and I got everything planted before the mid-afternoon rain storm-More cukes, added more protective fencing this time2 more Roma tomatoes, ready for cagesNext year I plan on setting up our mini-outdoor greenhouse indoors, with grow lights. We can start seeds, earlier, with stable indoor temps and save $$$. This spring was too crazy. Time to adapt!Yesterday I thawed the last of last summer's tomatoes (that's only 1/2 in the pic) and made a tasty pasta sauce! Looking forward to some fresh ones soon! I added some Italian sausage and cooked it down for dinner last night with whole grain linguine. To go with it I made a wedge salad with Trader's Joe's balsamic glaze, blue cheese and red onion-I also made a triple berry cobbler to have some fruity dessert-With Trader Joe's amazing custard vanilla ice cream, oh the goodnessNeighbor kitty Poesy came for a visit, and a drink-We have tons and tons of baby peaches on our front tree and Dave and I had to think them. Some of the branches are the size of chopsticks, and the branches were bending already. Still mote to come, but sad to do. Gotta protect the tree long term though. We have a ton of apples as well. I think I may have a major canning project this year, which is great! Pear tree and berries are loaded as well. I think they liked the wet spring.Little River manGrand Baby's 1st Birthday-Last Saturday we celebrated our first Grand baby's birthday, how exciting!

I decided to call them since I had never started the sweet Italian Melrose/Marconi pepper seeds. I thought they might possibly have some. It turned out they had some Giant Marconi in stock, so I bought a couple! I will save my seeds for next year-From TheDailysouth.Southernliving.com GIANT!!!I also found some heirloom sweet Italian Nardello peppers, so bought a couple of those-From GoogleI bought 2 heirloom hot peppers, a variety called Bulgarian Carrot. I wanted something fruity but not as hot as a Habanero, and the nursery recommended these-Photo Source Google, talk about carrot colored! I was thrilled to receive two $20.00 gifts cards from my two kiddos for Mom's Day, since they know I LOVE to garden. The $40.00 paid for most of our veggie and herb plants today. Sadly our last soaker hose bit the dust so we had to buy a new one. It's a good investment since we had a better harvest with less water use. Today at Home Depot I found the same Giant Marconi Pepper that I found at the local (expensive) nursery. Much bigger plants so I bought one. It's great to see Home Depot, etc. carrying more heirloom varieties. I guess they figured they were losing business not carrying them? Or maybe it's customer requests? While they still sell a lot of GMO varieties, at least they're offering more non-GMO. It's about time! I bought mostly heirloom tomatoes today- Lemon Boy, yellow cherry tomatoes, Mr. Stripey and some medium Jet Star low acid ones. We also bought a jalapeno, and we planted organic Blue Lake beans in our bean row. Busy day, but we got everything planted. Next year I am hoping to set up our mini greenhouse indoors with lights, since the springs have been so crazy weather-wise.  New pepper areaMore peppers! Lemon cukes and more peppersLate day row of tomatoes and Marion berry blossomsMore berries!The chickens had a nice free range time this afternoon. The neighbors behind us now have 3 ducks. Hopefully they know what they're doing. It was pretty funny when I noticed the ducks were peaking thru their enclosure on the other side of our fence- See the eye?  :)At the end of a big gardening day what did we have for dinner? My roast beef from the freezer with veggies, in the crock pot and amzing. With red wine too! Super tender but not mushy-Anya checking out the great buy!Thrifting Scores!Yesterday I stopped by a thrift store while I was running errands. I found 2 matching, folding kids patio chairs, only $3.00 each! Great for the growing grand children. I also found a watermelon slice $1.99 for summer decor-$1.00 faux flowers for a project A .99 cent whiteboard with magnets to add to a \"busy board\" for grand kids-A $4.00 magazine rack I will use for storing Grand kids books, I may paint, haven't decided yet-A  $3.00 tall, galvanized 4th of July candle holder at Target-I also went to the Eddie Bauer Outlet with a $10.00 loyalty card. I found an $85.00 pair of dress work slacks marked down to $14.99, with my $10.00, a mere $5.00!!! Well made and gorgeous. Happy day to score!!!"},

It had some really gaudy gold buttons that I replaced with white. Free since I always have extra buttons! Much better. I found two thick cotton 6-packs of kitchen wash cloths for $3.00 each also at Ross. Mine were toast, and you can never have too many-My favorite kitchen cloths are Ikea's spongy wash cloths, but I don't know when we will be there again I bought these.

It was 75 today, and going into the 80's mid week. More mild temps after that. Some, like the peppers will go into pots. The rest in various areas of the yard. I had never heard of the Purple Gleam poppies, pretty! I'm looking forward to trying the 2 varieties of sweet Italian peppers! We were going to try and plant our veggie starts this weekend, but it was too busy. I will spend my gift cards and use that to buy most of our veggies for this coming 3 day weekend. We decided it made more sense to have 3 days to tackle that. Tomatoes, cukes, squashes, peppers, etc. Dave spent almost the entire day today at our daughter's house. They spread bark dust, added a soaker hose, shrubs and flowers in a formerly dead parking strip. It's pretty now and will add some shade and pollinators. With the 2 girls being new homeowners (and having babies) we offered our help to get their gardens going. It's a lot of work!

I'm glad I have held off. I'm wondering what our growing seasons are doing, with wild weather swings and monster severe weather? We used to have frost in Oct., then it was early Nov. This last winter we had record snow and now a very unstable spring. I'm just wondering what the rest of this year holds? We've been doing various projects in the gardens, but no summer veggies yet.

I bought 2 packs for $3.00 total-I did a search for a recipe, similar to my own, and used this- Fresh Chili Rellenos Casserole I microwaved mine for 3 minutes instead of boiling. Next time would do 5 or so. I used Jack cheese, spicy Jack and Feta. Yummy! Served with a little salsa and chips.

I'm trying to think of what to plant now that's a not a big tree? Maybe a large shrub, like a vine Maple. I am doing do some research now on what might be a smaller tree to plant. Maybe a small Oak tree? I could use this 5 Ways To Eat Acorns if I do! I also like the American Mountain Ash tree, very pretty-From Online Tree FarmCarpeting Cleaning Choices?We had new carpeting installed in our 3 bedrooms about 7 years ago. While we wanted to do hardwood thru the entire house we couldn't afford it. We tore up all the old the household carpeting ourselves, and had the the bedrooms re-carpeted. We did a nice sage green. The living room and halls Dave and I re-floored with a nice Costco wood-look laminate. It still looks pretty good! We had our carpet shampooed about 18 months ago by a company that did a damp clean with soap, pads, and was a coupon deal. Looked good, at first. Later dirty track marks showed from the left over soapy reside :( Needing to be more deep cleaned this time I went online and checked Consumer Reports. You can join online for $5.00 per month, a great deal for a quick research project! I quickly rules out a rented machine, to much soap and wettness. For a deep cleaning we decided to go with Stanley Steamer after looking at CS. I like the no-chemical route, and it sucks up the leftover soap. Having asthma and allergies, removing dust mites, etc. is awesome!I also had them do our 4-year old area rug in the living room (from Ross), now it looks like new. It is rubber backed, but was too big for a commercial laundry mat. $ well spent,after 4 years of spot cleaning. We did the 3 bedrooms for $99.00 and $35.00 for the area rug (Boise prices). I could have used a $20.00 off coupon but I accidentally deleted the email. We're good for a few years now.  Super clean!AfterGarage Cleanup-Last weekend Dave and I both took a vacation day for a 3 day weekend. I started a new job inside my hospital organization (excellent transfer!) and we wanted to wrap some things up. On the top of the list was cleaning the garage area below-Before, what a mess!Too many garden things (destined for a new shed this fall) and misc stuff stored. It was organized at one point. We started sorting first, using sawhorses for the small things-We had- trash, donations, small amount of hazardous waste for the local pickup area, a bike \"trunk bag\" selling on Craigslist, and the rest to keep. We decided to build a new shed this fall. We'll use as much recycled materials as possible (as usual). We tore down the old one, as it was too small and narrow. The garden items will live out there.  In the \"after\" picture you can see the empty shelves! We also cleaned a smaller area where we store our paints for the house. I pitched a few things and organized the rest. We now have some empty space!"},

Garden Fundraiser Jewelry, Repair Cafes, The Creepy Side of Technology", "date": "Apr 15, 2017", "text": "Snow???I always think of April as being one of the most unstable months weather-wise. We have gone from 70 this week to snowing yesterday! It was cold, snowing and blowing. I ran an errand with my parka on in the morning about 9:30. Before I headed home I stopped and got some Starbuck's to take home. Snow was blowing in the car! By 2:00 p.m. the sun was out, with gorgeous blue skies. Today was chilly but sunny, 65 forecast for tomorrow. Crazy! At least everything is green and gorgeous!Yesterday about 11:00 a.m.Garden Fundraiser Jewelry-I was checking out Mary's Heirloom Seeds for some pepper seeds and saw this Garden Fundraiser I was curious and read a bit more. I TOTALLY support having school gardens. They're a great way for kids to learn about gardening, where food comes from and more. Info here Marysheirloomseeds.com Why Are We Fundraising?  I ordered the Ladybug necklace above ($12.00) and it is so cute! Great piece, good cause, check it out!Repair Cafes-I had heard of these before, but didn't remember what they were called. I saw this on the national news a few nights ago, what a great piece!!!There's lots of great ideas out there and here's a few websites- Repaircafe.org and Resilience.orgThe Creepy Side of Technology-This can be filed under the \"creepy side of Technology\". Hubby and I were having dinner out last night in a small little diner and there was a really pretty young woman standing over by the window waiting for her to-go order. She was really busy texting while she was waiting and I noticed a nice looking man across the restaurant from her also texting. They were only about 15 feet apart since the place is very narrow. I noticed at one point he appeared to have taken a surreptitious cellphone photo of her. He barely tilted his text phone to snap a photo and he did this two more times, with him texting right afterwards. At that point it was apparent to me he was taking her photo without her knowledge. I decided to quietly go over to her and let her know what was happening and her response was \"that's very creepy\", I agreed. I suggested that she move over to a different part of the restaurant. I didn't make eye contact with him and she totally ignored him. She left very quickly when she got her order. It was a really good reminder that you need to pay attention to your surroundings when you are out and about. The funny thing about it was the man who was taking the photos was pretty oblivious to the fact that someone else might be watching HIM, ha! While it's not against the law to take photos of someone out in public it certainly makes you wonder what he was going to DO with the photos? Post them online with some gross, disgusting comments, or?"},
{"title": "DIY Shelf with Hooks Progress, Homemade Beignets, Slow Decorating, Simple Tin Planter", "date": "Apr 9, 2017", "text": "DIY Shelf with Hooks Progress-Dave spent some time last weekend building our new DIY shelf with hooks! He loved his new battery-powered nail gun, perfect for these kinds of projects. The unit has been sanded and puttied. Dave added the holes before painting. He also hid the screws for the wall under the hook brackets. Clever idea! If there's a small mistake you can fill the holes if you do it before painting. I've never liked painting then drilling anyway. I like to paint, then be done.  He used a 1\" x 6\" and a 1\" x 8\" poplar board, and crown molding. Unlike the design that inspired me we didn't add the 1/2 round on the top shelf on the front edge-My inspirationWe did the width to match our mirror hanging above it (last weeks post). I chose three matte nickle heavy duty coat/hat hooks. I found Liberty brand at Home Depot, the \"value pack\" was $8.99 for three. I bought a fresh can of Rustomleum white satin spray paint. I'm shooting for painting outside next weekend, too cold today (low 50's). Dave thinks the whole project was about $25.00 using all new wood. It will be a good use of our space.Outside work area last weekend, with thrifted table sawClose up of hooksSide viewMy next request is for Dave was to build these floating shelves into our main back hall corner, another good use of space- DIY directions from 4men1lady.com And spring has certainly sprung!LilacsThe fruit trees are loaded with blossoms, hoping for some great canning and eating this year!Homemade Beignets-I finally got around to making some Cafe Du Monde mix Beignets last weekend. The dough is super sticky-It was hard to get the squares into the hot oil in a square. They were very light and fluffy, great texture!!! Next time I will put them on wax paper before transferring to the hot oil. I also read you can just do them as balls. Tasty either way!Mix from Cost PlusSlow Decorating-I stumbled on a few posts about slow decorating the other day-  GeoffreyandGrace.com  and Theinspiredroom.net.  I got the basic premise, buy/make things slowly that you love. Take your time, be thoughtful. I've always been a big proponent of negative space as well. Give your eyes something empty to rest on. I appreciate this more as I'm older. When I see a post of a room filled with every square inch of too much stuff it gives me claustrophobia!  Anyway interesting trend and a good one I think. My shelf above is a good example, things collected slowly over time.Simple Tin Planter-I've always loved Katie Brown's shows! She's been on PBS and network channels as well over the years. I stumbled on her episode last night with this project- Katiebrown.com  Perfect timing, right before planting season. Personally I would skip the tacks and use construction adhesive, liquid nails, etc., but that's me. They will rust over time and look very rustic, great idea!"},

The local rivers has been rising steadily the last month. Thursday we had nearly 2\" of rain in one day!!! It was mixed with snow, about 36 degrees. I had to get out my parka (and umbrella) for my work commute. That's a lot of water, which had to go somewhere. The Boise River is the main river in town. It is running at a near record high. We are fine in the part town we're in, but others aren't so lucky. Home owners near the river are shoring up their banks and the City/County is keeping a good eye on things. Salmon at a local hatchery had to be re-located as their facility may flood-Seattletimes.com I've seen lots of temporary \"ponds\" across town full of ducks and geese. Atleast they're enjoying it! The sun came out yesterday, around 55 and gorgeous clear blue skies. And new snow in the foothills. Today is partly cloudy and about 55, still cool. I'm very grateful that this hasn't really affected us. I watch the river rise daily as I drive to and from work. The irrigation ditches here are opening soon, so that should help the water level. Everything is certainly green, and tree/shrubs are budding. We just need things to dry out. Luckily it supposed to be pushing 70 degrees next week, but that may cause more flooding, sigh...DIY Wall Shelf with Hooks-Our front entryway is a high traffic area. A few years back I added a set of country wood hooks (thrifted) and a small shelf (also thrifted) under my favorite Pier One mirror-I wanted something to hang my purse, winter work tote bag, hats and other things on. The shelf is for something seasonal-It has worked pretty well. Now the hooks are sagging, shelf is getting loose and we need up upgrade. Dave has his new/used table saw, and is buying a mini-nail gun. I looked a lot for something online we could build and found this- Twopurplecouches.com (see photo at top). I loved the nice molding and silver nickel hooks. Dave will build it about the same width as the mirror. It will be sturdier and pretty simple. I will go for white paint as well. Looking forward to getting it completed soon! Dave is out shopping for lumber. It won't cost much, but we decided to go with new wood. I may turn the hooks into a herb drying rack somewhere, we'll see...  Stay tuned!!! See part 2 here- DIY Shelf Progress, then finished item here DIY Wall Shelf"},

Time to ditch the flannel sheets, move the heavy winter clothes out of the closet, and more mild clothing in. There's always debris from all the winter storms, dead branches, etc. We had some damage from the heavy snow, but I don't see any big losses. I'm getting over a bronchitis bug, that I was able to manage reasonably well. Only 9 days from onset and about done! I did lots of essential oils, homeopathic cough stuff, etc. Dave started on the yard work yesterday, mowing and getting debris out in the front. I've had to force myself to say inside and do other things, but I did pull a few weeds for the hens! My cough is almost gone, but my stamina isn't quite 100% yet.  Dave trimmed the berries for me today and did some pruning in the backyard. The berries above look much better! My poor chicken sign took a major hit, and the resin disc on the right-I will bring it in, reassemble, repair and repaint. Glue the disc back together. Lots of perennials are coming up, looking good-Frugal Beef Roast-On a certain level I've never been a big fan of crock pot cooking for big cuts of meat. Sometimes things look mushy or don't have good color. No baby food looking meat for me, with added canned stuff and high salt. This is my second bottom beef roast for $10.00 on sale! I thawed it for this weekend. I liked the idea of searing the meat in the skillet FIRST. I did that on my last Italian style beef roast and it worked great! I tried this recipe today- Slow Cooker Roast Beef W/Red Wine Sauce  Ditto the browning first-Then in the crock pot with the liquids. I used a dry Chianti we had. I did add a little Worcestershire sauce for extra flavor.In the poolAlmost done! I added some Yukon Gold potatoes in the last hour. I sauteed about 3 cups of fresh mushrooms with a little butter and flour. I added that to the pot once the meat was done. I did not remove the veggies per the recipe. We ate all that healthy goodness! Reruns will include French dip sandwiches later in the week, yum! For the $10.00 beef I basically just bought beef broth, a baguette and cheese. Lots of food there! The house smells great too. Perfect dinner on a cooler, sprinkly/rainy day like this afternoon.Bye, Bye Homegrown Apples!I was down to my last three jars of home canned apples slices from 2015. SAD. What to do? A cobbler with apples and blueberries! I have made this several times and is a great go-to recipe. From TheCupboard.net  Love it!Double batch!My pantry rack is basically pretty empty this year. I'm hoping for a good apple harvest this year. Maybe some peaches to can as well?

The bunny with the gold inner ears is about identical to my thrifted, chalk-painted one from last year-I like my ears plain thank you!My Mama Pea Giveaway Quilt Win!Spring Has Sprung Indoors-It has been very mild this last week, pushing 70 degrees! Dave trimmed back our ornamental grasses since things are sprouting up. Chickens are loving the weather! It's been raining off and on the last few days, brings lots of worms up. Dave deep cleaned the coop today, and back filled with some soil to level off the bottom. We thought about putting in a wood floor, but in this climate the heavy clay soil works fine. The girls can dust bathe in even the snowiest of weather. We put about 5\" of pine shavings on top, the \"deep litter\" method. Shavings were recycled into the garden. After Dave dug up the dirt the hens were in hog heaven out in the garden. Freshly turned soil!!!While things are greening up outdoors, it was time to put away my St. Patrick's day decor. I brought out some of my Spring things, not time for Easter yet...My mini greenhouse with the flower pot/bird and driftwood on our coffee tablefrom Epicurious.comSmothered Pork Chops with Mushrooms-We had pork chops for dinner tonite, with asparagus and buttermilk biscuits.

Score!Upcycled Dough BowI saw this bowl/candle holder at Goodwill for $3.99. When I spotted it what I saw was a dough bowl. It just needed some deconstructing. It is a heavy resin, whitewashed wood look. I tried to remove the screws at the base of the candle holders. No luck. I thought to look underneath the fabric on the bottom- Nuts!I removed the fabric and both the nuts with a small wench. Now it's ready to fill with some natural elements or vintage goodies, and the 2 holes won't show. So for $3.99 I'm happy. Someday I may get an expensive, wood vintage one, but this will do for now.Farm-Style Pie Sign-I had seen this farm-style sign all over the internet and Pinterest for a few years. I could never find one in the Cost Plus stores sadly. I wouldn't pay a lot of shipping for a $15.00 item, so I gave up. I went there to buy some teas today while I was in the area. They have a awesome collection of Twining's teas and great prices. While I was looking for something else I spotted the sign at their store! I couldn't believe it! I need to decide where to put it in the kitchen or dining area. I love the simple lettering and shabby, distressed edges-I also found some more Slap Ya Mama Cajun sauce from my post 2 weeks ago, 1/2 price! I bought 4 jars., and 2 boxes of their Cajun rice/beans mix. Checking out the clerk asked me if I had a coupon and I said no. She said \"I have one\" and gave me 30% off everything!

So here's the most recent I can think of...1. Plant Something-Wrong time of year for us, not quite spring. Starting to look for some seeds for summer! I read about Melrose Peppers used in Italian cooking, sounds like time to try those-From Rareseeds.com 2. Harvest Something-Just eggs, but at least they're laying pretty well thru the winter. The hens are happy now that the snow is all gone, and the garden has dried out.3. Preserve/Store Something-Nothing right now. I need to make some fermented cabbage soon.4. Manage Reserves- Get a GoodDeal/Barter/Stock Up/Prep-I bought a beef roast,1/2 off last week. I went back the next day and bought two more. They're in the freezer waiting for another roasting. Bought some used items on eBay. I had maxed out my out-of-pocket on my medical this year, so I got a generic Epi-type pen since it was free. :) Saved my $100's of dollars on the co-pay by getting before my deductible rolled over. Dave got a $25.00 big box gift card from our neighbor, for shoveling ALL of her snow. She'd had shoulder surgery. Getting some free home items today, furnace filter, etc.5. Eat the Food- Try NewFoods/Recipe-I made this last week, Chicago-Style Italian Chicago beef sandwiches- The roast lasted for several more sandwich dinners. I used the last of the roast last night with roasted potatoes and carrots. Yummy. At Cost Plus World Market I bought some SlapYaMama Etouffee Sauce for a belated Mardis Gras. I used it with shrimp for tonight's dinner, the sauce was spicy with a nice smoky flavor-Served with french breadI also bought Cafe Du Monde Beignet Mix as well as Cafe Du Monde Coffee and Chicory-I'm not a fan of coffeee but bought it on a whim. It's decaf, Dave likes it and it's not nearly as bitter as regular coffee! I may start drinking it too. I'll try frying up some homemade beignets (square donuts basically) and them try for a snack. It's a nice mix with very simple ingredients. I've REALLY enjoyed the series A Chef's Life on PBS with Chef Vivian Howard and want to try some of her recipes Achefslifeseries.com, Recipes I want to try her Sausage Stewed Cabbage next. I love her think-outside-the-box mentality and humility. What a great woman!!!6. Build Community Food Systems-Doing 1/2 day babysitting for our one grandchild on Saturdays, so we may have Mom and Dad help us put it our garden this summer. Or share some harvest :)7. Recycle/Re-Use-Bought used items on eBay, and I'm still cleaning out closets. Buying more thrifted clothing for the grand babies, they grow so fast! I'm watching a few more things on eBay.8. Skill Up-More baby re-orienting, things have changed. Who knew the womb was so loud! Babies can sleep thru loud activities now, like vacuuming.9. Regenerate What is Lost/SalvageSomething-I can see, after the massive snow this winter, a lot of pruning to do soon. Hopefully our garden didn't suffer to much! I think we may have lost some drubs due to the extreme cold, but time will tell. I have some nice, large Ikea bath towels that are holding up well after 2 years. The hems are coming off a bit, so I will use my sewing machine to fix those. Easy! I'm hoping a huge amount of our local small birds didn't die during the long, heavy snowstorms so I am putting out food now on a regular basis. Nice to see some of them back!"},

I had a major tummy flu bug (on top of a head cold) last Saturday thru Thursday. I stayed home Mon./Tues., mostly in bed, no appetite, chills, wiped out. I started feeling better late Tues. after I was able to eat a little. I used a homeopathic remedy from Boiron Oscillococcinum which helped quite a bit. I spent this weekend playing catch up, but am feeling good! A good day to stay inside.Pot Sticker & Roasted Red Pepper Salad-My Mom used to make this for me clear back in the 70's (dating myself!) It's an easy dish and you can jazz it up with hot pepper sauce, different veggies. I use romaine, but otherwise use this recipe- Pot Sticker & Roasted Red Pepper Salad. I made it Friday night and we inhaled it!!! Yummy...From Amazingribs.comChicago Style Italian Beef Sandwich-I had seen these sandwiches for years and decided to make some! I found an amazing deal today as well-Three pounds of top round beef, full price was $27.00, discounted $17.00, for a total of $10.00! That's a lot of meat!!! I may go back tomorrow and buy another to freeze! No waste there. Here's the basic recipe, but you can modify if needed- STLCcooks.com or for more history, go here Amazingribs.com. The great thing about this meat is you can use the leftover for all kinds of other dishes. Later this week I'm going to make beef tacos with Cojito cheese and salsa. You start with a dry rub all over-You put on a rack and put 6 cups of beef broth underneath. It smelled great! Low heat and then make the sauce/gravy and serve! I bought rolls and the mild/hot giardiniera for toppings. I'm still so happy I found such a great deal! I thought I'd have to buy a much smaller cut.Oooo, pretty! Nibbled a slice off the top :)Served with a green salad, oh my!Great Deals-After getting a little unexpected rebate I finally decided to buy a preserved boxwood wreath from Target. It's made by Smith and Hawken, an upscale garden decor compny. I have wanted one for a while. I love bringing nature in! I looked locally and the fake ones looked really cheesy. I went yesterday and they were out. I checked with Target's customer service and they were discontinued! No, say it isn't so! Having boxwoods in my backyard the wreath looks very real, since it's made from actual boxwood. I looked up making one from scratch, too complicated for me. I checked online while there and they were still available, and $3.00 off, on sale. $16.99 instead on $19.99 for a 12\". I ordered one online and with an extra President's Day discount, got it for basically the same price but delivered! While it wasn't a thrift store find, I am happy. I may add some kind of ribbon to jazz it up.I had a 15 year-old pair of Eddie Bauer work sandals that were worn out after much love and use. I like the fisherman style for work. I wanted the same basic thing, so I went to eBay. I found a close to identical pair, like new, for $10.00 and a little shipping. Happy dance!I also found a pretty floral like-new L.L. Bean blouse on eBay-I also got a close-out pair of gray cord slacks for work and a polar fleece top at Penney's too, great for our still cold weather. It's still winter here! Funny to see summer/spring clothing!And last, I did something really unusual. I paid full price for a jacket! I had two very old jackets, one thrifted. I decide to get a NEW one. I found this on L.L. Bean, and fell in love!It's soft fuzzy on the inside, nice pockets, longer in back. Love the color, heathered, \"sweater fleece\". I think I'm good for another 20 years."},
{"title": "FLOODING- The Good, The Bad & The Ugly, Navy Bean Soup With Bacon", "date": "Feb 12, 2017", "text": "Eastern IdahoFLOODING- The Good, The Bad & The Ugly-It was so beautiful...We had a record breaking, 25-year snow season, with almost 30\" of snow in Boise, in the low elevations in town. I knew things could get really ugly if it melted too fast. It did. Last week we started getting temps in the UPPER 50's! Almost 60 degrees, with rain, is unheard of in February. I sat back and held my breath. The news of flooding didn't take too long, and it hit the news hard. Eastern Idaho was hit the worst, with the rural roads, and more snow than Boise gets. Roads and hiways flooded, homeowners stranded, major property damage. We already had business roofs collapsing from the heavy snow load. It was just awful. All photo from local news sources-  Eastern Idaho hiwayRural roadIdaho Gov. \"Butch\" Otter with Oregon Governor Kate Brown toured border areasKtvb.comBoise streetOur subdivision did well with the storm drains for our street. One of the good things about modern home building is having your yard/property slope down away from your home. Water drains AWAY. We were VERY lucky to have zero flooding in our home. Dave checked the crawl space two nights ago, nice and dry. Our coop came thru fine, due to Dave's excellent design and construction. We had some minor house damage on our new siding from last year. It looked horrible a couple of days ago, but I told Dave to wait a few days for it to dry out. I was right! A little wavy spots that a few nails will fix. That was the good. Since it has cooled down quite a bit the last 2 days, 24 yesterday morning, 40 in the afternoon, it has slowed the flooding. Now it's a matter of repairs and recovery. Our Gov. declared a state of emergency, so there should be some extra funds for repairs. I'm not sure how our garden has done, but luckily the snow covered everything thru the bitter cold. Since the chickens were in the coop a lot more then usual Dave is adding some pine shavings today, to freshen things up. Deep cleaning will be next month probably. They did keep laying thru it all! Mommy's good girls. That was the good for us- no major damage, never lost power, life kept on going. I'm ready for spring, and the sun is out today again. What a relief!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Navy Bean Soup With Bacon- I found this recipe Bean with Bacon soup and decided to make it. I did, however, make it a bit healthier. I used all the ingredients BUT I eliminated the one cup of cream. I also cut the amount of bacon in half. Was great and much less fatty, better for my arteries!  I bought some pot stickers at Costco yesterday to make this old recipe- Pot Sicker and Roasted Red Pepper Salad. My Mom made this for me clear back in the 70's! Tried and true, easy as well. The sauce is key! Amazing flavors!!!"},

I found a basket in my bedroom that I emptied and re-used here-Great size, looks better already, but kind of bare. So I added something else I had-A small serving tray!Then I added a vintage jar with faux lemonsI love it! No cost, just re-purposing items I already had. Things previously in the basket will be re-homed tomorrow. The bamboo crate will go inside the cupboard.Next corner # two- desk area in kitchenMessy and not very organizedI needed to sort papers, file better, but keep short term things on the desk where I could see them. I deep cleaned, purged, refiled, shredded. I removed the candle holder from the wood tote and stored the short term papers there-It's the perfect size! Coupons on the right are in the big clip, easy to seeMuch better and again all free! I donated the other things I didn't need. I may give the white tote a fresh coat of chalk paint (leftover), and a stencil, maybe?Spring Thaw?It was a whopping 47 degrees today!!! Snow is melting, slowly, which is good. We don't need any flooding! The streets still have walls of snow along the sides. The backyard was very slippery with water on top of packed ice/snow. More warm weather on the way ths coming week. One fatality already sadly-My concrete bird in my herb boxMr. Gnome survived however!It's way too early for spring, but I can dream can't I?"},
{"title": "How I Grocery Shop", "date": "Jan 31, 2017", "text": "How I Grocery Shop-I was just reading Margo's post here How I Grocery Shop and it got me thinking. I realized I actually have developed a pretty systematic way of shopping. It's also flexible! Here's the basics of what I currently do, which has evolved over the years...When our family was younger I used to go grocery shopping with our three girls. I had a system with them, a reward when we got home IF they did a good job. Worked great! My kids NEVER thru a fit in the store, whined or begged! Dave and I always focused on good manners and work ethic. Now with just the two of us I shop primarily once a week on the weekend. I go to a low cost \"bag your own\" grocery store, with an excellent bulk section. I will point out- we don't eat meat every day, as some do. I don't buy ground meats much (never beef) for instance, except once in a while. Mostly turkey for tacos or Italian sausage for pasta sauce. I'd rather buy whole meats that are lean, with less waste. We eat a certain amount of vegetarian foods, healthier and cheaper. I always have a running list on our fridge for needed items. I go to a \"grocery outlet\" where I buy artisan breads, coffees, Keurig pods, a few organic frozen lunches and other foods about once a month. We got to Costco once a month (maybe), mostly for cat litter, supplements, and other specific items. I go to Trade Joe's once a month, again just specific items. They are all close to work or home, except Costco. I never use coupons. I just never saw huge savings, but I do buy a lot of what's marked down and I'm a good cook. I also freeze a lot of sale items. I just roasted a chicken I bought at the height of last summer's low prices. I also can/freeze our own fruits/veggies from our home garden. I just made a big pot of pasta sauce with quartered, frozen fresh tomatoes. Awesome! We're looking into buying a 1/4 of a local steer, grass fed/organic thru my hubbies co-worker. I need to have him break down the per Lb. dressed/packaged price to see if it's a good deal or not. My shopping is always flexible, since I may find a better deal on something unplanned, so I can change my menu as needed. I saw a new recipe for a Orange Mustard Pork Tenderloin I wanted to try. I bought pork chops instead, since they're much cheaper here.Costco can be a bad idea, if you don't shop smart. Many of their food items are actually higher than where I normally shop. Bigger packages aren't always the way to go! They also sell a lot of junk foods. Some items there you can really save on. Sadly they were way behind the trend of selling more whole grain, and healthy foods. I do know our medium-sized chest freezer (from Costco!) has really paid for itself the last several years. I freeze breads, meats, butter, cheese, fruits, veggies, and a few quick dinners. Something like a $5.00 frozen French Tart pizza from Trader Joe's topped with my fresh eggs and a salad is a quick, easy low-cost work night dinner. I buy my Tea's primarily at Cost Plus World Market, better deals, and a better selection. We rarely ever drink alcohol, so nothing spent there. I think a lot of people spend a HUGE amount of money on alcohol sadly. I heard on the news today that the day after the Super Bowl is being considered for a holiday?  Super Bowl Holiday? Wow. Maybe people should drink less and go to work. Unless you're travelling out of state, I don't get it, or plan ahead and take a vacation day. Weird. Anyway those are my habits that seem to work! I'm sure they will continue to evolve over time. What do you do to eat healthy and save money???"},

I bought 2 big packs of boneless chicken thighs for $12.00, about 6 lbs. or more.  I doubled the recipe, making several dinners and then some! I used a big lasagna pan. Recipe below-No time to type it out, sorryIt's simple but very tasty. You could really season it anyway you like, but I like the onion and thyme. I added baby carrots. I served with big cheesy herb biscuits and a kale salad. Yummy!Kodiak Pancakes/Syrup Review-I saw this pancake mix at Costco a while back and decided to buy some yesterday. FYI, This is not a paid for endorsement! I made some today, you can add just water, or milk, or milk/egg. Nice flavor, lots of protein, whole grains. $8.00 for a BIG box with three envelopes inside. I like pancakes once in a while but wanted more whole grains, protein, and easy to make, so this is the ticket! I first saw this brand when I bought this syrup a few months back-Best fruit syrup I've ever had hands down! I'm not a maple fan. Tons of fruits, little else, nice and \"clean\".

They should have had sand down. Anyway, it's been melting the last two days and we had 40 degrees today and a little blue sky! A tropical heatwave. Chickens have finally been able to come out and enjoy the warm temps. I saw some grass exposed when I put the hens in a few minutes ago. Grass, what's that??? We've had lots of birds out and I saw a Great Blue Heron fly over our house today too-Google photoThey're seen frequently around our rivers and water areas, so I was surprised to see one over our house. Gorgeous! Must have been a bit off course.Got My Hand Back-I finally have my left hand back, all healed up from surgery in late October. No more braces/splints, just putty for strength. My surgeon did a great job. My hand had this going on, bone on bone, ow-They removed the bottom, worn out chunk and created a \"sling\" of sutures. The tissue heals around it.

I added baby carrots the last hour.Put on the lid and walk away!I cooked mine on high for 4 hours, and it was nice and tender.

Thrifting Scores, Winter Decor", "date": "Jan 14, 2017", "text": "This weekendWhat A Difference Some Rain Makes!In the last week 2 weeks snow storm Helena blew thru dropping one foot or more of snow. We already had 10\"-12\" on the ground. It created many problems in this high desert area simply due to the sheer volume of snow. Many didn't make it to their jobs, schools were closed, accidents (many preventable), etc. The city and other businesses stepped up their game and started plowing side streets. That was a big success, however Boise's Mayor announced yesterday it was also a failure to respond more quickly. A learning lesson for various agencies. We had some rain for 2 days early this week, which helped slowly melt some of the snow. There was big fear of flooding, but luckily it stayed below freezing at night during the rain! It's just really cold again, 11 degrees last night. Foggy this morning, but the sun is coming out, and no more snow until Tues. No more huge storms heading our way hopefully. I cleared the area in front of the coop a bit more today. I re-filled the bird bath and put out a big bucket of wild bird food in the backyard. Two huge robins came out this afternoon and got a long drink. Sweet.

I found the top above (still with new tags on) and matching hat, new, nice and fuzzy. Another cute winter shirt-LOVE the details!Oliver's hat, Cookie Monster?I found a great 1 Qt. water pitcher for our dining table. Looks to be hand made in a nice glaze with blue flowers, $4.00.

Boise is considered \"high desert\" with a typical precipitation of 10\"-13\". This is the 2nd worst snowstorm in the area, only surpassed by one 40 years ago. We also had record cold last week. We received almost 2 FEET of snow in the last 3 weeks. 4\" yesterday, another 2\" today. Since it never warmed up after the initial snowfall, none of it ever melted. The side streets  became almost impassable and many started complaining VERY loudly that the County need to do something fast. They just never ave to deal with this kind of snowfall. They has already used thru their yearly budget, so the Mayor was able to get more state funding. Many local contractors donated time and equipment to start doing the side streets. Bless them! Last Thursday evening after Dave re-shoveled the driveway one of these graders came thru-Google photoThey did a GREAT job clearing the street, but pushed a bunch of snow back up in the driveway. Dave re-shoveled! Lucky for me my hubby is a workhorse!Edge of our drivewayToo much snowMy daughter with her new baby was pretty snowbound, so Dave and I went over Sat. and he shoveled while I babysat so she could clean the house. Luckily today a back how with a front loader came thru her cul de sac and got the street. The county won't do those as their trucks can't turn around. We got another 4\" yesterday when that storm hit. I felt so S-T-U-P-I-D going grocery shopping in almost blizzard conditions at 1:30 in the afternoon. Parking lot FULL, wait for shopping carts, duh. I should have gone early in the morning. Lesson learned. While I always have food/water/fuel on hand I just needed the normal fruits, veggies, stuff. There has been a major shortage of ice melt and snow shovels in town. There was a run on bottled water, batteries, propane in case people lost power. The FTE, french toast emergency :) Dave scored yesterday by finding some at a Mom and Pop gas station. Crazy what a city can run out of! As soon a stores get it in it'd gone. I spotted snow shovel in a store window out running an errand today. My daughter went in an bought it, the last one. They'd been shoveling with a regular shovel. They had people lined up at their store door when they opened when word went out they had ice melt coming in!!! We don't usually use it much but it was a matter of our being able to get out of our home. Our Subaru Outback did great, but our little Mazda M3 came thru pretty well too! Everyone on the news kept saying \"you need 4 wheel drive \" for this! NO, YOU NEED TO KNOW HOW TO DRIVE. Slow down, take your time, give your self room.   PrettyMore prettyThe coop and hens came thru really well with the heat lamp and heat disc, lots of treats and frequent checks on them. Warm and protected, but they had good ventilation. It started rain this afternoon and was up to almost 40! There's a LOT of concern over flooding, but it's supposed cool down tomorrow. School's have been closed and 2 the large ones will probably re-open tomorrow. We had 2 gorgeous sunny days last week (with bitter cold) so I am tired of the gray. Gratitude- I am so grateful we had a pretty easy go of it all in all. All of our home improvements we made since we bought the house paid off. Our newer, excellent furnace kept our house toasty in the bitter cold. Good windows, insulation and doors, ditto. A well built coop, and healthy chickens. Empress Anya our cat slept thru all of it. We had plenty of food, fuel. We had plenty of snow gear- boots, coats, gloves, hats. I didn't have to miss any work, as some did. I was able to drive the Outback to work, I swapped cars with Dave. I have a longer drive with hills. While I had some close calls with idiot drivers, luckily zero accidents on very slippery roads. Our roof came thru fine with no \"ice dams\", as the news was warning everyone about. Dave. He's such a trouper with shoveling, thankfully. Kids are all safe and sound. We never lost power, TV or computer! All in all, we did have to spend some $$$ on ice melt, but at least we found some! I made a big pot of spicy black bean soup and watched the snow fall last night. Now it's freezing rain and our driveway is a skating rink. We will survive though, life goes on! From Instagram.comWhat is Hygge???-I've had a real fondness for Scandinavian culture for a while. I love the mentality, ingenuity and hardiness of a people that can live in such a harsh area. It's also gorgeous! I also love the Swedish country look and ran across the concept/tradition of Hygge recently. It's now on the official OxfordDictionaryWord of the year 2016-shortlist I found this definition somewhere-Hygge (pronounced hue-gah) is a Danish word that is a feeling or mood that comes taking genuine pleasure in making ordinary, every day moments more meaningful, beautiful or special.I think it really speaks to appreciating life, unplugging, slowing down and staying in touch with family, friends and nature. I was doing a lot of this already! Here's a few links and there's more out on Google.

No injections, no surgery. I'm happy. Then... hand surgery- I had severe pain from my left thumb from bone rubbing on bone.

I always had to get down on my hands and knees for bake ware etc. So we emptied out all the contents, some was extra for the big pantry, some trash, some chicken treats (stale millet). We had the good sense when we had the cabinets re-faced to put in 2 corner pull out trays- Cleaned out and emptyI added bake ware, microwave containersSorting foodsFoods moved into other cabinet, with storage containersI even unearthed a 1 Qt. vintage jar with milk glass lined lid and a handle.

I looked at thrift stores, local retail stores and eBay. I went to a store to find a \"sale\" coat, and it turned out to be an online sales only, of course :( I went back to eBay and bought this L.L. Bean parka coat instead. I saved $45-$75., but it's also MUCH heavier construction. More features- pockets, flaps, lined collar, has a detachable hood, which I love!

We have a little snow in the forecast, we'll see how much we get. Coop is winterized, garden is put to bed. Dave mowed and raked Friday. I'm putting away my Autumn/Thanksgiving decor today, tossing the pumpkins. I may roast some for the hens. I washed our winter hats, gloves and added snow scrapers and a blanket to each car. We're ready! Our flannel sheets and thick quilt is on our bed, nice and cozy.We had a blast here with our family potluck for Thanksgiving. My Grandson River was here and eating his first meal in front of us! He just started on homemade, organic baby food recently and he loves it!What a big boy!Yum yum sweet potatoes!I went to Jo Ann's fabrics today to replace some buttons and found these 2 fun items, both to go over my dining table-A fun snowman, $10.00, I really like it!Snowflake, about 16\" wide, $2.00, I will paint with chalk paintI may get out a few generic winter things today if time allows.

Here's what our backyard looked like this morning-Our huge maple tree is almost bareOur cold weather gear is out, Today Dave mowed up all the leaves, put the mulch in the compost pile and flower beds, and deep cleaned the coop. Tomorrow we'll run the cord out to the coop to keep the waterer from freezing. Our freezer is full with produce from the garden harvest and our small house is warm and snug. This year I have the day before and after Thanksgiving off work to have a nice family gathering and enjoy our company.

They just moved into their first home and are nesting away. I was too busy last weekend to blog, but took some fun photos! I got the crabwiches idea from Pinterest and everyone loved them! I stuffed them with a real crab meat mixture, very tasty. We had lots of food, including shrimp, a pineapple upside down cake, and more yummy. My daughter Michelle and Angie's friend Katie helped with the living room decorating, with lots of oversized balloons, etc. I brought out my \"beach table\" things for the dining room table. I did this on a tight budget getting lots of wrappings at the dollar store. We ate, laughed, play Baby Jeopardy and opened gifts. We gifted a new white 4 In One crib and mattress for the baby. Dave had made a solid wood cradle for the girl's before they were born, and now Angie will use it for her son Oliver.

My big left wrist cast is coming off tomorrow, then a small hand/thumb splint for five weeks. My thumb is healing up nicely, from surgery. I didn't have a of of joint left for the thumb to rest on, so they removed the bone below and created a stable space for it now. Pain will be gone for good and thumb will seat correctly. Happy dance! The garden is put to bed, and leaves coming down, it's really pretty outside. Still too warm for our heavy comforter, but nice and cold in the morning. So...I saw this easy project last winter and this rustic metal look goes great with the farm-ish, vintage decor I love. This is a low cost DIY version since real tin houses/lanterns can be really spendy. In the winter I couldn't paint outside, then I forgot over the summer, but had a good day today! It's 62 degrees, unseasonably warm, and a light breeze. The link above shows the project, it's easy peasy. I started with this medium sized $5.99 Hobby Lobby paper mache house. I decided to do one house, and it will be great for a small table display for the holidays.-Roof comes off!Using a well-shaken can of Krylon Silver Hammered Paint ($10.00) I painted the inside and outside of the house-1st coat, looking good!I will do a 2nd coat later today, but it's looking great!

Can't get much easier :)The stinky shirt that kept on givingRemoving Odors From Thrifted Clothing-Well, I had an educational week with my used eBay Eddie Bauer corduroy blouse! I got this beauty on eBay for $10.00, really pretty colors for fall and nice weight for work. I saw the gorgeous fabric thru the plastic bag and excitedly opened it. The odor coming out of the blouse was unfreaking believable!!! OMG, the smell! It was like really bad perfume/chemicals. I always wash all used clothing before wearing, so I threw it in the washer, no worries. It still smelled coming out, so I washed it two more times, more soap, still stunk. I used cold water and our regular laundry soap. Time to do some research, since I wanted to keep the blouse. I went online and found some great ideas here- Thrift Store Clothing Odor/Stain Removal I tried the hot water/baking soda method and it took out 90% of the odor! Eureka!!! I will wash again today and I think that will do it. I did send an FYI letter to the seller, just stating how bad the odors were and what I had to do to remove it. I'm not sure if they applied something or the previous owner did, but it was the WORST I ever smelled on a used piece of clothing. They did apologize and offered a full refund. I declined and I'm happy I salvaged it.You can learn so much online!"},

WOW. While she hasn't posted for a while (for reasons stated in the blog), there's so much cool stuff there! I saw her photo of three of the Hallmark Santa's of the World and I loved them!!! I started looking for some inexpensive ones and eBay to the rescue! Each Santa is from a different country, with something reminiscent of each country. Ireland has a shamrock, etc. They are heavy resin with wonderful detail and very folk art-ish. I found a $5.00 USA Santa first- Next I really scored with a set of six miniatures ornaments for $10.00, what a deal! I will have one duplicate but it will be gifted to River, shh, don't tell."},

We hope our families in Portland will be okay. I woke up yesterday to gusting winds and 70 degrees, yes 70 degrees, at 7 a.m.! It was a warm front ahead of the cold front. The temperature dropped to about 55 by noon, and with windy rain. Dried out a bit, then cloudy. More breezy rain this morning and now it's 65 at 5 p.m. wind is picking up, with more wind/rain expected tomorrow. We really need it in the mountain, but after our horrible Pioneer forest fire, landslides and mudslides are a risk. I LOVE the rain, it's been so dry since July. We have more rain in the forecast for the next week, so I loving it. I'm washing our flannel sheets to put on today. It's till too warm for our winter comforter. Right now we're using our summer quilt with a polar fleece blanket. Soon though, it will be winter! It did drop into the upper 30's a couple of night ago, with some minor frost damage to my squash,plants, but nowhere else. My basil and tomatoes are fine, go figure!  More about the storm here, with great graphics Weather.com We'll slowly put our veggie garden to bed and will start winterizing the coop.

I used to think more was better, but I like having more accent pieces and less clutter. There's also storing everything when not in use. I like less stuff in general! I have my fall things out, and I will put up some inside Halloween things tomorrow. I wanted to do something with one of my kitchen topiaries that was Autumn-ish. I was at Hobby Lobby and found these, perfect for my idea-burlap leaves and faux nutsI decided after seeing those little accents to use them on my sifter topiary.  I made it out of an old vintage sifter, and it's one of my favorite up cycled kitchen decorations- Before pictureAfter picture, simple re-do and easy to change backI did goof up thinking that the little leaves were a garland, but they're hanging pieces. I may make them into that. Sometimes I like to live with things a bit before changing them.About 90% of my fall things I have picked up at thrift stores, the rest at lost cost places like Home Depot or Ross. Fresh pumpkins and gourds are always pretty cheap.

Our white hen started first, then the other 2-Poor girls!With colder weather coming and feather loss I knew it was time for some protein snacks! Feathers are mostly protein so they need more to recover better. You can buy supplements but they can be pretty spendy. I did some research here Raising Happy Chickens.com as well as other places. I started off with some high protein kitten chow \"that chickens love!\". They looked at me seeming to say \"you expect me to eat that!\" No luck. Then I tried drained large sardines packed in tomato sauce, broken up and they inhaled it! Problem solved. You can do meats, cooked eggs, fish, etc, but most suggest not more than 3xs a week. Gwynne's feather are growing back already, good news- Here's a nice generic Chicken Treat Chart, with both winter and summer treats, good ideas there!"},

I'm loving it! Anya dressed in brown for fall!I'm putting away some of my summer clothes and pulling out fall/winter things. I've gotten my fall decor out and will work on that tomorrow. Time flies!This time of year I start thinking ahead of winter prep along with general preparedness. It's also National Prep Month! I got involved with prepping back in 1999 when there was a lot of fear around Y2K issues. I had extra food, water, cash and fuels. Y2K came and went and we used things up eventually. You only have to watch the news to see how many people are caught off guard in all kinds of situations. Weather, nature, floods, fires, you name it. Given the current political state of the world, it's good to look ahead. What if you couldn't get to a grocery store for two weeks? Or a gas station? No water, now what? Stashing extra food is great but what about OTC meds? TP? Emergency home repair items? There are so many little things we don't think of. Tomorrow when I grocery shop I'm going to stock up on low cost barbecue chicken parts. I freeze them for the winter ans great deals! I' making pesto to freeze and minestrone soup from my garden tomatoes as well. I'm enjoying freezing things for a quick thaw on a crazy work night! I'll be checking our flashlights, batteries and more.Last year I did a nice blog post about this very topic It's National Prep Month! and this in 2014 Prepping Information Here's a great podcast with lots of info here Thesurvivalpodcast.com  It's titled Zero To Prepared – Fast, Simple and Low Cost Part One. Not all of it will apply to everyone, so see what if any might work for you. There are lots of great websites out there so browse around on as well. I discovered this solar light, recently, easy to install, LED and and BRIGHT! MicroSolar LED Barn Light  -I first saw this on Leigh's post at 5acresandadream.com  I will probably get one for our coop, and some may want to stash a few of those for emergency power outages. I could see running the cord inside (thru a window, etc) and using inside with some creativity! They'd also be great for a tiny house, cabin's, etc. My 600th Post!!!Wow, I can't believe I hit 600 posts! When I changed jobs it cut into my time to blog, but has helped me keep my sanity :) I love writing and it helps me feel connected to the rest of the world out there.

I think the soaker hose really helped with production.Copycat Olive Garden Salad-When we had some pasta recently (with my sauce!) I made this to go with dinner- Food.com  Awesome! I left out the tomatoes since we had a lot in the sauce. Yum yum! I did use Oliver Garden's salad dressing from Costco and substituted romaine. I haven't eaten iceberg lettuce for years, yuck.

Pear Harvest and Crumble Pie", "date": "Sep 11, 2016", "text": "Vietnamese Pork Chops w/ Cucumber Radish Salad-It's starting to feel a bit like Autumn! Cooler/shorter days, and nights. I ran across this article for some summer-to-fall decorating ideas, 6 Easy Way to Transition From Summer To Fall, fun stuff! It's been fall harvest time here the last 2 weekends, with pesto and marinara sauce to make from our tomatoes still to come! I love cooking pork in the fall, and I recently found this recipe- RachaelRaymag.com  I decided to try it since I already had most of the ingredients. I bought 4 nice chops and went for it. I wasn't sure about eating radish greens, but they were actually good! The result? Excellent, juicy meat and mild veggies. I did use a jalapeno pepper, with no seeds, diced. Next time I would slice them since we didn't get much heat. All in all, a keeper! This could also work for chicken or beef.Applesauce Time!We had a moderate harvest of our Pippin apples this year. Between giving our kids apples,and eating them fresh/baked ourselves, we really didn't have a huge amount to can. With my recent back issues I decided to make my thick/chunky applesauce last weekend on the stove and freeze it. Easy peasy! I left the skin on, good fiber, nutrition. I bought four new 3.8 pint, BPA-free freezer containers. I wasn't sure if that would be enough, but I filled all four, making about 1 gallon- To process the apples I washed, cored, and cut off the bad spots. I sliced and put in my giant pot, with several inches of water. I started on high, then after 10 minutes reduced to medium high. I kept stirring from the bottom and put the lid on. Keep checking the progress very 10 minutes. Once soft I started with a potato masher, then added water to thin as needed. I then switched to submersible blender, perfect for this application. I added a little sugar, fresh lemon juice, pinch of salt, then cinnamon, and fresh nutmeg to taste. I like spiced applesauce!  You could leave out the spices if you wish. You can use on top of pork chops with garlic, onion and ginger. You could also use in an apple bread/cake.Pear Harvest and Crumble Pie-We kept waiting for our organic Bartlett pears to soften up on the tree, but when they started falling off it was time to pick them yesterday. We had about 35 pears, our largest crop yet! We planted the tree about 3 or 4 years ago, so this was a good harvest. The flavor is great! I decided to try this recipe and Dave loves baked pears- Pear Pie Crumble  It's also a keeper!I used fresh nutmeg instead of cinnamon in the filling, but added both to the topping. The slices were nice and tender but not mushy. I used the ripest pears for this.I have the rest of the pears slowly ripening on the table-I'm going to try this recipe as well Autumn Pear Bread and use some of our excellent eggs :)Are you ready for Autumn?"},

Work has been crazy busy and I wanted to do something fun! Since we basically spent our vacation time/vacation $$$ on painting our house in May we're basically done with vacations for now. So... I had some painting projects in mind. I had seen some china cabinets similar to mine, with a nice dark cherry stain. We bought it at Goodwill as it was being brought out onto the floor for about $80. That was ten years ago after we bought this house. It was small and fit into our kitchen/dining room perfectly. It was missing the 2 glass shelves (and brackets) so I measured exactly and bought 2 new shelves to replace them. They fit!!! Dave installed some replacement brackets. Lately I thought about doing the \"paint it white and add chicken wire\" thing, but I like the warm cherry color and grain. I think it might be mahogany? \"Before\" picture, nice contrast to the light wall color-I stumbled onto a few photos a while back and it gave me an idea-Why not paint the inside? I did some research and these colors are a variation of Robin's Egg Blue. I brought home several paint chips and found a nice chalk-type paint at a big box store. I didn't want to go too minty so I bought this-\"Serene\"I wiped down the inside with a damp cloth with Dawn. I taped off the edges and used kitchen parchment paper to cover the bottom-My goal was to do the inside sides only. It took 2 coats, not a surprise. I used a brush on the edges and a medium sized foam roller on the walls. Worked great! I even have some paint left! I'm happy with the result!!! It's lighter inside and brighter. I also down-sized the items inside. I donated some and stored the rest of the seasonal items-All done!I bought some cherry toned Danish Oil and will do the legs and rest of the wood tomorrow. It will mask some of the wear marks and protect the finish. Then it will really be all done!!! Link for paint, come in several colors-                                                Painting project #2- I had a nice wall shelf that was a matte black I bought it used after we bought this house. I wanted some vertical storage. Last year when I re-painted the kitchen I decided to paint it a medium blue. I checked 3 stores for a satin blue and couldn't find it. I went with glossy navy and I was not happy! It looked almost black in the lighting, but I decided to live with it- I finally found my paint, much better!Painting job # 3 is an old oak dining chair we had from our big family dining set years ago. When we downsized and donated the set we kept one chair. It was ready for a makeover, worn but still sturdy-Lots of nice scroll workI went with bright white satin paint to go with our other spare chairs-It was just about ready to start raining, so I painted the 1st coat in the garage. Second coat tomorrow! I'm really glad I didn't try to paint it with a brush! I have some glaze I may use to enhance the carved areas. I will wait until the paint cures more. I may add a blue plaid chair cushion to it, to tie together with my other chairs.Fave DIY Makeovers-While browsing thru Pinterest I saw the china cabinet above. What a great idea! No glass? Put in fabric! I love the red and blue together. I also found this, an old Grandfather clock stripped down of the mechanisms and shelves added. Great idea! Just some paint and distressed-Not my photo!Easy French Bread Pizzas w/Garden Tomatoes-Last week I decided to make some French bread pizza, for something different. I bought a medium size baguette on the way home. I sliced it down the center and cut 2 good sized chucks. We each would have 2 slices. I topped with these ingredients in order-Garlic powder, 3 leftover provolone slices (3) torn, 1/4 cup shredded Parmesan, 1/2 cup fresh shredded mozzarella cheese, fresh oregano, several fresh sliced garden tomatoes. Pre-heat your oven to 375 degrees. Once all your ingredients are on the bread put on a baking sheet in the oven at 375 degrees for about 8 to 10 minutes. At this point turn up the heat to 425 degrees F. When the cheese has started to bubble, bread looks toasted and veggies are soft, you're done!  In my oven it was about 5 minutes. You could also broil if needed. Serve hot! The bread was nice and crunchy and I topped with fresh basil. Perfecto!!!Autumn's Coming!We've had a real shift in the weather the last 2 days. High in the low upper 60's/low 70's. I love it! While it was odd to see a Winter Weather Advisory in the mountains, we need it. Idaho currently has the largest forest fire in the U.S., but it doesn't make the national news. Named the Pioneer Fire, most of it is in unpopulated areas. It's at about 175, 000 acres!From Idahostatesman.comI'm hoping for some substantial rain soon. We need to get that fire out and wet things down here. The radar is looking like rain is heading in this evening, happy dance. With a low of 45 I'll be throwing on another blanket!!! Come on rain!!!"},

We bought a new front loading washer and a year and a 1/2 ago. After having 2 new control panels installed (under warranty) it started to go wonky again last week. No warranty now, and another defective replacement control panel, AGAIN, and we decided we're done. I did some research on Consumer Reports online. I wasn't aware that the technology on top loaders had changed a lot. They use less water and more gentle on clothes. We bought a new washer, with KNOBS, top loading, water saving, with no standard agitator to beat up the clothes. It also spins more water out of the clothes,  coming out dryer, reducing drying time. It has a small raised area in the center and is a large capacity- We bought a 5 year warranty as well. All in all I'm happy with the new washer, but pissed that we got stuck with a piece of crap. We went thru this with our last glass-topped range. The control panel died. It was $500.00 to replace OR buy a new range for less. We opted for a new range. When our current one dies I want a gas range with KNOBS. No more control panels EVER. At least I can see what's in the washer easily, no more bending and twisting to see if I got the last sock! Mystery Tomato Solved-I was really scratching my head when I started finding BIG orange tomatoes in the garden. I couldn't for the life of me figure out what they were! After looking at it and slicing it open it turned out to be a Persimmon Tomato.  Dave remembered the name when I mentioned it. I had never tried these before, a heritage variety. I will say this variety is amazing! Large, ripens early and very, very  sweet-blurry, sorryThis weekend's veggie harvest was good! We have raspberries, and  jalapenos too, but forgot to pick them- Time to make salsa!!!Thrifting Scores-I found a great little gray speckled teapot, like new for $3.00- and this new set of 3 prints for $10.00 I loved the cow and chicken!

I LOVE them!Free Coffee Sign-Speaking of wall art... After spending some time looking for an easy, DIY coffee sign for my back splash, I finally gave up. I made the sign above with a simple word doc, adding a background color. I put it into my chalk paint style frame (thrifted) and hung it up. I like it!!!

Life has been crazy with a back issue I have been dealing with for 2 months :( Dave has been great picking up the slack, but it was mentally exhausting. The good news is now things are getting much better! Happy dance!  So moving on.... This is our \"bean garden\" area we created last year when we down-sized our shed and decided to use the space for more food production. My beans pooped out last year, but did great this year! I planted Blue Lake Bush beans (I think)  no trellis needed. We used a soaker hose and they've done really well! They're loaded and last night I picked enough for 2 big dinner portions- I cooked 3 strips of bacon, with a diced small purple onion. I added the beans when that was cooked and added a little boiling water, excellent! The onion turned a bit sweet and combined with the bacon we wiped it out :) More on the plants to come! Sorry for the blurNote my huge lemon tomato! Weird!We're also getting a goof harvest of lemon cukes, tomatoes, basil, peppers and squash.My fave summer salad- cukes, tomatoes, olive oil, balsamic vinegar and basilWe're also getting a steady, small supply of raspberriesBefore shot, soil turnedNext New Garden Bed-After Dave cleaned out our garden \"junk drawer\" corner, we decided to plant something on the L shaped section. On the right chicken wire side we will plant a nice Ouachita Thornless Blackberry we found locally for $8.99, with 2 big long branches. We held off planting this week, with temps pushing 100. We'll plant it in a few days, since it will be cooler. I'll plant a shrub in the fall that we need to relocate in front of the fence to finish it off. Maybe some annuals next spring? I asked Dave to add compost and  move some extra river stones from our little pond area to create a border. It looks more finished and ready to plant-I may plant another pollinator in front of the vines like this one-Poesy the neighbor cat cooling off in the heat :)Antique/Thrifting Annex Mall Find!I received an email from Yelp with the title Thrifting Finds, and  thought... what? Where? So I read it. It turns our what I thought was a small store is a 30,000 sq. foot warehouse, the Antique World Mall It has lots of different vendors, with large furniture to small items. While we didn't make it all the way through here are some shots of some of what I saw. Good prices and lots of variety!Nice dishesFiesta ware Farmy fun stuffLove the display!!!I bought the vintage green spoon, $6.00 to go with my other green collection. I will go back again when we have more time, as it was a huge place!Apple Harvest-Our apples are getting ripe so I made am lasagna-pan sized cobbler with blueberries. I'll be canning soon! We gave our kids bags of apples (organic Pippins) but there' are more on the tree. I took a extra day off over the upcoming Labor Day holiday weekend, so I'll have 4 days off. Looking forward to that, and processing all the apples. Pears are still not quite ripe but BIG!"},
{"title": "Reclaim Paint Review & Chalk Paint Table Makeover, Micro Urban Homesteading Garden, New Grandbaby Gender! ", "date": "Aug 7, 2016", "text": "Reclaim Paint Review & Chalk Paint Table Makeover-Last year I was asked to review Reclaim Paint (now re-named to Beyond Paint) and was gifted with paint, glaze and sealer. I chose Bright White and was sent one Qt.-                                                         I had plans to paint two tables last fall then I changed jobs. I put it on the back burner for warmer weather. Now, time to paint! Reclaim paint is advertised as an ultra thick, gorgeous, low prep paint. What's not to love? It comes in a wide range of colors. I had two tables to do and a couple of craft projects. I did table #1 today, will do #2 on upcoming Labor Day weekend. The first thing I noticed when it came in the mail was how HEAVY is is! I test drove it first this winter on my cardboard box turned to a Faux French Country Planter Box -andand my little soap crateandmy medium sheep crate So, here's how it went today, with my little side table to be made over...\"Before\" pictureThis was my Mom's table, who passed away years ago, and while I love the lines it was dark and didn't go with anything else. I started thinking of Scandinavian country with the curvy lines. White it is! I washed the table down with some Dawn and finished with a white vinegar/water wipe. Nice and clean, I set up my paint area on my deck, plastic on the table. The area outside was warm and breezy today, and with our dry weather a good time to paint-Since the table has such long legs I decided to paint it upside down to start, and paint the top last-I removed the knob and saved it to re-use, see the big scratch on the drawer?First coat, I knew it would need atleast two with the dark finishI flipped it over after the second coat, then did the top and lower shelf. A few touch ups later I put the knob back on and took inside, back to my living room-  I thought about some grain sack striping on the top and on the drawer like this-From ArtsychicksruleI have decided to live with the simple white for a while. It would be easy enough to add stripes later.I just tend to shy away from anything too \"trendy\" and grain sack stripes are a big trend. A lot of people may be repainting to get rid of those in a few years! Here's the other small craft painting items I did as well- \"Before\" picture,  my .69 cent thrifted bunny2 coats of Reclaim paint later, loving it!I also painted a small frame, blond wood before, now ready for a botanical print-All in all I'm really impressed with the paint and coverage! I used 2 sponge craft brushes and a small craft bristle brush. It was a lot of leg painting, so I was fine with a not-perfect surface. The top came out super smooth. Less strokes is better. It's almost a bit of a cross between chalk paint and low sheen/satin flat finish. I was going to glaze the table but I want to think about it. I will also seal the top with a sealer I was given, to protect from any water damage etc. Since it's a sturdy wood table I want to protect the finish. With the one qt. I still have about 1/3 to 1/2 left, plenty for my other table. With that flat table I would use a roller. All in all great stuff!Corn, squash beets and beansMicro Urban Homesteading Garden-My daughter Angie and her husband Chris are both gardeners and real DIYers. They're renting a tiny house with a micro backyard, but have done a tone of work with it. The results have paid off! I wish I had \"before\" pictures. Just visualize a dirt back yard! They added a small amount of turf for a sitting/dog area, gravel path/border, then veggies and even a peach tree! I'm so proud of them!!!They used pallets to go vertical on the back fence, with herbs and flowers, tons of tomatoes in front,  Angie used chalk paint on the pallets, cute!Flowers, tomatoes, beans, peppers, going vertical!Chris built a wishing well from pallets as wellcold frame of strawberriesWe had a baby gender reveal party there Friday so I couldn't get more shots of their yard, with lots of people there. It's extremely productive garden for the small space they have. They served a beet salad and amazing corn from their garden at their party, yum!!!New Grand Baby Gender!-At the party Friday night it was revealed that our next Grand baby (due in December) will be a BOY! His name will be Oliver, for my hubby's old family name, sweet. Grand baby River is doing great and we baby sat for 4 hours last night, what fun!!! Last week River he was thinking- Should I wake up or sleep, I'm so confused!"},

Shown above at Goodwill I found two like-new one cup Polish Pottery teapots. My sister-in-law is of Polish origin and introduced me to their unique and gorgeous designs years ago. I recognized the colors and similar patterns. I got these two for $1.99 each! I found the vintage Newport silver plated tray for $2.00. It was really tarnished but cleaned up nicely. Perfect for the holiday, for food, or my creamer set. I found a new bamboo cutting board I needed, $5.00. I also found a nice, new-ish work blouse for $4.00. Silver tray, reflection of lemons :)I found some adorable baby clothes for my Grandson River, several onesies, khaki pants and this summer overall, perfect with his safari themed bedroom! $2.00, cute seersucker, cool in the summer-My daughter loved it too!Today at a local thrift store I found a like new Land's End summer/spring jacket, navy blue with chambray trim, fit perfect, $4.00. I also found this bunny destined for some chalk paint for my French Country spring display. It's scratched up hollow clay so should take paint well, a whopping .69 cents, love it!!!  Cost Plus World Market recently moved into a much larger location. I had a 50% off coupon so we went on a field trip since we were up in that area. I knew I'd find something there! They had so MANY cute Mason jar like items I was tempted. I remembered I needed Olive oil and decided to get this large jug 1/2 off $20.00, now only $10.00, score!All in all a very good batch of deals!!! Happy dance~~~100+ Degrees-It's just been so HOT lately, ugh. Thanks to A/C it could be much worse. The garden and trees etc. have been getting watered, but it just seems constant :(  85 is forecast for Wed., so a bit cooler. Hens have been getting cool treats and we're keeping the shade area well-watered and the mister on as well. A bit cooler tonite, 77 at 9:30 p.m. It's been in the 80's when we've been going to bed! I'm ready for fall. On the good side- we are getting out first tomatoes and I had my 1st amazing lemon cuke yesterday, still warm from the sun, delish! Tons of tomatoes on the vines, they seem to do well with the soaker hoses and extra hand watering. So far, so good. We have pears ripening (40 or 50 maybe?), still a bit hard but BIG. I see a French pear tart in my future!!! I'm groaning looking at all the apples on the tree, but will can again this summer and give some to my kiddos. Fast, Frugal Healthy Dinner-I bought some of these salmon burgers last week at my local grocery store. I has bought something similar in the past at Costco. They were 4 burgers for $2.99. I made us each 2 for dinner since they were only 4 oz. I fried them in a little olive oil with dill and lemon pepper. Sorry no pics! I served with green salad, fresh lemon slices, and corn on the cob. I figured the whole dinner per person, was about $2.50 or so. I also used some Ikea lemon dill sauce, making it extra yummy. It looked much better than the photos above. Try some! I do make homemade salmon patties sometimes, but on a work night this is a faster option..."},

When you have in-laws we share the holidays :)  We had Muffuletta sandwichs (easy to make ahead of time), watermelon, green salad (from daughter), drinks (from other daughter)  and my apple blueberry cobbler. I love making great, healthy, flavorful meals and watching others inhale them! If I had the $ to potentially lose I'd love to open a little cafe, just cook and stand back and watch others enjoy the meals. It was 95 degrees yesterday so we ate inside. About 85 today. We went and saw the new Independence Day Resurgence movie today, excellent! We cleaned cars, did yard work then went to the movie. Good choice. Here's to a relaxing day for you!!!Independence Days Challenge-Here's a small snippet, lucky we had a four day weekend!!!1. Plant Something- We ripped out some invasive lamb's ear and an old yarrow. We replaced with a deep blueberry colored Echinacea and a reddish yarrow. Looks much better!  It was all overgrown and needed to be thinned. This is a strip next to our driveway dividing our lots and the neighbors. We've let it get a bit overgrown. Next weekend I'm pruning big time!!! 2. Harvest Something- Lots of eggs, chives, basil, thyme, oregano, rosemary, marionberries, raspberries, still waiting on tomatoes and other veggies but we have lots! Flowers are doing great-old EchinaceaShasta daisiesMy $5.00 geranium's huge and blooms constantly!Peaches getting big! Apples and pears are coming along3. Preserve/Store Something- Freezing breads, cheeses on sale. Canning will wait for the apple harvest. Will start pickling veggies soon. I may can dill pickles this year, haven't decided yet. Fermenting certainly is more sour.4. Manage Reserves- Get a GoodDeal/Barter/Stock Up/Prep- Dave got a new vacuum 40% off after our's died. Good timing. Had a $10.00 off $40.00 purchase at a local feed store. Bought 4 bags of bark dust, wild bird food, and the 2 new plants. 5. Eat the Food- Try NewFoods/Recipe- Using up more of my canned apple slices for cobblers.  Found a new strawberry cream pie recipe :) Saving that for next weekend.6. Build Community Food Systems- Giving the kids eggs, will go to a farmer's market soon now that warm weather crops are coming in. Still buying local artisan breads at our local discount store.7. Recycle/Re-Use- Made charity donations recently, with another bag to go. Giving chickens leftovers as usual.8. Skill Up- Nothing off the top of my head.9. Regenerate What is Lost/SalvageSomething- Got some old blackberries re-growing better with more soil (winter erosion), water and fertilizer. They look great! Dave reseeded part of the yard in our turf after paint spilled during or painting the house :("},

I think we're settling into more of a normal pattern of heat. It was in the low 80's yesterday after a cool down (time to water!) and 92 today with 100 tomorrow. It's 62 right now at 9:30 a.m,  nice :) I hit some yard work early, including thinning some apples off our tree. We had a big branch laying on the front of the roof from the weight of the fruit. Not good! I'm just doing some other normal stuff, a little weeding, etc. Our veggies are great, growing fast. The chickens ate the foliage off on of my squashes so I'll replace that little fence, and stake up the tomatoes. They loved the rain! Inside I have my summer decor up and some goodies for the 4th-I love my thrifted chicken!!!my \"sea table\"My fave prim chunky flag I madeI have been doing some thrifting for my 2nd expecting daughter (due in Dec.), and found a really expensive diaper bag for $4.00.  I washed it and it came out looking like new. I found some infant baby clothes for her , and 2 jackets for my new grandson River, who's really growing. I found a little salsa bowl out shopping yesterday a Target for a couple of bucks, cute!My daughter did give me permission to post photos of Grandbaby River, just no naked ones! She and I are on the same page as far as respecting each other's privacy. Some have no boundaries when posting online and don't know how to think about long term ramifications of posting everything on social media. My 3 adult girls and I have had excellent conversations about that. Once something is on the internet it's there for good. Deleting an account, etc. will NOT get that it completely off the net. Better to be proactive and protect your privacy. Anyway, here's River from a few days ago-a little squirmy and blurry, but healthyWe may do a one day road trip to get out of town over the 4th. I will host a dinner here on the 3rd for all the kids. We used a lot of vacation painting the house, but it was a one time project, so it's OK. No real vacation this year, just a few long weekends. I am SO looking forward to RETIRING some day! Ah, the luxury of just being able to stay home if you want to, volunteer, work part time, do big projects at home as needed, etc. I'll probably throw away my alarm clock!!! Soon...Sweet Hot Onion Relish-I have made this before and it's great in the summer! Spicy, crunchy, sweet/sour. Recipe is here- Splendidtable.org   I hand sliced these as my cheap food processor over did it. Chill your onions before slicing to reduce the fumes, and add the pepper seeds if you want it hotter. I let it sit 2 days, and added a little seasoned rice wine vinegar to beef up the liquid. I'm making some today for the weekend, a double batch! It will keep for a few weeks. Yum. With the long weekend coming up (we're taking Friday off too, hooray!) I'll make a giant batch of corn relish as well. Keeps great and here's my version if you want to give it a try LittlehomesteadinBoise Corn Relish Egg & Oats Protein Recipe-I kept vacillating yesterday between eggs for breakfast or oats. I remembered making baked oats with eggs, but that is a big batch. I looked online for an idea about putting an egg into cooked rolled oats. I made this eggy oatmeal. I did my normal thick rolled oats with raisins, added one of my hens eggs and cooked for 5 minutes. A little sugar and milk and delish! Here's an official recipe- Protein Oatmeal"},
{"title": "How To Do Copper Leaf Crafts, It's Pesto Time! Fast & Frugal Gourmet Chicken Salad Sandwiches", "date": "Jun 19, 2016", "text": "How To Do Copper Leaf Crafts-This is such an cheap, easy process, I thought I'd share it! When we bought our current house, a single story ranch the garage needed a little something up above for interest. For $10.00 I bought a sage green painted metal folk art type star. I was in a craft store and saw a package of Copper Leaf and had a eureka! moment. I copper leafed the star, sprayed with a clear poly spray to protect it from the weather. After 10 years it looked like this-Not bad, but it needed a face lift. It used to be above the garage door-Since we painted the house and installed a vent in that spot I decided to re-do it for another spot on the front of the house, centered between our bedroom windows. New much-needed ventFor $12.00 I bought a small package of copper leaf-photo is of gold but it's copper insideThe standard craft size seems to be 4\" x 4\" and about 25 sheets. I did the whole star and have some left over. You can buy special glue, and I was going to use some spray adhesive that I already had. Sadly it has TERRIBLE fumes and you can't do this outside in any kind of wind or draft. It turned into an inside project. Close up \"before\", after 10 years in the weather, not bad really!I worked on my dining table with paper towels underneath. To prep I brushed and wiped the surface with a dry cloth and worked on as it. Theoretically I could have washed it with TSP but why bother? I wanted the rustic look. I used some Elmer's wood glue, applied with a craft sponge. Pour on, sponge on, and do a small section at time-Spread on a thin coating, you want a tacky surface- Very carefully use one sheet of copper leaf at a time, it's sandwiched between thin paper sheets-  Just leave in place in the \"book\" and press on the tacky glue, tear off the paper pages as you go-I used a small paint brush to flatten the copper leaf on gently- Looking better already!I worked all the way around, overlapping as needed. I let dry overnight. 2nd round of leafingThe next day I brushed off the loose copper excess and did the process again. Just fill in any gaps and empty spots, dry overnight again. Wipe off the rest of the excess and spray with clear poly to protect from the outdoor elements. Re-hung and we're done! With the left over copper from last time I covered a cheap plastic and metal yard art \"sun\". Much better! Still holding up well 10 years later but it has been inside, I moved it outside. Looks good on the new gray paint! What could you use copper leaf with???                                                         It's Pesto Time!I planted a pot full of basil seeds recently, but I also bought 3 large plants. Time to make pesto! I used my fave recipe, Rosie's Pesto, fast and simple, low fat to boot! I used it with some roasted chicken I had left over. Just heat in an skillet with a little olive oil and warm thru.I tossed the chicken into pasta. Serve with salad and french bread, it's what's for dinner!Fast & Frugal Gourmet Chicken Salad Sandwiches-Speaking of chicken.... I bought two 2-pack cans of precooked chicken breast on sale. I don't usually buy canned cooked meats, but I thought it would be useful for a fast dinner on a I'm too tired to cook night. I have made tarragon chicken salad before but wanted something with more flavor. I combined a few recipes, and included my organic sweet pickles from Ikea. Give it a try! I served on toasted Challah (clearance price!) buns with pickles, chips and veggies. The whole batch with chicken and buns was about $8.00 including what I already had. Makes 6 large sandwiches! You could also serve as a salad with greens.IngredientsMeat- two 12 oz cans of cooked chicken breast, or use your own roasted chicken, COLD1 cup diced Celery1/2 cup diced Red onion1/2 cup diced sweet pickles2 TBL fresh Tarragon from my garden,or 1TBL dried2 TBL Dijon mustard2 TBL Lemon juice1/2 cup MayonnaiseBlack pepper to tasteAdd mayo, lemon juice and mustard in a bowl, mix well. Add chicken, and the rest of the ingredients and toss well. Refrigerate while you prep the rest of the meal. Serve on toasted buns! Great on a hot night! This will be great with sliced, home grown, fresh garden tomatoes soon! Basil would work well too. Keeps well too, enjoy!"},
{"title": "Independence Days Challenge, Record Heat!", "date": "Jun 5, 2016", "text": "Independence Days Challenge- Sometimes I forget that while we live in an urban area all kinds of \"wildlife\" comes out :)  A cute little American Quail pair visited last week. I always love the little flag on top! The female is on the ground right below near the 4\"x 4\". Fun! Here's a run down of some things we've been doing lately here at our little homestead!1. Plant Something-We planted our veggie garden the last 2 weekends, most of it with our 3 days off last weekend for the holiday. No more \"summer break\" for me, sadly! I planted my herb box, and seeds for calendula, nasturtiums and tons of basil. I love to make little jars of pesto to freeze. I did cheat by buying a large pot of basil! Yum yum.2. Harvest Something-Herbs and eggs. I found 2 eggs last week, one a little bitty one! I think one of the hens laid 2? 3. Preserve/Store Something-Nothing right now. I will be canning and freezing fruit later this summer with a good crop on our 3 fruit trees. 4. Manage Reserves- Get a GoodDeal/Barter/Stock Up/Prep- I got a new watch little Timex digital \"gardening/dirt\" watch on Amazon for $15.00, a blouse on eBay, a polar fleece jacket at a yard sale, and some thrifted baby clothes for my new grand baby! We were gifted with a bag of baby things from my hubby's co-worker who used to run a day care center. One of those gifts was a fold up playpen/crib! Free is a very good price! I'll buy a thicker piece of foam and make some sheets :) I told hubby to thank her profusely!We also had a free dinner with points built up on our saver card at our fave local Greek restaurant. Opa! Speaking of which, we saw My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2 last night. It is hysterical if you want a good laugh!!! We found some nice 50' soaker hoses for $10.00 each at Home Depot. We are now using those in the veggie gardens. We stretched them out for a week in the sun, mush easier to use-Kale, french radishes, green onions and herbs plantedBush bean seed planted with soaker hose, previous shed area. Now food production!I sent the hens in there last weekend and they did a great job tilling the soil :)Tomatoes, squash, 3 kinds of peppers planted5. Eat the Food- Try NewFoods/Recipe-I made a new blueberry cobbler, now working on freezer food. Tonite I sauteed 1 huge purple onion with a little olive oil, balsamic vinegar and salt and put on top of brats, yummy! Cook down for about 45 minutes till nice and soft.6. Build Community Food Systems-Giving my kids eggs, and I may start selling some at work. No local farmers markets yet, too early.I may sell some excess fruit at work this year, with peaches, apples and pears coming in strong this year! 7. Recycle/Re-Use-Donated some clothes to charity, bought baby things. I made $40.00 selling used, leftover fencing on Craigslist today-I also have a like-new Fossil purse for sale I bought for $3.00 at a yard sale last summer. It's too small for me. Easy way to earn some money! It also keeps things like the fencing out of the landfills.8. Skill Up-I am learning a LOT about infants. Big changes since 27 years ago when I had mine. We got more familiar with the soaker hoses we bought. Smaller than the ones years ago and more water efficient. I knew with working thru the summer that I wouldn't be watering as much on my off time. I bought 1, then we bought a 2nd. They use less water and you can turn them on and walk away. 9. Regenerate What is Lost/SalvageSomething-I will be re-copper leafing a metal star for our home's exterior. More later on how to do that! I saw this inspiration yesterday at a Re-Store store, cute! Maybe some furniture painting in my future?I might do something like this...Record Heat!96 was in the forecast for today, with more heat again tomorrow. That is HOT, but it's 115 in Phoenix so I won't complain too much. We may get a thunderstorm tonite and tomorrow night, hopefully with rain and not starting any forest fires. We deep cleaned the chicken waterers today and we've been watering extra the last 3 days. I think it was about 95 today. Tomorrow I will set up our mister for the coop. I water around the coop as well and in their shade area-Cool shade area for the hens, wraps around behind the coop. One of my better ideas! Last year's veggie garden, good shade in the afternoon...What's the temp where you are???"},

{"title": "RECIPES!!! Muffuletta Sandwich, Chocolate Pound Cake, Nancy's Blueberry Apple Cobbler", "date": "May 29, 2016", "text": "Muffuletta Sandwich- I remembered how much I loved this sandwich so I made it for a couple of busy days dinners. It's from New Orleans, tons of flavor! The recipe is listed but can be modified. Use a baguette or large loaf of crusty French bread. For the meats and cheese use 4 slices of Genoa/dry salami and provolone cheese           Olive salad-            1 cup black olives, chopped           1 cup of green olives with pimentos, chopped           1 Tbl. tiny capers           1/3 roasted red bell pepper, diced           2 tsp. garlic, minced           1/4 cup diced celery with leaves           2 Tbl. red wine vinegar           6 pepperoncini peppers, stems removed, chopped           2 Tbl. chopped flat leaf parsley           pepper to taste           2 Tbl. olive oilEnough for 4 large sandwiches. This would also be great with fresh, ripe garden tomatoes. Begin by making your olive salad first. Chop and mix everything in a bowl, then store in sealed container in the fridge for at least 2 hours. Slice the Italian round loaf horizontally, then remove some of the interior of the bread to make a nice scooped out area (my chickens love the soft bread). Place a generous amount of the olive salad on the base of the bread. Then layer the the slices of salami, then the provolone cheese, then add a layer of olive salad on top, placing the top of the bread on top. Push down slightly, then wrap tightly in foil or plastic and refrigerate for at least an hour. Don't skip this step! When ready, cut into half and serve! Makes about 4 large servings, depending on how hungry you are. I serve with chips and veggies. I have served it to guests and they LOVED it, not heavy, but very bright and filling. Perfect for a hot day! Just make the salad and sandwiches ahead and serve. Sorry, I took picture the day after!Chocolate Pound Cake-I found this recipes years ago in a magazine and it's a good solution for a simple dessert that keeps well and uses my eggs. It's better the 2nd day!Ingredients-8 ozs. softened butter, 2 1/2 cups sugar, 1 tsp vanilla, 1 cup unsweetened cocoa powder, 5 eggs (I used 6), 2 1/2 cups cake flour, 1 tsp. baking power, 1/2 tsp salt, 1 cup and 4 Tbl milk.  Heat oven to 325 degrees, oil a bundt pan, beat butter, vanilla and sugar until fluffy. Fold in cocoa powder. Add eggs and beat well.  Mix flour, baking powder, salt and gradually add to chocolate mixture, thinning with milk as you go. Mix well. Bake for 1 hour and check for cake doneness. Mine took 1 hour and 15 mins. Cool completely and remove from pan. Sprinkle with powered sugar. Great with stiff whipping cream! Keeps very well. Enjoy!!!Photo from website belowNancy's Blueberry Apple Cobbler-Last week I was wanting to use some of my home-canned organic apple slices for a dessert. I was a bit bored with just apples, so I got online and search. Since I had some frozen blueberries I decided to try this recipe TheCupboard.net. It was fabulous! Simple and had a wonderful flavor. I served it warm with a little vanilla ice cream.

I found this aluminum lawn chair back in the 80's abandoned under my apartment deck. Covered with cobwebs, ripped webbing and filthy I could see the potential! I bought some blue webbing and replaced it and had a great chair. Last year the webbing finally gave out. I stored it and brought it out this month. I found new blue and green replacement webbing online on eBay for $15.00 and Dave decided to re-do it for me. Thanks Hon! Simply remove the old webbing with a screw driver and don't lose the screws! Ours were intact, so we reused them. You carefully measure the webbing for each row (do one direction at a time) and cut the ends straight. Use a very sharp pair of scissors! You then fold the webbing into a V and screw the screw into the webbing and the holes, tighten and move on! Easy peasy. I think we're good for another 30 years! Old webbing coming offCorners of new webbing screwed in.Mini Road Trip-We've been behind in planting our veggie garden. Between the baby shower and painting the house it was delayed. We did plant some herbs and kale last weekend though! This weekend was supposed to be for planting everything else, but nature had other plans. Rain. All. Weekend. So we decided with the 3 day weekend next weekend we'd wait. What to do? Road trip for the day to McCall. Who cares if it rains in the gorgeous mountains, with great views, and good food. We had a nice lunch at a local brewery grill, delish! Sadly I didn't find anything at my regular thrift store, oh well. There was some snow on the mountain peaks, but at about 45 degrees, so not too bad.We stopped at Stacy's Cake's for a dessert before leaving McCall and I LOVE this bathroomshelf! Flystrike- A Chicken Killer-As a small flock chicken owner it's really frustrating to lose a hen you've raised from a day old chick. I lost one hen to Flystrike a few years back. When I saw this article recently I decided to share it. It may save your birds life! I wish I had spotted it sooner, but I saw what was happening one day before I lost her. Better to know now... Flystrike-A Chicken Killer"},

There will be some touching up to do, which we expected, but it looks SO much better! We went thru Consumer Reports and chose one of their best buys. A good paint really does cover better and lasts much longer. We also used brushes for better coverage. Looking good! All the neighbors have commented on how much they like the color combo.

So no blog posts! I finally slept thru the night last week. I won't bore you with the details but prescription meds where involved, ick. Dave kept to his paint prep schedule and our neighbor loaned him his pressure washer! Awesome, and Dave cleaned the house and the back deck. What a difference! Our Trex decking is gray and about 10 years old. While I have scrubbed it in the past the deck pressure washing made it look new! We also found an area around one bedroom window with water coming, time to re-caulk. We FINALLY finished choosing our new paint color, going from beige (boring) to a gray with darker denim blue/gray trim. With the red brick we think it will be a nice combo. We did a test paint area, great idea. We also took down our four old icky plastic front shutters. Dave made more cedar trim for the windows and garage door, much nicer. He had already made these for the back as it needed something after we installed our new windows years ago. Photos soon...Bye bye shutters and beige paint!Baby Shower-I offered to host and coordinate a baby shower for my daughter, who is due with our first Grandchild in early June. Coordinating with 3 others daughters has been a bit of a challenge. I tend to be very detailed oriented and write things down. In the long run it came together. Since the group was bigger than I was expecting I moved it outside to our back yard. I had planned on an inside shower since April is dicey weather-wise, but it was 65 and sunny today. My neighbor loaned us outside tables and chairs as she used to cater weddings. I bought some fun jungle themed decor and we had the food inside. I created a drink bar (no alcohol) on my garden bench outside covering it with a burlap runner (sorry no pics). I added balloons and fresh gerbera daisies. Everyone loved it! We ate, drank, played games and they (Dad attended too) opened gifts. Off to bed, I pooped!!! What a great day.My daughter Michelle's original artwork for the nursery, with thick felt, very tactile!

I saw an Ikea shot that inspired me, since I pretty bored with the white on white I see everywhere else. I'm not trendy and I can live with that! Too much white can be too flat visually in my opinion.  From Ikea Bingo, some colors!

We had a small boring vent up near the top of our front garage. We looked around and found some nice cedar ones. I wanted something with curves since the house is such a little rectangular box. We bought this through Home Depot after not being able to find a used one. Dave did a great job installing it today. It just needs some sealing then paint. We're leaning towards sage green for the color? Anyway, it's a nice touch to an otherwise boring area. I had a copper star there so that will get moved to another part of the front of the house.And buds, lots of buds!!!  New peach tree has lots of buds!Pear buds!Ornamental cherry tooApple tree is budding, but now flowers yet.

And lots of chocolate in there too, more than others I've bought from a bakery. For those of us who don't make then from scratch it's a great alternative.big and puffy!JFK's Speech To The Press-I was a child when JFK was assassinated. At the time I didn't really understand who he was, with all of his incredible gifts, and sad personal choices. I heard this a year or two ago and decided to post it here. This riveting speech was given before the American Newspaper Publishers Association on April 27, 1961. It's also on YouTube if you'd rather here it in his voice. I can't think of any politician who would support this now-“Ladies and gentlemen. The very word “secrecy” is repugnant in a free and open society. And we are as a people, inherently and historically, opposed to secret societies, to secret oaths, and to secret proceedings. We decided long ago, that the dangers of excessive and unwarranted concealment of pertinent facts far outweigh the dangers which are cited to justify it.Even today, there is little value in opposing the thread of a closed society by imitating its arbitrary restrictions. Even today, there is little value in assuring the survival of our nation if our traditions do not survive with it. And there is very grave danger that an announced need for increased security will be seized upon by those anxious to expand its meaning to the very limits of official censorship and concealment.That I do not intend to permit to the extent that it’s in my control. And no official of my administration whether his rank is high or low, civilian or military, should interpret my words here tonight as an excuse to censor the news, to stifle dissent, to cover up our mistakes, or to withhold from the press or the public the facts they deserve to know.For we are opposed around the world by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy that relies primarily on covert means for expanding its sphere of influence, on infiltration instead of invasion, on subversion instead of elections, on intimidation instead of free choice, on guerrillas by night instead of armies by day.It is a system which has conscripted vast human and material resources into the building of a tightly knit highly efficient machine that combines military, diplomatic, intelligence, economic, scientific and political operations. Its preparations are concealed, not published. It’s mistakes are buried, not headlined. Its dissenters are silenced, not praised. No expenditure is questioned, no rumor is printed, no secret is revealed.No President should fear public scrutiny of his program. For from that scrutiny comes understanding, and from that understanding comes support or opposition, and both are necessary. I’m not asking your newspapers to support an administration. But I am asking your help in the tremendous task of informing and alerting the American people. For I have complete confidence in the response and dedication of our citizens whenever they are fully informed.I not only could not stifle controversy among your readers, I welcome it. This administration intends to be candid about its errors. For as a wise man once said, an error doesn’t become a mistake until you refuse to correct it. We intend to accept full responsibility for our errors. And we expect you to point them out when we miss them.Without debate, without criticism, no administration and no country can succeed, and no republic can survive. That is why the Athenian lawmaker, Solon, decreed it a crime for any citizen to shrink from controversy.That is why our press was protected by the First Amendment, the only business in America specifically protected by the Constitution, not primarily to amuse and to entertain, not to emphasis the trivial and the sentimental, not to simply give the public what it wants, but to inform, to arouse, to reflect, to state our dangers and our opportunities, to indicate our crisis and our choices, to lead, mold, educate and sometimes even anger public opinion.This means greater coverage and analysis of international news, for it is no longer far away and foreign, but close at hand and local. It means greater attention to improve the understanding of the news as well as improve transmission. And it means finally that government at all levels must meet its obligation to provide you with the fullest possible information outside the narrowest limits of national security.And so it is to the printing press, to the recorder of man’s deeds, the keeper of his conscience, the courier of his news, that we look for strength and assistance. Confident that with your help, man will be what he was born to be, free and independent.\""},

I thought I'd do a post about how we're set up here to give you a better idea! Feel free to ask any questions you may have.First- our city lot is 5,663 sq. feet or about 1/8th of an acre. We have a pretty standard size front and back yard for this part of town. Our front yard faces south, and the back yard is on the west side of the house. The backyard is completely organic at this point, the front yard about 90%. The backyard veggie garden/chicken run/berry patch area is in the top photo. We have a nice sized, well-thought out coop that is safe, easy to clean, well ventilated and the hens love it. We started off with a small coop and quickly realized it was just too small and way too hard to clean-1st coopCurrent coop Dave and I built, painted to match the trim of the house, 90% or more recycled materials!We get wonderful eggs every day, we use the deep litter method and that litter goes into our yard. It really lightens up the heavy clay soil.  Thank goodness we have a HUGE maple tree in backyard or we'd cook! The chickens love the shade in the heat of summer, since Boise can get into the 100's. We have one 55-gallon rain barrel, and I'd like to add at least one more.The backyard has a small deck we built that's about 10' x 25', with turf in the yard-Ellie enjoying the deck The perimeter beds are planted with herbs, perennials and pollinator attracting plants. Flowers too of course!We built a cold frame in the shade, which is great for cool weather crops, and have bird feeders and birdbaths-From the cold frame, yummy collard greens.Our compost pile with Poesy the neighbor's cat, cause she needs shade too!We downsized and tore out our old, dilapidated shed last spring in the south side yard and are using the space to grow more food!Italian beans growing, shed's gone!The front yard currently has turf, a pear, apple and peach tree (planted last spring). We have 2 edible berry shrubs. We also have tons of perennials and shrubs to attract pollinators in the front, as well as herbs. Sorry these are early spring pictures, in the summer is a blast of color and green!A snapshot of our veggie harvestAnd our lovely eggsOur little homestead is always in progress! We will probably build a small mini-shed on the north side of our house for the wheelbarrow and hoses. They ate up too much room this winter in the garage. That's life! We will use as much recycled materials as we can as usual So I hope that gives you a better idea of what we're working with. There's always more change coming~~~ guaranteed...Annabel Langbein, The Free Range Cook-Life can sometimes have some unexpected gifts. When we ditched satellite TV we suddenly had four PBS channels instead of one!!! SCORE! I found several great new shows I'd never seen before. One of my favorites is Free Range Cook, Simple Pleasures showcasing the talents, recipes and charm of Annabel Langbein, a cook/chef from New Zealand. She really does \"keep it real\", by growing, harvesting, foraging, and preserving her own foods. She has excellent, tasty and healthy recipes. I LOVE a woman who can cook on a propane burner !!! She's great on camera and some of the episodes are filmed in jaw-dropping, gorgeous wild areas of N.Z. Her website has lots of great free recipes and she has cookbooks out. She was just on American TV this week, which sadly I missed. She has a marathon of episodes on Easter weekend coming up, so check her out!"},

I did some googling and decided to do this-I liked the idea of a lime green-ish Hydrangea I saw online and found some at JoAnn's Fabrics for a buck, clearance! I also bought some purple/blue flowers. I used floral foam and some spare Spanish moss. I think I may re-do this with regular green moss at some point so the wire will show better.

Mommy's good girls :)too excited to stand still!!!Winter Garden Survivor!It's so funny how things in the garden work out sometimes. Last summer I bought an Italian Parsley plant at Home Depot. It did great all summer. I mulch everything in the raised bed late in the fall/early winter and don't bother pulling anything out. All winter I kept seeing some green. It's the parsley! Somehow it survived even through weather in the teens. That's one tough Italian!"},

V Day Decor", "date": "Jan 23, 2016", "text": "More Thrifting Scores! Last week I stopped at a thrift store I hadn't been to for a while. I really scored! I had found out I'm moving into a larger space at work soon and was looking for a few things to brighten up the space. Here's my score- my snowman above is actually a tree topper but fits perfectly in the top of my entertainment centerI found this at a local feed store, 80% offperfect for my dining room shelfFor my new office space, a small mettalicy bamboo mirror to reflect some light and a dry erase board for my cubicle wallRemember the plain wire basket a while back?French Country Vintagey Crafts w/Thrifted Goodies-I stumbled on to so many great ideas recently! My taste for decor ranges from Scandinavian/Swedish country to French country. There are so many similarities! I think I have some major Spring Fever! While we haven't had the snow the East is getting we've had more than usual. It was also colder earlier here. Anyway, I found the basket above, just wire and lavender that needed some minor repairs. I had to think about what to do with it for a while. I came up with this- I lined it with spare white burlap, stitched it to the upper edge, put some pebbles in the bottom, filled with floral foam and used leftover sunflowers. Whala! It's now on my shelf, looking down right Spring-ish!To the right of it is the vase I bought recently, topped of with a moss sphere, recycled from another topiary of mineWhat to do with these? Paint them with my new sample of Restore Paint, a thick, pudding-like chalky paint. More later on that...my old bathroom mini soap crate before...now....I got the graphics from Thegraphicsfairy, tons there FREE! Not quite done, but French country!other sideI got this faux planter idea from Confessionsofaplateaddict, same graphic, it's mini orange crate from the grocery store!I found the bird graphic and it was too cute! These aren't quite done either, will finish and distress tomorrowMedium sized crate, for something else funother side, maybe for yarn?I added some more sunflowers to my iron bar above my kitchen windowI recently saw this at Hobby Lobby but I'm not sure if I like this enough to make my ownwhat do you think???Lots Of Eggs Again!Our wonderful girls are laying those delectable eggs again, 3 per day! We were down to 1 or 2 eggs per day most of the winter. Poor Ellie, my Barred Rock, molted during the worst of the cold weather, poor baby. I had 2 very thin Trader Joe's French tarts, both with cheese, veggie and herbs. I decided to top them with eggs, but since they were frozen I poached the eggs separately, then added them at the end with herbs. OMG, talk about great. WOW!!!!!! I will do that again soon!V Day Decor-We took down the last of the winter decor today. I deep cleaned and put some regular decorative things out again, and then some red and Valentine's Day things. I keep it very minimal-looking more like Spring!My fun kitchen windowI just added some red floral things to the mini greenhouse conservatory, all thriftedMore red and fun little birdsARE YOU READY FOR SPRING???"},
{"title": "Deleting/Restoring A Blog, Faux Lavender Wreath & Crafting W/Thrifted Finds, For You Baseball Fans!", "date": "Jan 14, 2016", "text": "Deleting/Restoring A Blog-I can't even begin to tell you how much I hate Google. There are NO words. When you have someone start buying up every smaller company their \"customer service\" (and your privacy) evaporates. It's their nature. Here's the short version with some helpful info in case something happens to your blog!I backed up my blog and theme before I went to delete an old junk email account last weekend. After recreating a new blog, because google closed mine, I also had to choose a new URL, or web address. I chose something similar- \"The\" little homestead in Boise. When you Import your blog it still misses quite a few things- links, photos, etc. so you may want to create a back up word Doc for that. It would save a LOT of time restoring or recreating. You might also document the size of the side bar, etc. if it's not the default. I like mine a bitter narrower. I finally realized I could restore the junk email I deleted and within 1 or 2  minutes my blog reappeared. I disconnected the junk email from it and added my main email. This took me 7 hours!!! And a lot of tears. I did find this fix after I published this- How To Change Blogger Login Email Address  Additional instructions I figured out- send the invite then log out. Log on with the new email, THEN accept then invite. Then log in with the old email and make the change. It worked! Pretty easy. I also deleted the new-recreated blog.When you have blogged for several years, and create a following, it's really sad to lose all that. PROTECT YOURSELF FROM GOOGLE, ETC!!! Backup, or archive your stuff. Lesson learned :(My faux lavender wreathFaux Lavender Wreath & Crafting W/Thrifted Finds-I'm getting some spring fever, with 2 inches of snow forecast tonite! We had an inch this morning. I've been loving Provence French Country colors for a while with their famous blues and yellows. I've always loved sunflowers, and I'm going to plant some BIG ones this summer. I have a tendency to put these kinds of things only in my kitchen dining room, so I'm going to spread them out into the living room and our main bedroom. This summer I'm giving our bedroom a fresh, much-needed coat of paint. I'll go with white or cream and use a lot of these kinds of blue/yellow items to brighten it up! I'm going for a rustic, shabby chic bedroom with pops of color. With blue being my fave color and loving lavender (I grow a lot!) I stumbled on to this fun lavender wreath project. It's easy- no glue, and only took me about 15 minutes. I used these 2 components, a fake lavender \"bush\" and a twig wreath (+wire cutter), total cost about $8.00 with a coupon from Hobby Lobby. I LOVE that place, great prices and very helpful staff. Their lavender is very realistic-Directions here from ConfessionsofaplateaddictI saw this on Joss and Main for $60.00 and laughed! A jar, pebbles and fake sunflowers. I'll be making one. For a LOT less!I saw this too at Confessionsofaplateaddict and loved the tin house look for winter decor. You take paper mache houses and spray paint them with \"hammered paint\", how cool! Also from Hobby Lobby.My thrifted pile of components-Recognize the house? Ready to paint and stash for next winter!My thrifted print I just found, $1.99! Sorry, no no-glare glass :( The blue/yellow vase will hold a topiary ($2.00) and I found a new French butter dish. It was a steal at .99 cents, since they run about $25.00 new. They work great!My fave new ceramic teapot (not kettle), got it from eBay for $8.00 great condition! Reminds me of Swedish country style designs -And Santa's (me) new French tin postcard sign will go up, but where??? Hmmm...I finally re-habbed my real Birch Yule log that I got for about $3.00 with really ugly 70's-style greenery. I stripped it down, left the candle holders as is. It has nice heavy metal feet underneath. I deconstructed a small swag I'd made and re-used it, nice! I may add something else, we'll see...My simple winter goodies are out now, with berries from the garden. Soon sunflowers & lavender crafts and decor will emerge from my pile of thrifted supplies! Stay tuned!For You Baseball Fans!Dave and I are both baseball fans, so when I bought him the new James Taylor CD Before This World (excellent!) for Christmas we were both thrilled! He has a great new baseball song that he took 10 years to write. It's about the 2004 world series game, won by the Red Socks, the 1st win since 1918. It's called Angels Of Fenway, luckily he did a great music video too! Enjoy!!!"},

{"title": "On Surviving Hitting A Deer, In The Dark, at 55 MPH", "date": "Jan 4, 2016", "text": "Mule DeerOn Surviving Hitting A Deer, In The Dark, at 55 MPH-I wanted to share this experience because life is full of lots of very unexpected things. Coming back from a day-long road trip Saturday up to the snowy mountains with 3 of our adult kids (and mini-grand baby) I was driving back in the dark with the 5 of us in our car. I was driving our Subaru Outback. The roads were dry. I was doing about 55 in the dark when I noticed a large mule deer running across the road on my left heading right in front of me. I had nowhere to go. I locked up my brakes and hit my horn, felt a thud and the deer jumped over the concrete barrier off to my right. The other side of the concrete barrier was a drop off of at least 1,000 feet down the side of the cliff. I pulled off the road at a high rate of speed and pulled over. I decided not to get out of the car there with the dark and heavy traffic. I got back on the road and pulled off onto a turnout up a bit. My husband and I checked the car and couldn't find literally a scratch on it, just 1 deer hair in the crack when the plastic joins on the front fender. Not only did the deer not cause any damage to the car, I could have likely rolled the car if I had hit the concrete barriers there. I think it would have ricocheted us back out into ongoing traffic. And I think the deer survived! I think it may have been airborne by the time it was in front of the car. My husband said it was a miracle I didn't roll the car. Amen!!!"},

Starting a new full-time, year-round job with a later shift escalated things, with less down/project time. No more school \"breaks\", but I'm getting used to the way the rest of the world works :)  While I miss my old librarian job this is a new path towards a more positive wok environment, better finances, while I'm servicing patients who need help. There's also lots of room for growth in my organization to move on over time. Anyway, here's a recap of some of our major projects and stuff from this last year, not in any particular order-Re-did our veggie garden fencing, mostly with recycled wood, and added a new gate (for $10.00!), before it was garden stakes/pig panels/chicken wire. We enlarged the veggie bed too and added more stone.Dave installed new gable end vents for the attic, in the process discovering they had been sealed with tar paper previously! Nice looking and much cooler! Dave got the 2 cedar vents for $10. each from the Habitat store, usually they're about $100.00 each! We'll tidy up the caulking before we paint.I made more fermented and pickled foods-We had a bumper crop of our organic Pippin apples, what a delight! Our first in 2 years-In prepping for our house painting this coming spring Dave replaced rotting/worn garage door trim and added a weatherizing bottom garage door strip. It's been noticeably warmer in the garage this winter! Looks much better too!Dave also replaced bad siding on the house- We bought a new fridge, much brighter LED lighting inside, so I can see what we have-I ripped out and replaced our kitchen back splash, added a new sink (finally!), faucet and painted. Bye bye old back splash :)The new, easy DIY back splash made a HUGE difference, makes the whole kitchen brighter!So much fresher and nicer! I also re-painted the living room, entry way and back hall. A fresh coat of paint always lightens and brightens.I also recovered my office chair in the kitchen with heavy navy linen, looks much better-I also re-did the back splash in my master bath-I added more thrifted yard art in the veggie area to break up all that fencing!I moved my daughter's college art welding piece to see it better- Amen!I found tons of thrifted goodies, here are some of my faves- Our heavy new dining table, with a leaf, $80.00-Vintage goodies from a junk store In Idaho City- Fossil leather purse, like-new $3.00 at a storage unit sale  new lamp for our bedroom, $5.00table top greenhousewall candle holder rackI turned this into this...I love it!Preserved food, with outdoor canning-Yummy apple slices, added some this morning in another baked oatmeal dish, this time with almonds and currants-I also froze summer foods, and stayed on top of the pantry closet. We had a great harvest of tomatoes, cukes and peppers. Bought our little greenhouse and I started seeds-Got our first pears and we planted a peach tree in the front yard-Sadly we had to cut down our sick nectarine tree as well.Our 3 girls laid lots of great eggs, tilled the soil, ate bugs and weeds-Lots of fresh eggs!Got another used Subaru Outback recently after ours finally got too old-So that's all the big stuff I can remember, more to come for 2016!!! Stay tuned~~~Raclette Cheesy Dinner-A year or so ago I found this recipe Sunset.com and stashed it. I decided to make it for New Year's Eve dinner and it's great, especially on a very cold, 7 degree winter night! I got the Raclette cheese at Traders Joe's, a nice, soft, mild melting cheese. I made the fingerling potatoes, a really amazing dish by itself! I made a 2nd batch for dinner tonite and added more red peppers, yummy... Next I sat out our tray, my new thrifted one-Then I sat out 3 tea towels, sat the hot cast iron skillet on the table and served the potatoes. We ripped and dipped our bread in the melted cheese, and it was divine! We topped it off with a TJ's tart-It was a great hot meal, and pretty simple actually...7 degrees this morningMy Fave Winter Footwear-We can have some really bitter cold weather here in Boise. After living here my first winter I bought a pair of snow boots. I still use them, but I found a better option for cold winter weather- My Salomon snow clogs, at least 15 years old, water-proof, insulated and big treads, perfect for rain, snow or ice. There are a lot of brands now that sell something similar. I did add a heel cushion, more comfortable for my heels. You can hose them off to clean them!!!For inside, my 15 year-old boiled wool Stegmann clogs, re-soled at a Birkenstock store, warm and toasty inside and easy to take off and switch to snow clogs. They do last forever!When I go out tomorrow morning at 5 degrees to open the coop my feet will be all toasty! I sure do appreciate my warm, snug home to come into! All our extra insulation has paid off!!! I think our hens are enjoying our heat lamp for them too :)Here's a nice little reminder how gorgeous our planet and little slice of the universe is, courtesy Jason Mraz and NASA. I showed this to my students and they all LOVED it! Crank up the music, enlarge it and enjoy!"},

{"title": "Tasty, Simple Holiday Meals, Thrifting Score! More Snow", "date": "Dec 27, 2015", "text": "Swedish meatballsTasty, Simple Holiday Meals-I like to always try new recipes. This year I had to work Christmas Eve, although I got off 2 hours early! Next year I will take off some holiday time as I'm still building up vacation time, and can't use any yet. This year I hosted a Christmas morning brunch buffet and decided to make Amish Style Baked Oatmeal. It was a HUGE hit! It was nice and light thanks to the baking powder. I used our eggs, and  home-canned/home-grown organic apple slices in the bottom, making it extra special! I served it with thick bacon, tangelos, Pannetoni bread, and hot beverages. Everyone had fun and left with a full tummy.Santa's helper (hee hee) got me this on eBay for Christmas. My, she has great taste! It will hang in my kitchen in the spring on my white back splash. Baked oatmeal with a hot orange roll, leftovers the next day :)Last night I made Swedish meatballs with cream sauce, egg noodles and served it with Lingonberry sauce. I used this recipe- Swedish Meatballs. It's pretty simple to make the meatballs, and since you bake them in the oven you can walk away-browning in the ovenWe had a mixed kale salad with it. Later we sat down and watched The Christmas Story, what a hoot! I never realized it was set in the late 1930's, not the 40's. Fascinating to look at the kitchen, clothes, etc.Big Thrifting-We hit the Goodwill store today and really scored! We started off with a really expensive baby backpack, a gift for our expecting kids. We paid $25.00, new these would be atleast $100.00 more!I also bought the French-style lavender basket above, nice workmanship-I found 2 nice work blouses, a hanging cubicle file holder and these- wooden flowers for yard art, newlightweight planting tin, $1.99  Like-new Olive tray/dish, $3.99More Snow-We had more snow on Christmas Eve and it was cold enough for it to stick! We had the first white Christmas it a few years, what a treat! The ski resorts are loving it and it's so pretty. It really makes the holidays decoration outside pop! It's been really COLD, it's 16 right now, at 6:30 p.m. The low is forecast for 6 degrees, Thursday morning. The coop is warm and with our newer house no freezing pipes, and a good furnace. Life is good!"},

{"title": "Keeping the Holidays Simple, More Snow! Thrifting", "date": "Dec 20, 2015", "text": "Keeping the Holidays Simple-This year I'm so glad we had already downsized the holidays with our family. Since I work full time now, year round now, I have less prep time that I used to. Bye bye \"winter break\"! I know some people have huge, local extended families, tons of parties, etc. but we're more low key. Sometimes I think people just don't know how to say \"no, it's too much, thanks anyway\". It gets to be too much stuff to do, more $$$ to spend. It kind of cracks me up when people have \"holiday organizers\", but to each there own. If I had that much to organize I'd re-think my priorities! But that's ME. Running around like crazy is just not our mode. We do a simple gift exchange with our adult kids, and most of us are eating healthier so there's less wheat and sugar. I still bake, just on a much smaller scale! Today I made 2 fresh Cranberry Cornmeal Torte, made with real butter, and a little pure Orange extract. The cornmeal gives it a great little crunch!Our smaller house is easier to decorate and every year I get rid of more decor. I was looking at my tabletops the other day and realized I just had too much clutter. Time to pass some things on! Our tree went up yesterday, and I'm baking a cranberry tart with cornmeal for a Solstice celebration tomorrow night. It's peaceful, reflective and a nice quiet break from our American plastic culture. Next year I will have some vacation built up to have some time off. I'm getting two 3-day weekends back to back, a nice break! I'm hoping to do some furniture painting and I'll post that if I do. Here's a few fun things around the house, some I may, or may not, pass on to my kiddos-Keeping all these!Love our little treeLove my windowMight pass onKeeping the birds and snowmenSanta will go bye bye Our little bedroom tree I made, added the birds and birdhouseAnya dug under the comforter, I think I'll keep her :) From Keep Calm cuz Its SnowingMore Snow!Thankfully we seem to have settled into what seems like a normal winter. While the N.W. has been slammed with a lot of heavy rain, we've also gotten lots of snow in the surrounding hills and mountains. Great news! The ski resorts have really been hurting the last several years, low water in our reservoirs, and ugly brown hills all winter. It's 5 p,m., 38 degrees and just started snowing lightly. It was a nice sunny day today earlier, and then the storm blew in. Dave and I cleaned up the coop a bit yesterday ahead of the storm. We always try to work with the weather. We are having what's being called by a local weather man a \"a train of storms\", one after another. Happy dance!Thrifting-I really scored last week with this gorgeous quilted table runner and a cute Santa wreath (no pics sorry).  I hit the thrift store on a day when all their home wares were 40% off! I got the runner and and a little white Santa wreath for work for a whopping $2.50! There's lots of quilting there and really perfect except for a couple tiny spots-"},

And that's a good        place :)Last yearWinter & Holiday Prep-Sorry for the no-post weekend last weekend! My new job, which I really like, has impacted things in a subtle way. With a later schedule I get home after dark, jump into dinner and the day is mostly over. Ironically my daughter has started working there, as well as the wife of a former co-worker. When I mentioned to a few people that they were hiring, had good pay and great benefits some followed and applied and got hired too! Anyway, I woke up early this morning, 5:45 and finally got up while Dave slept. It's just Anya and I! She seems confused up why I am up so early since Dave's the early bird :) We have another major storm on the way, with a projected 2-3 FEET of snow in the mountains. Thankfully this winter seems to be normalizing, with rain and snow. Our back desk looked like this last weekend after a big rain storm-The girls are enjoying their \"sun room\" and coop in the icky weather. It's snug, dry and lots of room.In the sun room (made from recycled materials) in last last year's snowHere's my girls having a snack break, with some fresh spinach-When they see me coming to the coop and I say \"girls, you want some food?\" they know to run inside! I keep holiday things pretty simple. I laugh a bit when people have these \"organization tips\" for the holidays. Some people just really overdue it IMO. They run around and are exhausted which to me defeats to the whole idea. It should be fun and relaxing, and not about stuff. Maybe we're just a lot less materialistic? For instance I put out my winter decor 1st, then the tree a few weeks later. Lights went up outside last weekend-cell phone, blurry sorryIt looks really festive. A neighbor came by while Dave put things up and said \"my wife always tells me to look at your lights, they're so nice!\" I think she's giving him a hint :) We have house lights, ice skates, snowmen, and snowflakes, we like it. Here's a few shots of some inside holiday kitchen goodies, many thrifted-my Solstice vase with Dave's birthday branch lights he gave me :)My table-top mini greenhouse transformed into a winter wonderland! I used Kosher salt in the base for the snow!My nod to Scandinavian traditions, God Jul!My vintage jars decked out!My fave Chicken Tree!!! Spread it out and it's not so overwhelming. If you stay home full time, or when I had \"winter break\" then I could do more. Working full time you have to pick your priorities. We also don't emphasize gifts and baking. Most of us have cut way back on wheat and sugar, while we do indulge a bit. With our kids grown we do a gift exchange- everyone gets 1 name. It takes the financial burden off our kids (and us) to make or buy gifts for everyone. We really still enjoy our holiday time, it's just less about \"stuff\". I read this the other day on Facebook and LOVE the idea! Simple and easy! Anyway, I decided to make a new dish, for me, for Christmas brunch here, baked oatmeal. I'll use some home canned homegrown apples, my eggs, nuts and sounds delish!From Onceuponachef.comI had some left over Pannetoni bread and turned it into french toast last weekend! Festive and yummy!Amazing Duet-I was channel surfing last week and PBS has had some amazing concerts on. I watched Josh Groban's Stages Live. It had a gorgeous theater, incredible orchestra and songs. Kelly Clarkson came out for a duet. When she sang her first note I almost fell out of my chair. WOW, I had no idea she could sing like that!"},

Good for the forests and skiers! I love the way the sun sparkles on the snow! It puts me in the mood to put away my fall decor this weekend and putting up my winter goodies. It was 11 degrees last night, pretty dang cold! The chickens are in good shape with their heat lamp and snug coop. I also bought a \"flock block\"- Nutrena Scratch Block since one is molting and I thought they could use some extra calories! I put it out in the coop and haven't seen them working on it yet. I put some rolled oats on top to get them started. I laos out out LOTS of wild bird feed as they need some help this time of year. Our heated bird waterer helps too.yummy!Some random snow scenes from our little homestead- From Junkchiccottage.blogspotFrench Country Dishwasher Face Lift-I always love a great DIY project and this is one of my favorites!

We're having our main meal today at my daughters. With 2 sets of in-laws things get rotated very year. Thursday we'll have just 2 over for a nice dinner but with pork roast and cranberries. My roasting turkey breast is coming along nicely, cranberry sauce made, making a kale salad too with grapes and blue cheese to take. I REALLY miss having Friday off the day after Thanksgiving. I'd love to have that long weekend off, but I'll be working. The first time in 20+ years or more. Most businesses close that day, but not mine, oh joy.

I DO NOT like finding out about significant events thru Facebook. Anyway, I'm really excited and thinking about what we'll need to be Grandparents. Luckily, right now, we're down the street 5 minutes. The kids are looking at buying a house at some point soon, since there's a real rental shortage in Boise. They're been married a few years now and will make great parents I'm sure. I think you really get a different perspective on your family history when another generation comes up. Now I'm trying to figure out what we may need for babysitting? Luckily there's some newer inventions since I was a Mom like this, nice, portable and storeable-Graco Pack n PlaySnuggle Nest Infant SleeperOverkill for us, but I love this Ikea layout, good use of space-"},

Cheese on top with some bread, oh yeah! We're expecting some snow tomorrow morning, so it will make for a fast dinner tomorrow night. It simmered in the large crock pot all day, great dinner and made the whole house smell good! I froze half for later in the month.I sill have more left so it will be salsa time in a few days.

New later job hours, new car, lots to do! Last weekend, besides buying a car, we were busy with some gardening projects. With 20's/30's at night this week Dave and I harvested the last of the tomatoes, peppers, squash, herbs and cukes-Tomatoes destined for salsas and soups Dave put up the big lower piece of glass on the coop and we stored the screen. It insulates the coop more, but there's still plenty of ventilation. We also added some plastic on the main entry door. Cuts down on the drafts. I keep a close eye on the temps and smell in there. The \"sun room\" is now also up. The girls LOVE it in cold, snowy or wet weather. We added some pine shavings and a roosting bar since it dried out-We've had a lot of rain lately, much needed. There was 8\" of SNOW in eastern Idaho this week! I'm putting away all my yard tools into the garage and covering my garden workbench with plastic this weekend. It protects the wood and I don't use it anyway in the winter. Dave took my Mazda in for a oil change and we had the \"cabin air filters\" changes. It's been 5 years and we didn't know they were there, and supposed to be replaced, as nothing was in the scheduled maintenance book. They were FILTHY!!!Ew!Better air flow now and it will cut down on the dust as well. When they checked my battery it wasn't in good shape, but was still under warranty. Dave took it in with the chains for the old wagon we never used. We wound up getting a new battery for free and a $40.00 cash refund for the chains! SCORE!!!We had a cold Halloween and it was was pretty mellow with our kids grown up. We only had about 15 kiddos trick or treating, but one was an old student of mine! A little boy (K) said \"Hey I know you!\" when I opened the door. I told him who I was and he was so sweet. I told him to tell everyone I said \"hi!\" Nice surprise.Baking With Duck Eggs-A new work pal was offering up free ducks eggs! Her friend give her tons of them, so I found myself with 12 big beauties! I did some research as I knew they were excellent for baking with some info here How To Use Duck Eggs. They add more rising to any baking recipe. I'm going to try this today- Applesauce cake with duck eggs minus the frosting since duck eggs have a lot more fat. No point in clogging my arteries more! Maybe with some muffins today too :)Winter outside kitty Posey, who I gave a little food to, being eyed by inside empress AnyaNew babyBye Bye Car!-This is our new 2013 (30,000 miles) Subaru Outback we just bought, after we had to retire our old 2001 one. It that had 14 years and 160,000 miles on it. We knew the head gasket was leaking, but then found out oil was getting into the motor and it could seize up at any time. We would have had a dead car and no trade-in value. So we went shopping last Sat. at our local Subaru deal. We had a looked at a Mazda 5, a wagon, since our M3 has been super reliable. Very well rated by Consumer Reports, but it seemed a bit cheaply made, and after seeing the deal on the Outback we were sold. It's taller and wider and a bit more interior room. Much better turning radius too! We heard our old baby is being fixed up by the service department and will be sold to another owner. She'll be recycled!Not our old car but the same modelWe got an excellent deal, we added fog lights (base line model), the dealer added new tires and and an additional key. We got an excellent interest rate, 2%, and some trade-in value. Time well spent and all of our hard work paying down other debts over the years added up to a much high FICO score and a better deal. All in all we're glad we went with the Outback again. Dave's thrilled he gets to drive the new car to work, as he always seemed to wind up with the older one. Since I have a longer commute our Mazda is better for mileage for me. When the snow and ice hits though, I'm stealing her! The only downside is it has the WORST software for setting up the cell phone. Very long and cumbersome. The Mazda was so easy in comparison..."},

It was just outside Boise, and spread really fast.The news is reporting that alcohol may have been involved. GREAT. It was horrendous timing as most of the fire resources were spent or gone. Most of the summer firefighters weren't available and money was already spent in the terrible Soda fire, on of the largest in America. We've had terrible smoke here in Boise the last week, yesterday was \"purple air quality\". Really bad, think China :( Some people at work wearing dust masks inside the last 2 days, as we were all really congested, stuffy, and hacking. Several people went home Monday, while I was training in another building. Glad I missed that, as mine had better air filtration. I have asthma so I really feel for people with respiratory issues worse than mine. Good news- major rain is on the way! The fire is 60% contained, and about 8 square miles. Cooler this next week too. I postponed any major yard work with the smoke, but Dave got some done yesterday on his \"vacation\" day.Fire just above the foothills, Boise belowLessons Learned From My Tomatoes-I've typically planted 2 long rows of tomatoes side by side, east to west. This year I really realized that was a BIG mistake. The ones in the back of the row didn't get as much sun as usual. Next year I will go to single rows, more spread out. Dave and I ripped out the monster yellow cherry tomato plant today, to get more sun in there, before the cold weather. We've had a nice supply so far, and I loved the heart-shaped one I picked 2 days ago above :)After Dave and I harvested the yellow babies, yanked it up, and I trimmed the rest back, you can see some room!Headed for salsa!more roomand more tomatoes!Yes, it's raining!!!

She likes to look out, and sleep, by the dining room sliding glass doors. The bed floor is much thicker and the sides taller. Nice and cozy in cold weather. She using it already! Her old one was gray and much cheaper/thinner- Not adequate for an Empress! So I think she's set...My Local Dinners-Ah there's nothing like my own eggs as French-Baked eggs for dinner, with my fresh herbs!

Gorgeous and clear blue skies. Days much shorter, nights cooler and leaves falling. So here's a recent run down...1. Plant Something- Done for the year.2. Harvest Something- Veggies, herbs and tons of eggs! I'll make a bread pudding soon.3. Preserve/Store Something- Filtered out my homemade, homegrown organic apple vinegar. Smells great!4. Manage Reserves- Get a GoodDeal/Barter/Stock Up/Prep- Froze some more peanut power bars I got at the grocery outlet, whole grain rolls, cheeses, restocked canned goods. Got rid of my icky used plastic bags for lunches for work and bought this, a lot nicer and functional!$7.99 at Target, insulated and washable5. Eat the Food- Try NewFoods/Recipe- Still eating garden veggies. Made a new pre-packaged (Christmas gift) veggie pasta soup. I made it tonite, with added chopped ham, was excellent with a little Asiago cheese on top. 6. Build Community Food Systems- I may see if someone at work wants to buy eggs soon. I'm giving them to my kids for now. Bought some local corn stalks and pumpkins from a local veggie stand.7. Recycle/Re-Use- Got rid of some clothes for donations, bought a like-new shirt off eBay. Took some of my old personal desk things from my old job to my new one. I'm in the process of decorating my cubicle. More on that later:) We can do Halloween decor, oh fun! I always missed that at school, a big no-no. Giving the hens lots of leftover fruits, veggies and dry bread. 8. Skill Up- Learning all about my new job! Who knew insurance could be so exciting :) Also going to a benefits orientation tomorrow, lots of cool programs. Saving lots on my new benefits! I get free \"life flight\" on a chopper if I get into a sticky situation in the middle of nowhere. Could be handy!9. Regenerate What is Lost/SalvageSomething- Spread lots of compost recently onto our new veggie area. It's breaking down nicely. The soil was really dead.

{"title": "More Veggies, New Job", "date": "Oct 4, 2015", "text": "More Veggies-This is the time of year we get a good supply of veggies from the garden. Tomatoes, several peppers, squash, lemon cukes, herbs. I made the pizza above with bell peppers, gypsy peppers and 4 kinds of tomatoes. The dough is from a local pizza place. No sauce, just a little EVOO, cheese and herbs. That was a good one! I made some fresh salsa yesterday, with cilantro, red onion, tomatoes and salsa peppers. Great on top of open faced tostadas! I'm going out today to cut the non-producing vines way back, to get more sun to the existing tomatoes. It's been in the 70's, with 40 at night, days are getting much shorter. I like to speed up the ripening as I'm able to. High 70's next week. Leave are changing! We had a big rain storm a couple night ago, so everything is just SO GREEN! Girls still laying 3 eggs per day. We'll clean the coop next month for the winter. I hope we get some serious snow in the mountains, as we had a terrible fire season this year :(New Job-I love my new job. I wanted to start with that. I have shifted out of a elementary librarian job after 10 years, which I loved, into a large hospital/medical corporation. It was a very strategic move for me. There was also a lot of \"luck\" involved, but I believe we also make our own. I applied twice a week for  about 6 weeks, into a few targeted positions. Hired! I thought a lot about what to post here, about WHY I resigned. I guess it just came down to I wasn't happy. I felt marginalized (just extra help here!), ignored and not listened to. When schools are allowed to shut down their libraries once a week, especially in a high poverty school, I'm done. I'm very proud of the work I did there- getting kids excited to read, supporting all the staff, and bringing in about $40,000 in grants. Yeah DonorsChoose.org! I went from a very hostile, negative work environment to a really positive, relaxed one. Sadly a principal can make, or break, a school. While many of the staff were very supportive of me they knew not to argue with admin. School politics sadly. I haven't seen that where I am now. I was also working in a very old building, in need of a major remodel/rebuild, very dusty and dirty. Schools are also at the mercy of their districts, and districts at the mercy of the legislature. That can make for a uneasiness when looking at your potential future job security. The medical field is always growing, a good business to be in.Where I am now everyone helps each other, the playing field seems level. I am doing customer service in rehab for patients, getting them the help they need. My team is small, about 8 people, really friendly and funny. Jokes galore during the day. It about quality, not quantity, and so there's not a big emphasis on sheer speed. Works for me! Much better organization, amazing benefits, and working year round now will boost my income a lot. It's a win win win situation, happy dance! I'm also in a much newer building, much better for my allergies :) Very dust free, huge windows, short commute, free hot beverages, nice cafeteria. It's just like night and day. So, that's the scoop! I look forward to going to work now. Still in the training phase, but it's all making sense. I good with tech, so it's a good fit and easy transition! There's room for growth, lots of support for employees and a supportive environment."},

I love the size and color-I thought about selling them but I LOVE the pattern! I bought 6 mugs, the next day went back and got the same pattern bowls, 6 of them-Nice big vase, 50 centsWhile these clothes hampers were not thrifted I did get these for $10.00 each in the dorm section at Target. I had been looking all over for new hampers, and didn't want to spend $30.00- $40.00 EACH. It's nice with a separate liner that pulls out. Sometimes you can find great deals in that off-to-college area, in the fall. I hit the Grocery Outlet on the way home last night, found a really nice glass commuter cup, and these Power Bars- 1 BOX for $5.00, for 15 bars! That's 33 cents per bar! I may buy more and freeze them for emergency use.More DIY Home Improvements-We're still finishing up various projects outside. Dave and I decided to jazz up our front entry way post. After much research Dave wrapped our boring front 4\" x 4\" with finish grade cedar in sizes ranging from 1\" x 2\" to 1\"x 8\". We like it!!! I'll coat with some clear stain poly for weather protection.In house prep for spring painting Dave removed some cracked and rotting (bottom) of the 2\" x 6\"s on the sides of the garage doors. He bought some Royal Mouldings Vinyl Jambs and other other components. He saw these on This Old House and said it was the same price as new wood, but will last forever. Once it's painted it will look great! Easy install and more insulation for the garage door edges.

These are SO GOOD!!!! I make these every winter, but they'd be good in the fall too. I LOVE the combination of the orange, raisins and almond.These cookies hail from Germany and were traditionally sweetened with honey, but that has now been substituted with molasses. They have all the spice of a gingersnap and a texture that’s tender and chewy.1 cup almonds1 cup packed light brown sugar1/4 cup honey1/4 cup unsulfured molasses1 large eggFinely grated zest of 1 orange1/2 cup dark raisins1 3/4 cups flour1/2 teaspoon baking soda1/2 teaspoon cinnamon1/4 teaspoon nutmeg1/4 teaspoon ground cloves1/4 teaspoon saltConfectioners’ sugar, Toast the almonds in a medium-size nonstick skillet over medium-high heat for 6 minutes and set them aside.With an electric mixer set on medium speed, beat together the brown sugar, honey, molasses, egg, and orange zest in a mixing bowl until smooth.Combine the almonds & raisins in a food processor. Pulse repeatedly to finely chop the mixture. (You can also finely chop the ingredients by hand.) Stir the nut mixture into the sugar mixture. Sift the flour, baking soda, spices, and salt into a separate medium-size bowl. Then stir the dry mixture into the liquid a third at a time, stirring well after each addition. The dough will be quite dense and sticky.Scrape the dough onto a well-floured 3-foot-long sheet of plastic wrap. Generously flour the dough. Then, using floured hands, knead the dough several times to smooth it. Flatten the dough into a 1-inch-thick square and wrap it in the plastic. Slide the dough into a plastic bag or wrap it in aluminum foil and chill it until firm, several hours or overnight.Heat the oven to 350 degrees. Line a baking sheet (preferably not a dark one) with parchment or lightly greased aluminum foil. Set the sheet aside. Transfer the dough to a generously floured sheet of waxed paper and roll it into a 1/4-inch-thick rectangle or square. Cut the dough into cookies that measure about 2 inches square, or a round biscuit cutter.Transfer the squares to the baking sheet, spacing them about an inch apart. Bake the cookies on the center oven rack for 12 to 13 minutes, 1 sheet at a time. When done, the cookies will have formed a crust, but they should still feel soft to the touch. (Tip: The cookies stay chewier if you bake them less and put them in an airtight container while they’re still slightly warm. If your family prefers a crisper cookie, just bake them a little longer and let them cool completely before you store them.) Transfer the cookies to a wire rack and, while they are still quite warm, dredge them in confectioners’ sugar. Makes about 18 to 24 cookies.Enjoy!!!"},

I do things throughout the year, like working on filling up my freezer over the last 2 months. I checked our emergency lighting last month- kerosene (heating too), propane, and batteries. I found this brilliant idea for lighting today, which I LOVE!!!The Luminaid Solar Light  $24.95, fold flat to 3\" x 5\"I always think about heating, food, fuel, transportation, prescription meds, OTC meds, appropriate cold weather gear if we had to bug out even locally. When it's 10 degrees you won't be wearing flip flops!!! Then there are thinks like books, card games (keeps you occupied), candy, coffees, teas. Here's how I did some prepping in the last few days- I bought 2 packages of chicken thighs, $3.00 each and 3 lbs. of bacon-I re-wrapped the chicken, double bagged it and got out as much air as possible. When I do it this way I have zero% freezer burn. Split the bacon, froze half. I always use new bags and toss after opened. Off to the freezer they went.Dave picked the last of the Pippin apples yesterday, one more 1/2 laundry basket full. That's it for this year-cooking for applesauceI must say LOVE my Roma canning food processor!  You can leave on the apple skins, seeds and it filters it all out. I run the pulp thru a 2nd time and you'd be surprised how much more puree you get out! For the apple butter I used a medium strainer for the silky smooth texture. Tastes great!applebutter cooking downSince I did 25 Qts. of apple slices already I did a small batch of apple butter and the rest is applesauce, spiced & regular. I make mine on the chunky side with a big strainer screen and ended with 13 Qts. total. It was a nice day to can outside, about 70 degrees! I use Ball's applesauce recipe and I tried this for the apple butter Canningacrossamerica.com  I subbed 1 cup of brown sugar for white, as I saw that somewhere. I just put in the crock pot and walked away:) Sadly I only wound up with 3 1/2 pint jars. Next time I will use my own applesauce as a base, so I'll know how much I'll have. I wanted about 6 jars. I may make some today with my own applesauce. My time canning yesterday was about 6 hours, but worth it! I also took some breaks as my back was talking to me leaning over the sink that long cutting off wormy parts :) I saved the perfect ones in the fridge for eating. As Dave bit into one crunchy delicious apple I said \"Isn't that satisfying since we grew it ourselves!\" Amen. I think fruit trees are really such a great source of food, and certainly cost efficient!Happy Labor Day!Since I was basically canned all day yesterday, and Dave painted the new replacement siding all day, we are \"resting\" today.

I also have some small propane cans for my  Mr. Heater heater. I always tend to worry about winter heating since we don't have a wood stove YET :)  I'm still working on Dave! I just saw the smaller version, the Little Buddy-Nice for a smaller spaceAnd now for APPLES!!!- Fruit trees seem to be one of the highest producers of food for the investment. BUT you never know how the weather, etc. will affect them. Great harvest this year! They are organic, and have some wormy spots. I just trim that off. I made my first monster cobbler 2 days ago-Love the color, they're PippinsReady for crumble topping!bucket #1 ready for slicingPerfect ones for just plain eating!Kitchen set up, boiling water and syrupToday I canned 26 Qts. of light syrup apple slices! I use the Ball Blue Book mostly, works great.  It was only in the low 80's today so not bad outside. I can outside with a steam canner, on a camping cook stove, works great for what I do. I won't can on my glass top stove. I hope to have gas someday. I can do 6 Qts. at a time on my set up-Cooling on the tableI go back and forth between the kitchen and the deck, a short trip. I used about 1/3 of what's on the tree today. The rest aren't quite ripe, so will wait for the next 2 weekends. I'll make more slices and applesauce! Loving what I did today! This new tool came in handy-An 8' picker, $18.00I'm glad we made the investment of our canning rack this spring. I had a sense we'd need it-More jars coming!First ones in!Last of my jars, I may need more! I ran out of lids too :)My very first apple vinegar brewing away!What's great about prepping is it saves you money in the long haul, even if there is no crisis.

Last spring, 2014, we had it professionally pruned, and had zero apples. Not a surprise. This year we have a BUMPER crop!Branches bending low with fruitIt's also an early harvest, with the mild wet spring/early summer. Good for me as I go back to work next week! It's been really hot the last few days, and really windy. Apples are on the ground but I can fix that :) Dave will be picking the next few evenings on the orchard ladder, a gift from his previous boss. He was going to throw it away!!! Anyway, since we don't spray the apples have worms holes, but I cut around those and the chickens get the rest. They love the fruit! This week I'll be....Canning apple slices in a light syrup, faster than sauce! Good for winter dishes like pork chops, cobblers.Making chunky apple sauce, plain and spiced (think apple pie filling), great with anything!Making apple butter, make it from the apple sauce in a crock pot.

What to do? I had been thinking about making a living room topiary and then had a \"Eureka\" moment! Why not a flour sifter topiary? I had some left over dry floral foam, moss and a hot glue gun. I bought a round foam sphere, more moss and one wood dowel, all about $12.00. I added some rocks in the bottom of the sifter for stability, the foam next, then topped with moss. I hot glued on the moss to the ball, let cool.My funky vintage pan is now my hot glue tray :)I pressed the ball onto the dowel and glued some twigs from the yard on top of the dowel.Now it's done! I like it :)\"Before\" Picture Crafts, misc. decorative things Organizing Craft Supplies- I tackled all my various craft supply things, eBay/Craigslist/donation items this summer, since they were scattered around the house.

After moving college kids in and out, and all the dings/scrapes it was needed. We waited til we saw a 4th of July sale on paint, $10.00 off per gallon. We bought 2 , but needed 3, oh well. Since we decided to go a bit lighter than the current color I bought this, Behr's Golden Nectar. New paint it really is very cheap way to really jazz up your home with some new energy!!! I was going to go with Benjamin Moore paint til I priced it, yikes! Back to Behr, and $10.00 rebates...Old paint color, B. Moore StrawIt's kind of a cross between yellow and gold/orange.

I have a teal one and a gray/brown one. My pal told me all about hummingbirds after I saw hers. I bought a couple feeders and change the food every 3-4 days. They come all day, off and on, and are very territorial! Little cutie pies :) I love watching them hang out in the trees and sometimes groom themselves. Safe Coop Cleanup-With all the various things out there- the Hanta virus, Avian flu, and a bit locally The Plague, yes THE PLAGUE, Dave really suited up. We use the wonderful deep litter method, which uses 4\"-5\" of pine shavings. Composts, no odor, very clean. Dave cleans it out 4 times a year and it's good to protect yourself. Dave created his own Hazmat suit! Afterwards, he showered and I washed it all. Works great! Dave even found 2 dead snakes in the coop! Cool :)  Now our new bean bed is much more mulched, since it was a dead area under the shed. Looking good!My 3 surviving Italian Bush bean plants"},
{"title": "How to Protect Your Roof & Keep Your Home Cooler & Dryer, Recovering An Office/Computer Chair", "date": "Aug 1, 2015", "text": "How to Protect Your Roof, & Keep Your Home Cooler & Dryer-Last month I had a feeling that our attic power fan wasn't working, again. Don't ask me why! It vents out the hot air and moisture in the summer. I was right and after Dave called the manufacturer, Broan, the tech support person told Dave way too many home don't have enough ventilation. Many sadly either cover their passive roof or gable vents thinking they're letting cold air in in the winter, but forgetting about letting the attic breathe and letting HOT air out. Dave took a look at our 2 attic gable vents and realized they were probably quite a bit too small. There are several free website calculators that will let you figure out how many square feet of ventilation you need per the size of your attic. He found a great deal on 2 brand-new ALL Cedar gable vents for $10.00 at the Habitat Store. Usually they are about $100. EACH or more :)  What a deal!!! Anyway, upon removing the old vents he found they had been sealed inside with tar paper, during the construction-Vent completely covered with tar paper under the siding!!!Dave said he's heard of siders getting mad at the roofers so they cover up vents. Talk about stupid!Gee, no wonder we burned out 3 attic fans! It was a vacuum with no air movement and running 24/7 in the heat. This can cause roof curling if not fixed as well as moisture issues. The roof curling can happen from excessive HEAT when you don't have enough ventilation so it has somewhere to go. No on WANTS to put on a new roof when it can be prevented. If you live in the high desert, like we do, the moisture isn't quite so critical. So, Dave put in a new motor, 2 gable vents (with some help from me!) and we are happy there's no roof damage. Sadly Dave got about 8 yellow jacket stings, as there was a nest under part of the siding!!! Yikes, lots of ice and Cortaid later, he survived. I gave him Benadryl at bedtime, since he wanted to finish the job and not be drowsy. He caulked and since it's weather-proof we're leaving it until next year when we paint the house. I have since got an Epi Pen just in case!!! Dave said a HUGE amount of hot air came pouring out when he opened it up!!! The site of the nasty yellow jacket nest!!! :(Several websites said you can NEVER have too much ventilation. Since heat rises, even in the winter, along with moisture, it needs somewhere to go. We've also noticed our attic fan isn't running as often, even on today's 100 temps, so that will save $$$. It's good to check and make sure your vents aren't covered as ours were! Lesson learned :) Thanks Dave for your help with the wording!All done!Recovering An Office/Computer Chair-After I recently updated our kitchen I was looking at my ugly computer chair, which stuck out like a sore thumb-EwI had seen a lot of how-to Pinterest ideas on how to cover these. I had some leftover navy blue (pics are lighter) linen upholstery-weight fabric so I decided to cover it! I wanted it to look fitted, nice and tailored. I basically pinned it to fit and cut, no pattern required-First fitting, fabric inside outI had to leave a vent for the knob too1st test fitting, too loose...2nd fitting looking better!Dave took the back and arms off for me, and I stapled down the fabric. I had to remove the black mesh cover first underneath, easy with an Exacto knife. I did have to have a seam on the seat, which I double stitched.test run, fabric stuffed under the top pieceknob exposedBack looking good!The top was the toughest part, with the curved top, took 3 tries. I also decided to whip stitch by hand the bottom of the top section. Much more fitted! I LOVE it! And ZERO cost for me, took about 3 hours total..."},

Soak up some sun, the lakes and green. Our prep went well, we left rested Wed. morning about 9 a.m. I drove out of town, light traffic, clear, easy going. About 40 miles or so out of town, on the 4 lane interstate, doing about 80 (the speed limit), Dave and I both noticed simultaneously the cars ahead had their brake lights on, and then that they were STOPPED. As I started locking up my brakes I saw a horse very calmly crossing the interstate median thru the cars. Then I saw the other 3 horses! Oh my, I'm thinking, as I'm looking ahead- \"will I hit the car ahead of me, should I go right into that lane, where's the most room, or onto the median where I will probably roll the car???\" Hmmm... what to do? I just kept the brakes locked and didn't hit anyone! I also didn't pee my pants :) I called the state police and they were already on the way. A big fine for the owners I bet, and all the troopers to come out. Very scary...The rest of the trip was great! I even hit my favorite animal shelter thrift store Mcpaws Thrift Store, twice! We went up to the top of Brundage Mountain on the chair lift, so fun! Hiked around for an hour or more on the top, about 7,000 feet. Gorgeous views. We also went to little Payette Lake, more remote, and much quieter. Fun trip, and all we could afford with a lot of home improvement lately.

Later he decided to use it to replace our old garden/chicken run fencing with the recycled lumber. The gate was falling apart and the ugly posts were just, ugly!

Before pictures-Old fencing- hog panels, chicken wires and garden posts, empty back fencing :(old gate, falling apart and posts rotting1st section done!

It was a LOT of bare fencing from my living room! More Thrifting!I found some fun things right before, and during our road trip. The above is- a .99 cent Ikea frame still in plastic, a $1.50 creamer set, 2 grain sack-style shams that I will modify for our couch pillow, and a French style plant stand. Dave cut some new scrap wood for the bottom of the pot stand, I'll paint the done! Got a nice blue ceramic pot, and a wonderful Patagonia messenger bag (off to eBay) for $4.00! Later I discovered inside there was the cute blue and yellow Vera Bradley wristlet bag. Didn't see that when I bought it! I think someone forgot to check the pockets!

I put the chickens in early as they were getting soaked, and it filled my empty 55 gallon rain barrel in an hour or less.

{"title": "Kitchen Makeover Prep, Old Family Quilts, Romantic Prairie Style, After Paint Job", "date": "Jun 22, 2015", "text": "Kitchen Makeover Prep-Now that my little bathroom mini-makeover is done, onto the kitchen! It really needs a fresh coat of paint, after 10+ years! I went with a slightly whiter yellow, this \"yogurt\" from Behr-It's a soft, buttery yellow, but with some undertones. It's more yellow on the paint chip than on the screen. Anyway, I'm taking off the old back splash tomorrow, then putting up the new back splash. Happy dance! Next week we'll have a plumber install the NEW sink, faucet and water filter, then I'll paint. Since we have the plumber coming to replace our very leaky exterior hose spigot (inside the wall) we'll have him do this too. Remove the HEAVY cast iron sink and install the new one. While Dave can do it, it's tough on the old back :) Both the old sink (bought used 10 years ago at Habitat) and faucet are on their way out. I can't keep the sink clean and finally got a new one, a Kohler, Brookfield, white, made in the USA with 80% recycled materials! Since our faucet was 10 years old we decided to replace it too, and this was much cheaper than replacing the big faucet we had, and I like the look better. It's a Moen (Dave knows plumbing brands!) a \"Walden\", tall but not huge-Overall we're happy with the re-do, on a budget, since we're not doing the counter. We'll live with it. I've also deep cleaned my desk, on the end of the kitchen counter, and the desk drawers there. Here's the nice work I did. First I cleared off my desktop-I also cleaned out all the old software, boxes and misc. junk out of my 3 desk drawers. I took my cookbooks off the desk top, out of the crate gave them a new home-New home, desk drawer, easy to get to. The rest are on my bookcaseMore cell phone stuff, papers, junk, time to purge!All better! I can see what I have now, the rest is stored with like-wise itemsOld Family Quilts-Empress Anya loves to sleep in her bedroom during the day, when it's hot out. While we have AC it's cooler and she can hear the birds outside the window-I was looking at my Grandma Marshall's quilts she made in that bedroom. I never knew her, but I love her design style and the colors she used! I can just see her on a snowy Nebraska night sewing away! I'm sure some of these were made from flour sacks-Romantic Prairie Style-My new FAVORITE BLOG is Cottage Of Vinnord. She has the best design style, I love it! She mentioned this book, Romantic Prairie Style so I checked it out at my library. It has some great ideas! While I am INCREDIBLY BORED with the all-white rooms, roses and burlap EVERYWHERE-look I do like the vintage twists. I think the whole chippy paint, fake shabby chic thing is on it's way out, but that's OK. I have loved old things my whole life and some of this fits me. Since I love Scandinavian & French country, with American vintage thrown in, it's a nice visual treat. Read all about it if you like! Here's a few of my fave shots-Love the lemon yellow and blue! I would never have thought to paint the back of a cabinet a dark color, brilliant! This shot inspired me to make a lemon topiary, more later on that :) More yellow, how cheery! Similar to my old kitchen color but more intense, lemonyLove the blue and the mirror, wish I had a double window!Nice idea with the hooks and jars with flowers\"After\"After Paint Job-I bought this nice print about 15 years ago, and the blue wood stain was all faded-The \"before\"I bought a can of satin spray paint and tried to match the blue in the print, and did a pretty good job! Really makes the blue in the print pop, a good $4.00 fix!!! Ironically it's probably a \"French country\" print but I didn't know that at the time. I just liked it!"},
{"title": "Frugal Mini Bathroom Makeover, Refreshing Picture Frames, Summer Stuff, Thrifting Score", "date": "Jun 18, 2015", "text": "The \"before\"counterFrugal Mini-Bathroom Makeover-I just finished a mini-bathroom makeover for our small bathroom! I added a new back splash. Our master bath is actually a 1/2 bath. The main bathroom is down the hall and we remodeled it last year. Sadly my bathroom (hubby Dave uses the big one) was pretty sad looking in comparison. The main thing I HATED about the counter (as in the kitchen) was the back splash, with the icky metal trim. It's really bad in the kitchen, a great place for food to get stuck in. While I'm not a fan of beige laminate, I can live with it a few more years until we get a solid counter. Or until it dies. I still like the paint color, a very white blue, keeping with my faded, beachy theme. I was super careful removing the back splash so I didn't need to re-paint. Glory be!!! I also add a few new or recycled accessories and I'm done! Well, maybe some new towels :) I first added new knobs on the cabinet, which remind me of sea glass -Hobby Lobby, $4.99!I spent a full month researching what I could do for a new back splash, that would be fast, low cost and durable. I looked at tile, wood, stone, glass, you name it. Here's what I came up with, a good compromise for now- \"Nexus Tiles Wedge Blue\" from Home Depot-                                                                                             First I removed the old back splash, easy! Just peeled off gently with a wide spackle toolThen I spackled to even things out, let dryI did the full install today, wiped down the counter. I also caulked the bottom edge. I used optional construction adhesive to really lock them into place-Love it!Elephant hanger is gone, off to donationAll dressed up!My fave vintage jar full of seashellsAnother vintage jarMy print from the old bathroom now where I can see it!New clock from Home Depot, $7.00!The total for the whole job was about $50.00, not bad! The kitchen is next, with a different back splash and full paint job :)Thrifted Prim Mirror- beforeRe-Painting Frames-I noticed a while back I had some nice frames that needed a spruce up/upgrade, the one above and this-The sunflower print is is in really great shape but the blue stain is very faded. Time for some paint! Here's the process for the prim birdhouse mirror, which didn't go with anything else color-wise-Used free postits to cover the mirror and \"roof\", removed moss from hole New paint, just need to put the moss back in the holeI'll do the sunflower frame next and then a few more projects. Here's the colors I'm using, a range of blues-Free Printable Seashell Print!!!Summer Stuff-I found this FREE, gorgeous 16\" x 20\" shell poster on the link above. I had it printed for $7.00 and found a thrifted frame for $4.00. What a deal! I was going to paint the frame but the pale blue, distressed finish grew on me :) Perfect bit of beachy summer in the living room!Great detail in the posterMore summer stuff, I made the chunky prim flag :)My \"sea table\", reminds me of the Oregon coast, and mostly thrifted!Posie hanging out in the cool raised bed :)Thrifting Score-I got the 2 above items, new, at Goodwill for $1.99 each! Perfect for my kitchen after I put my new white back splash in. I also got the teal clock shown above from Home Depot, $7.00. It was a good day :) I also bought 2 of these on eBay-It's a standard size galvanized lid and soap/lotion pump for canning jars. I'll put one in my bathroom and one in the kitchen after I re-paint. I know where I can find some blue/green vintage jars for them hopefully. I'll use clear glass for now. At $4.99 each they were cheaper than trying to make my own. They had LOTS of finishes, but I liked these eBay.com!"},

My mini greenhouse worked great this year!Peach tree is doing well too-Beans ready to plant tomorrow. Too hot last Sunday, our planting day. 2. Harvest Something-Kale, kale and more kale!  Collards and chives, and basil soon.Rosemary, thyme, oregano are ready too- 3. Preserve/Store Something-I'll start fermenting more veggies soon, was waiting til school was over. A lot of apples are turning colors already! 4. Manage Reserves- Get a GoodDeal/Barter/Stock Up/Prep- We bought a nice $45.00 fence panel for $10.00 to use as a garden gate. Our is falling apart, so we spotted this (a special order return, missing parts) and will use instead. I'll paint it a dark green. We'll add it to the new garden gate post soon and will be all set!5. Eat the Food- Try NewFoods/Recipe-Using up lots of frozen (buried in the freezer) fish- fish tacos, fish and chips, etc. Will try a new tomato and mint salad recipe like this BBCgoodfood.com when mine are ripe! They'll be early this year with the mild spring/early summer weather. With all of our eggs I'm going to try this soon, since it looks so good!Chilaquiles With Fried Eggs from Realsimple.com 6. Build Community Food Systems- Done selling eggs for now, will go to the kids, and more egg dishes for us (see above). Will hit a farmer's market later in the summer. They're not very good here so far, as far as my experience goes. Pretty inconsistent.7. Recycle/Re-Use-Got some used, FREE shower doors to replace some wood in our chicken \"sun room\" from Second Chance-The store supports local sobriety programs. We found some used shower doors for sale, then the clerk said the other ones were free. Works for us!Since we tore down our shed we have a lot of good lumber left over. Dave wants to replace our green metal stakes in our garden fencing with posts and add some 2 x 4's. It will look much better and be more sturdy. The rest will be donated. We also gave away a ton of leftover shed materials on Craigslist for free. Donated clothing yesterday, with more on the way. New fence posts soon!8. Skill Up-I just learned how to remove a laminate back splash with thin metal edging. Easy, just use a putty knife and a hammer. Comes off nicely! New back splash coming soon!!! 9. Regenerate What is Lost/SalvageSomething-Regenerating the soil under the old shed, added lots of compost! Beans go in tomorrow.Colors At The Little Homestead-With all the monsoon type patterns lately, warm and rain late in the day, everything has gone crazy blooming! Here's a peek-Greek Festival- Opa!Every year we go to the local Greek Boisegreekfestival.com which benefits the Sts. Constantine & Helen Greek Orthodox Church. They have live music, dancing (missed that), and tons of very affordable, authentic foods. It's always fun and we needed a break last Sat. Weather was nice and had a great time!

{"title": "How To Add A Fruit Tree To Your Existing Landscaping, The Shed is Gone! Setting up A Tea/Coffee Drawer, Upcycled Metal Bin", "date": "May 24, 2015", "text": "How To Add A Fruit Tree To Your Existing Landscaping-Recently we realized we need to remove our nectarine tree sadly. Between the irrigation people massacreing it with their equipment, and getting too big for it's spot, it's time to go. The only reason I ever planted a nectarine tree was that I could not find a peach tree in the entire valley at the time. This time I was finally able to find the perfect little PEACH tree, a Red Haven. It's-A blue-ribbon, all-purpose peach. Luscious, top-quality fruit is great as a fresh snack or for canning and freezing. Enjoy bushels of large peaches with almost fuzz less skin over firm, creamy textured yellow flesh. Tree is heavy-bearing and easy to grow and maintain. Blooms late to avoid spring frosts. Branches have a spreading nature. Originates from South Haven, Michigan in 1930, introduced in 1940. Disease-resistant to leaf spot. Freestone. Ripens in late July. Self-pollinating. Info from Starkbros.com It will ripen early a big bonus for me. If I can process the fruit before school starts that will really help.Here's s few things to consider BEFORE you plant if you're adding a tree to an existing landscaped area-*What's the exposure? We needed full sun so we had to find a good spot that was well exposed.*Do you want shade in that area? Our tree will add some shade to our hot, southern entry way, that's good!*How big will the tree get and can you prune it easily from there? We wanted ours in the front yard but not too close to the street or driveway.*When will your fruit ripen? Depends on the tree.*Will your tree have room and not touch the exterior of a building? Never plant a tree too close to your home or other out buildings.*Can you water it easily? Trees need regular watering to thrive.*What's the soil quality, do you need to amend it? We have heavy clay soil so that's an issue.* Do you mind have falling fruit on the ground? If so, think again.*Do you need a full size tree or would a dwarf work better? That depends on the space you have and what kind of fruit you want? We went with full size.*Where will you buy your tree? Online, locally, or? We found ours at Home Depot, then I researched the variety and found it was a good fit for us. I LOVE peaches!!!After thinking hard, here's what we did-Pick a spot, measured width for the tree, Anya inspectedset tree out, then Dave pulled the existing brick edging to relocateDave setting up the edgingturf removed, soil turned, then we added compost and manureAll planted, mulched, with a tree stake, and we may even get a couple of peaches this year!The Shed is Gone!Dave demoed the shed yesterday, after he did a major reorganization with the contents. Some went to donations, the kids or the garage. We saved some of the building materials to re-do our garden fence- 2x4's and 4x4 posts, the rest is going to free Craigslist later today.Before shot, a good space at the timeDave knew it was in bad shape, then he stepped and went thru the floor yesterday. Good thing it was a short fall so to speak, and we was wearing boots! It's a long narrow space, but we'll grow something there. I'm thinking a long row of beans :)Setting up A Tea/Coffee Drawer-I realized a while back that I had teas scattered in 3 places in the kitchen and more in the pantry closet. Time to organize. I stumbled onto a Pinterest post about setting up a tea drawer, and eureka! So here's what I did...I looked at my drawers, I figured the one closest to the Keurig and water would work. Many times we use the K machine to just heat water, since we have lots of teas we like. The drawer had lots of towels, and wash cloths in it-too many towels, some now in donation box, rest were moved, teas and coffees outempty drawer to startI filled with my thrifted bamboo dividers, baskets and a box. The Keurig boxes fit perfect! Now I know EXACTLY what we have, and it's easy to find.Anya checking it outI used the 2 level rack and got even more off the counterSome leftover iced tea pods, K cup, sugar and coffee grinderleftover storage went to my daughter :)Upcycled Metal Bin-We found this at a Habitat store a while back, full of nuts and bolts.

Maybe it's a spring thing? I de-clutter various areas each year. I'll be working on my kitchen counter, dining table and small bathroom counter in the next week. My one daughter told me last week that I didn't need to re-do my kitchen back splash since she couldn't see it anyway, I laughed. Exactly, too much stuff! Ditto the kitchen table, with Costco jumbo vitamin bottles, prescription bottles, etc. I ordered one of these since I couldn't find any locally- 6 Section Pill Organizer I have 1 that works great for my p.m. stuff. I'll put everything away for the a.m. stuff and all the bottles will be off the table.I'll also consolidate the teas and coffees into some kind of a tea/coffee drawer like this-Nice idea from Tea Coffee StationLove this, from Hazeleyessue.blogspot love the print Keep Calm and Drink Tea...Dave and I also visited about replacing the current kitchen laminate counter with a solid counter top. After more thinking about it I decided to just do a new back splash, new white sink and keep the counter for now. I don't hate my counter but I do HATE the ugly metal edging, that traps food and icky stuff-Visualize less stuff and nice white back splash!I will be re-painting the kitchen, with 10 years of grunge, chips, dings, etc. We got our current Kohler cast iron sink used at Habitat 10 years ago and it's pretty scratched. We'll save a lot of $$$ this way, it will look much nicer and functional. So it's time! Here's my current back splash idea, after 100's of hours of research online-Flat white from Homedepot.comIt's a PVC ceiling tin look type of material. Not too bad price-wise, durable, easy to install and bright! I think it will go well with the tan counters and yellow paint.My little bathroom laminate counter is in good shape but I hate the metal edging there too, so I'm doing a small glass back splash this summer, something like this-From Houzz.comBye ByeShedding the Shed-We have things in our home, 2-car garage and shed. After storing our kids things during college, most of it is finally gone. That leaves us with the space in the garage to move our shed/house things in to. While I was down with the flu last weekend Dave was emptying out our shed and we'll tear it down next Memorial Day weekend, 3 days off for both of us. We talked a lot about what we really need- camping gear etc,. versus what we don't?  Then we talked about where to put what? The current shed is over 10 years old and rotting in parts. Time to go, since it's too big anyway now.We won't need to build a micro shed like we thought, since we relocated a lot to the garage. In a smaller urban setting lie our we don't need a big shed like some folks might. Later, if we need to, we can build a smaller one.Dave's $2.50 thrift store tool rack, now in the garage!We may use the left over demo materials for some yard art.  It will also allow for more garden space and add to the chicken run area maybe! We may do a straw bale garden there, since the soil is in poor shape. Good place to experiment!Lots of Rain!We've had a lot of much-needed rain, almost 1/2\" just yesterday, in the last week.

I read this- New Warm Phase & Consequences Dramatic? and watched this Pacific Oceans Blob Concerns Scientists Video. Some animals and fish going too far north will really mess with the food chain/web. With continued weather issues & climate change that may really contribute to even more devastating issues like drought, fires and the ability to grow food. Glad I don't live in affected areas, but it may trickle down to the rest of us with food prices, etc....Independence Days-Here's a round up of what we've been up to...1. Plant Something- Starting seeds today in mini greenhouse, as the weather has been really up and down. Today it's 56 and REALLY windy! Supposed to be 85 Tues./Wed.!!! CRAZY! Veggies, herbs and flowers. Planted 4 new thorn less blackberries. Hens picked off some leaves, will move fencing back a bit so they can't reach the plants. Lesson learned.  2. Harvest Something- Eggs and tons of compost. We've been having too much compost with the deep litter method so may start having to give some away, soil level is getting too high.3. Preserve/Store Something- Made brined Meyer lemons. Let the freezer run low for the new fridge switch and defrosting. I will work on filling it up again. Just in time for sales on BBQ meats, like chicken and ribs :)4. Manage Reserves- Get a GoodDeal/Barter/Stock Up/Prep- Got a great deal on some new art for the house, cool weather veggies and perennials, organic toasted coconut chips for smoothies. Bought a mandolin for slicing veggies thin for fermenting, etc.5. Eat the Food- Try NewFoods/Recipe- Made some lamb burgers with tzatziki sauce, hadn't had for years, awesome! Saw some new recipes here, Ian Knauer.com after I saw his show on PBS last night, looks good! Lots of great veggie recipes :)6. Build Community Food Systems- Still selling eggs weekly to a co-worker.7. Recycle/Re-Use- Donated old Venetian blinds to the Habitat Store yesterday, spread tons of compost last 2 weeks. Loaned tools to friend. Going to sell my bike, too heavy, may buy new/used one. I need something lighter for my aging bones.8. Skill Up- Learned hot to use a mandolin without slicing my fingers off :)9. Regenerate What is Lost/SalvageSomething- Will buy some new blades for our Sazall tool. Bark dust for yard, seed some grassy areas that are worn. Lots of little jobs.Both photos from Slowfashioned.orgSlow Clothing Movement-Like a lot of people I know a bit about sustainability, but when it comes to clothes, not so much. While I do lots of thrifting and shop on eBay for used items, I still buy some things new. I was listening to this and I totally get it- Npr.org  For some people the reality right now is they won't buy $35.00 tee shirts because that might be food on the table, but you have to start somewhere. I like the idea of \"chain\" stores that would market these kinds of things, to bring the prices down. Or make your own clothes! Thrifting is still a big part of the equation with TONS of clothing out there, literally, that can be re-used, including vintage clothes that are very well made. It's good to think about. I just got a new work blouse from Goodwill yesterday for $4.00, like new!Master Bedroom Makeover-I'm slowly starting to re-do our master bedroom.  I'll also do a much-needed repaint of the kitchen and possibly the living room. Paint is really worn after 10+ years. After summer break starts I'm going to paint the bedroom a very white gray. I liked the way it came out on our master bath remodel. Now it's a peach, a bit too dark. We had old, cheap blinds that came with the house-I started with our new curtains from Ikea, replacing them for $14.99 (for 2) and I LOVE the birds! I stumbled onto them and bought a cafe rod for $5.00 to go inside the insulated curtains. We have privacy now and lets in more light. I washed them and now just need to hem them a bit. With 5+ more weeks of school I'm letting it go for now. I am SO READY for summer. Too much turmoil at work...Love the birds!I also bought a set of 5\"tile prints\" on stretched canvas for above the bed, from Countrydoor.com Tile Prints  5 for $39.00, a pretty good deal! Since I'm going for white with blue accents I thought this would be a nice shot of color! I may re-position them a bit, the grid might need to be a little wider? I have a few more blue things I'll add soon...Neighbor Posey making friends with Anya thru the screen! Really nice kitty..."},

We had hail/corn snow Tuesday night and really gusty winds, 55 mph maybe? The hail was blowing at a 45 degree angle it was so windy! Luckily the hens all knew to go into the coop, where they were well protected. Good girls! The garden seemed ok thru it all. I'm pretty good at judging wind. Forecast was 45+ so we got it. It scared Anya, and I took some photos. Boy the clouds were black! 70's today and up to 77 next week. It was really windy all day, and Dave did a marathon of yard work. With the heavy rain last Sat. we skipped the work Sunday, just too wet. He also took off the bottom window on the lower part of the coop, and swapped their screen on. More fresh air with the warmer days. Sping is really here!Cool Weather Crops-I found some nice packs of curly kale, red Russian kale (yummy) and collard greens Thursday so I bought some. Last year they were hard to find as I waited too long. Ready to plant tomorrow. I already planted something else kid of fun-Wind spinner from TargetNew Fridge-I LOVE our new fridge!!! By most accounts if the most exciting thing in your life recently is a appliance purchase I guess I do lead a rather boring life! After doing a lot of research (found out later it's recommended at Consumer Report)  we had it delivered. Here's what we did to prep-Two nights before delivery we loaded all our freezer items into our chest freezer. I had been emptying it since we had to defrost it. First times in 3 years! Same night we put all the non-critical fridge items in coolers (without ice) since it was 30 at night and they were in the garage. Mostly condiments, fruits, and veggies.One night before we loaded critical items, meats, dairy, etc., into our mini fridge in the garage, the old college one from the girls. That system worked great!The delivery went smooth, it fit, and it's SO BRIGHT! Two LED lights on top and bottom. Really spacious, and nice little ice maker. Next a new counter and then the kitchen is basically done. I'll be painting the kitchen this summer, since it needs it after 10 years. I hope we can demo the counter, then I can paint, then a new counter, and I'll do the back splash. Like many people we try to do things as we can. If we'd had tons of money we could have done it all the first year. Instead we paid as we went, got a used sink from Habitat, etc., etc...Bright and lots of adjustable shelving!Tons of door storageNice ice makerWe'll move some of our frozen goods in tomorrow from the chest freezerHomesteading Kitchen Gadgets-I have been making lots of foods with very thinly sliced cabbage. I realized how long it was taking me to slice things, and I couldn't get them very consistent. I want to start making sauerkraut and more Curtido, so I thought MANDOLIN! I did some research and found a nice, adjustable mandolin at Target today. It holds the vegetable very safely and you can hook it over a bowl or use flat.Very sharp and a good $20.00 investment- Later I found a Ball Mason jar infuser-I can make teas, tinctures, etc. I foresee lots of cool, refreshing fruit drink/tea combos this summer. $5.99.   Oh, free recipes!"},

It's like a constant battle between winter and spring. It was almost 70 Friday, but in the 40's/50's yesterday and rainy. Today blue skies, and 60-ish, maybe. Tomorrow 75! Then back down 30 degrees, then back to the 40's. Wacky. We have really needed the rain. The air is really fresh and everything is soaked. No sprinklers needed yet! I've been holding off on starting seeds outside with 30's at night. My seed starting trays are ready to go though. I might start some in the next week, just the cool weather veggies. Our new baby :)Sunday Stuff-We're saying good bye to our faithful fridge that was here when we bought the house 10+ years ago. Bye! It's been making random noises, and the water coming out smelled like sulfur lately. We found out the water holding tank is probably contaminated, and we could replace it for $50. We thought about it and decided to just get a new fridge. The new one has the freezer on the bottom, pulls open, with an ice maker (hot here!). It's nice and REALLY bright inside and I have come to HATE side by sides. A real waste of space in my opinion. This has more cubic ft. for less than a side by side, and cheaper. It's coming Wed. Oh boy! I've been cleaning out the fridge and freezer. Here's our new baby from Homedepot.com, where we also got an extra 10% off that day. It was the best deal in town for us.Garden and chicken-wise, Dave pulled down the coop sun room today, stored it for next year, and the girls are loving having more open space. The sun room is great in the winter with the cold and rain. Yesterday they loved the nice dry extra interior space. Now today, more room! Within and hour or so they had tilled the pine shavings in already, good girls. We also replaced the heated winter waterer with the summer one.I need to prune my blackberries as they had a really hard, tough winter-My new neighbor, Posey! Looking in my kitchen sliding door-I'd seen her in the backyard a few times. I found out today she belongs to the renter behind us. She's a big love button when I go outside, so I gave her a few kitty treats. Shhh, don't tell :)We're replacing our damaged laminate counter in the kitchen soon and upgrading to a solid surface. I'm not a fan of granite, but I like quartz but Dave doesn't like stone. I don't know why, sigh. I just want something low maintenance and durable. So I'm looking at Corian or something similar, in a light gray. Something like this-A bit darker than our cabinets, we have a lighter cherry. I will do the back splash, and we may be able to do our last small bathroom counter too. I LOVE the idea of under counter sinks. stays clean and looks great! Just wipe down.I love our silver leaf maple, but what a mess EVERY spring. This stuff falls everywhere!My Russian sage survived behind the coop all winter :)"},

After resting it was much better last night and today. While I was looking at all the fruit tree blossoms this week I thought one things- canning!!! I really missed having zero apples last year, no pies, no applesauce, etc. Our little pear tree has really done well. Last year, it's first full season, we had about 8 or 10 pears. Dave's Mom canned tons of pears when he was a kid, so I look forward to do that too. And pear crisps, and pear butter, and... :) Tons of nectarines too, again. The blackberries need a good pruning next weekend, lots of dead branches as usual. We woke up to a drenched yard and wet fences, got some much-needed rain last night. All day today was sunny, rainy and cold. More on the way, yeah!!! It was odd to see most of the foothills covered in snow today, a welcome sight. More on the way, snow/rain tomorrow morning and the next day. In the next week or 2 I will start some seeds, depending on the weather-New seed starting shelves ready to fill, bolted to fenceMy only hope with this early spring has been I hope the fruit tree ripen BEFORE I go back to school. Every year a week or 2 AFTER school starts canning starts.

We used these, both thrifted-the oldAfter doing a lot of research from Craigslist, to thrifted, to new wood hutches we finally came up with this, a chrome shelving unit from Homedepot for $99.00 -Dave and I put it together pretty easily, and he secured it to the wall. It's nice that the shelves are adjustable, so if needs change it can change too. It's 48\" wide, 72\" high and 18\" deep. Lots of room! I will play with adding some more baskets maybe, but the main things is for a lot of canned goods. I dumped a lot of the old jams we never used, etc. The dresser was demo'd as it was broken, and the smaller cart will go to one of our girls or donation.Anya got exhausted watching and had to take a break :)Preserving Meyer Lemons In Brine-After seeing some organic Meyer lemons in the store today I bought five. I had seen some recipes for preserving them ranging from salty to salt w/oil. I wanted some with a sugar/salt type brine and found this recipe- Preserved Lemons It was pretty simple, I followed the brine recipe, but skipped the turmeric and coriander seeds and did 3 cloves, and added a bit of allspice. I was looking for something more tangy, less Mediterranean or Middle Eastern. The kitchen smells divine! BE WARNED- when you slice into hot lemons hold them over the pot, or keep them in the pot, as they will expel lots of boiling juice! Don't burn yourself.lemons simmeringReady for the fridge, after I topped off the brine"},

Big Thrifting, Ikea Trip, Mini-Greenhouse ", "date": "Mar 26, 2015", "text": "Heading into Eastern Oregon near Baker, not much snow!Road Trip!It was Spring break this week for me, so Dave took the week off too. We went to Portland, Oregon this Sunday and got back last night. Dave has a relative who's very ill, the main reason we went. We also both needed a break! The weather wasn't too bad, rain off and on. We saw some sights, discovered a few new eat out spots, and drove down memory lane. Our one daughter traveled ahead of us, and then we met up mid-trip and had some fun time together. We visited the amazingly beautiful Veteran's cemetery, where both our parents, and my Grandparents, are buried. Both my parents were in the Navy in WWII, and my beloved Grandfather served in the Army Air Corp in WWI, and the Army in WWII. It was really peaceful there.Sadly Portland has MUCH more traffic than when we moved here 15+ years ago. There are sea lions in the Columbia river now which separates Washington from Oregon. We had lunch out at a place that overlooks the river with Dave's brother. He mentioned that the sea lions that eat a lot of the salmon, not so great. When I saw big black heads I knew what they were. Odd, but that happened after we left. They used to be in the ocean. They've migrated inland. One of our daughters babysat our cat and the chickens, worked great. While I enjoyed the trip, I was glad to get home to my own bed. I was so tired by 3 pm today from running errands I laid down to take a nap. Dave was banging around a lot so I got back up, never a dull moment! It's 65 today, 75 forecast for tomorrow, so we'll try and get a lot done out outside the next 3 days before the work week starts again. Dave's currently blasting out the gutters. Yummy :) Here's some shots from the trip...Going over the Columbia into WashingtonView from brother-in-laws homeColumbia river in the distanceGetting into PortlandUnion Station train depot, gorgeous!Love the ceilings!Sea lions out there...The former Governor's mansion?Multnomah Falls- Visitor's centerBig suncatcherBig Thrifting-I asked Dave (more told him) that we HAD to go to the Goodwill Superstore in Portland. I think it's the largest on the West coast (or used to be). It's HUGE! I found some fun things, and scored a beautiful coat. I found an Italian-made ceramic Olive oil bottle (new sticker marked $25.00) for $2.99, a sun catcher, same price. My BIG score was a JJill plum corduroy coat (lined) marked $20.00 but was 1/2 off. Like new, knee length, fitted waist, with big buttons. Really cute!Is that a chicken I spy??? From Ikea.comIkea Trip-We had to make our road trip Ikea pilgrimage! My daughter had never been there before and loved it! Since we had broken 2 small plates and 1 bowl of our set I bought there, time to re-stock. Luckily they had \"open stock\" and we bought our replacements, and 1 more set (for 6). Our extended family is growing for holidays, etc. so we also bought another set of flatware too. They have so much cool stuff! I bought a new comforter cover, a blue ticking fabric. I learned the hard way their duvet covers run a bit small, but a King sized worked perfect for our thick Queen set. Great deal, better than anywhere else-Also got some foods, organic pear cider (OMG it's good!), glass containers for food storage, bath mat, some small vases, and bird curtains (above) for our bedroom. I'll be painting it soon and we'll ditch the venetian blinds, cheap and a pain to clean. I LOVE the fabric! At $14.99 I can't buy fabric that cheap to make my own. While I enjoy sewing curtains are a pain. We'll buy a small rod and hang them inside the insulated curtains for privacy and to let light in. It's the start of a bedroom makeover:) Waiting til summer for that!Mini-Greenhouse-We had thought about buying a small greenhouse, but decided on something smaller with my idea of using it to start seeds. I did some online research and we found the above at Home Depot, $35.00. I'll tie wrap the shelves for better stability, and I'll find some scrap wood to put underneath to keep it warmer at night. It's a good size for us, and will be easy to store inside in the winter. I bought a bunch of seeds and some starter trays. I have some other random ones I can use and potting soil. I may set it out in the garden and tie it down for the wind, or put on our deck. Might be more stable there. I'm trying to buy less plants at the store AND get a head start on the growing season, so I think this will fit the bill! I'll be more self sufficient and will start saving more seeds..."},

Lassen, all photos from Nationalgeographic.comRecord Low Snow In The West Means???Ironically, but not surprising, while the Mid-West and East coast have been slammed with record snow, the west has been suffering, again. We have had record low snowfall (and warm temps) here in the Boise area surrounding mountains and farther north. California has not fared well either. Listening to the news the snowfall for parts of the Sierra Nevada mountains that feeds to lots of California had 4 INCHES, NOT FEET, of snow. And it's March. This means a lot of things, from what I know, having lived there-*If there aren't already serious water restrictions, there should be, and might be. Better buy a bunch of rain barrels.*The agricultural economy will continue to suffer, with less crops being planted. That could spell higher food prices. Record prices?*More fires, and a longer fire season. California is already prepping for fire season by hiring fire fighters. They are re-thinking what \"fire season\" means, as it may be 12 months a year.*If California continues to have record droughts (and there's no reason to think that will change) what will happen to Nevada who relies on some of their water from there???Watch the video on the National Geo link on water drillers.

Not on a Friday night, with great spring weather forecast! So... I called my essential oil guru pal Christine and she fixed me up. Per her suggestion I went down the road and bought a bottle of organic tea tree essential oil (Melaleuca). I already had a \"carrier\" oil, sweet almond oil. I did as she directed- after I showered to go to bed I mixed together 1 TBL almond oil in a small bowl with 6 drops of tea tree oil. I rubbed it into the pads of both feet, between the toes, and a dab on each sore throat gland. Went to bed. I've used a lot of OTC, and homeopathic cold stuff. What was really interesting was that I DIDN'T get all stuffed up in the middle of the night. You know how it is- you lay down and the longer you sleep the more plugged up you get. I slept like a baby! I started sniffling around 9 a.m., so I blew my nose a few times and rolled over for another hour. I got up, felt rested, used it again. It's almost 4 p.m. and I really feel pretty good! A little minor stuffy, but glands are almost normal, and no sore throat. It was $7.00 for the oil I bought (above) a good, cheap healthy fix!  Spring Garden Prep-Spring really is busting out all over! It's 62 right now with 68 forecast for Tuesday! What month is this? I think it's here to stay. I saw LOTS of Robins today, always a sign of spring here. Today Dave deep- cleaned the coop, with a little help from me. I scrubbed the coop windows, and helped rake out the used pine shavings into the garden. Dave turned all the main garden soil. We didn't do that last year and had less production on our veggies. Won't skip that again! The hens LOVED all the bugs they found after he tilled. I tried not to over-do it today, with my minor bug. I scrubbed my back windows too (living room) with my windex scrubber kit. When the sun came out it really showed all the winter storm dirt. Now all shiny and clean!!! I've got lots of fun things coming up and here's a peek at some-More flowers upItalian parsley is up tooGirls loving the tilled gardenPine shavings added, rest to the compost pile and raised bedClean windows!!!Raspberries new growthHard to tell the color here, but it's a rich DARK brown, and it's DRY! :)Backyard's really greening upStrawberries With Mascarpone-I bought some Mascarpone cheese a while back and never used it. I bought some strawberries last week (had to!) and so I looked for a dessert recipe online and found this- Summer Berries w/Mascarpone I used just strawberries and it was great! Mascarpone, if you've never had it, it a really thick creamy cheese, best for desserts. Almost a cross between whipping cream and cream cheese. I made the mascarpone (no yogurt added) by adding a little sugar and vanilla, mixed well. Sliced the berries and added a little sugar. I bought a small bag of butter shortbread cookies at the grocery outlet. They are stars as they were holiday leftovers :) I made a a bed of the creamy stuff, topped with berries and crumbled the cookies on top. Added a few extra on the side! This is a really fast, simple, \"something special\" dessert.  More tonight! When we have our own berries in this summer it will be a extra big hit!The Pineapple King-I bought a fresh pineapple recently and had the core leftover. The hens loved the inner fleshy part on the skins. I knew the core would be too tough for them, so I threw it under the tree for the squirrels. This guy grabbed it, took it to the top of the compost pile and had a feast! He was so entranced he didn't noticed me creeping up taking shots. Later he dashed off leaving it behind for the next guy. Nice treat..."},

I love the part of urban homesteading of eating the foods you raise :)Lots of eggs!I was getting a bit tired of frittatas and French baked eggs for dinners. Last week I realized I hadn't made omelettes for years! Eureka! I got out some cilantro, local salsa, limes, cheddar and jack cheese. I looked up a basic recipe to refresh my brain, and easy-peasy. The omelette came out perfect, moist, nice and fluffy, and light! The main thing I read with omelette's is DON'T whisk your eggs (too many air bubbles), and oil the pan (even if non-stick). Here' what I did-Spicy Salsa Omelette recipe-I used 8 eggs (for 2) , beat with fork, poured into buttered pan, cook until almost done, rotating pan to make sure most of the raw egg gets cooked. When almost done I added to 1/2 the omelette- 1/4 cup chopped cilantro, 1/4 jack and 1/4 cheddar cheese. Wait til mostly melted, then flip 1/2 over on top. I kept an eye on it until the cheese started to melt out. I didn't try to flip it since it was pretty large, so I put the lid on for about 2 minutes. Cut in 1/2, remove carefully from pan, put on plate, top with spicy salsa, cilantro and serve with lime wedge. Enjoy!

Manage Reserves- Get a GoodDeal/Barter/Stock Up/Prep- Got a good deal (1/2 off) on homeopathic flu remedies. I'm actually working on the Pantry Challenge still, using up frozen, canned and pantry foods. I've really saved a lot of $$$, and we need to defrost the freezer! Our washer finally died, after 15 years, and 1000's of loads! We got a nice, new scratched/dinged front loading washer at Sears outlet, saved about $150.00 anywhere else on a cheap model. This one was 1/2 off, for $599. with a 1-day sale with 6% off which covered sales tax. We looked at repairing our old one, but it would be more costly than a replacement. We also noticed how much FASTER the spin is, as the clothes are coming out much DRYER. Yeah for saving on the power bill drying the clothes! We got it on Valentine's Day.

I'm cutting WAY back on my wheat, more about that later... Started using Hemp protein powder in fruit smoothies.

I did a separate thrifting post below since I had such a great score today! I have a few things for eBay I will sell. Too much great stuff I just don't wear much. We put out the old washer for the recycling guy, but the steel thieves took it first. Oh well, not worth much anyway...8. Skill Up- Learning some new recipes.

Delfts (if the mark is genuine) is a world-famous ceramic maker Delftware, and I recognized the name. The piece is either a salt cellar or a wall mounted vase. It's triangular and flat on the back with a hole on the top for hanging. Anyone else guess? I think it may be fairly old, but I can't find anything online on the markings...

Kitty has rubbed it, pawed it, pushed it, but finally gave up the other night and cuddled with Dave in his nest with his leg crossed. Poor cat is SO abused, and jealous of a piece of plastic!"},
{"title": "Front Yard Food Production & Re-Sale Value, What Month Is This? Thrifting", "date": "Feb 12, 2015", "text": "Front Yard Food Production & Re-Sale Value-When you own your own house, in an urban setting, re-sale value is always in the back of your mind. Unless you plan to live there forever, it's a concern. All of the improvements we've done so far (except the coop/back veggie garden) improves the value of our home- bathroom remodel, new windows, doors, furnace/AC, deck, appliances, etc. We know if we ever sell we'll hopefully attract some who wants a similar lifestyle. If not, they can plant sod and tear down the coop. That's the reality of it. Last summer I saw a gorgeous front yard that had incorporated raised beds, and they camouflaged them with gorgeous shrubs and trellises. No one wants to look at a dead/empty yard in the winter. With strategic placement of evergreen shrubs, and fencing, Dave and I think we'll do it. We already added a replacement picket fence on the front side yard, as the old fencing (front and back) was 25 years old and shot when we bought the house. We'll use primarily recycled lumber and start beds this spring. A nice mix of veggies, and flowers. I prefer perennials, no seeds and they always come back. You can also divide them and share with friends! Here's a peek at our front yard, with lots of potentials space for raised (or not) beds, trellises, etc. We're thinking of adding more cedar picket fencing along the front, the same design as the side. I'd like some winter interest when the beds are empty, so maybe a fence inside the existing flower beds on the front, with more shrubs added behind it? We would leave some turf as some green space and just mow the in between areas...Lots of spaceHere's a few ideas I like that could work with some modifications- Burpee.com- Vegetables Front Yard -                                              From- Viralnova.com- Lawn Garden  \"After photo\"Great transformation here too, with slide show on link of before and after From Grass To GardenWOW!!! Too much for me personally, since we may sell some day. Do you live in an urban area and do front yard food production?What Month Is This?It was 60 this weekend, so I let the girls out :)They found lots of bugs!Anya crying to get out. Sorry house kitty!Thrifting-I really scored this weekend at Goodwill! I bought the cutest wood birdhouse (above) for $3.99! The door is even hinged and opens!I love the roof detail! Glass beads...I also found a perfect Sakura Debbie Mumm teapot, $5.00. Her ceramic home items are pretty expensive in stores. This will replace my very old blue one, maybe off to one of my girls! Her website has some really cute desktop wallpapers here Debbiemumm.com  I LOVE this one-\"Winter Garden\"I also scored a real birch bark log for a Yule log! I've been looking forever!!! I will remove all the cheap plastic stuff next winter and add some nicer greenery. $1.99! It even has legs!I also scored 2 really nice, like-new blouses on eBay, 1 LL Bean, 1 Columbia Sportswear..."},

It's Dave's birthday today, and I decided to buy him a new, home office chair. Out running errands I gave him the option of choosing one with me, or I would choose. So... we bought a nice, new black one. While we were at the store (O.Max) and I saw a nice, small desk. We had a large thrifted one (above) that was really too big for the space. So, we bought it. These 2 photos are the \"before pictures\". It's stuffed in with the canning cabinet, various storage, backpacks, and a hodge podge of  other \"stuff\". Time to clean! The \"after\" pics will be posted in the next week!!! Stay tuned...What's With The Weather?It was 65 today, what the heck??? We raked leaves, I put the rest of generic winter stuff away, and had the garage wide open. We did some maintenance on the coop (some more fresh litter), and Dave raked. What month is this, May? I really hope this doesn't mess up our shrubs and perennials. Lots of rain headed this way, avalanches in the mountains and flooding. BUT the sun was FINALLY out and BLUE SKIES! After weeks of fog, inversion and clouds I LOVED IT! But it's worrisome....Queso Fundido Recipe-After seeing this on the Pantry Challenge at Goodcheapeats.com I decided to try it. Verdict? Too greasy for us. I will try a modified, different version with ground turkey and 1/2 the cheese. But the idea is good- spicy meat with melted cheese, on warm tortillas, cilantro and salsa. What's not to love? I served it with Trader Joe's Green Hatch Chili Salsa (wonderful!) and Red Salsa. Yummy.Ready For Heart Day :)After taking down the rest of the generic winter stuff, I put up some fun things for Valentine's Day. I bought the heart above 75% off last year, the week after VD. It's a fun thing to do, buy now, use later. I also found this for $3.50 at Goodwill last year and saved it for Spring (even though we're not there yet!)-Adds some pink!A little something in the kitchen..."},
{"title": "Pantry Challenge, Kale Grape Blue Cheese Salad, Scandinavian Heart Flip, Where's Winter???", "date": "Feb 1, 2015", "text": "Pantry Challenge-I've really saved some $$$ the last 2 weeks doing this. I'm making my way thru the freezer, and my grocery cart was pretty empty today- mostly dairy, fruits, veggies. I made some shrimp jambalaya last week (lots of leftovers), baked some frozen chicken. I made another pizza. Yesterday Dave was gone for dinner so I did grab a bag of shrimp at the store and had a giant shrimp cocktail for dinner. Yummy, with leftover home-made extra spicy sauce. I dug out a package (one of my rare boxed mixes) of a Krusteaz blueberry muffin mix. I added cinnamon, nutmeg, and almond extract. I will say- if you want to make muffins or scones their mixes are wonderful! Really great quality, but I wish they'd make some whole grain versions. Tonite I made Cuban-Style Black Beans & Rice with canned beans, veggies, lime, and rice I had on hand. Very healthy and filling! I did add extra Chili powder, some Cumin and Thyme. I always double or triple the batch we like it some much. Just add lime wedge, cilantro. Sour cream if you like!Sorry, we ate the salad too fast to get a pic, maybe next time :)Kale, Grape, & Blue Cheese Salad-I found a couple versions of this and modified it to make my own recipe. Here's how I made my new kale salad recipe-Take 1 bunch of fresh kale, wash, strip off ribs. Rip into a large bowl, drizzle with 1 TBL. olive oil, and sprinkle 1 TSP. of salt. Massage well and really work the kale for about 1 minute. It will soften and be sort of silky. Add 2 TBL. red wine vinegar, fresh pepper, and toss well. Mix in red grapes and crumbled blue cheese, about 1/4 each. Toss well. You could sub bacon for the cheese of use other sweet fruits.  It was really awesome!!! It's a keeper! Scandinavian Heart Flip-With my love of folk art, and Scandinavian country decor, I decided to do something to bring the outdoors in. I had a $5.00 off a $10.00 purchase at Jo-Ann's fabrics. Easy shopping to do. I walked around Jo-Ann's til I had a Eureka! moment. Here's what I bought, 1/2 off, with a coupon-I couldn't find a plain twig heart so I decided to use it as a form. I bought moss \"ribbon\" (who knew?)-$3.50I used a wire cutter and scissors to remove the plastic pips and ribbon-All readyI then wrapped the moss and secured it with a little wire-Some of the moss fuzzies fell off, so I used some spray adhesive to cover some of the exposed twigs with the green fuzz. I wanted it to look rustic and not too perfect. I trimmed down some left-over burlap for a ribbon and hung it up. It was a bit too long, so I just overlapped it-  I love it! Total cost $6.00! I re-used the pips into my ivy-In the same mode- I found a nice Scan-style frame the other day I had stored. I printed out an antique map of Scandinavia and framed it. Maybe it will help me get there sooner :)It's on my list of things to go and see the Fjords of Norway and visit Sweden-From Visitnorway.com A World Heritage SiteSweden, on the coast, from VisitSweden.comMaple tree should be naked!Where's Winter???It was 47 and sunny yesterday. A bit of rain today and almost 50 today. Our back maple tree looks like the shot above. What wrong with this picture? The tree should be bare! We had a mild Oct., 8 in November with 9\" of snow, then the leaves never fell off the trees. They're still falling.Bizarre weather coming next week, in the 50's! What the heck! While I'm glad we don't get the storms they do back east, we need some cold weather, or my garden will suffer~~~ Wishing for snow ;)"},

Pantry Challenge and Dark Days. I used frozen red bell peppers, frozen pepperoni, leftover cheeses, my frozen homemade/organic pesto, and local pizza dough. A double header! Tonight we're having Jambalaya (the mix is pretty good!) with shrimp and Andouille sausage. I have leftover bread to go with it, and salad with homemade dressing.My InspirationVintage Chicken Wire Frame-Last summer I saw the frame above in Idaho City, and snapped a quick pic. They had planed the wood down to bare. On the way home I found an old, chippy, $10.00 local window frame at Habitat, and Dave and I broke out the glass and added leftover chicken wire. I thought it woulds be a great way to display my vintage kitchen items.I recently took a small wire brush to ours, and I got to decorating today, it took a few tries for placement but easy easy otherwise. Dave added the wire and bracket to the back. All done! Here's the print that was there before, over our dining room table-New frame-Total cost- $10.00Since it was much heavier, Dave added 2 brackets on the back and hung on the studs. I don't think it's going anywhere! Since it's hung with raffia I can change the placement pretty easily if needed.Freebies-Yesterday I was reminded of the adage- one person's trash is another treasure! I met with some fellow librarians to hang out, and some brought swappables. I scored a hand-beaded butterfly, with glass beads. I thought it was plastic until I got it home and looked up the name on the tag Grassrootscreations.com Pretty much a fair trade deal and glass beads! Really nice. I hung it over my computer in the dining room-Reminds me of Spring!I also got a new pitcher from Italy, nice! I decided to plant my new ivy in it :)I like the green ivy and the green kitchen items. Maybe I'll train it up the chicken wire! Love freebies!!!"},

I did it tonite. I found this helpful- 1 Month Menu Plan Grid  It's a nice sized, free printable menu grid/calendar. I also found this nice, simple freezer inventory list here- Organizinghomelife.comThis got me started to write the basics of what we have, in the freezer and pantry closet. Unlike most people we don't have a lot of frozen meats, since we don't eat a lot of meat. We eat lots of vegetarian foods!We had 2 meals so far- frozen chicken smothered in homemade frozen pesto, with leftover french bread and salad. Ditto the leftover chicken, with taters and more salad.Tonight I made- Spicy black bean soup and corn bread, good for a cold, rainy night. I use the pre-made \"soup\" as a base and added what's in the photo, + 1 more can of corn & spices. I mashed the canned beans slightly. Yummy and filling with the corn muffins made with buttermilk.Main pantry closetChest freezer, a great investment!Our version will look a bit different, since we're not feeding a family with kids. With just the 2 of us, our meals can be more flexible. I know I won't be able to do a whole month without fresh veggies, milks and fruit. I may buy more meats too, since I don't store a lot of those. Some of the items in my pantry are for long term/emergency food storage so they are off limits for this purpose. I am generally just challenging myself to use up more everyday stored foods, to rotate them and then will work on replacing with newer foods. I have a lot more fish than I thought so I'll make a Finnish Salmon Pie. I made it last year, added lots of peas, and great flavor! There's always lots of fresh eggs too. Speaking of the hens- they'll get any freezer-burned foods (if any) so they will be recycled :)I got out these handy sheets I hadn't used yet to play with menu planning-Here's a few more tips to save money! Lessons Learned on the Front Lines of Frugality"},

I had gone to the town of Solvang, CA on a trip with my Dad as a kid. I remember eating these little Danish, luscious puffballs. Then I read about them recently! My daughter got me a gift certificate from Amazon for Christmas, and I found a great deal on a pan. While I'm not a fan of many kitchen gadgets, I got one for myself, as a gift :) It came with a great little cookbook that worked great. I used the basic recipe, with buttermilk and stiff eggs whites. They came out super fluffy, like a cross between a donut and a popover. Yummy!!!My little panRecipe book includedHow to make Aebleskivers, from Solvang where I went as a kid!Do You See What I See?-No more holidays, now it's all about winter!

One day I asked myself- what's different? I realized I usually hung my purse, lunch bag and tote bag for work on one of the chairs, kinda messy.

I saw this Katiebrownhomeworkshop.com and thought, hmm, huckleberry roast beef. Why not? Well, I got a pot roast instead thru a miscommunication :) So, change of plans. I wanted something really simple, with no veggies. I found this Beef Pot Roast (with onions) and it came out fab! Juicy, moist tender, lots of Au jus. I only added 1 TBL of Worcestershire to the recipe. I saved the onions for the next night, and made French Dips. First night I served it with buttery/pepper whole grain linguine, and salad. Night 2 dips. For the Au jus I added about 3 TBL of flour, thickened slightly, whisked a lot, then 3 cups of beef broth. Perfect, not a gravy, but slightly thicker broth. Next time I'll try Katie's recipe. They're all good! Love her show on PBS :)One Month Pantry Challenge-I knew I needed to work more on my freezer and pantry items. I used some home-grown, frozen nectarines, and leftover fresh cranberries and made crumb-topped dessert. Wonderful and tart! Then I read A Months Meal Plan For The Pantry Challenge  and had a \"oh yes!\" moment. I will have to do this a bit differently since there's only 2 of us, but it's a good starter plan. This weekend I'll go thru everything and make a list. I can save a lot of money, experiment, and save a lot of $$$. Great idea! I'll post more of my challenge!!! Feel free to join in :)"},

I wanted something nice, soft cotton, durably made. I went thrifting lots of times, but could never find one.

Deep Donating, Chicken Warming Treats- Snow & 4 Degrees", "date": "Jan 1, 2015", "text": "Happy New Year!!!I'm hoping you and yours all have your best year ever!Deep Donating-I do a lot of donating year round. I usually do more in the summer and winter, when I'm off work for break. I have more time to sort, sift, re-organize and re-evaluate. I'm a big proponent of not having stuff just to have stuff. There are lots of people who have so much stuff they lose things in their own home. I find that scary! While I know I'm pretty organized, things can get sloppy. I just donated a full carload of stuff- clothing, shoes, bedding, pillows, 2 framed prints, a bread machine, mugs, water bottles and more. It's good to purge! I finished my linen/bedding closet yesterday and now it's 1/2 full. I'm tackling the towel/medicine closest tomorrow. It's just so easy to accumulate stuff. These tips re-inspired me to dig deeper, donate deeper- Creative Ways to Declutter  There's lots more info online on this that you might find useful. I will be donating more holiday decor after I saw this year I still have too many winter/Christmas goodies. I'd rather have less that's really great looking than just a lot of stuff. That negative space really enhances things. This kind of cluttered house below would drive me nuts!Chicken Warming Treats- Snow & 4 Degrees-With temps down to 4 degrees at night this week  (14 now at 1 p.m.) we have the heat lamp on in the coop. It's hard wired in and very safe. I turn it on when it's in the mid-20's or lower. I give the hens extra treats in the cold weather to give the them some extra calories. While they get daily fruits, veggies, stale bread, meats, etc. I took pity on them yesterday. I bought meal worms and cracked corn! Oo la la! They had never seen meal worms when I thew some in the coop, but attacked them voraciously!!! \"Dried bugs, OMG!\" They liked the cracked corn I gave them today as well, much cheaper :) The sun finally came out the last 2 days! I lured the girls out by hanging outside the coop door, with an old towel on the ground. They actually came all the way out! \"Ma, the sun's out, now what do we do???\" After 5 minutes they went back in for more treats....Where's the treats???"},

Here's a list, not necessarily in order....* In the winter we had some really cold weather, down to 0. Brr.  Kept the chickens and other outdoor critters alive. Lots of bird food, treats, and the sun room for the hens.Heated bird bath helped this guy :) Got it thrifted!*In the spring we finally remodeled our main bathroom ourselves (except the exotic plumbing), and we love it! We had major water rot in part of the floor, but not too bad. We got mostly Ikea items and I love the gray flooring!*I rehabbed my 2 living room chairs with foam, batting and new covers. Love the grain sack style :) And the covers were 1/2 price!*We insulated and sheet rocked (leftover from the bathroom) the ceiling of the coop. It has been much warmer so far!!! It's supposed to be 4 degrees tomorrow night, brrrr....  Dave also added an additional vent for better airflow.*In early summer we expanded the back veggie garden quite a bit. Probably about 200-300 more sq. feet. We planted Raspberries and Marion berries, and got a tiny harvest. I added some perennial flowers and veggies there, and had a pretty good harvest. Less mowing and more food production!Before, hose marks the new bedAfter, my girl checking it outAfter, with squash, cukes and herbs*Got a great harvest of nectarines! Zero apples and 5 pears from our new baby tree in front, big fruit!Canned a LOT! Freezer is jammed too, time for more cobblers!*Had both our front fruit trees professionally pruned, much better shape. Too big for us to tackle.*We had new gutters installed (working great) and I bought a new rain barrel-  *Got 4 new chicks! We had 2 retired, then 1 passed away. The 1 that was left had gotten really aggressive, so she was re-homed with our little roo we accidentally got.

It's been another fun year of sharing ideas, photos, and reading all the encouraging comments. Thanks to all!For next year? We're going to re-do the front yard for more food production and beauty. Come spring we'll be at it. Right now... it's snowing~~~Coal House FamiliesCoal House At War Show-I stumbled on to this gem of a \"reality show\" on PBS, and wow! It's about the very simple, and tough, life in a 1940's coal area in Wales. Funny, sad, and very inspiring. Episode 1 is below, and it's still airing. When you were \"drafted\" in Wales it was either in the military, OR the coal mines. Blackouts, air raid drills, children being sent away to safe areas (sometimes for years), what a tough life! I hope you'll watch some...Kitchen in one of the coal cottagesAll ready!Chicken Wire Frame- This last summer in Idaho City I saw this in a store and decided to create my own-$27.00, my frame was $10!There's was taken down to bare wood, and I prefer the chippy paint. I found an old window on the way home from there, at the Habitat Store, and Dave helped me break out the glass. A couple days ago I took a small wire brush to it and wiped it down with a damp cloth. The we stretched left-over chicken wire to the back, stapled it well and covered the edges with duct tape. I'll be getting all my green, vintage kitchen tools out and adding them to do something similar to the above. I'll post photos when I'm done!I love the layers of paintAnya had to get into the act :)Dark Days Challenge Meal-With the holidays so busy I didn't focus on this as much. This week I did make breakfast for dinner, since Dave was out of town. With my own eggs and local challah bread I made---- french toast! It was amazing, and even more so with a few strips of uncured, organic bacon. Yummy!"},

Our adult children who were in town came for dinner. I sent the afternoon baking my sweet and spicy Lebkuchen cookies and my flour-less holiday chocolate tart. The cookies are made of ground almonds, raisins, orange zest, molasses and more. Very yummy and I used my Ikea cookie cutters-For dinner I made roasted chicken breast, lemon linguine (Nigella Lawson's), sauteed fresh spinach and rustic Italian bread. So divine! My first day without a nap since surgery. We exchanged gifts after dinner and played board games. No holiday TV, just fun! Sadly I realized since we got rid of the VHS tapes a while back most of my holiday movies are gone. Luckily I received a Amazon gift card. I see The Christmas Story DVD in my near future :)  We LOVE that movie. While it was slightly before my time I still resonate with it.Hubby got a job with a huge company that gets 50% off on Carhartt items! Wow!!! I looked up the women's items and the large tote bag grabbed me. My work bag is soft and pretty worn (from 10 years) and so Santa brought me a new bag. I love it!!! Nice and big and stiff, for paper and stuff going to and from work. Basic black too. Thanks Dave, I mean Santa!Random bathroom shotEye Recovery-I'm doing very well so far, after my cataract removal. Especially since I demanded more narcotics :) Last time, with my other eye, I was a bit TOO lightly sedated and started breathing a bit too hard mid-surgery. I think they're (from what I saw) used to dealing with 80 Lb. 90 years old. I'm a robust 50+ year old, and a bit bigger = more meds. This time they gave me enough so I was VERY relaxed and don't remember much. Works for me. I'm glad I did it now, since I can rest my eyes as needed, do the drop 3xs a day, etc. Thanks for all the prayers and good wishes!!!2\"-3\" expected tomorrow night!Thrifting-Dave and I ran some errands today. We hit a thrift store and we found a hose that kinks small up for winter use (if needed), the cute wooden stocking above (new & sparkly) $1.00, and this-As I sit here drinking my Scottish tea, I think it was a good addition! I mean- who doesn't want a Santa-ish kilted guy on the holiday shelf?   It looks nicer in real life :) I'm part Scotch/Irish so it works..."},

Eye Surgery Tomorrow", "date": "Dec 22, 2014", "text": "My Free Print and Thrifted FrameFun & Frugal Holidays-Over the years I've found lots of easy ways to save money (and your sanity), by staying away from the \"big holiday shopping season\". It's just planning ahead and it's actually really easy. Here's some ideas....*I've gotten a lot of holiday/winter decorations at thrift stores. I like to focus on winter decor with some Christmas/Yule things. When I take down the tree and holiday things, it's still festive and cheery. I found LOTS of great things, really expensive things, that are like new, but cheap. We got bought our fake tree! at a thrift store. I recently bought a $30.00 Santa table topper (price tag still attached)  for $4.00-*I always decorate our old barn window with our holiday cards we receive (not all here yet). Just jazz up some of your existing features-Ditto our dining room light fixture, a gingerbread man garland (thrifted too)-Here's some other things I've thrifted over the years-Thrifted shelf, slate sign, frame and print, large gnomeThrifted white lanterns, greenery, vase and contents. It's my Solstice vase!*With our adult kids we went to a simple gift exchange, drawing names. No one has to get everyone a gift. We just enjoy spending time together and relaxing, and eating fun holiday goodies! Usually those once a year meals, desserts and snacks...* I always stock up on baking ingredients on sale (sometimes in the summer) and freeze them. I stock up on dry goods/drinks for the holidays too. Things like crackers, nuts, drinks, dried/cured meats and just buy a little at a time. You don't get that big financial hit preparing for a gathering by having to buy it all at once.*I bought all my stocking stuffers for my 3 adult girls- olive oil soaps, organic moisturizers, Swiss chocolates all deeply discounted. Shhh, don't tell :)You can still have a gorgeous home and relaxing time by just being more flexible. And save a bundle!!!Amazon Freebies!-When I went to Amazon a couple days ago a box popped up. I said I had earned some visa $$$ to spend. After I read the fine print (carefully) I was able to buy $110. worth of items! No charge! Yippee! Basically I had spent enough money there on my one credit card to earn points. I bought- a pair of Nike track pants for Dave, some hard boiled eggs carriers, Ikea kitchen towels, some Meyer lemon cookies and Lingonberries. The runner above is my fave! It's reversible with snowflakes on one side and plaid on the other. I LOVE it!!! I guess it pays to keep your eyes open....Eye Surgery Tomorrow-I'm off first thing to have my 2nd cataract removed. I'm so looking forward to this! A blurry eye is no fun. The docs actually did a ultra sound and said it was pretty thick. With 2 weeks off I decideed it would be a good time for it. I can rest and relax. We're having a small Christmas dinner, etc. with some of the kids out of town. Perfect timing. Soo... I may not post for a bit depending on how my eye does... So.....Happy Holidays!!!And Happy New Year!!!Anya's long winter nap, again :)"},

I put the chickens in late yesterday. I let them out mid-day today to stretch their legs. An hour or so out then they were soaked, and put themselves in. I closed the trap door and gave them some greens. Happy chicken dance :)Fermented Radishes & Carrots-I've always loved radishes , so I decided to ferment some using this recipe- Cultures for Health  I added a little dill, garlic powder and carrots. The day ferment was ok, so I did 7, much better. Really good and very mild, not salty. The brine is cloudy and radishes lost some color, but still tasty and good for the gut!Cranberry Cornmeal Torte-Years ago I found this recipe and it's one of my top faves, with fresh cranberries. The corn meal gives it some crunch and the dough is perfect- buttery and tasty. I made 2 tonite, 1 for a gathering and 1 for here. Easy peasy! I use butter and more about 1 cup of berries, really cover it. It's here- Cranberry Cornmeal Torte Enjoy!Happy Christmas to any Canadians out there!Go hosers!!!"},

They are so danged cute! I had found a pre-lit, small tree at a thrift store, the lights even worked. So I added her chickens, some small ornaments I had, fabric on the bottom and it's done! I put up the rest of our holiday decor and everything looks very festive. Lights everywhere to welcome the shortest night of the year on the 21st solstice. I started some paper white Narcissus for New Years, love them! We also put up our much-downsized tree, it looks great. I really don't miss having to rearrange the whole room for a tree. We bought a very narrow one (thrifted) and gave our adult kids the leftover ornaments for their trees. And then there's my outside \"tree\"- a branch blew off the tree, and I wanted to hang up my solar light. I decided to stuff it into the corner of the herb box. I added a red metal heart, now it's all ready! Kind of like a Charlie Brown Christmas tree, minus the green:)  Kind of Scandinavian almost...

For several years. Now I count my blessings all year, especially after going thru various job, medical and other stress this year. Yesterday I watched a mother of one of our students start crying after our school put together a huge food/gift box for her family. She was overwhelmed, and so thankful. I saw her crying and told her \"happy holidays\" and that she had a beautiful baby. I went back into my library and I cried. I remember so clearly being a single Mom with a young child a long time ago. I came home from work on a cold night in December and found the same thing- a huge food box with several gifts for my daughter, and a gift certificate for a ham or turkey. I cried. I still don't know who did that for me, but I was so very grateful. I told my daughter that that story again last night on her 28th birthday, and cried again. There really are angels among us.I'm having my 2nd cataract surgery the day before Christmas Eve and I'm happy! After looking thru a gray, hazy eye for the last several months I'm ready to see again. I'm also very grateful to have excellent insurance to help pay for it. Santa will come early, oh boy! Dave got a new job and is doing very,very well, so it's all good. Kids are ok too.  Oh, and I LOVE my Empress Anya cat. And my hens who are laying 3 eggs every day!  Thanks too to all my blogging pals and readers, I really am thankful for all the comments all year long!Amy Grant and CeCe WinansHAPPY HOLIDAYS TO YOU AND YOURS!!!"},

My New Fave Things", "date": "Dec 12, 2014", "text": "Annual Dark Days Challenge- I read about this in 2012 from a now defunct blog, the Urbanhennery. I do it every year, as best I can. Starting late this year , ah well! Here's how it goes~~~  Dates:The challenge runs from December 1st – April 15.What’s the Challenge?Try to cook four meals each month (1 per week) focused on sustainable, organic, and local ingredients. Whatever you can find is fine! Write about it on your blog (if you have one) or here in the comments section. Feel free to link back to me on your blog!What does local mean?Traditionally local food challenges call for a 100 mile radius, but winter is more difficult in many climates. If you’re new to eating locally try 150 miles. Typical exceptions are oils, coffee, chocolate and spices (unless you grow your own). What if I can’t find every ingredient locally?If you can’t find every ingredient, or even most ingredients, still try to do what you can. This is just as much about what we learn, the obstacles we find and the decisions we make as it is about cooking with mostly local ingredients. Do what you can, where you can.What if I don’t have a blog or photos?You are still welcome to participate! I'll try to post each week. Just you come by each week and add your meal/experiences as a comment. Take photos of what you’ve got, just do your best. No worries, keep it simple...Dinner tonight- our own fresh eggs (french baked), local bread, spinach-Yum, yum and so easy!Last month, 8\" of snow, then 4 degrees63 Degrees- In December!Yesterday was 61! This morning at 7:00 it was 61! Record high for this month, record snow last month and 4 degrees. What the heck month is this??? Freaky weather, the California \"pineapple express\" blew thru the last 2 days, windy and way too warm. Now the rain has finally started and temps are dropping, it's 41 right now. Back into the 40's for the high tomorrow and 30's at night. Pick a season already...My New Fave Things-Every year I get rid of more decorative things. Some go to our grown girls, the rest to charities. Then I buy a couple new items for something new. In the long haul I'm getting my stuff to much less items overall, and where I want it to be looks-wise. I'm going more and more for natural. I also get a lot of thrifted items, of course :) I like to put out mostly winter things this time of year, that way once the holiday tree is down I'm still good. I LOVE snow and winter! Take the bird above (and one below) new, about $2.00 at Michael's, nice heavy ceramic. I love birds for winter! I got several small things there 1/2 off...Bird #2  North woods Santa, how cute! Ditto 50% off, $7.00 I think...North woods tableMore birds (Target) and jar lamp ($4.00) from Michael'sAnya posing with my table runner I got last Jan., 80% off onlineAnd last, but SO not least- I found this guy (about 12\" high) in a thrift store last night, 1/2 off, for $2.50!!! Like new, what's not to love? I had been looking for something wintry lamp-wise for the top of a barn wood bookcase we have. It's on a timer and comes on at dark.

When I received it it had some tacky gold left/plastic leaves and gold balls. Hubby likes Advent, so I decided to upgrade it. I bought some picks for $4.00, and some small purple balls. I had some green paint already and painted the candle holders, and removed the tacky stuff. Baby Jesus don't do tacky! I did like the tiny gold balls and purple bows. \"before\" photosPicks and ballsDone...Anya's a ham!I added the picks and purple balls, now it looks much more full and natural. I like it! It shows how personalizing things make it much more meaningful. I added red apples for this old carol, Jesus Christ The Apple Tree that I have always loved. It's based on an old anonymous poem from the 1700's, just very lovely lyrics- The tree of life my soul hath seen, laden with fruit and always green:The trees of nature fruitless be compared with Christ the apple tree.His beauty doth all things excel: by faith I know, but ne'er can tellThe glory which I now can see in Jesus Christ the apple tree.For happiness I long have sought, and pleasure dearly I have bought:I missed of all; but now I see 'tis found in Christ the apple tree.I'm weary with my former toil, here I will sit and rest awhile:Under the shadow I will be, Of Jesus Christ the apple tree.This fruit doth make my soul to thrive, it keeps my dying faith alive;Which makes my soul in haste to be with Jesus Christ the apple tree."},

After a long, productive day of roasting, baking, eating and enjoying our family our extended (including 1 new boyfriend) and playing board games, I crashed! Today it's relax and enjoy the day. Being more of a voluntary simplicity, frugal/smart shopper gal, I skip the craziness. When I see throngs of people knocking each other down on the news I think it shows the worst side of Americans- greed. Really sad that people are that materialistic. I blogged about this 3 years ago, and I think it's just gotten worse- Materialism in America I also plan ahead! Most of my shopping is already done, long ago, and the few things I still need are easy to find. No worries. Why go crazy when you can relax? A Canadian friend of mine said their Thanksgiving is more of a harvest/Oktoberfest kind of thing- no shopping involved. Lucky her!Another Turkey-We were happy to be gifted with a free turkey from hubby's company. Since it was a 15 pounder (small) I qualified for a \"free\" turkey at the grocery store a few days ago. I grabbed one, a smaller 12 lb. one was a good size for us. I'm thawing it today for more leftovers and to freeze. Since I gave away most of the leftovers to the 3 girls, there' wasn't much left. On to round two! I'll thaw it today and roast it tomorrow. Here's a fast roasting method I found, which I'll try  Fastest Roast Turkey Looks great for general purposes... then more gravy, mashed taters and maybe dressing :) I made a flour-less chocolate almond tart instead of a pumpkin pie yesterday and everyone raved! I also made Indian Pudding, so there's some of that too :) Yum, yum...More Weather Changes-The weather was crazy-warm the last couple of days, 60 yesterday! I had the sliding glass door open late in the day in the kitchen. A few raindrops, but very mild. That's about to change. Dave was restless yesterday so I told him if he wanted to rake some leaves he had a good window yesterday. Rain and possible snow is on the way, with more normal cold weather after that. High tomorrow of 47, then next day high of 31! A 30 degree drop. The back to a more normal 40's/30's weather. It's so weird to see so many leaves still on the tree! We need a good windstorm, which may be starting to happen now. Breeze is picking up and leaves are coming down a bit. It was so mild early in the month, then 8\" of snow, and 4 degrees. We never had the normal leaf-falling weather. We always rake the leaves into the flower beds and then into the veggie garden. We did protect the plants, but the garden is still pretty empty. It's next. Fall leaves, come on already!!! Rain is coming on the radar, so hoping for some wind!"},

The snow came down hard and fast on top of the grass, so it never went dormant. Looks pretty weird with a lot of leaves still on the trees. The snow came so early in the year they never really fell. Well, they're falling now! A big wet mess. Hopefully when it dried up this next week we can get everything raked. I let the girls out earlier and the attacked the green grass! I always give them fresh greens when it's really cold- spinach mostly, which they love! I just gave them some grains and put them into the coop to dry out. Poor girls had very muddy feel. They seem to not mind the cold mud as much as my earlier chickens. They LOATHED wet feet. These 3, not so much.

Thankfully no wind at all. I was dressed in thick socks, a warm sweater and cord slacks at work. Toasty! Other people complained about the cold in very fashionable, thin clothes and warm weather shoes. Really? I guess you can't tell people- dress for the weather. And driving? The road has what I call crap snow- hard packed, icy s**t that's not level, but lumpy bumpy. Lots of fun to drive in to work :) The HIGH today was 14. It's supposed to warm up a bit over the next 3 days, with another 2\"- 4\" of snow Friday night. Once it hits the upper 30's this will hopefully melt.

{"title": "Near Record Rain, Wet Chickens, Eggs & More Winter Coop Prep, Dark Days Challenge Coming!", "date": "Nov 2, 2014", "text": "Near Record Rain-Cold and blue skies this morning! It absolutely POURED all day yesterday!!! Cold and very wet. We need the rain (being high desert) but it was a lot. I loved watching our new gutters actually work! Our old ones had leaked and rusted, so we bit the bullet and had new no-seam ones installed. Perfect. I had the croupy crud all week, so it was nice to just clean up the house, put away kitchen stuff, winterize the bed. I love snuggling into new flannel sheets, my fave comforter and cover. I bought an Ikea duvet cover a couple years ago that's bright yellow with white flowers on one side, and reverses on the other. In spring I flip it over. Nice and cheery in the winter-Dave took down most of our outside Halloween stuff (in the covered porch area) yesterday. I think he was bored. Today I'll do the inside. Turkeys will go up next weekend. I like to take a breath in between holidays, etc. I've never been the holidays way in advance kind of person. I'd get tired of looking at the stuff :)  But I do love thanksgiving more than most holidays, as it's much less commercial. And I'm shifting more to Yule celebrations. In the mean time here's a few shots of my fave spooky stuff-I love my prim raventhe Cheshire-type cat, I love it!my little thrifted prim catentry wayWet Chickens, Eggs & More Winter Coop Prep-We do our winter coop prep in stages, since the weather varies so much. The lower window was added a week or so ago, and the screen stored. Today I'll cover the door screen with plastic, and since the upper window opens we can adjust the ventilation easily. We'll add more shavings today, since the first 30 degree temp is supposed to hit tonight. Next weekend we'll add our \"sun room\" to the far left of the coop. It's a nice dry extra place, mostly glass. We could have really used it yesterday!Sometimes chickens just aren't the smartest critters, but they're finally laying!!! Two eggs every day! After 2 years I finally have eggs again. I can't figure out if one just isn't laying (we have 3) or they're rotating? Oh well. Yesterday it was pouring and I kept thinking they'd go inside. Nope. Early afternoon I lured them into the coop with treats and closed the door. They were really squawking an hour later, so I let them back out. An hour later I could see they were pretty wet, so I repeated. This time I left them in for the rest of the day. I don't want any cold, wet, sick birds. Since this was their first cold, wet storm maybe they just didn't know to go in? So- I helped them :) They'll love the sun room :)  I'm finally picking the last of the green tomatoes and making pesto, yummy!!!Dark Days Challenge Coming!I'll be starting this soon. I started doing this 2 years ago when I read about it at the Urbanhennery, a now (appears to be) defunct blog. It’s a challenge to continue cooking at least one local meal through the leaner days of winter. Your ingredients can come from your freezer, pantry, cold storage or local sources like farmers and other producers. I’m going to make a personal commitment to one meal a week. I’m also going to try to include others in our meals so our extended family can experience the pleasures of local foods, even in the dark days of winter. So here's the guidelines of the challenge, which I borrowed and modified slightly, feel free to do the same-Dates:The challenge runs from December 1st, 2012 – April 15, 2013 or so.What’s the Challenge?Try to cook four meals each month (1 per week) focused on sustainable, organic, and local ingredients. Whatever you can find is fine! Write about it on your blog, or here in the comments section when we start. Feel free to link back to me on your blog if you have one!What does local mean?Traditionally local food challenges call for a 100 mile radius, but winter is more difficult in many climates. If you’re new to eating locally try 50 miles. Typical exceptions are oils, coffee, chocolate and spices. What if I can’t find every ingredient locally?If you can’t find every ingredient, or even most ingredients, just do what you can. This is just as much about what we learn, the obstacles we find and the decisions as it is about cooking with local ingredients. Do what you can, where you can.I'll add a button, if if I can remember how to do it, so you can join along :)"},

Winter comes on fast sometimes- 75 on Thursday, 30 forecast tomorrow night. The pink on the map below shows our first winter storms coming in the mountains. That means winter is settling in.

This time I used ciabatta rolls and added roasted red peppers. I served with it our ripe tomatoes, green beans and basil from the garden. Home canned nectarines on the side. I had my first ever Cherokee Purple tomatoes. Interesting flavor, very mild and light on the acid. Good for a chilly night... Since we're getting 2 eggs a day (finally) I made a big garden frittata last night. Oh my, the eggs and cheese were heavenly! Tonite I made a big nectarine crumble. Great stuff!"},

After reading this Myhumblekitchen.com I thought I'd giver it a try. Lots of great vitamins and minerals, perfect for winter! I used one large bunch of Swiss chard, one bunch of kale, 1 thin sliced carrot, 1 large red onion, water and salt. That made two batches- one 1/2 gallon jar and one fermenting jar size, about 1 1/2 Qts. Just chop, alternate layers of veggies, smash down a bit. Very fast and easy! Now everything is fermenting away! Looks good! The hens really attacked the left over chard, and kale.Some Anya fall cats naps-And a fall breakfast- homemade banana bread w/pecans and Earl Grey teaLove the chicken mug!Herbs dryingWinter is Closing In-With freeze warnings to the west and east of us, it's easy to see winter is on it's way! This is the time of year I watch the weather forecasts closely. I'm a weather geek, I'm always worry about my last tomatoes freezing and losing them! While it's been in the mild 60's-70's (with more next week) during the day we're slipping into high 30's/40's at night. I saw the first frost at work 2 days ago. Leaves are changing color and falling, grass growth slowing/less watering, turning on the heater in the car. Time to prep! Here's the kinds of things we've been doing- took off the front screen door and put up the storm door, replaced the furnace filter, caulked some windows, I whacked back tomatoes for faster ripening, ripped out the rest of the veggies, cleaned up the veggie beds, harvested all my herbs. I'll be making pesto to freeze this week, yummy! Stocked up on teas! I spent some time yesterday pulling out the hot weather clothes out of my closet and replaced them with most of the winter clothes. When I do that I also pull out some of those for donations, off they go! Dave did the same. I also think about if we need to mini-winterize the cars at all? I always put an ice scraper, blanket and extra gloves/hat for the back seat of both cars. Since we keep our cars pretty well maintained it's not really a big deal. We'll be getting the coop set up soon. We built into the design, with recycled materials, a glass bottom \"storm window\" on the coop. In the warm weather it's hardware cloth, in the cold it's glass. We just slide the one out and the new in! Lets in light, but not wind, less cold. We provide good ventilation in the winter (and monitor that), but cover some openings. We've already added more pine shavings to warm things up a bit. The waterer heater has been moved in and is ready, the extra waterers put away. We use a 1 gallon in the winter, a 3 gallon (plus 2 more in the garden) in the hot weather. Anya has taken to laying on top of the heating vents, a nice warm kitty spot! Soon we'll add the \"sun room\", of the far left, a nice sheltered spot during the really cold/wet/snowy weather!

The whole rent to own thing, I think, is a lack of education and the need for instant gratification. Most Americans are good at that. The media applauds it. My husband and I really taught our kids about finances while they were still in high school, and really warned them about credit card debt in college. I wish someone had taught me at that age! While, on the surface, people might very us as very middle class I buy most of my clothes, home decor, mics. stuff at thrift stores. I buy a lot of groceries at the \"grocery outlet\", can, dry, and raise as much produce as we can squeeze in. We'll expand to the front yard next spring. We paid cash for big ticket items like our couch and bed and bought quality so they will last (and protect our backs). We also sell things on Craigslist and eBay that we don't use. We refurbish/repair items rather than replace them. We just live differently than the \"average American\". And happy to do so.I think there really can be a poverty \"attitude\", with helplessness and victimization about it. I grew up poor, not enough to eat, was made fun of, blah blah blah. It was pretty much my Mom's fault as far as her mismanagement, addiction, whatever. I used to think of myself as a victim of that, but I know see it's what's gotten me where I am. I am a survivor and so what if things were tough? I have moved on. While there's still a certain amount of inner damage life's too short. But I digress... I think one of the problems is the concept of \"keeping up with the Joneses\"- I can't wait, it needs to be new mentality.Quote from Americas Real Problem is With Spiritual Poverty - \"For one, material well-being isn't enough for human beings to be happy. People require a sense of belonging, a sense of community, and a sense of their own value. They want to know their life has meaning and purpose, that the future will better, that their lives have dignity and worth. For many in society's lowest quintile, their material needs are taken care of, but these other needs are not.\" Good point.I did something rare yesterday- I went into  regular retail store to buy 2 sweaters (half off) and a pair of slacks for work. I do this about once a year, unlike most. It was really interesting to see everyone else in their normal \"shopping\" mode! Screaming kids, snappy parents, people texting. At the register I was asked- \"do you want to apply for a credit card, get 20% off!\". Then- \"do you want a rewards card?\". I said \"I'd just like to pay for my purchase and go\". I was polite but firm. Get me outta here! It's a real racket- buy more, save more, use more plastic and even more emails! No thanks. I left...I wish there was an easy answer to some peoples view of poverty and what that even means? On a spiritual level it's a different story from my perspective. Maybe people feel cut off from their source or whatever you want to call it? Maybe people feel less than emotionally, so buying something makes them feel more \"normal\"? Maybe we are just brainwashed by the media to be consumers, and not producers? Buy more stuff, don't reduce/build/grow/sell/preserve/eat it. Just buy. Maybe the best thing we can do is do what we can, where we are..."},

I get so frustrated reading all the excuses people make for sticking their child in front of a screen. It's \"educational\" therefor it's ok. Parenting is exhausting no doubt, but that's what you signed up for. And there's things like babysitters, and child care swap friends! If you want an easy, restful life, don't have kids. Not everyone is cut out for it. I see first hand every day the trouble with getting kids hooked on devices. I had to explain to a 6th grader recently that ebook aren't always a good idea, that batteries can fail, wireless can fail, devices crash. She just didn't get it. With no power you just have an expensive piece of plastic, a nice paperweight. A Special Ed teacher told me years ago that the \"baby Einstein\" kids would probably all become ADHD over time. That was what the scientific research showed. Great. You want your kids to be smarter and you wind up with a damaged child. But someone made some $$$. I read a post recently that really brought together all the bad reasons why young kids shouldn't be using technology, or much of it at all. As a very busy Mom who worked full time and raised 3 verybright kids, and is VERY techy, I would say there's all kinds of problems there.Scientists have been warning for severalyears about the damage done to the wiring of young kid’s brains by putting them infront of TVs, Ipads, devices. Not tomention the radiation coming off the devices. 10 Reasons Why Devices Should Be Banned For Kids Under 12  by The American Academy of Pediatrics and the Canadian Society of Pediatrics. Educators are seeing this too (I’m one). Kids with no patience, glued to screens and not interacting with people, lack of social skills, etc. I read people are putting their kids in bed to chill with a device, never a good idea. No child should ever be alone with tech. As a tech support person I know that technology can fail, devices can overheat, stuff happens. Our Roku2 had to go back to the store a while back, as it was so hot it almost melted. Could have started a fire. Kids should be able to go relax or go to sleep with a night light, a book, a stuffed animal, and someone who loves them. Kids can do this really strange thing and go outside and run around! It doesn't take much to take 10 minutes and read a book to your child, sing to them and hold them to help them relax. Relaxing music is wonderful too- have them close their eyes and think about what the music would look like? Use their imagination! It’s just so much better to cuddle a person than a piece of plastic. They’ll have plenty of time to be techy later, and then they are all done with the cuddling stage.

They are so good dead ripe :) No apples this year, and about 10 pears on our baby pear tree. I may buy some apples to can for applesauce. I make mine chunky with lots of spices. Great in the winter with pork or for breakfast. Buying summer grilling meat and freezing for winter.4. Manage Reserves- Get a Good Deal/Barter/Stock Up/Prep-Still stocking up the pantry on a regular basis. I bought some small, canned hams, for soups, etc. Still freezing local, artisan, organic breads from the outlet. We may do a pick-your-own apples, if it's not too far away.5. Eat the Food- Try New Foods/Recipe-Kale salads, fermented pickles. Using some of the meats in the freezer to make room for nectarines. Made some sausage with sauteed garden veggies, yummy!6. Build Community Food Systems- Neighbor may have some rhubarb she gives us, the rural farmer's market is just too far away to buy much. The downtown version is too overpriced for me. 7. Recycle/Re-Use-Cleaned coop. spread shavings into the garden. Bought an old window for a chicken wire display. Will get it together in the next week. Bought a like-new used bathroom cabinet for $5.00 at the Habitat Store. Dave hung it today for me. Perfect for a little decor, with some beachy stuff leftover from our main bathroom remodel. I knew I'd find a spot for it somewhere... 8. Skill Up- Learned how to install an antenna watching Dave.9. Regenerate What is Lost/Salvage Something-Dishwasher quit, so Dave pulled it, and did some diagnosing. We loaded it into the wagon and took it to a reliable repair guy we've used before. We think they can repair it. A new one would be several hundred dollars. I have told Dave to just use the extra space for shelves, but I think he's afraid he'd be doing dishes the rest of his life! :)Setting Up An Outdoor TV Antenna-We had been using Dish with HBO for a while. At one point we had cable, but then Dish was cheaper so we switched. Since we rarely go to movies it was good deal at the time. We started thinking about switching to Netflix, since there's so much more variety, and it's so much cheaper- $8.99 a month. ***Dish would be wise to come up with some GOOD packages that are cheaper. We had one up from the bottom, and the low price one was mostly junk channels. No History, A&e, TNT, etc.*** So... first we ditched HBO a few months ago, after the Game of Thrones finale :) We got Netflix after that, easy to install with our wireless and a Roku 2. We started looking around for an outdoor antenna and got this Antenna at Best Buy. Since we're in the middle of town we knew we'd get a strong signal. Long story short, Dave and I spent a lot of time (hours) trying to get a clear signal from the roof. We'd get some stations, but not others. FINALLY Dave realized he was trying to use the OLD cable. Off to the store. New cable. Problem solved! Clear as a bell!!! AND we gained 4 PBS channels instead of 1! Note to self- do a clean install with new cable, not 10-20 year old cable. It may LOOK ok, but it's the guts that count. Cancelled Dish, more $$$ in our pockets. And I LOVE Netflix, catching up on the old Haven episodes from the Syfy series, the only decent series left IMO.... Better shot of the antenna-Better shot of the antennaA Little Early Halloween For Work-Being an elementary librarian I HAD to but this little guy for $5.00 online.

{"title": "Vintage Kitchen Chicken Wire Window Display, Change in The Weather", "date": "Aug 30, 2014", "text": "Vintage Kitchen Chicken Wire Window Display-Dave and I went up for the afternoon to Idaho City to our favorite little lunch place. We have tried for years to go into a little junk shop, but it was always closed. Not today! The photo above is the cute kitchen tools on chicken wire display on top of a vintage window frame. They stripped it down to bare wood, not my thing. I like chippy paint!!! I have been wanting to re-display my vintage green wood handled kitchen tools. I wanted something bigger to make more impact, rather than having them scattered all around the kitchen. Most of them are from the 1920's/30's. On the way home I found a similar sized old window for $7.00 at a Habitat-like store. We broke and disposed of the glass, and Dave got out out spare chicken wire. I'll be making the same thing, but will leave the chippy paint on the window. Watch the upcoming redo! Earlier today I found a like-new small bathroom wall storage cabinet for $5.00 at the Habitat Store, for my small bathroom. It needs a little something! So today was my day of great ideas! Ironically I didn't buy anything in the store I'd been waiting years to shop at, but at least I got a good display idea....Change in The Weather-I'm sitting here listening to 45+ mph winds, always a bit nerve-racking. I always worry about a huge branch coming down from our beloved backyard maple tree. So far, so good. I know the storm was coming, and we could see the clouds accumulating on our way home from the mountains. I LOVE the rain, and right now is blowing sideways across the street. Rain baby, bring it on! Chickens are all safley tucked in for the night, and I prepped the yard. I'll check my rain barrel in the morning :) It's starting to feel  bit like Fall with the cooler weather, shorter days, and storms starting to blow thru. I love the fall weather when it's a nice 65-75 degrees and sunny, then colder at night. Perfect outside weather for me... What's it doing where you live???"},

Back To Work, At-Home Treatment of Sick Chickens, A Perfect Salad", "date": "Aug 16, 2014", "text": "From Ktvb.com weatherFinally Some Major Rain!!!-We have had a lot of \"split storms\" in Boise recently The way things are laid out here, we get a lot of storms that make a V in the valley. When they hit here they tend to split to the west and east and miss the middle of the Boise valley. Where I live. It stinks. Lots of rain in the mountains, foothills, east to Twin Falls, west to Oregon. Zippo here. It has been so dry and smoky here! Finally on Wed. we had a little rain in the morning, and a major thunderstorm came into town about 6 p.m. Lots of much-needed rain was expected in those few minutes, but we only had about 15 minutes worth. BUT in the middle of the night we awoke (about 12:30, I was sound asleep!) to a MAJOR thunderstorm, with tons of lightning, and a long lasting downpour. It even shook the windows. Happily it also filled up my 55 gallon rain barrel:) The air smells really wonderful since then, with deep blue skies. I'm sure this helped with the forest fires.  I checked with the news and we received between 1/2\" and 3/4\" inch of rain. It was such a great relief, settled the smoke, pollen and gave everything a good drink!!! We haven't had to water since then...Back To Work-Sadly my stay-at-home summer is coming to an end. I'm back to \"work\" on Monday. I've gotten lots of projects done this summer- deep cleaning closets, eBaying/Craigslisting extra items, painting, gardening, thrifting, you name it. I still see all the undone projects, but I have to remind myself there are these things called weekends! While I am extremely grateful for being employed, and all the benefits that go with it, it's a very stressful work environment. I work with about 85% high poverty kids, which gives me a very complicated student body to work with. Lots of behavior management, in a kind way:) Anyway, it's back to school for me. You'll see a few less posts, but I'm thinking about y'all!!! And wishing I were home. Let's see there's canning coming up, freezing, drying.....At-Home Treatment of Sick Chickens-I've written about my Chicken Hospital set up before, and I had to set it up again this week. I went out Thursday morning to find a droopy combed, very lethargic chicken. Ellie, my sweet old retired hen. I've never seen a droopy comb before, and her coloring on her comb was off too, purplish. She seemed fine the day before. I brought her in and treated her for worms, and hydrated her. Worms are a common culprit here. I wormed the whole flock. Yesterday morning she was wheezing a bit so I suspected an infection. I had Tetroxy HCA-280 soluble powder on hand, but she wasn't drinking much. She's ate yogurt with wormer, but was still really droopy. I kept her inside the rest of the day. She's a real sweetheart so I hoped to be able to pull her through. I got her to eat some soft bread yesterday morning, then I gave her some watery homemade applesauce with the Tetroxy, and more later, which she ate. I washed her bum for good measure:)  I brought her in last night, repeated and focused more on the antibiotics. She seemed a little perked up. I just didn't want her to get more dehydrated. Today....She's much better! This morning when I went out she was much perkier, tails up, alert. I brought her in again, since she's been out (it's mild) and she gobbled up her sauce. I gave her more diluted, homemade applesauce with Tetroxy, with some rolled oats. Comb's still a bit down, but that's ok. Long live the Internet! I get so many free resources there, and it's great in an emergency. I now keep a full-blown emergency chicken kit on hand. Good to have since things can happen quickly, can't afford vet bills, and stores might be closed. Here's a good article if you're scratching your head what to do for your birds- Caring For a Sick Or Injured Chicken Ellie free ranged a bit this morning after her meds, and she was much more alert and curious.

We decided not to go to Yellowstone or the Tetons, since we were late in planning. I found a nice, cheap motel in Bellevue, below Hailey and Ketchum. The great thing is Hailey, much of what Bruce Willis has owned, is the incredible, low cost food places to eat. Think grass fed beef burgers on brioche rolls, with organic veggies at the Power House Pub & Bike Store  Yum! And only $10.00, that would be cheap for Boise. Dave loved the HUGE beer selection! We had breakfast at Shorty's Diner, a fun 50's style place. Willis owns that building too.Ketchum is the very expensive, somewhat snobby ski area. Lots of mega-mansions up there, and too many golf courses to count. By contrast we've gone to McCall, a resort area, and there's no snobbish behavior from what we've seen. Very relaxed. We went to 2 museums, both closed for some unknown reason. The really cool thing we did was to take a gondola up to 7,000 feet, on Bald Mountain, for lunch! It was a gorgeous ride, but a bit hazy from forest fire smoke. We ate out on the deck (sorry no pics) and had gourmet sandwiches, and relaxed. The Roundhouse interior was really gorgeous, built in the 20's. I love the mountain theme-Roundhouse deckI want that sled table!!!I always try to buy a little something from a special trip. I found this recycled-glass sun catcher for $10.00 in Ketchum, gorgeous purple/blue...Using Trip Advisor-One of the things I love is doing research before any kind of travel. I use Tripadvisor! Since we travel rarely, and on a very tight budget, we need more bang for the buck. We've found low cost, reliable motels, meals, and other excursions on it. I also write reviews after we go to some of those places. I highly recommend it!Harvesting Veggies-We're finally getting a steady supply of tomatoes: yellow, plum, cherry and some Early Girls. Peppers seem to be late all over the valley, must be the heat. I know fruit won't set on tomatoes if it's over 85 or 90. Maybe peppers too? Yellow squash are coming, pickling cukes, and lots more blackberries! I won the battle of the Swiss Chard! After planting and covering with bird netting, I have a good crop!!!Twin Falls, IdahoNo Rain, Again-While we have had lots of thunder heads, and heat, we've had zero rain. Yesterday the rain that bypassed us went east to Twin Falls. We really need some rain, to help rid us of the smokey skies. The lightning has been pretty bad lately, sparking small fires up in the hills and mountains nearby. I have heard at least 6 NIFC planes overhead the last hour. We saw one of these yesterday near McCall-Used for moving water, had a tube on it, from Sikorsky S-64 SkycraneLemon Scones & Blackberries-I made some quick lemon scones, added our dead-ripe blackberries, with some leftover lemon curd for an amazing quick dessert.

Then one day you have one of those \"what was I thinking?\" moments? I did. My kitchen counter wasn't too messy, but a bit cluttered looking, and in need of reorganizing. This week I was looking at some various organizing ideas for one of our bedroom, then stumbled on to lots kitchen counters ideas. They jumped out at me! Hey, why was my toaster clear across the kitchen away from the food prep area? And the bread box? Hmmm... got me thinking. The short version- I looked more closely at what really gets used daily, and what doesn't. While some have a system of having empty counters, it's a bit to stark for my tastes. Here's what I did, yes it's my kitchen! I know, you've never seen it before :) I hope you like it!First I took everything off, and wiped down and cleaned, then made piles.I decided what I really needed to be out. It didn't take too long to decide. Then I moved things closer to where they should be. So...Toaster and breadbox moved closer to the food prep areaCutting board off the counter, behind the sinkCreated a fermenting station, since I do Water Kefir and am now doing veggies. I put the electric can opener in the cupboard. I use one because of some arthritis in my hands, but only once or twice a week, so why have it out?I put the hot and cold teas in a new little rack I found at Costco, perfect timing! They are 2 for $16.00, all bamboo, with little removable brackets. Perfect size for the teas. I my get some more for another part of the house. Something similar somewhere else was twice the price.Moved the decorative bin over, to make room for the bread box.Done! So this is the \"after version\". It may not make Better Home Gardens but it works for me. Now if I could just get new, solid counters!!! Sigh, someday.Fermenting station to the right, on the far left before I bought my bamboo organizerBamboo organizer now in far right cornerHot teas on top, cold on the bottom, cutethe clips are removable and you can use individuallyI had hoped to find something like this for under the upper cabinet, but they aren't sold thru Etsy anymore. I may make some to sell :) History of RV's & A Truly Off Road RV-There's a fascinating look at the history of RV's here Living In Rvs Vs.Tiny Houses! I would add to that info- a lot of RV materials are unhealthy. Off gassing formaldehyde, poor ventilation, a lot of plastics. This came up with people living full time in RVs after Katrina. People started getting sick. I've also seen RV's being built in films and it's all about speed, not quality. Very cheaply made, structurally speaking. It's really the opposite of well-crafted tiny houses. My biggest problem, with either, is that very few people seem to be into self sufficiency, growing their own foods and storing it. They are completely dependent on city/county utilities and buy almost all of their foods. There's no real storage. This is most of what I've read, and I'm sure there are exceptions. Not my thing, here's my thing- Mercedes Benz Zetros  a truly off-road RV. I would do this Mercedes Benz Zetros tricked out with solar, and water making capabilities as well, and a nicer paint job :) Sounds like the way to go! There are very little truly off-grid RVs I've seen for sale. Most are heavily modified by owners. Now if I just had the $$$ for a Zetros! This baby will take you anywhere!!! Some say though, the only way to be truly zombie proof is by sea. Hmmm, I know how to sail!100 Day Pantry Cookbook-I had spotted this book somewhere, and decided to order a used copy. It's here 100 Day Pantry Quick Gourmet Meals  While I love fresh foods like anyone else, there's all kind of reasons you might want to think about all the \"what ifs?\" There's no water needed for any of these recipes, a real bonus. Most of the ingredients are pretty commonly available, but it make you think about things? Dried celery, nope I don't have any. Should I? Some of this is also not very healthy, but probably okay in a pinch. Jars of cheese? OMG the sodium and fat, ew. Anyway, there's some pretty good recipes complied, and for $7.00 it's in my stash. It's always good to have a quick reference if things go bad, in a hurry... or you're just exhausted for another day at work/home!A little something over my kitchen sink :)"},

Not So Much Chokecherries", "date": "Jul 29, 2014", "text": "What a nice coupleGoodbye Fiona- I Mean Fred-Well you know how it goes- the hatchery gave me two pullets, and one's a roo. When I saw the larger comb and wattles developing I knew I was in trouble. Sad thing is he's a really sweet little guy, loved to cuddle, easy to handle and loves treats. I REALLY want to keep him, but no roos in the city. He also tried mounting one of the girls, Gwyn, last night. Ew, I'm done. I've already cried over this, but it's the way it is. I placed a posting in Backyard Chickens, but no one would take him. So last night he went on Craigslist. I hate to do it, but I don't have much recourse. He's just starting to get some amber and light brown in his feathers, and should be quite handsome! I'd really like him to go into a small flock, and for someone to keep him. Here's hoping... Lesson learned, no more \"feather sexed\" birds for me :(  Glad I bought four total, 3 different breeds. I was hoping to get my flock up to six laying eggs, but I'll wait until next spring...Homemade Non-Toxic Ant Spray-After seeing a small line of ants coming in near my back sliding glass door near my kitchen I panicked. I do NOT want ants in the house! I did some research and made a quick batch of homemade spray. I used the following, and put in a 1 Qt. empty spray bottle-mix 1/2 water to 1/2 vinegar,add 2 squirts of dish washing soapShake well. Spray well on all visible ants. Kills 'em good, drowning the guys, not too much odor. I also put out some indoor traps, but I was able to get the majority of the with this spray. Cheap and effective....Tons Of Blackberries!!!-The last 2 years we had a light harvest on our organic blackberries. This year, score! I picked 1 Qt. last night and they were dead ripe. All gone today :) Superb with good vanilla ice cream and on cereal. We can get quite a lot from a small area. We have 2 rows, about 4' high and 4' long, about 2 ' apart. There's another good Qt. there now, so I'll pick more tomorrow. I love to bake with them, and freeze some for winter baking. They are SO sweet! Worth all the scratches. I did minimize the scratches by trimming off any empty canes, with zero fruit. Makes it much easier... Yum, yum... Not So Much Chokecherries-This year I got a pretty small batch of chokecherries. I picked about 2 cups, which yielded about 4 1/2 of my small, mini jars. These jars are great for really small batches. I just water can them on the stove top. The flavor is the best jelly I've ever had and it's a very unique flavor. Everyone who's tried it, and most have never had it, love it. It's tart and citrusy. As sour as the cherries are, you still add lemon juice to the recipe. It seems counter-intuitive, but it works. Luckily I have several jars from last year! Dave and I did a major trim of it this weekend, hopefully that will boost production. Also trimmed the lilac that was creating too much shade for it. I never know what creates a \"good\" year or \"bad\", ah well...."},

Chop tarragon and mix with oil, in a small bowl. Crush it into the oil. Mix vinegar with oil, and dried tarragon, and add to the cheese. I used a large spoon to break up the big chunks.

I found this recipe Quick Refrigerator Pickles and decided to try it. I did use classic pickling spice instead of just 2 spices. I also added 1 tsp. of black tea leaves for crunch, 1 bay leaf, and a pinch of red pepper flakes. It was SO much FASTER! I had 4 QTs. done in 15 minutes and the kitchen is cool! I'll let you know how the flavor is in a week :)  If I can wait that long!!!

I'm a Master Gardener, so I looked at it as a blank canvas. Here's a description for you to visualize...The front was turf, no trees, only 2 shrubs over by the fence to the right. NOTHING ELSE. Empty beds, just dirt. The fencing was also falling over, so we replaced that front and back. Dave and I build it together:) We have planted everything else in 7 years. Most if the first 2. Now there are....Three fruit trees, shrubs, perennial flowers, herbs, ground covers, grasses, berries, cherries, and medicinal plants. We also planted a Sumac tree, a memorial for Dave's Mom. I learned later that I can make wonderful lemonade from the berries. You can also dry them for lemony seasoning for fish, etc. Who knew?I intentionally planted lots of pollinators. We qualified here, as did our last house, as a National Wildlife Federation Backyard Habitat.

I fired up the charcoal barbecue, and got it nice and hot. They sizzled, then I stood back and enjoyed the show. I  used a meat thermometer to watch the temp, and they were a nice medium when done. I added some roasted \"steakhouse\" taters from the oven with olive oil and salt. I bought them at Costco- purple, yellow and dark tan.

Slightly spicy, and very tangy...My First- Fermenting- I bought a 1/2 gallon fermenting jar kit, with an airlock lid, to get me started fermenting. I know you don't need one, but I was buying water kefir grains anyway, so what the hay. I bought mine here- Culturesforhealth.com The photo is incorrect and shows a 1 gallon, not the 1/2. I used their recipe and modified it a bit, and here we go!You can see the ceramic weighting ring, keeps things submerged. Ready to go!The airlock releases the gas.I had more cukes than I needed so I used a recipe here for simple fermenting Myhumblekitchen and made 2 jars the old fashioned way, burping required. I thought I'll do a taste test when they're all done!Grow baby grow! They're in a dark, cool place doing their thing...   How adorable!A Flock You Have To See!I saw these on Bornambitous-Bornimaginative, and they are so dang cute! She always has great photos of her kids and her place. She's doing a giveaway, so check them out! They come with a nest box, egg, and birth certificate. For those discriminating flock owners :)"},

Handsome Young Man Needs Home-I know a few of my readers are from my area, so I thought I'd post this. Well you know how it goes- the hatchery gave me 2 pullets, and 1's a roo. Here's Fiona, or Fred, as we now call him. He's a really sweet little guy, about 3/4 months or so old. I bought in in early May, I think he was 2-3 weeks old. He's easy to handle and loves treats. He growing well and very healthy. I REALLY want to keep him, but no roos in the city. My birds are very clean and well cared for in a large urban coop with run. He's just starting to get some amber and light brown in his feathers, and should be quite handsome! I'd really like him to go into a small flock, and for someone to keep him. So if you are looking for a 4H project, a nice boy for your hens, please contact me and we will set up a pick up. No dinner chickens here please. Adults will have different color variations, but will tend to be white/brown/tan. Please email if you have any questions? He's ready for pick up any time... Thanks, Nancy"},

It's wonderful! Almost a cross between cheesecake and custard. Very cheesy and almost chewy filling. Not too sweet either. The berries were great with it. When our blackberries ripen I may try that instead. It's a fast recipe too- just mix everything together, whisk and pour. With the hot weather I put it in the fridge to cool, after a bit, to finish it off. I used a 1 lb. of berries on the top.Baked in a deep dish pie dishButtermilk Pie with Fresh Strawberries (from Vegetarian Times)3 large eggs1 cup minus 2 tbsp sugar3 tbsp AP flour1 ¾ cups buttermilk2 tbsp unsalted butter, melted1 tsp vanilla extract1/8 tsp grated or ground nutmeg (I used a bit more)1 9-inch store-bought crust2 pints strawberries, hulled and halved1. Preheat oven to 350F2. Whisk together eggs, sugar and flour in large bowl.  Add buttermilk and butter, whisk until combined.  Stir in vanilla extract and nutmeg.  Pour buttermilk mixture into crust, and bake 40 minutes, or until toothpick inserted into center comes out clean.  Cool completely.3. Place strawberry halves in concentric circles on top of pie, with wide stem ends facing outward, and serve.I found some other useful info. I'm tired of buying buttermilk (it's really \"clabbered milk\"), and I found I can make my own, as needed! Much cheaper too :) You can do the same for sour cream. Since I don't have my own dairy you can use store bought milks. Recipes are here, from a class I took-Buttermilk:Buttermilk is made with a 1-to-3 ratio of cultured buttermilk to regular milk.  So, if you want a cup of buttermilk, mix ¼ cup buttermilk with ¾ cup milk; for a quart, mix 1 cup buttermilk with 3 cups milk.  Cover the container and let sit at room temperature (preferably between 70°F and 75°F) for about 24 hours. When finished, the cultured milk should coat the container (or back of a spoon).  Refrigerate.  Buttermilk can be perpetuated indefinitely—just remember to make new buttermilk with your old supply within about 2-3 weeks, and you should be fine.Sour Cream:Sour cream is made with cultured buttermilk and cream, at a rate of about 1-2 tbsp buttermilk per cup of cream (you can experiment here to achieve your preferred tartness and firmness).  Mix the desired amounts together, cover the container and let sit at room temperature for 24-48 hours, checking after 24 hours, and then refrigerate.  Deciding when sour cream is done takes a bit of experience, as sour cream mellows considerably (as well as firms up quite a bit) once it’s been refrigerated.  So, a sour cream that tastes very tart indeed on the counter might give you a very nice, subtle sour cream once cooled.  Experiment to see what you like.How To Wash No-Wash Woven Wool Rugs-I have  nice Nate Berkus Target wool runner rug. I bought it at Goodwill for $10.00. It's perfect in our heavy traffic entry way. I vacuum it every week, but I knew it was just dirty. With chocolate brown, it didn't show. I did some research on how to wash it without damaging it. I took a risk and it worked! Here's how I did it-vacuum rug, both sides. Take outside o hot day, and lay out on your deck. You could do this on a clean sidewalk also. Spray down both sides with a cold hose on the blast setting. Do both sides. Then I sprayed on some 7th Generation all purpose cleaner. I wanted something mild, no dish detergent to strip the wool. Spray all over, then blast again til all the bubbles are gone. Flip over do again. Leave overnight in the shade. I moved it and flipped it several times when it started drying. Total dry time was about a day and 1/2, and it was 100 here. It's MUCH cleaner and no shrinkage!!! I think the trick was- handle as little as possible, use cold water, and leave flat to dry.rug weaveAll clean and dry!!!        Mother Abigail's Home\"The Stand\" Movie Kitchen-I was watching \"The Stand\" lats night and I love Mother Abigail's character.

Wow, there's a lot out there in cyber land! I found the food section in this very useful- Zero to Prepared- Fast, Simple & Low Cost  I was already doing \"copy canning\" I just didn't know it was called that. I moved things around, re-did some locations, checked what I had and did some shopping today. My weak spot had been veggies and pastas.

I've heard about food fatigue, where people will simply stop eating out of the sheer boredom of subsisting off few foods. Not a good idea. When you hear certain groups promoting storing only a few foods, branch out! I have wheat, and flour, but I also have: buckwheat grouts, rolled & steel cut oats,  rices, spelt, cornmeal. You can make a lot of different things out of that. Keep lots of spices, condiments, jams, jellies (I can a lot of my own). Think different combos! Be creative and plan ahead..."},

I hadn't heard of it. Here's the idea-try to not use any single-use plastic item for the month. How would you do that? I buy a lot of thing bulks, but then what do you do with the plastic bags? We use them for kitty box cleaning, so dual use :)  What could you do? Please post ideas if you have them??? Here's just a few ideas from their website-  Plasticfreejuly Living Plastic Free :Plastic Free Food Storage-Choose glass or stainless steel food storage containers.Wrap sandwiches in fabric or place in paper bags.Use what you have.Save your glass jars and bottles for purchasing bulk food and for storing leftovers.Store leftovers in a bowl with plate over the top instead of using plastic wrap.If you have plastic containers in the cupboard - use them.Store vegetables in reused plastic bags, wrapped in damp tea towels or glass pyrex container.Herbs keep well in a slightly damp tea towel in a glass container.Wrap cheese in an old linen tea towel.Freeze leftovers in heat stable glass containers like pyrex.Use a clean shower cap to cover a bowl.Line rubbish bin with several layers of newspaper.Make your own fabric bowl covers.Top Tips: At the ShopsAsk the butcher / deli / fishmonger to wrap meats straight in paper if you don't have your own containers.Buy fresh bread in paper bags (if you don't have your own bread bag).Buy fresh vegetables (some stores and co-ops deliver boxes of fruit and veggies).Buy nuts, dried fruit, flour, legumes, coffee, rice, oats etc from bulk bins.Choose items in glass.Choose wine with natural corks.Give up chewing gum (read about plastic in chewing gum at My Plastic Life).Shop at your local farmers market.Consider buying commonly used items such as oats, flour and rice in bulk and share with friends (bag sizes usually range in size from 5-25 kg and come in calico or reinforced paper bags).Plastic-Free Cleaning, Make Your Own-There is really no need to purchase ‘wonder’ pre-packaged cleaning products. Try making your own with products you can buy in bulk, and usually in cardboard. You've probably got all the ingredients in your cupboard. All purpose cleaner: Fill an old spray bottle with vinegar and water. 1 part vinegar to 3 parts water.All purpose disinfectant: Fill an old spray bottle with 3 cups of hot water, 3 teaspoons of borax and 10 drops of eucalyptus, lemon or lavender oil.Clean a burnt fry pan: Fill pan with a layer of water, add 1 cup of vinegar, bring to boil. Remove from heat and add 2 tablespoons of baking soda (note: it will fizz). Empty the pan and scoure.Clean microwaves: Combine 1/4 cup of vinegar and 1 cup water in a microwavable container. Boil mixture for 3 mins. Let it stand in microwave for 10 mins. Wipe inside of microwave with a damp cloth.Clean mirrors: Pour a little vinegar onto a scrunched up sheet of newspaper and wipe mirror. Dry with a clean sheet of newspaper.Clean toilets: Sprinkle bicarb / baking soda into the bowl. Rinse with vinegar and scrub.Cleaning rags: Instead of buying cleaning rags wrapped in plastic recycle old towels, flannels and sheets that are well passed their used-by date. Cut them up, use, then wash!Descale your kettle: Half fill the kettle with water, drop a couple of slices of lemon and boil. Repeat once. Dry with a cloth.Fabric softener: Add one cup of white vinegar during the rinse cycle.Make your drinking glasses shine: Soak in a solution of vinegar and water. Dry with a cloth.Remove rust (from tins): Rub with a peeled potato dipped in bicarb / baking soda or salt.Remove rust (from cutlery): Polish cutlery with a paste of bicarb / baking soda and vinegar.Remove soap scum from a shower screen (1): Fill an old spray bottle with vinegar and spay the screen. Leave for 3-5 mins then wipe with a clean towel, scrubbing lightly.Remove soap scum from a shower screen (2): For stubborn screen stains squeeze some homemade toothpaste onto a sponge and scrub.Soak and whiten nappies: Dissolve 1/4 cup of bicarb / baking soda in warm water. Soak overnight. Wash nappies as normal.Unblock a drain: Pour 1/3 cup of bicarb / baking soda into drain followed by 1 cup of white vinegar. Immediately seal the drain with the plug. Leave 1 hour and pour boiling water down the drain.Washing dishes by hand: Add 4 tbs of baking soda to the hot water.Washing dishes in dishwasher: Mix 1 cup borax, 1 cup bicarb / baking soda and 1/2 cup salt. Add 1 tablespoon of the mixture in the \"soap/tablet\" compartment. Add 1 tablespoon of vinegar to the \"rinse agent\" compartment.Purchase Plastic Free Cleaning Products-If you are in a hurry and need to buy ready-made cleaning products look out for: Sponges sold without any plastic packaging. Soap nuts for the washing machine.Line your bin with newspaper- Instead of using plastic bags in your bins, line them with newspaper. Check out Treadingmyownpath for a step-by-step guide to lining your bin with newspaper."},

I always work hard to keep the hens cool, and now the 4 new pullets. I got out my mister, about $6.00 at Home Depot. It uses very little water, and you can put it out where you want. Dave put it up high late in the day to start cooling off the area around the coop. During the earlier part of the day I had it by their shade area. Works great. One of hens walked over to it a few minutes after I put it out, and just stood in the mist. I think I heard her say, \"ahhhhhh....\". :)  I also give the girls wet treats- grapes, crushed ice, etc. I hose down the shade area twice a day, and around the coop at night. I also put ice cubes in the trough of the waterer to cool down the water. It all helps!!! I've never had a heat stressed bird so far....Thrifting Finds-Dave's on vacation this week, so we ran errands yesterday, and hit a new thrift store. I found the cute little 5\" pitcher above for $1.50. Perfect for my little roses! Reminds me of an old farm pitcher. I had been wanting a new light fixture for our kitchen ceiling. Ours had been an ugly brass one, 2 lamps, so I had painted it black/brown for the rustic look. I spotted this one, which has 3 lamps, even better! Nice and bright and it took Dave about 15 minutes to get it up. $7.00 compared to $60.ish! Ironically it is the exact match for our 2 lamp hall fixture...I also found a cute, cotton summer blouse, new with the tag, $5.00. Pastel stripes and nice for work.New (with tag) garden themed, little soap dispenser- $1.50-In the grocery category- at the Grocery Outlet I found-Farro, $2.99 a bag, for my new recipe Farro Salad w/Radishes, Arugula and Feta, Bought 2. Will buy more maybe to stash in the pantry. Info on Farro- VillageharvestAnd then, ice cream/yogurt, oh my! While I've never been a B & J fan, this is amazing!!! Not too sweet and very citrusy.

{"title": "The History of Aprons, End Of The June Blogathon!", "date": "Jun 30, 2014", "text": "Photos from the Sarah Plain & Tall movie seriesThe History of Aprons-I loved this and wanted to share it, pretty fascinating!!! From Facebook- Farmhouse FavoritesI don't think our kids know what an apron is. The principle use of Grandma's apron was to protect the dress underneath because she only had a few. It was also because it was easier to wash aprons than dresses and aprons used less material. But along with that, it served as a potholder for removing hot pans from the oven.It was wonderful for drying children's tears, and on occasion was even used for cleaning out dirty ears. From the chicken coop, the apron was used for carrying eggs, fussy chicks, and sometimes half-hatched eggs to be finished in the warming oven. When company came, those aprons were ideal hiding places for shy kids..And when the weather was cold, Grandma wrapped it around her arms.Those big old aprons wiped many a perspiring brow, bent over the hot wood stove. Chips and kindling wood were brought into the kitchen in that apron.From the garden, it carried all sorts of vegetables. After the peas had been shelled, it carried out the hulls. In the fall, the apron was used to bring in apples that had fallen from the trees. From Anne of Green Gables movie When unexpected company drove up the road, it was surprising how much furniture that old apron could dust in a matter of seconds. When dinner was ready, Grandma walked out onto the porch, waved her apron, and the men folk knew it was time to come in from the fields to dinner.It will be a long time before someone invents something that will replace that 'old-time apron' that served so many purposes. Send this to those who would know (and love) the story about Grandma's aprons.REMEMBER: Grandma used to set her hot baked apple pies on the window sill to cool. Her granddaughters set theirs on the window sill to thaw.They would go crazy now trying to figure out how many germs were on that apron.From the film Sense and SensibilityEnd Of The June Blogathon!It's been interesting pushing myself to blog every day! In the summer I blog more anyway, but not always daily. So I'll still be blogging but not every day :)  maybe... Thanks for reading, and I LOVE the comments!!!"},

The whole batch (4-5 lg. servings) was $9.00, maybe.... I scanned the recipe since I wasn't up to typing it all out-Portlandia - Technology Loop and \"Mind-Fi\"Too Much Technology-Reminds me of people I know!The Boring Stuff Works!Last year our AC died and we knew the 25+ year furnace wasn't far behind. We took the plunge and bought a new furnace and AC unit. OUCH. BUT, now the good news- we just got our yearly adjustment, based on use. We pay a flat fee year round (our option) based on a yearly average. That way there's no high winter or summer bill. Works for us really well. Anyway, our new monthly bill went down 35%! I think it will go down even more since we've had a mild spring and early summer. We also had a tuneup done, and found it needed it. Long story. Anyway it's working even better now. The boring stuff, like new systems, insulating, caulking, etc., it all works...."},

It really spruces things up! Doors and frames can get a bit beat up and dinged after 7 years. It just takes some time, lots of prep work, and a gallon of paint :)The 4th is coming soon!!!"},

She'd be 90 today, so Dave's family came up with a nice remembrance of her- they asked all the children, and grandchildren to come up with a favorite memory of her. It was all consolidated into a word doc, photos were added, and it will be printed out for all to have. It was great to read all the charming stories about her. She is missed...Painting Today- Oh Joy!After we remodelled our main bathroom we realized how banged up the bathroom door was. Now that I'm off for the summer, I decided to paint all the hall doors. I touched up the bathroom, where there were a couple of dings, did 3 door frames and doors. It looks so nice and bright! I bought 1 gallon of bright, white latex semi gloss enamel, and there's tons left. A nice, cheap fix up. Tomorrow I will do our little bathroom cabinet, bathroom door, and our bedroom door. Then 2 linen closet doors (still dark brown, ew) that were never painted by the previous owner. Then I'll do the inside and outside of our front door, with a new bright color for the exterior! The entryway is so dark, that it will tone down the color. Paint color for front door-Valspar Vivid OrangeI forgot to add- I pretty embarrassingly locked myself inside the bathroom. I had removed the knob, but didn't tape back the latch part. It clicked and I had an \"oh shit\" moment. I used a screwdriver to move back the latch and got out. Broke the knob accidentally, but it was that or be locked in the bathroom for 4 hours. Note to self- tape the latch in the UNlocked position next time :)"},

We are here such a tiny fraction of time, and we think our lives are all that matters. In the human course of things that's normal. In the life of a planet we're just specks. Watching and looking at the ancient areas, some little changed over 1000's of years, it puts things into perspective. I highly recommend it, and it will probably be on Netflix, or whatever soon.

It was $4.00 and looked new. It's a rough-ish, barn type wood looking piece with 2 wooden bobbins. I love the rusty plant watering can! I hung my thrifted seed basket below it. I like the 2 together! I also found a black shelf to hang in or entry, but I painted it white. Photo soon, with the display on it.Garden Colors-I love this time of year when things are really blooming! Here's some random shots of the front, and back- I love pollinators!!!Budget Gourmet Cooking-I love to save money, like everyone. I'm also a bit of a foodie, and love gourmet/ethnic foods with a lot of flavor. One of my faves is  Nicoise Salad  It's basically a French salad with greens, various veggies, hard boiled eggs, and tuna steak under a tossing of vinaigrette dressing. I had bought some frozen tuna steaks on sale a while back, 3 for $5.00. That's a deal, so I froze them! I bought a few things today and fired up the water, made the potatoes, peeled the eggs, cooked the green beans. The recipe (above) is VERY flexible.

After Dave and I got the chicks in the coop around dark (the 1st time) there was a veritable party. A new playground and look at all the toys! The chicks were flying all over, which let me know it was time to trim the flight feathers. I did that this morning, since there is a 6' fence between death and coop :(  Anyway, the chicks had a blast, and Ellie just kept an eye on them from the top perch. I watched a while then went inside. Lots of peeping, then at dark- nary a sound. When Dave opened the coop trap door this morning he said the big girls were by the door, and the little girls were all up stairs on the upper roosting shelf. They hung out for another hour or so and then realized they could go outside! They all did great today. I let the big girls out today for a break-Little Blackie, she's mellowed out after we chatted about another home for her :) Ellie, my sweetieThe new flock, all 6Enjoying the shade roofLast of The Major Gardening Done-Dave and I did backyard work for a good 4 hours yesterday. It was windy, warm (80+) but not bad in the shade. I... planted Swiss Chard in a pot with French radish seeds, green onions (clumping) in an empty spot in the garden, 2 pots of cilantro, moved some Italian kale too close together, dead headed flowers, pruned, watered, spread manure, cleaned off the deck, and deconstructed the outside/inside chick dividers. Dave cut some cedar boards for my garden work bench and added a shelf for me. I re-organized, dumped some stuff, and recycled some. I can actually see what's in there now! All in all, we got a ton done! The yard looks so much better and we took a break today... and I feel good knowing I planted more food :) I hope we're mostly done, but I'm thinking about planting potatoes in a big can?

I found some great recipes I hadn't tried before. This one was fast, easy, and has minimal ingredients. It's from Poor Girl Gourmet, something I picked up a few years ago at a warehouse book sale for a buck. Has lots of great recipes!!! We loved it and it's so easy! She has a nice looking blog, Tinyfarmhouse along the same lines, of cheap, gourmet food ideas, and more. Here's the recipe-1 small head cabbage1/3 cup EACH- olive oil, Dijon mustard, and honeysalt and pepper to tasteWhisk together well. I added about 1 tsp. apple cider vinegar and 1/2 tsp. celery seed. Pour over 1/4\" sliced fresh cabbage. I used a 1/2 cabbage as there's only 2 of us, and it really wasn't too much dressing...Goodbye Cookbooks-Now that I sold our stereo I have a nice new spot for them. I had some in the kitchen (my high-use ones) and the rest in the living room. Now I have a few in the kitchen, all in the old stereo cupboard. I wanted to scale back on my books, so I donated some old ones to a charity, including cookbooks, today. It's really freeing to get rid of stuff! My bookcase looks much less jammed and cluttered. I also put all the various books together by category. It look so much nicer now :)"},

Selling Success on Craigslist, Urban Homesteading Books", "date": "Jun 17, 2014", "text": "The Great Chick Escape!You know just when you relax and think everything is secure you see... 2 chicks out in the dark wandering around the backyard. Or a chick OUTSIDE the netting hanging on for dear life. Oh my. Two night ago I went to close our living room curtains, looked out and thought- those are odd looking ground doves. Then I looked again and went- oh crap, those are chicks! I ran outside and they both came right over to me. Kind of looking like- where are we??? I put them back in the coop, they seemed happy. Then I worried all night! I kept looking out the window with a flashlight. I figured they wouldn't venture out again in the pitch black. Thankfully they didn't fall into our little pond and drown, or get grabbed by a random cat that goes thru our backyard. Anyway, Dave and I looked and it seemed like they flew up to the top of the inside coop dividing netting and flew over. Then they found a little hole near the floor and went thru. Netting is re-secured now, and we'll add some bricks or lumber to fix that permanently.Yesterday I saw a lot of flapping and went out. Somehow one of the chicks was hanging on the outside of the netting, hanging with her peeps just inside. I found a small opening, put her back in and secured it. Dang girls! Ah well, all is triple secured now. The big girls seem to be ignoring them, so this weekend (when Dave is home) I'm going to let them all out together. Let the games begin. We'll see what happens. Hopefully we can normalize the yard and coop, if not we can wait a couple more weeks...Where to Plant Next?I was reading Wendy's blog post today Focus on Possibilities and it got me thinking. We're on a \"standard\" city lot. It's about 5,000 s.f. and I re-evaluate how we use it yearly. With a huge maple tree in the backyard, it cuts down on the sunny areas that we can plant in. I have a mostly shade raised bed that does well with herbs, kale, and collard greens. We've had the maple trimmed and thinned to increase the sunny area. That leaves the front yard. I'm still tying to figure out if I can plant more veggies there? We already planted 3 fruit trees, choke cherries, and service berries in front. I'd like to grow potatoes, carrots, etc., more root veggies. Maybe a raised bed? Still scratching head :) While we're not turf fans, I'm not comfortable converting our entire front turf area to veggies. I'm always thinking re-sale value in the back of my head. I want to have more land eventually. Think little house on an acre or two... For now I'm still thniking- where do I plant next?Selling Success on Craigslist-We bought a little stereo years ago that still worked fine. CD player, cassette, turntable, radio, big speakers. A couple of weeks ago I had a thought- a lot of people are getting back into vinyl, and I thought- time to sell it! We usually listen to music on our computers or in the car and really never used it. I dusted it off, made sure everything worked (except cassette, no tapes) and listed it. I intentionally started high- $165.00 to see what the response might be. No response. I lowered it to $100.00 and sold it Saturday! Ironically I think we bought it new for about $165.00 around 18-19 years ago. Now I have a big open space in the pine storage unit for cook books, and I may even add another shelf. Free cash and more room! Anya said she wants it to be a cat play room :)Urban Homesteading Books- Here's a couple of good looking books!

Putin in sinking a LOT of money into re-opening old northern Russian military bases long the Arctic, and having them available. This is making Norway and the UN very nervous. There are already hundreds of American Marines in Norway training with the Norwegian troops. One young Marine they interviewed said a little too much :) An interview they showed with a top Norwegian military commander revealed they are NOT going to take any action from the Russians laying down, they'll call in the UN.

We can temporarily set up a section in the coop for the wee ones at night, then out into a separate section in the garden by day. That way they'll be outside full time, but can get bigger for integrating into the flock. I'll post some photos. We'll shoot for this weekend.

A lot of these things you could buy at a dollar store, thrift stores, yard sales. I have a whole collection of kerosene heaters/lamps all thrifted...1. Shoe and boot laces – yes, you could use leather laces but why not stock some?2. Fence posts – entirely too handy not just for fencing but for gardening3. Barbed wire and chicken wire fencing4. Cloth diapers – handy for so many things other than the obvious5. Manual egg/batter beaters – whisks work, but the old-fashioned egg beater is hard to beat6. Hoyle’s rule book for card games – lots and lots of entertainment in one simple book7. Dice and dice games rule books – as above8. Goggles – safety ones9. A way to figure calendars into the future10. Solar powered fencing – even if you don’t have livestock now, you may have it later. And it can be used as a “first line of defense” or used for parts for other uses11. Canes – there will come a time when they are needed. Adjustable ones are better12. Plant pots for starting seedlings. You’ll want various sizes13. Metal rulers – because they last much longer. Different sizes14. Rain gauge – for keeping track of rainfall15. Barometer and something that tells you how to use it to get an idea of the weather16. Candle molds and a double boiler for melting wax17. Diaper pins – handy not only for the obvious but for securing lots of things18. Kits to fix garden hoses – because you can stock 10 hoses but what happens when they break?19. Cheesecloth – useful not just for cheese for all sorts of canning needs20. Pea shellers, corn huskers, apple peelers and corers, etc. – all those “yankee tools” that our grandparents had but we no longer use.21. Mimeograph machine and supplies – IF you can find one.22. Chalk and blackboards. Blackboard paint isn’t a bad idea either23. Goo remover aka Goo Gone24. Eyeglass repair kits – they make handy little ones25. Canoe – if you live near water or an inflatable raft if you’re not that close. If you get a canoe/raft, consider getting the big Duluth packs that outfitters use – they are waterproof (sorta) and good for packing26. Oars/paddles – even if you don’t have one of the above, they can be handy for improvised rafts27. Tire chains – if you live where it snows…28. Swim goggles – not so much for recreational swimming, but for any time you might need to go into the water for whatever reason29. Life preservers – if you need them, you need them30. Reflectors and reflective tape31. Pregnancy kits – I never see this on prepping lists, but it seems so basic… you want to know if you are so you can make sure to eat right, etc.32. Neck and ankle braces33. Canning funnel and jar lifter – often listed, but cannot have enough of these, in metal34. Pack saddle for horses/mules35. Liquid Smoke flavoring – my spouse swears by this stuff for nice flavoring36. Powdered lemon and lime juice – an excellent way to store Vitamin C37. Songbooks and simple instruments – for entertainment38. Powdered buttermilk – useful for cooking39. ClearJel canning starch – for canning pie fillings40. Pet veterinary supplies – basic wound care is a must41. Bottle corks of various sizes – for when you lose that bottle lid42. Room thermometers43. Bags/cloth to use to bag flowers for seed pollination44. Clothesline and wooden clothespins45. Clothes baskets that are actual baskets – they last longer and can be repaired46. An inflatable kiddie pool – thousands of uses (okay, maybe I exaggerate, but useful nevertheless)47. Lighter flints for refillable lighters48. Fountain pens, inkwells and powdered ink – those Bic pens you stockpiled will run out eventually49. UV window film – to help keep houses cool50. Mailboxes – metal for all sorts of caches and other storage uses51. Small paintbrushes – handy for many many things besides just painting52. Pet carriers – one for each pet53. Canvas shopping bags – handy for so many things54. Post hole digger, manual – but try to get all your fencing done before … these things SUCK to use55. Stove top waffle makers56. Wind vane57. Spare glass bottles of various sizes58. Mop wringer59. Manual juicers – glass or metal will hold up better than the cheap plastic ones60. Measuring cups – metal with engraved markings. Painted on markings will disappear with time61. Measuring spoons – metal with engraved markings. The commonly used plastic ones with painted on markings will break and fade62. Jar openers – the type that lets you get leverage on the lid63. Stove top popcorn popper – ‘cuz if the SHTF and the grid goes down, so does the microwave popcorn you have in the pantry64. Leather punch and knife65. Disposable ear plugs66. Mechanical pencils and spare pencil lead – see above about pens. Pencil lead takes up a lot less space than traditional pencils67. Folding cloth camping chairs – entirely too useful and easy to store68. Microscope and slides69. Old time photographic equipment – could be a new business!70. Manual typewriter71. Paper cutter72. Manual hair clippers – human and animal73. Steam juicers – stove top variety74. Slingshot and ammo75. Hard hats76. Sewing measuring tapes77. Velcro78.

{"title": "Little Homestead's Potato Salad Recipe, Homemade Ranch Dressing & No-Bake Hay Stack Cookies", "date": "Jun 10, 2014", "text": "Little Homestead Potato Salad-One thing I've always made when summer starts is potato salad! I love the stuff. My typical salad has been mostly mayo, heavy on the stone ground mustard, some celery salt, pepper and lots of celery. Dave's never been a fan, so I tried German potato salad. I'm not a fan :(  So what to do? I browsed thru some recipes and decided to switch it up. I used-9 medium/large sized red taters, cooked, cooled and diced to about 1\"-1 1/2\" chunks, or so. I then added- 2 diced red peppers, 4 diced green onions, 3 stalks celery, 1/4 cup fresh chopped flat leaf parsley. Toss gently.For the dressing I used- 1 cup mayo, 5 heaping tsp. (or so) of Dijon mustard, pepper to taste, 1/2 tsp. celery seed, 1/2 tsp. dried dill, 1/2 tsp. pepper, 1 tsp. sugar. Mix well with a whisk, then taste for flavor. I added a lot more mustard than I thought I would need to, but it's subtle. Pour, then toss, the sauce very gently over the potatoes. Refrigerate before serving. Dave's review? Pretty good! I thought it was a much lighter flavor and I like it! Next time I'd add some crumbled bacon or maybe some capers, and fresh garlic...Homemade Ranch Dressing-Since I love buttermilk I finally found a recipe that looked good for ranch dressing Ranch Dressing Recipe  I steered clear of the ones that are mostly mayo, ew.  I did add some celery seeds to this recipe. I love using fresh herbs from the garden. It's great! Try it!!!No-Bake Hay Stack Cookies-I found this recipe on another blog a while back, sadly I don't remember which one! If it's yours, please post that and I can add a link back. It's a no-bake cookie, great for hot days, and Dave and I love them! He said his Aunt used to make them for the holidays. I put them in the freezer for a couple of hours, since my fridge is pretty full to chill. Here's the basics-3 cups rolled oats3/4 cup sugar3/4 cup milk5 TBL. cocoa powder, or to taste1 TBS. pure vanilla extract1 cup peanut butter (I used crunchy)  You could try almond butter too?Put all the ingredients in a saucepan, except the oats and P. butter. Heat, then stir in the P. butter and bring to a boil, simmer 1 minute. Add the oats. I used 1 saucepan here, very easy. Toss well and coat all the oats. Take off the heat, and use spoon to form mounds on wax paper/parchment on a cookie sheet.  Refrigerate til chilled, and store in fridge in warm weather. Fast and easy!!!"},

{"title": "Freeganism In America", "date": "Jun 7, 2014", "text": "Photo from GallowayWild Foods.comFreeganism In America-I was watching part of the movie The East and then read about the Freeganism movement. I knew what Freeganism is, I just didn't know it had a name! In tough economic times people do what they have to do, but there are also people who are coming at this form a different take. A more thoughtful place perhaps. Wiki defines Freeganism as-Freeganism is based on the idea of anti-consumerism and that there is little need to purchase new goods because of the waste that society has produced and because they want to help the environment. The writings of sociologist and anthropologist Marcel Mauss inspire many values of freeganism. Mauss studied the relationship between forms of exchange and the social culture. Not only do freegans use their finds for personal use, they also share their items and use them for free distribution. They believe that the general public greatly misuses resources because of the ideals and activities of mass consumerism and do not want to contribute to the consumerist society.And-Instead of buying industrially grown foods, wild foragers find and harvest food and medicinal plants growing in their own communities. Some freegans participate in \"guerrilla\" or \"community\" gardens, with the stated aim of rebuilding community and reclaiming the capacity to grow one's own food. In order to fertilize those guerrilla gardens, food obtained from dumpster diving is sometimes also reused. In many urban guerrilla gardens, vermiculture is used instead of ordinary composting techniques in order to keep the required infrastructure/room small. Guerrilla gardeners claim to seek an alternative to dependence and participation in what they perceive as an exploitative and ecologically destructive system of global, industrialized corporate food production. Many rural freegans choose to learn about native wild plants which are easily sustainable and either bring favored species home to cultivate or identify wild populations from which to forage. Often rural freegans are also \"homesteaders\" who also raise their own dairy livestock and employ alternative energy sources to provide energy for their homesteads, occasionally living \"off the grid\" entirely.Working less is another component of freeganism. Freegans oppose the notion of working for the sole purpose of accumulating material items. The need to work is reduced by only purchasing the basic necessities for things such as housing, clothing, and food. Not working resists the idea that joy can only be found through the purchase of material items. Working is seen as sacrificing valuable time to \"take orders from someone else, stress, boredom, monotony, and in many cases risks to physical and psychological well-being\". This time could be spent volunteering in service activities, bonding with family, or participating in a number of other endeavors. The concept of voluntary joblessness has been described as means of completing tasks out of love for others while not expecting anything in return for one’s services. Working is viewed as a component of a system that has abused the world both socially and ecologically. It is realized that not working at all is not an option for everyone, but that there are ways to limit the need to work as much.Gee, I'm a Freegan and didn't know it! I have dumpster dived (not for food), picked up things by the side of the road, recycled thru Freecycle and Craigslist. We downsized our home, ripped up our turf to grow food, etc. I'm still needing to take up some urban foraging though, unless the neighbor's rhubarb counts? :) Are you a Freegan, or wanna be a Freegan???"},

Mostly so they won't fly out. I always watch them. They love it! They run around and try to fly :) Then they get tired and take a nap. It's pretty funny watching them trying to take a dust bath, on turf! Later I bring them in for the night, and happy chicks. I'm off for the summer after Wed.

I also found some heritage N.M. peppers, banana yellow peppers, lemon cukes (my fave!), yellow squash, Japanese eggplants, jalapenos, garden salsa peppers for salsas.

They are a calm, easily adaptable bird with excellent livability. The Amber's beautiful brown egg color and good feathering throughout the lay makes her a preferred product.And they were 1/2 price!!! I think their sale are winding down. Since I can sell as many extra eggs at work as I want, have 1 in retirement, and 1 that I may get rid of, I got 4. Here are the new chicks on the block-Barred Rock is Pru, RIR is Rosie, 2 Ambers I haven't named yetThe Garden Expansion!Dave and I talked about enlarging the veggie garden. There's so much more sun there now that we had a major thinning done 2 years ago on our hug maple tree. I thought we'd move the fence, but Dave suggested we have a chicken-free area.

Here's what I came up with-, leftover Starbuck's cups from a friend! They were leftover at her job and destined for the recycle bin. So, I took them off her hands.

While most people ignore this kind of thing, and most won't actually read it, it was pretty grim. I've read parts of it, since there's a lot there. I will read the rest soon. These are the N.W. highlights-Water-related Challenges -Changes in the timing of streamflow related to changing snowmelt have been observed and will continue, reducing the supply of water for many competing demands and causing far-reaching ecological and socioeconomic consequences. Impacts on Forests: The combined impacts of increasing wildfire, insect outbreaks, and tree diseases are already causing widespread tree die-off and are virtually certain to cause additional forest mortality by the 2040s and long-term transformation of forest landscapes. Under higher emissions scenarios, extensive conversion of subalpine forests to other forest types is projected by the 2080s.Adapting Agriculture: While the agriculture sector’s technical ability to adapt to changing conditions can offset some adverse impacts of a changing climate, there remain critical concerns for agriculture with respect to costs of adaptation, development of more climate resilient technologies and management, and availability and timing of water.We're already seeing this, despite our wet spring. Farmers may need to really get on board and start thinking outside the box if they can. I know that's a complicated issue, but it's sink or swim. I live in HIGH DESERT, and people still plant LAWNS. Ok, we get 10\" of rain a year, so where is the water going to come from, to water turf??? I'm worried about DRINKING WATER! Anyway, it's the old- DO WHAT YOU CAN WHERE YOU CAN...Scientist John P. Holdren discusses climate changeBritish WWII poster, courtesy of British War ArchivesIndependence Days Challenge-1. Plant Something- Waiting for rain to stop, have Swiss Chard, Italian Kale (heritage) and seeds for Collard Greens to plant. I'll do the summer veggies soon, after I get the new chicks. It poured twice in the last 3 days! New snow in the hills today, and pea sized hail this afternoon-2. Harvest Something- Apparently the hens are eating their eggs :(  Good thing I'm getting 4 pullets soon!3. Preserve/Store Something- Starting to stock up on meats for the freezer, with the drought in California more in the back of my mind. I bought more chicken, now .99 cents a pound, and bacon. I may start buying more frozen/canned veggies to stockpile as well. I keep eyeing my 2 five gallon freeze dried buckets of mixed fruit/veggies. That was for real dire times :(  I don't know if those times will be sooner than I thought...4. Manage Reserves- Get a Good Deal/Barter/Stock Up/Prep- Stockpiling more good deals on foods from the Grocery Outlet. Today we bought 3 used nickel finish knobs at the Habitat store, to replace our old, ugly brass ones from the 70's. They were great, $4.00 each instead of $11.00 new, and nice quality. All installed and purty-We bought a new 50 gallon rain barrel for $35.00 today, and Dave got it installed-The other 2 are leaking, so they may to to the free Craigslist. Got a few things on eBay. 5. Eat the Food- Try New Foods/Recipe- Bought a new Chili/Lime dry rub in the bulk spices section. Will try that on a pork roast.6. Build Community Food Systems- Will get some of my own rhubarb soon, but will ask my neighbor for some. She throws her away!7. Recycle/Re-Use- We recycled some screen that needs to be replaced on our side garage door. I asked Dave to cover the rain barrel opening (no hole) to keep our the leaves and debris. Worked great. I'll screen that door next. Will give the old knobs to Habitat for someone else. Donated our old stuff that was good to them from the bathroom. I have a donation pile ready for the local Mountain Rescue EMT group in Idaho City for the yearly fund raiser- clothes, shoes, a mower, etc.  I took the 4 knobs that came with the IKEA cabinet and recycled those onto our other bedroom closet doors. Old bathroom cabinet knobs I bought from HD several years ago, will be put on our bedroom closet bi-fold doors. I need to buy one-8. Skill Up- Learned about bathroom re-dos and gutter (which work great!!!) installation. I'm figuring how to \"upcycle\" some of my extra clothes in the Lagenlook I like.

What a relief!!! I finally got the tub caulked yesterday, the last little thing. I love the new look, bright and cheery. We got a huge increase in storage with the Ikea sink cabinet, and the pull out drawers. The plumbing is unique, and not for everyone, but we went with it. The medicine cabinet also more than doubled the storage. We didn't really need that much, but liked the look. I also always have \"resale value\" in the back of my head. All in all we spent about $2,200- for labor (flooring and plumbing), fixtures, and materials. One bid was $5,000.-$8,000 if we had it all done. Since Dave did most of the demo work, shower walls, floor, texturing, and I helped with finishing (painting, spackle, texture) we saved a ton! Dave was able to barter with a friend for a brand new $250.00 exhaust fan for a trip to the dump (huge dead TV). It's much quieter and looks nice and new.As a review, here's the \"before\" at the worst- water damaged floor, yellow flooring under the beige-Shower walls ripped outWe kept our toilet since it's only a couple years old, and just bought a new seat. My yellow shelf stayed. I added dark green as the accent color, but couldn't find towels I liked in that color, so I went with blue. I tried to combine folk art style with modern, but old fashioned/vintage. Satin nickel finishes all, and a very white gray wall color. We also replaced the brass icky door knob. I will re-paint the door this summer, along with most of the rest in the house. The shower curtain was also from Ikea, a nice country print.

It will get a fresh coat of green paint to match the bench.Prepping At The Grocery Outlet-I'm very lucky to have a Grocery Outlet nearby. I found the juices above for .99 cents a box. They're pretty tasty, not too sweet. For .25 cents per can, in 4 packs, it's a nice things to stock up on. All juice, and sparkling water. I try to buy really diversified foods and drinks to food storage. It's never to late to find something new. Always keeping an eye open for new things is a good idea.New Mower-We finally pretty much wore out our old push mower, so we bought an electric one yesterday, with a cord. Someday I'd love to get a solar powered one. For now this works, oh yeah baby! We always have a lot of debris in our yard, mostly from wind storms coming thru. Manual mowers just don't pick it all up. The electric one did, and mulched it all into the bag. We could then recycle it into the veggie garden. The hens loved it! While we're reducing our turf we still need to mow. No fumes from gas, and just plug in. If the zombies come no worries, we'll have bigger things to fry :)Old food production poster, era 1930's"},

Anyway, this is going to really affect the amount of food grown in the area so heavily relied on by many Americans. Crops are shipped all over the country traditionally. If you read up on this and see how bad this is getting, you might want to stock up on some things, or grow your own. When farmers are letting land go fallow for lack of water, then things will get pretty bad, pretty fast. Stop and think about this-Nearly HALF this country's fruits, nuts and vegetables come from CaliforniaThat should be a sobering thought. If you much more self sufficient and grow most of your own food, it probably won't matter. If not, you'd better start planning..."},

I had thought about making my own but was afraid I'd make a mess of it. I started with these items- 2 slipcovers (sale), 2 bags of batting and 2 pre-cut cushions (all 1/2 price) from JoAnn's Fabrics. I only wound up needing 1 bag of batting!Chair has batting in the top cushion, which unzipped easily. All filled out again, no more sagging on top.Green cushion under chair cushion. I rotated the cushion backwards since it won't show. Stiffer that way.I spent quite a while ironing both, as they arrived very wrinkled in the package. Draped and tied, pretty easy! Anya approved :)I adjusted the back after this, and made it a bit longer. I like the color, and they're washable! This will work until we can get some new chairs farther down the line.Recycled Coop Upgrade-We cleaned the coop yesterday, and since we have some shower sheet rock leftover, and insulation, Dave and I decided to insulate the coop roof. I thought it would keep it cooler in the summer, and warmer in the winter. It's not pretty, but it works. I helped hold the batting in place while Dave stapled it, then he screwed in the screws for the sheet rock. It's water proof so it'll work.The \"before\", no insulation.Before shot, dirty litterCoop emptied of the deep litter, we took a bit more out after this shot                                                                                         Fresh pine shavings, and D.E.! Litter added to the garden areaTalk about a skinny egg!!!Mine look something like this.. photos next time I make them Easy Global Veggie Wraps-I copied this from years ago when Macheesmo Mouse was in business in Portland, Oregon. They're back in business there now! They had the first Mexican, healthy fast food place there, back in the 80's! When feeding 5 I would often make these easy \"global wraps\" for our family. Just cook brown rice, and while that's cooking grate a bunch of veggies- carrot, purple and green cabbage, red onion, set aside, toss with a little red wine vinegar, dried herbs like oregano, thyme. Then I'd add kalamata olives, then put that in BIG heated tortillas, top with crumbled feta and top with the hot rice, and roll them up. Quick, easy and healthy. My kids all loved them! Sorry no photos! I'll take some next time I make them...My 400th Post Giveaway Coming!!!I can't believe I'm almost to 400 posts! Where did the time go??? Well, I'll give away something to celebrate.

We ordered some flooring one month ago today. The first batch arrived totally mangled, so they re-ordered. THEN we got a phone call a couple of days ago. The new batch was in a truck in Utah that fell off a bridge! NOW HD is totally out of stock with our flooring. So.... we went to a flooring place here in town, AND FOUND THE EXACT FLOORING I HAD WANTED, AND IT WAS CHEAPER!!! It's the Tarkett \"Fresh Start in Capetown\" above. A nice, light gray. HD agreed to let us cancel our order, which is nice. Considering... So hopefully we'll have our new flooring in the next week or so. Unless something else goes wrong :)"},

The shower walls were harder than we thought to install. The wall is bowed and a bit uneven. Common in an older house. But leak free, pretty and durable. Works for me. We opted for these as the glass window above was an odd size. I wish we'd been able to do fiberglass, but I actually like a real tub. I'll be caulking tomorrow (wedding, so bad timing). The toilet and sink/cabinet are temporarily installed for the pre-wedding dress up. I love the new Ikea cabinet/sink and medicine cabinet. Dave found the hardware on the cabinet to be really heavy duty, and a really nice finish. I found the cabinet finish to be much better quality than the stuff you usually get at the home improvement stores, sold as \"thermo foil\" over MDF. This is more like a really heavy paint. Nice! The china sink/counter is heavy and gorgeous, with a built in back splash on all 3 sides. When the flooring guy comes next week, we'll just remove the toilet and cabinet for that, then re-install. Here's a sneak peak (minus the flooring)-New knobs soon, tons of storage!Sconces installed tooFloor's ready for vinyl next week Grain Sack Stripe Slip Covers Sure FitLow Cost Chair Re-Dos-I have 2 pretty worn out overstuffed living room chairs. New ones aren't in the budget right now. I was going to try and make slip covers, but don't think I could do it without tearing all my hair out. The there's the cost of fabric. So... I bought the above listed chair covers. I'm going to add cut thick foam pieces under the cushions, and batting to the backs. Luckily they zip open at the base. Then add the new covers, and all done! The covers were $35.00 each and I like the folk art/homesteady fabric. The color is called linen. It should go well with the rest of the living room. And they're washable! Should last for a few years til we can buy new ones...Sad girl ready for a makeover!"},

I used Glidden's latex semi-gloss enamel in Behr's color \"Irish Mist\". I taped up paint sample for a few days to see it in different light. It's basically very white with a little gray thrown in. Since all the fixtures are white I wanted a little contrast, but not too dark. If you look on the right edge of the shower wall, there's red, then white, then the Irish Mist. It's very clean and calming. While I'm not a gray paint fan (trendy right now) I HATE beige, so I used this. I just wanted something off white. I think with some splashes of emerald green accessories it will pop!The New Renter- I noticed today 2 new renters outside my kitchen window. I grabbed my telephoto and shot at an angle thru the window. Nest building and very busy! I need to paint my bird houses this summer, or build some new ones when they're empty.

Dave has been working every night after work sanding, and texturing. When you move things around, and run into various things you have to re-create a clean surface so to speak. He did a great job on the texturing. He bought some spray texture to fill in the patched areas. A pal at work gave him a great tip- warm the can up in hot water, or in a heating vent FIRST. The spray comes out much better, it worked! I will wash the old paint areas today with TSP to clean them, then paint and a little minor spackling. Once the painting is done we'll get the modular tiled shower walls installed. We had to find a work-around due to our glass block window (love it). No grout, and easy care. Then it will be the flooring, then sink cabinet, toilet, etc. Then I can decorate, the fun part! Good thing we have a 1/2 bath available and the shower worked! We'll be donating our old sink, medicine cabinet, lighting, etc. to the Habitat store, since they're newer and in good shape.Ikea cabinetMedicine Cabinet Lesson Learned-Well, ya know how you run into things in the middle of a project? Yeah, we did too. We realized how TALL our new medicine cabinet is. We forgot to take that into account, instead of just the width. DUH. Anyway, our old light fixture won't fit, so Dave bought some sconces (we'd thought about that anyway) to install. He had to install new power to that area last night, but got it done.

We knew we wouldn't know what the water damage was on the floor until he got in there. Not too bad, because it hadn't spread underneath the wall into the adjacent small bathroom. He treated the mold, and it's drying out pretty fast with a small heater on. The decking is pretty intact, dry underneath. We have a makeshift shower set up, until the plumber can come and swap tubs. Then we'll install the shower, have the flooring done, and we'll install the rest. Here's the \"before pics\"-We installed the medicine cab, sink and toilet. The rest was here 7 years ago.

Our were getting pretty faded. I buy new ones every few years, and like heavier, quality made ones. They last much longer. Ross, the local outlet store, is always hit and miss. While I like white, forget it in hard water :(  I've always loved a bright blue, it reminds me of the ocean. Since I couldn't find the apple green I was hoping for (at Ikea but too thin) I dropped by. Come to Mama! What a great deal, so I stocked up for both bathrooms.I found some vintagey-looking, new green Ball Heritage canning jars today at Wallyworld (which I avoid), so I think I'll be doing a craft of 3 of them for a shelf in the bathroom. More green! I also found a cute white ceramic farmy looking liquid soap dispenser there. I got some green paint to (maybe) paint the tall bathroom door mirror green.New solar exterior lantern for our shepherd's hook by our front door, like a silvery mason jar! Cute and works well. $15.00 at Home Depot.Little ginger grater I got for a friend for a gift, so I got one too $6.00 on Amazon, it's a blow fish, and the glaze is eve prettier in person!Also got this cute birdbath at Ross for our deck for $10.00. How cheery! Our main birdbath is in the back of the garden. After seeing our heated one on the deck all winter, I really wanted one there. It comes with a long spike you stick in the ground. Perfect! Or maybe my herb box?I also got a \"jewelry tree\", that I saw somewhere else, dressed up for the winter holidays, Easter, etc. with little ornaments. I saw one last year at Cost Plus, $25.00, ouch. I got one at Ross for $8.00! I love the bird on top.Here's the \"before\" picture of my kitchen window. The old pull up blind was 8 years old, and not washable. My new one is! I looked all over and found this white cotton twill (I think?) one at Ikea. $19.99, nice weight, heavier than I expected for the price. I had to hem it, but I'm sewing this weekend anyway. It's the perfect width, exactly. At WWorld I finally bought a cheap floor lamp, with a reading lamp. $10.00. It was so dark in the spare room, I couldn't sew very well. It was like the Sahara today, dang bright, alright! After I hemmed it I decided to use the extra fabric for ties. That way it's more adjustable. I don't like looking at my neighbor's messy deck. It's so much brighter now, love it!!!More Decor- I need to sat away from Google images! I'm looking for some decorating ideas, on the cheap, including recycling some things I already have, of course. Since I was in Ikea recently it gave me some more ideas. Sadly the closest store is 7 hours away, but probably good for the budget! While I don't like all of the more modern stuff, I love their prices, and quality of their better items. I found this online, what a cute bedroom storage idea. It used 2 ladder shelves next to a bed. It's from Stockholm-vitt.blogspot I never would have though of using that there. Good use of space! I would probably knock one over slamming off my alarm clock daily :)   Ladder shelf from Ikea.comFrom  English Bathroom In Royal Inn Love the cabinet!"},

While I don't care for modern design, I really like the Scandinavian country type designs, like this kitchen-from Modern Scandinavian Country Style KitchenWe were really happy with the sink and cabinet we had wanted. I got a free \"family card\" last winter and we saved $50.00 on the combo. After looking at all the big box stores, and more, this was by fair a huge saving for us! $350. for the sink/cab combo, and it seems very well made. We checked all the big items before we bought them. It all easily fit in our Subaru wagon, with our travel gear. We also bought a medicine cabinet, as our will be too big (downsizing the counter). We got this one-to go over this 39\" cabinet, the counter and sink are nice, heavy ceramic, gorgeous!I'll probably replace the knobs with something more fun, like these Worldmarket Knobs Cute!We bought this faucet, since we didn't like the finish on the other one, pretty cheap looking.I got a new roll up blind for over the kitchen sink. Nice and heavy and washable. The current one is a fiber and filthy, so no washy. I looked everywhere, and this fit the bill. I'll just hem, and maybe add some decorative fabric in the middle. We have an icky view of the side of our neighbor's messy deck. I leave it 1/2 down, with a nice valance. No icky view!Shower curtain on the bottom (Swedish folk artsy), cheese slicer, fruit garnish set, whisk, green runner Then some edibles!

Then I saw these- Solar Night Lights/Reading Emergency Lights  Much more cute! SO I got to work. You can buy these kinds of solar light, with rechargeable batteries, almost anywhere, pretty cheap. I have some in my backyard from Walmart and Home Depot. I got 2 more today for $3.00 at Walgreen's.

We've purchased some of the new items- shower faucet/head, and other supplies. Now I'm thinking paint color, and small decorative touches. I saw the photo above and loved the little green bench. Then I found this on Ikea.com of course!I could white wash it, or maybe sand it down a bit. It's made of bamboo and would be great with a little basket on top. Then carve out a heart :) I'd cover up the screws as well. My IKEA list keeps getting longer! Good thing we only go once a year, maybe. I tried to find this flooring, but couldn't so we went with something similar in tan/gray. We had a coupon to a big box store, and that saved us a bunch! I may do the cream walls, can't decide yet. I think I probably go with a very pale blue/gray, very soothing. Right now I have a very pale aqua with kind of a soft, beachy feel. I'll do some before and after photos. I'll be tossing the beach stuff to go with more of a spa-ish, country, modern feel. Since I got most of it thrifting (of course) I can just pass it all on. Or maybe put some in the other rooms. I'm looking forward to a new floor, since part of it's got some rot. We'll start the demo next week, then the pros will come in!I love this kitchen, by the way, even though we're not re-doing ours, all we need is a new sink! That's next on the list.

Harvest Something- The girls are picking up speed with their eggs. I finally got the news from the local hatchery (much more reliable than the feed stores) when the chicks will be available. Right now I'm thinking an Amber White-another Barred Rock, and a Rhode Island Red. That will give me five, since my one hen may have to go. She's aggressive with me and may be with the young pullets. I may give her away. I can sell all the extra eggs at work. Three's a good number...3. Preserve/Store Something- I've been doing research on making more fermented foods, so that's on the horizon. I can't afford expensive crocks, so may go the way of canning jars and vapor locks. I think I'll go with this too Perfect Pickler 4. Manage Reserves- Get a Good Deal/Barter/Stock Up/Prep- Got some great deals at Costco and he grocery outlet again- breads, cheeses, and fish.5. Eat the Food- Try New Foods/Recipe- Made some fish tacos with our frozen fish, and fresh limes for the sauce.6. Build Community Food Systems- Will start selling eggs soon, and get some rhubarb from my neighbor.7. Recycle/Re-Use- Will be donating the usable leftovers from the bathroom re-do: sink, faucet, medicine cabinet, and a few other things.8. Skill Up- Learning about fermenting, post eye surgery, insurance for lens for glasses (no coverage bummer!), how much a new kitchen sink will cost. It's wild- I always thought cast iron was more expensive than stainless steel. They're actually about the same! Learned about how the new gutter will look, with the seamless ones. Our are falling off, and always leaked. On a long run, seamless is the way to go. 9. Regenerate What is Lost/Salvage Something- We're getting ready to spruce up the yard. Had both big fruit trees pruned by a pro. He did a BRILLIANT job! They look wonderful and shaped. Happy Spring!!! We're off to IKEA Tuesday!!! Photos coming :)"},

Oh joy!!! I had been to their old stores in Portland years ago. After we left there they expanded a lot more. They sell lots of pretty natural, healthy foods, with their own label. Much of it is very affordable, compared to say Whole (paycheck) Foods. I love their shampoos, chips, mini cookies, condiments, etc.Nurse Anya on the jobUnder the heading of vision happy- my eye is healing up really nicely! Anya kept watch by laying on my side while I was crashed out on the couch the day of surgery. Just like last summers foot surgery! What a sweetie. I had a follow-up Tues., Doc said it looked really good. Another 2 weeks and I will get a new lens for my glasses. Everything is so BRIGHT, wow!!!Under my bathroom remodel happy- we had to change our plans. Out with the fiberglass shower. Turns out it would have required demoing 2 walls. No thanks. We opted for another approach- standard steel tub, and white, tile look walls. This will be a much simpler installation and will look like a tiled wall when done. Works for me!Under gardening happy- everything is getting so GREEN! I let the girls out again this evening, what a blast!Under chicken happy- I went to the local feed store to check their chick delivery dates. I'm hoping for some chicks late April. Since they have to be inside I found it's better to do it later in the spring. That way I can get them outside a bit more, and not be so cooped up inside.Ensen faucet, IKEAUnder travel happy- we're off to Oregon to see Dave's brother and then IKEA! I read a lot of reviews of their cabinets, sinks and faucets. All came with very good reviews. They don't sell brushed nickel finish which I like with hard water, but they have the one above. It's called a matte chrome finish so that may be the one.We've pretty much decided to get this cabinet at IKEA, unless it's awful or out of stock. We like the integrated back splash. Tons of storage! IKEA has their plumbing go straight back, then drop. It's backwards of American plumbing. It creates a lot more usable space in the cabinets.Winter Feed- Alfalfa Cubes For Chickens-After reading this Independence Farms- Hay Cubes in Winter and this What Do Chickens Eat? Fermented Feed  I started thinking about using this idea to supplement the chickens winter feed. I bought a 40 lb. bag of hay cubes, about 2\"x 2\" wide. While I didn't ferment mine, I soaked them in really hot water, for about 30 minutes. The first 2 times the girls just looked at it. After that, all gone! I guess they liked it. Another good reason to read lots of blogs. I may try fermenting their feed after summer hits, and I can really watch what they're eating..."},

I took my right lens out and can see pretty well! I stayed home 2 1/2 days. Glad I did. I have to do lots of eye drops, and sleep with a small protector over my eye for 1 week. I'm having a bit of fluttering on the outside of the eye. The implant hasn't seated completely. Doc says 3 days-3 weeks is very normal. Hopefully it will be sooner, it's just so distracting! When I look ahead I'm fine, but moving my eye, it's like a spasm. I'll wait about another 2 + weeks and get a new lens for my glasses. I don't want contacts, so this is a good alternative. Somewhere down the line I'll get the other one done, as it's not too bad right now. Then I'll be all set. Now I feel like I'm getting Dave's cold :( Spring Gardening With Chickens!It's 60 and clear and sunny! Spring! Dave deep cleaned the front yard last weekend, trimmed the ornamental grasses, some of the perennials, etc. Today I had him toss some of it into the garden. The girls went to work right away. That's feathered composting!EllieLittle BlackieThere's food down there!I see something!Italian parsley re-seeded itself early, what a surprise!Rhubarb's growing daily!DIY Duh Moment-When we installed new windows and a sliding glass door several years ago, we ran into a problem with the flooring in the kitchen. It kept curling. The flooring went up against the bottom of the slider. We tried multiple times to secure it. We had a contractor come in today to give us a bid for our bathroom re-do, gutters, and a few other small jobs. We asked about the floor and he said, \"oh you just need a threshold strip\". DUH. Dave went out and bought one, installed it. All fixed!  :)   Happy St. Pat's Day!"},

A Longer List of Home Repairs& Improvements, More Creamed Ham, Independence Days, Cataract Surgery", "date": "Mar 8, 2014", "text": "Last years rhubarbSpring?It's been so mild lately, with rain, and things are getting green! Crocuses and rhubarb are coming up, grass is greening, and I'm getting out more spring/summer clothes.A Longer List of Home Repairs& Improvement-Well, when it rains it pours so to speak. Dave decided to go into the crawl space. He had found some mold under the edge of the vinyl flooring in the main bathroom. We're getting ready to remodel it. We knew there might be an issue with that. In the crawl space was a big wet spot. It's probably from a combo of the gutters that need to be replaced, and the shed next to that outside wall. We built a shed and attached it to the house, on the south side, between the house and the 6' fence. Looks like there's some drainage issues there. That's ok, since we can tear it down, and put in another one somewhere else. We don't need a big one anymore, so we're looking at this-Since we have a lot more room in the garage (got rid of kids stuff finally!!!) we can go small. We're going to have a gutter guy come in and do a continuous metal gutter along the back run of the house. Dave installed one years ago, and it's not holding up due to leakage. We're looking at going to Portland soon anyway to visit Dave's brother, and I thought IKEA! We've been pricing bathroom cabinets, vanity tops. Ikea has a great selection and has the odd 40\" size the original is. We may get something like this-I'd use baskets for thisNice birch finishI like the way there back drops off on the counter top for toiletries behind the faucet.We like this faucet!I did some research and realized I could put tile or slate over laminate in our tiny bathroom, and have a new counter in there too! I may do this in the summer. I like this-and this, but the sink's too spendyMore Creamed Ham- I made my 2nd batch tonite of Creamed Ham, and added 1 cup of fresh mushrooms.

Recycle/Re-Use- We're going to expand the growing garden, and remove our old shed and get a new one up. Both Dave and I had too many shoes piled up so we combined- I had 1 white rack and used Dave's old one up on top of mine. I bought him 2  ($7.99 each at Ross) to stack for his shoes. Now all neat and tidy! Sorry, no before pics!  8. Skill Up- Learning all about doing slate over laminate!9.

{"title": "Bathroom Remodel Prep", "date": "Feb 22, 2014", "text": "Similar to my color scheme, from Familyreunionhome.comBathroom Remodel Prep-After 7 years of living with an original tub/shower I think we'll finally be able to do a remodel soon. We'll do as much of it ourselves as we can. We have a excellent plumber lined up, and we've done things like this before. Our house is about 25+ years old, and is 1 and 1 1/2 baths. This is our full bath down the hall from our bedroom. The original tub is shot, all pitted and worn from the years. The shower has a glass block window installed above it (love it!), and plastic walls put over the original ceramic tile. Probably some really ugly color, I'm sure. No before photos yet, I'm too embarrased! We have a soft spot under the flooring, so we'll probably have to repair/replace that and find the leak.  We have a very soft, light blue green paint on the walls. Lighter than the paint above. The cabinet is old, and was stained a dark brown. I gave it a coat of white paint, which helped.  Cracks on the laminate counter too.We decided to go with a fiberglass tub/shower, because we both LOATHE having to deal with discolored caulking. Every place I've ever lived has been problematic. I have prepped, scraped, cleaned to no end, and no caulking ever works. It always mildewed. The toilet is newer and okay, lighting's good. We'll add new towels bars, shower fixtures. So here the new shower we're thinking-We wanted something more jazzier, but the upper window above the tub limits our height. No caulking to deal with though!!! Non-skid floor, and we may have some grab rails added at the factory. We'll do some cool shower curtains. I like to change them once in a while. I've never liked glass doors. Possible cabinet-We'll probably go for some kind of stone top, with a similar faucet below. I like the beachy cottage look, clean lines and lighter colors. Satin finish on the fixtures. I LOVE under counter sinks. No icky wet, mildew spots on the rim. I hope to replace our kitchen counter at some point, same thing- stone counter and under sink. Maybe in the next two years? Our flooring we already have, and will try to match.As you face the sink there's a hall wall on the right. We'll probably add a recessed medicine cabinet, n mirror needed. We may do something like this-The we'll float a nice mirror over the sink-From Houzz.com Some of these are actually medicine cabinetsWhat do you think? Hopefully we'll start in the next month or so.... More coming soon, I hope :)"},

More severe summers equals greater heat and drought. Not a good thing for farmers and folks who want to be more self-sufficient like myself. This may be the \"new normal\". Still thinking I may need to add more rain barrels...Back To BrownAfter being very cold early in the winter (7 degrees), then getting some snow recently, we're in the high 40's. We had lots of rain this last week. I walked out of a building yesterday, and it was 47, windy, with brown leaves blowing around. It looked like November! Right now it's about 46, with a good 25+ mph wind. It should cool off later in the week, but these temperature swings are crazy! I hope my poor yard won't suffer too much. In these kind of temps things can start to bud, then freeze. Not good. I hope things stabilize. At least while the wind was blowing today we had some blue sky!Girls enjoying some dry, sunny timeBlue sky! No fog or inversion!!!Independence Days Challenge- 1. Plant Something- Getting some seeds ready for late spring. Too early to do anything here yet. I was hoping we got get a small greenhouse, but I don't think it's going to happen. Too many other things going on that needs to be fixed.2. Harvest Something- Egg production is up!3. Preserve/Store Something- Using the freezer as always this time of year.4. Manage Reserves- Get a Good Deal/Barter/Stock Up/Prep- I keep loading up weekly with local, artisan, organic breads from the grocery outlet. Great deals there, with other things too! Also got myself some new winter P.J.'s, 80% off yesterday. Cute, red, and polar fleece with little penguins:) My new L.L. Bean coat arrived, loving it! I also got some other clothes last week, all on deep winter sales. I also got a Valentine's Day wreath yesterday, also 80% off. I always try to go to this one store, the day after smaller holidays. Load up and save for next year. While I don't buy a lot of this kind of thing (not into over decorating)  why not get new, cheap?5. Eat the Food- Try New Foods/Recipe- Using the freezer foods, some canned, etc. I had some huge potatoes last week, so I cubed 2 up, added a huge onion, paprika, garlic, salt, pepper. Cooked in the skillet til done, then added 1 cup of grated cheddar cheese, stir til all melted. Oh man they were good, with some ham and spinach.6. Build Community Food Systems- Dave got some free, HUGE yellow onions from a farmer customer at work. Delish for various dinners.7. Recycle/Re-Use- Swapping some frames with newer prints. 8. Skill Up- I just discovered a new breed of hen my local hatchery Dunlap Hatchery is selling. They're called an Amber White. I'd never heard of them before. The Amber White is a cross between a Rhode Island Red and Rhode Island White. They are a calm, easily adaptable bird with excellent livability. That's from Dunlap's. I may get these chicks in the Spring, since I'm down to 2 hens. I will probably get 3 or 4 total, maybe with some Rhode Island Reds (they're awesome in this climate!). I'm looking forward to getting more chicks!!! I can sell as many extra eggs at work as I want to. Since the city expanded the allowed amount of chickens in the city, I could go up to 8, but 5 or 6 is good for the space we have.Photos from Amber White  9.

Just no data connection/use to ATT.  I can save $360.00 a year, or more, no loss of convenience for me. Total savings- over $1,000. per year I'd rather take a vacation, or, ah yes- all those home repairs :)"},

A friend introduced me to it, and she thought it might help me. I'll try any kind of holistic stuff, so I tried this! This supposedly has all/most of the probiotics you could ever want, and you can make it cheap.I watched my pal make it at her house, she gave me a batch, then I made some at home. It's easy to make, and it's kind of like sourdough- you just keep some of it alive for the next round. Basically you can make it indefinitely, unless you kill it. It has helped my acid reflux. I'm hoping over time it will help y allergies and asthma. When I don't take it things spike back up. I drink about 4 oz. on an empty stomach first things in the morning. You can add flavorings to the batch that's ready to drink. You can buy the grains online if needed. My friend got hers from another mutual friend, who bought hers from Cultures for Health I'm going to make fermented pickles this summer with some of their cultures. It's pretty simple, but there are a couple of strict things-1- Treat this like canning- everything has to be STERILE. Jars, strainer, spoons, etc.2- Disinfect your counters tops when done, as this is a type of BACTERIA.3- Best to use organic ingredients.4- You can leave it at room temp for up to 72 hours, and then you need to make more and separate it. It eats up all the sugar. If you don't want to make it that often, putting it in the fridge will slow it down.I make mine about every 5 days, using a qt. canning jar. I use Sucanet and raw sugar, spring water, unbleached coffee filters. That's it. It's really cheap to make.Do your own research before you start this. There are many health benefits, and NO dairy, but it may not be for everyone. Some use small amounts for the dogs and cats. I give Anya about 1/8 teas. every few days.So here's how I do it- sterilize everything, lay all on top of a clean towel. The \"recipe\" for the sugar water may vary depending on personal preference (flavor) and the grains you buy. My version tastes like diluted brown sugar water. The kefir has no flavor of it's own. Many people add a citrus peel, grated fresh ginger, or whatever to the ready-to-drink batch.My two sugarsFor 1 qt. I use-3 TBL. Turbinado sugar, and 1 TBL. Sucanet sugar,  1 qt. spring water. NEVER use tap, or home filtered. You need the minerals. If you have our own, clean well, or spring water, all the better. Mix all this well in a sterilized jar, and leave about 1\" head space. Shake well til dissolved.Sugars and water ready to shakeStrain the existing Kefir water into a new sterilized jar, using a fine mesh strainer, or coffee filter, set aside.strainedready to drinkKefir grains, sorry no macro lenseCover new batch to drink with a coffee filter, so it can breathe, flavor if you wish. Set aside.Now take your kefir grains, about 1 TBL and add to your new sugar water. Do NOT shake.Kefir grains floatingKefir grains at the bottomcovered and ready to sit for 72 hoursI run the excess grains down the sink. Cover with filter and set aside for up to 72 hours. Then repeat. I keep my two jars in separate spots in the kitchen. Enjoy!Choc Oat Chip Cookies-While the cookies baked I made kefir. I like these the best as they have oatmeal and some good fiber, etc. I used 1/2 w.w. pastry flour. They're awesome!!! Choc Oat Chip Cookies recipe.

I'm going to make some hot cider.This is my gray life, sigh, mid afternoon... truly \"dark days\"...Last summer, Anya hanging out on my wheelie cartHow To Avoid Foot Surgery!Last spring when I was getting ready to set up my summer surgery on my left foot, I was told I also have 3 round calcifications in my right Achilles tendon. It showed up on an Xray. After limping off my left foot so long, it probably stressed it, or at least didn't help. After having my much need 1 1/2\" bone spur removed from my left tendon, I thought about getting it fixed. My foot doctor (of course) pushed another surgery for the right foot. Another summer would be shot, more expense and pain. And I would have to wait for summer. I limped into the new school year last August. I got my lower back working again, after listing to the side  for over 1 year. I asked my PT person, listed as one of the top ten in the country (somewhere) what she thought could be done. She started poking around, and I about came off the table. She did some deep pressure on it, as I could tolerate. After three more sessions she could put quite a bit of pressure on it, with much less pain. This winter I had sciatica, did an aggressive approach and went straight to a new person, who's a Chiropractor AND and excellent acupuncturist. My insurance would cover the acupuncture through her. After getting my back situation situated (only 3 sessions!) I asked her to work on both my feet. The left foot was healed but had a little residual swelling, the right foot swelling and some pain. She did 3 sessions, and a red lamp that's good for inflammation. Result? Yesterday, for the first time in 1 1/2 years I was able to wear my Danskos to work with no OTC anti-inflamms! Victory! I have very little pain, and good range of motion. ALWAYS check out alternatives, and ask around. I never thought deep tissue work would loosen things up, and the acupuncture helped too. Maybe over time we can get them to dissolve. If not at least I can live with them. Now I have floaters in both eyes. More about that another time!*** Yes, I fixed my watermark :)"},

I hate this time of year. We get an inversion over the valley, with bad air and fog. It's sunny up in the foothills, oh joy! A couple of weeks ago we had a 44 car pileup due to unusually dense, rolling fog on the freeway Multiple Crashes Police indicated citations would be given for texting, tailgating, and speeding in bad conditions. Really? You have to wonder.... There's a man who survived the crash in his Subaru Outback, amazing. Yes, that's a car next to the log truck-Not much car left, but he was in there, laid across the front seat, WOW!The freeway was closed for hoursThe Kestrel's Back-I went out this morning (off work today) to give the girls a treat, and found this-Looks like he got a ground dove early this morning. Ew...Dark Days Meal-Yesterday I took a bag of home-grown, frozen plum tomatoes out of the freezer. I made a nice batch of hearty pasta sauce with mushrooms and sausage. I used homegrown herbs too. Along with the local artisan bread (found at the Grocery Outlet), we had a feast! I used this pasta, great for a heavier sauce-Sorry, no pics of the sauceBlogger Glitch- Faded A's?I have no idea why all the A's in the text seem to be faded! Working on it...

{"title": "How We Accidentally Saved $- Part 2, Chicken Eating Eggs Solution, Independence Days", "date": "Jan 12, 2014", "text": "How We Accidentally Saved Lots of Money, Part 2-Dave and I both thought of a few more things after the 1st posting, How We Accidentally Saved Lots of Money Part 1 so here they are!*Getting a Pro Anyway?- If you're hiring a pro to do some big jobs, like plumbing, electrical, whatever, have them do the LITTLE jobs too. They will charge you a minimum fee just to show up. If you tackle a small job yourself it might take you 3 trips to the hardware store, and a LOT of aggravation. If someone is coming to do a BIG job, have them do the small ones too. You'll save time, and money. And maybe get a warranty!*Barter, Swap, Freebies- I used to be, and Dave still is, resistant to asking for freebies. Example- \"hey are you throwing away those bricks?\", that you see you're neighbor down the street demoing. Or \"hey are you going to throw out all that rhubarb?\" My neighbor would let hers die all summer. She hates it! We love it! She said \"help yourself\". Check the \"free\" section in CraigsList. I've gotten tons of plants, bedding, clothes. I even found a hide-a-bed. We cleaned it, got a new cover for it, and it's great for the spare bedroom. Barter too- I have traded eggs for other things, and have participated in clothing/home items swaps at work. I also got a lot of free veggies at work from the fall harvest. I even dumpster dived once for a monitor riser. It was new, and right on top, so I couldn't pass it by! Last year Dave bought our daughter's nice DSLR camera, she bought another one, Dave gave me his old one, and I've stored my old point and shoot.*Conserving Power- An programmable thermostat can save you up to 60% on your power bill! That's a lot! Dimming your lights by 10% (which is barely noticeable) will save you up to 47% on your power bill too. Hubby learned that in his classes in the electrical field :) If you have an attached garage ALWAYS keep it closed in the winter, so it's warmer in there. Don't let your pipes freeze. Use some heat tape and keep them thawed. Buy a front loading washer, and buy Energy Star if you're buying something anyway.Photo From Bell Haven Farms, link belowChicken Eating Eggs Solution-Last week Dave caught both the girls eating their own eggs, ew. I thought the one had stopped laying, but apparently she has been eating them. Lazy girls! I remembered a solution I had seen years ago, a Nesting Box Egg Catcher Problem solved! Since the girls are on a high quality feed, with healthy treats I know it's not some kind of defiency. I showed the concept to Dave- an angled floor with a padded area/tray to catch the eggs, that way the hens can't get to them. Since I've read it's really a hard thing to break, we're going with it. Dave will modify the nesting box by shimming the floors, then add something to catch the eggs. Photos coming after we're done, maybe next week.Independence Days-This is for the last couple of weeks, too busy to keep weekly track. I will try to get back to a weekly post now that the holidays are over. I hope....1. Plant Something- Nope, but I do have seed catalogs I'm looking at!2. Harvest Something- Eggs. We will have more after we modify things.3. Preserve/Store Something- Freezing the normal, breads, fish, cheeses, misc. stuff.4. Manage Reserves- Get a Good Deal/Barter/Stock Up/Prep-  Bought lots today at the grocery outlet, my regular place. I FINALLY found a good winter coat, online, from LL Bean, on sale! Free shipping of course. I've been looking for weeks online, eBay, local stores. Everything was either too heavy or too light. I needed something mid-weight. I love LL Bean stuff because it lasts forever! It's a bit longer than my old one, which will be great in the cold weather. Here's my new baby, coming home soon-LL Bean.com5. Eat the Food- Try New Foods/Recipe- Starting to use the fruit in the freezer, rhubarb, nectarines will be in a cobbler later today. Making a big pot of veggie chili in the crock pot today too. Using up lots of old tea bags in the Keurig My K Cup, which works great!6. Build Community Food Systems- No yet.7. Recycle/Re-Use- Selling a few things on CraigsList. More donations to the thrift store, since we're cleaning out a little office. I thrifted a cute twig reindeer, and some table top New Year's goodies for next year. Also found a gorgeous Advent tabletop wreath 1/2 price online, just gorgeous. Will reuse some scrap lumber for the coop redo. Bought a HUGE bird feeder at a thrift store for $4..00!!! It's a monster, I love the design, and the squirrels haven't touched it so far-8. Skill Up- Learned how to make my own Water Kefir. Good results so far- bloating is down, lost some weight. Hopefully, over time, it will fix some various issues. I had no idea how many things it can help with! The nice thing is you can make you own indefinitely, and not have to buy it. Kind of like sourdough.9. Regenerate What is Lost/Salvage Something- More eggs!"},

{"title": "How We Accidentally Saved Lots of Money & Supported Our Local Community Services, DIY-Indoor Hanging Herb Garden", "date": "Jan 4, 2014", "text": "How We Accidentally Saved Lots of Money-After I read this blog How I Accidentally Saved $200,000. I started thinking about all the ways we've saved money too. Sometimes we've intentionally saved money, but sometimes it comes from a voluntary simplicity mode. Do we really need more stuff? Am I (or we) shopping to make me feel better emotionally (this may be more of a chick thing)? I used to follow some blogs that were all about decorating. I realized that's not that important to me. While I love a beautiful home (I get lots of compliments) I'm not obsessed with the newest trend. Like OWLS- get over it already! Is this how I want to spend my time? Is this what I want to support? Shopping all the time, and owning more STUFF? It's easy to get sucked into the \"Look what I just found for 80% off!\" But do you really need it? Is there a void we're trying to fill?And Supported Our Local Community Services- While I do buy some items at retail stores, I shop more at Thrift Stores. There's always stuff \"on sale\" there :)  They are non-profits who provide community services. Your retail stores don't do that!!! One local thrift store I go to a lot also employed two of our kids, as college students. It's Idaho Youth Ranch They provide lots of great services to at-risk kids, and their families. Try to think about that before you go shopping for \"bargains\" next time. Who are you really supporting? There are some things I only (usually) buy new- shoes and underwear. That's what works for me. I also usually find better deals online for new shoes like The Clog Outlet (great for Danskos, Sanitas, etc.), eBay is great too, if you're sure of your size, and they are new. I also buy various things from from Craig's List, yard sales, and estate sales. That supports local folks too.It's hard to track all of it, but here's my shot at it... What we've saved on and how-*Mortgage- we pay every 2 weeks, instead of once a month. You make 13 monthly payments per year, instead of 12. The 13th one, in total, goes to the principal. You pay it down much faster. It's easy to set up, but nobody PUSHES IT! The lenders make more $$$ that way. Wise up and save more money! That's pushed 1000's $ more towards paying off our house.*Every year we check on our home and car insurance to make sure we have the best deals.*What kind of Housing?- We downsized our large 4 bedroom, 3 bath house, as the kids started going off to college. Some people don't do that, and complain their housing costs are too high. Downsize folks! If your house is paid for, it may still cost more money to maintain, not to mention labor. It's a interesting process to go thru- stay or sell. We hit it just right before the housing market crashed. We're not upside down in our home and it's value has come up the last 2 years. While I still want to live in a rural area, for now, we're here.*Learn how to take care of your place- I can caulk, replace screens, replace broken glass in windows, replace the glazing, paint, tear off roofing, turn off the water/gas mains, install a wood fence, set fence posts, use baling wire (love the stuff), do all kinds of home repairs. Learn what NOT to do yourself, like complicated plumbing or electrical.*Utilities-  we insulated our home, put in new windows, newer doors (used), and bought insulated curtains for our west side windows. It all adds up. We try to save water usage, watch the lighting, etc.*Water- We have water barrels, 2 x 55 gallon ones. I use those for the garden. We removed some of our turf for food production and buy low water shrubs, and perennials. We've save 1000's, there's less work, and watering all that landscaping! Less mowing too, think low maintenance!*Cars- We have one car we bought used, with low miles thru a car rental place. It's our trusty Subaru Outback. It's paid for, has low insurance and runs great. We chose both of our cars for regular, every day use. We didn't buy a Suburban for a twice a year camping trip, for instance. We chose to invest in one new car, 3 years ago. Our other sedan was falling apart so we went with a new car. We bought a Mazda 3 hatchback (boy can I cram a lot in there!), after I researched thru Consumer Reports online. $4.00 a month subscription, then you cancel. It saved a huge amount of time, money and worry. We got down to 3 very reliable, well reviewed cars, then got the best deal. Three years later the Mazda has had 0 problems! We also watch the gas, and combine trips. Get regular oil changes, tire rotations (free), etc. to keep them running well.*Expensive Toys- We don't have a RV, sailboat (I wish), camper, boat, snowmobile, jet ski, etc. Unless you use them year round, you have to store them off-season. You also have to pay for the fuel involved, either using it or towing it. Then there's repairs and upkeep. We'll pass. I'd love to get a canoe someday. That would be easy to store in the garage and easy to move. No fuel, very simple.*Clothing- probably save $100-s- $1,000s a year, depending on the year. Some years I buy coats, etc. I buy from thrift stores, and a lot on eBay, other from various online places. Some like new, rarely used, for 89-90% off. Even with shipping it's much cheaper. I love classic lambswool sweaters, the better made, thicker kind. I've gotten those off eBay as a lot of places don't even make/sell them anymore. Great for winter, and they last forever, if you take care of them. Today I got 2 pairs of jeans, and a dressy cord shirt for $10.00.*Household decor- lots saved. I also donate too, so we don't get cluttered or have to store a lot.* Furniture- We have a used solid wood coffee table, 2 living room cabinets, dining table, and 2 used dining chairs. We did invest in a new Flexsteel couch after wearing out several cheap, new couches. We will do the same sometime with our two overstuffed chairs. Lesson learned- with couches (unless they're well made and used) pay the extra for new and well made. Fabric covers are cheap, once the frame and base goes, you're done.*Cell phones- I have a discount thru my employer, and recently AT&T went ever lower. It was already cheaper, or the same, as the other plans. I just changed our plan last week and saved $30.00 a month! That's $360.00 a year. we've saved 1000's of $ over the years with my discount. Now it's even better!*TV- Re-think if you get cable, or not? We do have Dish, since we rarely go to movies. Some don't want TV period. I get it. This works for us. We have a \"low\" level package. I also get a lot of DVDs thru our local library to watch.*Shop at local grocery outlets, and buy bulk at other stores. Spices alone would be $100+ yearly otherwise, they're fresher too. I also grow my own. I have saved 100s of dollars just last year.*Beverages- I rarely buy soda, including at work. I drink water, almond milk, a lot of iced teas, and hot teas. Dave drinks coffee, teas and a rare beer. We don't drink hard alcohol, ever. That's good for your health. That's saved 1000's of $.*Smoking- we don't smoke, never had. That's saved tens of 1000's of dollars, and our health.*Eat out less- We do go out more than we should (still working on that), BUT I do use coupons some also. Last night we saved $8.00 on our Baja Fresh dinner out. Pretty healthy too. We choose not to go to fast food places.*Buy less packaged foods- Except for emergency! No cake mixes (talk about nasty stuff in there), pasta mixes, etc. I make it scratch as much as possible. I do buy some soups and Annie's Organic frozen lunches, for fast work lunches. I don't like to eat out at work, as there's only fast food nearby. It's a cheaper, healthier trade off. Lots saved there! I made a home grown nectarine cobbler a couple of days ago. Fast, easy and wonderful flavor. I had it made and in the oven in 15 minutes or less. My palate has changed over the years to less sugar and salt.*Grow your own food- As much as you can. That varies, based on climate, if you have a home, apartment, condo, etc. Raise some other things too, like chickens. When I decided to buy chickens I did a LOT of research first. Housing, feed, predators, county rules? We've planted 3 fruit trees already, in 5 years. We garden for food, have eggs, buy some local produce. If we go rural some day my first purchase will be 2 milking goats. After a LOT of research! Goats and chickens, I'd be all set!*Make your own- Clothing, cheeses, soaps, lotions, etc. Sew, knit, crochet!*Buy a good sewing machine- Learn how to use it. I have sewn, repaired and altered all kinds of things. Even my mother of the bride outfit, which was way too long. Came out great!*Health- that's a big one, especially when things crop up. I'm using more alternative stuff all the time. Acupuncture for my back, and soon I'll start on Kombucha and Water Kefir. Good for asthma, allergies, and other things. I plan on getting more exercise and losing weight. With my chronic foot pain, and then surgery, I really got slammed. Gained some weight back. That sucks.*Pets- When we decided to get another pet, after losing ours, we went with a cat. Lower cost, easy to keep if you travel once in a while. Feed good quality food, and lots of fresh water. Help them play and enjoy! No walking, scooping poop, etc. with dogs. Dogs don't mix well with chickens- your chickens are more likely to get worms, from what I've read, if they share a space/yard with dogs. I learned that the hard way, after 2 dead hens.*Hair care- I go to the same place as I did 15 years ago for cuts- $18.00 every 3 months. That's a really good deal locally. Sorry, I won't cut my own, and I color at home :)  Too much gray!*Medical- I have wised up the hard way on this. Doctors DON'T CARE about what you have to pay out of pocket. Sad, but true. I recently was told \"you need an MRI since your white count is high\", for my lower back. They didn't bother to ask me if I had a cold? Duh. I declined, since I had- a cold. Ka ching. I go to a more \"expensive\" place for my glasses because they will take our double insurance. I purchase vision insurance, cheap thru my employer. My hubby has his that also covers me. Ka ching, much cheaper than the \"cheap\" places. Sometime it pays to do your research with that too!*Sell your excess stuff and make money- I have sold thru eBay, and Craig's List. Everything from clothing, purses, jewelry, furniture, bikes, to sports equipment. Why not make some $$$ on stuff you're no longer using. Can't sell it? Donate it and get a tax write off. Or barter.There's lots of things I'm probably forgetting. The basic thing is- what do you really want? Do you want more $$$ to save, in an IRA, etc.? Fix up your house so it's more energy efficient? Buy land? Travel? Wear the latest fashion? Be healthy? Feel like you're involved in your community, in a ethical way? Think about it the next time you want to go shopping.... and save some money. I hope you found some useful tips here!                                                                 Images From  Persephone MagazineDIY-Indoor Hanging Herb Garden-What a great idea! I found this blog The 104 Homestead, then found this link DIY Hanging Herb Garden  What a wonderful way to recycle, and grow herbs in a small space, thru the winter. I will try this next fall by either bringing my herbs in, or buying more. Over my kitchen sink would work well. How smart!!!I love the fabric, or you could paint."},

I try to catch up on stuff while I'm on winter/spring break. Some vacation, but I like starting the new year clean and organized! Anya was fascinated when I was cleaning out the junk drawer! She climbed in the drawer hole, while I had the drawer on the counter top. While I was adding some small re-used cardboard boxes, and dumped the trash, she explored-What's this pasta doing here?Rice, what's that?And what's that?When I was done I opened the cabinet door, and slowly put in the drawer. Not a good idea. Anya could get her head out from below, but that was it. So, drawer back out, I shook the kitty treat bag and out she came :) She loves to eat. Drawer back in, all done. On Risking and Trying-I was talking with a good friend yesterday about being who we truly are, living an authentic life. We agreed it's hard to do when you're always worried about other's expectations- family, job, kids, spouses. How much do you share, what will you give up for safety, what if you're judged? When do you finally give yourself permission to really be yourself? What gifts do you hide? Later I saw the ending again of the The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel. I love the character Evelyn's ideas on things, I found it very encouraging-But it's also true that the person who risks nothing, does nothing, has nothing. All we know about the future is that it will be different. But perhaps what we fear is that it will be the same.So we must celebrate the changes.The only real failure is the failure to try, and the measure of success is how we cope with disappointment. And from Sonny, another character- Everything will be all right in the end, if it's not all right, it's notyet the end.Amen sister, and brother! Wonderful film if you haven't seen it, especially if you're a bit older :)  Maybe when I turn 60 I WILL go jump out of a plane, with a parachute, and do a water landing!"},

We're not into the boozing, partying New Year's thing. Haven't been for years. When the kids were still home, I'd make a special dinner and a midnight dessert. Well, maybe 11:30, for the youngest. We'd watch the ball drop, shoot off some firecrackers and off to bed. Now, with the two of us, we just relax, have dinner, watch the show then- it's off to bed to sleep in. No hangover, no cleanup! I'm taking down the Christmas stuff today, and the tree tomorrow, another tradition. New Year's Day ends fresh, clean, and decluttered (for me). On the year's when I went back to work the next day, it was all taken care of. This year I go back on the 6th, what a treat! And so it goes... We added fresh bedding to the coop today too, so the girls will have a clean New Years as well. Anya is loving us both being home this last week. She loves to snuggle.Life seems to have lots of twists and turns.  I have lots to do, all the time. I work full time, and am grateful I have summer, winter and spring breaks. I get a lot done then. Still, it seems there's always more. You never ARRIVE. I like the famous quote by Lao Tzu- A good traveller has no fixed plans and is not intent on arriving. It's a good reminder to me that's it's not always about doing. You have to stop and smell the proverbial roses, and just BE. Hopefully on death's doorstep (someday) I won't be thinking about all the stuff I didn't get done, but about the people I have loved and who have loved me. I include my pets :) And hens. The places I've gone, and the things I've learned with a little wisdom thrown in. Hopefully.So here's a look back at....What we (Dave and/or I) got done this last year-*Rebuilt the coop, a big project, this spring. Came out great!*Planted more foods and a pear tree*Tried new varieties of veggies, to find what works best*Harvested a great crop of apples, nectarines, Choke cherries and summer veggies*Looked at how we can grow more food in the front yard. Come spring we'll re-do a perennial flower bed.*Looked at expanding our backyard plot, will increase space a lot! Since we had our big tree trimmed a couple of years ago, we have a LOT more sun. More sun= more food we can grow!*Got a good deal on new replacement for dead AC/Furnace*Offered a part time job of the blue (very high pay) that funded the above. Only a few hours a month, and on call.*Did a fair amount of food preservation, despite being gimpy.*Caught up on thrifting after surgery!*Letting go of more stuff, good to do. I will not be a hoarder/over decorator! I've seen some homes where every square inch is covered with stuff. That makes me claustrophobic, and makes me think of unhappy people trying to shop their way out of a bad situation.*I'm trying more alternative things for various medical stuff. Acupuncture for my asthma is next. Kefir Water, (you can make you own)  and Kombucha are up and coming. They may both help my food allergies and acid reflux. A friend got some locally and swears by it for her tummy issues. More is in the media all the time about how w need more healthy flora in our stomachs to help with all kinds of issues.The Chinese Garden in PortlandVarious good things that happened-*Eldest daughter got married to a great guy! Wedding came out great, even on a frugal budget.*It snowed, several times. I love snow. I even had 1 \"snow day\"!*Both cars working great! One's paid for :)*I have medical insurance that covered most of my surgery, awesome!*Went to Portland, Oregon to see family, missed the terrible weather by one day! It was all ice and snow the  day after we go home.*Shopped at Traders Joe's and Ikea while in Portland. What a treat!*Trader Joe's was built in Boise, and is about to open. I love their healthy foods at low prices.*Visited the gorgeous Chinese Garden in Portland too.*Realized how lucky I am to have a job, that I love. My new boss seems great, that was a big worry.*Went to my first Highlands Games and Celtic Festival in years and years.*Too much medical stuff for me this year, OY. Glad that's over!Anya making sure I kept my foot propped upThe not so good-*I had so many plans for the summer- then overdue foot surgery. I watched TV like a mutant slug, not able to get out much. At least I had a wheelie cart thingy for 1 good foot! Then a LONG recovery period, with concrete floors at work covered by thin carpet, ugh. I'm hoping I won't have to have the other foot worked on, doing some alternative stuff.*The lower back really suffered, then recovered from limping for so long (a year).  PT fixed that over time. That hurt.*Then sciatica last month, ugh. Luckily I had the sense to get some acupuncture, all gone! *Two rounds of a cold/cough this winter. Doc got me on a nasal spray for allergies that nipped this round in the bud! Who knew!*Lost another hen*Winter came early, so the garden suffered a bit. Couldn't do the major pruning with a major cold snap, then snow.*Thank god for hubs, or the wheels would have come off the cart. Being limited physically not only sucks, but your other half has to try and pick up all the slack. If things still don't get done, life goes on. You just have to suck it up.Dark Days Challenge Meal- Out!After I had to go to work for a couple of hours, Dave and I went and had a local lunch out, at a Basque place, Bar Gernika I had a wonderful local, free range, organic, spicy lamb grinder. Oh my! So good!!! I know- I didn't cook, I know, but hey it was local!1920's USDA Food Supply SheetFascinating 1920's Family Food Supply List-If you REALLY read this it's fascinating. Look at the wording: \"depended on .... and if made from whole grain, for mineral substances and vitamines\" (typo I know). Fascinating, that even back then they knew the value of whole grains!Another list- Interesting how limited the types of fruits and veggies there were. You ate what was local and in season, only."},

{"title": "Home Cured Salmon- Gravlax, Dark Days Meal, Recovered Chicken Chairs, Kerosene Heaters On A Budget, Our Christmas", "date": "Dec 27, 2013", "text": "GravlaxHome Cured Salmon, Gravlax-When I first heard about Scandinavian home-cured salmon (or Gravlax) a few years ago, I thought it would be too complicated. It's not! It's so easy, and delicious, you have to try it. Since I love smoked salmon, I thought this might be worth the try. I've posted the recipe, along with a wonderful mustard sauce to go with it (optional) here-Recipe for gravlax-1 lb. salmon (I buy wild caught frozen, pretty cheap), 4 TBL. sea salt (or kosher), 6 TBL. sugar (can use brown), 1 bunch fresh dill. Mix dry ingredients, pack onto both sides of the salmon (skin can be left on), sprinkle 1/2 the chopped dill on both sides, wrap tightly and put in baking dish. Drain the dish as needed for 3 days, turning daily. Unwrap, rinse, pat dry, slice thin, and enjoy! I serve with rye bread or crackers, lemon slices and mustard sauce.Recipe for Mustard Sauce- 3 TBL. of the following- light brown sugar, apple cider vinegar, Dijon mustard, 1TBL. vegetable oil, 1 TBL. sour cream, 1-2 TBL fresh chopped dill. Whisk, and enjoy!Here's how it goes-Salt/Sugar mixDredged, covered with chopped, fresh dill and ready to wrapWrapped for the fridge, sat and drained for 3 days, then rinse wellDark Days Meal-Tonite it's homemade, frozen pesto with basil from the garden, local bread and salad.Recovered Chicken Chairs-This week I recovered 2 free chairs Dave brought home from work, that were headed for the dumpster. I bought fabric that has chickens! I thought about burlap, but since they're for the dining/living room I wanted a tighter weave. I was planning on painting the wood cream color, then distressing them. Sadly the planned paint job in the mild fall weather was cancelled, due to drastic temp changes. It was winter suddenly. I knew we'd need extra seating for the holidays, so I wiped them down, took off the brown vinyl cushions, and recovered them. I just used a staple gun, kept it taut, and away I went! Trimmed off the excess, flipped them back and Dave put the screws back in. Now that I have the time, we'll tighten up the chairs, with some wood glue and screws. I think I may leave the chair color alone. I did pre-plan: I bought twice the needed fabric in case of spills! I will treat the wood, and Dave is going to tighten up one leg. We were short on time. No paint for now. I kind of like the brown! What do you think: Cream and distressed or brown? I still have the paint!Old ugly fake leather seatsSeat unscrewed and removed, thanks Dave!Fabric stapled on, and screwed back on!                                                         All photos from Milesstair.comKerosene Heaters on A Budget-Several people have posted on their blogs the need for some emergency heat. One often overlooked source is kerosene heaters. Kerosene can be bought in small 1 gallon tins, and store much more safely than gasoline, and propane. I have bought several over the years, and here's a great resource if you're interested-Milesstair.com and here- Mini Kerosene Heaters for info about how to buy, and retrofit smaller heaters. I bought several kero \"brooder heaters\" on eBay cheap, bought new wicks and they work! I did some retrofitting like Miles, and turned one into a small pot heater, similar to his-I also bought a Perfection room heater from a thrift store, like new- $20.00 Pretty close to the one above. I keep several gallons of kero in the garage, away from heat. We haven't needed them, but it's good to have them on hand, just in case. eBay also sells lots of kero camping stoves. All of these are relatively odor free, and much safer than propane indoors. Do your own research on the safety of using these in your own application. Safety first.  Kerosene Heater Safety  Kero prices may vary depending on where you live.Anya, post kidsOur Christmas-We had our 3 girls, new son in law (love him!), and fiance over for our traditional breakfast, then opened presents. Hung out chatted. Our one daughter, on her own, stayed the day. We watched White Christmas on DVD  (before my time, still love it!), she loved it! I roasted a duck with lingonberry sauce for dinner. Yukon gold mashed potatoes, sauteed spinach and chocolate tart for dessert. Ah the joys of a good meal at the end of the day!Our new downsized tree after gifts, fits much better in the room than the old oneAnya peeking outSome fun goodiesSanta on skatesMichelle's grade school project reindeer she made, and those furry paws?Michelle and Anya chilling, cropped to protect her privacy :)  She's reading Tami's wedding photo book we got as a giftMy funny gift-Dave put together an Anya ornament!!! I bought these 1/2 off the day after Christmas- Smith and Hawken Gardening ornaments, porcelain, from Target, aren't they cute! I hoped they wouldn't be all gone! I also donated more decorations also. Buy some, get rid of some, that's my motto. Simplify, simplify!My fun, little USB powered color changing snowman. I put him on the kitchen window and used an extra cell phone charger (with USB adapter unplugged) to plug into the normal power. Works great!Some of our cards displayed"},

Eat the Food- Try New Foods/Recipe- Making a duck for Christmas dinner, with a new Lingon berry sauce recipe I'm inventing!6. Build Community Food Systems- Buying local when I can. We ate out at a local, family owned restaurant last week, with scratch made pastas, yum!7. Recycle/Re-Use- Donated a lot of winter decor, we're downsizing. I try to scale down more every year. I don't like the cluttered look. It's also stuff to store, when we're not using it! Got rid of our BIG Christmas tree that ate up way too much space. Donated it. We bought a brand new display one at a thrift store. A local nursery had gone out of business, and donated a lot of leftovers. It's tall, slim and fits much better in our small living room. A whopping $10.00! I fluffed it and will decorate today. 8. Skill Up- I figured out I could use my little tea pot to brew a pot with the new Keurig machine. I used the Luzianne iced tea cup 3 times, and it came out nice and strong. Cheap and effective! It's so fast too, compared to heating up the kettle on the stove. I made Irish Breakfast tea this morning- emptied the tea into the new My K Cup filter, ran thru 2 times, nice and strong. You really can brew almost anything with this!   9. Regenerate What is Lost/Salvage Something- I will be re-covering 2 free chairs Dave brought home from work, that were headed for the dumpster. I bought fabric that is poultry related:)  Will post pics when done...He's Back....I looked out 2 days ago, after the snow, and saw our little Kestrel was back. After he left I looked at the picked clean leftovers. It looks like he took down a ground dove. Surprised me as he's not that much bigger, just a LOT faster! Since we have so many city birds here, this doesn't bother me like it might some other people. Sparrows, finches, etc., have lots of young every year. We'd be overrun, or they'd starve, if a predator didn't bring some down. Decking The Halls @ Our Little HomesteadAnother peek at our stuff-Hand carved wood barred rock ornament from Cost Plus, love it! Scandinavian wood carving also from Cost Plus, $9.00.

Santa Came Early, I Interrupted Someone's Dinner, Snow Again, Pine Cone Pots", "date": "Dec 21, 2013", "text": "Happy Winter Solstice!-The days will start getting longer, yay!!!Our garden SunSanta Came Early-When Keurig brewers got really trendy I was never interested in buying one. You were really limited with what they sold, and all the waste of the non-recyclable cups. Now they have a My K-Cup filter, where you can basically brew whatever you want (within limits) in a special stainless steel filter- teas bags (out of the bags), bulk teas, your own ground coffees. No waste there!I was channel surfing QVC one night when they had a pretty good deal, with the machine, 12 various K cups, AND a My K Cup, for $79.00. They might still be available here- QVC Shipping was $7.99. I had noticed I was dumping a lot of bad iced tea, which I usually have with lunch and dinner. Dave drinks some, but we were wasting a lot. For coffee, he was heating water with a tea kettle, then waiting to steep in his french press, etc. I started thinking this machine would be faster, less waste, and flexible. Dave and I talked about it, so I bought one! They were out of the cobalt blue I was going to buy, so I went with a pretty lemon yellow. Works great! A tip, if you own one, or want one- being frugal, you can re-use the K cups. I ran thru my K cup English Breakfast Tea twice in a row, came out nice and strong. Dave got a gift certificate to WalMart (where I rarely shop, bad employers) so I bought some K Cups there. I was shocked how many companies they partnered with. I was able to buy my favorite ices tea- Luzianne, as they sell those too. So much better than the Lipton's I used for years! It made perfect iced tea, and no more waste. I'm grateful we had the money to buy one.I Interrupted Some One's Dinner-Late yesterday I was putting out some bird for before the snow was about to start. We got about 3\" inches last night, so pretty. I heard a loud shrieking and spotted a gorgeous male Kestrel. I've seen him around before. They eat mice and small birds. He sat for the longest time, then flew to a tree, then down to the garden, then the ground. I finally realized I had interrupted his dinner, a small bird. He kept a very close eye on me as I shot photos thru the glass door. He sat for a good 45 minutes as the snow started, not about to give up his meal, in this cold weather-What's cha looking at?Coop with Christmas lights up, very cheery at night!Snow AgainWe had quite a snow storm blow thru last night, and got about 2-3 inches. Gorgeous blue sky right now-I know some people hate squirrels, but I don't mind themdigging up the bird/squirrel foodI like this shot, I used my telephotoI wasn't sure if the birds were using our heating waterer, they are there every day. There were 6 out together 2 days ago, a regular ground dove party!!!!Pine Cone Pots-I thought these were so cute!

After we got to Portland I asked Dave if we could go on a scavenger hunt of sorts, to find a few exterior locations. We did! I'm adding a couple of side by sides, to show the real place and the \"dressed\" for Grimm look-The spice shop, as isAll dressed upMonroe's house below, and they were filming when we got there!

{"title": "2nd Annual Dark Days Challenge, First Snow! Independence Days", "date": "Nov 3, 2013", "text": "2nd Annual Dark Days Challenge-What's a Dark Days Challenge? I read about it two years ago and really liked the idea. I found the Dark Days Challenge at the now-defunct Urbanhennery.com  A few other websites seemed to have done it in the past. It’s a challenge to cook at least one local meal, per week, through the leaner days of winter. Your ingredients can come from your freezer, pantry, cold storage or local sources like farmers and other food producers. I’m going to make a personal commitment to one meal a week. I’m also going to try to include others in our meals, so our extended family can experience the pleasures of local foods, even in the dark days of winter. So here's the guidelines of the challenge, which I borrowed and modified slightly-Dates:The challenge runs from November 9th – April 15, 2014.What’s the Challenge?Try to cook four meals each month (1 per week) focused on sustainable, organic, and local ingredients. Whatever you can find is fine! Write about it on your blog, or here in the comments section. Feel free to link back to me on your blog if you have one!What does local mean?Traditionally local food challenges call for a 100 mile radius, but winter is more difficult in many climates. If you’re new to eating locally try 150 miles. Typical exceptions are oils, coffee, chocolate and spices. If you’re making fewer, or more exceptions, please note that on your first post or comment.What if I can’t find every ingredient locally?If you can’t find every ingredient, or even most ingredients, please still write about your attempts. This is just as much about what we learn, the obstacles we find and the decisions we make as it is about cooking with SOL ingredients. Do what you can, where you can.What if I don’t have a good photos or a blog?If you can take photos of what you’ve got, just do your best. Just you come by each week and add your meal/experiences as a comment. No worries, keep it simple, or just tell the story and we’ll use our imaginations.Leaves coming down as we speak!First Snow!We woke up to an odd sight today- snow falling and sticking. Melted but it's still cold. The high right now is 41, and expected lows in the 20's this week. Winter is here! A little more mixed snow in forecast. Leaves are coming down fast!!!Independence Days-1.

Recycle/Re-Use- Raking up leaves to cover perennials and shrubs, bought a great wool sweater on eBay- Eddie Bauer Heritage Nordic wool- like new!

It's funny- I realized after I bought them that they go together :)We store our coop's \"sun room\" in piles over the summer. Dave put it back up on the coop today, with the colder weather here. Will finish it up next weekend with some fresh pine shavings and a perch. Gives the girls some extra dry, sunny space, free of rain and snow. They love it!Sun room from last year, sunny and airy8.

We rarely lose power in the winter, but I'd rather have these items on hand and not need them.5. Eat the Food- Try New Foods/Recipe- Bought my first persimmons today. Never tried them, will tatse tomorrow. Lots of leftovers this week- extra pork chops, roasted chicken, and pasta. Great for quick dinners after work.

{"title": "French Apple Cake, Homemade Creme Fraiche, My Stats", "date": "Oct 21, 2013", "text": "French Apple Cake-I was looking around for an apple recipe to make with our left over wedding centerpiece apples. I saw another version of this French Apple Cake Recipe on a blog. I made this yesterday and it was so easy! You just make a simple batter (no mixer needed) and toss the apples in. It's very moist, and I did follow the suggestion- if you have no brandy triple the vanilla. Next time I might add a smidgen of cinnamon. I loosely covered wit parchment paper overnight, and it was super moist.Homemade Creme Fraiche-I decided to make some Creme Fraiche, after seeing ti listed with the apple cake. I used the recipe on the link below. I had made it years ago and it's really simple! Just heavy cream and sour cream (or buttermilk). Homemade Creme Fraiche If you've never had it think whipping cream meets cheese. It basically a tangy product that's great on top of, oh, French Apple Cake! Ooo la la, yeah baby! You can cook with it and it won't separate either. It's sitting as we speak.My Stats-I found this really fascinating. I get an email every week from the free Stat Counter program. It tracks who's looking at this blog.

Harvest Something- It's \"goodbye garden\"! All the tomatoes are now ripening on my kitchen counter. They'll be great four soups and pasta sauces. I picked the last bucket of basil and peppers.3. Preserve/Store Something- Made fresh pesto and froze it all except one jar. Used that for dinner!4. Manage Reserves- Get a Good Deal/Barter/Stock Up/Prep- Got a refurbished HP Windows 7 hard drive/CPU, $178.00 on BestBuy.com Computer #2 was dying. We had all the software we needed to set it up. Works great so far! I scored lots of higher end, brand new clothing at two thrift stores- winter sweaters and blouses. I've noticed if the Goodwill stores have new clothing in one store, they'll have it at the other as well. Score times 2!5. Eat the Food- Try New Foods/Recipe- Made a wonderful pasta dish with my fresh pesto. Threw in ripe tomatoes, and other veggies. It was heavenly! Bought some local whole wheat pizza dough- used fresh tomatoes, peppers and fresh mozz. Wow, really good. Will try this this weekend, hopefully French Apple Cake, as I saw something similar on a blog, but then couldn't find it. I like the big chunks of apple.6. Build Community Food Systems- Chickens are still being lazy, not many eggs. We increased the light that's helped some. Hope to sell some, but winter's coming on soon.7. Recycle/Re-Use- Bought the re-furbished computer.8. Skill Up- Had to do some research on buying a wireless \"bridge\" for a desktop to access wireless here. I get it now! Our old one died, along with the PC, new one is installed and working!9. Regenerate What is Lost/Salvage Something- Mended clothing.Lighting A Coop For Better Egg Production-Our hens really cut back on egg production when the days got shorter. With bad weather, Dave researched cheap, remote lighting set ups. Here's what we used, for $20.00, and I love the remote!!! We used this GE Outdoor Lighting Kit and Dave plugged the existing coop lamp into the timer. We had used the old fashioned timers before, but they don't work when it gets too cold. Now we just push a button to turn the lights on then off later. No going out in the bad weather, and dead timers!Facebook- No Thanks-I started setting up a Little Homestead Facebook page a couple of days ago. Then I read why you shouldn't do that- you lose control over your content, especially if it's all uploaded automatically. Not being a dot.com blogger, with ads everywhere, writing full time (must be nice) I decided to pass. Since I do this I couldn't afford to have someone set up a commercial page for me.

Some of the chicken water bowls outside had a little ice in them this morning. I stayed home from work today, getting over a bronchitis-y bug. Started on meds yesterday after I saw the Doc. The bugs have hit our school very early this year- colds, dry hacking coughs, tummy bugs. This bug is not as bad as some I've had, but I went to the doc earlier this time. I also used homeopathic meds right off the bat! I have an excellent sub, so I called here last night and she did my stuff today. I was over worked, etc. with still recovering from foot surgery, helping with wedding stuff, and unusual job stress from administrative changes (due to medical reasons). Very sad and emotional for the whole school.While I was home I found a great deal at BestBuy for a Widows 7 cpu, $178.00! I ordered one, and it will replace our old XP that's dying. We have the luxury of 2 computers (one we got free from our daughter, since bought it originally), and replaced the oldest with a new Win 7 this spring. What a difference, fast baby!!! I got a great deal for $10.00 from work- Office Pro, retails almost $300., another great deal.The birds and squirrels are hitting the feeders hard with the colder weather. No hard freeze yet, but we're close. We'll probably rip out the peppers, eggplants, etc. as they're about spent. Good crop this year though! Lots of green tomatoes left, and I'll harvest those in the next week or so. Depends on the weather. I bring them in, lay them in single layers on the kitchen counters. They ripen slowey, but are great for soups, and pasta sauces. The girls are finally laying again, with the added night light. We're getting a new water heater for them, since we didn't like the homemade version. We'll get something ready made. We had used a common design of a large cookie tin, with a low watt bulb. This sat under the 1 gallon waterer. Did a good job, but was a little too hot. Safety first.Leaves are barely starting to fall, but I love the colder, clear weather. 60's for the next week, lows in the 30's. I got out our comforter, washed it and we can snuggle in now.

I found this recipe- Best Scones, but decided to go with this one- British Cream Scones. I'll try the other one soon. I have read that scones with cream are the lightest, and most moist. I also read that if you grate the cold butter it mixes much better. It did, what a good idea! I used my new handy, dandy scone cutters I got this summer- RSVP Round Scone Cutters  They come in multiple sizes for mini party scones, etc.  I used the big one today.These were the BEST scones I have ever eaten, hands down. Flaky, light, airy little puffs. WOW. And the 500 degree oven was perfect. This was actually pretty fast too- I had the dough ready in less than 15 minutes.Cream Scones Recipe2 cups all-purpose flour1/4 cup sugar2 teaspoons baking powderpinch salt5 1/2 tablespoons cold butter, cut into cubes1/2 cup heavy cream1 egg1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract- I used pure orange extract instead, since I like citrus. I would use more next time, and add some dried cranberries1 egg mixed with 2 teaspoons milk for the glaze- I used cream Begin by preheating your oven to 500 degrees Fahrenheit, and set a rack in the top position of your oven. In a large bowl, sift the flour, then whisk in the sugar, baking powder and salt. Add the butter pieces and rub them in until the mixture looks like corn meal. In another bowl combine and whisk together the cream, egg and vanilla. Make a well (my note), then gently combine the wet and dry ingredients and stir them together.Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured board and pat it down until it’s about 1/2 an inch thick. Using a 2 1/2″ biscuit cutter, cut the dough into rounds and place on a lightly greased baking sheet. Push together the scraps, pat them down and repeat the process until all the dough is used. Handle as little as possible (my note).Whisk the egg and milk together, and brush it onto the tops of the scones. (I used cream) Bake 8-10 minutes until they’re lightly browned on top.Mine with lemon curd, OMG! Dave's with strawberry preserves, yummy!Independence Days1.

Summer/fall was here and now we seem to be heading into fall/winter weather. Local forecasters are calling for a \"normal\" winter (what's that?) instead of a El Nino or La Nina. That means possibly snow at the slopes for a Thanksgiving opening. We haven't seen that in years and years! We've been in the mid-40's the last couple of nights, with our first big fall storm system blowing thru. Lots of wind and rain. Green but chilly and wet. I've had to put the chickens in early a couple of time so they didn't get soaked. Bogus Basin and some of the mountains are now getting their first snowfall. Wow, and I still have tons of green tomatoes! 70's are forecast for the weekend, and more next week. I'm not quite ready to put the garden to bed yet, so hopefully it won't get too cold too fast. I still have tons of basil to make into pesto (round 2). Winter jammies are in the dryer, for my first wear this fall. Don't need the heavy comforter yet, but soon.

The recipe called foe 10 apples which made a pretty thick pastry. I think I'd go with 8 next time. I added extra cinnamon and a little squeeze of lemon juice. This is definitely more of a low sugar recipe, which I like. You really taste the apples! I used butter instead of shortening, and the pastry crust was so flaky!

{"title": "Sudden Death Syndrome & My Hen, More Rain & Mudslides, Thrifting, Mushrooms?", "date": "Sep 15, 2013", "text": "R.I.P. Little BlackieSudden Death Syndrome & My Hen-Last week Dave found one of our hens dead. What was so strange was that she looked healthy, was eating, and foraging one hour before. She'd also laid an egg that day. Dave checked on the girls, we had dinner, he went back out one hour later and she was gone. I checked her body- no wounds, no blood, nothing I could easily spot. Maybe she ate a nail or something else and she quickly bled out internally? I can't fathom what happened. The other two girls are fine. I always feel so guilty when I lose a hen- like I've been careless, lazy, or stupid. I googled some things and came up with this- while it seems to affect young male birds, it certainly fit the bill:From Agriculture.gov.sk.ca-Sudden Death Syndrome (acute death syndrome, flips, flip overs)-Chickens and turkeys that die of sudden death syndrome are most often found lying on their backs with their legs and necks extended, although, occasionally, they are positioned on their front side. Other than convulsions observed immediately before death, affected birds do not appear to be sick prior to dying.  The affected birds are usually large, and are most often males.Sudden death syndrome is a cardiovascular disorder caused by a heart arrhythmia, meaning the birds die of a heart attack.  Mortality can occur in birds as early as one week of age, and normally peaks around three weeks of age.  A fast rate of growth is the major causative factor.  The methods described earlier in this section to slow growth rate will help to reduce the number of birds dying from this condition.While the articles helped I still couldn't find an answer to all the questions. It gave me a bit of relief thinking maybe there was just some kind of genetic or congenital problem? It's too late in the season to buy a couple of chicks, so we'll do that in the spring. She was a great chicken, happy and gentle....                                                           Photos from Ktvb.com/More Rain & Mudslides-Several storms have blown thru the last few days. While we've had nothing like Colorado had, we had some mudslides. Many local areas, including a main highway last night, had sudden mudslides and road washouts. It rained heavily last night north of us, but we just had lots of thunder and lightning. It's supposed to cool down to the 70's this coming week and I'm hoping we're going down into a cooling trend. While I've loved the recent rain, it been in the 80's/90's and it just too humid! I felt like I was in the deep south yesterday working in the garden.Storm clouds over our house, but no rainThrifting-While I didn't get out as much as usual this summer due to my foot surgery, I'm catching up a bit now! After our third electric tea kettle died in three years we decided to go back to a regular stove top one. While the electric ones are much faster and use less energy, they only last a couple of years. I make iced tea year round and Dave uses a french press for coffee. The night ours died I remembered I have seen a Revere Ware kettle at Goodwill the day before. The next day I went back after work and it was still there! Nice stainless steel and copper bottom. It was $3.00! It's nice and clean and works great! I also found two brand new top and bottoms for work. I also bought some cheap crocus bulbs to plant next month in our backyard for spring. I also got a beautiful aster to fill in where an annual had died-Mushrooms?With lots of rain, and heat, we had a batch of mushrooms sprout in our backyard. Any ideas as to what they kind they are???"},

We had a torrential downpour last week, and it rained so hard we had flooded gutters. I had just gotten home from work and got the chickens in about one minute before the flood gates opened. Lighting was really intense and thunder rattled the windows. We lost power for an hour. We broke a record for rain during this time of year. Dave and I had watched the weather and we decided he'd pick all the nectarines the weekend before the storms hit. We stored them in single layers in the kitchen. The temp dropped 10 degrees overnight and the sky's been so blue since then! No smoke. Still warm here, 87 today, but it feels like we're inching towards Fall. I'm ready! I've been really busy with getting back to work, and moving kids stored furniture out finally. What a relief to have some space back! Now I can set up my sewing machine again...Independence Days-1. Plant Something- All done.2. Harvest Something-Eggs, compost, collard greens, all the nectarines, lemon cukes, tomatoes, 4 kinds of peppers, yellow squash, green beans, eggplants, basil, herbs. 3. Preserve/Store Something-  Froze some tomatoes. Froze most of the nectarines, canned some. Total: 6 gallons frozen, 3 Qts. canned. Good harvest this year! I also made an \"emergency cobbler\" in a huge lasagna pan-Lots and lots of nectarines!tossing in some fruit fresh to prevent browning before freezing4. Manage Reserves- Get a Good Deal/Barter/Stock Up/Prep-Added some more \"gourmet on the cheap\" (grocery outlet)  breads to the freezer for the winter. Bought more canned goods for the pantry.5. Eat the Food- Try New Foods/Recipe-Made homemade pizza with tomatoes, fresh mozz and fresh basil, wonderful! I used a local dough I bought on the way home. We ate French-style baked eggs for another dinner. Those are so simple and so good! 6. Build Community Food Systems-Got free veggies, including tomatoes, from work and made salsa and froze some. Selling eggs again. 7. Recycle/Re-Use-Compost. We had our two dining chairs recovered. I would have done it myself but I don't do welting. The guy also tightened the straps underneath and stabilized the frame, which was a bit wobbly. I got them used years ago for $40.00 each. Turns out they're worth about $400.00 each new! It's the cut out and framing on the backs. Very detailed. I tried to match the original Ikat fabric but couldn't find it. We went with a French country style fabric. Our kitchen can be a bit dark so it's nice and bright! And it has stain repellent sprayed on!                                         \"Before\" shot, with holes, worn and faded\"After\" shot! Clean and nice and stable 8. Skill Up-Learned some new tech skills at work. My boss is getting me a tablet, oh boy!9. Regenerate What is Lost/Salvage Something-Dining chairs. Trying to decide if we should have our two living room chair re-covered or not. Pretty spendy but cheaper than a new chair. That I might try myself....The One Important Thing Preppers Seem to Forget-One word- atmosphere. I keep seeing all these website and lists of things to prep for when the zombies come, or the grid's down. Food, fual, ammo, guns. Nobody's talking about the one thing we must have- an atmosphere to live in!!! If methane (see article below) keeping releasing at the rate it is we'll be in very big trouble. SOON. Methane is percolating from under thawing ice packs, rising up and entering the atmosphere. In the photo above a scientist is alighting methane from under the snow pack. They're called \"ice grenades\", as they're so explosive. Great way to toast a hot dog, but not our planet. From the article:If the temperature of the planet continues to rise massive quantities of the gas could be released into the atmosphere with potentially deadly effects from Dailymail.co.uk- Usually I Catch on FireIce grenades rising under the ice, coming soon to an atmosphere near you!  Balloons Over Boise!This time of year there's always a hot air balloon festival in Boise.

When I opened up the Nation Weather Service a few minutes ago forecast I was shocked to see flash flood warnings all over our area today. Radar.weather.gov  Starting tomorrow we're heading into a rainy spell. Yeah! It's been in the mid/high 90's and I am just sick of the heat!!! I had already planned to get new wiper blades all around today, since mine were shot. New ones are on and I'm ready to go, happy dance! It's been really smoky here the last 2 days, so hopefully the rain will fix that.490-year-old Spanish Documents The Irish in S. Carolina in 1500's-I find this a fascinating article and it ties with with other things I've read over a few decades. 490-year-old Spanish Documents Irish in S. Carolina  This summer I also watched a few of these episodes from America Unearthed History.com It's also got some really fascinating and some episodes can be watched online fro free. I'm happy they're doing Season 2!Beginning in 2006 the People of One Fire, a nationwide team of Native American scholars, primarily of Creek Indian heritage, began a comprehensive research program to obtain more accurate and detailed knowledge of North America’s pre-European history. Much of the work involved painstaking, paragraph by paragraph analysis of the archives of the colonial powers, particularly those of Spain. The team attempted to translate every Native American word recorded by the Spanish, while they were in the Southeast. Almost all the words were easily translated by modern Creek, Alabama, Koasati or Choctaw dictionaries. There were no Cherokee words, whatsoever. However, the words associated with the province of Duhare defied translation until this week.While investigating the similarity of Irish petroglyphs to those in the State of Georgia, A People of One Fire member ran across this ancient Irish lullaby, called “Bainne nam fiadh:” On milk of deer I was reared. On milk of deer I was nurtured. On milk of deer beneath the ridge of storms on crest of hill and mountain.”A check with Gaelic dictionaries quickly found translations for the Duhare words, recorded by the Spanish. Duhare can either be translated as “place of the Clan Hare” . . . or if the Duhare came from west of the Shannon River, it meant, “du’hEir – place of the Irish.”Datha was a standard Medieval Irish Gaelic word that means “painted.” Since the Spanish recorded that he covered his skin with pigments or tattoos, as was traditional among the Celts, this name makes perfect sense.Researchers feel certain that there was a colony of Irish folk living in what is now South Carolina, when Christopher Columbus “thought” he had discovered the New World. When and how the Irish got to the New World is another question. Most likely it was during the Medieval Period. Even if the Irish had originally known how to smelt iron and bronze, the nearest deposits of iron and copper ores were a 280 miles (448 km) away from the coast. There are no tin deposits in the Southeast for making bronze. A couple of generations of NOT making iron tools, and the people would have forgotten the knowledge.There is a particular irony to this stark change in North America’s official history. During the Irish Potato Famine, all the ports in the United States, except Charleston, SC and Savannah, GA were closed to Irish immigration. Possibly, as many as a quarter million Irish immigrants entered the United States through Charleston and Savannah. Although most dispersed throughout the Southeast to establish farms or work on the railroads, enough stayed in Charleston and Savannah to make them, “very Irish” cities. The Province of Duhare seems to have been located near modern-day Charleston.From- 490-year-old Spanish Documents Irish in S. Carolina"},

Independence Days Challenge, Juven For Foot/Skin Healing", "date": "Aug 31, 2013", "text": "Dave's photo from a couple of years ago- I'm ready for Fall!Back To School!I went back to work last week, so my posts will start to thin out a bit. I hate going back to work in the high 90's, it's just too hot. In an aging school, with no A/C in the gym and halls, the kids and adults all suffer. We had an open house with some of us in the gym last night, and I thought I'd pass out. Bring on some cooler weather PLEASE! Normal weather in late August should be mid 80's not 90's. This may be the \"new normal\". The fires have finally subsided, at least as far as the smoke goes. The Rim Fire in California isn't sending anymore smoke this way either. We were hit hard about a week or so ago from that. Smoke and heat, never a good combination. Blue skies this morning and 60! Cooler today....Independence Days Challenge-1. Plant Something- Nope, we're done. When it's 90+ you can't really plant a cool, fall garden sadly.2. Harvest Something-Good steady supply of tomatoes, peppers, eggplants, herbs, squash, collard greens, kale, eggs, and my first lemon cuke! Dave picked all the apples last weekend and I canned 10 Qts. of applesauce. Great flavor! I opted not to use the canning food processor, since it takes a lot longer, but creates more apple product. While it wasted some of the apple I could have used, time was of the essence. The chickens got lots of scraps! I basically just cooked the apples til soft, drained off most of the water, then reserved it. I started mashing, adding water, then switched to an immersion blender. I left the skins on.  I added some lemon juice, pinch of salt, a little sugar, fresh nutmeg and lots of cinnamon. Nectarines will be ready in another week or 2. Those will probably all be frozen. Time allowing, I may can some. Weekends are always crammed with everyday chores once work starts.Home grown organic pippins3. Preserve/Store Something- Canned 10 qts. of applesauce, bought breads to freeze. My organic Pippins (I think) had wonderful flavor! I made a big cobbler with crumb topping, with fresh orange juice and took it to a dinner potluck for staff. Everyone raved about it!  I gave away one 5 gallon bucket to a friend who lost all their fruit to an early frost.4. Manage Reserves- Get a Good Deal/Barter/Stock Up/Prep-Gourmet french breads and protein bars (helps my foot heal) from the grocery outlet, dress shirt for the wedding that Dave got at a thrift store. Froze homemade pesto.  Froze about 8 Qt. bags of rhubarb, free from a neighbor. Found some nice things at a local discount store for my daughter's bridal shower, here, on Monday. Getting car ready for fall- new wipers blades all around.5. Eat the Food- Try New Foods/Recipe-Eating lots of fresh basil and tomatoes.I made a Patricia Wells recipe of a traditional French-style fried fish (I used pollock), with a flat leaf parsley salad and sauce Remoulade- capers, mayo, diced pickles, fresh herbs and cayenne pepper. Delish! Think French tartar sauce. From a library book I got, called Salad as a Meal The fish recipe is below, minus the directions, since I know how to dredge fish and fry it. Basically beat the eggs and then dip the fish, dredge in the flour, breadcrumbs, cheese and cayenne pepper. I cute the fish into squares, and used a frying skillet on medium high with about 2\" of canola oil. Gorgeous, and golden brown!Use a simple vinaigrette on the parsley and toss. Add a wedge of lemon and it's dinner. Next time I will do lettuce with the parsley mixed it, as it a bit tough.Sauce Remoulade recipe-2/3 cup mayo1 TBL. capersI TBL. diced dill pickles  In France they use Cornichons, a tarragon-based pickle. Didn't have those but I know of a European grocery store so I might buy some next time I'm near there. I found this recipe on Pintsized Pioneering  I may try that too, with bigger cukes.2 TBL. minced parsley, tarragon, chives.pinch cayenne pepperMix and chill.6. Build Community Food Systems-Sold my first eggs at work yesterday. I charge $3.50 a dozen, and it off-sets the feed. I gave away one 5 gallon bucket of apples to a friend who lost all their fruit to an early frost. Will do that with some of the nectarines too.7. Recycle/Re-Use-I used my yard sale Kerr jars for canning that we got really cheap. Our neighbor had canned once and lost interest. I just ran them thru the dish washer and wala! Composting is going well! The chickens got lots of wormy apple scraps :) MAde donations to local thrift store. 8. Skill Up-Learn to make French fried fish and how many different kinds of  Sauce Remoulades there are. I know more about wound care than I will probably ever need! Read about amino acids and what they can do.9. Regenerate What is Lost/Salvage Something-My foot! Juven For Foot/Skin Healing-I posting about this because I had never heard about it. Right before I started going to a \"wound center\", I stumbled onto this. Part of my foot surgery incision was healing really slow. I'm not diabetic, and am healthy, but the incision is on the outer curved part of my heel. A bad spot. After I found out about this stuff, I read up on it. It's an over the counter supplement made by the folks who make Ensure. It basically supports tissue growth and protein absorption. It had rave reviews all over the Internet. I tried it, then I mentioned it at the wound center. They recommend it and the flavor's not bad. It actually works as a bit of a stimulant too! I may have to have my other foot worked on next summer (oh joy), so this is a good tool to have. I read that many hospitals recommend this pre-op as well. If you know anyone with surgery coming up this might be useful! You can also buy the amino acids thru a health food store, use the same dosage and make you own much cheaper. Mine was 8 packages for $17.00, using 2 packs a day. I should add- the wound center I'm going to has a lot of great things they use, and my foot is healing up much faster! Never any infection, just slow. Hopefully in about another month or so, I'll be back in normal shoes and have intact skin! I'm sure the Juven is helping.Smoky sunset from the fires"},

Last year I got a handful, this year Dave picked 1 1/2 quarts! Since I was gimpy I had him put them in the freezer until they had all ripened. Nice and plump. That way I could process them all at once. So today was jelly time! Lots of stems to pick off, then wash, then make the juice. While this is a bit labor intensive I really LOVE the flavor. I used this recipe Chokecherry Jelly and added a little almond extract, a pinch of salt, and butter (to cut down on foaming). I got a much bigger batch this time and tasted wonderful! It set up nicely and I listened to pinging the last couple of hours. I was hesitant when I first planted the shrub, since I'd never tasted choke cherries. Glad I tried it! It's easy to plant and no maintenance except watering.

I bought some pine nuts (cheaper bulk at the grocery store), lemons and already had cheese. I used this recipe from Oprah's former chef Rosie's Pesto , as it has no oil and great flavor. I usually use Romano since I keep it on hand (from Costco). It freezes beautifully in small glass canning jars. Last year's harvest lasted most of the year.

Dave's Mom had bought a Whirlpool dryer back in 1978. Yes 1978. We were gifted with it in 2001 after she wasn't doing much laundry anymore as her husband had passed away. Well, it finally died today. After a few repairs over the years, new belt, etc. and drying for a family of five (lotta laundry!) she finally went to the great appliance place in the sky. It was sad to see her go. After taking her to the dryer hospital, and being told it could be all kinds of things, we decided to let her go sadly. Dave went to a big box store and bought a new dryer for a good price, much less than complicated extensive labor and parts. With allergies we can't dry our clothes outside, since that works as a pollen magnet. I've read about people with severe allergies, and chronic colds drying their clothes outside and I cringe. That's a big no-no from allergists. Oh well. Our old girl went to the recycling place down the street. Maybe she'll come back as a toaster and find a lovely new home.

I had been losing weight thru last summer and hit a mental plateau and stalled out. I started stress eating from being in chronic pain as the year wore on. So now I'm doing this for my health and to feel better. I don't want to look like a 10 year old girl or Barbie. I'm losing already, woo hoo! I use Fatsecret.com mostly just to track portion size and the ratio of fats, carbs,  and proteins. I'm limiting the grain carbs since that is easy for me most of the time and seems to increase the weight loss. I also eat something if I'm really craving it, just less! Not doing that always works against me. Sometimes I also just have to balance that the next day. I also weigh-in every day and it tracks that as well. My dietitian (free thru health insurance) I worked with told me about that website and it's all free. I put a free Android phone app on my phone and I can do a search if eating out to see how many cals, etc. a dish has. I want to take Zumba classes once my foot is completely healed. It sounds like fun and I get bored working out in a gym. I started some PT sessions yesterday and I'm moving much better today. It's never to late to be healthier!Best Tiny House So Far-I have followed the Tinyhouseblog for years, and this is one of the best designs I've ever seen. You can tell Dondi's an engineer! While not for folks with kids, or us aging folks who don't want a sleeping loft, it's a really good use of space and materials. I think it's an excellent alternative for young kids getting started who don't want to get tied down to a big mortgage, or live in the city (though some do). Erin and Dondis Off-Grid-Tiny House - lots of photos there!I love the bigger kitchen as many tiny homes suffer from a lack of a real, working kitchen-Nice use of vertical space!"},

A couple of days ago it was up in our backyard tree screeching. I spent quite a bit of time shooting photos until I got a couple of clear shots. I emailed them to the head person at the Birds Of Prey Center to see if she could I.D. it. It came back that it was a young Swainson's Hawk. They mostly eat insects, tiny birds and rodents. That's good! No chicken dinner! Gorgeous bird. From Dave's Every Things In Photos blogMy Hubby's photo, he had a better telephoto lens and open viewing1. Plant Something- Nope, not til next year. Too hot (90's) and once it freezes we're done. We may get a small greenhouse next year and move the veggie bed out another 4'-6' to be able to plant more. I like this one- 6'-x-4'-Greenhouse Starter Kit  This smaller size would fit our veggie garden about right. I think it would hold up well with the winds and storms. With this we could grow more earlier and later. 2. Harvest Something-Several kinds of peppers, tomatoes (mostly the little yellow ones), eggplants, blackberries, kale, collard greens, and herbs. Basil is finally big enough to make some pesto to freeze. My Italian parsley is finally perking up! Compost and eggs.3. Preserve/Store Something-Made more pickled red onions. Will can the choke cherry jelly soon. Bought more whole grain/teff rolls as .99 cents a bag at the outlet. Really wonderful flavor. Teff is an African grain that's getting popular.

Of all places, who knew? I knew they sold cheap, odd clothes but not a more name brand! I love EB stuff since it usually lasts forever! I got a beautiful periwinkle blue, buttercup yellow, and white. They list on their website at about $25.00 each. Ha! I'm set for fall, since I can use these alone, with vests, or sweaters. Dave and I found some nice, new 11 x 14\" frames at Ross for his photography prints. Hard to find used ones in that size. He's also getting some old, never used free LED bulbs from a pal for the house. Dave had a good idea to start swapping LED into the house- every paycheck he buys one and installs it. Over time the whole house (except the 3 way bulbs) will be replaced. Much cleaner light and they last forever!!!5. Eat the Food- Try New Foods/Recipe-Took all my garden veggies and made a frittata, yummy! I'm cutting back on eating and starting to lost some weight. I'm happy I only gained about 5 lbs. during foot surgery recovery, but I need to get back on track. Working on more protein, lean meats, much less grains and sugar.

I was going to copy and print the pages I needed, then I had a second thought- why not save the paper and ink and save them as a digital file? Bearing in mind, I do have a computer in the kitchen/dining area. The kitchen area came with a desk already built in so it's perfect. I also started going thru cookbooks on my book case and went into the same mode- I will scan what I will actually use, then donate the books to a charity. Or maybe sell them on eBay? Or save them for a giveaway! Why not? Less paper, and the pages won't get dirty!Crow Wreath For Fall-I saw this online ($69.00 ouch!) and thought it was too cute for fall!

We hung out by the water, soaked my feet (nice and cool!) watched the swimmers, and the wildlife...                                                                      Dave                                                                      Lilly or iris?Cute Moxie coffee place display. Sorry cell phone pics!We hit the thrift store and a \"junktique\" store that's we always seemed to miss and was never open. It's like the other ones we've seen up in Idaho City- a lot of stuff, prices way too high, and an older owner who doesn't seem like they actually want to sell anything. It's more like a place to store their stuff. Way overpriced but I found this cute spice rack for $10.00! I think my Grandma had something similar. I cleaned it up a little and did some minor gluing-It'll go up in the kitchen with something vintageDave found 3 glass insulators for $1.00 each so we bought 3. I gave them a good bath and put them on our living room window shelf-I also found a really, nice denim blouse at a thrift store, perfect for work. Got this really pretty small casserole/serving dish marked \"Mexico- No Lead\" on the bottom. Really nice glazing for $3.00-We stopped on the way and hit my favorite local farm produce store. Lat year their berries got wiped out by hail, this year they have a bumper crop! I bought their last 3 baskets they had out, small and dead ripe. The last time we bought some there I went back a week later and bought more. Best ones I've ever had! Perfect flavor and deep red all the way thru-I made a wonderful fresh strawberry pie, OMG! It was so good! Sorry, no pics. Easy too- Strawberry Pie IIMy World's Biggest Chicken Egg-Dave brought this in from the coop and I almost fainted! I have pretty big hands, and it weighed in at 3 1/2 oz. It had to have been REALLY painful! Yowza. It had a double yolk too! Probably from one of my big Hampshire Reds-Maybe I should buy that hen a chicken chair to rest on? Saw this at Pier One-Easy Orange Charlotte Dessert-After baking desserts in 100 degree weather (with A/C) I decided I needed something cold! I saw this wonderful recipe at Thriftathome.blogspot.com  Here it is, easy peasy, pretty and pretty cheap! Thanks Margo !!!In a mixing bowl, dissolve 1 envelope unflavored gelatin in 1/3 cup cold water. Add 1/3 cup boiling water.Add:scant 3/4 cup sugar1 cup freshly squeezed orange juice (about 5 1/2 oranges for me)zest of one orange  (this really made the dessert)1 Tbsp. lemon juicepinch saltPlace in refrigerator.  When the mixture starts to gel in 20-40 minutes, fold in:2 egg whites, beaten with a pinch of cream of tartar until stiff1/2 cup whipping cream, beaten until just beginning to form soft peaksPour mixture into lightly greased bowl or mold, cover.  Refrigerate for several hours until firm. Garden Harvest!The weird planting weather early in the summer, then record heat (115) really did a number on the garden. I think things have finally leveled off. Here's yesterday harvest, plus about 3 cups of blackberries. No lemon cukes yet, but they're coming. They always seem to be last, dang it!!! There are several kinds of peppers, 2 kinds of tomatoes, and eggplants so far. Lots more green Roma tomatoes almost ripe. I'll probably use the peppers for a garden fritatta...Toxic Treats For Chickens-Really good, informative article here! Toxic Treats For Chickens                    Healthy cool treat here!

{"title": "Save Money On Your Prescriptions, Independence Days Challenge, Just Like Grandma's", "date": "Aug 1, 2013", "text": "Save Money on Your Insurance Prescriptions-I understand that some folks don't have insurance, so this may not be relevant for you. The main thing in this I want to stress is do your research. Many times your insurance prescription coverage will change, with no notice to you. Mine did at some point in the last 2 years. They changed some of the categories of what they call \"maintenance\" prescriptions. This may take a phone call to your insurance provider as mine did.  I use two very expensive medications that I could only get 1 month at a time, due to the high co-pay. My insurance allows for three month refills at a time, BUT not for some meds as far as the amount of the co-pay. Recently they changed it to a one month co-pay for three months worth of meds, a HUGE savings! In other words- previously I had paid $125.00 for one month refill. Now I pay $125.00 for a three month refill. They didn't allow this before for these 2 particular meds. Glad I called to ask, they never tell you about these changes :(  Review your insurance once in a while. You may save a ton of money.Independence Days Challenge-1. Plant Something- Done for now.Too hot!2. Harvest Something- Blackberries, tomatoes, eggplants, herbs, kale, peppers, collard greens, green apples from tree trimming, eggs, compost, pine shavings from coop cleaning.3. Preserve/Store Something- Made 7 Qts. applesauce from green apples on my outdoor canning set up. Adding various stuff to the freezer, will start making Choke Cherry jelly soon.Outdoor canning station4. Manage Reserves- Get a Good Deal/Barter/Stock Up/Prep- Stocked up on a few clothing items for work from thrift stores, or deeply discounted online. Bought several used cheap DVDs online, since our VHS player finally died. Only a DVD player now, sigh. Got lots from library!5. Eat the Food- Try New Foods/Recipe- Made new spicy seafood pasta dish, as I am sick of chicken, pork and fish. Made a giant apple cobbler from some of the green apples.6. Build Community Food Systems- Going to the farmer's market this weekend. More free rhubarb coming from neighbor.7. Recycle/Re-Use- Got two free night stands,and a small cabinet, so we will use for camera equipment storage, etc. Needs paint job maybe. Got a rolling cooler for $3.00 from same sale. Picked up a nice designer blouse there for $2.00 :) . Hubby got a free tent from our rhubarb neighbor to give to our daughter who's starting to gather camping equipment on the cheap. Got donations ready to pass on. Put coop shavings into veggie garden.                                                           Dave cleaning coop with thrifting shop vac after he shoveled most out                                          clean coop, with some herbs thrown in                                                         shavings in garden8. Skill Up- I'm walking with no boot or crutch! I had to re-learn this. I've been watching shows about wedding dress shopping as my first girl to get married and we went dress shopping last night! I didn't cry! Learned to call my insurance company once a year.9. Regenerate What is Lost/Salvage Something- Hubby scored 4 used, funky dining chairs from a co-worker headed for the dump. Daughter needs them so we're storing them til she moves after her wedding this fall. Will look at getting our dining chairs reupholstered. Too complicated for me with double edging.Just Like Grandma's-I rarely go into a Pier One store, too overpriced for me. I was by one the other day, and for some reason decided to go in. I wandered around for a few minutes, then BAM, a lightning bolt hit me. There in the table runners section was an almost exact copy of the place mats my Grandmother used for decades in her little kitchen dining area. We rarely used the formal dining room, except for holidays. Hers were woven by a weaver friend named Ray that we used to visit in Joshua Tree, in California. They are very reminiscent of rag rugs.  I spent many a year eating wonderful meals on those. These are actually made from used saris. I just couldn't believe what an almost exact match (except for size) it was. I had to buy it. Thanks for making me go in Grandma! Love it! I did some research and saw they actually have Chindi Placemats too!  I picked up four yesterday. Ah the memories....                                                     Girls come running for a treat!"},

{"title": "New Danger From Fukushima- Steam & Contaminated Water, Facebook Reader Question, 300th Blog Post Giveaway!!! ", "date": "Jul 23, 2013", "text": "I was reading this article Fukushima Contaminated Steam (text below) and it reminded me of my worries when this first happened. Nuclear accidents never happen in a vacuum. The article states-On July 17 and 18 steam was observed rising from Fukushima Daiichi Reactor 3, raising concerns that the damaged reactor's nuclear reaction had started again. If this has happened, another large release of radioactive material from the planet is probable. Then, yesterday, Tokyo Electric Power admitted that radioactive groundwater had leaked from the plant into the sea. Levels of cancer-causing cesium 134 have increased by 110 percent in the past few days. So far, Tepco has not been able to explain this increase, but it would be consistent with new nuclear reactions taking place in the reactor's core.Since 2011, low levels of cesium 134 have been found in blue fin tuna being caught off the California coast. In addition, seaweeds along the coast have been discovered to contain concentrations of radiation From Fukushima. Tokyo Electric Power has maintained a policy of informing the public as little as possible about the extent of the disaster. The Fukushima meltdowns took place after a massive tsunami swept the power plant complex in 2011. Tokyo Electric Power had received permission from planners to place its diesel backup generators at ground level instead of building them onto raised platforms, despite the fact that the area was a known risk for tsunamis. As a result of this, the plants lost backup power and went critical after the disaster. Since then, it has never been clear how much radiation has actually been leaked from them.Are Californians at risk if they eat blue fin tuna? Unlike heavier radioactive elements, Cesium-134 does not quickly sink to the bottom of the sea, but remains in the water column almost indefinitely. Blue fin tuna spawn in Japanese waters, then swim across the Pacific. By the time they reach California waters, any radioactive elements they may contain will have been concentrated by the amount of time the fish have been in the water.Facebook Reader Question-Here's a question for my readers- would you like to see a Facebook page that is for Little Homestead?

Harvest Something- Sumac heads, eggs, kale, about a qt. of choke cherries (happy dance, I smell jelly!), collard greens, blackberries, small hot peppers, first lemon tomatoes, and green apples from emergency tree trimming. Compost is doing nicely.choke cherries3. Preserve/Store Something- Made another batch of pickled eggs, and sweet tart onion relish.4. Manage Reserves- Get a Good Deal/Barter/Stock Up/Prep- Stocked up on cheese, fresh pineapple, Italian bread, cereal at Costco. Bought 2 batches of bird seed marked clearance at a big box store.5. Eat the Food- Try New Foods/Recipe- Tried a new Mayo cake, really salty and dried out way too fast. I got 2 new cookbooks from the library on French bistro cooking (review soon) and salads as meals, both by Patricia Wells6. Build Community Food Systems- Got more free rhubarb.7. Recycle/Re-Use- Compost, food scraps to the chickens. Will use green apples from tree trimming for some cobbler. They were much sweeter than I expected! Hoping for an early harvest before I'm back to work. Got some nice work tops at Goodwill today, oh boy! I'll be thrifting a lot more as I'm walking more.apples from trimming8. Skill Up- Learned how to make sumac lemonade. Also learned that if you're slicing a LOT of onions, let the water run in the sink. My eldest foodie daughter taught me that trick, and it WORKS!!! Doing problem solving on different fencing for next year to expand our veggie garden area. Want to add cedar posts instead of yard/garden stakes. Learned some new ways to keep the hens cool- bobbing for berries9. Regenerate What is Lost/Salvage Something- Apple and Sumac tree both needed major pruning. The apple tree is so loaded with fruit, and even with support, was at a bad angle over our easement. People drive thru there randomly, and didn't want to lose the tree. I had Dave selectively trim it and it looks much better! Ditto the sumac with the heavy seed pods, and a few low branches. Made some Sumac lemonade.Sumac Tree Lemonade-Last year I read about this, but never got around to it. Instead of waiting til fall for the sumac tree berry clusters, I used the heads as is now. There actually were berries under the fuzz. We had to trim them off anyway, for the sake of the tree, as they are heavy! I used this recipe- Sumac lemonade. There are plenty of others online. Just make sure it's the right kind of sumac. It came out a nice, pretty pink. The flavor as-is was lemon/berry-ish, which I didn't expect. Sweeten as needed.sumac heads soaking overnightI'm WALKING!-As most of you know I've been in recovery mode with my foot surgery. I had a big 1 1/2\" bone spur removed and Achilles tendon worked on. I've been doing pretty well this last week, with one crutch and partial weight-bearing. I'm seeing the doc about when I can do full weight bearing, with just my boot. THEN I can really get out, do yard work, shop, etc. Hopefully my lower back will stabilize too, pretty tough last 6 months with that."},

Since it was cooler yesterday, I went out in the back yard for an hour and read sitting in the sun. I decided my pasty white skin needed some color! I did wear a hat and shades, as I HATE a sunburned scalp. Being stuck inside with the recovery of my foot surgery has really been pretty much inside. Luckily I'm off my cart in 2 more days! Woohoo! Skin is finally healing up better in the small spot that was a problem. Then- just 1 crutch and I can finally drive myself, and do more here. Anyway, Thursday night I had Dave set out a couple of deck chairs- one by the deck to transfer off my cart to, and one out on the grass for me to roll over to. That went well, and I took out my hot weather supplies in my little cart basket- water bottle, book, phone, etc. It was so nice to be outside! I'm finishing up Making Home by Sharon Astyk. Excellent book! Sitting there for an hour I could hear bird sounds, a little hammering by a neighbor, cars off in the distance, kids laughing down the street. It was actually pretty quiet. It was a weekday with most of the neighbors off at work. Weekend summer sounds tend to be- lawnmowers, more hammering (neighbors got a project going), more birds, music, screaming babies, barking dogs, and the neighbor that has his pool vacuum going. Meanwhile the cat's running up and down the hall chasing a tiny wadded up ball of paper. Anya is so easily entertained!                                                          I love the BISCUITERIE signSweet Julia Child Tribute-I recently watched a cooking show and discovered who Patricia Wells is. Patricia is a well-known American writer who lives in France. She has written lots of French restaurant reviews, guides and cook books. She was good friends with Julia Child, the famous American cook who brought French cooking to America. I was really charmed by this little corner remembrance Patricia made to her friend. When Julia was getting ready to close up her French home for good Patricia asked if she could have her cook stove. The full story is here Julia Child's 100th Birthday. When I first watched Julie And Julia I really became aware of what a wonderful, tough, and funny woman Julia was. Watch the movie if you haven't! Amy Adams and Meryl Streep were brilliant! And, of course, blogger Julie Powell turned her cook the entire Child's cookbook in one year into fame and fortune. Good for her!Amy Adams as Julie, Child-type pearls and all. Wallpaper from ScenicReflectionsMeryl Streep as Julia Child in her French kitchenI already knew who Julia was from randomly watching her on PBS. She donated her entire American kitchen to the Smithsonian National Museum of American History. It really shows a \"working\" kitchen set up for organization, use and simplicity. You can take an online tour Julia Child Exhibit. I wish my kitchen was that big, and I love the cabinets and colors. Talk about a lot of utensils, cooking collectibles, etc.! Here's a fun little article from Country Living magazine on How to Recreate Julia Child's Kitchen.I remember watching SNL one year and almost dying from laughter at Dan Akroyd's imitation of her cutting up a chicken. He is sheer PERFECTION! BEWARE- if you're faint around blood, skip this! And try not to laugh yourself out of your chair!!!Almost Time For a Giveaway!-Two more posts to reach 300, then it's time!

I have 2 girls getting married in the next year, so I may borrow some aspects of that.

Dave's been great picking up the slack. Thanks for every one's good wishes!!! It's great to have a virtual cheering squad! I'm doing lots of little things around the house, and will get the stitches out next week. I'm looking forward to actually washing my foot normally, and not having it wrapped in plastic :(  I'm REALLY looking forward to being partial weight-bearing and just using one crutch and the \"boot. While the wheelie cart has been amazing (hardly using crutches except in the small bathroom) I'm looking forward to losing it. I'll be re-designing my blog soon, and changing the format, so watch for some changes. I may even do a reader survey! You can tell me what you like or not. My goal is to have it easy to read, and find what you need. I also want to change some of the artistic aspects like the colors, etc.1. Plant Something- Garden is pretty well planted. Watching for more tomato plants on sale. I always squeeze in more when they're 1/2 price or less.2. Harvest Something- Eggs, compost, ready to harvest kale and collard greens.3. Preserve/Store Something- Picked up a few things at Costco for the pantry and freezer.4. Manage Reserves- Get a Good Deal/Barter/Stock Up/Prep- Did some thrifting, will do more when foot is better. 5. Eat the Food- Try New Foods/Recipe- I heard about this on the radio today- Hot Sweet Tart Onion Relish I will make some, since it's supposed to be good on crackers, on top of cooked potatoes, etc. Easy and tasty sounding! Made a homemade angel food cake and buttermilk biscuits this week.6. Build Community Food Systems- Need to get in touch with our neighbor for some rhubarb. Done selling eggs for now.7. Recycle/Re-Use- Planting some leftover wildflower seeds I was gifted with. Dave planted last years leftover grass seed to fill in some dead spots. Our DVD/VHS machine dies, so I got rid of all the homemade tapes and donated the store bought ones. Sigh, it's an end of an era. Luckily I found several good, used DVDs on amazon!8. Skill Up- Taking a digital SLR photography class to use my camera better, it's great! Hubby and I are taking it together. Dave took it a few years back, but he has a better camera now. I'm learning a lot about proper settings, things like ISOs, F-stops, etc. Love the instructor! He believes you should be able to take GOOD photos and not have to photo shop everything. 9. Regenerate What is Lost/Salvage Something- Moving some plants/rocks around the backyard.                                                       Some of last year's bountyHow To Make Tomato Powder-Great idea here Baconandeggs/Scifichick While I  have no tomatoes yet, it's a great idea! I'd rather do that to some of my whole tomatoes, since I have to can outside. Too hot! I can set the dehydrator outside and do it that way. I love having paste on hand and that would fit the bill.Photo From 5 Little HomesteadersChicken Summer Cooling Pans-I ran across this yesterday at 5Littlehomesteaders.com  and I thought- great idea! You fill large plastic planter trays with water, then the chickens cool their feet in it. I'd never heard of this before. In Boise we get really hot and dry. While I've used a mister to create a damp area the girls won't actually stand under it. It does evaporate and gives them a cooler space though. I will try this, since it supposed to be pushing 100 in the next week, and report back."},

Good Homesteading/Chicken Books, Unusual Coops", "date": "Jun 19, 2013", "text": "Raining-We actually got some significant rain late last night and most of today, a surprise. It's been only about 60, and still cloudy. I opened up some windows to let the fresh air in, then closed them a bit later as it was pretty chilly. The clouds were breaking, a little blue sky, now a downpour and some thunder. Many time these summer storms blow through and we get wind, no rain, maybe just some thunder. Rain is nice....I'm Bored, Let's Bake!Being bored out of my mind, and finally off pain meds, I decided to bake. I need to use up some eggs for my favorite Citrus Angel Food Cake  I panicked when I realized I was out of cream of tartar, but there are easy substitutes for it. In this case, an equal part of lemon juice. No worries, it worked great! I also add about 1 tsp. of pure orange extract. This cake is so easy, you'll wonder why you never tried it sooner, if you haven't. It's addicting!                                            Good Homesteading/Chicken Books-I've worked on a few library books the last couple of weeks. I REALLY like this one, short and sweet-Finding Good Farmland , a Storey Basic book (love those). Hoping to someday move to a rural area, this one would be great for a novice like me, or someone more experienced. My favorite list was on page 73- Red Flags For a Problem Farm, really enlightening. Excellent read!                                  I also got from the Library, Free Range Chicken Gardens. This is a good read, with lots of ideas. There is more to the book than just gardens for chickens despite the title. Some of these ideas are great if you have lots of time, energy and $$$. It would be more beneficial if you were completely redoing your landscaping layout. On a budget you have to work with what you're given many times. I'm not a big fan of chicken poop everywhere either. Eh. I have already done many of these ideas, and this may vary climate-wise. There's no way I would do a lot of hardscaping with the hot summers here. I'm also not a big fan of gravel paths in general. My garden is frozen in the winter and so free-ranging in limited to the dirt veggie area. I wouldn't buy this personally, just check it out for the great eye candy. Most of the chicken information can be found free online.                                               My last chicken related book had lots of great ideas, City Chicks  It had much more interesting tidbits, including a chapter on teaching your chickens tricks! THAT I will be trying! I would really recommend this book. It's cool! I just wish the photos were in color.                                    Unusual Coops-I was going to post a few photos here, but then I struck gold! Hanburyhouse.com has a wonderful pages with designs from all over the world. There's more here too Facebook Chicken Coops  Here's a couple of my favorites-                                            From Thefancyfarmgirl.com, a bit over the top, but cute                                                                             From FB page                                                                          S.W.

Look Ma, no hands!!!!It's really frustrating not being able to do my normal thing, and keep things going smoothly and clean! Poor Dave was run ragged the last several days trying to keep me iced, medicated and fed. I'm really grateful I have the luxury of time off work and good insurance! I'm pretty much off my pain meds, and up and about more. I'm still getting tired easily, need to keep icing my foot, and I have to remind myself I had surgery less than a week ago. Stitches come out in 1 week, then another 2 weeks of no weight bearing. Hopefully after that I can go to partial with a crutch, then I could get outside in the back yard! I'm going to my Chiropractor tomorrow, who has really kept me band-aided together thru this. When you limp a lot on one side for a long time it really messes up your spine.

After my big bone spur is removed from my left heel, I'll be living in one of these for a while.-My foot will be elevated, iced and I'll be on the couch for a day or 2. Dressing comes off Friday, then I can shower. We got a shower chair at a thrift store! The good news, I have one of these, rented, for a while-You put your bum leg on the pad and can wheel around pretty fast! She's purty! I wish I'd had this 15 years ago, when I had the same thing, on the other foot. The really nice thing about the wheelie cart is you can lock the brakes and stand for a while. That will make cooking and various chores much easier and safer. I'm VERY grateful I have the summer off and have excellent insurance.Homemade Chicken Noodle Soup-Pretty cute in my thirfting bowls, huh? Eating while on pain pains the next day or two, I decided to make some chicken noodle soup. Nourishing and easy on the stomach.

Add everything except the noodles and paste. Bring to a boil, then simmer for 2 hours. Take the chicken out of the pot, carefully, then de-bone, and chop chicken. It will be hot, so cool a bit first. I used all the meat, but no skin. Put all the meat in the pot, bring to a simmer, add paste and salt to taste. Add noodles the last 1/2 hour before serving.  You could add sage and/or parsley too. Serve with some crackers or bread. Stores well, you may need to add more water when re-heating."},
{"title": "Keeping Chickens Cool, Thrifting Finds", "date": "Jun 7, 2013", "text": "Keeping Chickens Cool-This is my 3rd or 4th summer keeping chickens cool in a very hot, dry climate. In Boise it can stay in the 90's or 100's for weeks, sometimes months. Add to that we're in high desert, that's hot and DRY. Keeping chickens hydrated is essential. While I have big waterer in the coop, I also have 2 other large bowls I fill daily with fresh water. Sometimes I add a few ice cubes late in the day to cool it off.I also use some cool treats, like cukes, grapes/cherries (squash the grapes first so they won't choke), and an old pie pan I fill with ice chips. Luckily we have a fridge with in the door water and ice!I also added a shade area last year, since it had tough shrubs and was shade most of the day. I realized it would be a perfect to add a short fence. Sometimes you have to create a space. We re-used some fencing stakes and bought a small roll of garden fencing. The girls it every day! They can go from the main garden behind the coop and around. At some point I'd like to replace it with livestock panels and chicken wire, like the rest of the veggie area, and make the fencing more invisible. It works for now.In addition, I bought a mister for about $8.00 at a big box store. I attach it using the curly part of the top of the berry vine wires, and it keeps the whole area cooler. Uses very little water, a bonus. I'm a big fan of NOT wasting water. Just attach it to your hose, and turn on very low. That's it. Talk about an easy installation! Just unscrew when you need your hose.    Thrifting Finds-Summer is when I do a lot of thrifting, while I'm off work. When I was going by a thrift store today I popped in! I found a new summer blouse, a Sun Valley mug, 2 chicken soups bowls (good for post-foot surgery) and a summery pitcher. All for $12.00!  With foot surgery next week, and no weight bearing on my 1 foot and crutches for 4 weeks, I'll probably be home a lot. I have lots of little projects to do to keep me busy, but I'll miss some thrifting time. I'll make up for it when I'm off both crutches :)"},

I knew with the 90 degree weather coming we need to get thew planted so Dave and I planted after dinner, when it was mostly shady there. I knew we had to protect the veggies for a while or the hens would dig around them and disturb the roots. I bought \"rabbit fencing\" at a local feed store, cheap and perfect to keep their little heads out! $14.00 for 25', 28 \" high. It has smaller holes at the bottom and bigger at the top. I used the rest of last year's left over garden fencing, cut in 1/2 height-wise, then the rabbit fencing. It's easy to use wire cutters for this. Unrolling is easier with 2 people! I bought landscape fabric staples, 10 cents each to hold them in place. Worked great! Last year I had to work them into the soil and hope they held, not so stable. All of these things can be saved again for next year.rabbit fencinggarden fencing split in half.

I got burned out on Lipton's years ago as it was a bit bitter. I saw the hibiscus bulk tea we already had, and mint out in the yard. Presto! I looked up a recipe and found this Hibiscus Mint Iced Tea. Quick, easy and great! I added just a bit of sugar, but it was fine straight. You could adjust this and add lemon, or whatever. Nice and tangy, fruity, healthy, with loads of vitamin C. Enjoy!Scandinavian Flourless Chocolate Cake-I was ready up on the Primal Diet the other day. I had tried it last year and I really felt great! I just had mixed feelings about eating that much meat. It's not for everyone, but I agree with his views that most people eat WAY too many carbs. Then I remembered then that I had this Scandinavian Flourless Chocolate Cake recipe. It uses ground almonds instead of flour. The recipe says finely chopped, but grind it in a blender or food processor, you want it fine. It's pretty easy, and I used our wonderful eggs. I always use Ghiradelli bittersweet chocolate for this kind of thing. I makes for a much more adult flavor, although my kids always liked it. It's easy to find in the baking section.  I melted the chocolate mixture in the microwave for 1 minute, stirred well, then another 30 seconds.

Keep stirring until warm and then add 2/3 the chocolate chips. Bring all to a nice, fully melted gooey sauce. Make sure ALL the chips are completely melted.

I chilled about 3 hours or so. Cut with sharp knife, keep covered. Yummy!Best Frittata-When you have lots of fresh eggs, it's time for a frittata dinner! This was the best one so far, with no official recipe, but here's what I remember-preheat oven to 400, using a large cast iron skillet, spray with non-stick spray. In a bowl beat 12 eggs, 1/2 cup milk. Chop up 5 lg. green onions, 1/2 cup roasted red peppers, 1 small zucchini. Set aside- 1/2 cup goat cheese blobs, 1/3 cup feta cheese, 1/2 package (2ozs.?) thin sliced prosciutto. Saute veggies until soft in a little olive oil, add feta, then add eggs, then goat cheese on top, then prosciutto. Cook on stove top on med. high until about 1/2 set. Put in oven for about 20-25 minutes or until eggs are set. Serve and enjoy! I served with garlic bread and salad.More Veggies To Plant-I always plant tomatoes first, then see how much see I have left. I have to also plan in some chicken protection. So we bought some- Ichiban eggplants, 2 kinds of yellow squash, lemon cukes (my favorite!). I made the mistake of planting 2 more raspberries, only to have the girls repeatedly dig them up. I finally secured chicken wire with stakes and was able to salvage one. I dug up 2 of our own starts and added them to the space. I bought thorn less, but may wind up with thorns, oh well.

You can tell you're an urban homesteader by what your kids give you! I got some tomatoes and veggies there, and got the rest at a couple of other places. I bought 5 Red Russian kales for $2.50 at a little local garden center. He said he just wanted to get rid of them! Works for me!!! Nice color below-We also bought a few shrubs to fill in some holes and for a spot in the front yard.

Since we already had 2 Black Knight varieties (dark blue/purple) we bought 1 Butterfly Heaven, smaller bluish flowers (on the top of this post).

After photos soon....Too Much Technology For Kids-I read a post on Ohmrstucker.com on a new book called Goodnight iPad. It got me thinking. Here's my response:As a school librarian I love the book It’s A Book by Lane Smith. The short version in on YouTube. I read the book to my 6th graders to remind them that there’s no electricity involved and that it actually has many more advantages. For kids there may be some future problems with using tech at a young age too- what will they do if they don’t have access to that later? Public schools can’t afford to buy kids iPads just because they want to use one in school. How many parents are going to trust a elementary kid to take theirs to school? Who will pay for it if it gets broken/stolen/damaged?I can’t afford an iPad, and if I did, I wouldn’t buy one. I have 2 computers at home and 2 at work. It’s just too much.  I have lost count how many times I have almost been hit by cars whose drivers are texting. There’s also such a disparity between people who just assume all families can even AFFORD these. I work with 85 % high poverty kids. Only about 30% of them even have the internet at home. $500.00 for an iPad is groceries and rent for them. There’s a huge disconnect (excuse the pun) in tech where wealthier folks just assume everyone else has one. Or wants one, in my case. I love the convenience of tech, but it’s too much- $, maintenance, wear and tear, storage. I don’t have to worry about dropping a book, getting it a little wet (assuming I own it), highlighting it, tearing out a page, my software crashing (a friend lost his entire kindle off his iPad), re-charging, or worry about theft. I could go on. It just needs to be put into perspective sometimes. ***Remember- with no electricity, it’s just an expensive piece of plastic.Ellie enjoying the sun"},

I out the butterfly over her head for a break from the rain and sun :) I already bought some new components, including the  round solar light.Thyme, rosemary and oregano on the deck box, basil seeds started in the 2 potsNew Furnace/AC-After our AC pooped out recently we knew we had to bite the bullet and get a new furnace too, as you ideally want to do both together. We knew the furnace was also pretty old, about 35 years, and somewhat inefficient. I love doing research before a big investment and gathering data so I subscribed (by the month) to Consumer Reports. I like looking at their reliability reports, always an eye-opener. We wound up getting several bids and asking around. The biggest warning I read was to make sure it's installed correctly or it can void out your warranty. We went with an established company and got 2 Trane units. Much more efficient, and should save us on our monthly energy bill. Nice and quiet and MUCH better air quality too. We're all set.Independence Days Challenge-1. Plant Something- Planning on planting our summer veggies starting this weekend. There was a frost warning last night, go figure! It's been a regular roller coaster temp-wise. Started basil seeds in 2 pots for lots this summer.2. Harvest Something-Eggs, compost, chives, cool weather crops growing nicely. Did a massive pruning on the blackberries, raspberries and marionberries. Lots of dead vines.3. Preserve/Store Something-Made my elderberry syrup, Dave's taking some for a cough. Still freezing things- got a great deal at the Grocery Outlet on local/gourmet bread and froze 2 loaves. Also got some various bathroom supplies, and quick lunch stuff (Annie's Organic) there too.4.

It really comes from a different angle about issues of living more self sufficient, as well as building communities, living green in a way that would work if things change. And they will, it's a matter of how, where and when. Sharon lays out very thoughtful ideas about not going green to save the planet (since we're screwed IMO) but to be able to live well by using what we already have, and/or modifying our lives and attitudes. This is a positive message about thinking outside the box and prepping (of sorts). One of my favorite lines so far is a quote by James H. Kunstler, on page 11- \"... we become so attached to the things we have invested ourselves in that we go on preserving them long after such preservation has become destructive.\" She gives lots of great ideas on \"planning for a future and failure\". examples about things like: transportation, growing food, heating/cooling, creatures, skills, work and $, and security. After our A/C died a week ago it got me thinking. We didn't do too bad, while in the 90's. We already had installed ceiling fans, insulated drapes and kept the house closed during the day. You never know when something will happen or change. We would have suffered if we hadn't thought ahead!Great book! Go read it!!!"},

I bought 2 lbs. for about $7.00 each, with shipping. MUCH cheaper than buying the extract. I used the sugar preservative recipe and it really was simple. I doubled the recipe and used 1/2 cup berries to 4 cups of water. When I was done it was exactly 2 cups-Kept it the fridge, it's nice and thick.Very deep red/brown color, with a distinctive taste. I'll try some on waffles soon!  My New Couch!-We were really needing a new couch and a couple of chairs for the living room. We decided to take the plunge this spring and get a nicer, really heavy duty couch. She was delivered today, what a beauty! Nice sage green and it's Anya approved. We chose the colors for the pillows (there's 2) and I went with something fun and summery, since I already have wintery pillows-It's a bit brighter, and a little shiny, in real life- orange, green and blue/grays, cute!"},

I used some on the chicken and the rest on a avocado and greens salad, along with some corn chips. Excellent! I would add more adobo next time for more heat, or cayenne.$175.00 Etsy VersionOur Etsy On The Cheap Cedar & Tin Planter-I asked Dave to build a cedar deck box so we could get rid of the various beat up plastic tubs we had. I googled cedar deck boxes and saw this- etsy.com Cedar & Tin Planter Then I saw the price- $175.00, OMG! So I showed it to Dave and we decided to build our own! For about $35.00 Dave built this-Our $35.00 version, built in 3 hoursWe looked at the photos off Etsy, and he came up with this. It's nailed together rather than stapled, more durable. He used fir 2x4's underneath, since we couldn't find cedar. He used 2x2's on the inside. He made cedar feet for it as well. He accidentally bought the wider cedar for the sides, but I actually like it better. There's less metal visible. He also raised the floor, using leftover plywood, which uses a lot less potting soil. He drilled holes for drainage. We only used 1/2 of the 2' x 2' x 8' metal roofing, so I'm going to do a fencing decoration with the rest of it. I'll post a pic when it's done. I'm going to take an old shovel, add hooks and mount it near the top, and attach to the fence. A little rustic embellishment. Here are the steps he used to build it-Basic box with the floorAdding metal roofing, he used a jigsaw to cut it.

{"title": "Independence Days Challenge, Losing Rosie", "date": "May 3, 2013", "text": "Independence Days Challenge-1. Plant Something- Lettuces, collard greens, Swiss chard, French radishes. I'll plant the summer garden in the next month- tomatoes, peppers, eggplants, cukes, etc. Ready to prune the berries from the winter die back. We're looking at ripping up some ground covers and perennials in the front yard parking strip and replacing with veggies. I just don't have any clear ideas yet. Will bring out my pots for the back desk and start some herbs again. Got some free Dr. Seuss Lorax wildflower seeds for Earth Day. I'll scatter them on our perimeter.2. Harvest Something- Eggs, pine shavings for the garden from the coop.3. Preserve/Store Something- Still adding foods to the freezer. Will make Elderberry syrup to store.4. Manage Reserves- Get a Good Deal/Barter/Stock Up/Prep- It's so great to still have freezer room, as we eat out of it. I've bought pot stickers, cheeses, flautas, tortillas, etc. and stashed. I bought more Nestle's Table Cream (canned cream) after trying it one night over fresh strawberries, yum! Just chill and it's really close to cream, just a little lighter. It's just canned cream. Great for storage in warm areas. Good to have on hand for all kinds of recipes. At Walmart it's about $1.25 a can if I remember right. Got 2 lbs. of dried Elderberries for syrup making.5. Eat the Food- Try New Foods/Recipe- It's been great using my home canned or frozen- rhubarb sauce, jams, jellies, and pesto. I've been making a LOT of fish taco with a lime sauce. They're addicting!6. Build Community Food Systems- Still selling eggs at work. I had to take a break after a round of worming. No eggs for 10 days afterwards. Sad putting them down the garbage disposal :(  I'll ask my neighbor for more of her rhubarb that just sits there and rots. She was happy to get rid of it!7. Recycle/Re-Use- Dave deep cleaned the shed and our little lumber storage area last weekend. After getting the coop finished he wanted to get rid of the surplus. Luckily he can get more free lumber form work if he plans ahead. He started to put some cut up cedar in the trash and I said NO WAY! I made him out it out on the street with a free sign. It was gone in under an hour. I figured someone could use it for crafts or burn it to heat their home. More composting going on, scraps to girls.8. Skill Up- Learning more about making Elderberry syrup (post coming soon) and treating sick chickens , again. Ugh...9. Regenerate What is Lost/Salvage Something- Might re-do the front yard a bit. From Poetryandacupoftea.blogspot.com  I love the fairy pot!Losing Rosie-Rosie is my only remaining hen from my original flock. I lost 2 to worms and the other to an unknown illness. Keeping your first flock healthy is a real learning curve. I learned the hard way to check your chickens DAILY. Look for signs of stress and injury. Short version- Rosie was looking really lethargic several days ago. She had worms again. I brought her in, but she didn't respond to the worming. I think there's an underlying cause, which is impossible to treat. I'm not going to take her to a vet (even if I could find one). I wormed her, gave her lots of fluids, antibiotics, soft/wet foods, kept her inside, etc. No luck. I finally accepted the fact she's probably not going to make it. I cried a lot. When you have a small flock and hand-raise them from a few days old, and have them for 5 years, you get attached. At least I do. So, I put her outside last night, since it warmed up, and she was probably depressed being alone. This afternoon when I got home I gave the girls some leftover fish, and she stumbled out and ate some. She actually drank some water on her own. She's so weak she almost fell over, poor thing. And so pale. Who know? Maybe she'll bounce back, but I don't think so.... I told her it was ok to go and that I love her. That's all I can do right now..."},

{"title": "Homemade Elderberry Syrup, Henny The Poo, \"Making Home\" Book", "date": "Apr 20, 2013", "text": "Homemade Elderberry Syrup-In the scheme of wanting to make more homemade supplements, etc, I found this post- Everything You Want to Know About Elderberry Syrup, courtesy of Frippery Farm. I LOVE Pure Cajun Sunshine's blog, looks like she stopped posting after a horrible snakebite. I hope she's ok, cause there's lot of fun stuff there! Anyway, after going thru two rounds of bronchitis and a cold with 2 weeks in  between where I thought I was ok, it's time to make elderberry syrup. It will be good to have on hand. I went thru a doctor visit, 2 rounds of back-to-back antibiotics just to finally get rid of it. My doc says it's the worst flu season she's seen, with a lot of other people going thru the same thing, back-to-back infections. I found some dried berries online here Herbalcom.com I've ordered some and am going to follow the recipe list on the first link. I'll post photos when I'm done. It's so MUCH cheaper, and fresher, to do this yourself. The sugar-based syrup sounds like it has a pretty good shelf life. I can see using this during flu season to boost the immune system in general, and sounds like it would be good for other types of infections. Great on pancakes too!!!RosieThe Adventures of Henny The Poo-Sorry, I couldn't resist. If you raise chickens you have to clean them up once in a while. If you don't know how to do this yet, it's actually very easy and may save you a lot of grief with a very sick, or dead, chicken. Thus was the case with Rosie, no photos, so don't worry about hurling! Last week I saw a big (like an egg almost) round poo ball hanging off her little feathered butt. So.............. off for a bucket of warm soapy (a little dish soap) and an old washcloth. It was mild outside. In the winter I would have done this inside and sanitized everything afterwards. So..................... you get the chicken in place, I held her under my left arm facing away from me, since I'm right handed. Grab very sopping/dripping washcloth and get it very wet. Bend over a little so you don't get the mes on YOUR shoes :)  Then start very gently massaging. After about one minute or less, chunks started coming off. Keep dipping rag. All gone! Now I have a clean chicken with a very wet end. I set her down and went in to get some paper towels. Rosie kept trying to look back like \"what the heck just happened to me? My butt is wet!\". I dried her off very gently, as her poor rear end looked a bit irritated. She dried off nicely fairly fast. Next day she looked perfect. A good reminder- check your chickens. This can actually kill your bird, I'm not kidding. Next time I'll take pictures, maybe. I will add- the girls have lots of fresh, clean water and good quality food. Shit just happens. Sorry, I couldn't resist.                            Making Home Book-When I saw Sharon Astyk had written a new book Making Home- Adapting Our Homes And Our Lives to Settle in Place I knew I had to buy it. I took Sharon's food preservation online class last spring, and she's awesome! I'm just getting into it, but it has great ideas for people like me who want to grow and store their own foods, etc. It also talks about learning new skills, security and all kinds of useful stuff."},

{"title": "During An Illness- How Not To Say The Wrong Thing", "date": "Apr 10, 2013", "text": "During An Illness- How Not To Say The Wrong Thing-The following article really hit home with me, as I have been on both sides! I think it's excellent advice-It works in all kinds of crises – medical, legal, even existential. It's the 'Ring Theory' of kvetching. The first rule is comfort in, dump out. By Susan Silk and Barry GoldmanWhen Susan had breast cancer, we heard a lot of lame remarks, but our favorite came from one of Susan's colleagues. She wanted, she needed, to visit Susan after the surgery, but Susan didn't feel like having visitors, and she said so. Her colleague's response? \"This isn't just about you.\"It works in all kinds of crises – medical, legal, even existential. It's the 'Ring Theory' of kvetching. The first rule is comfort in, dump out.\"It's not?\" Susan wondered. \"My breast cancer is not about me? It's about you?\"The same theme came up again when our friend Katie had a brain aneurysm. She was in intensive care for a long time and finally got out and into a step-down unit. She was no longer covered with tubes and lines and monitors, but she was still in rough shape. A friend came and saw her and then stepped into the hall with Katie's husband, Pat. \"I wasn't prepared for this,\" she told him. \"I don't know if I can handle it.\"This woman loves Katie, and she said what she did because the sight of Katie in this condition moved her so deeply. But it was the wrong thing to say. And it was wrong in the same way Susan's colleague's remark was wrong.Susan has since developed a simple technique to help people avoid this mistake. It works for all kinds of crises: medical, legal, financial, romantic, even existential. She calls it the Ring Theory.Draw a circle. This is the center ring. In it, put the name of the person at the center of the current trauma. For Katie's aneurysm, that's Katie. Now draw a larger circle around the first one. In that ring put the name of the person next closest to the trauma. In the case of Katie's aneurysm, that was Katie's husband, Pat. Repeat the process as many times as you need to. In each larger ring put the next closest people. Parents and children before more distant relatives. Intimate friends in smaller rings, less intimate friends in larger ones. When you are done you have a Kvetching Order. One of Susan's patients found it useful to tape it to her refrigerator.Here are the rules. The person in the center ring can say anything she wants to anyone, anywhere. She can kvetch and complain and whine and moan and curse the heavens and say, \"Life is unfair\" and \"Why me?\" That's the one payoff for being in the center ring.Everyone else can say those things too, but only to people in larger rings.When you are talking to a person in a ring smaller than yours, someone closer to the center of the crisis, the goal is to help. Listening is often more helpful than talking. But if you're going to open your mouth, ask yourself if what you are about to say is likely to provide comfort and support. If it isn't, don't say it. Don't, for example, give advice. People who are suffering from trauma don't need advice. They need comfort and support. So say, \"I'm sorry\" or \"This must really be hard for you\" or \"Can I bring you a pot roast?\" Don't say, \"You should hear what happened to me\" or \"Here's what I would do if I were you.\" And don't say, \"This is really bringing me down.\"If you want to scream or cry or complain, if you want to tell someone how shocked you are or how icky you feel, or whine about how it reminds you of all the terrible things that have happened to you lately, that's fine. It's a perfectly normal response. Just do it to someone in a bigger ring.Comfort IN, dump OUT.There was nothing wrong with Katie's friend saying she was not prepared for how horrible Katie looked, or even that she didn't think she could handle it. The mistake was that she said those things to Pat. She dumped IN.Complaining to someone in a smaller ring than yours doesn't do either of you any good. On the other hand, being supportive to her principal caregiver may be the best thing you can do for the patient.Most of us know this. Almost nobody would complain to the patient about how rotten she looks. Almost no one would say that looking at her makes them think of the fragility of life and their own closeness to death. In other words, we know enough not to dump into the center ring. Ring Theory merely expands that intuition and makes it more concrete: Don't just avoid dumping into the center ring, avoid dumping into any ring smaller than your own.Remember, you can say whatever you want if you just wait until you're talking to someone in a larger ring than yours.And don't worry. You'll get your turn in the center ring. You can count on that.Susan Silk is a clinical psychologist.

{"title": "Chicken Coop Re-Do, and Then Some!", "date": "Mar 27, 2013", "text": "Chicken Coop Re-Do and Then Some!-I mentioned a few weeks back that we were going to re-do our coop. The small size is nice and compact, but too hard to clean and maintain. Hubby and my backs don't do well in that small space. So.... wait for it....... we decided to re-build and expand it. When you're a DIY-er the first thing you do is make a plan! We wanted the same footprint, just taller, and with more roosting room. We also wanted to add the hinge to the nesting box on the bottom to eliminate leakage. Dave added a wood floor for 1/2 the coop, to have a clean area the girls wouldn't dig thru. After Dave designed the re-do (with input from me of course!) he started looking for materials. We got a lot of used materials free, and thru the Habitat for Humanity Re-Store. We also went to SHIP, a local used materials store benefiting a clean and sober facility. I actually found the $10.00 cedar/lattice custom made door, marked down from $110.00!Dave figures we used about 80% - 90% used or hugely reduced, like the shingles- about 20% of new. We had to buy 2 sheets of plywood, a couple of 2x4's and normal hardware- screws, nails, caulking. I bought a gallon of the same color paint as we were low. We figure the total cost NEW would have been between $800.00- $1,000 or so. We spent about 1/4 of that, a good investment for us. I will say- we both thought it took a lot longer than we thought it would. It was a 3 day job instead of the one building the walls, then getting everything else done. When you're a DIY-er and working with used materials, it can take longer to cobble it all together.So here the pics, and it's not painted yet, or prettified, so more soon!

Plant Something- Will start seeds soon. We'll be setting up our new/used/free shelf system Dave got free at work last year. Get some lights and we'll be all set! I'll be able to start all kinds of seeds indoors now, and NOT under my kitchen under-cabinet lights! Took up way too much counter space last year.2. Harvest Something- Eggs, still working on the compost.3. Preserve/Store Something- Still getting good deals and stashing in the chest freezer. Such a good investment!4. Manage Reserves- Get a Good Deal/Barter/Stock Up/Prep- Ditto, keeping the pantry well-stocked of basics.5. Eat the Food- Try New Foods/Recipe- Tried some local Momo's, yummy. Like dumplings, but from Nepal. Eating lots from the freezer. I made a strawberry/rhubarb cobbler Sunday with some of the free rhubarb I got from my neighbor last summer. Held up great in the freezer! Still working on my jams, jellies, and pickles from last summer.6. Build Community Food Systems- Had to worm the flock, so no eggs sales this last week, but will start in a couple of days. Will work on buying/bartering more fruits/veggies from friends and neighbors this spring/summer, for canning and drying.7. Recycle/Re-Use- Got some nice used stuff off eBay- purse, blouse. Found a new Ikea comforter cover only $20.00 for a queen size! Still composting, got the new compost bucket out (we don't compost scraps in the winter) and starting up again. Scraps to the girls.8. Skill Up- I learned all about leather care after buying a used Fossil purse. Saddle soap worked great, and good neutral leather conditioner did a nice job rehydrating the leather. Now knowing how to gauge what a sick chicken may have going on, I was able to save one of my girls from a really nasty worm infestation. Learning that skill a while back made for a smooth and easy treatment. I don't think she would have lasted more than a few more days maybe. She had really started to waste away, poor girl. It really pays to have an emergency chicken kit on hand, ready to go. She's just like new now!9. Regenerate What is Lost/Salvage Something- We're going to raise the roof on the coop in the next week, to make it a little bigger and much easier to clean. Small ones are great and low profile, but hard to get into. Dave has found a huge amount of free and used lumber, etc. at the local Habitat store. I'll post photos of the re-build. The girls should love it- more roosting space and airier."},

{"title": "Factors For Backyard Egg Production ", "date": "Mar 13, 2013", "text": "Factors For Backyard Egg ProductionSince some of my hens have had their ups and downs egg-laying wise (and Rosie is in retirement) I looked up some info. I found this, very informative!Factors Affecting Egg Production in Backyard Chicken FlocksJ.P. Jacob, H.R. Wilson, R.D. Miles, G. D. Butcher, and F.B. Mather2The laying cycle of a chicken flock usually covers a span of about 12 months. Egg production begins when the birds reach about 18-22 weeks of age, depending on the breed and season. Flock production rises sharply and reaches a peak of about 90%, 6-8 weeks later. Production then gradually declines to about 65% after 12 months of lay. A typical production curve for a laying flock, showing changes in the level of egg production and in egg weight, over time, is given inFigure 1.Figure 1. There are many factors that can adversely affect egg production. Unraveling the cause of a sudden drop in egg production requires a thorough investigation into the history of the flock. Egg production can be affected by such factors as feed consumption (quality and quantity),water intake, intensity and duration of light received, parasite infestation, disease, and numerous management and environmental factors.Noninfectious CausesAging HensChickens can live for many years and continue to lay eggs for many of these years. However,after two or three years many hens significantly decline in productivity (seeFigure 2). This varies greatly from bird to bird. Good layers will lay for about 50 to 60 weeks and then have a rest period called a molt. Poorer layers and older hens will molt more often and lay less consistently. SeeTable 1.Figure 2. Improper NutritionLaying chickens require a completely balanced diet to sustain maximum egg production over time.Inadequate nutrition can cause hens to stop laying. Inadequate levels of energy, protein or calcium can cause a drop in egg production. This is why it is so important to supply laying hens with a constant supply of nutritionally balanced layer food. Feeding whole grains, scratch feeds and table scraps will cause the birds diet to become imbalanced and inadequate.Many times these imbalances can cause other problems like oviductal prolapse. Prolapse may occur when the bird is too fat and/or an egg is too large and the bird's reproductive tractis expelled with the egg. Prolapse usually causes permanent damage to the hen and is fatal in many cases.Omission Of Feed IngredientsSaltAnimals have an innate desire to consume salt. Feeding a salt-deficient diet will lead to increased feather pecking and a decline in egg production. Most animal feeds will contain added salt, usually in the form of sodium chloride. Iodineis rarely added as a separate ingredient. Instead, iodized salt is routinely used. Cobaltiodized salt is often used in diets for swine and ruminants, and this can also be used without any problems for poultry. This type of salt is usually blue.Sodium is an essential nutrient, playing a major role in maintaining body fluid volume, blood pH, and proper osmotic relationships. A continuously low intake of salt can cause a loss of appetite. Sodium deficiencies adversely affect utilization of dietary protein and energy,and interfere with reproductive performance. Chlorine is also an essential nutrient. Hydrogen chloride (HCl) released from the true stomach(proventriculus) is important in digestion. Chlorine also plays a role in maintaining osmoticbalance in body fluids. Birds deficient in chlorine are more nervous, showing increased sensitivity to sudden noise.CalciumThe egg shell is composed primarily of calcium carbonate. The pullet's requirement for calcium is relatively low during the growing period, but when the first eggs are produced, the need is increased at least four times, with practically all of the increase being used for the production of eggshells. Inadequate calcium consumption will result in decreased egg production and lower egg shell quality. Hens store calcium in medullary bone, a specialized bone capable of rapid calcium turnover. As calcium stores are depleted, bones become brittle. In severe cases, hens are unable to stand. The condition is known as caged-layer fatigue. Birds on the ground or on litter floors recycle calcium and phosphorus through consumption of feces, and do not have caged-layer fatigue.Calcium can be supplied in the diet as either ground limestone or oyster shell. Particle size affects calcium availability. Usually the larger the particle size, the longer the particle will be retained in the upper digestive tract. This means that the larger particles of the calcium source are released more slowly, and this may be important for the continuity of shell formation, especially in the dark period when birds do not ordinarily eat. Periodically, dolomitic limestone is offered to the feed industry. However, dolomitic limestone(which is used in the steel industry) should never be used in poultry diets. Dolomitic limestone contains at least 10% magnesium, and this complexes with calcium or competes with calcium for absorption sites in the intestines. The consequence of feeding dolomitic limestone is induced calcium deficiency.Young birds should not be fed a high calcium layer diet because the calcium/phosphorus ratio will be unbalanced, resulting in increased morbidity or mortality.Vitamin DVitamin D is required for normal calcium absorption and utilization. If inadequate levels of vitamin D are fed, induced calcium deficiency quickly results and egg production decreases. Feed grade vitamin D comes in two forms, D2 and D3. In most animals, both are equally potent. In birds, however, D3 is substantially more active than D2. In poultry diets, therefore, vitamin D must be supplied in the form of D3.ProteinDietary requirements for protein are actually requirements for the amino acids that constitute the protein. There are 22 amino acids in body proteins, and all are physiologically essential. Poultry cannot synthesize some of these, or cannot synthesize them rapidly enough to meet the metabolic requirement. Therefore, these amino acids must be supplied in the diet. Amino acid requirements vary considerably according to the productive state (i.e., growing, laying eggs, etc.), age, type, breed, and strain. Methionine is the amino acid most often deficient in laying rations. When pullets begin laying, there is an increase in protein, vitamin and mineral requirements per day due to deposition in the egg. If dietary protein is too low or the amino acid requirements are not met, poor egg production and hatchability will occur.FatDietary fat is a source of energy and of linoleic acid, an essential fatty acid. A deficiency of linoleic acid will adversely affect egg production. Dietary fats also serve as \"carriers\"of fat-soluble vitamins, and some fat is necessary for absorption of vitamins. In fact, impairment of the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K) is the most serious consequence of a dietary deficiency of fat.ToxicosesSaltAlthough the salt requirement of birds is relatively low, adequate levels are essential, and excessive amounts are highly toxic and reduce egg production. Birds require a sensitive balance between necessary and toxic levels of salt. SeeTable 1.Excess dietary salt intake readily causes wet droppings and wet litter. Several feed ingredients,such as fish meal, corn gluten meal, meat meal, whey and sunflower meal contain high levels of sodium. When such ingredients are used, the level of supplemental salt (NaCl) in the diet must be reduced.PhosphorusThe nutritional role of phosphorus is closely related to that of calcium. Both are constituents of bone. The ratio of dietary calcium to phosphorus affects the absorption of both these elements;an excess of either one impedes absorption and can reduce egg production, shell quality and/or hatchability. In addition to its function in bone, phosphorus plays a primary role in carbohydrate metabolism,is active in fat metabolism, and helps to regulate the acid-base balance of the body.Vitamin DExcess vitamin D3 leads to increased calcium absorption resulting in hypercalcemia which may reduce egg production.Most animal species appear to be able to tolerate 10 times their vitamin D3 requirement for long periods of time. For short-periods of time, poultry can tolerate up to 100 times their requirement. An excess of vitamin D3 in the diet, therefore, is unlikely.MycotoxinsMolds can produce mycotoxins which adversely affect egg production and general health. They can interfere with the absorption or metabolism of certain nutrients, depending on the particularmycotoxin. Apparent calcium and/or vitamin D3 deficiencies can occur when mycotoxin contaminated feeds are given to laying hens. In addition,some have hormonal effects which can cause a decline in egg production. The major mycotoxin of concern with corn is aflatoxin, produced by the moldAspergillus flavus. The mold infects corn both in the field and in storage. Aflatoxin fluoresces under ultraviolet light, so its presence can be detected by examining grain under \"black light\". Othermycotoxins sometimes associated with corn and other grains are zearalenone (F-2 toxin), ochratoxin,T-2 toxin, vomitoxin, and citrinin. More than 300 mycotoxins have been identified.BotulismBotulism is an acute intoxication caused by consumption of a neurotoxin produced by the bacteriumClostridium botulinum. It commonly occurs when birds consume decomposing carcasses, spoiled feed or other decaying organic materials. Ponds and other stagnant water sources are often areas of decaying materials that may contain this toxin.Other toxinsNumerous plants are toxic to varying degrees if plant parts or seeds are consumed by the bird. Production, hatchability, growth, and livability may be reduced. Examples of these plants include crotalaria, nightshade, coffeeweed, cotton seeds, chick peas, vetches, and many ornamentals.Other potential causes of problems include pesticides, herbicides, disinfectants, fertilizers,drugs, antibiotics, and other chemicals, including oils and antifreeze.AnticoccidialsAnticoccidials (to prevent coccidiosis) are commonly used in diets for replacement pullets,meat birds and young breeding stock that are reared on litter floors. Anticoccidials are not given to commercial laying hens.NicarbazinNicarbazin is an anticoccidial drug that reduces reproductive performance when it's inadvertently added to layer or breeder diets at normal anticoccidial levels. The yolk membranes are weakened,resulting in mottling of the yolk. Nicarbazin fed to brown-egg layers turns their egg shells white within 48 hours, although this is completely reversible when the product is withdrawn from the feed. Even low levels of nicarbazin can cause some loss in shell color, mottling of egg yolks (see Fact Sheet PS-24, \"Egg Quality\"), and a decline in hatchability.MonensinMonensin has been the most successful of the anticoccidials. Monensin, and other ionophoreanticoccidials, have an adverse effect on egg production when used in conjunction with low protein diets.Management MistakesOut of feedIf hens are out of feed for several hours, a decline in egg production will probably occur. The amount of decline will be related to the time without feed. Be sure that all the birds have access to an adequate supply of a complete feed which meets all their nutritional requirements. Feed stored on the farm longer than two weeks may become moldy. If feed becomes wet it should be discarded. In addition, vitamin potency decreases with prolonged storage.Out of waterWater is often taken for granted, and yet it is probably the most essential nutrient. Water is by far the single constituent of the body, and, in general, represents about 70% of total body weight. Access to water is very important, and a lack of water for several hours will probably cause a decline in egg production. Hens are more sensitive to a lack of water than alack of feed.The amount of water needed depends on environmental temperature and relative humidity, diet composition, and rate of egg production. It has been generally assumed that birds drink approximately twice as much water as the amount of feed consumed on a weight basis, but water intake varies greatly, especially in hot weather.Inadequate day lengthHens need about 14 hours of day length to maintain egg production. The intensity of light should be sufficient to allow a person to read newsprint at bird level. The decreasing day length during the Fall and shorter day lengths in the Winter would be expected to cause a severe decline,or even cessation, in egg production unless supplemental light is provided. When production ceases, the birds may also undergo a feather molt. Hens exposed to only natural light would be expected to resume egg production in the Spring.High house temperaturesHigh environmental temperatures pose severe problems for all types of poultry. Feed consumption,egg production, egg size, and hatchability are all adversely affected under conditions of severe heat stress. Shade, ventilation, and a plentiful supply of cool water help reduce the adverse effects of heat stress.EctoparasitesAn ectoparasite is a parasitic organism that feeds on the exterior of the body of the host.Northern fowl miteThe northern fowl mite (Ornithonyssus sylviarum) is the most common of the poultry mites. Refer to the publication PS-10, (\"Common Continuous External Parasites of Poultry\"), for information on identification and control of Northern fowl mites.Northern fowl mites are blood suckers and are irritating to poultry. Anemia occurs in heavily parasitized birds, reducing feed efficiency, egg production, and ability to withstand and overcome diseases.LiceSeveral species of chewing lice may be found on chickens, especially those in small flocks or on range. Refer to publication PS-10, (\"Common Continuous External Parasites of Poultry\"),for information on identification and control of lice.Chicken lice feed on dry scales, feathers, or scabs on the skin. As lice crawl over the bird,their mouth parts and sharp claws scratch the skin. The constant irritation causes the bird to become nervous and behave abnormally, causing a general unthriftiness and unkempt appearance in the bird. Egg production in infested flocks may drop as much as 10%, although some heavy infestations have caused egg production to fall as much as 20%.FleasStick-tight fleas are sometimes a severe problem in home flocks and may be difficult to prevent or eradicate. The adult female flea attaches to the skin around the face and head, causing severe irritation and, in some cases, blindness. Refer to publication PS-10, (\"Common Continuous External Parasites of Poultry\"), for information on identification and control of stick-tight fleas.EndoparasitesAn endoparasite is a parasite that lives and feeds inside the host animal. Heavy infestations of endoparasites can cause unthriftiness, poor feed efficiency, poor growth,reduced egg production, and mortality in severe infestations. Infected birds may also be more susceptible to various diseases and stresses.NematodesNematodes, or roundworms, are elongated, cylindrical, unsegmented endoparasites. There are many species of roundworms, each tending to infect a specific area of the gastrointestinal tract. Refer to publication PS-18, (\"Nematode Parasites of Poultry\"), for identification and control of nematodes.TapewormsTapeworms (cestodes) are white or yellowish ribbon-like segmented flat worms. They vary in size from 0.17 to 12 inches in length. Although tapeworms do not produce extensive lesions or damage to the intestines, they are nutritional competitors. A cestode does not digest it's own food. Instead, it anchors itself to the inner wall of the bird's intestines, letting its segmented body dangle in the flow of digested material, absorbing nutrients before they can be utilized by the host. A variety of commercially available anthelmintics will effectively and safely eliminate both nematodes and cestodes from poultry.DiseasesFowl PoxFowl pox is a viral disease of chickens characterized by scab-like lesions on the skin of the unfeathered body parts and/or on diphtheritic (wet) membranes lining the mouth or air passages. Infection with the fowl pox virus will cause the chickens to have poor growth, poor feed conversion and a precipitous fall in egg production. Fowl pox may affect any age bird. It is transmitted by direct contact with an infected chicken or by mosquitos.Table 2.For more information on fowl pox, refer to publication VM66, \"Prevention and Control of Fowl Pox in Backyard Chicken Flocks\".CoccidiosisCoccidiosis is a protozoan disease characterized by enteritis and diarrhea in poultry. Unlike the organisms which cause many other poultry diseases, coccidia are almost universally found wherever chickens are raised. Coccidiosis outbreaks vary from very mild to severe infections.SeeTable 2. Individual strains of cocci attack birds differently, resulting in diverse symptoms. The overall symptoms may be one or more of the following: bloody droppings, high mortality, general droopiness,emaciation, a marked drop in feed consumption, diarrhea and a drop in egg production in layers.It is common to add a coccidiostate in the feed of broilers. In addition, live vaccines are currently available.Infectious bronchitisInfectious bronchitis is a highly contagious respiratory disease. The disease is caused by a virus which is moderately resistant, but can be destroyed by many common disinfectants. Infectious bronchitis occurs only in chickens (Infectious bronchitis is different from Quailbronchitis which affects Bobwhite Quail). All ages of chickens are susceptible to infectious bronchitis. In laying hens it is characterized by respiratory signs (gasping, sneezing, coughing)and a marked decrease in egg production. Egg quality is also adversely affected. Low egg quality and shell irregularities (soft-shelled or mis-shapened) may persist long after an outbreak.Chickens that have had infectious bronchitis, especially during the first week of life, may never be good layers.There is no effective treatment for infectious bronchitis, although broad spectrum antibioticsfor 3 to 5 days may aid in controlling secondary bacterial infections. Vaccines can be used for prevention, but they are only effective if they contain the right serotypes of virus fora given area. Infectious bronchitis vaccine is often combined with Newcastle vaccine in the same vial.Newcastle diseaseNewcastle disease is caused by a virus. The viruses vary in pathogenicity and are classified as lentogenic (mildly virulent), mesogenic (moderately virulent), and velogenic (markedly virulent). Newcastle disease is characterized by a sudden onset and rapid spread through the flock. In adult laying hens clinical signs can include depression, loss of appetite, decreased water consumption, and a dramatic decline in egg production. Production may drop to zero. Newcastle disease runs its course in 10 to 14 days, but the hens do not come back into full production for 5 to 6 weeks.There is no treatment for Newcastle disease. Antibiotics can be given for 3 to 5 days to prevents secondary bacterial infections. Chickens and turkeys can be immunized against Newcastle disease by vaccination.Avian influenzaAvian influenza is a viral disease affecting the respiratory, digestive and/or nervous systems of many species of birds. Avian influenza viruses are classified based on severity of disease,ranging from apathogenic to highly pathogenic. The mildly pathogenic form produces listlessness,respiratory signs (sneezing, coughing), and diarrhea. The level of mortality is usually low. The highly pathogenic form of avian influenza produces facial swelling, cyanosis, and dehydration with respiratory distress. Dark red/white spots (cyanosis/ischemia) develop on the legs and combs of chicks. Mortality can range from low to near 100%. The decrease in egg production is related to the severity of the disease and can be severe.There is no specific treatment for avian influenza. Recovery is rather spontaneous. Birds slaughtered 7 days after infection often have no significant increase in condemnations.Infected flocks will be quarantined by the State. Quarantine is continued until the flock is depopulated. The course of the disease is 10 to 14 days, but recovered birds continue to shed the avian influenza virus in feces for 3 or 4 weeks. Eggs from layers are safe to eat,but the shell should be wash and sanitized. The poultry litter or manure should be composted before application to cultivated lands.For more information on avian influenza refer to publication PS-38, \"Avian Influenza in Poultry\".Avian encephalomyelitisAvian encephalomyelitis (epidemic tremors) is a viral disease usually affecting young poultry. It is characterized by incoordination and tremors, especially of the head and neck in chicks,and elevated mortality levels. Chicks that recover may later develop cataracts after sexual maturity. In affected hens, decreases in egg production and hatchability are noted.Laying hens seldom show clinical signs when infection is going through the flock. However,good production records often reveal a slight drop in egg production (5 to 20%) lasting no more than two weeks. In breeding flocks, a corresponding decrease in hatchability is also noted. There is no effective treatment. All replacement breeder and layer pullets should be immunized.Mycoplasma gallisepticum infectionMycoplasma gallisepticum infection (chronic respiratory disease, PPLO infection, airsacculitis, MG) is characterized by respiratory distress (coughing, sneezing, snicks, rales, discharge from eyes and nose).Feed consumption and egg production decline in laying hens. Mortality is usually low but there may be many unthrifty birds.The organism may be present in a flock and cause no disease until triggered by stress, e.g.,changes in housing, management, nutrition, or weather.Many broad spectrum antibiotics have been used for treatment and will suppress losses. However,relapses often occur when treatment is discontinued. Most antibiotics are given in feed or water, preferably in water. Tylosine and tetracyclines have been used extensively for treatment. Injectable antibiotics may be more effective if the disease is advanced and if the flock is small enough to be treated individually. FDA withdrawal periods for respective medications used must be strictly observed to avoid residual chemicals in the eggs and meat. Live and inactivated vaccines also are commonly used to reduce the adverse effects of the disease.Fowl choleraFowl cholera is an infectious bacterial disease of poultry. With an acute outbreak, sudden unexpected deaths occur in the flock. Laying hens may be found dead on the nest. Sick birds show anorexia, depression, cyanosis, rales, discharge from eyes and nose, white watery or green mucoid diarrhea, and egg production is decreased.As fowl cholera becomes chronic, chickens develop abscessed wattles and swelling of joints and foot pads. Cheesy pus may accumulate in the sinuses under the eyes. Flocks can be treated with a sulfa drug. Sulfa drugs are not FDA approved for use in pullets older than 14 weeks or for commercial laying hens. Sulfa drugs cause residues in meat and eggs. Prolonged use of sulfa drugs is toxic and causes a decrease in production in laying hens. Antibiotics can be used, but require higher levels and longer medication to stop the outbreak. Where fowl cholera is endemic, live and/or inactivated vaccines are recommended. Do not start vaccinating for fowl cholera until it becomes a problem on the farm and a diagnosis is confirmed.Infectious coryzaCoryza is a respiratory disease of chickens. Common clinical signs include swelling and puffiness around the face and wattles, a thick sticky discharge with a characteristic offensive odor from the nostrils, labored breathing, and rales. There is a drop in feed and water consumption as well as egg production. Sulfadimethoxine (Albon) is the preferred treatment for infectious coryza. If Albon failsor is not available, sulfamethazine, sulfamerazine, or erythromycin (Gallimycin) can be used as alternative treatments. The sulfa drugs are not FDA approved for pullets older than 14weeks or for commercial laying hens.A vaccine for infectious coryza is available. It is given subcutaneously (under the skin)on the back of the neck. Chicks are usually vaccinated four times, starting at 5 weeks of age (i.e., at 5, 9, 15, and 19 weeks with at least 4 weeks between injections). Vaccinate again at 10 months of age and twice yearly thereafter.Other Problems To ConsiderThere are a variety of other problems which can cause an apparent drop in egg production.They include:Predators and snakes consuming the eggs.Egg-eating by hens in the flock.Excessive egg breakage.Hens which are able to run free hiding the eggs instead of laying in nests.SummaryThere are numerous factors which may adversely affect egg production in backyard chicken flocks. If a drop in egg production occurs, investigate the cause by answering questions that follow also refer toTable 1 andTable 2, sick and recently dead birds to a state diagnostic lab, and/or consult with your County Extension Agent or a veterinarian.How old are the birds?How much feed are the birds consuming daily?Has the level of feed consumption changed lately?Has there been a change in the type of feed used?Is the feed moldy?How much light do the birds receive daily? Has it changed?What is the light source?What is the condition of the poultry houses?Are the birds getting enough clean water?What is the condition of the birds?How active are the birds?What is shell quality like?What is interior egg quality like?Are there any signs of disease?Are the birds crowded?Are there any signs of parasites?Do the birds have access to different plants?Have any pesticides or herbicides been used in the area?State Diagnostic Laboratories:1) Live Oak Diagnostic LabPO Box Drawer O912 Nobels Ferry RdLive Oak, FL 32060tel: 904/362-12162) Kissimmee Diagnostic LabPO Box 460Kissimmee, FL 32641tel: 407/846-5200TablesTable 1. Table 1. Non-infectious causes of reduced egg production.CAUSES OF DECLINESIGNS/SYMPTOMSOMISSION OF INGREDIENTSSaltNervous flock, increased pecking, feathers in digestive tractCalciumBirds down in cages, increased incidence of shell-less eggsVitamin D3Increased mortality from calcium depletion, increased shell-less eggsProteinIncreased nervousness, increased mortality (peckouts), poor albumen quality, feather eatingFatLow body weight gains, drop in egg sizeTOXICOSESSaltIncreased mortality due to urolithiasis, lowered feed intakePhosphorusLower feed intake, soft bones, thin shells, increased shell-less eggsVitamin D3Increased shell-less eggs, soft bonesMycotoxinsNervousness, mouth lesions, fatty livers, biliary hyperplasia in liver tissue, reduced feed intake, thin shellBotulismWeakness, limp neck, neck feathers easy to pull out, prostrationANTICOCCIDIALSNicarbazinShell-less eggs, loss of pigment of brown eggs, lowered hatch, of fertile eggsMonensinReduced feed consumption, birds lack coordinationMANAGEMENT MISTAKESOut of feedNervous flock, decreased feed consumptionOut of waterBlue combs, birds gathered around waterersInadequate daylengthUnusual pattern of egg productionHigh ambient temperatureReduced egg size, reduced feed consumption, increased water consumption, pantingECTOPARASITESNorthern fowl miteNervousness, finding mites on birds (usually around the cloaca)LiceNervousness, weight loss, reduced feed intakeStick-tight fleasFleas embedded in the fleshy parts of the chickens's head around the eyes, ulceration and irritation of skin around the eyesENDOPARASITESNematodes (roundworms)Unthriftiness, poor feed efficiency, increased mortality (in severe infestations)Cestodes (tapeworms)General unthriftiness, dry and unkempt feathers, hearty appetite but weight lossTable 2. Table 2. Typical diagnostic signs associated with common diseases and conditions which can cause a drop in egg production.DISEASESIGNSFowl pox- scab-like lesions on the unfeathered body parts (especially face and comb)Coccidiosis- characteristic gross lesions in the intestinal tract - higher mortality in some cases - bloody droppingsInfectious bronchitis- coughing, sneezing, and rales - egg production drops markedly (by as much as 50%). - soft-shelled or misshapen eggs - watery egg white - poor pigmentation of brown-shelled eggsNewcastle diseaseMild form:Acute form: - reduction in feed and water consumption- respiratory distress - dramatic drop in egg production- twisted neck - decreased shell quality - increased mortalityAvian influenzaMildly pathogenic form:Highly pathogenic form: - listlessness- facial swelling - sneezing, coughing- dark red/white spots on legs and combs - diarrhea- respiratory distressAvian encephalomyelitis- seldom show clinical signs - slight, transient drop in egg productionMycoplasma gallisepticum- coughing, sneezing, snicks, rales, nasal and ocular discharge - decrease in feed consumption and egg productionFowl cholera- sudden unexpected deaths - reduction in feed consumption - swollen wattles - nasal and ocular discharge - cyanosis of head - white water or green mucoid diarrheaInfectious coryza- swelling and puffiness around the face and wattles - thick, foul-smelling nasal discharge - labored breathing - decrease in feed and water consumptionFootnotes1. This document is FACT SHEET PS-35, one of a series of the Animal Sciences Department, Florida Cooperative Extension Service, Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences, University of Florida.

{"title": "Nursing a Sick Chicken & A Tip For Keeping Them Healthy", "date": "Mar 10, 2013", "text": "Nursing a Sick Chicken in the Chicken Hospital-One of the things you learn raising a small flock, is that sometimes you see one sick chicken out of the group. Everyone else looks fine. Little Blackie started looking droopy Friday , so I kept an eye on her yesterday- droopy, staying off by herself, eating, but tail down. Not egg bound I found. I decided to worm the flock today, even though I use an all natural wormer year round Wormguard . I didn't want to risk losing anymore. I lost 2 girls, 6 weeks apart from worms 2 years ago. I figured out is was worms, after I lost them. They're pretty common in many flocks, especially if they share a yard with dogs, and in warmer weather. Last spring summer or so, I started the flock on the all natural stuff.Today I broke out the chicken hospital (above) and brought my sick girl in. I brought out the Wazine, my last resort wormer, since you can't eat the eggs for about 10 days after. It does work however. Then I got out the high calorie dog paste GNC High Calorie Booster, eye dropper and 2 laundry baskets. Baskets are great to use for sick chickens as they're easy to just throw an old towel in the bottom and can be disinfected after use easily. You can also diagnose better by looking at the stool on the towel. Worms are easy to spot if they big enough. She passed a big one about 1/2 hours after I dosed her up, yummy, ech. I read about using the high calorie paste for sick birds, and I think it makes a big difference in the hens bouncing back faster. You just put some on the tip of your finger, reach above their head and squeeze their jaws open gently, then rub it into their months. They swallow it right down! Wait a bit and repeat. I also gave her some wormer out of a dropper. Another tip I learned is- drop the liquid on the top of the beak, below the nostril, and they will drink it up. She did! I have done this with another bird, Ellie, very successfully.So Little Blackie is the the room with a view, nice dry towel, so rolled oats, water and a little leftover cooked fish. She'll go back in the coop this evening, and I'll see how she looks tomorrow. The nice thing about this \"system\", is that it's easy to repeat. It gives the hen a rest, extra nutrients, and quiet.                                                   A Tip For Keeping Them  Healthy-I noticed lately that Rosie's feather were really looking gorgeous! Really full, shiny and there's some teal now that I don't ever remember seeing. Her feathers had been a little rough looking and she hasn't laid in a year and a half. She's in retirement :) I think that adding the natural wormer AND the Bragg's Organic Raw Apple Cider Vinegar to their water has really helped. I had read that the vinegar helps cut down on swollen crops and is really good for the hard shells. It's unfiltered and great on salads too! There's lots of interesting ideas of easy flock management on Backyardchickens.comSigns of spring! Finally!!!"},
{"title": "Scoring Materials for Coop, Cheap French Chic!", "date": "Mar 9, 2013", "text": "Soon to raise the roof!Scoring Materials For Coop-We needed quite a bit ofmaterials to re-build/expand our urban coop. Hubby had a \"feeling\" heshould go the Habitat for Humanity store last night. He scored a huge amount ofmaterials cheap, for a good cause, and recycled. We went to another recycledbuilding materials store this morning, ditto. I found a gorgeous door that was$100.00, marked down to $10.00. Score! I'll post pictures as the building moves along. We plan on doing it, hopefully, on spring break, the end of this month (weather permitting). We're going to build sections in the yard. On the second day- do the tear down and put it all together. Dave's good at designing and building, and I add other basic ideas for layout and decor. We want to recycle whatever we can from the first coop, and mostly \"raise the roof\". It will have a full size door, we'll be able to walk in to clean, and a solid roof for more weather hardiness. The current wavy plastic roofing would collapse under any big tree branches, etc. We'll have the nest box on the front, and the full size door (see photo below) where the nesting box is. Dave found a nice, big window too. After a huge windstorm almost took out the coop 2 years ago, we agreed it was better to build, a solid, shingled roof. It will have more roosting areas, and be easier to clean, bright and good ventilation. I think the girls will LOVE it! I'll paint it the same color so it will blend in.Cheap French Chic-After looking at my work clothes, and deciding a needed to tweak things a little, I stood there scratching my not knowing exactly what to actually DO! Hmmm, time to go to the library. I remembered that French women (even the older ones like me) are known for having some style. While I don't mind using a lot of thrifted clothes for work, I knew I needed to get some specific NEW things. So here's the big reveal! It's fun for me, and it's not homesteading, but hey I gotta work to build the coop ya know? :) I got everything at either discount stores or deeply on sale online. I also got 2 new pairs of slacks I didn't take pics of- basic, well cut- smoke gray, and a dark green/gray. I just need to find a navy pair now.Classic navy 3/4 length sleeve cardigan- TJ MaxxClassic white, wrinkle-resistant blouse TJ Maxx. I got an identical one in light blueOld Navy lightweight cotton sweater, so soft! I did pay full price for this because I LOVED it!LL Bean, last summers model. I've had these before- and nice & cool for the spring/summerOld Navy polka dot blouse, love it! $5.99 I think Keen sneakers, a little cleaning in order I see.  Easy to clean the rubber, just a soapy sponge. Much cheaper than Converse and better support. I've had so many compliments on these at work! These were 1/2 priceCute soleNew summer tote at Goodwill, made of recycled plastic- $1.50I also got a purse on eBay coming. Leather, Fossil brand, casual but a little dressier. I came to realize a long time ago- it's either leather or fabric for me. Faux leather just doesn't hold up."},

We had company and we all loved them!  Nice & Clean CoopCoop Cleaning & Re-Do-When I first read about the Deep Litter Method it sounded to good to be true. Then I tried it. Talk about easy, clean, healthy and simple! So today we cleaned out the upper condo and nesting boxes, and top dressed the sun room and lower coop. On spring break we'll do the lower area. The girls love the fresh bedding, and the old goes to the garden where it breaks down easily and quickly. Really helps the soil quality in this hot, dry climate in the summer. We're probably going to raise the roof of the coop soon, add a full size door and move the windows. It's too hard to clean and service without being on your hands and knees.before shot, dirty litter removedDirty litter spread in gardenRosie ApprovesGirls enjoying the warm afternoon outside, while the coop was cleanedRosieMollyMeal worm treats!

It was nice and warm and breezy. It's a gorgeous Spanish mission-style depot, sadly no trains come here anymore. It's used for weddings and tours. I would love to take a train to Portland. I keep hoping they'll come back, sigh. I love riding on trains! Go up on the upper deck and watch the terrain go by. Someday I'd like to go all the way across Canada, to Nova Scotia.

{"title": "How To Save BIG $ On A New Camera- Family Swap", "date": "Feb 23, 2013", "text": "How To Save BIG $ On A New Camera: Do a Family Swap!-My one daughter with a bachelor' degree in Fine Art/Photography recently got a new job at a local, high end camera store. Oh boy, it was time for her to buy a new camera she had waited for! Since she had lots of lenses she bought a DSLR camera body online. Much cheaper and it worked well for her. She was going to sell her higher end Canon DSLR, but Dave and I made her an offer. It was a win-win since she owed us some $$$ for a college loan. So, Dave got her \"old\" camera, better than what he had, and he went out and bought a macro and telephoto lens (great deal). He can do more things now with his photography blog, and saved a bundle! Then- I got Dave's old Olympus DSLR camera. What fun, more things I can do! From a voluntary simplicity angle it really works too- something that can be reused, taken care of and appreciated. I went from this small Olympus, pretty limited use, point-and-shoot 6 - 63 mm - to this big boy: 14 - 42 mm and a telephoto with a 40-150 mm!  Luckily I had taken photography classes way back in my 20's, so some of this is coming back. It's great to have much more flexibility in shooting. I really love photography, since I've always been a visual person. The only downsize, for me, is there's no macro lens available. Farther down the line we might get another Canon body and share lenses, a good way to save more $. We're all happy! Here's to family swapping!Here's some test pictures I took today, after a sleet/snow storm blew thru early this morning, lots of blue sky!Mom- where's the snacks?Girls enjoying the sun, this was shot from our deck, the telephoto really made a big differenceLove the blue sky, windy and coldRoad trip to Idaho City for Dave's birthday lunch last weekend-I love the cute, old gingerbread on the buildingLooking west from Idaho City, an old silver mining town"},
{"title": "The \"Ikea Effect\", What To Eat Sheets, What's With The Weather?", "date": "Feb 18, 2013", "text": "My Ikea Effect GirlsThe \"Ikea Effect-This morning I read Terry's post- The Ikea Effect, over at her blog. Excellent post! Interesting ideas and not a big surprise to me. It's the basic idea that when you invest some time and labor into something, it's of more value to you than something you didn't invest that in. Like setting up an Ikea furniture item. You could just buy something and bring it home, OR you could put it together yourself! \"Hey, look what I did!\" I found the original article Terry linked Ikea Effect-When Labor Leads to Love fascinating. It stated the idea that  adding an egg to a cake mix made it more \"homemade\". The buyers rejected the original cake mixes where you just added water as too \"easy\". Nothing invested. Bad Mommy. I thought of my little urban homestead and how much more I value what I grow and harvest than anything I could ever buy. That's MY blood, sweat and tears out there pal. The manure I dig in, my chickens I help keep safe, happy and healthy, the fruit trees I buy and we plant. All the blisters, sunburn, aches and pains. All those things are a PROCESS, it never ends. Trees die, get it removed, plant a new one. Needs change, adapt and thrive, or die (metaphorically speaking). It's easy to think \"we're done\" sometimes in life, but it really never does end. Or, you can choose that. We start off with little things, cultivate them, learn and try more. When I became a Master Gardner thru the University of Idaho extension years ago I never dreamed I'd be where I am now- growing more and more food each year, keeping chickens, canning, drying, and pantrying (is that a word?). You never know where your love of something will take you. I love nature so much, of course I'd  wind up being a Master Gardener. A homesteader on a little city lot? I never thought of it as an \"official\" urban homesteading thing until years later. Sometimes you just do things and later find out it's a trend :)  Hmmm...                          What To Eat Sheets-I found this great little pads of sheets at Cost Plus, $6.00. Cute idea- a list for each day, where you'll eat, what to plan for each meal and/or snacks. Kind of a fun tool I'll try. When you work full time, it's easy to come home tired and go out too much, or not make something from scratch, FAST, because you planned ahead. I made some baking mix the other day, to keep on hand for biscuits, for instance. I can have them in the oven in under 10 minutes! Hot and fresh, and I added whole grain to the mix for a healthier mix.Girls getting out of the cold wind into their sun roomWhat's With The Weather?-The last couple of days were like spring! In the mid 50's, holy moly! I washed my rear windows, cleaned up the garage a bit, and today I went and vacuumed out my car and cleaned it up. It's forecast for snow off and on the next week- high's in the 30's/lows 20's. Just pick a season already!!! It's really blowing now and you can feel the temp drop. We still have a little snow in the shadows by the back fence, but the chickens have LOVED being outside, digging in the dirt again.

Working means I use the food and then replace it, on a fairly regular basis. With limited kitchencabinets it was a logical idea. It's much more of a process than I thought it would be, however.Turning a spare bedroom closet into a closet full of shelving was theeasy part. Dave about had a coronary when I started buying quite a bit of extra food to get the pantry going. Then it's a matter of figuring out - *what to buy*how much to buy*will you actuallyeat it?*emergency onlyfoods/drinks- what to buy?*misc.- all thestuff you'll think of later, like paper plates for emergency use.*storing freebies?Freezing & other food storage ideas: I will add, buyinga medium-sized chest freezer was also a great idea! We did that last spring, when we bought a freezer after doing a bit of research. We got ours at Costco. I have REALLYsaved a lot of money by buying things in season and freezing for later- peppers,berries, etc. Things when they are cheap- chicken in the summer for barbecuing,bulk bacon, anything on sale. I learned to double bag the meats, squeeze out the excess air. I used some chicken from last summer this week, and it was perfect! No freezer burn.You can also store other things without freezing. I also stock up onvacuum-packaged like broths, soups and items like this-                                           Here's my recently reorganized pantry closet-I try to keep things together in sections- veggies, fruits, juices, baking supplies,proteins, grains, sugarsI try to have a good mix of dried beans, but also some canned for work nights.I also store my big kitchen items, like the huge mixing bowl (for canning) and small appliances I don't use that much.

{"title": "Frigid Inversion & Freezing Rain, Independence Days Challenge", "date": "Jan 24, 2013", "text": "What an inversion looks likeFrigid Inversion & Freezing Rain-We have been having the most god-awful weather here the last couple of weeks. With a smoggy inversion laying over the city (up to 700') the air quality sucks! Terrible for folks with breathing problems, colds, etc. It also keeps the temps way down: -1 yesterday morning, again. We had freezing rain last night, horrible roads and the local school district (mine) had the wisdom to make us go to work. Accidents everywhere, people getting hurt, the highway and airport closed. They sort of apologized on the noon news- \"Gee, we didn't think it was that BAD at 5 a.m.\" Gee, it was bad two weeks ago at 6:45 a.m. when I got the \"snow day\" call. It's just not worth folks getting injured before they even make it into the building, or in a wreck. Many smart parents kept their kids home. There were a lot of ANGRY employees today. Ah well, we'll see what tomorrow brings... hopefully I'll be home. It's 31, with a low forecast in the teens again tonite. Luckily the inversion is supposed to get blown out by the next storm this weekend. Maybe more snow next week... Independence Days Challenge-I haven't done one of these for a while, so here goes!1. Plant Something- Nothing til spring.2. Harvest Something- The girls are doing well with their egg production, I think the extra light this winter really helped. 2-3 per day.3. Preserve/Store Something- Will be pickling hard boiled eggs this weekend, way too many eggs! I have 2+ dozen in the fridge, will make a fritatta this weekend.4. Manage Reserves- Get A Good Deal/Barter/Stock Up/Prep- Found some good deals at the grocery outlet, found a couple of 1/2 off winter sweaters locally. A lot of the big names like LL Bean have their winter stuff marked down and free shipping. Their stuff lasts forever! I've worn their women's flannel shirts all winter and they're lasted for 6-7 years. Well made! We got a good rebate on our new Norton software, as our old was expiring. A little free fruit from work, and veggies for the girls. Got more Romano cheese at Costco, what a deal! Keeping the pantry stocked. I look back at how much I have used my old winter snow clogs, winter snow boots, heavy coats, mittens, etc. Many of these things  I have had for 12+ years, it really pays to spend a little extra, or buy off-season. It's good to have all those things on hand. The thin wool socks I got at Costco too are incredibly warm! What a deal- 3 for $9.99! Now we just need a wood stove. I love the idea of having some extra heating source here.5. Eat the Food- Try New Foods/Recipes- We'll be eating eggs this week! Made some beer bread, and wonderful soup out of misc. veggies, & beans on hand. Working on the pantry foods. I bought some whole grain English muffins. I hadn't had those in years, yummy, with homemade jam!!!6. Build Community Food Systems- Not selling eggs right now, but probably next month. Helps with the feed bill.7. Recycle/Re-Use- I took in the waist of some slacks that were falling down, a little darting was all they needed! Fitting perfect now. Still giving scraps to the girls. We'll be adding more pine shavings this weekend, then the used go out in the garden. We don't compost in the pile this time of year, too cold.8. Skill Up- Did some sewing, had to remember how to do darts. 9. Regenerate What is Lost/Salvage Something- Dave is bringing home some scrap PVC pipe to cover the cold frame soon. That should speed up the growing season.Now I'm just ready for some BLUE SKY!"},

I never ate lamb until a few years ago. Once I tried a lamb sandwich made with local grass fed meat, I was hooked! I ate it at Bar Gernika, featured on Diners, Drive Ins and Dives.  Lamb is (to me) still very expensive. I finally decided to try some ground lamb. I was going to do a Greek lamb burger, but didn't have a few ingredients on hand. So I did this Classic Shepherd's Pie instead. I subbed chicken stock for beef, and used frozen peas and carrots. Since I added extra veggies I used an oval casserole, since I didn't want dinner all over the bottom on the oven. Here's the picture coming out-Dark Chocolate Oatmeal Cookies-I love these in the winter, they're great with a cup of something hot. A real adult cookie with the steel cut oats! The recipe is here: Dark Chocolate Oatmeal Cookies  Do yourself a favor- do NOT sub rolled oats for this. The steel cut oats really make the cookie!!! I always make a double batch since it a small one."},
{"title": "And Now For Something French! ", "date": "Jan 20, 2013", "text": "And Now For Something French!-Recently I realized my wardrobe was getting pretty boring, even for me! While I'm very practical, I like to keep a bit updated with my work clothes, so I don't look like I'm dressing 15 years older than I actually am (56). People tell me I look younger than I am, so I started thinking about my clothes. Not to be superficial, but if I'm that bored with my clothes, well what the heck! I understand this isn't my usual type of blogging, but hey, read on if you're interested! Needless to say, I'll be changing some things on a budget, and being thrifty!We all fall into habits, sometimes bad ones. I've always been a casual dresser, but when I realized a lot of my jeans don't really fit me right, I said \"well, fix it\". Mind you that doesn't mean going out and buying a bunch of clothes but- what would fit better? I recently realized a lot of my thrift (and new) slacks/jeans really aren't the right cut for me. The butt hangs down in many of my jeans! Geez, I lost a bunch of weight, I don't need sagging jeans!!! A couple of days ago I tried on a petite pair of jeans that fit me perfectly, and looked much thinner. I saw that the waist was more curved and was where it should be. AH HA!  Then I ran across a fun little book at my library- Parisian Chic                                             A lot of the basics in the book were already things I do- try to buy (but not always) good quality clothes/shoes, that fit your body right, don't get into fads. Of course the French model in the book is very thin and 20, maybe. I think it's much better to do what smarter women than I do- have a smaller wardrobe, but with good quality (LL Bean, Carhartt's or whatever) and classics. Rather than having a bunch of junk clothing/shoes you never wear, cut it down. A bunch of clothing you never wear- guilty here! Anyway, I also read some articles online about what older French women wear! Here's some photos that I loved-Actress Rachel Ward in ParisI love her glasses, short hair and casual thrown together look, probably very well-planned :)Very cute gray hair, scarf, beads and shades!I think some flats (usually wear Danskos) might be a good choice for my feet at work. Not what I would usually consider. Not BORING!So, I also found some fun French burlapey pillows, all the rage, when Dave and I went out pre-shopping for a new couch (ours is falling apart). I was using burlap 10+ years ago for table runners, etc., so I find it pretty funny it's so \"hip\" now. I saw these cute pillows in the store. Sorry for the color, my cell phone adjustments were off. They were cream/tan with rust red-Today at Ross I picked this up for next Christmas, too cute for $3.00!I am not young but I feel young. The day I feel old, I will go to bed and stay there. J'aime la vie! I feel that to live is a wonderful thing.Coco Chanel"},

Poor sinus skin. The chickens have on their reptile heater disc in their upper condo, lots of extra treats, and water. They're not coming out much, but I can't blame them. I know they'll love it when everything warms up and melts. They're laying pretty well with the extra light on. I've been living in polar fleece, wool sweaters, ski mittens, fleece scarves, heavy coat, thick socks and snow clogs. Thick, icky, crusty ice all over parking lots, etc. make it slippery going in and out. Glad I have invested in good winter footwear! Good old prepping.

{"title": "Lessons Learned On the Front Lines of Frugality, Salmon Pie", "date": "Jan 5, 2013", "text": "Lessons Learned On the Front Lines of Frugality-Today I was reading blogs about saving money with the 2% pay cut. What a brouhaha. That will hit Dave and I too. Am I worried? No. Adjust and review, that's me. I came to being frugal from a different angle than some- voluntary simplicity. Being raised \"poor\" I always knew what it was like to go without. My divorced, single Mom couldn't manage money. That certainly didn't help. Anyway, when the Voluntary Simplicity movement was just getting started in the N.W. I started reading about it. The idea of living more lightly on the planet, saving resources, AND money appealed to me. It taught me to look at what's important and be more sensitive about what I really NEEDED. Being more thoughtful, living a more examined life.                            Not being what is viewed as a typical, materialistic American (I don't know where I fall in that range) I embraced those ideas. I continued on that path when I became a parent, thrifting a lot for most things but not skimping on others, like dental care! Dave and were both in that same kind of thought process- choose what you need to do. I never bought my kids used shoes for instance, they'd wear them out, and I wanted them to have good feet. So, after careful consideration of the above facts, here's some things I've found that work, in case you want to save some time, the Earth and some moola!*Define what's important to you- people or stuff? My relationships always come first.                             *I don't do coupons. To me it's a waste of time, gas, andmoney. Most of them IMO tend to be for junk foods. I can get better deals ondry goods by knowing my stores. *If you're lucky enough to be to staying home full time, youcan starting to bake from scratch- breads, rolls, cakes, etc. It's muchcheaper, and healthier, than boxed mixes.*I make a lot of dinner dishes with my eggs- quiches,fritattas, etc. They're much cheaper than meat, and I know what is in my eggs!Protein is protein. If your hubby gripes about no meat, have him check thegrocery bill :)  Or get a 2nd job tosupport his meat addiction! Ha!*Try new recipes and foods. See salmon pie below. Thinkoutside the box.*Talk to your doctors and health care providers! Theyusually don't think thrift here. Always ask for generics and ask if you REALLYneed those meds? What about something else? Those folks don't track on thosekinds of things. Do you need BOTH those meds? I saved a bunch of money on myasthma meds by changing prescriptions, with my Docs input. It worked BETTER andwas cheaper. Same thing with my heart meds- the new, best thing washorrendously expensive, didn't work well. The old generic worked BETTER was is$10.00 a month :)  Ask, ask, ask.*Use supplements. If you can preserve your long-term health,you will be healthier, live longer and have a better quality of life. Do yourresearch. I use 2000 IUs of vitamin D daily, and have had one cold in 3 years,and NO bronchitis. I used to get that every winter. Having asthma made thatvery horrendous. No more!*Buy good quality whatever. I don't buy cheap chocolate,because I wouldn't enjoy it. Ditto Dave's coffee beans. Buy better, but less.You save $$$ in the long run.*Going to buy a new toy, tech gizmo, or mini-vacation? Spendthat $$$ on something else that will pay for itself. Buy a bread machine, bookson making things- soaps, lotions, shampoos. Start planting more food in yourcity front and back yards, expand your gardens. If you're lucky enough to livein a mild climate, you can grow almost year-round!  It's 9 degrees right now in Boise! Thinkabout what you're really buying.*We cut our cell phone bills down by a huge amount as the thenkids started paying their portions on our plan. All of our full time collegekids had part time jobs. Now two are on their own plans, the last one is comingoff this month. Woo hoo! We also always get the \"freephones\". Why spend extra $$$ on something like that? We have 2 computersat home, and at work. Spend it on something else.*We sold off a lot excess stuff we didn't need onCraigslist- biking gear, furniture, a TV, misc. stuff and made $100.00s ofdollars! Easy and fast! Yard sales are good for collectibles, but big items aregreat on CL.***HERE'S A BIG ONE- Plan ahead for big purchases, but be FLEXIBLE. If you run into an excellent deal, do it! We had planned on waiting til spring for a flat screen TV. Dave found a floor model on sale at Big Lots, with an extra 30% off that one day. He called me, I measured, and viola! We saved a huge amount, and love the new TV. Things change day to day, and you never know what you'll find.                                                  *This book really changed how I look at having a working pantry and saving money of foods, etc. I saved a hugeamount of $ by not wasting food or buying what we really didn't like or use. Iwas gifted with a free online class Sharon did last spring and learned a LOT! Independence Days- A Guide To Sustainable Food Storage & Preservation*Hack out some space for apantry or extra food storage. Move stuff into your garage and use a linencloset, store under beds, buy a bookcase and cover it with fabric, whatever.Don't put it off, do it now.*Need hot water? We drink alot of teas, and french press coffee. This uses a lot less electricity, and isfaster. It's an electric teakettle (Target). They are great in hot weather too,not heating up the kitchen.*Heat where you need it. We have a good central heat system, but the kitchen tends to cooler (unless I'm baking), as we go out the back door a lot. I realized (duh) I was turning up the furnace to heat a small space. I dragged out our spare electric heater, put it under the computer desk- problem solved. Warm feet, less $$$!*Use passive cooling. While we have AC we also added lots of ceiling fans, upgraded our attic exhaust fans and vents, planted trees, and bought insulated drapes. When it's 100 degrees out for long periods, it all helps.*Choose your pets wisely. After losing 3 elderly pet over 3 years we decided to adopt a cat. Anya is very low maintenance pet compared to our 2 dogs. She does well if we leave for a day or 2. And hey, she's small. That's good in a smaller house. And ALWAYS spay or neuter!!!*Choose your homesteading animals wisely too. I'm urban, obviously, so that's my area of experience. I read some pretty interesting posts form rural folks, and the drama of owning bigger animals. My 4 hens work great in this space. If I do move more rural someday, I wold limit myself to 2 goats, and maybe some ducks. The fantasy of owning a horse is dead. DOA. High costs, a lot of labor, and vet bills. Riding lessons, you bet!Salmon Pie-This is so GOOD! I saw a cooking show on Sweden a while back and I saw a fish pie. I googled this, which was about identical-Finnish Simple Salmon Pie Recipe  I always buy pink, wild salmon on sale every year. The chickens loved the bones and skin (very little). Anya loved the salmon juice :)I doubled the recipe (except the milk, used 1 1/2 cups), added 1 teaspoon dried dill, 1 1/2 cups frozen peas, and used pie crust. I left the salmon in chunks and just laid it in the baking dish. It was a keeper!"},
{"title": "Little Homestead Year In Review ", "date": "Jan 2, 2013", "text": "Little Homestead Year In Review-With 2012 now behind us, I wanted to look at what we accomplished this last year towards being more self-sufficient. While I've felt in the past these goals were more personal for me, Dave has really come on board. He's always been a DIYer and gardener, so it wasn't a big stretch for him. I mostly had to learn to re-think things more thoroughly. So here's my list, mostly the BIG things, with a lot I'm sure I've forgotten-I got a lot more serious about canning, & food preservation. I started a \"working pantry\" out of a spare bedroom closet-We also bought a small chest freezer, and I transformed an old dresser into a canning cabinet, which was pretty full by summer's end-I bought, and grew, a lot more fresh produce to preserve, bought less store-canned and frozen                     also got some freebies from the neighbors!Did a LOT more thrifting, finding lots of clothes for work, things for the house/garden, and made more things myself-I helped Dave build this from an old screen I bought and cedar boardsStarted using more space in the yard for food production- planted a new pear tree and started a raised bed where a stump used to be. It was very productive! Sadly got 0 fruit from the apple and nectarine trees, due to the ba*****s from the city spraying herbicide near our easement. Luckily I saved our trees :)  I edited the veggie garden and planted only varieties that would thrive really well-Added 3 new girls to the family- my New Hampshires: Molly and Little Blackie. We harvested even more eggs once my new girls got into production this falland Anya, our little feline sweetheartWe took a few short road trips that I really enjoyed, and went camping-Ponderosa Lake, McCall, IdahoSt. Gertrude Monastery, northern IdahoGot a lot more organized in general- recipes and cookbooks \"before\"After-Started the Independence Days Challenge which really helped me organize my thoughts, goals and document what I actually did more-1.

Recycle/Re-Use- 8. Skill Up- 9. Regenerate What isLost/Salvage Something-                                         Started my First Annual Dark Days Challenge!Survived the worst fire season in the 15+ years we've lived here, horrible smoke for most of the summerGot rid of more \"stuff\"- sold a TV, cabinet, misc. stuff around the house on Craigslist and eBay, and donated the rest. We have so much more room in the garage, and house, for needed things. Also made some cash! The space looks more open and there's less stuff to maintain as well. I hate the cluttered, over-decorated look.Here's some hopes for this year-We ripped out an icky, old viney shrub in the front yard to replace with something that looks nicer and has some flowers. We may re-landscape some of the front yard to increase flower bed sizes and possibly add more food production there too. Except for the fruit trees, and a few berries, the front yard is mostly perennials and flowers. Keep the chickens happy and healthy. One is limping right now with no cause I can see, oh well. My chicken doctoring skills are much better now. Keep me healthier.Keep fixing up the house. We need to demo the old bathtub in our main bathroom, it's past it's usefulness.Add a small wood stove to the living room, since we always have some free wood and can find more :)                                                             Morso 2B Forest Stove                                                                                    Jotul Black BearI keep hoping to move out of the city at some point.

I don't do \"resolutions\", since I've found that doesn't work for me. I do look at what does/did work and keep my options open. To me it's a more positive tack. I found, for instance, getting focused on the BIG picture works better for me than sweating the minutiae of things. I can be be OCD, so I have to remind myself of that. I've looked at what I wanted to include in my life: like eating healthier, stressing less at work, letting go of some my kid's stupid (to me) decisions, appreciating my hubby more :) Worrying less about my various health issues- do more holistic stuff and get over it. I hear people who talk non-stop about how sick they are all the time. To me that just reinforces it, IMO. Reliving all your bad health issues is living in it, ALL THE TIME. I choose not to do that. I try to put my various health issues (I won't bore you with the details) into perspective- I have excellent insurance, live in a city with lots of resources, and have the income to buy supplements, etc. to keep myself band-aided together.

You adjust. After seeing local goose prices at $5.00 lb., with most of them 10 lbs. on up, I changed tactics. Time for duck! Smaller, but much more reasonable. Since it was just for the two of us, I knew one five-pounder would be fine. I found a nice recipe- Roast Duck With Plum Sauce. Since I had a big jar of plum \"butter\" (from Walmart's European food section) I used it instead of the whole plums. It was delicious! Meat was very tender, juicy and the sauce came out perfect-Stuffed with fresh oranges and onionI served it with plum sauce, mashed Yukon golds, and sauteed fresh spinach. I will do this again for sure! I remembered something about using duck grease, so I did a little research. It is used like butter for flavoring for roasting veggies, etc. It gives it a wonderful flavor. I strained mine after it cooled, and into the fridge it went. I read it's actually sold as a VERY expensive ingredient in French cooking. I guess it always pays to do your research! I have about 1/2 a cup. I'll report back how the flavor is....Wonderful Wordsworth Quote-I heard a quote tonight  in \"A River Runs Through It\" that I hadn't heard for years. It is part of a William Wordsworth poem called \"Intimations of Immortality from Recollections of Early Childhood\"-Of splendour in the grass, of glory in the flower; We will grieve not, rather find Strength in what remains behind; In the primal sympathy Which having been must ever be; In the soothing thoughts that spring Out of human suffering; In the faith that looks through deathThanks to the human heart by which we live, Thanks to its tenderness, its joys, and fears, To me the meanest flower that blows can give Thoughts that do often lie too deep for tears.Hoppin' John For New Years-I found a simple recipe for Hoppin' John, a traditional southern dish. With all the rich holiday foods, I wanted to do something simple and hearty. I didn't know it's traditionally served for New Years- Hoppin' John CustomsI used brown rice to serve with it, and followed this basic recipe-4 cups frozen black eyed peasenough water to cover16 ozs. chopped bacon2 large yellow onions1 tsp. chili powder2 tsp. thymesalt/pepper to taste2 bay leavesgreen onions for garnishPut all ingredients in a large pot, bring to a boil, then simmer for at least one hour. Stir once in a while, and add more water as needed. When nice and hot, remove bay leaf and serve over hot rice. Garnish with green onions. Next time I will try adding a little more heat and some tomatoes.Snow-We had a late white Christmas, with the snow starting about 8 p.m. or so. This morning the girls woke up to about an inch of white stuff, and wouldn't come out of the sun room-there was much discussion about what the heck it wasThey all stayed in until late afternoon, then came out and stretched their legs after it melted a bitThe New Chicken-Dave got me the cutest chicken wind chime for Christmas!!!I'll put it out tomorrow once the deck is saferAnya had to explore her new toy- a kitchen step ladder!"},

Now the temp is really dropping, with 30 degrees colder tonight in the forecast. We may get some snow down here (in the valley) for the next 3-5 days!!! Maybe a white Christmas! I love snow!!! Sigh, wish I lived in Minnesota or Wisconsin, near the north woods areas. I'd have to buy studded tires and a snow blower, but hey, I'd do it! I tell Dave if he goes first, I'm so outta here! I'd move either into the mountains nearby, or do a major re-location to somewhere greener, with trees and snow....                             New Blog I'm Following-The new blog I'm following is Lilfishstudios, what great art work she does!

Simplifying Christmas Gifting, Decorations, Your Dark Days Challenge?", "date": "Dec 21, 2012", "text": "Happy Solstice!Happy Solstice!-I go to a simple Winter Solstice event every year at the local Unitarian church that is very reflective about how this last year went, and the hopes for the next year. It's all done by candle light and so very peaceful. I think everyone should stop this time of year and look at their lives, instead of the mad dashing to buy stuff. So Happy Winter Solstice! We're still here!Simplifying Christmas Gifting-I've moved more and more into a voluntary simplicity mode in my life as I have gotten older, and wiser :)  I also have really gotten burned out on the crass commercialisation of Christmas. I used to work retail and I know what an illusion \"sales\" really are. I find it ironic that a supposedly Christian country focuses on shopping and not worship. Maybe I'm in the minority? I told all our adult girls that they would get home-made gifts and stocking stuffers this year, and that was it. They were fine with it. They are having their own tough times paying their student loans and being under-employed. My husband's family always did a gift exchange after the kids were 18, that way no one had to buy gifts for everyone, just one gift. Made sense to me! We're also trying to take the emphasis off gift giving and more spending time together. And it's pretty much cash only. While there's not as much under the tree, it so much more relaxing. I got things I know they'll really love, and it takes the pressure off.Decorations-I finally got everything out last weekend and put things up. The last thing was- fresh greens! We use a fake tree, but I always like some fresh pine greens in the house. I bought some at a local tree vendor. I scattered them thru the living room and dining room. Here's a few of may favorite decorations, with greens, as well as some of my ornaments. I made the little nest with the birds-Your Dark Days Challenge?Please feel free to post your recipes, and ideas here! I'll be doing another meal after next week.Snow's coming, yeah!!!"},

We both have some allergies, and it's more sustainable too, so why not? We got a nice big tree thrifting a couple of years ago, for $3.00, yes $3.00! It has 3 parts, goes together fast and it's re-useable. Stores in the garage in it's btree bag we got 2 weeks ago nicely. I bought some fresh piney greens this afternoon for that fresh smell. I like to stash those here and there around the house. I will, in fact, (don't tell the hubby) be making a roasted goose for Christmas. I made one years ago, and it's so easy! With all the goose grease involved, there's 0 basting, just roast it up!

She asked me to make Coq au Vin for dinner. It's basically chicken cooked in dark red wine and other yummies. Since I worked Friday I didn't do the overnight soak. I subbed with bacon, and dried herbs. We could find any fresh pearl onions at the store, so I used frozen with peas. The fresh mushrooms were wonderful. It came out spectacular!!! I used a 3 year- old bottle of a good Cabernet I had stashed. The meat fell off the bone, and just melted in your mouth. I served with crusty, hot french bread. Michelle's boyfriend raved about it :)  Meal well done. I'll take pictures of the next batch soon.Afternoon Snack-My fave tea, Darjeeling, with a touch of milk and sugar, and a biscotti. Nice afternoon snack on a cold, gray day. Darjeeling has a wonderful, slightly nutty flavor. An ex-employer (British) introduced me to it. Thanks Monica!Winter coop tonite, the snow just started!"},

Found some more jeans and cute greenery for the kitchen at the dollar store. Got a great deal on some work clogs at Clogoutlet. about 1/2 price.

I found a nice black suede pair of Sanitas. Happy feet!Girls Enjoying A Nice Break Between The Rain StormsIndependence Days-1. Plant Something-Nothing til spring. 2. Harvest Something-Orange rinds, dried them for baking coming up.  3. Preserve/StoreSomething- Froze some turkey stock for soup later. Made some more refrigerator pickles. 4. ManageReserves- Get A Good Deal/Barter/Stock Up/Prep- Got a free turkey from Dave's boss, using pantry a LOT! This part really does work! Bought extra veggies on sale, like celery before turkey day. 5. Eat the Food- TryNew Foods/Recipes- I can say I've really saved a LOT of money thisThanksgiving with having a well-stocked working pantry. I bought things earlyfor the snack spread I do, since we actually have a Thanksgiving\"dinner\". I had bought things like crackers, sausages, drinks,olives, etc. over the summer. I paid off having those more gourmet-type foodson hand bought on sale! I love it! Still finishing off the collard greens,turkey and working on the freezer foods. Just made a \"Lowlands Boil\"(spicy southern seafood stew) with my frozen seafood mix and fresh veggies. Chickens really loved the roasted , free pumpkins we got.6. Build CommunityFood Systems- Still selling eggs. Thinking about bartering off my IPod 8g, but not sure if I want to get rid of it. Got free pumpkins at a local market on turkey day.7. Recycle/Re-Use- Compost, lots of leaves! Lots of kitchen veggies going to the hens. 8. Skill Up- With a sick hen on my hands I learned how to do a simple antibiotic water mix pretty easily. I feel much more prepared now on how to handle these kinds of things quickly. No eggs for a while though. Learning the in and out of Win7 with the new computer. Outlook has more bells and whistles as well.9. Regenerate What isLost/Salvage Something-Me- Got a MRI for a sore, puffy knee. Some arthritis, nothing torn. Will work with exercising and more weight loss. I found some homeopathic stuff too for arthritis and the swelling, cheap! Just waiting for the MRI bill, and thankful I have good insurance!A simple cookie tin and tree branch, I want one!Winterizing The Home Decor-I always wait at least a week or so after turkey day to put away the fall stuff around the house. I then put up what I call my \"generic winter\" stuff. I don't like to jump from Thanksgiving to Christmas in one full swoop, I like to relax after a bit. I think I've gotten burned out too, with all the American commercialism around Christmas. I like some of the European traditions better, keeping it much more low-key and natural. I want to go to Scandinavia some day and see their version of Jul (Yule), it looks pretty awesome! I love the natural colors and materials-What a great entry or hallwayHow simple and elegantNot \"trolls\" but Tomten!This weekend I'm put away the Fall and bringing out the winter stuff.

Sometimes life just works out that way. Our really old XP CPU was on the way out. I knew that once Windows 8 came in full force, the old Windows 7 would be cheap, but would also disappear off the market. We could have bought and loaded Win 7, but our old computer was so old (even after adding more memory) that it wouldn't work. I shopped around online and in some stores, then found the HP above (on the link.) Since I could get Office Pro 2010 for $10.00 thru my employer ($400. retail!) we decided to but a new tower. I bought it online and it was delivered 4 days later. What a difference! It actually boots up and everything loads within a minute or 2! WOW!!! Doing happy dance. It didn't take too long to figure out Win7, I had backed up all my files, email address & favorites and they transferred pretty easily. We got an upgrade for $15.00 for Win8 that I will keep.Our old vacuum kept clogging and after 7+ years, so I was finished. It kept losing suction, even after cleaning it out every time I used it. The top wouldn't stand up as the latch broke a few years ago, and cat litter would spill out. Yummy. We figured the motor was just worn out. Since we have fairly new carpet, we wanted to keep it clean and make it last. I browsed around again and found the nice Eureka above. Holy crapola, talk about suction! Lightweight and it all works great. No more messy cleanups :)Dave knew I just wanted a little stocking stuffer for Christmas (I'm ms. practicality) so when we both spotted the Black and Decker yesterday, while getting the vacuum, he grabbed one for me. Thanks Dave! Our last one was 15 years old or more, and they're great getting into odd spaces and really fast. It also won't strip anything with too much torque from a power drill. Happy, happy....No Brown Thursday/Black Fridays Here-I did Black Friday years ago, but never again. My view is if you're a smart shopper (like getting the HP computer online) why bother? I also like to sleep and and relax the day after Thanksgiving, and make more handmade gifts. My daughter has a part-time holiday job and had to be at work at 8 p.m. Thanksgiving night. That sucked, but I admire her work ethic. Gotta pay the bills. I hope I'm wrong thinking that the stores will be OPEN ALL DAY on Thanksgiving in the future. Ugh. I love Thanksgiving the best of all the holidays, and it's just a distraction now for some. Sad. People get shot over this! 2 Shot Outside Walmart The there was the guy back east who left a toddler alone in a car, but took his new tv home.

I always put a little butter and fresh sage under the breast skin and fill the cavity with tons of fresh sage. I grow my own culinary sage and it's great! I add the same to the stuffing as well. I made a great new recipe for Cranberry Conserve this year. I used 1/2 the pecans (too spendy) and a little less sugar. Everyone LOVED it! I also made-roasted yams with a little butter, brown sugar and cinnamon,traditional gravy,mashed Yukon gold taters,Pumpkin pie and Indian Pudding for dessert.The kinds brought veggies, salad and a pie. It was great!I sent home jars of conserve, as well as other leftovers, with the kids. I made 2 big qt. jars of turkey stock last night from the carcass. Soup's on the horizon..."},

{"title": "Food Prices, Rustic French Meat Pie, Chicken Feed & Sprouting", "date": "Nov 18, 2012", "text": "French Meat PieFood Prices & Creative Thinking-Reading a lot of other blogs I keep hearing about food prices going up and up. It's true. Here's some things that have helped me do pretty well at the grocery store- *Start some kind of a working pantry, that you add to, and use from, on a regular basis. You can do some of this in your garage depending on your climate, a cabinet with doors will work, but it depends on what you're storing. You can store under beds, in linen closets, you name it. If you have too much stuff in general, free up some space and store food instead! You can eat your other stuff.*We aren't heavy meat eaters, limit that to about 1/2 the week. The rest is some form of vegetarian, protein foods. I use beans for chili, soups and make whole grain pastas.*Our small chest freezer last spring was an excellent investment! I stocked up on a lot of fresh, freezable produce over the summer when prices were low- bell peppers, blueberries, fresh rhubarb from our neighbor, all kinds of things. Buy one now if you don't already have one. Theyr'e pretty reasonable if you shop around.*We don't eat a lot of junk food. I see people loading up on boxed this and that, and I just cringe. I made sour cream noodles the other night, it's so easy! Just cook big, wide egg noodles til done, add sour cream, salt, pepper, chives, stir and all done! Cheap and tasty. I try to stay away from packaged cake mixes, etc., with all the additives. They also tend to be really high sodium. Ditto sodas. Bad for adults and kids. I do break down once in a while and keep something for emergency use, like a scone or brownie mix. No soda at home, I usually drink iced tea or sparkling water. *I shop around, but I don't waste gas driving across town to save a buck, unless I'm going that way anyway.*I go for quality, not quantity, on some things. Cheap produce, for instance, usually goes bad pretty fast.    Ditto cheap ground meats with added water, in tubes. Why buy water? *Save money on bulk in the bulk section for other things like whole oats. *Buy good chocolate :)*Don't buy cereals, make your own or eat hot whole cereals. You can make ahead and heat as needed for kids.*I saw turkeys on sale today for 50 cents a lb., with a $50.00 purchase. I'll go back in a few days and buy one. We were gifted with one for dinner, but I'd like to have one, have the butcher split it in half and freeze it. Great for farther into the winter. Gobble gobble.*Buy some used kitchen stuff for cooking and food prep. We just got an expensive coffee maker for $4.00. I see crock pots, etc. at thrift sotres all the time cheap.Rustic French Meat Pie-I saw this recipe Meat Pie , adapted from here Swiss Chard Pie. I had lots of leftover french roasted chicken (just used herbs de Provence and olive oil), so I decided to try using it for something different. I used my fresh collard greens, left out the rice, used romano instead of the 2 other cheeses. I didn't want to deal with making pie crust, so I used store bought. Since the idea behind many rustic meals like this is use what you have, I did! It's frugality in action :) Pie interior-going into the oven-                                   Next time I will squeeze out more liquid from the cooked greensChicken Feed & Sprouting-I'm wondering what our chicken feed will be by spring? Our chicken feed and winter scratch mix is way up.  Luckily my egg sales pretty much cover that cost and then some. I charge $3.00 a dozen at work and always have buyers. The system works pretty well. I read about sprouting for chickens for feed recently, and so I grew some. I used mung beans. The first time I put some out they weren't too sure. The 2nd time they attacked it!                                    Anya enjoying the heat vent on her bed"},

I check the freezer regularly, and keep an eye on reserves. That includes the 2 x 55 gallon rain barrels. Gotta have water. We have a good filter if we needed it for drinking water. 2 new buckets from Costco.4. Manage Reserves- Get A Good Deal/Barter/Stock Up/Prep- Lately soups, more no-cook foods with winter coming. After getting a cold and minor cough I made sure I refilled the homeopathic stuff in the medicine cabinet closet, it really nipped it in the bud! :) Almost all gone!!! I used Coldcalm and Chestal Cough Syrup. Before I found these two items (at Walgreen's) I used to get REALLY sick, now it's about gone and no side affects. We finally bought a Sazall for various jobs, only $25.00! I bought a couple of warm, polar fleece tops and a pair of sweat pants for the cold weather. After Sandy storm I kind of did a mental inventory of what kind of warm pants I had, besides jeans or cords? I have sweats now, will buy a few more pairs soon. The forecast is in the 20's at night by the end of the week...5. Eat the Food- Try New Foods/Recipes- Tried some new, Progresso chicken noodle canned soups for my cold, yummy! Not as good as homemade but I wasn't up to making some. Been working on lots of acorn squash, great with some butter, brown sugar and cinnamon.6. Build Community Food Systems- Selling eggs to 2 co-workers. Got some free fruit from 2 friends.7. Recycle/Re-Use- Scraps to hens. We put the chicken sun room back up, put some of the leaves into compost pile, rest in the garden.8. Skill Up- Reading new recipes to try. Will start sprouting for the girls soon.9. Regenerate What is Lost/Salvage Something- Dave took out a fairly dead, big shrub in the front yard. It will open up some space for another fruit tree (dwarf) or maybe some raspberries in the spring. Opening up more planting space is always good! Thrift Find-I hit a local thrift store yesterday and found this, for $4.00, added new batteries, works great!The globe is actually glass, and it's a very heavy resin. It's be great for the holiday/winter season :)"},

I actually like the skins on, but it probably didn'tt have the same delicate texture. I added a tiny bit of cinnamon to the sugar and a dusting of nutmeg on top of the apples. I just love those flavors! I think my skillet was a little too big, next time I'll use more apples. Here's the pan bubbling away-It's always tricky flipping something boiling hot, but I flipped it onto a foil-covered baking sheet just fine.

The good news is that if you know it's coming you can be better prepared. I always keep lots of winter/storm supplies on hand, just in case. I've learned the hard way that when things GO it may be too late. Here's a good little video with some ideas:My Power's Out- Now What?Chicken Sun Room-Now that the cold weather has set in we reassembled our chicken \"sun room\" from last year. It's made with almost all recycled parts, like glass shower doors from the local Habitat store, salvaged wood, etc. It gives the hens more room, about double the space of the coop, to spread out in really bad wet/ultra cold temps (think 10 degrees or less). We have a screen door for when it's more moderate or a glass door. We can still let them out in the garden too as needed. Dave put out a fresh layer of pine shavings (deep litter method) after we let the soil dry out for a week or so. Works great! Dave built a new perch too, as the old one hanging from the chain wasn't much liked by the girls...  They're working on some scratch mix I threw in, yummy!First Snow/Fresh Cabbage/Last Tomatoes/Last Herbs-After the cold weather set in and the first snow hit the foothills, I decided to harvest my fresh cabbage. Great smell and flavor! Three small heads, but hey, I planted them in the summer. About large apple to grapefruit sized. I used the last of my counter top-ripened tomatoes on top of a Big Pep pizza from Papa Murphy's. There were some wonderful varieties mixed together, especially the orange/red heirloom variety- I added some oregano, garlic powder and Parmesan on top, WOW!!! Amazing...I also harvested the last of my oregano and lemon thyme, now drying on the counter-It's great to have several bags of dried organic herbs for the winter﻿"},

I used this recipe- Banana Bread and it came out great! I was a little short on the banana, so I subbed a little apple sauce. I also added 1 cup of chopped pecans. Very moist and not too sweet! One of my favorite breakfasts as a kid on a cold, rainy morning was a slice of banana bread and a cup of hot cocoa! I used my own eggs from today too, and funny- they all use the same nesting box, with the other two empty, go figure...Winter Prep-The garden is finally put to bed, coop deep cleaned, compost spread, it's rained twice and so it looks kind of sad, but hey, it's winter soon! We'll put up the chicken \"sun room\" in another week or so for their extra winter space in really nasty weather. They LOVED it last year.The first snow is forecast for tomorrow night in the foothills, it's hitting the 30's at night now. The news says it'll hit the upper 20's next week. I keep a close eye on the girls this time of year- we'll turn on the waterer heat so the water won't freeze, then eventually turn on the condo Ceramic Infrared Disc . I found it's much cheaper to use than a red light, they'll last for years. They're also a gentle heat and very safe. I found ours at the local PetSmart in the reptile section.Rosie digging for worms in the raised bed, they're only allowed in there now. Cabbages about ready to harvestI see something!!!!﻿"},
{"title": "Being Prepared For Food Emergencies, Good Deal For Food Storage?", "date": "Oct 20, 2012", "text": "Being Prepared For Food Emergencies-Last month was National Emergency Preparedness Month. I've been thru earthquakes in S. California, and ice storms that left me without power for 3 days with no heat. As with any emergency, whatever it might be, it's PLANNING AHEAD that counts. We've been hit with various financial emergencies due to medical situations. I don't have the storage room for huge amounts of home canned food, or the room to grow everything we eat in this climate. I randomly look around for possible dried foods to buy to store. Some you can eat as needed, some might be for real emergency use only. With fuel prices up produce is going up some here too. Fresh is always best, but then there's the spoilage issue. I see many \"mainstream\" folks who blog still only relying on going to the grocery store, period. Those people really worry me as to their long-term situation. While I'm not a gloom and doomer hoarding food and shotguns, it's good to be realistic. One blizzard here could cut off the highways to grocery trucks that deliver. The stores would be empty fast. Ditto any other closure to the highways. Ditto quakes, while we're not at high risk stuff happens. And usually when you least expect it. That's why it becomes an \"emergency\". Well, duh. Anyway, this got me looking at me email from Costco today....Good Deal For Food Storage?-Anyone have any ideas about these items? Cost ration compared to what you've seen? I know some people rely just on local foods, but in my climate that's pretty limiting (unless I want just taters all winter). I will add- I know some people prefer dried to freeze-dried due to the texture, etc. There's lots of philosophies on which is better, but it does get down to what you can buy, will eat and will store for you, in your circumstances. That's really the bottom line, for me at least.                                                                                    Freeze Dried Fruit Bucket                                                                                     Freeze Dried Veggie BucketHaving our own fresh eggs, dried eggs, dried milk & butter  for long term storage, I'm mostly looking for fruits and veggies. My freezer is full right now, but if we lost power for a while, that would be gone...There is our regular pantry food, but that varies as far as shelf life.                                  Other Things To Think About-And then there's other things to store, WATER being a BIG one for me, as we live in the city in a \"high desert\". I do know where to go locally for open water, IF I could get there and it wasn't frozen. When I see some people in highly dense urban areas who have NO water stored, not even a couple of cheap gallons I shake my head. You can go without food for  a while, but not WATER. Our two 55 gallon rain barrels are full now, and we have a good water filter to use with those. If they were frozen and we needed those that would be exciting :(  I do have several gallon water jugs stored and am going to buy more going into winter.... It's cheap when you don't need them :)Some good additional info here, Ready.gov , the Red Cross and others have some too."},

Making bigger batches of stuff to save time and use leftovers better. I always roast 2 chickens at a time when I do that, and that makes for simple dinners over several nights. Using applesauce from the freezer, veggies, misc. stuff from pantry.6. Build Community Food Systems- Selling extra eggs each week! Farmer's markets are winding down.7.

It's hitting the upper/mid 30's at night and today it was 65. Nice. My oregano and thyme hasn't frozen yet. We haven't had a full fledged freeze yet but soon, maybe next week. 50's for the highs next week, that means winter soon! I am so ready. This was THE longest, hottest summer I can remember, with NO summer rain storms. I just hope we get some SNOW this winter!

Pine shaving in a bale are about $10.00 here, enough for a full cleaning, we just add a little extra. So for about $11.00 you can use it for about 3-4 months. Over time we add another inch or two in the main coop and the upper \"condo area\" and nesting boxes. I clean the condo and nesting boxes daily, or every other day. Dave emptied the coop today, spread in the garden, all done! Nice and fresh and clean. It's pretty dirty/dusty, but it's only done 3-4 times a year. It took about an hour.Bottoms up!

It's from Bosnia, and the small sample I tasted had a very nice flavor. Smooth and silky. Just sugar, plums, citric acid, pectin.Cooling Off-It's finally cooling off more. 80's this week, 70's next week. The horrible forest fire smoke is dissipating finally. Hoping for some much needed rain soon. At least the sky is blue again, with just a little haze..."},

I harvested the last of my rhubarb today, my neighbor's freebies, and all totaled I had about 11 lbs.! Woho! I had planned on doing more rhubarb sauce since Dave likes it. I like it too, so why not? It's tart, but sweetened with other fruit and some sugar, it's good! A nice side dish with pork, chicken, with toast, whatever. My \"recipe\" is posted from the spring-2 cups 1\" chunks rhubarb2 cups strawberries, cut in 1/21/4 water1/4 - 1/2 cup sugar: depends on the ripeness of the berries. You could use agave nectar, honey, whatever.pinch saltBring to a simmer, stirring once in a while, until it starts to break down, about 10-15 minutes. Remove from heat and let sit. Stir once in a while as it cools. I canned mine, but you could freeze.I bought local plums yesterday at the farmer's market, and some gorgeous apples, peaches, bell peppers & lemon cukes-All for $15.00I used up last weeks table grapes from our friends farm-the Farmer's Market plums and the strawberries I got at the grocery store- So I have 3 combos with my totals-6 Qts. strawberry/rhubarb sauce2 Qts.and 1 pint plum/rhubarb sauce, gorgeous color!2 Qts. grape/rhubarb sauce. That should last the til next spring or so. I'm hoping to get apples from the same place as the grapes in Oct. to make applesauce. We loved ours from our tree last year! Our apple harvest is poor this year, so I use what I can get. No apples? Use rhubarb.  I'm hearing pinging!!!Independence Days-1. Plant Something- Done for the time being with the veggies, planted a new evergreen shrub.2. Harvest Something- Eggs, tomatoes (wonderful!), rhubarb, basil, thyme, rosemary, chives, jalapenos, a few blackberries. Eggplants almost ready!3. Preserve Something- I got out my old food dehydrator and dried, several squashes, all my jalapenos, 3 big bell peppers. Froze more bell peppers. Canned today. Tonight I also received free watermelon, several bell peppers, greens beans from our friends, again! I'll probably dry more of the new squash and peppers. 4. Manage Reserves- Get A Good Deal/Barter/Stock Up/Prep- Got good deals at the local Farmer's Market, neighbors freebies she doesn't want, bought chicken feed before needed since it's going up. Bought 3 more LED yard lights clearance at Target. All their garden stuff is clearance priced. 5. Eat the Food- Try New Foods/Recipes- Made new kinds of rhubarb sauce. Eating the tomatoes as I pick them. Wish I had enough to can. I saw some lamb summer sausage yesterday at the Farmer's Market, may buy some next Sat., when we go back.6. Build Community Food Systems- Buying from friends, Farmer's Market, freebies from neighbor.7. Recycle/Re-Use- Same old, scraps to chickens, composting.8. Skill Up- Learned about new kinds of mouse traps! We have some in the garage and I DON'T want them in the house. I baited the garage and the back deck, where we've seen them or their droppings. Reading Storm Gourmet with interesting recipes for cooking without power. Interesting timing with hurricane Issac.9. Regenerate What is Lost/Salvage Something- Washed up food dehydrator, starting to use again. Added more bark mulch to part of the back yard to keep the plants happy over the winter. Fixing up rain barrels, pruned the berry vines. I was trying to figure out WHY our tomatoes were so much taller and more prolific this year, then I remembered we pruned the maple tree back when it was thinned, for better light in the garden, duh. It sure worked! The tomatoes below are about 5' high!Garden Prepping for Fall-It's finally cooling off! It's so much nicer to do outside work in the 80's. In the next week or so it's forecast to start lowering to the 70's! I did alot of pruning back the berry vines, raked, added the new LED solar lights, planted a new evergreen shrub where one died, fixed up the little pond a bit. Dave did some of the same in the front yard today. Fall will be coming soon, so I try to do a little each weekend so it's not so overwhelming when the weather gets to the first hard freeze. Added a HUGE amount of rhubarb leaves to the compost today, big LEAVES! They reminded me of elephant ears.                                   Anya cuddling her favorite fuzzy blankie late in the evening"},

Once, in 2011, when I was stopped at John F.

Sometimes people blog about what they shop for for their home (decor, collectibles, etc.) and while I have done that too, I've been re-focusing. Buying more \"cutesy decor\" won't feed your family in a pinch. I've seen food prices rising already. I have been working on not eating out as much, and buying more large bulk items of healthy staples. Buying and storing lots of small bottled waters, marshmallows and junk food won't keep you healthy. I'm looking at- what can I freeze, can, dry, etc.? I dragged out my old dehydrator the other day, scrubbed it, and fired with up with 4 squash! It all adds up-All the squash in the basket at the top dryingAll driedDried food takes up much less space- 4 squashes in 1 jar! It took about 5 hoursTime for an update on this:1. Plant Something- Nurturing the volunteer and mystery squashes/pumpkins. Planted a pear tree in the last 2 weeks.2. Harvest Something- Eggs, as finally the 2 new girls are laying most days, eggs are getting bigger! Herbs, tomatoes, hot peppers, and compost that was spread over veggie bed 3 days ago. More rhubarb, & collard greens are ready. I may freeze some of the greens. Lemon thyme, rosemary and tarragon.   3. Preserve/Store Something- Dried all my gifted squash for the winter for soups. Froze 6 bell peppers, 4 pints of fresh blueberries, 2 more large packs of chicken parts. Will dry the grapes this weekend, didn't get to them yet. With the 3-day weekend I'm planning on buying some strawberries, maybe local peaches and canning some mixed rhubarb sauce. I'll also do some plain rhubarb sauce. Drying some bunches of lemon thyme, rosemary and tarragon.4. Manage Reserves- Get A Good Deal/Barter/Stock Up/Prep- See above, good deal chicken, veggies, fruit.5. Eat the Food- Try New Foods/Recipes- Dried squash for winter to use in soups. Using up various stuff. The refrigerator pickles I made last month came out great, very crunchy!6. Build Community Food Systems- Working with daughter's boyfriend whose parents own a farm. Will buy more grapes, then apples in Oct. since ours failed this year.  7. Recycle/Re-Use- Cleaned up side yard in back and re-purposed some stuff, stored for later use. Made a temporary chicken hospital out of scrap wood, fencing, etc.8. Skill Up- Thinking about taking a Spanish class, reading Storm Gourmet from the Library about cooking during power outages and bad weather. Some good ideas!9. Regenerate What is Lost/Salvage Something- backyard clean up, salvaged some items like scrap wood.Drying lemon thyme, rosemary and tarragon"},

What a relief! It was in the low 50's last night, also nice to wake up to. For a REAL change I made a pot of hot Irish Breakfast tea for breakfast with some toast and homemade peach jam. That hit the spot! The day are getting much shorter, and while I still water daily, the garden is making more of a come back from the heat. My nasturtium basket, which had barely bloomed in the heat, is now loaded with flowers! The two young New Hampshire Red hens are both laying fairly consistently now, what a treat! I love having LOTS of eggs! I made a Spanish fritatta 2 days ago with the surplus. Weather-wise I don't envy the folks in Florida bracing for the hurricane, but we still have major smoke to suffer thru, ick. It's been so long with these smoky skies I actually don't remember when they started? Three weeks ago or longer? I actually don't know...4-Legged Furry Alarm-We love Anya, our sweet cat we adopted a while back. For some reason, unbeknownst to the rest of the world, she thinks about 5:15 a.m. is a good time to get up. And get US up :(  At bedtime we usually close our bedroom door and she stays out in the rest of the house. About 5:15 every stinking day for the last few weeks she starts meowing REALLY LOUD right outside the bedroom door. I usually get up about 7, Dave 6:45ish. She was de-clawed by the previous owners. While meowing she tries to claw the underside of the bedroom door. Clunk, clunk, clunk. OMG, it drives me insane! Dave usually sleeps thru it :) I joke with him that he'd sleep thru a nuclear blast. I'm not joking however. I have tried leaving her in the room with us, door open, no change. Anyway, so I get up and feed her, problem solved. BUT NO,  back to the meowing and clawing the door 5 minutes later. \"Let me in, I need some love!\". OMG, so I let her in the bedroom. She goes up and down the bed, repeatedly, while I pet her, eyes shut trying to SLEEP. It's now 6. Off the bed, she's now on my dresser, trying to get up on the window sill. \"Get down\" I say, clapping my hands. 6:15. She's back on the bed. Will it ever end? Please somebody just shoot me. It's 6:30. So.............I did some problem-solving and it worked great last night: Cat gets a snack right before my bedtime (I'm most always last). Cat goes into spare bedroom where cat box resides. Cat gets bowl of water. Cat gets Dave's favorite blankie off the main couch. Cat gets carried to and petted there. Cat gets warning to go to sleep or else! I turn off the lights, close the door. I close my door and get in bed. And wait, and wait. No sound, nothing. I wake up 7 hours later! Uninterrupted sleep! Still nothing. Went back to sleep. Dave got up an hour later, I hear cat meows, Dave lets her out, feeds her. I roll over. An hour later (yes, I REALLY needed some major sleep) cat is at door, cat's let in and cuddled. Cat goes to sleep on bed,  all is well..... then hens start squawking... sometimes like Roseann Rosannadanna said \"it's always something...\"Anya trying to eat a paper bag, who knew?Great Deals To Preserve-I got some great deals today at the local grocery outlet of peppers (6 for $1.50) and blueberries $2.00 each. Both from Canada, kind of different, but seemed very fresh. I bought 4 lbs. of grapes from my daughter's boyfriend for $1.50 a lb. His parents raise table grapes at their farm outside Boise. I'm going to freeze the peppers & blueberries and dry the grapes.

After reading El Nino To Bring Cooler Wetter Winter I'm hopeful we'll get some rain/snow this fall/winter to end our horrible fire season and fill up the aquifers. The idea of snow is always fun, since we usually don't get much in Boise. We do have some white stuff every year or so, and I enjoy it like a kid! I also love the rain here as it always greens things up. I am ready for Fall!!!Blog Photos Gone- Smart Phone Warning-Being a bit of a techy I do appreciate some aspects of \"advanced\" technology. Then, sometimes, there's just \"too much of a good thing\". Most of my photos have disappeared off this blog (when I have WAY to much time on my hands I may try to re-create them). Good news- I didn't actually lose the photos (have them backed up on an external hard drive), just lost them from my blog. Here's how, so you will be be forewarned: Hubby got a new \"smart phone\" with our free upgrade. Smart phone has new GMail account attached to our email. Somehow the settings uploaded, thru his email (attached to my blog) ALL MY BLOG PHOTOS, except for a few. When we saw his \"gallery\" was full on his phone, with over 4,000 photos, we deleted them. THE SMART PHONE (not so smart) DIDN'T TELL US IT WAS DELETING THEM FROM MY BLOG :)  God, I love technology. The next day, I opened my blog. Almost every photo gone. I thought, at first, \"Gee maybe there's problem with blogger?\". Then I cried. One year of work gone, poof. Then I cried some more. Then I recovered and realized atleast I had all the pics backed up. Then I realized it all had to do with the SMART PHONE. We can't delete his email as my entire blog might be inaccessible, so we adjusted his settings. For now we're okay, and he's logged off his G Mail on his phone. I discovered he was \"synced\" to Picasa Web and evidently my blog. He's now permanently \"unsynced\". Sometimes it pays to be a Luddite. Hmmm, there's a hammer nearby and hubby's out watering :)"},

I will be cutting back on my blogging, as I will be busy. I envy people who can afford to stay home full time or are retired. The things I could do year round!!!

While I haven't gotten thru all of them, there are some that really stood on for me. Many brought tears to my eyes and reminded me of my Mom's stories of the Depression in rural Nebraska- drinking coffee a child, since there was little milk. Not being able to eat chicken or eggs as an adult, since they raised their own and that's almost all they ate meat-wise. Walking two miles to school in the winter with frostbite, having their hands shoved under the cold water spigot in the one room school house, and hearing their knuckles crack as they thawed. Being the youngest and rarely having anything new, including clothes. There were good stories too- of her Dad bartering his mechanic's services for food they couldn't grow or afford. My Mom said Grandma raised chickens, had a very large garden, canned, baked, sewed, knitted and made quilts. All that NORMAL STUFF. It's sad that I never knew her, since she died when I was a baby. I bought a Rhode Island Red chick (one of my first) as a little tribute to her since she has some back then. She sounded like quite a woman! She always looked old in her photos, even when she was younger. That kind of life would surley do that to you, raising four girls in tough times.It really put things into perspective about where we are now- how spoiled and self-centered many of us are in America. Many families survived only due to the ongoing help of family and friends, and ingenuity too! Many in this country simply have no interest in learning those skills. That's sad...I listed these by category- ﻿CLOTHING- \"I was in the third grade when the Depression came. I remember it well. There were nine of us. I had no shoes, so my dad made a pair out of cardboard and glued it together. When we ran out of glue and had no money to buy more, we used rubber bands and a paste made with flour and water. When it rained, I was soaked. I had no umbrella, no rubbers and no raincoat, and stayed in school the whole day in wet clothes until I went home.\" - Gladys Saba Wright, age 89, Richmond Heights\"I remember that my mother took down the white cotton curtains from the back windows of our house in order to make blouses for our school uniforms. She did not have enough spare cash to spend on either the blouses or the material to make them.\" - Geraldine Stevens, age 85, Worthington\"Our family had a mantra, which was: 'Use it up, wear it out; Make it do, or do without.' We did this with everything. My mother and grandmother were seamstresses, and my mother made nearly all of my clothes, including suits and coats, throughout my college years. My after-school play clothes were frequently made from feed sacks, the patterned, cotton bags that contained the chicken feed my grandparents fed to their chickens. The cloth was durable, quite colorful and survived many washings. I never had to worry that I would find someone else wearing the same clothes I had! My grandmother went a bit farther. Ladies' clothes in those days had long, full skirts (no such things as slacks or pants for women). Once a dress was worn out, the still-good material would be made into a blouse. When the blouse was no longer wearable, it became an apron. When the apron finally was not usable, what was left became a dust rag. My great aunt and many of the women in the small town where they all lived were quilters, and every scrap of material left from the original garment was hand sewed into beautiful patchwork quilts, then quilted during the evening hours when the work of the day had been finished. These, of course, were our winter blankets.\" - Mary Lou Pollak, age 78, Fairview ParkAnyone know what breed these are???      FOOD- \"My earliest memories of the Great Depression go back to people coming to our door, selling big red delicious apples for five cents each. My father was a minister and five cents was hard to come by. Once in a great while, there would be a spare five cents to purchase one of those delectable apples. It was carefully cut into five pieces and distributed. As a seven-year-old, I wondered if the time would come when I could have a whole apple to myself.\" - Elinor M. Brown, age 85, Napoleon\"When my husband was about eight or nine years old, his mother sent him to the store to get some soup beans to cook for their supper. He had to walk down a hill that was a little over a mile long. On his way home, the bag in which the beans were broke and the beans spilled onto the ground. When he got home and told his mother what happened, she gave him another container and told him to go back and pick up the beans, so he went back and picked up every bean. Another time, he sat down at the table to eat breakfast and his mother said to him 'I don't know what you are going to eat because we only have some homemade bread and milk.' So she broke up some bread in a bowl with some milk, and that was his breakfast.\" - Irene Burkhart, about her husband, Lawrence, age 86, Shadyside\"On a normal weekday, they would eat vegetable soup that included pretty much whatever they could scrounge up from the leftover food. They grew their own garden in their back yard, full of green beans, carrots, peas, sweet potatoes and regular potatoes. If they were lucky, they would eat chicken as a specialty on Sundays. Their family owned their own chickens and rabbits. The local grocery would call Grandma's house when the meat came in; that way they could get to the store before it was all gone. Everyone used stamps as the form of money, due to the fact that food and gas were rationed. These stamps bought most of their food for the month. They never went out to eat. Every night, when the boys arrived back home, they would eat with each other at the dinner table.\" - Meg Denman, sophomore at Madison Comprehensive High School, about her grandmother, Marcella Denman, age 92, Mansfield\"Dad had built a Fruit Cellar in our basement and it was all concrete. This is where the jelly and canned goods were stored. There was always a large sack of flour and a bucket of lard, and my mother would make wonderful bread and rolls, and pies from the apple orchard and the berries we picked. Her pies would have won prizes. Because of my parents ingenuity I don't recall going hungry. Mother was a great cook, and what ever she made was delicious. Bacon was bought in a slab that you would slice off. Somehow, we always had real butter, but it was about 19 cents a pound. Mother made very good salad dressing with a bit of bacon grease, vinegar and a dash of sugar and salt in a skillet. This was poured over leaf lettuce from the garden or dandelions. Lots of people came to our home and ask for apples from our orchard. Mom would always give them some.\" - Martha Rosella McCabe, age 88, Saint Clairsville\"Mom canned as many things as she could, such as tomatoes, green beans and fruits of various kinds. But the mainstay of our diet during the lean years was a combination of dried beans, cornbread, onions and potatoes of one kind or another. Mom would cut dandelion greens for some added nutrition and cook them in bacon fat with a little vinegar on them.\" - Wanda Stubbart, age 78, Columbus, Vic Thomas, age 83, Middletown and Kathleen Lambert, age 80, Middletown    RECREATION- \"Toys were at a premium. We used to find a bushel basket, knock the bottom out of it, nail it up on some garage and that was our basketball net. To play football, we could not afford equipment, so we just played without it.\" - Raymond J. Mock, age 85, Centerville\"A sled was a sheet of cardboard and McKinley Monument was the best hill. The park to play in was Water Works Park. In the summer, it was Myers Lake Park for the grocery store picnic. Ice cream from Islays was an extra treat once or twice a year in the summer - my Grandmother always bought. The ice man gave us all chunks of ice from his truck. We also had a milk man and a bread man, when we could afford them. We took rides in the car on Sunday afternoon and walked to church every Sunday morning. Watching movies a couple times a year at Dueber Theater was an extra special treat. We played, kick the can, hide and seek, tag, hop scotch, red rover, jump rope, etc. There were a lot of fun times, as everybody shared the same hard times. We kids really didn't know we were poor.\" - Doris Portmann, age 76, Navarre\"Dad made us some toys and we would spend time at night before bed time playing games. Mom would sit by the kerosene lamp and read letters or stories out of a book for us. They loved us so much. At bed time, she would get bricks out of the oven on cold nights and wrap them in towels and put them in our beds to warm up the bed and keep us warm. There was no heat in our bedroom or insulation in the ceiling, walls or floor, so it got very cold.\" - Carl Reed, age 76, Malvern\"We entertained ourselves, playing board games, outdoor hide-and-seek type of games, roller skating as fast as we could around the block or listening to radio serials such as 'Don Winslow of the Navy' or 'Jack Armstrong.' We read a lot of books from the library. We learned about the outside world from LIFE magazine, a large glossy format that was a veritable history of memorable photographs. The swimming pool season ticket was $2. Going to a movie cost a dime. There was no air conditioning, but the Ohio Theater was comfortably 'air cooled' with fans blowing across blocks of ice. Broughton's Ice Cream had sodas and sundaes for 12 cents, while an ice cream cone was a nickel. S. S. Kresge was full of wondrous items you could buy for a nickel or dime, many of them now collector's items.\" - Esther G. Schwartz, age 77, Columbus\"There was an ice house on the corner of Nevada and Parker, and we kids would go there to get free chunks of ice. Sometimes in the summer, we went there and got chips of ice to make our own ice cream. We all took turns grinding it until done, but what a treat it was for us! Our toys were mostly handmade. My brothers made their scooters out of orange crates and wheels, when they could find them. We girls made our own dancing dolls out of hollyhocks. What imaginations! For adult entertainment, Friday nights was usually Pinochle night with the neighbors, at their house or ours. We never had a sitter, so when it was at the neighbors, my brothers watched me. We played games such as hide and seek with a candle lit to find each other - it's a wonder we never started any fires! Also, my brothers made a basketball net over their bedroom door from a box and, having no ball, they used my favorite muff - I hated that!\" - Mary Johnson Shank, age 77, Toledo                                                                        Anyone know what breed these are???"},

They're great for a quick dinner and cheaper than my discount grocery store, go figure. Here's my $30.00 haul: nutmeg nuts, teas, bow-shaped pastas, some chocolate, crackers and the stuffed pastas. I am happy! I like to add this kind of thing once in a while to my basic food storage. I think there's a difference between eating well and eating cheap. While I go mostly for whole foods, I do buy small amounts of \"packaged foods\", like the stuffed pastas. By the way, the pasta make a pretty big batch...Cost Plus had some new items that I loved, because they had CHICKEN WIRE!!! I also loved a few vintagey looking items they had, gave me some ideas of thing to make or re-purpose:I love one of these for my kitchen cornerMaybe for my bathroom?Maybe for ???Only $7.00, but I don't know where I'd put it...More chicken wireAnd these were just too cute- chalk paint with a clothes pin on the back, what a great idea!I could use these in my herb pots.

Short version, it's a place that's just sort of sitting there. Too overpriced to move, but Grandma won't retire :)  Too bad, I had to leave empty handed. TONS of vintage and antiques and over 4,000 sq.ft.. Maybe someone will wake up and make some sales some day-Gorgeous Spain-I've been reading and watching documentaries about Spain the last few years. I found some gorgeous photos of a \"hotel\" called Trasierra, north of Seville. It was lovingly restored, as you can see. Amanda Brooks is an author, blogger and fashionista (a what?) who has documented her travels recently. Gorgeous photos, so now I REALLY want to go to Spain!  Not in the budget, but I can be inspired :) I love the rooms she took shots of! Now for a virtual tour. Her book and website is I Love Your Style How restful, don't you think?Nice vintage basket collection on the wallsHow green and inviting! I love the HUGE flowering vinesI love the simple blue and whites. Love the wood door, great textureI love this! Notice the little tiled border on the sides next to the white walls? Little planters, what a nice touch! Talk about meticulous details."},

The smoke made it look like our city was on fire. It was so smoky, that you could smell it immediately going outside, and you could see it looking down a long street. My asthma has been pretty bad the last week or so, yesterday was not fun. These fires are reportedly not going to get under control until the first SNOW. That's right S N O W. That means October, unless we get some heavy rain before then. I feel for the fire crews (and their families) working in this horrendous heat, pushing 100. We are all so grateful for the work they do. These men and women don't get paid enough, and some die every year. Going out tonite on an errand we could see a HUGE cloud of smoke behind the foothills, looking east, towards one of the big fires. We missed the one fire north of here by 2 hours, on our way back from McCall two weeks ago. Lucky timing for us!             Wildfires Threaten Idaho Towns-We even made in onto Rueters News, the huge international news conglomerate- Wildfires In The West"},

Some can choose that path, but it may be painful. I have noticed in my own discount grocery stores that food prices are still going up. And the harvest season is not over. While not wanting to be alarmist- we need to put on our big girl/big boys pants and do some more work. Whining about not being able to afford a turkey for bird day in November won't get one on the table. Get it :) So here's a few things I found were concise and make some excellent points-Special thanks to Ohio Farmgirl for the amazing links on her blog! Close Up Look At The 2012 Drought will be really helpful in understanding that this is a GLOBAL DROUGHT, not an American one. I have read this basic info plenty of other places, and please take the time to read it. START BUYING MORE FOOD TO STORE, NOW. I don't mean over priced, plastic containers of kid-sized fruit servings. Buy gallons, they're easy to store. Join something like Costco if you can, (or something similar) if you don't have access to those kinds of canned foods. I know many of you can, and preserve food like in various ways. We're way ahead of the curve there. I'm going to be investing in some Gamma Lids at my regular grocery store, to go with my pre-existing buckets. With  much of our produce being imported from other countries who are ALSO having droughts, stock up. I'm doing what I can here and will keep at it. Another point too- what do you do if your spouse isn't quite on board? Time for those \"crucial conversations\". Have them read more about this, do what you can. They'll thank you later :) I have talked to my adult children, but I think they don't get it :(  Don't forget your pets too, as most of those foods are also grain-based! And in the interest of feeding my chickens too...Finding Free Chicken Food-I was thinking the other day about how many places throw away scraps of fresh produce that would be great, free food for chickens. I'm going to nose around a one business I know, that serves meals to kids and throws a way a lot of food. Most daycare centers/preschools, retirement centers all do this, churches and any other places you can brainstorm about too. I think most people don't like actually throwing away food in the trash. It just takes some courage to ask and explain what you want, don't create work for them, and keep it simple. Give me some feedback if you have some ideas? Now that's recycling!Free Cheese Recipes-I found this little gem here Free Cheese Recipes Enjoy!!!"},

I sat down, did a major edit of all the recipes, and made them fit. Presto changeo!I can pull out what I need-Much tidier looking-New Fruit Tree-We had been looking all over town for another fruit tree to plant, since we're wanting to grow more of our own food. We already have an apple and nectarine tree. Fruit trees are usually marked down in the summer, but I'd given up as everyone was out of stock in the last month. Then, lo and behold, going into Lowe's yesterday- FRUIT TREES!!! 25% off, and we got a nice, healthy, semi-dwarf Bartlett Pear tree for $15.00. It looks lop-sided, some of the branches grew to the left a bit in the nursery, but should correct itself. We'll add a tree stake in a week. Here's the new baby we planted today-Here's the apple tree we planted 4 years ago in a similar spot-Thrifting- I hit a yard sale yesterday, and got a plastic jar full of cookie cutters for $1.00-All the holidays are covered, and then some :)and a nice punch tin lamp, also a buck-Fall Prims-﻿I saw these and LOVED them!

I spotted a baby eggplant tonite, my first! Sadly not much in the way of apples and nectarines this year. I may have to just buy apples for applesauce, etc. this year :(3. Preserve/Store Something- Made refrigerator pickles & strawberry jam. I bought more pine nuts ($15.00 a lb., ouch!) so I'll make a lot of pesto for the freezer. Put pine nuts in the fridge this time so they won't go rancid in this heat.4. Manage Reserves- Get A Good Deal/Barter/Stock Up/Prep- Got some free veggies from the farmers market, stocked up on chicken parts to freeze, more misc. stuff at Costco.5. Eat the Food- Try New Foods/Recipes- Used up old apples into a blueberry/apple cobbler, wonderful! Going thru old recipes & cookbooks for more vegetarian dishes that are healthier and cheaper. Made Tennessee Cornpone and pesto from my huge basil (I started from seed) for yummy wholegrain linguine pasta.6. Build Community Food Systems- Bought some veggies at a farmer's market coming back from McCall, raspberry items and Healing Salve at the festival up north. The raspberry vinegar is AMAZING!!! More free rhubarb from neighbor. Bought some local baked good today.7. Recycle/Re-Use- Composting, bought more used clothes for work I need to tailor a bit, re-purposed a dresser into canning cabinet, used vintage glass canning jars missing glass lids into candle holders.8.

It sucks. It's so dry and hot I can barely do any yard work except first thing in the morning. It's was 90 at 10 p.m. tonite! Miserable, but I am grateful to have A/C and that luxury. What a thing to come back to after a great road trip!101 but it got hotter laterRoad Trip-Dave took a week off, so we did a two-day road trip, what we could afford. We went to a Raspberry Festival up north in Cottonwood, Idaho. It's on the property of St. Gertrude's Monastery, with female monastics. We'd gone there years ago with the three kids to see what it was like and had a great time. They had a huge quilt contest that time, but sadly, not this year. They have all organic gardens, and have a very sustainable lifestyle, growing almost all their own food. I'm not Catholic, but I love the art work and vibe of the place. We took a tour of the church there, just gorgeous. Most of the sisters are older and very kind. I bought raspberry jam, vinegar, and \"healing salve\". They served a wonderful lunch, with live bluegrass music- pulled pork sandwiches, slaw, raspberry lemonade and a HUGE dessert of cocoa cake and fresh crushed raspberries and whipped cream. Dave and I split one dessert, as it was so big. WOW, we were full after that! It was pretty cute going by a very rural golf country club nearby, with a parking lot of brand new, shiny pickup trucks. Not something you see in the city! Since it was a long drive (5 1/2 hours) we stopped in McCall, a gorgeous mountain town for the night. We had camped south of there a couple of weeks ago. We found a really nice place to stay for the night for a great price. Clean and quiet, and tried some new restaurants and hit some thrift stores :) I almost had a coronary when I got home and the chicken waterers were EMPTY, OMG!!! I had kept them in the coop due to a local cat problem, for their own safety, with a mister on. The 2 waterers were full when we left but they obviously drank more than I thought they would. One smaller one got knocked over :(  I let them out right away when we got home. I watered them, got them ice chips, and gave them wet oatmeal. They perked up right away. Thankfully we got home when we did, and no one croaked. Lesson learned- get a 2nd gallon waterer if gone. The poor garden just wilted terribly too with no water for almost two days. Now every day it's water-water-water. Here's some photos of the trip-On the way up to St. Gertrude'sthe view from St. Gertrudes, the \"palouse\" plainsThe gorgeous churchIcon by the main entrancePayette Lake, McCallMore Payette LakeGuess what was for sale across the motel's parking lot? A \"Sisters on the Fly\" glamping trailer! I wish I could have seen the inside!!! Great paint job! It was in front of a \"junktique\" store. It was closed, dang! Wanted to go in there...Thrifting-I hit a couple thrift stores before, during and after the road trip. Here's my score-Talk about perfect timing- I got the like-new Thermos jug (with a cup in the top) for $2.00 and we took it on the road!Two Pfaltzgraff mugs- a buck each, another mug, a glass flour jar $2.00. I also got a nice sweater, cord jacket, flannel blouse, nice wool scarf from the U.K., new cord slacks, and a skirt. Great deals!Olympics Mayhem-I stopped watching the Olympics this year, as it too oriented towards professionals (many of them) and not so many true amateurs, IMO. Kristin Armstrong appears to have possibly bribed someone to get her child up on the podium (after being told \"no\" by everyone in authority) to be with her getting her gold medal. She then mysteriously left early and will not be in the closing ceremony. Maybe she was told to leave? Hmmm.... not very nice to break the rules...."},

There was a huge assortment of speciality appliances- 1 serving battery-operated ice cream maker, quesadilla maker, waffle maker, mini-stick waffle maker, and on and on. I thought of all the things people used to make without these speciality appliances! Folks just used a skillet and pot, or improvised. If you buy all these kinds of items, they have to be stored, take up counter space and aren't free. What's the point? It creates an illusion that they can cook. \"Buy this special contraption and you can cook too!\"                          Most young kids think cooking is microwaving food, macaroni and cheese comes from a box with orange powder inside (ew) & cakes come from a boxed cake mix (one of the easiest things you can make from scratch IMO). There's just a warped sense of what cooking is versus what it can be. Cooking can be simple and pretty straight forward. Need a chopper? Not really- buy a good knife and work on your knife skills. Quesadilla maker? Just use your skillet. Mini waffles sticks? Think french toast, and slice em up. I get dizzy just thinking about it. While I do have a food processor (10 years or more old), Magic Bullet and a few other old contraptions, I know how to cook without them. And that's a good thing, as Martha would say...Thrifting- I found two really nice books today for $3.00 total, lots of good home fixes and recipes-These recipes sounded pretty good:Jamming-I found some decent Oregon berries yesterday (pesticide-free) and made some very low sugar jam today from this recipe Low/No Sugar Strawberry Jam  I made a large batch using about 7 cups of berries and added only about 1/2 cup sugar, no fruit juice. It came out really tasting like berries, and not so sugary-I found some $1.00 packs of 75 small decorative labels (to label canned foods) at Target today in their \"home schooling section\", cute!Farm Aid Fun- After reading about the terrible droughts, and wanting to do SOMETHING, I found the Farmaid.org website. I saw these really cute pewter ornaments and ordered them. Really cute and went to a good cause... Now if I could find a place to hang them until December....Dave found this really little egg in our berry bushes. I knew one of the New Hampshires was going to start laying today, man she was squawking!!!! They'll get bigger I'm sure :)Dresser Re-Purposed to Canning Cabinet-We bought this dresser (left the drawers behind) at a local thrift warehouse last week for $6.00. After reading this Build a Canning Cupboard recently Dave and I thought about doing the same. With our more limited woodworking skills and tools, we decided to keep an eye out for something else. When I saw this dresser (some of the drawers were out) I could see it was pretty heavily built. It has nice, solid shelves and is sturdy. I was able to find a 1 qt. jar in the warehouse to check the shelf height (good idea) and it fit great! It was covered with beat up, cheap, plastic wood-look crap. Three coats of antique white satin spray later, it looked nice! It fits perfect in our spare bedroom on the wall opposite our pantry closet. I have room on the bottom for extra jars, and home dehydrated veggies/peppers as well. ..I also found the 50 cent basket and am using it on top for the extra lids, rings and canning tools-I don't mind the little bit of paint overspray on the shelves.

I'd never heard of it before. She posted a crock pot version I'll try later. I decided to try this version- Thebrighthouse.blogspot.com  I did 1/3 more and used a lasagna pan. This recipe is flexible spice-wise. I did pinto beans and added: 1 lg. can canned whole tomatoes loosely mushed, paprika, celery seeds, 2 bunches chopped green onions, Tabasco (about 1 TBL), salt, pepper, garlic powder & thyme. I added about 1/8 cup water to make them more \"saucy\". You can taste as you go before you heat the beans. I heated the bean mixture in the microwave to speed up the cooking. It looked like this-Wet mixture, which REALLY puffs up-Pour on top of beans and bakeI served this with green salad and sweet tea. :)Next time I might try black beans, bell peppers, cilantro, a little cheese in the topping and cayenne.Recipe- 4 cups very juicy cooked and seasoned beans (especially pinto or kidney)2 cups cornmeal2 teaspoons baking soda1 teaspoon salt1 quart of buttermilk2 eggs, slightly beaten1/4 butter (I don't use margarine) Heat beans until quite hot and pour into a lightly greased 9\" x 13\" baking dish. Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Mix the cornmeal, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl. Melt the butter and combine with buttermilk and eggs. Stir the wet and dry ingredients together until smooth and pour them over the hot beans. Bake on the top rack of your oven until bread is a rich golden color and the sides of the corn bread pull away from the sides of the pan. This takes about 30 minutes. Serves 10 to 12.                         Surprise Pumpkins-I finally ID'd my mystery veggies under the cabbages in the cold frame- PUMPKINS! I don't know what kind, but I moved them to a sunnier spot in the cold frame. I'm hoping they're big ones, but who knows? They may have been seeds from the compost pile or the manure we bought. We have 3 good sized ones, and 3 more small ones in the main area. Time will tell...    Makeovers Soon-Dave got a good deal on 4 plastic chairs at a yard sale, a buck a piece. I'm going to paint them forest green, so we'll have enough seating for company soon. I'll be painting the new \"canning cabinet\" I posted a photo of too. We decided against building one from scrap lumber, as we don't have a Sazsall, and it would take a lot more skill than we both have.

After watching my chickens cook for two summers I finally had a brilliant idea! We had a fence border at the edge of the rear coop corner. Behind the coop were two pallets and the components of the winter \"sun room\" we add on to the coop. When I looked at what was past there I realized it was all nice and shaded and had established shrubs- nothing they could damage. Bingo! Dave and I talked design, spent about $20.00 at Home Depot (nothing else to use), it took about an hour and now- fenced in shade! The girls LOVE IT!  We used culled wood,  hardware, and 1 roll of green plastic fencing (1\" holes, 4' high, 25' long), we had some left over. There was storage area behind coop, so Dave later cut the pallets in 1/2 to make more of an open path.New end of fencing, next to the compost bin. Love the duct tape!Girls love the new cooler space!Need to use those onions!Garlic Dill Refrigerator Pickles-I used this recipe Canning Garlic Dill Pickles and modified based on a comment that Cheryl left on her blog-\"We make a refrigerator pickle very similar, but, to make it even easier, the brine does not have to be boiled. Just use cold water and the vinegar (we use all cider vinegar, no white) and they are ready in about 3 weeks. We also add chunks of onion or slices to our jars and I suggest using fresh dill instead of dill seed. It is much more pungent. They will last up to a year in the fridge. We are just finishing up last’s years. I got a little crazy making them and luckily we have an extra fridge in the garage for produce, etc. But, it’s really my pickle fridge! \" Thanks Cheryl!!!I decided to give that a go! Since we have a college-sized fridge in our garage for extra produce, etc., it would work great! I like the idea of using all apple cider vinegar for a little different flavor. I added 1/4 tsp. pickling spice to each pint (1/2 tsp., to each qt.), 1/2 sliced jalapeno (with seeds) to each qt. It was so nice to be able to not heat the brine. Since I had some brine leftover I did 2 qts. of celery, carrots, Vidalia onion chunks and red bell pepper. Now I just have to wait 3 weeks to crunch time! I did realize that I could add some \"pickle crisp\" (finally found some at WalMart) to the cans and so I did. They should be extra crunchy!!! My total was 5 qts. and 4 pints.Choke Cherry Jelly-I planted a Choke Cherry bush in the front yard 3 years ago. It's a native plant here. This is the first year I had a small harvest to do something with. I decided to try a jelly. I realized, after picking, that I probably should have waited about 2-3 weeks later, oh well. I only had about 1/2 cup of berries to work with so I made two 1/2 pints. I know some people wouldn't have bothered but it will be nice come winter. Boiled the cherries for 15 minutes, then my version of a mini jelly juice extractor-                                        the juice was almost lavender colored, very prettySugar, lemon juice, pectin and a little later- jelly!Home Grown Blackberry Tea- I had to trim my blackberry vines, so I thought, \"hey that's tea leaves!\" I carefully removed some leaves, and dried them. Blackberry tea for winter-                   Thrifting-Today I got some great deals- at Cost Plus World Market (where I got a 15 % off coupon in an email) we got: teas, 3 bottles (1 Liter each) of Italian extra virgin olive oil for $4.99 each.

I will post \"after\" pictures-Dave and I went to a farmer's market about 1 p.m., and we got there as everyone one was packing up. I thought they closed at 3 p.m. I wanted to buy something before everything was gone, and spotted some red potatoes. I asked the lady farmer about them. She started bagging some, handed me a bag and said \"here, try these.\". I said, \"let me give you some money\", she said- \"nope, I'd just have to take them home\". Lesson learned- go early for better choices, go late for freebies, or discounts!!! We received about 5 lbs of 2 kinds of gorgeous fresh red tatters. I'll go back early next week and buy more local produce...My best score last week, my 2 BIG down-filled couch pillows, these will be great for winter!

Atleast it was cooler this morning, 70. I won't really be doing a separate Fall garden as there's no room. My summer garden will go til mid-Oct. depending on the weather. I have harvested green tomatoes into Nov. 2. Harvest Something- My first tomatoes, basil, berries are coming in finally. The chickens ate 2 tomatoes. I'm hoping this is not a trend :(  I think it's because we were camping and they didn't get enough snacks :) I also saved some blackbery vine trimmings to make tea out of.3.

It was a blast! Tami only has weekends off and no vacation so we had to keep it to the weekend. They were excellent company and everyone had a great time! I stole Kristina's idea and gifted Tami and I with kerchiefs as a little memento (un-matching though).  Tami got a cute purple floral design, mine's a bright blue standard pattern. We found a campground that is reclaimed BLM land and it's run by a group of seniors. Not being a senior, or an RVer, I wasn't sure what to expect. I'm not an RV fan, as they have been (in my experience) loud and obnoxious. Here's the experience, short version- very clean campground, free firewood, showers/toilets, water, set up more for RV's, but a had some nice tent sites. Very quiet during the day, the staff patrolled on their ATV's. Nice walking trail thru the forest to various edges of the lake, and I got lots of wildflower pics there. Went swimming, watched an eagle (bald?) swing down and catch a fish, hung out in camp and read. Then night fell, still fine, as we did dinner and smores, I went and took a nice hot shower, and watched the stars come out. I was tired and relaxed.As we got into the tent about 11:30 we realized the air mattress wasn't inflated hard, mistake, but figured we'll fall asleep. FYI- Dave can sleep anywhere and thru an atomic bomb blast. First, an RV nearby had something that kept cycling, every 10 minutes or so, for hours. I almost went over there, but decided in the interest of personal safety to stay in my tent. Then the screaming (this is why I don't drink) on the other end of the facility went on for a short while. Then the dogs barked. At 2 a.m. I got up to use the bathroom, a ways down the road. It was finally silent. I looked up at the stars for a full 5 minutes and enjoyed the universe. Back to bed. I woke up at 5 after finally falling into deep sleep. Then the birds started up. In the forest, there's a lot of them. Note to self- take earplugs. At 6 a.m. I gave up and got up. This was NOT in the plan on V-A-C-A-T-I-O-N. Note to self- take sleep aid next time, skip the earplugs. I went down to the bathroom area and got cleaned up. Went back and started a fire. Dave got up about then kid a bit later. Had a nice breakfast, packed the camp up and drove to McCall a few minutes away. It's a gorgeous mountain town, just stunning. Had lunch there, slept a bit on the drive home, then came back to 102 degree heat, ugh. I cooled down the chickens, watered the garden while Dave unloaded. Then- I went to bed, and slept for 2 hours. Dave did too, since he didn't wake me up on time. I got some dinner out as I was really groggy, brought it home, then had a nice evening. I slept for 10 hours, hard. I spent the last 2 days doing laundry and dishes from camping, but I do have a dishwasher thankfully. So much \"clean up\" after- I wanted to go camping why? We do want to go out in the Fall when there's less campers, in a more remote area. Note to self- camping is actually a blast- take sleep aid.

{"title": "Garden Thrifting, Independence Days, Homemade Laundry Soap Results", "date": "Jul 19, 2012", "text": "Amen RalphGarden Thrifting-It was HOT today, 102. Ugh. I had errands to run and decided to call a local feed store that has a nice garden area. I knew their veggies were probably on sale, if they had any left, and they did! 75% off! I picked up 2 BIG paste tomatoes, 2 tarragons, and 3 perennials. What a deal! I love tarragon in chicken salad. I also got some row cover on sale for next spring for the raised bed to help with starting seeds early. Their fruit trees were 1/2 off and I'm eyeing a pear tree :)  Need to find a spot though... Dave loves pears!Out tonite Dave and I passed a junked fence pile. When I spotted the \"free\" sign I asked Dave to go back fast! :)  We got enough decent cedar fence boards to make a needed gate behind the coop. There's a 3' - 4' gap between the back of the coop and the main fence. We have plastic garden fencing in the gap, but it's a pain climbing over it. We can make a nice little gate there now, all free! I'll post pics.Independence Days-1. Plant Something- Bought the tomatoes and herbs, will plant shortly. Still thinking about a pear tree :)2. Harvest Something- Eggs, compost, a few berries and a tomato for tomorrow night, our first! About another week for the blackberry deluge! Peppers are almost ripe.3. Preserve/Store Something- Last week canned dill pickles, pickled green beans (they're wonderful!) and peach jam. I'm freezing more rhubarb in a few days from our neighbor, it's almost ripe. Will freeze berries soon. Next week will make my home-grown organic choke cherry jelly. Re-organizing the pantry, for better use of space. Got some Costco rosemary bread in the freezer.4. Manage Reserves- Get A Good Deal/Barter/Stock Up/Prep- Bought some basics at Costco today- 20 lbs. sugar, 25 lbs. flour, 20 lbs. rolled oats, canned white chicken, canned smoked pork (sounds like a good dinner on buns with homemade spicy barbecue sauce!), a big bag wild black rice (only $5.00!), cat food, HUGE bag organic tortilla chips, and potato chips. After reading more about the drought nationally, etc., I' m getting more basics for everyday storage. I'm buying a bunch of chicken parts to freeze for the next several months. They're pretty cheap this time of year. Will check out the various peppers too.5. Eat the Food- Try New Foods/Recipes- Made some homemade pizza with dough from the local pizza place, covered with my home grown basil, it was to die for!!! Bought some wild black rice at Costco, turns purple when cooked. Used leftover pasta sauce on leftover french bread for pizzas. I really use up my leftovers better now that I'm home and am more focused.6. Build Community Food Systems- Talked to neighbor about getting more rhubarb next week, will give her some of my tomatoes when they ripen :)  Will hit a farmer's market next week. I want to can some pepper relish.7. Recycle/Re-Use- Picked up wood mentioned above. I'm still deep cleaning our closets, and the garage. Sorting camping stuff in the shed. We' going camping for the first time in years! Since we have too much, we're giving the extras to our one daughter who also camps. She's going with us this weekend, I'm excited!  I have 4 items for sale on eBay- 3 purses and a blouse. Will use the funds for other projects. Thrifting I got a like-new blouse for work (Ralph Lauren), and a scarf for winter. I found a place to get free crate wood (very clean) to build a canning cabinet. That will be my next big project with Dave. I'll post pics.8. Skill Up- Learning more new recipes for canning, quite a variety out there! I'm printing out quite a few for future use. 9. Regenerate What is Lost/Salvage Something- Garden fencing project, and crate wood for cabinet.Not to confuse anyone, but I combined #3 and #4 (store and preserve) since that worked better for me.Homemade Laundry Soap Results-I posted my recipe recently and tried it after letting it sit a couple of days. I shook it several times a day as well. Clothes seem clean, soft, no odor! So far, so good! We do have hard water here, so that's a concern. A little blob of soap is there still. Next time I will use more boiling water to mix the shredded soap. I saw a big container of soap at Costco- $14.00 almost choked, then laughed!  National Droughts & The Future, Rising Corn Prices & Your Grocery Bill-If you've followed the national news much (and you read between the lines) things could get pretty ugly at the grocery store soon. With the \"worst drought in a generation\" happening, affecting many crops and livestock, it's good to do what we can now to prepare for some certain upcoming changes. I read these two articles with some very sobering statistics- Worst Drought In A Generation  Rising Corn Prices & Grocery BillThose of us in the city (or in the country) who shop at a grocery stores on a regular basis tend to get lazy and complacent about shopping- the food will always be there, prices always about the same. I have peanut butter in my pantry I bought last year for $5.00 for a large jar. It's now $8.00+. Milk is up, grain is up. We tend not to notice the subtle, gradual changes right away. It tends to be cumulative. \"Wait a minute, that was $... a few months ago\". So what can we do? Think ahead. This brings back thoughts about my Spring Food Preservation class I took. Ask yourself some questions when thinking about stocking your pantry (or talk to a friend who could use some info). If you don't have one now, start one. If you have one- good for you!!! Some dry goods can be stored in the garage- dried beans, paper products, things that aren't heat/freeze sensitive, in rodent-proof containers. The rest should be inside in a cool, dry area. Carve out an area somewhere. If you don't think you have room now think- how will you feed yourself later? Turn your linen closet into a food storage area, and store your linens somewhere else, like the garage (in a nice tote!). Buy an inexpensive food dehydrator, or build one. Start canning. Start stockpiling basics- grains, nuts, seeds, flours, salt, fats/oils, sugars, sweeteners, canned/dried fruits, veggies, dairy. Think about- what you would need if you couldn't go to the store for 2 weeks? What if 1 weeks food supply suddenly cost the same as 2 weeks food supply? What would you do? What would you do if you wanted to help other family members, friends, neighbors, co-workers? What would you be willing to give up NOW to get serious? I'm getting serious. I'm so glad we bought our small chest freezer. I'm saving a lot of $$$ that way. Right now split chickens are 99 cents a pound and that always ends around the end of summer. It's freezing time baby!!!Here's an estimate of what 4 people would use food-wise for 2 weeks:- 85 Gallons of Water- 2 weeks of medications- About 25lbs of grains/or equivalent calorie dense root vegetables- 10lbs of beans or other legumes- 3 lbs of sweetener- 12 cans of fish or meat- 5 lbs dry milk- 12 cans of vegetables- 2 lbs dried fruit- 1 quart of oil- Some Treats- Just under 50 multivitamins- Salt, baking soda, vinegar, baking powder, yeast, spicesEstimated Cost,  at the grocery store, depending on where you live (excluding Medications): $158.96Estimated Cost, bought/ordered in bulk (plus extras): $ 103.50Food Storage Questions to Ask Yourself- What am I storing food for?  What are my concerns?  What kinds of situations are likely in my region? How much food do I want to store?  For how many people/pets?  Don't forget your chickens! :)How much water do I want to store?  Am I likely to have people outside my immediate household who are with us in a crisis?  Are there other things I want to store – clothing, medical supplies, tools?  What are they? How much time and energy do I have to devote to this?  How much space do I realistically think I have to devote to this? How much money can I spend each week/month on this project?Where will my stored food come from?  How much of it will I grow/produce?  What are my goals for food preservation?  How much of my food will I buy, and from where?  What can I get locally, and what do I have to get through the industrial food system?  What’s the best and most ethical source for my food?  What do I imagine doing with my food storage? Do I want it mostly to provide a hedge against a crisis, or for day to day use?  Do I imagine myself eating regularly out of it and replacing it?  Do I want to be able to share with others, or is my first priority protecting my own?  How will I prevent loss of food to age, insects, mold?Very thought-provoking, and better to answer now, than later. Breathe, don't panic and think ahead. It's much easier to be sane and smart when you have the time to go thru the process...               You can find out ways to support your local farmers with local groups or agencies, or go to FarmAid.org  Farm Aid Store They have some fun gear for sale to support their work. If you know of any other groups please let me know? I'm ordering these two items to help out. I'd go to a concert if I lived in the area..."},
{"title": "My Poor Cukes & Garden Update, HBO's \"Newsroom\" Intro, Money Tips Learned", "date": "Jul 18, 2012", "text": "I had great cukes, both lemon and pickling. I went out this week and all the leaves were gone! I know it wasn't the chickens as I had the same problem last year, outside the chicken area. I don't know if it's squirrels, bugs or what. The blossom are still set, so I'm leaving them and hoping for fruit... this stinks...Tomatoes are doing great! Nice, big and healthy-Blackberries are starting to turn black, but still tart, another week or so! Then it'll be baking, freezing and canning time!!! Yum!Beans, Great Lakes and Italian, by the side of the house. Still small, but here's hoping!Various flowers around the back yard-Bamboo by the pond- HBO's \"Newsroom\" Intro-We have Dish Network and subscribe to HBO since we don't go out much. I know, I'm bad watching TV, but I'm very selective, so I don't watch that much. I was waiting for the new show Newsroom to start since it had a great cast, timely topics and Aaron Sorkin produced it. This opening scene sets the tone for the show- a fed up newsman (think likable & don't-rock-the-boat) finally gets honest about his view of America. Warning- there's some R rated language, so no young ears please. Watch til the very end :) Money Planning Tips-We recently did some retirement/financial planning, so here's a few ideas I thought I'd share-*We pay our mortgage every 2 weeks, which adds quite a bit to paying it off early. *We refinanced our 3 year old car and saved 3 pts. We'll pay it off a year earlier.*We eliminated most of our remaining credit card debt the last few years. We put the balance recently on a low interest signature loan thru a credit union, so we're almost done there!*DO NOT start a college fund, if you have kids, plan your savings and retirement funds FIRST. We helped 3 kinds thru college and only took out 1 small loan, and co-signed 2 other small loans. Kids should use student grants & loans FIRST. If they are responsible for their own education if makes them much more invested (excuse the pun) in doing well, keeping their grades up and finishing. If you put them thru college and it breaks your bank, where does that leave you? Not in a good place. And teach them (if you haven't already) how to create a good credit history. Our kids took a basic \"how to use a checking account\" class in high school. WE sat them down and taught them about establishing credit, and to get 1 credit card for emergency use, and keep it paid off. They had a few bumps, but in their mid 20's they all have good credit! Can't buy a home with it...*Save, save, save. We had 2 hospitalizations, one emergency, and one for hubby's shoulder surgery. The costs were really tough. If we'd had more savings, it would have really taken the mental load off us. I'm grateful we HAD savings, small as it is.*I buy most of my household goods/clothes, etc. used, and we don't live the same urban life as most BUT we're happier and don't have the $$$ worries of most either :)  *I feel so bad for the rural areas, including  in my state, in drought and with fires. I also worry about what this will mean for US in terms of coming food prices? We don't eat beef much, but what about grains, beans, etc? I'm stocking up and canning more this summer. We all do what we can, while we can... ﻿ Anya sleeping next to me while I read on the computer. She has to be where I am. We've bonded :)        Don't tell anyone- I'm plowing my way thru all 3 seasons of Roswell this summer (free from the local Library) since I missed most of it back in 1999-2001 when it was on. It's my guilty pleasure!"},
{"title": "1932 Long’s Peak Orange Pie Recipe", "date": "Jul 16, 2012", "text": "1932 Long’s Peak Orange Pie Recipe-I found this in my cookbook “The Lost Art of Pie Making Made Easy” by Barbara Swell. I was in the mood for something orangey tonite, so I made it! I love the book as it has so many OLD recipes and great stories...Ingredients-       1 baked 8″ pie shell3 egg yolks1/2 cup granulated sugar 4 tablespoons of flour1 cup fresh orange juice (I used frozen)2 teaspoons finely grated orange zest3 tablespoons lemon juice2 teaspoons finely grated lemon zestpinch of salt2 tablespoons of butter1/2 teaspoon pure orange extract (my addition)Beat the yolks with the sugar til creamy. Add the flour, orange and lemon juice, zests, and salt. Cook in a double boiler until thickened (about 20 minutes) whisking constantly. I used a small pot and it worked fine, as I don't own a double boiler and can cook :) Once thick, take off the heat and add the butter, whisking it in. Pour into a baked shell and cover with meringue:3 egg whites room temp3 tablespoons of sugarBeat room temperature egg whites with an electric mixer til fluffy, then slowly add the sugar. Beat the whites until stiff, where they can hold a peak. Spread the meringue all around the top of the pie and seal it, as it helps the meringue not weep. Put pie in the center of a preheated oven at 350F for about 15 minutes until golden brown. Chill before serving!!! This was my first attempt at a meringue-topped pie and it came out great! Dave and I each had two slices:) It was thin, so next time I might double the filling and meringue. Enjoy!More Canning Yesterday- I use the recipes I posted a couple of days ago, and did the pickled dilly beans first-It was nice yesterday morning as it rained really hard for at least 15 minutes the night before. I went to bed to the sound of pouring rain, what a nice sound.... I used the steam canner for the beans. I usedthe inversion method for the jam- cooked/boiled, then poured into hot jars, inverted for 5 minutes, and pinged a little later! I've read only to use this for jams/jellies. The jam was something new so I had to use the \"sheeting test\" for it. It took an extra 10 minutes more to \"sheet\", but it jelled!  I had a 1/2 pint leftover of the spiced version, so it went into the fridge and had some on toast this morning. It was good, so I'm happy! I was afraid I'd have peach syrup! Here's the peaches cooking down, with a blob of butter to prevent foaming-I saw that my chokecherry bush I planted has a good crop ripening, so I'm going to try making some jelly from that soon...Yesterday my canning total was- 4 qts. and 5 pints of dilly beans, 1/2 were \"spicy\"1 qt. dilly carrots and beans- spicy7 1/2 pints peach jam, with 1/2 of the jam \"spiced\" with a little vanilla and cinnamon. I cut the sugar 1/3 in the recipe,a little too sweet IMO, but not bad for a first go at it.Homemade Laundry Soap-I made my first batch of Tinygardener's Laundry Soap recipe. Talk about easy, it took me 5minutes tops! I had read that Zote and Fels Naptha soaps have a lot of toxic chemicals. I liked this recipe because it used coconut-based Castile soap. The supplies were pretty cheap at the grocery store too, maybe $8.00. That price included 3 bars of soap, so it would make about 6 gallons of laundry soap, with some powders leftover. I cut the recipe in 1/2 since there's only two of us, and we use a front load washer, which uses less soap...First I grated the castile soap-Then I mixed some boiling water to the soap to \"melt\" it, then put cold water in a 1 gallon recycled vinegar jug. I then added the hot mix, added the borax and washing soda. Shake, shake, all done! ﻿All done...Rain's Coming!-I think we're going to get some more rain soon! We get these late afternoon thunderstorms, but sometimes, no actual rain on the ground. I hate those storms, ick! I've learned to read the read fairly accurately after living here a while, and I can see these storms also \"split\" and miss us completely. They go left and right, and zippo down the middle to Boise. it's just the topography of the place. At least I did a bunch of front yard work a bit ago- weeding, pruning, dead heading and general clean up, since it was a bit cooler and windy. Then I got hot fast, as I didn't realize it was 90, so I came in. All done and it looks much better out there! And now it's getting cooler, rain's coming!"},
{"title": "Canning Today & Tomorrow, Tour of My Pantry, Nature Always Finds a Way", "date": "Jul 14, 2012", "text": "Canning Today & Tomorrow-I jumped into canning today! After searching all over for some decent pickling cukes, and finding some, I chose to do my pickles today. Got a nice, fresh batch, about 8 lbs. Since it was almost 20 degrees cooler today (about 80 when I started) and cloudy, it was great! I do stream canning (only for high acid foods, so please no comments) outside, since my glass-topped range can't handle the long term heating of other methods. It's a good compromise for me. While I have a small dehydrator and chest freezer, I also like canning. I started for the first time last summer, and feel much more comfortable this year.                                                   Last year I did pickles, home-grown organic applesauce and apple butter. I LOVE the steam canner since I can use it outside and minimize the heat in the kitchen. While it's still hot in the kitchen from boiling jars, brine, rings and lids, at least the actual canning is outside. I did a lot of research before I bought a steam canner, and man that stuff is BOILING when you bring it out! I follow the directions very meticulously on the timing, etc. I used a basic Ball Blue Book recipe for dill pickles. I did some with slices of jalapeno (no seeds) for a little hotter pickle, and some \"kosher style\" with bay leaf & garlic. Last year I used 50% more pickling spices and everybody RAVED about the flavor. I used a little home grown dill and some mustard flowers. I use our propane camping stove on our glass patio table.Once the steam comes out of the little hole in a steady stream then you start the timing. I use the same basic canning times on all recipes. Coordinated timing is the big thing- have the canner ready so the brine goes on the cukes, lids on, and into the canner fast. All done! Today I did 8 qts. and 2 pints. I used all the cukes, and was done in about 1 1/2 hours. It always takes longer to set up, make the brine, clean the cukes, clean up, etc. than the actual canning does. I might do more, maybe some sweet ones next time...Tomorrow canning will be- Pickled Green Beans and Peach Jam (I'll use less sugar). I found the beans at the regular grocery store (no local yet) and the peaches at a farmy-type stand. I got 10 lbs. of peaches (from Cali. but fairly ripe). I have no idea why pickled green beans are $7.00 a jar?  Really? That's insane, so I'm making my own! My canning goals this year -peach and blackberry (homegrown) jams, tomatoes (home grown). Whatever apples and nectarines we get from our trees I will use for something. I finished some salsa while the canner ran. I used local tomatoes, purple onion, jalapeno, salt, and wine vinegar yesterday. I didn't have any cilantro, so got some today with the beans and tossed it in!The basil's is getting BIG! I started these babies from seed, inside, this spring. I smell pesto soon...Tour of My Pantry-Last year Dave and I converted a bedroom closet (took about an hour) to a pantry, and what a good idea! Here's a little tour to inspire anyone out there that, yes, you can find some space somewhere! I try to keep a good variety of proteins (beans and fish), condiments, veggies, fruits, drinks, sweeteners, baking supplies, grains and paper products. I keep things like bottled water, instant foods, and Pilot Bread for real emergencies. Pilot Bread can be used in place of bread for sandwiches, of sorts. The pickles are in, and I made space for the next jars coming in the next few weeks-Nature Always Finds a Way- I had pruned our front sumac tree from storm damage last month. I had to choose to have a bare 3' branch in the front/middle (and hope it grew back), OR I could cut it off completely and have one sad looking tree. Being an optimist, I left the 3' branch. A month later it's all filled in!!! Nature finds a way :) I actually have to do a strategic pruning job to have it look good later. Ironic huh? :)  I'm a Master Gardener, so that training comes in handy! We're getting ready for camping soon, and we haven't gone in over 5 years. I need some time off!Anya playing with a paper bag, again:)"},
{"title": "WWII Food & Fuel Posters, Garden, Heat & Canning", "date": "Jul 13, 2012", "text": "WWII Food & Fuel PostersI found this education article fascinating! I never knew that clothing was also rationed-'WWII Propaganda Posters Urging Conservation, Limitation, and Rationing by Americans on the home front to support the war effort: The United States did not suffer the same kinds of war deprivations that Europe did, although there were wartime shortages. During World War II it became necessary for the U.S. government to ration some foods, rubber, gas, and even clothing. Americans were asked to limit and conserve on many niceties and necessities.Wartime travel, materials and commodities conservation and rationing meant participation and sacrifices by all. Their efforts included scrap drives, taking factory jobs, goods donations and other similar projects to assist the troops on the front lines. Government-sponsored ads, radio shows, posters and pamphlet campaigns urged the American people to comply. With a sense of urgency, the campaigns appealed to America to contribute by whatever means they had, without complaint. These methods were a highly effective and one can gain a better understanding and imagine how and why they worked so well by viewing the historic conservation and rationing posters like this one displayed on this web page; this vintage poster sends a strong effective message.' From Crazywebsite.com Free Galleries  Tons of posters to check out- Vintage World War 2 PostersGarden, Heat & Canning-With the heat (105 yesterday) it's been WATER, WATER, WATER, and keep the chickens cool. The tomatoes are growing really fast, and I'm seeing them starting to change color! I trimming off the excess vines, to keep the fruit up. Tomatoes won't set fruit above about 90 degrees from what I've read, so I'm stuck there, but there's lots of blossom already. The blackberries are starting to ripen, scored 2 yesterday, and we should have a huge harvest! I'm having trouble finding pickling cukes locally- I found some a week ago, went back later and they were bad, ew. Another store said they wouldn't carry them as 2 shipments in a row were BAD there. So today I'm going to try a 3rd store to see if I can find any. I could kick myself for not buying the first batch when they were fresh off the truck. Lesson learned!!! You have to get what you can when you can. I'm growing pickling cukes myself, but I only planted 3 so not sure if there'll be enough for what I want to do quantity-wise. I found some wonderful peaches that are actually ripe (no local yet) from California, so I may try to make a small batch of jam, we'll see. I need to harvest the last of my neighbors rhubarb, so will do that soon, and freeze it. I may can some rhubarb sauce for hubby, as he loves it! ﻿"},

Looks like new and Dave installed it already!From vintage kitchen kettle to cat food container!Independence Days- In the last couple of weeks since I last posted here's the run down:1. Plant Something- Green beans by the side of the house, coming up nicely! Planting season is pretty much over2. Harvest Something- Raspberries, Western Service berries, rhubarb from the neighbor again, chives, rosemary, dill, eggs, compost.3. Preserve Something- Froze fish, butter, cheese, bacon, and made rhubarb sauce. Will make another batch in a few days. Getting ready to start canning pickles, as cukes are in the stores. No locals ready yet... 4. Store Something- Working on freezer and pantry mostly.5. Manage Reserves- Get A Good Deal/Barter/Stock Up/Prep- Bought extra items for freezer.6. Eat the Food- Try New Foods/Recipes- Using more low cost chicken parts to roast since it's always cheap this time of year, barbecue season. Made new potato salad, everyone loved it.7. Build Community Food Systems- Went to 3 farmers markets yesterday, got corn, cherries, and mustard. No pickling cukes, will have to get those at the grocery store.8. Recycle/Re-Use- Fixed up light fixture, moving items around the house, kitchen kettle for cat food container, using up leftover paints for various projects, sending things out for donations so to not get too much \"stuff\" and clutter. It's easy to but too many fun things and get the junky, over decorated look. I don't like being a pack rat!9. Skill Up- FINALLY- I found a local homesteading group!!! I'm going to take free classes on building a smoker and making fermented veggies. I can't wait!!! I'll post some info after I take them, in the next couple of months.10. Regenerate What is Lost/Salvage Something- Light fixture, fixing lots of stuff around the house, painting, need to re-seed part of back turf.Cooling Mist For Chickens-We had to replace our broken mister from last year that we use to help cool the hens. Since it's hot and dry here it really seems to help in the garden and next to the coop. It uses very little water and can drop the temp about 10 degrees. Just screw onto your hose, turn on a little, and it's instant mist! Since the girls like to be in the shade of the berries I attached it to the fence right above there. Here's pictures of ours, cost about $8.00 at Home Depot-Girls chilling in the shadeAnya chilling inside, she loves her little bed!"},

Technology, Dehumanization and Homesteading & My Blog Award!", "date": "Jul 8, 2012", "text": "It's HOT!!!This photo was from yesterday, in the shade, on the north side of the house. Ugh. We were out running errands, and I was really tired from being in and out of the heat. I drank lots of water, went to bed early and today will be staying in. Giving the garden and chickens lots of extra TLC...Technology, Dehumanization and Homesteading-I read an article and loved this section, it reminds me to be more thoughtful about the choices I make:1. Whenever technology does not humanize it dehumanizes (diminishes man). 2. Whatever diminishes man diminishes his capacity to receive God. 3. Therefore bad technology is spiritually alienating and destructive to the soul. It should be evident that in many instances the conclusion drawn about a particular piece of technology will depend upon many factors besides the piece of technology itself. Thus, in spite of my latent Luddism, I have been convinced by experience that in general, while not great technology (it is noisy, undependable, and pollutes) the chainsaw is a defensible tool. To saw a winter's worth of wood by hand takes an ungodly long time and a huge output of energy, but with a chainsaw it is a couple of days labor (depending on the latitude). It seems the time and energy saved make it worth enduring the noise and smell. But this is not absolute: if the time saved is spent building, planting, praying, playing with kids or some other holy endeavor it is a worthwhile exchange. If it's spent watching TV one would be better off sweating over the woodpile. Other technologies may seem more black and white. An electric knife or can opener, for example, seems to be about as senseless a piece of gadgetry as can be conceived, except for the arthritic or handicapped. And some folks, I am told, regularly drive to spas where they then pay money to walk on treadmills.

From their web site, describing the contributors- These people came from a wide range of backgrounds and experience, and included organic farmers, artists, homeschooling mothers, human rights activists, professors, computer professionals, Luddites, friars working in the inner city, and families living in the backwoods.While I'm not religious I \"get it\", from a spiritual perspective. I will peruse their database when I have more time. caelum et terra loosely translated means \"heaven to earth\"...       My Blog Award!-A big thank you to Ashlee at Tinygardener for the new One Lovely Blog Award!

{"title": "Bike Trip, Garden Progress, Heat & All Those Little Things To Do List", "date": "Jul 5, 2012", "text": "Bike Trip-We went on a 10 mile bike ride yesterday morning when it was still cool! We went along the \"green belt\", a long paved bike trial that runs all the way through parts of Boise. We drove out towards the edge of town, parked the car, and rode about 10 miles to a small state park by the Boise river. Yes, I get the irony- driving the car to go for a bike ride, but we live on the other end of the city, and couldn't ride THAT far. It's so nice to not have to worry about being run over by cars on the green belt! Then we had pizza after our ride, an unexpected, last minute decision. Dave and I went buy a wood-fired pizza oven place and dashed in. Good idea. Man, my rear end is sore though, I needed to replace my old bike seat. Dave swapped mine with his, since his was more of a touring seat that came with his used bike he bought recently. I think that will fix things. I could have ridden a lot farther, except for the pain! If you don't know what I'm talking about, never mind.... Little dam near the parkTook our rest break here, the 1/2 point, nice little state park near Lucky Peak Dam-Garden Progress- Pretty good so far, considering how late I planted! Lots of : tomatoes, about 6 varieties! Ready to harvest in a week or so4 kinds of peppers eggplants lemon cukes, finally!cabbagesTons of basil in pots, that I grew from seed. Ready in another week or so.Collard greens are ready to harvestApples and Nectarines are coming along, at least the city didn't kill my nectarine tree! They sprayed our easement with weed killer and my nectarine tree started to turn brown on the lower branches. I watered really heavily for a couple of week to flush out the toxins. Not sure yet if we'll eat the fruit :(Molly on patrol- The chickens are doing a great job with weed and bug control again! They also bask in the sun on a cool morning, my growing New Hampshire's. I wasn't sure what breed they were until they were bigger. The feed store goofed up, but that's okay, I just can't tell them apart! Great dispositions, both of them, and should be laying in another month or so...my nasturtiums Heat- We've been in the 80's and 90's, and supposed to start hitting the 100's by this weekend. At this point I just wish we'd get some rain! I try to water as much as needed, and we mulch heavily. I know I'm lucky we have city water available compared to people who rely strictly on the rain. There's a cost to that too, so I try to really conserve water as much as we can. We live in a desert basically. I grew up in southern California, where most of the water comes from other states, still. I don't think most people there realize how vulnerable they are, as far as long-term shortages that already looming (that's another, much longer story....).  I do use our rain barrels too, but we need rain to keep them filled! I thought about laying straw in the veggie garden, but the girls would just make a mess. Our composting is coming along, so we'll add more soon. I try to do outdoor stuff with the weather, like tying up my tomatoes at 10 p.m. the other night! It was cooler and I could still see :) I should mow this morning while it's cool, but I'm too stiff from my bike ride. I sure used other muscles yesterday- upper back is pretty stiff. Time to stretch!  All Those Little Things To Do List-With the summer off work I try to do a lot of projects around here. One summer we replaced our cedar fencing around the house, since the one one was rotted. Dave and I set the posts and stringers, then I screwed in every board in 100 degree heat. I really LOVE my fence! I usually deep clean the house, and there are repairs, etc. I've done much better this year starting the projects early and then I won't feel like a failure come back-to-work time. I know what a luxury it is too. I've been able to do more crafts this year than usual, mostly because of all the inspiration I see reading other blogs! I really want to start canning, but it's a little early for my garden foods. We're going to go to a farmers market Sat. to see what's available. I'd like to get a jump on it and start NOW! My empty jars from last year are crying! And I have the time. Last year I made a mad rush with the apples ripening right as I went back to work, of course :)"},

I used white interior house paint, crafts paint, scrap 2 x 4's, & burlap I already had. I think it's pretty cute!Ugly Shelf Makeover-I had seen some display shelves installed over doors, on other blogs. Since I have a small kitchen and have some vintage items now, I thought I'd try that for some extra space. Dave and I hit a thrift store today where I had seen lots of these kinds of shelves pretty cheap last week. We measured our door before and I took a tape measure. We got the ugly brown one today for $3.00, half price, and it fits perfectly! :) It would have been a lot more expensive to buy the new components at a big box store. I have one door going into the living room that had 3 ceramic trivets (made by my kids) over it. So I took them down (for another place), touched up the paint, and now it's a nice clean canvas, so to speak-                                     Several coats of white interior paint (that I already had) later-As it's still drying, I will post the \"after\" photo when I get it up and the vintage kitchen items are on it. Speaking of which.... Vintage Finds-Dave spotted a small yard sale yesterday morning when he was out and called me. He was trying to describe a kerosene heater/lamp, and I couldn't quite \"get it\" over the phone, so we went down together. There were some really old vintage items from the 1900's -1920's. I spent a whopping $4.00! Here's my haul-A large biscuit cutter- 4\" across that I'll actually use that for those special \"I need a GIANT biscuit\" times A \"mixer\" for pancake batters, etc. I'd never seen one like this before-A meat grinder, that works, with all the original blades. I've been wanting to start grinding my own meat after the \"pink slime\" fiasco. Plus who want to eat ground up cartilage, fat, and god-knows-what else??? I'm trying to lose weight and eat more whole foods. Those don't qualify :) She had a whole table full of these for $3.00 each!Dave just had to have this, it was just like his Mom's, it was 5 cents, what a deal! The original price was still stamped on it- 59 cents.In a junk store, out of town, I found these, $2.00 each. The green candles match my vintage stuff! They're about 7\" high, nice and small.Sewing-I spent a half day this last week re-fitting many of my older tops down to fit the slimmer me now. This was the before of my spare bedroom-It looked like a clothing explosion, but everything fits now! I'm so glad I bought my new sewing machine last year. It's really paid for itself! Now I can walk across the room and set up the total gym (sitting off to the left), and and start working out :)I've linked this post with the Barn Hop﻿"},

Years ago I read about all the microscopic bugs and larvae that are in packaged store-bought grains, that you can't actually see.  It's gross, I know. There's nothing more frustrating than going to bake and pulling out a bag of flour and finding it full of weevils. EW! I got into the habit of sticking anything I buy grain-wise into the freezer for several days as soon as I got it home from the store. Kills any tiny stuff in there. The freezer method has worked great for me for years, so I'll stick with what I do. I always take the grains, like whole oats, cornmeal, flours, out of the original containers right away, and then freeze them. After freezing I put them either in glass jars, or Rubbermaid-type containers with a good sealing snap-on lid. I was reading about oven canning grains, but I don't have enough room for all those jars. Here's an article with some more tips and ideas on storage- Get Rid of WeevilsGreat Western Movie Hats- Ever since I saw the original True Grit movie, I wanted a cool western/prairie hat. Not the fabric kind with bows, but a working ranch/farm woman's hat! I stumbled onto this article and swooned when I saw the new True Grit hat- I want one!!! It's made by Stetson- The Austral.

Great Idea! Now if I only had a vintage shredder! Independence Days- 1. Plant Something- Two new kinds of green beans, one Italian, by the side of the house. Hopefully no chicken damage! Also Calendula and California Poppies in my hot, sunny patch in the front yard. Calendula can make a good tincture for sore muscles! And they re-seed every year.2. Harvest Something- Eggs, chives, Raspberries and Western Serviceberries (I need to post a photo). They're native to Idaho and are similar to blueberries. Yummy! Tomatoes soon and blackberries. The greens in the raised bed are almost ready, lettuce in the cold frame is sos-l-o-w...3. Preserve Something- Froze several lbs. of rhubarb from my neighbor. Yeah, that's awesome! 4. Store Something- More bread in freezer, cheeses from the grocery outlet (what a deal!), staying on top of the pantry.5. Manage Reserves- Get A Good Deal/Barter/Stock Up/Prep- More grocery outlet stuff, crafting supplies. I got a few birthday items for someone soon:)6. Eat the Food- Try New Foods/Recipes- Using our berries in desserts. Going thru my cookbooks again. Doing more scratch cooking/baking now that I'm home.7. Build Community Food Systems- Harvested more rhubarb.8. Recycle/Re-Use- Composting, Dave's bringing more free scrap lumber home. Will use some for crafts or building projects. Got out old craft paints and using up what's leftover. Touching up with spackle and paint inside the house, mostly worn areas. Next summer I'll paint the whole kitchen!9. Skill Up- Getting better at crafts, will get into more needlework and crocheting soon.10. Regenerate What is Lost/Salvage Something- Repainted exterior parts of house, coop and fencing to preserve wood. Tomorrow is sewing day, since I have a big pile to alter.

{"title": "Homesteading- Health, Debt and The Long Haul", "date": "Jun 26, 2012", "text": "Health- You have to love health insurance, if you have it. It sure beats the alternative! I recently had an eye exam, and am getting new sunglasses. Total (with inner eye photo extra)- $79.00, and that's with no-line bifocals. I pay $7.00 a month for the vision coverage. It pays for itself yearly. Ditto my \"free\" dental coverage- my checkup is in a week, never any charge, even if they have work to do. I broke off part of a front tooth a few years back- repaired, and tweaked twice, no charge. I have been losing weight, with my free visits to the dietitian, thru our employee assistance program, also free to me. The weight loss, I want to clarify, was not to look better and fit into some \"attractive\" perception of society. It was to feel better and protect my long-term health. I think of it as a homesteading act, of sorts. Stronger, leaner, & healthier. I also use my medical insurance wisely and try to avoid meds, and doctor visits when I can. I started using vitamin D several years ago to prevent colds/infections. It's now being touted as possibly helping with allergies, MS, Parkinson's, cancers and a host of other things. It's also a natural anti-depressant. And it's cheap! Who wouldn't want to take this stuff??? I take 2000 IUs a day, and 4-5000 if I feel something coming on. Anyway, protect your health while you can because....                                                                    Debt- Inter/National and Personal-Watch the international news a bit and you hear a lot. Then you need to get out of the \"mainstream\" news, and dig deeper. I've been doing urban homesteading since before it was called that. We've made a lot of changes over the last several years, in terms of frugality, paying off debt, and starting a serious pantry. We also started really prioritizing our home improvements, etc. While I would love to move to a more rural area, we are here right now, so that's the way it is. Dave won't consider moving, so... I do what I can here.I think we're in for some kind of crash, again, maybe in banking, big pharma, and/or the continued de-valuation of the U.S. dollar. China has been dumping millions of U.S. currency and I don't think they're done. It may get ugly too, as many are \"sheeple\" and never look at the bigger picture. Many just get caught up in their own little personal sphere and never look up and out. That's ok, if you want to play the game that way. The PTB (powers that be), and I don't mean the political parties or their reps (that's another much longer post), sit back and move the pieces on the board at specific times. There is never any randomness to it. It just seems that way at the time. That's my opinion.                   The Long Haul- I don't have a picture in my head of what that will look like, at least in the U.S. I do see this however- more massive weather-related damage, more fires, more floods. And people won't learn- \"let's just rebuild, sure it's a hurricane area, but FEMA will bail us out.\" Good luck. People will continue to rack up massive debt in their quest to impress others, and bolster their self esteem- \"sure let's get an iPad, but how will I pay for...\" The newest clothes, toys, gadgets, and cars. Buy the 8 year old a cell phone, sure, why not? Give someone a pet they can't afford, because you love them. Great idea. Overbuy your home, and don't downsize when you should. Kids have moved out- of course you need that 5 bedroom house for their once a year visit :)  Play it that way, for now.                        I think we all need to learn as much as we can, try to help those who want to change, and let go of those who won't. Those may even be family members. Tough decisions, and you can't make people change. They have to want to, and some have to reach the BOTTOM before they will. In addiction, there's the \"moment of clarity\"- this doesn't work anymore, I'm done. No more excuses, I'm through. As a society, and part of the planetary system (eco and otherwise), we may have to reach the bottom before we can wake up, and start over...                Please no wild comments, this is just my view. I will answer any questions that I can..."},
{"title": "Spicy Fried (Not Greasy!) Chicken Recipe, Keeping Your Flock Cool, Vintage Brooder Heater", "date": "Jun 26, 2012", "text": "Amazing Spicy Fried (Not Greasy!) Chicken Recipe- I found this book years ago at a discount store, what a find! Then I made the Southern-Exposed Fried Chicken recipe. OMG! I loved it, kids loved it, everybody loved it! It's the seasoning, and the soaking in buttermilk that does it. You fry it, then finish it off on the oven. When I was in my 20's I traveled thru the South briefly and had hot, spicy fried chicken. Nothing like the bland stuff I was used to. Trust me you'll love it, if not, hey someone will! I couldn't find this online, so I scanned the recipe-                                           You can vary it with the heat- I add a little more cayenne, and thyme- about 2 teaspoons. He has other great recipes, and the book can be found (used) pretty cheap online. I love his smothered chicken too! I serve with either homemade slaw/salad, and cornbread/biscuits, iced tea (sweet if you like), and you're all set! We have some fruit clafouti (like a cobbler with a yogurt batter) leftover for dessert. Ah, the good life... Another recipe- I found this on Kat's blog- Cake in A Cup What a great idea! Sometimes you just need a quick fix, and a whole cake is too much for 2 sometimes. In the heat of summer a quick microwave and bam- it's dessert! I may try something like vanilla for the berries we have ripening. I can't wait til the blackberries ripen, because we'll have another huge crop this summer! Just a few raspberries now...Keeping Your Flock Cool in The Heat- When I started thinking about starting an urban flock one of the big considerations was the weather here- very cold in the winter, very hot in the summer. And dry, as we're high desert here, and it's normal to have stretches in the 90's/100's. While the coop has good ventilation, I also bought a ready-to-use misting device (about $6.00 at Home Depot) that has a twisted, flexible section. I just attach it to the hose, turn on and attach it to the fence. It uses very little water. I use it right next to the coop late in the afternoon, and at night. During the day, when they're in their run/garden area, they get crushed ice in an old pie pan several times a day, in the waterer trough, and lots of cold water, in multiple waterers. They also love cold, wet veggies- cukes, especially! I make sure they also have lots of shade, including my new pergola. I water under it every day to keep it damp. I also water the area around the coop for evaporation every day/evening. Here's some other good ideas you could use-  How to Keep Your Flock CoolVintage Brooder Heater-This is a nice kerosene brooder heater, in excellent condition. Has lots of brass detailing, and I got for $10.00 at a yard sale! Works great for extra heat (not in coop) in emergencies. A little step back into the past. I imagine all the little chicks it kept warm :)After checking to see who entered correctly (some of you forgot to add your link back to me), my hubby picked a random letter winner and the winner IS....Susan, at the e-i-e-i-omg blog!

{"title": "Are Some of Us Fruitcakes? Recycled Screen Project, Odds & Ends", "date": "Jun 25, 2012", "text": "﻿Are Some of Us/Homesteaders Viewed as Fruitcakes?- I was thinking the other day about how out-of-step some of us are, compared to modern, \"mainstream\" society, when it comes to living a different kind of life. A more thoughtful life. Some people might think we're a little off upstairs. There are things I do, for instance, that come automatically- turn off the lights when I leave a room, recycle, think of ways to produce and store more foods, look at someones garbage pile :)  Here's a classic example- we were driving past a recycling center this week when I asked Dave to pull a U turn and go back. I told him there was a metal plant stand sticking out of the metal bin. Dave went back, and I got out. It was rusted beyond a simple fix up (I don't weld) so I passed. Now some people might thinks that just low class, low brow weird behavior. Some might think \"whatever\", others \"that's stealing\". Well, technically....Well anyway, watch the Jimmy Buffett video for a good laugh. I might be viewed as weird by some, and I like it that way :)  Recycled Screen Project/Cabinet- This spring I bought an old, vintage screen at a flea market, for $3.00-I knew I could do something with this. I finally settled on asking Dave to build a cedar, \"culled\" wood cabinet of sorts, for our deck. It would add more storage, and get rid of our ugly white plastic shelf  (left over from the first pantry closet attempt)- I thought we could put our various barbecue and gardening stuff in it. It would age nicely, with the cedar top and sides. I asked Dave to leave the back open since it's up against the house, but he had to stabilize it. Since the wood was \"culled\", misshapen, split, etc., it was only about $5.00. Pretty cheap! For this kind of project I just wanted to keep the price down and be creative. This gave me the idea for the \"box\" Pallet Cabinet  Our cedar box became the body-I love the old chippy paint! I'll add a knob soon. Total project cost: about $8.00!!!                                                                                                                                     Head Board House NumberOdds and Ends-I thought this was a great idea!

{"title": "Thrifting, Quilt Pattern? Possessed Cat, Surprise (Don't Tell Anyone!)", "date": "Jun 21, 2012", "text": "Thrifting- I forgot to add the picture above from my last trip. $1.50 and fits in my dining room vintage motif great! I may distress the frame edging, maybe. I also got a new summer purse, quilt, shoes, and small wire hanging display for my vintage kitchen stuff collection. I love my Land's End shoes (durable & comfortable brand), looks like they were never worn, but I'm OCD, so I put in some liners anyway, cool and comfy, and $4.00! I could wear these to work with slacks and who would know ;) Ha ha! People are work would probably be shocked at home many thrift items I wear to work (like I care?). It's \"business casual\"- no jeans, slacks, blouses, sweaters, etc. I always load up during the summer when I have time to really go looking.                         I was wanting a new summer quilt and this jumped out at me today, nice and bright, goes great with the rest of the room. It's like new, but does anyone know what the pattern is called? It's a fuzzy navy on the other side. I washed it and it's on our bed, a little oversized but I like it that way. It almost reminds me of a nautical motif...Possessed Cat- It's all coming back to me now- having a cat. We lost Tinkerbell (no, I didn't name her) several years ago. Anya is our first cat since then. All those odd, funny things that cats are known for, are coming back, like:rolling in catnip, over and over againtaking a bath, then rolling some moredrinking out of non-cat water containers! It is the water pitcher on our dining table from dinner, ew. I'll put out a ceramic bowl tomorrow. I guess she doesn't like plastic! playing inside of, and laying on, paper bagsAh Anya, I remember it all now! Have I only had her for a week today? But she's a great cat, sweet and very affectionate. And look at those eyes :)  She's a keeper...Surprise- Make sure and come back on Sat. I have a BIG surprise. It's a give............."},

I got 2 new pairs of jeans, a expensive chambray blouse, fake flowers, a Swedish bird candelabra (with rosemaling painting), vintage kitchen items and a mini-rake. Total today, $23.00! I wanted to finish up a craft project with my cream re-painted wood container and so I used some of today's mixed items, see above. Close up of the vintagey stuff I got for it-The rolling pin was .50 cents! Flowers .79, mini rake was a buckPastry cutter was a buck :)  Ironically I had just bought a bunch of vintage green kitchen items. Then I spotted the red cutter today and thought it would be nice and bright with the flowers, etc.!I may add something on the front, haven't decided yet. The \"before\" below had been painted dark and had a fall motif. I like the re-do, fits better in my kitchen. Since it's the wood is cream, I can rotate some seasonal items in it...The Swedish bird candelabra, similar to other other find a while back.I went to a \"vintage store\", really over-priced and most of them reproductions made with barn wood, paint distressing, etc. Not my thing. The I saw this and HAD to have it!A measuring spoon set!!! How cute! $10.00 well spent :)Cute idea I saw at a crafting store. I re-touched the inventory sign in the middle, sorry it's blurry. I may make one!Veggie Garden Progress- I have finally finished the veggie garden, as far as planting any more starts. I filled in today with 2 more tomatoes, and an Anaheim pepper, all 1/2 price in a gallon pot! I just started seeds today for 2 kinds of bush beans, one Italian. I'll plant those in a few days after they soak. Then, I'm done, no more room at the inn :)  I'm hoping to have enough tomatoes to can, we'll see how the harvest does...﻿"},
{"title": "Free Chicken Pergola, Recipes- Graham Crackers & Marshmallows, Rhubarb Sauce, Independence Days Challenge, Garden, Staycation Ideas", "date": "Jun 19, 2012", "text": "Free Chicken Pergola-I was looking thru the free Craigslist ads Sunday and had a \"I know I can do something with that!\" moment. It was in the neighborhood too! It was used to cover a stump, and I've seen them before in expensive catalogs. It's metal, wood, and plastic lattice. When we got it home, I said I wanted to use it for the chickens for extra shade in the veggie garden, and I thought we could elevate it on concrete blocks. Dave said, \"we can take off one panel for a doorway\", ta da! Chicken pergola, no blocks needed! I hosed it off, added a little perching branch inside, a waterer next to it and the girls are using it :)Recipes- Graham Crackers& Marshmallows-I have been wanting to make some of these for a while, so I decided to try these recipes. I love graham crackers for a low fat, low calorie snack. The marshmallows we'll save for barbecuing times, except for tonight :)I used the following recipe for the marshmallows. I'm not a big fan of corn syrup, with that icky aftertaste, so I used this recipe.  Homemade Marshmallows W/O Corn Syrup Pretty simple for a first try. I will use some of Mary Jane's Chillover powder next time, I just need to buy some. her powder doesn't have an exact match for regular powder however. I don't make gelatin much, the kids are grown, but the M.J. stuff it might be good for some fresh fruit recipes, etc. The result was soft & fluffy! I found this a little dry so I added about 2 TBL. of ice water, worked fine after that. Recipe For Graham Crackers I cut them a little too thick, and they were more moist than crispy, I'll work on that next time. Maybe too much water?  Loved the favor though! We had s'mores, oh boy! I worked it off today  :)Sorry for the blurry shotRhubarb Sauce-For Father's Day I decided to make my hubby some rhubarb sauce (which he loved growing up) to go with the Citrus Angelfood Cake I made. My Recipe-2 cups 1\" chunks rhubarb, thawed and drained (I froze mine)2 cups strawberries, cut in 1/21/4 water1/4 - 1/2 sugar: depends on the ripeness of the berriespinch saltBring to a simmer, stirring once in a while, until it starts to break down, about 10-15 minutes. Remove from heat and let sit. Stirs once in a while as it cools. It was great in top of the cake! Sauce before-Last night I made my favorite Garden Cheddar Frittata. It's GREAT with my home grown tomatoes on top once they ripen! I left out the taters, added 1 chorizo sausage (crumbled), sun dried tomatoes on top, and used extra sharp cheese. Yummy! ﻿Independence Days Challenge- 1. Plant Something- Added 3 more tomatoes and peppers to the garden today. I have some crookneck squash to plant, can't decide where yet... 2. Harvest Something- Eggs, compost, grass clipping.3. Preserve Something- Trimmed my tree :) Too early for me to can. 4. Store Something- Starting to inventory my pantry. Froze some cheese from the trip to the Grocery Outlet. 5. Manage Reserves- Get A Good Deal/Barter/Stock Up/Prep- Got a bunch of stuff a few days ago at the Grocery Outlet. Huge blocks of feta for $3.00! I got 3.6. Eat the Food- Try New Foods/Recipes- Used leftovers for my frittata and new cheeses.7. Build Community Food Systems- I need to go get more rhubarb next door.8. Recycle/Re-Use- Used some more conduit for tomato stakes. Taking in leftover copper pipe to recycle.9. Skill Up- Reading about homesteading recipes.10. Regenerate What is Lost/Salvage Something- Sold our aerobed on Craigslist!Wha Cha Doin\"? Garden- After a scorching 93 degree day (and windy too!) we had 2 days in the mid-70's nice break! It's 65 right now, go figure! Today I mowed, prunes and planted more veggies. Veggie starts are showing up 1/2 price or less locally, always good to fill in the bare spots. Since we took down the chicken \"sun room\" we got back that garden space! I still have some room since we moved our border and fence out 3'.Staycation Ideas- I have noticed the trends for \"Staycations\", fun stay-at-home vacation ideas. We went to Portland for Christmas, to see my husband's family. It was fun, but I always think of real vacations as a summer thing- camping or road tripping. We camped a lot with our kids (now grown) and did a few Oregon coast budget motel see-the-light houses trips. This year we had planned on going camping over into Wyoming or Montana, but with Dave's shoulder surgery (ouch!) and gas, maybe not. So we're trying to do more stuff around town, short day trips, some here's some ideas I've had, you might be able to use too?* Go biking, maybe to lunch, to our local state park, down by the river, or on our \"green belt\". Very environmentally friendly!* Go bird watching out by the Snake River, famous for raptors, take photos * Go to local museums on their free days* Visit the renovated state capitol building, just avoid the politicians!* Just get outside somewhere! Staying in at home and playing video games, for instance, is not my idea of intellectually satisfying or recharging my batteries time. No room for a tent in our yard.... What do you do?               Extreme Couponing-I watched the show Extreme Couponing last night. As I've been losing weight, mostly from eating more whole foods and working with a nutritionist (free thru my job) I look at this kind of thing from a different angle. While I love a great deal, I also looked at what are these people actually buying to eat? The woman last night wanted to save $600.00 for a home repair, a great idea. She spent a huge amount of time, with her 2 daughters, clipping coupons. Short version- end of episode she walked out with $600.00 of sports drinks, candy and paper towels. She was ecstatic. She was also prettty overweight. She spent all this time and money for non-food items and is teaching her kids this \"skill\". Unless you're a professional athlete, who will drink all those drinks? Who needs all the candy? Neither of those are food items in my opinion. Sure we all need a treat once in a while, but a huge stockpile? I read the article below that showed how most of the foods \"bought\" with coupons are over processed, high fat/salt/sugar/calorie items. Things like boxed/frozen foods, and other forms of junk food. We all probably use some kind of paper products (you can use cloth napkins)- toilet paper, and things like plastic bags, but really, what is a normal amount to stockpile? You can't eat it in the long run. This is REALLY scary- Junk Food Diet Linked to Lower IQs In Toddlers  but not a big surprise.Usually eating healthier will save you money and heartache in the long run. It may not be hoarding, but more like being OCD, doing gambling or any other addictive behavior. If something \"free or cheap\" isn't good for you what's the point? It's the \"high\" of getting it free. Many of these poverty family's time would be better spent doing some basic financial planning education (free at the library/bank), family planning (if you're in poverty why are you having more children?) and using the time to learn about basic nutrition. Reading library books is free. Make some things from scratch, use your couponing time to get a part time job or volunteer- go help out someone else. Barter and learn to use your simplicity/thrift skills- grow your own food (we do on our little city lot), preserve it and learn what's important... I won't be watching this show again, it makes me want to get them some free counseling!Fascinating look- Extreme Couponing Processed Food HoardingEverparent- Is Extreme Couponing Hoarding Processed Junk?"},
{"title": "Vintage Finds Display, Rehabbing Old Stuff, New Member Of the Family, Garden and Cookies!", "date": "Jun 15, 2012", "text": "Vintage Finds Display- After scoring recently with My Vintage Kitchen Finds, I was left with the problem of finding a spot to display them. I thought about on the soffit area above the kitchen cabinets, on top of my china hutch, a shelf over the door, etc. Still stymied, I thought of my little french shelf by my computer in the kitchen. with some of my Grandfather's WW1 French items, which I will re-display somewhere else. I also put out my vintage Foley food mill to complete the vintage look on the counter :) I'm happy I didn't have to put out any $$ for this, and it was easy. If, or I should say, when I go back to to the little store I got these from, I might have to change my plans since I will buy a few more:)  I read the shade of green on these utensils is called \"french green\". Who knew! I used the cheese slicer a few days ago, it's still sharp! I did paint the handles of the pancake turner and mixer, since they were bare, to match. I was lucky to find a fairly good match at a crafts store. Since I'm not selling them I think it looks good. They had red paint originally, just a speck or two left. I used a craft store piece of unfinished wood for the cookie cutters, to go above my range. Rehabbing Old Stuff- I've had a couple things I've wanted to re-do, so I got out the left over paints. This little wooden box was just too dark brown, and so off white/cream color, maybe for when I buy more green vintage stuff! It was my attempt at a fall prim look, above :)  AnyaOur New Member of the Family- After long and careful thought (after losing Samantha) we decided to get a cat. I had been bugging Dave about getting a cat since last year. I missed having one. We didn't want to get a cat as a \"replacement\" for Sam, but we knew we weren't in that mode. We wound up going to a wonderful no-kill cat shelter called Simplycats. Dave fell in love with Anya, a four year old girl who had to be brought in by her family. I wanted a kitten with 3 legs and no tail, who'd been hit by a car. No go for Dave :(  I surrendered to Anya, ice blue eyes, and who's de-clawed, a plus for Dave. I personally don't believe in de-clawing cats, even 100% indoor ones like ours. I think they need to be able to defend themselves if needed. I'm not convinced we won't have another dog at some point ;) She really friendly and sweet, and she sat watching the birds thru the window. She cracked me up last night- she got on our bed, snuggled right next to me and the blanket, put her face on my elbow and looked up adoringly. Oh man, I'm in love now too! Garden- I added a couple more tomatoes in the main veggie bed, did about 1 1/2 hours of pruning, & cleaned up in the front yard. I planted some poppies and calendula from seed. I'll make some calendula tincture if they take, good for sore muscles! Good for my Independence Days list! Make your own meds! The raised bed is coming along nicely, just watering and my 2 old rhubarbs are coming back!!!Cookies! A couple of nights ago I made these- Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookie I used chopped up chunks of bittersweet chocolate leftover from the holiday baking I didn't do. I used pecans and I thought I went to heaven! Oh joy!"},

{"title": "Independence Days Challenge", "date": "Jun 12, 2012", "text": "1. Plant Something- Finally planted main veggie garden with starts. Raised bed is doing great, no more Mr. Stumpy! Started peas & green onions from seed, and transplanted all the basil I started from seed inside. Bought some thyme since mine died...2. Harvest Something- Eggs, grass clippings, chives. Spreading compost, wow, a lot was ready! Got some wonderful rhubarb for free from my neighbor.3. Preserve Something- Froze half a batch of cookies. Still adding more to chest freezer, Costco breads, etc.4. Store Something- Restocked some of the pantry. Froze some of my free, gifted rhubarb and half of the cookies I made last night. 5. Manage Reserves- Get A Good Deal/Barter/Stock Up/Prep- Found a great deal on veggie starts today, so bought a few more tomatoes. Found a nice, new kitchen rug, bought some vintage items- more for my enjoyment than use :) Bought a couple of huge, cheap bags of organic chips from Costco. Got a great deal on some 1/2 price Dansko's for work for in the fall. My feet will thank me :)6. Eat the Food- Try New Foods/Recipes- Made global wraps (recipe coming) to use up some leftovers, and some homemade chocolate chuck oatmeal cookies. Working on freezer food.  7. Build Community Food Systems- Got some wonderful rhubarb for free from my neighbor, about 5 lbs! More coming soon. Will go to farmer's market soon for veggies to can. I will start selling eggs in the fall.8. Recycle/Re-Use- Spreading/adding more compost, feeding chickens more food scraps. Will be building a new deck cabinet out of reclaimed wood to use an old window screen for the door, for storage. Got rid of my big iced tea maker, freed up some counter space. Now using a nice, smaller tea pot, which will work for winter tea too. Have sold a few things thru Craigslist, like our old doggy divider for our SUV we don't have anymore. Flipped over our stained living room rug to use clean side, until we can get a new one. Still working on cleaning out my closet for charity donations. Weird how attached we can get to clothing that is too big, but has sentimental value. I'm doing it in small batches.9. Skill Up- Dave and I tackled getting the huge broken branch down off our tree after the 65 mph winds came thru. Neither of us, or the chickens, got killed, which is always nice. Survived pretty comfortably with no power for a while. Knew where to find my lamps, crank up radio, etc. Prepped early for the storm. It's scary how many people are totally oblivious to nature :(   Learned how to freeze rhubarb. Met with advisor on insurance and retirement ideas. There's a lot to learn.10. Regenerate What is Lost/Salvage Something- Moved a few perennials and evergreens to better location light-wise for better growth and to fill in open spaces. Will be dividing some more to move. Will be spackling some areas in the house to touch up the paint. Will be doing some gutter painting too, oh joy! Deep cleaning the garage, shed and house now that I'm off for the summer. I'll be starting a project list soon..."},
{"title": "Planting & Chicken-Proofing The Veggie Garden, Integrating Chicks to Flock, Food Swap Network", "date": "Jun 11, 2012", "text": "Planting & Chicken-Proofing The Veggie Garden- With all the wild ups and downs of the weather, 50's one day, then 80's two days later, I'm glad I waited to plant. With the 65 mph winds last week, my veggie garden probably would have been flattened. Dave and I spent several hours yesterday planting, spreading compost and moving a few shrubs to new locations to save them. Next year I hope to start more veggies from seed, but this year I bought most as starts- 9 tomatoes (lots of heirloom), 3 peppers, 2 kind of cukes (trying pickling ones for the 1st time), and an eggplant. I started some peas and green onions from seed. Then there are the little basils I started from seed. I split them up yesterday into pots! Holy basil, Batman, that's a LOT of basil. We love it... I know I have more room to plant after we get the sun room down this week, will try some beans and more eggplants...I knew I had to chicken-proof my seeds and cukes or they'd get uprooted, like last year. Scanning the yard for ideas, I came up with my 2 \"seed/plant\" protectors-Over my green onion seeds, an inverted plant tray from my veggie purchase, staked down. Will let water and light thru, but no more scratchy-scratchy! I had a really small section of fencing left, and bingo, another protector for me peas! Staked down as well. So far today no problems! Then Dave and I made, and added, 3 scrap fencing rings around the cukes, secured, all done. They look a bit like tomato cages-I also had to chicken-proof my veggie tags too, as last year they got buried. Since we had scrap conduit for tomato stakes, I thought DUCT TAPE! Trimmed and taped, and up where I can see them. I like to track what grows well-Ditto the peppers with leftover bamboo stakesMy new \"Apricot Sprite\" Agastache (hyssop is the common name) that I'm planting by the veggie garden. The aroma is amazing, like lemony mint. The hummingbirds and other pollinators love the stuff! Great for really hot, dry areas-We had to re-plant some ground cover around our little backyard pond, as the chickens dug most of it up last year. Bad girls! I just need to get some pond plants now. We got all the pond components for $20.00 at a yard sale 2 years ago. I LOVE the sound of running water on a hot day. It should look a lot nicer when it grows in...My garden bench, cleaned off finally, still hanging in there after all these years. I just cover the top with plastic every winter- Integrating Chicks to Flock-It's always great getting new babies until you have to integrate them into a really small flock. I had the 2 new girls outside for a while, in their own space, but next to the 2 big girls. Then I had the 4 free ranging together, and Ellie (the big barred rock) was pretty aggressive, I had to gently smack her a few times with a small mop. After several days things calmed down. They all went into the garden together, smaller space, not too bad, a little charging, but no contact. Friday I left the door open between the sun room (it's coming down this week) and the main coop. Pretty good again. Saturday night, I just left the door open. The babies slept in the doorway, big girls seem fine finally. Now I can relax!  I think they all worked it out :)  Cool diagram above, huh?From Food Swap NetworkFood Swap Network- I had never heard of this before, but what a great idea! Food Swap Network There isn't one in Boise, but I might start one, since I have the summer off. Has anyone tried this???Here's my little living room table I put seasonal things on. See my little rehabbed, thrift store lighthouse on the right? I painted the upper tube navy and added a silicone bulb. I think it came out cute! I do miss the ocean, sigh...﻿"},

Pie/bread safe, spice rack? We couldn't decide...Vintage Finds- I know, I'm such a hypocrite. Last time I wrote about Voluntary Simplicity and not having too much stuff. Then Dave and I went to Idaho City (an old mining town) yesterday for the afternoon. He's been on vacation this week, with my first week off for the summer. We had cleaned up from the wind storm, done a bunch of boring, mundane projects, so we decided to drive up to the old gold mining town for lunch. It's about an hour outside Boise. There's a nice little diner, Trudy's, with amazing huckleberry cheesecake (they were out!) and good lunches, reasonably priced. Here's some pics of her amazing collection of vintage kitchen ware, that is displayed ALL over the diner. It's like eating in a museum!Before we had lunch we hit a few junk stores, with all of them closed but one. I found this really nice table runner (folded in half) for $3.00, in really nice shape, colors still nice and bright!I had seen a garden and gifts store coming into town and thought I'd check out their tomato plants, since we needed more for the garden. We went inside too, to look around. Cute stuff, then Dave grabbed my arm, quietly steered me whispering \"you have got to see this\", as we came around a corner there was lots of this-Vintage kitchen ware, circa 1920's with \"french green\" wooden handles. I didn't even know what the top right item was, until I got home. It's whipping whisk, which may be from the 1910's. I bought this batch for $15.00, a little less than the $1.99 each. Dave heard the owner say (I was so excited I missed it) \"I guess Trudy will have to live with it\"! Trudy is selling off some of her huge collection, what are the odds :) I just couldn't believe it! It's a real walk thru the history of American manufacturing. The \"all in one\" can opener is marked A & J, (which later sold out to Ecko), \"tool tempered steel, Made in the U.S.A.\" No made in China here. I love the pastry cutter- it actually has a bolt where someone attached (by hand) the handle. Wow. Talk about handmade. I'm going to gently clean the items, a little rust here and there, and display them. I decided to paint my two other items to match, since I don't plan on ever selling them. They're displayed over my stove. These probably had red paint, but I found an exact match of the french green at a craft store today, whoopee!Chopped Salad Recipe-I posted this recipe last time, and made it tonite. Wow, it was great! I left out the avocado, used Romano cheese, added a little more lemon, and garlic powder, excellent. BUT I cut the recipe in 1/2, as that's a LOT of salad! 8 servings at least. Simple Chopped Salad  It's a keeper...Jelly Roll Quilting- I stumbled across this today, what a great idea! Jelly Roll Quilt Video Working full time, I just don't have time to quilt, but I could certainly try this over the summer, and maybe even make my own jelly rolls!Losing Samantha- I couldn't share this til now, but it's still tough. We had to put our beloved Sam to rest 2 weeks ago, due to severe pancreatitis, infection, and some other underlying problems. She was 13. She had never fully recovered from her spleen removal for cancer in Feb. We'd lost 2 other pets, elderly, in the last 3 years. It about killed me. We lost both dogs on Memorial Day weekend too, sad but true. This time was easier to decide, but still extremely painful, because Sam had always been what I jokingly called our \"doggy triathlete\". Never an illness and always really active. It was too painful to watch her decline so fast. She was such a trouper. She never had an accident in the house until her last day with us. Always healthy, and so smart. Aussies (Sam was 1/2) are renowned for being very loyal and devoted to their families. She sure was. We helped her leave at the Humane Society, Dave and I and one of our daughters, talking her all the way thru it. It was fast, thankfully. Coming home, it was the first time in our marriage when we came home to an empty house- no meowing or barking or tail wagging. That really hurt. Here's a photo of Sam a few days before she left us, watching for squirrels from the back deck. It was cold, so I gave her a blanket-I really remember her like this, rolling on her back on a windy, warm spring day a few months back, she was really enjoying herself!We know she went to be with her two friends, Angel our dog and Tinkerbell our cat, both adopted from the Humane Society-I'm so glad all 3 of our furry friends were here with us...Garden Update- Dave and I got the fence all lined up with the coop door, and have more space to plant!

{"title": "What is Being Frugal & Voluntary Simplicity? Delish Simple Chopped Salad Recipe", "date": "Jun 7, 2012", "text": "What is Frugality and Voluntary Simplicity? I started thinking more about this recently. I see some people toss around the word frugal, then buy multiple cars, collect extensive groups of things for decorating (I do it a bit too, so I get it). Go buy an expensive chicken coop kit to match the decor of their backyard, and I think, what? THAT'S one blog I stopped following, but that's just me. To me part of being more self-sufficient to learn to do things yourself: build things, cook, make/re-use things, read, don't waste resources. Also- know when you're out of your league and pay someone to do something for you, like trimming a 30/40 year old, huge maple tree :)  Sometimes being more simple is letting go of others expectations of what you should be, how you should live. That can be very freeing.When I was looking at my pretty empty closet recently and seeing all the clothes that were gone (weight loss) and some I will need to replace for work, I thought- how much do I really need? How many days in the week do I need to fill with outfits? Do/would people judge me if they knew half (or more) of my clothes come from thrift stores, etc? Should I even care? I also thought that sometimes it's better to buy less but higher quality, versus some people who view being frugal or simple as more for less. I'd personally would rather have a few good quality pairs of shoes that 25 pairs of junk. Or eat a small amount of amazing chocolate :) I'd rather have a few good loaves of whole grain breads than cheap white stuff with 0 nutritional value (or make my own). While I love to go thrifting, I'll be working on my food pantry more, especially after our recent storm. That reminded me that many things are simply out of our control. You do what you can. But you'd better do it now, time's a wasting.... Some good questions here- Choosing Voluntary Simplicity.com  I like their positive spin, since I think life shouldn't be about denial... What do you think about frugality vs. simple living?            Delish Simple Chopped Salad Recipe- Next on my list to try. I discovered Katie Brown years ago, when my kids were little. One of the first cooking/DIY shows I ever saw. Love ya Katie! Simple Chopped Salad                                                       Amen sister :)  But sometimes, ya just gotta buy something new...One Person's Trash Is Another Persons Cobbler! I love my neighbor- she's dog sat for us and is so nice. Each year I have lusted after her HUGE rhubarb in her front yard. It's massive, about 4' across (1 plant), ripens, then she throws it away. Meanwhile, my 2 little ones get a small harvest and wither in the heat, but I moved them this year and bought 1 new plant. Hope springs eternal:) This year I got up the courage from my Independence Days Challenge to ask her if I could buy some? She said- take it all, no charge, it's free, help yourself. I nearly swooned!  My husband grew up  eating lots of rhubarb, and my garden has failed in that one crop. Dave got out some clippers and brought back about 5 lbs! That's about 1/3 of what's still out there still ripening! I bought some frozen triple berry mix at Costco, and made a nice, big crisp. I used this recipe- Rhubarb Berry Crunch, cut back on the sugar and added cinnamon to the fruit and topping- it's still cooling, and the cream is waiting for it:)Garden Enlarging- You know how you build something perfect? Then you add something later, and now it's not so perfect? That's what happened with our veggie garden layout. It was fine, until we built the coop. Then it wound up having a fence panel in the middle of the front, large coop panel. Tough to clean, so... I asked Dave if we could move the fence back a few feet? We'd get more room to grow veggies, especially now that we have more light. Here's Dave, he started without me, I was making the cobbler-Dave moved the rock border out 3', then the fence. It's lined up with the small coop door, easy to clean! We'll fill it in with tomatoes and peppers next in that area.We'll gain quite a few square feet. The weather has been wild this week, so my veggies are still on the deck :(  Hopefully in 2 or 3 days we'll plant.My Carpet Re-newal Idea- Last year I bought a nice, jute area rug from Target. Fast forward one year- dog cookie stains and the fabric border is really worn. Lesson learned- buy heavier carpet. It's not in the budget right now to buy a replacement, so.... I had the brilliant idea to turn it over, vacuum it, and whala- new carpet! Old carpet, before-Re-newed carpet, after. It will be fine for a while...Ellie by the raised bed- \"beware of snapdragons\""},
{"title": "Storm Damage- No Power/Lessons Learned, Thrifting, Apple Ring Recipe", "date": "Jun 6, 2012", "text": "Storm Damage: No Power- Well, it's been a couple of \"recovery days\" here. Monday night, about 5/6 p.m. a predicted storm started blowing thru, dropping the temp 25+ degrees. We went from 90 to 55 in a few hours. When this happens in Boise we get severe winds, and hardly any rain. We had gusts up to 60+ mph. We lost power at 7:00 p.m., and lit up our oil lamps and candles as it got darker. As the worst of the wind hit, our huge maple tree started losing small branches, not a big surprise. We had a major trimming done a few months back, which probably helped our tree. Then the bad news- a really large branch broke off and wound up like an upside-down V wedged slightly angled down, half way up the tree. It was still raging wind-wise when we spotted it. It was way too dangerous to attempt to go out and fix at that point, I screamed this to my husband :) I was not amused with him trying to go out. I attribute this to the pressure change, as his brain fluid must have been affected. I had secured our yard/deck, and put our 4 chickens in the 2 sided coop (sun room and main coop, still had the younger girls separated) and was hoping it wouldn't come crashing down on both of those, our fence behind it, or though our picture window. In 60+ winds, it wouldn't fall straight down, it would blow sideways. Of course. The photo above is the aftermath the next day, yesterday. Our power came back on about 1 a.m. yesterday morning. I heard the power trucks going up and down our street Monday in the middle of the night, went out a few times to see where they were working, and only slept about 4 hours or so. I was exhausted yesterday morning. I was happy the power on, as many 1000's still were without it. Then the clean up began. Our biggest concern was the big branch wedged in the tree. It wasn't safe to climb up into the tree to cut and rope it down, as the main branch might go. So, drum roll please (do NOT attempt this at your home)... Dave rented a chain saw on a long adjustable pole, climbed up onto an orchard ladder we have and trimmed it in sections. That part went pretty well, little branches falling down. Then came the bad part- it was still windy and the heavy V section was still up there. Dave was ready to start pushing it off the other branch, knowing the coop might be the target. I had gotten the chickens out to the other side of the yard. As a rebuild lay in our possible future, and flashed before our eyes - I held my breath and prayed (not being a religious, but spiritual person, I pray on a regular basis). Then Dave pushed. I wish I had a video camera, but I was steadying the ladder. Down it came- sideways, diagonally, landed perfectly between the coop, and the berries bushes, in the unplanted garden area, not touching a thing! I screamed, \"that's awesome!!!\"  What are the odds? Dave said when he pushed it looked like it was going straight down headed for the coop, then it swung sideways. I told him it got a little push :)  Then I said lots of thanks. Then the full clean up began, see photo. We used the chainsaw and had it most of the way cleaned up within an hour or so. I took a nap 2 hours later. I saw another employee on the noon news- she had a huge tree fall across the entire house, and smash her roof. I feel very lucky, it could have been much worse here. It snowed in the foothills last night, and was 38 this morning. My tomatoes are waiting in the dining room for a few more nights to be planted, oh well. We went out to dinner last night. I slept really hard, and we did more normal yard work today. Chickens are all still alive, house/garden intact, all is well.Lessons Learned- Except for the tree damage I was pretty happy with how things went. I tend to be OCD about prepping for storms, as I went thru a lot of bad ice storms in Oregon. I had prepped- made an early dinner/dessert, had newer batteries in our flashlights, a crank- up radio (which helped pass the time), and lots of oil lamps. I loved my 2 little LED lanterns, about 4\" high, that were very bright. I got them several years ago for a couple of bucks. We still had water pressure too, but lower, good thing for city folks like us. I do need to get a new water filter, as we had 2 full rain barrels, but our old camping filter died. Will shop around for that. It would have been tricky if the water went out totally, as I only have 5 gallons stored for drinking water.Thrifting- We dropped off some donations today and I found these- a like new Pottery Barn teapot for $4.00. I love the apple green color! We had donated our iced tea maker, since we don't drink as much as we used to, so this will work great instead. Takes up less space, and can be use for hot tea too.Also got this Japanese rice bowl/gravy boat, like new $1.50, cute! Not sure exactly what it would be used for in Japan? Probably holds about 4 cups. Ah, it's the little things in life that give us pleasure...Fun Apple Ring Recipe- What a great idea, and gluten-free too!

{"title": "Medicinal Benefits of Rhubarb", "date": "Jun 3, 2012", "text": "Medicinal Benefits of Rhubarb- Interesting part of this article below- The astringent roots from these plants have been used as a purgative for more than 5,000 years since they have such a strong laxative action; and they have also been used for treating burns, dysentery, appendicitis, toothache, various skin maladies and more. All rhubarbs, both culinary and medicinal, are members of the buckwheat family (Polygonaceae), and the name is believed to have originated from the Grecian Rha, their word for rhubarb. The medicinal rhubarbs of the past had deeply lobed leaves, while the more recent culinary rhubarbs have huge, heart-shaped leaves with less-defined lobes. From- Grit.com Who knew! Lots of great recipes, etc., too in the article. Planted Veggies! Now that school's out I've started plant the veggies in the new cold frame, and moved some shrubs around. I planted the new cold frame with: green cabbage, Swiss chard, mustard greens, collard greens, a new rhubarb and moved the 2 old rhubarbs there. Added some perennial dill, since I never seem to be able to grow it from seed. There's still some room, so I may add some different lettuce mix too. Finally all planted, woo hoo! I planted some snapdragons along the border, and moved a burning bush shrub that needed a new home in the front to add some winter interest. I think it will look nice once it's grown in a bit. I may add more flowers since we can see it from the kitchen and will be looking at it all day, every day. I already had 2 ornamental grasses we left by the frame. My new perennials to the right of it, along the fence, are growing in nicely. I softens the fence, I'm glad I did that :)  I'll be re-seeding the turf in another week, to fill in the bare spots. I need to trim our somewhat broken nectarine tree in the front yard. The city guy came through our easement to spray weed killer (yum) and broke some branches, the bastard. I also have some brown curling on the edges of the leaves. I hope the tree stays alive. I've watered it heavily to flush out the toxins...Lots of basil I grew from seed, ready for pots!Independence Days Challenge-1. Plant Something- In a few day we will start our main, sunny veggies bed. Will plant- eggplant, tomatoes, peppers, pickling cukes, peppers, lemon cukes (my fave!). I'll be planting some flowers to help keep away some of the bugs. Basil babies ready to be put in a pot. 2. Harvest Something- Eggs, rosemary.3. Preserve Something- Clothing, keeping the too-big summer work clothes stuff to take in for fall (it's hot then). 4. Store Something- Nothing in particular this week.5. Manage Reserves- Get A Good Deal/Barter/Stock Up/Prep- Bought some deeply discounted work shoes for the fall on sale, Dave got a \"fresh eggs\" sign at a yard sale. Got a good deal on some big, cheap veggies at a feed store for the garden.6. Eat the Food- Try New Foods/Recipes- Just making stuff, digging into old recipes.7. Build Community Food Systems- I asked my neighbor if I could buy some of her rhubarb (that she never uses!) and she told me to take whatever I wanted, oh boy! Mine fizzled out with the heat. I moved it to a cooler spot. My hubby's co-worker is selling his local butchered chickens. Will price those to buy. 8. Recycle/Re-Use- More composting, feeding chickens food scraps. 9. Skill Up- Reading more homesteading books, this week- The Quarter Acre Farm by Spring Warren. My goal next year is to start more veggies from seed indoors. 10. Regenerate What is Lost/Salvage Something- More clothing to take in. Finished planting raised bed. Saved shrub by moving it. Dave fixed up his bike himself, as it didn't need major repairs (he bought it used). He also put new tires on my bike. Ready to ride!Thrifting- Dave found this at a yard sale for $2.00, how cute! It will go on the coop, of course. I finished painting part of my lighthouse lamp and added the silicone bulb, better than the plain white tube I think...Painted the other small birdhouse. Now I have a red and blue one, sitting on my kitchen window.Big Chicks- Big girls are now transitioning from the outer mini-condo to the big coop. A few pecking incidents I broke up, but not too bad. Ellie, our Barred Rock can be a bit mean :( Still not sure what breed they are. I was supposed to have a Red Sexlink and  a Brown Brahma. I think I may have 2 R.S. or 2 Rhode Island Reds."},

Chicken Burgers  I skipped the salt in the ground chicken mix, doubled the pepper and garlic. Added some sliced purple onion, lettuce, chips and veggies. Yummers! I made this last weekend- Muffuletta Sandwich- a New Orleans speciality from what I've read. Really flavorful and healthy the way I make it. Recipe below, which can be modified-1 round loaf of Italian bread, crusty outside, about 10 inches in diameter4 slices of Genoa salami and provolone cheese           Olive salad-            1 cup black olives, chopped           1 cup of green olives with pimentos, chopped           1 tbl. tiny capers (also good without)           1/3 roasted red bell pepper, diced           2 tsp. garlic, minced           1/4 cup diced celery with leaves           2 tbl. red wine vinegar           6 pepperoncini peppers, stems removed, chopped           2 tbl. chopped flat leaf parsley           pepper to taste           2 tbl. olive oilBegin by making your olive salad first. Chop and mix everything in a bowl, then store in sealed container in the fridge for at least 2 hours. Slice the Italian round loaf horizontally, then remove some of the interior of the bread to make a nice scooped out area. My chickens love the soft bread! Place a generous amount of the olive salad on the base of the bread. Then layer the the slices of salami, then the provolone cheese, then add a layer of olive salad on top, placing the top of the bread on top. Push down slightly, then wrap tightly in foil or plastic and refrigerate for at least an hour. Don't skip this step! When ready, cut into half and serve! Makes about 4 serving, depending on how hungry you are. I serve with chips and veggies. I served it recently to guests and they RAVED, because it's not heavy, but very bright and filling. Perfect for a hot day!Thrifting- I'm fixing up my garden star wall item above. Some of the moss had fallen off, and the dried flowers were pretty old. I bought some new dried flowers, cream colored, dyed them with tea, and will post \"after\" pictures soon. I got it on eBay!I also got this, at a local thrift store, for $1.50. A little lighthouse light, to go on my \"sea table\" I put out in the summer. I'll add some paint on the white, tall tube, and a silicone bulb, and nestle it inside something.I got these for a buck each at a craft store. The one on the left is unfinished, the right is painted. The other one will be navy blue for 4th of July, and summer in general. I also got a wonderful, like-new Eddie Bauer stone colored denim vest for next fall/winter, $3.00. :)  Summer's coming, only 2 more days of school for me!!!"},

And they can fly, oh my! We added a 2nd long box, so now they have a double wide for a home. About 6 feet long. I switched to pine shavings today too. I also moved the outdoor \"playpen\" to the kitchen for some variety on the weekends. With the highs in the low 60's it's too cold for them to got outside. They had a blast! Thrifting- I hit another goodwill store today and found a really cute sunflower, made of solid pine, for $1.99! Also bought some more shorts (which I live in during the summer), and some cute denim overalls (I love those). I haven't had overalls for years, but like them in the cooler weather.The BioLite Stove- I thought this is such a great idea! Great for emergency use, since it's small and easy to store. It generates electricity too, from the heat, to charge up small devices. No fuel to buy either, just use what you have. A bit spendy, but would pay for themselves with regular use, like camping, etc...."},
{"title": "When Did I Start Homesteading?", "date": "Apr 27, 2012", "text": "I was looking around my home the other day, at all the little things that speak to me. That got me thinking- when, and how, did I start homesteading? Bearing in mind I do urban homesteading, I still long for a rural life, old rusty stuff, and animals. A big garden, fruit trees and a barn. Where did all this come from? I started thinking back to all the little, subtle hints that pointed me to the eventual life I'm in- being around my absentee Father, who fixed cars and was a self trained mechanic, taught me how to use tools. Being around a Grandfather, who loved to garden, taught me about growing things. Being around a Grandmother who sewed, canned and cooked from scratch, taught me how to feel friendly in a kitchen. All those little things add up. You never know thru your life what your destination may be until you see the road map getting clearer. Always planning ahead is part of that homesteading thinking- where can I grow more food? Where can I store more food? How much stuff do I need to buy versus making it? How many animals can I support? How should I take care of them? What's my \"bottom line\" on what I will and will not do? Being married sometimes blurs this :)  I could sell this house in a heart beat and move east towards the border of Wyoming where it's much greener, more rural, but with small cities nearby, and have a small acreage. But being married, well I'm still working on that! For now I do what I can where I am and sigh, \"if only....\""},

Now we're yo-yoing between spring/summer. The forecast is for the mid 80's til Thursday! Oh joy, not really. This is just too warm, too fast. I had to unpack my summer shorts, most of which don't fit! Yay! I'm down to about 40 lbs. smaller. So off to the thrift store a couple of days ago, and I scored! Lots of great shorts and a few summer tops. I must say- it's so much easier to find a LOT of clothes my size, now that I'm moving out of the \"plus sizes\". I always hated the lack of choice. I'm big on that :)  I will be taking in some of my favorite summer clothes, to get more mileage out of them. Ironically, I had bought 2 like-new L.L. Bean linen camp shirts during the winter. They're way too big now! Break out the sewing machine!!!Girls Gone Wild! I loved the title, sorry I had to! The little chicks are getter bigger fast. Molly and Rose have been taking field trips out to the living room this week-Rose in the back, Molly in the frontTail feathers coming up!I brought out our $2.00 junk outdoor playpen. It's perfect for the chicks to get a feel for the outdoors during the warm days, and to keep them separate from the two big girls. They had fun today, but cried for me a lot after a while :) They calmed right down when I picked them up, went inside and .... nap time!Garden- I mowed with our push mower, and I think I hit every piece of bark dust in the universe in the front yard, erg! Nothing like it jamming every 2 feet. I finally broke out the rake, and got most of the rest. Looks much better! With all the rain, things are really greening up fast. I washed the outside windows- I love my windex scrubber thingy for windows, it actually works! I cleaned up the clutter in the house, did laundry, whew, busy! My seedlings inside are doing well, tons of basil-leggy nasturtiums, and Swiss chard didn't do so wellBUT, the good news- Dave, my hubby, got a free like-new display case, black wire metal with shelves- about 2' wide, 5' tall, 1' deep. It will be perfect to add a grow light system to next spring and have an \"official seed starting rack\". And it was FREE! I love rescuing stuff that would go in the dumpster otherwise. I just don't have a good set up for windows facing the light in the spring... and since we can get lighting at wholesale... :)Independence Days Challenge-1. Plant Something- We'll be setting up the lumber for the new raised bed tomorrow, for veggie planting.2. Harvest Something- Eggs, chives, grass clippings going into the compost! 3. Preserve Something- Same, freezing more food. 4. Store Something- I keep stocking up on more basics every week, a little at a time. After garden is set up will add another rain barrel for the garden.5. Manage Reserves- Get A Good Deal/Barter/Stock Up/Prep- The 2 new chicks are growing fast! I found a nice, natural wormer, so we won't need to lose any eggs any more! Woo hoo!6. Eat the Food- Try New Foods/Recipes- I'm taking more home food to work for lunch. Working on the last of the homemade canned foods.7. Build Community Food Systems- Going to let co-workers know I will have eggs for sale soon, once wormer is out of their system. I will start going to the farmers market now that they have opened today.8. Recycle/Re-Use- A lot more composting, feeding chickens food scraps. I'm taking in more clothing for summer, again. Bought several items at Goodwill for the hot weather. Will be building a new raised bed from recycled, free lumber Dave got from work.9. Skill Up- Reading Storey's Guide for Chickens and Urban Homesteading by Rachel Kaplan w/K. Ruby Blume, excellent! 10. Regenerate What is Lost/Salvage Something- Keeping bigger clothes to take in. Got the new seed rack components. Re-purposing some pillows soon with leftover fabrics... Great Books- Reading Storey's Guide for Chickens, excellent reference book. I wish I had bought it sooner!!!                                   Also excellent- Urban Homesteading by Rachel Kaplan with K. Ruby Blume! I find some homesteading books too general, this one has lots of very specific ideas                                  I'm also reading Still Life With Chickens- Starting Over In A House By The Sea, a bio by Catherine Goldhammer.

It was so nice, about 65 and breezy! I did one full hour just pruning back my berries. We have 1 raspberry row, 2 Marionberry, and 1 big blackberry row. I dread this job the most in the spring due to the bleeding involved :)  Not too bad yesterday! There's always a lot of dead wood from the winter. This is the \"after\" picture, much better! I'll fertilize soon and hope I have another bumper crop like last year. There are tons of blossoms on my nectarine tree, so I may have enough to can this year!Thrifting- I went to a flea market that come to our state fair grounds every few months. I found these-  $2.00 for the large doily and $3.00 for the vintage screen. I love the green, vintage paint, and steel screen! I'm going to use the screen frame as a display, or put a mirror behind it. The doily is amazing with all the details, and much bigger than the other one I have! It was funny- two women had a booth selling pickled eggs, which I had made for the first time last month! I tried a chunk of a jalapeno one, wow! HOT! Good though, another version to try....I love this version of Independence Day by Little Big Town, amazing harmonies!!!"},

There were damaged areas, and we wanted to open up the food garden with more light. There originally have been a 2nd tree planted too close to it, we had it taken down 4 years ago, but it was lopsided on the south. We had it thinned and it looks much better, is safer and more light! We had 3 bids for it, and the person we used did a great job- asked questions, checked back, awesome clean up. It was expensive, but worth it, as we didn't want to lose the tree or have part of it fall on the house. Luckily we had an easement next to our fence for their bucket truck. Photos here:Big tree huh!Before the trim on the south side-After-Had the old tree stump cut down too, the guy used 3 chainsaws and took a 1/2 hour!Before- After-This will be the new area for the raised-bed veggie spot. More light now! New Titanic Chicks!- We got 2 new chicks last night! One's a light brown brahma and the other is a gold sexlink. Here's the story of trying to come up with names for them- we went out to breakfast this morning, went to the grocery store, came back to.... 2 chicks up on the feeder, with the entire 1 qt. waterer knocked over and about 1/4\" of water all over the floor. They had cold feet and I have no idea how long they were like that! Poor babies! Dave wiped out the crate, and put in clean paper towels, while I held them and warmed their feet. I put them back in and they warmed up, drank some water, and fell asleep. I had been thinking about 2 strong female names for them. Then I got the names- Titanic's 2 strong women: \"Rose\" (from the movie) and the unsinkable \"Molly\" Brown since they survived the icy water! Ha! Rose and Molly it is. Molly will be the louder one- the Brahma, Rose the sexlink. They survivied their icy bath!!!Rose in the front, Molly in the backIndependence Days- I was getting shocked today at the grocery store with some of the rising prices- like peanut butter: up about $2.50 since Jan. and soda (which we don't drink) is the same price, but now a 1 1/2 liter bottle! It makes sense on the soda since it's tied to corn prices. It's all about fuel. I bought peanut butter to store, and glad I had a spare in the pantry closet. REALLY glad I took my food preservation/storage class!!!1. Plant Something- I planted seeds 2 weeks ago for- basil, calendulas, swiss chard and Nasturtiums. Green and healthy! Prepping new garden bed for food, had stump removed. I decided to plant more raspberries too. Put herb pots outside from the garage. Deeped cleaned the backyard today, prepping for veggie planting.2. Harvest Something- More eggs3. Preserve Something- Freezing more food. 4. Store Something- I stocked up on more more basics- peanut butter, butter, flour, etc. Getting ready to add another rain barrel for the garden, go from 2 to 3...5. Manage Reserves- Get A Good Deal/Barter/Stock Up/Prep- Got 2 new chicks! Bought a reptile ceramic heat disc instead of a red heat lamp for the chicks, as they last much longer and won't shatter. Good deal!6. Eat the Food- Try New Foods/Recipes- I'm getting better at mixing up leftovers into new dishes. I'm taking less frozen Amy's meals to work and using more home food. Although I still LOVE Amy's! All organic and delish!7. Build Community Food Systems- Thinking about some neighbors that let their huge rhubarb harvest go to rot. I'm going to ask to buy some :) Going to let co-workers know I will have eggs for sale soon, once wormer is out of their system. A co-worker also offered to buy some of my organic berries this summer!8. Recycle/Re-Use- More composting, feeding chickens scraps.  Re-used a leftover attic fan roof cover/ sleeve as a rhubard sheild from the chickens (they keep scratching the shoots coming up)! Perfect! I'm taking in more clothing for summer. Bought several items on eBay for nice, well made, cheaper clothing. Will be moving river rocks out from garden edge back 2 feet, to create larger veggie area.9. Skill Up- Bought Storey's Guide for Chickens. Reading more homesteading books from the Library.10. Regenerate What is Lost/Salvage Something- Had huge maple tree thinned, to protect and save it.

The old pagan symbols- the goddess and the egg, all fancied up and ready to be hunted after and found!  Bunny- symbol of fertility, like I had to tell you that right? Even the word Easter relates to several goddess names, from what I've read...Celebrating fertility and the goddess (in ancient times) in the spring, when you're planting your crops, all makes sense. I find it interesting how many ancient rites have later been co-opted by organized religions, but that's old news. When we moved to Idaho and asked some new co-workers (who were of a certain religious persuasion) if their kids went Easter egg hunting, they gave us an odd look. We assumed this was pretty common even for non-religious folks. In their religion it was \"planting day\". Later we were wondering what the heck they were talking about, since we'd never heard any Christians use that term. Even late coming to the scene religions change things. It never ends, oh well.....  Homemade Lacto-Fermented Sodas- I'm reading Urban Homesteading by Kaplan and Bloom. What an excellent read! I'm interested in possibly making homemade sodas. I won't do the \"whey\" in mine since I'm allergic to dairy, but there's the ginger version. I'm still in the research phase, but it's a great idea! Gotta buy a copy!

Organizedhome.com-PantrySour Tomatoes Recipe-  I had never heard of these before but, come summer, I will make some from my home-grown ones. From: Backwoodshome.com I love their free, online magazine! \"This is an old Pennsylvania Dutch recipe and is not at all complicated. Basically the principle is much the same of that of sauerkraut. There are only five items needed for these fermented tomatoes: tomatoes, grape leaves, salt, alum, and water. The tomatoes must be ripe but firm. Our preference has been Early Girl, but last year by chance we discovered Mortgage Lifter and this year Amish Paste, either of which would work equally well. Last year, my son and daughter-in-law used Romas and produced some of the best we have ever had. The choice is yours, but remember the tomatoes need to be ripe and firm. To begin, choose a container suitable in size to your intentions. I use either a crock or plastic bucket. My wife always uses her \"sour tomato crock.\" I have always avoided metal for fear of a chemical reaction to the salt.Begin with a cushion layer of grape leaves which will compact to at least 1/8 inch. Next, a single layer of tomatoes. Continue with this procedure — tomatoes. grape leaves, tomatoes. grape leaves — until your container is full, leaving room for something to hold your tomatoes down in the brine. Now for the brine. Mix 1¼ cups salt to 10 quarts of water. Do not use an iodized salt. I get an 80 lb. bag from the farm supply store and we use this for all our salt needs: table, cooking, and all our pickling, including our pork. To each 10 quarts of water also add 1 tablespoon of alum. Completely cover your tomatoes with brine and put a weight on top.Let them pickle for 6 to 8 weeks. If you find a mold forming over the top, don't panic! Remember, they are fermenting! Dig them out, rinse them in cold water, and have at 'em!\"  By Richard MillerIrish Cookbooks- I got these 3 used cookbooks from Amazon, filled with lots of very old, traditional, simple recipes.

Regenerate What is Lost/Salvage Something- We installed new/better attic fan to keep the house cooler in the summer and save energy. Getting bids for huge maple tree thinning for more food production, and to keep tree healthy. Ouch, that's spendy!﻿Plants- Every spring I have a ritual and plant some pansies in my north-facing kitchen window box. I can see them, they make me smile, and sometimes birds land there and check things out. With lots of water they last all summer into fall- A visitor last year, he pecked on the window for several days in a row, cute little guy!Chives are up too!Violas under the windowStarting Seeds-  I gathered up all my seed-starting stuff a couple of nights ago, and a bucket of potting mix.

They're under the under counter lights for now.Pickled Eggs- I saw a recipe and decided to try some. I made a 1/2 batch, since Dave's not a fan of hard boiled eggs.

Boil for 5 minutes. Then put eggs in jar (I put some onion in the bottom first), pour hot liquid over eggs, seal. Let stand overnight, then refrigerate. Will keep a couple of weeks, in theory. There are lots of other recipes out there online, some with peppers, etc. My Grandma used to pickle eggs and beets together, yum! Here's my batch, and I'll let you know how they taste!

My food pantry closet is a bedroom closet we added sturdy shelves to last year, after trying a plastic shelving unit (bad idea!). It became a food storage area, and also a catch-all for extra small appliances like bread machine, mixer, crock pot, etc. We have a small kitchen and not a lot of storage there. The garage is very hot/cold, so not a good idea either. I'm starting the reorganization process to try and move towards just food. I'm a visual person, and always looking for new ideas, if you have any to share? Last night I moved most of the small appliances out and put all my used canning jars in a clear tote. They were falling out of their box before.Ditto the food canning processor/strainer- got rid of the box, stored the strainers. More room!My main goal is to separate the foods more, by category, and keep them easy to see. I also have some Mylar bags and oxygen absorbers, to re-package things like the sugar, and dry beans I will buy. I know some people invest in the cute chalk board tags at office supply stores, but I got sticker shock when I looked the rices up. I'd rather spend that money on something else, and I'm sure Martha Stewart (one of my least favorite ex-felons) will survive. My eyesight would be pretty bad if I don't know what rolled oats look like! My various flours are labelled with a marker on top of scotch tape, I can remove easily if needed. I'm glad I invested in some 1/2 gallon canning jars thru Ace hardware last summer. A special order item, but great for food storage! I have a lot of large misc. glass jars from family, thrift stores, but I decided to just buy bigger ones.  Six for $12.00 I think... I also realized today that I can move the bathroom dry goods to the cabinet in main bathroom under the counter, duh...The Stump That Keeps On Giving- Poor Dave. What could have been an easy job, cutting a stump down to the ground, became a nightmare. We had the tree removed about 5 years ago, a catalpa, with nasty seed pods. We kept the stump for a birdbath base. We decided to add another veggie bed in the triangular area. So we rented a chainsaw and Dave got to work. Let's just say the home improvement store guy forgot to tell him to tighten the chain every few cuts :(  The first cut was good, partially rotted wood. After that, not so much.We decided to quit with impending rain, and the high rental fee. Oh well. The good news- I'm having 2 tree guys give us a bid for removing the last foot, as long as we're getting a bid for the maple tree thinning. Getting that tree thinned will get much better results in our existing veggie bed, with much-needed sunshine!Independence Days Challenge- I put some dollar store crates in my freezer so I can see what's there, and start from scratch in an organized mode. Before:                                                                                                                                                                After-I sorted things by fruits, veggies, meat, seafood etc. Lots of room to still fill it up, as you can see.

Of course I love the natural colors of my eggs anyway!Victory Garden Art Work- I love this guy's vintagey Victory Garden Art work! A very similar visual style of the post-WW1 government posters! Victorygardenoftomorrow.com He sells posters, tee shirts, postcards and floursack towels. Cool!It was 75 Today- A hmmm, what month is this? I don't like the idea of putting my pasty arms into a teeshirt yet, ew. It was way too warm today. BUT, I did break out some of my summer clothes. They hide under the bed in one of those under-the-bed plastic totes during the winter. The good news- none of them fit! I'm down almost 35 pounds! Luckily some of my favorite shirts will be taken in this week, since I'm on spring break. That way I can still wear them and show off my smaller, pasty arms! I'm so glad I bought a decent sewing machine last summer, a real good investment. Little did I know at the time what I'd be using it for. It was just the right time to lose the weight. My energy is up, and we are certainly saving money on groceries and eating better...New Chicks!I will be shopping for chick this week, wish me luck! Two new babies will come home to add to the flock. I'll be setting up the \"nursery\" in a couple of days. The big girls loved getting out today, with the warm weather. It's raining tonite, and cooling off (thankfully) so all their coop shavings will get watered into the garden, and settle the dust. We're talking about a fall re-design of the coop. While I love the basic use of space, it's tough to clean, awkward for people. We may, basically, raise-the-roof and make it tall enough to put in a full size \"people\" door. Easy for cleaning, etc. Probably in the fall though. Dave can get lots of free scrap lumber at work, so that really helps with the recycling of building materials. We bought very little new for the coop and \"sun room.\"Last Year- Buffy (rip) and Ellie, our Barred Rock﻿"},

I went shopping yesterday and got the first two items at our local feed/garden place. I stocked up on extra feed and pine shavings, since fuel is getting so high. I also bought organic veggie seeds to start, oh boy!Today was coop cleaning day, oh joy!!! I deep cleaned the coop and sun room, all clean and tidy now. Spring break just started today for me, and I knew it would be mild- 62 degrees. The deep litter method works so well, no odor, I just deep clean it every 3 months or so. I do, however, clean the \"condo\" and nest boxes daily. All the pine shavings went out into the veggie garden and the girls are tilling it in already! Ellie looking up- \"what do you want now!\"Lots of good stuff for the berry vines-They has some new little chicks for sale, but I like to go to the big local hatchery, Dunlap's, outside town, as they have such a huge selection of pullet chicks for sale. I will probably pick up 2 new babies this week, just trying to decide on which breed- something I don't have. Rosie is a Rhode Island Red, and Ellie is a barred rock. Rosie is such a trouper though, I may get another R.I.R., but I also like these as a possibility- Brown Leghorns-New Hampshire Reds-Since we lost Buffy, our Orpington, recently, and I'm not ready for another one, and she was almost too big for our space. Thrifting- Last night I bought some jeans, shorts and a summer blouse. On eBay I bought some Dansko like clogs, used Irish Cooking cookbooks (dang missed St. Pat's Day!), a like-new parka from a big name American company (think Maine) for 25% of the full retail. Another homestead blog showed a similar one of these, so I bought one! It's a magnetic dishwasher cover that I thought would go well with our color scheme and protect the front, cute! And kind of camouflages the occasional drips, etc :)Independence Days- See some of the above: stocking up on feed, clothing/shoes, getting more chicks. We bought some small crates last night for me to organize our new freezer. Our attic fan died last summer (unknown to us then), so Dave installed a new, bigger/better one today. It will keep the house much cooler in the summer, and cut down on the AC, which we're lucky to have. We did join a voluntary AC program that reduces the  use during peak time and saves us some $$$. we'll be expanding our veggie area soon, and I hope we can afford a tree person to come in and create more sunny area for us to grow in. I'm looking for another food dehydrator, to dry more.Food Storage Questions- I thought these were excellent questions out of my spring Foods Preservation and Storage class I'm taking:  What am I storing food for?  What are my concerns?  What kinds of situations are likely in my region? How much food do I want to store?  For how many people/pets?  How much water do I want to store?  Am I likely to have people outside my immediate household who are with us in a crisis?  Are there other things I want to store – clothing, medical supplies, tools?  What are they? How much time and energy do I have to devote to this?  How much space do I realistically think I have to devote to this? How much money can I spend each week/month on this project.  Where will my stored food come from?  How much of it will I grow/produce?  What are my goals for food preservation?  How much of my food will I buy, and from where?  What can I get locally, and what do I have to get through the industrial food system?  What’s the best and most ethical source for my food?  What do I imagine doing with my food storage? Do I want it mostly to provide a hedge against a crisis, or for day to day use?  Do I imagine myself eating regularly out of it and replacing it?  Do I want to be able to share with others, or is my first priority protecting my own?  How will I prevent loss of food to age, insects, mold?Very thought-provoking, and better to answer now, than later. I'm feeling a real need to stock up now, with fuel prices being uncertain in the future, than kick myself later. I am able to purchase things easily, and who knows what the next few months/Fall could look like? What if our fruit trees fail this year, etc.? (sorry for the font change, sometimes blogger drives me up a tree!!!)"},
{"title": "The \"Modern\" Life: Some Pros and Cons", "date": "Mar 22, 2012", "text": "After I read Sue's blog Thestuffthatkeepsmeawake I found myself asking the same questions. Here's the part of her list that I found common ground on. Her words are italicized, mine are not-﻿Pros:Internet-what a great way to meet like-minded people- Indeed! That's how I would up blogging!Internet-for people that HATE shopping-what a great way to get that chore out of the way- I have never loved shopping, I do it guerrilla style- get in, get outInternet-what a great source of information for those with an insatiable curiosity. YES! I do research of some kind almost dailyInternet-all the garden seeds you could ever possibly want! Yes, a great way to find out what you can plant where you areInternet-able to order ANY book and get it sent to my local library. AMEN sister! I LOVE putting \"holds\" on stuff!Digital Cameras, Yes, so easy to point, shoot, delete what doesn't work and post online quickly.Energy Star appliances. Despite having way more electronics than 20 years ago, my electric bill is under $40 in the summer/$50 in the winter Yes, me tooLow-water usage washing machines. I swapped this to \"pro\" because mine works great!Cellphones--And you'll see this one in my \"cons\" list too! Yes, I love the easy use and portabilityCons:Corporations running our country. Buy a congressman--get what you want! Yes can you spell GREED? I would add- corporate political groups tooShoddy products / poor workmanship I'm shopping smarter because of that. I buy a lot of quality items on eBay and at thrift stores.Low moral values That's a personal perspective, but I find much of the \"youth\" of America overly self-involved, lazy and not a lot of critical thinking going on for the media-ed majority. BUT I am hopeful they will wake up some day, but maybe not. Parents sometimes just don't care... Drugs...EVERYWHERE!. Schools in particular are full of kids \"trading\" prescription drugs. We are an addicted society. Anyone who thinks we aren't should think about this- IT HAS BEEN ESTIMATED THAT 80% OF ALL ADULTS IN THE U.S. ARE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF DRUGS, ALCOHOL, OR PRESCRIPTION MOOD ALTERING DRUGS AT ANY GIVEN TIME. 80%. Death of the family. Amen, but I am hopeful that we will figure that out. I think \"family\" is also perspective based. I think many parents are to blame for this, viewing their children as property and not people.High crime rates and a shortage of police to deal with it. Our prison system is broken, period. It just doesn't work.High Fructose Corn Syrup What more can I say :)Food with ingredients you need a degree in Chemistry to decipher AMEN!Round-Up ready crops- Plants that can be sprayed with a herbicide that KILLS everything. Us too? What is the point here? More corporate greed.Cell phones ---in restaurants/theaters/libraries People are losing their people skills, and losing their in-person relationship skills.Big Brother--he's watching you and every day you lose more and more freedoms. SOPA/PIPA  How much freedom are you willing to give up to be \"safe\"? I'd rather have a little less safety than know my rights are being eroded by the people who are supposed to be protecting them."},

I have a small wire bookcase I may add lights to. I'll have to play with that idea. The Spring Food Preservation and Storage Class has been really informative!

No bars or green beer for me. I made a wonderful batch of corned beef, carrots, cabbage and Yukon gold potatoes yesterday. It was the best batch of corned beef I'd ever made, as I spent a little more and got a better \"flat cut\". I used the seasoning packets, add a tablespoon of whole peppers corns, and a couple cloves of smashed fresh garlic. Simmer for 1 hour per pound, and it came out really tender!I also made some Hot Cross Buns, which I had never made, as a test batch for Easter. I used this recipe, great for smaller families- Allrecipes.com You could easily double/triple the recipe. I used only raisins and a little extra allspice. Here they are after the 2nd rise-After baking, pre-icing. Really great flavor, not too sweet. I had 3, Dave had 2, while watching the movie The Shipping News (filmed in Newfoundland, wonderful, adult film), which seemed appropriate. Some of the characters were originally from Britain. OMG, they were awesome, blew my calories for the day, but worth it! They are best served warm...Thrifting- I had some more donations for a local thrift store, as I'm still losing weight. I picked up 5 designer tops for $19.99! It is so much EASIER to find smaller clothing now, that's a relief. I got a Ralph Lauren flannel blouse, a Columbia Sportswear summer blouse, a denim jacket, a corduroy blouse, and a Coldwater Creek summer blouse, all like new. I really scored! I saved the couple that are a little too small, as they will fit in a month or two. It's fun to shop ahead, knowing I'm still shrinking, it's a great way to plan ahead...One Sad Dog- Samantha, our sweet Aussie mix, was really missing Dave, as he had to work out of town for two days. The first night she had laid on his pillow, shifted a bit as I took photos. That expression says it all- where is he??? She was sniffing around in his closet the next morning, as she was really lonely-RAIN, RAIN GO AWAY... Now if it would just stop raining I could get out in the yard! At least it's spring break in one more week. I hope it dries out soon..."},

Below is my little side table in the living room - some fresh flowers, the Irish flag for this week, and my horsetails. A little spring insideI loved the green nature photos on Mytinyplot! Gorgeous! It's amazing what we don't see each day...Freezer- We've been looking into buying a chest freezer, to be able to store more food. It does pay to shop around. We thought about getting a used one, but the 7 cu ft. sizes aren't a bad deal, new. I found a great deal on some corned beef, for St. Patty's day. I will buy more hopefully to freeze, as I'm hoping for one this weekend. I'm hoping to plant at least one more fruit tree, so the space will really help. I'm going to re-do my pantry closet, and store more fast. Gas prices are WAY up, and this looks like the long haul for now, maybe.Fishing- I'm looking into taking some fishing classes, or finding a group of local women to fish with. No \"catch and release\" for me! I want some fish to eat! More local \"food\" :)  I'll post something when I get something going."},

The grass is greening up, and so I let the girls out for some fun in the main backyard. Eating fresh grass was a treat for them, and they found some HUGE worms! It was 65 today, unbelievable, and so I washed the outside windows. Wow, I can see out now! The main living/dining room windows face the incoming, prevailing storms, so they get dust and rain spots all over. Looked pretty yucky til today. I fired up the hose and my little windex kit, with a pole and scrubber pad. Great product for a good, fast clean up. I am so looking forward to spring break! Only two more weeks! I'll deep clean the coop and do some garden prep, depending on the weather, as it usually RAINS :(                                                        I was walking thru Target's Easter section and spied this egg holder. I thought- perfect for hard boiled eggs! Works great in the fridge. Nice, heavy ceramic-Happy Early St. Patrick's Day!Being part Irish I really enjoy the the upcoming holiday. I do skip the green beer though, ew. I usually make Irish potato and leek soup, and Irish soda bread for dinner, with apple butter. Sometimes I do a boiled dinner of corned beef, cabbage, potatoes and carrots. Not truly \"traditional\", but nice on a cold night. Someday I hope to visit there, and see the real Ireland-Antrim, IrelandIndependence Days This Week-1. Plant Something- we prepped the veggie bed by spreading all our ready compost. The chickens LOVED that, Mommy's little diggers! I came up with an area we can install a raised bed/fenced garden area, to keep Samantha, the dog, out. Fairly sunny, just need to remove rotting stump. That will be a nice sized bed to grow more food in!2. Harvest Something- Eggs! Chives are coming up!3. Preserve Something- Shopping for a freezer. Hosed down the outside of the coop.4. Store Something- I stocked up on more canned fruits, frozen vegetables today (2 lbs. organic green beans at a grocery outlet!). Bought some smaller jelly jars for canning. 5. Manage Reserves- Get A Good Deal/Barter/Stock Up/Prep- See above. Also inventoried pantry.6. Eat the Food- Try New Foods/Recipes- Hard boiled lots of eggs! Checked freezer for buried foods.7. Build Community Food Systems- still working on that, it's spring, barely.8. Recycle/Re-Use- More scraps to the chickens, using the composting bin. Spread more leaves into the garden. Will look at some recycled wood for the new raised beds.9. Skill Up- Still doing my spring food preservation/storage class. Figure out what to plant in new raised bed.10. Regenerate What is Lost/Salvage Something- We remembered our attic fan is dead, and will install a bigger, better one to keep the house cooler in the summer and save energy. Add a 2nd gable vent too. Will get tree trimmed soon to increase sun in veggie garden.﻿﻿"},

Not bad for part time blogging, and starting late last summer. I know some people have done 1000's, but I'm not that committed to quantity with my job, etc. and getting things done on the home front. Someday I'll hit 1000! Oh boy!The Amish in America- I watched this documentary on PBS last week, The Amish- An American Experience,  and it was really fascinating. It's here to watch, free, online- Pbs.org  I found the background of their practices, and their persecution, riveting. I also found this related story particularly gripping: (I'm paraphrasing) When an Amish man was asked what the main difference between he and non-Amish was , he responded by asking the group of tourists, \"do you watch too much TV?\" Almost all the hands went up. \"Do your kids watch too much TV?\" Ditto. He asked- \"how many of you are willing to get rid of your TVs?\" No hands went up. He said said \"that's the difference. We would get rid of anything we think is harmful to our family.\" Interesting. Independence Days- This last weeks total:1. Plant Something- Bought herb and flower seeds, will plant soon :)2. Harvest Something- Eggs! Everything else is still frozen, more or less. 3. Preserve Something- Saved and dried some lime peels for baking, etc. My hands smell great!4. Store Something- I stocked up on canned fruits, and vegetables today, paper products, as they were very low in the pantry.5. Manage Reserves- Get A Good Deal/Barter/Stock Up/Prep- See above. We're getting a freezer soon, and that will go a big way towards having more reserves on hand. Dave and I agreed with fuel prices, wanting to be more self-sufficient, it will be a good investment. I want an upright, maybe.6. Eat the Food- Try New Foods/Recipes- Making a frittata tomorrow with all those eggs! Used some of my home-frozen green bell peppers for dinner tonite.7. Build Community Food Systems- will be getting new chicks soon, to sell more eggs eventually to co-workers.8. Recycle/Re-Use- Scraps to the chickens, recycling paper, glass, etc. (each week), starting to use the composting bin in the kitchen again. We stop in the winter as it's frozen anyway, and give the hens the scraps instead. They loved the turkey breast bones tonite! I'm also saving my leftover almond milk cartons to use to plant seeds in.9. Skill Up- Doing my spring food preservation/storage class. Great stuff! Reading more blogs for ideas. 10. Regenerate What is Lost/Salvage Something- Almost always doing this on some level. I found some of my daughter's old sheet music the other day (shhh, don't tell!), and am going to use that and re-purpose for a craft project. An acquaintance offered to give me free fruit this summer that they grow and don't need. I may need more canning jars!Spring?- The weather has been wacky again. Snow a few days ago (just a bit), 60-ish yesterday, today, and tomorrow, rain/snow later in the week. I want to plant/prune, but it's just too early. I'm praying my 2 fruit trees don't blossom too early, then freeze. Yikes, no fruit! Samantha enjoyed the warmer weather. Nothing like having your dog rolling in the wind and dirt 2 days after her bath :)Nap time-Atleast her fur is growing back in, after her surgery. Her tummy looked so naked!Cell Apps For Homesteading- I got a new HTC Inspire smart phone, with \"android\" as the operating system. It took a day or so to get used to it, but it's much better than my old one. One of those \"free\" deals at Costco, love those! There were several free little apps (mini programs on the phone itself) I got that fit right in with homesteading- a better, brighter \"flashlight\" than the one that came with it. A compass- works great! A \"severe weather warning\", that you can customize. FatSecret.com has one too, since I'm still losing weight, a good helper when eating out. They have one I need to get, that networks local people selling and buying local foods! Spring/summer will be great for that! I just need to go back and install it. I'm sure there might be some useful apps that are low cost, but there's so MANY I haven't had the time to go thru yet...                     ﻿"},

This is a repeat of Tuesday, when it was really warm, 54, then blew in a cold front with rain. Three days coming of snow/rain/wind. Nothing like the strong wind to put things into perspective- nothing you can do but wait it out. I always loved John Denver's song:Windsong﻿The wind is the whisper of our mother the earthThe wind is the hand of our father the skyThe wind watches over our struggles and pleasuresThe wind is the goddess who first learned to flyThe wind is the bearer of bad and good tidingsThe weaver of darkness, the bringer of dawnThe wind gives the rain, then builds us a rainbowThe wind is the singer who sang the first songThe wind is a twister of anger and warningThe wind brings the fragrance of freshly mown hayThe wind is a racer, a wild stallion runningThe sweet taste of love on a slow summer's dayThe wind knows the songs of the cities and canyonsThe thunder of mountains, the roar of the seaThe wind is the taker and giver of morningsThe wind is the symbol of all that is freeSo welcome the wind and the wisdom she offersFollow her summons when she calls againIn your heart and your spirit let the breezes surround youLift up your voice then and sing with the windI knew today would be sunny and mild, the calm before the storm, so I decided to let the girls, Rosie and Ellie, out of the coop and into the backyard! What excitement! They got some big worms, ate the grass which is greening up. Got to flap/fly across the yard. Oh boy! We filled up the feeder, and cleaned and filled the waterer before dark. All set for the storms. Didn't have time for photos, but here's last year's summer romp-                         My first three, when they were little puffballs, so cute! I'll probably get 2 new babies this spring since I lost one, and only Ellie is laying now. I've never heard of a healthy hen who quit laying when she was 2, last fall, but Rosie stopped laying.

Plant something- I am planning my next garden, does that count? Too cold to plant yet, BUT I will be deep cleaning the coop soon and spreading all the good stuff in the beds! I guess prep counts!2. Harvest something- Eggs daily! They are so delish, I just can't figure out why Rosie stopped laying after 1 1/2 years??? Lazy girl...3. Preserve something- My own food in the fridge right now. I would have to use store bought food to preserve right now, not big on my list. I'm still eating my canned items from last summer, though!4. Waste not- I'm doing much better cooking with what I have, and since I'm losing weight/eating healthier. We're saving money there too! Recycling out my old clothing. I'm also buying more (smaller!) used clothing for work, since I am working towards a few more sizes down. I don't want to but a lot of new clothes for a couple of months. School's out in June then it's shorts and tee shirts! They're cheap!5. Want not- I'm saving Sam's leftover surgery meds for any future emergency, re-using my daughter's bulb pot she gave me for some plants indoor house plants, getting ready to deep clean our linen closest. I know there's a bonanza of misc. meds, and stuff etc. in there! Dave and I got a great deal at the Reebok Outlet store- cheap sneakers already and we got the \"2nd pair 1/2 off\". We each got a new pair of walking shoes (I wear them to work) and saved a bundle. It pays to shop around. I will always check there first! My $60 shoes were $15.00!6. Eat the food- I have been doing a lot more home cooking, fresher, and much easier to track what I'm eating. I will say working with a dietician (free thru my work) makes you much more aware of what you eat.7. Build Community Food systems- Working on that one, but I buy local whenever I can. It's just off-season right now, only herbs locally.8. Skill up- Improving my photo and thrifting skills!Backyardchickens.com-  It has a whole new look! I haven't had to time to check out all the new features, but I will be submitting an article to win some $!"},

I doubled the recipe, and modified it by adding 3/4 cup leftover white wine, 2 TBL. flour in 2 TBL. olive oil (to thicken a  bit), doubled the garlic, and added a few shots of Tabasco. It was really great and Dave loved it too!I read the history of it, short version- The addition of tomatoes in place of milk was initially the work of Portuguese immigrants in Rhode Island, as tomato-based stews were already a traditional part of Portuguese cuisine. From: en.wikipedia.orgIt was really perfect served with a crusty baguette, filling and healthy. Using canned clams and juice, it would have been better with fresh, but, we live in Boise, sigh.Spring Weather- We've been having high 40's weather lately, bizarre. It's way too early to garden, but I'm getting antsy. Dave and I were talking, over lunch in Idaho City, about what we could start on the window sills? We went to Idaho City, since it was mild, to get out of the house, go for a drive, and have lunch. Clear roads, and only some snow on the sides of the road near the upper elevations. Trudy's is a little cafe with great food, and AMAZING huckleberry cheesecake. We bought one slice only since we're both losing weight, and are trying to moderate :)  It's worth it. A little Idaho City history, just an hour outside Boise:History-Idaho City was founded in December 1862 as \"Bannock\" (sometimes given as \"West Bannock\"), amidst the Boise Basin gold rush during the Civil War, the largest since the California gold rush a dozen years earlier. Near the confluence of Elk and Mores Creeks, its plentiful water supply allowed it to outgrow the other nearby camps in the basin, such as Placerville, Pioneerville, and Centerville. As its population swelled, the new Idaho Territorial legislature changed the town's name to \"Idaho City,\" to avoid confusion with Bannack, Montana, in present-day Beaverhead County, the southwestern corner of Montana.At its peak during the mid-1860s, there were more than 200 businesses in town, including three dozen saloons and two dozen law offices. Its 1864 population of 7,000 made it the largest city in the Northwest, bigger than Portland. Wood was the prime source of both shelter and heat, which caused Idaho City to burn four times: 1865, 1867, 1868, and 1871.[2] In 1863, St. Joseph's Catholic Church was established; it was the first Catholic parish in the new Idaho Territory.                     From- en.wikipedia.org"},

Went into a \"now what\" mode? Thursday had a ultrasound- showed a 2\" tumor on her spleen, very common in older dogs. We had to make a value judgement, and think finances, about whether or not to have the surgery. We opted for it, had it done Friday, as it was very local and everything else looked clean. No spreading of the cancer. So far, she's doing really well! She's wearing her BooBooLoon, a new version of the awful \"radar dishes\" they used to have to wear.

For this, I will give you a life span of twenty years.\"The dog said, \"That's a long time to be barking. How about only ten years and I'll give you back the other ten?\"So God agreed.On the second day, God created the monkey and said, \"Entertain people, do tricks, and make them laugh. For this, I'll give you a twenty-year life span.\"The monkey said, \"Monkey tricks for twenty years? That's a pretty long time to perform. How about I give you back ten like the dog did?\"And God agreed.On the third day, God created the cow and said, \"You must go into the field with the farmer all day long and suffer under the sun, have calves and give milk to support the farmer's family. For this, I will give you a life span of sixty years.\"The cow said, \"That's kind of a tough life you want me to live for sixty years. How about twenty and I'll give back the other forty?\"And God agreed again.On the fourth day, God created humans and said, \"Eat, sleep, play, marry, and enjoy your life. For this, I'll give you twenty years.\"But the human said, \"Only twenty years? Could you possibly give me my twenty, the forty the cow gave back, the ten the monkey gave back, and the ten the dog gave back; that makes eighty, okay?\"\"Okay,\" said God. \"You asked for it.\"So that is why for our first twenty years, we eat, sleep, play, and enjoy ourselves. For the next forty years, we slave in the sun to support our family. For the next ten years, we do monkey tricks to entertain the grandchildren. And for the last ten years, we sit on the front porch and bark at everyone.Life has now been explained to you.             Backwoodshome.com"},

I used regular spelt grain, added 1/3 chopped roasted red peppers, 1/3 cup sliced green olives, 8 oz. of tomato packed large sardines (I like better than tuna), and used a similar artichoke spread. I followed the rest of the recipe. I also added 6 oz. of drained, water packed artichoke chunks, some garlic powder and thyme. It was great topped with some shredded romano on top.

Rosie was still when I took these- heat to butt! Ellie laid and let out a loud egg song a few minutes later. I went to get the egg, and Rosie was sitting on top of it!

It's been raining most of the afternoon, and now it's pouring. All the snow is gone, sadly. It does make for an easier commute however! The good news for many local ski area workers is that Bogus Basin (our small local ski area) opened yesterday! Lots of new snow, and it was their latest opening date ever.

Then I read this, which really reaffirmed my decision. The \"appetite-stimulating properties\" are really scary, unless you're built like a triathlete!!! If you read the article, you'll have some more interesting information to make an informed decision about what you want to eat. I love spelt, so it's a good substitute! Makes a great pizza crust and bread. Modern Wheat Really Isn't Wheat At AllGluten intolerance is no longer a fringe medical concept. Researchers are fully aware there is a very big problem with modern wheat cultivation. Wheat is far from being a health food. It makes you fat, causes gas and makes your intestinal tract your enemy, or rather vice-versa. High-yielding and now genetically modified varieties of wheat are making this one cereal grain you'll probably want to axe from your food list.So how--and when--did this ancient grain become such a serious health threat? Author and preventive cardiologist William Davis, MD, says it's when big agriculture stepped in decades ago to develop a higher-yielding crop. Today's \"wheat,\" he says, isn't even wheat, thanks to some of the most intense crossbreeding efforts ever seen. \"The wheat products sold to you today are nothing like the wheat products of our grandmother's age, very different from the wheat of the early 20th Century, and completely transformed from the wheat of the Bible and earlier,\" he says. Plant breeders changed wheat in dramatic ways. Once more than four feet tall, modern wheat--the type grown in 99 percent of wheat fields around the world--is now a stocky two-foot-tall plant with an unusually large seed head. Dr. Davis says accomplishing this involved crossing wheat with non-wheat grasses to introduce altogether new genes, using techniques like irradiation of wheat seeds and embryos with chemicals, gamma rays, and high-dose X-rays to induce mutations. In July 2009, the most hated company in the world Monsanto, announced new research into GM wheat and industry groups kicked their promotion of GM wheat into high gear. \"Widespread farmer and consumer resistance defeated GM wheat in 2004 and this global rejection remains strong, as demonstrated by today's statement,\" said Lucy Sharratt, Coordinator of the Canadian Biotechnology Action Network.\"In 2004, a coalition of Japanese consumer and food industry groups delivered a petition to the Governments of Canada and the U.S. urging them not to introduce GM wheat. Today, consumer rejection of GM wheat in Japan is just as strong as ever. 80 organizations in Japan have already signed the rejection statement,\" said Keisuke Amagasa of the Tokyo-based No! GMO Campaign. \"A large majority of consumers here in Japan are voicing their strong opposition to the cultivation of GM wheat. We see strong opposition from all sectors of society.\"Japan's flour companies are also rejecting GM wheat, echoing consumer opposition. In a statement released today, the Flour Miller's Association of Japan wrote to the No! GMO Campaign indicating its opposition. \"Under the present circumstances, with all the doubts about safety and the environment that the consumers in Japan have, including the effect on the human body from GM foods, GM wheat is included among the items that are not acceptable for the Japanese market,\" Kadota Masaaki, senior managing director of the Flour Miller's Association wrote to the No! GMO Campaign.Clearfield Wheat, grown on nearly 1 million acres in the Pacific Northwest and sold by BASF Corporation--the world's largest chemical manufacturer--was created in a geneticist's lab by exposing wheat seeds and embryos to the mutation-inducing industrial toxin sodium azide, a substance poisonous to humans and known for exploding when mishandled, says Dr. Davis. This hybridized wheat doesn't survive in the wild, and most farmers rely on toxic chemical fertilizers and pesticides to keep the crops alive. So what does all of this plant science have to do with what's ailing us? Intense crossbreeding created significant changes in the amino acids in wheat's glutenproteins, a potential cause for the 400 percent increase in celiac disease over the past 40 years. Wheat's gliadin protein has also undergone changes, with what appears to be a dire consequence. \"Compared to its pre-1960s predecessor, modern gliadin is a potent appetite stimulant,\" explains Dr. Davis. \"The new gliadin proteins may also account for the explosion in inflammatory diseases we're seeing.\"An intolerance to gluten can cause a wide array of symptoms, some debilitating. Moreover, delays in diagnosis or common misdiagnoses can be devastating to long-term health. Gerta Farber elaborates on her research and personal experience with Celiac disease.A powerful little chemical in wheat known as 'wheat germ agglutinin' (WGA) which is largely responsible for many of wheat's pervasive, and difficult to diagnose, ill effects. Researchers are now discovering that WGA in modern wheat is very different from ancient strains. Not only does WGA throw a monkey wrench into our assumptions about the primary causes of wheat intolerance, but due to the fact that WGA is found in highest concentrations in \"whole wheat,\" including its supposedly superior sprouted form, it also pulls the rug out from under one of the health food industry's favorite poster children.Below the radar of conventional serological testing for antibodies against the various gluten proteins and genetic testing for disease susceptibility, the WGA “lectin problem” remains almost entirely obscured. Lectins, though found in all grains, seeds, legumes, dairy and our beloved nightshades: the tomato and potato, are rarely discussed in connection with health or illness, even when their presence in our diet may greatly reduce both the quality and length of our lives.The appetite-stimulating properties of modern wheat most likely occurred as an accidental by-product of largely unregulated plant breeding methods, Dr. Davis explains. But he charges that it's impact on inflammatory diseases may have something to do with the fact that, in the past 15 years, it's been showing up in more and more processed foods. Wheat ingredients are now found in candy, Bloody Mary mixes, lunch meats, soy sauce, and even wine coolers. As if making you hungrier wasn't enough, early evidence suggests that modern wheat's new biochemical code causes hormone disruption that is linked to diabetes and obesity. \"It is not my contention that it is in everyone's best interest to cut back on wheat; it is my belief that complete elimination is in everyone's best health interests,\" says Dr. Davis, \"In my view, that's how bad this thing called 'wheat' has become.\"Replace Wheat With SpeltSpelt is an ancient grain that has lately made a comeback in North America, even though it has been popular through the decades in many European countries. Spelt is a non-hybrid distant relative to present day wheat. Spelt's uniqueness is derived from its genetic makeup and nutrition profile. Spelt has high water solubility, so nutrients are easily absorbed by the body making it easy to digest. It is high in protein (significantly higher than wheat), higher in B complex vitamins, and spelt is high in both simple and complex carbohydrates. These complex carbohydrates are an important factor in blood clotting and stimulating the body's immune system. Spelt is a suberb fiber resource. Spelt's nutty flavor doesn't just taste good, it has so many other nutritional benefits that are amazingly good for you! Keep reading to find out more about how spelt’s nutrients contribute to lower risk of cardiovascular (heart) disease, type II diabetes, and can lessen occurrences of migraine headaches. Spelt is more difficult to process than modern wheat varieties, making it a little more expensive to purchase. Spelt's husk protects it from pollutants and insects which allows growers to avoid using pesticides, unlike other grains. The husk needs to be mechanically separated from the kernal before milling (this is done after it is thrashed and harvested). The spelt is stored in good, low moisture conditions in order to protect the kernal, retain nutrients, and maintain freshness. Over decades, modern wheat has been drastically changed to be easier to grow and harvest. This in turn increases yields, maintains a high gluten content in the wheat to produce high-volume commercial baked goods. On the other hand, spelt has preserved many of its original traits and continues to remain highly nutritious and full of flavor. And spelt can make fantastic breads and delicious pastries A note about gluten: Keep in mind that spelt does contain gluten. Gluten is made up of glutenin and gliadin molecules. Gluten provides elasticity to dough, which allows bread to rise. Even though spelt’s gluten is more fragile than other wheats, the bread produces fewer air pockets, it is well formed and maintains its flavorful taste.  From- Preventdisease.comSpelt Salad!- Looks yummy! Recipe here- I'll try soon: thekitchn.com"},

Not bad!The \"good news\" about food allergies- I decided to see a nutritionist, a part of our Employee Assistance Program (free up to six visits), to clean up my diet and lose weight. A good time for me to do this. So far, I'm happy to say, I'm losing weight easily, and down 7 lbs. I'm sticking with whole foods, no \"diet anything\". I was shown this website (all free) and it really helps- fatsecret.com/  It has a database of 1000's of items that are already listed- all kinds of grocery and restaurant items. You can also add foods as needed. It helps track and calculate your food, no guessing, or writing it on a piece of paper. My husband started using it too, as he needs to lose a small amount. The great thing about a nutritionist is that you can tailor the food you eat for what works for YOU. No sales pitch- join this, buy that. This is working, and I can feel this difference already. Other Really Good News- I got a call last month- \"your mammogram shows something, you need to come back in\".

I found another onion soup pot (to go with my other 2), a French butter keeper, and a Polish folk art marmelade (European spelling) pot. All: a whopping $1.50! A French butter keeper is preety cool in function! The round top holds 1 cube of butter perfectly, then the bottom fills about 1/3 with cold water. You then set the butter into the water base. Seals out the air and keeps in cool, no electricity needed! Works great in the summer!!! Just wash weekly, or more often, and you can change the water every few days if needed. No more cold, hard butter or melted goo!Scandinavian Craft and Cooking Books- I found some great books at the library over winter break all with great ideas, recipes and photos:Swedish Christmas Crafts   Not just for Christmas, IMO.                                                  Scandinavian Classic Baking  OMG, what a find!

{"title": "Happy New Year- Time to Reflect", "date": "Dec 28, 2011", "text": "﻿Sometimes in the hustle and bustle of life it's easy to lose track of the really important things in life. The old saying \"if you don't have your health, you've got nothing\" seems pretty true right now. My husband was reading a family Christmas letter he got yesterday (they always send them late!) detailing who got married, who had kids, who moved, who died. As you get older, you start seeing that \"gone\" list more. We are getting to be elders in our expanding little tribe.Every time I get a yearly physical, I hold my breath. While I feel fine, you never know what can be lurking. When everything comes back good, you breathe a sigh of relief. I've started seeing others infirmity more clearly around in our tribe- the one with Parkinson's and Alzheimer's, and his caretaker stressing. The one's who forget to close the dishwasher door when their guests are in town, too distracted to notice. Do they do that when they don't have guests? The cancer survivor, who bounced back. The older ones fixing up a place and I wonder- what will happen if one passes or becomes unable to help? Who will pick up the pieces? I'm very glad Dave and I downsized our home and simplified our lives five years ago. If a major complication arose, we, or each of us individually, would be fine. Sometimes those tough decisions earlier give you a sense of peace later, and it all makes sense. Sometimes the tribe leaves me scratching my head, and that's okay. I just watch from another angle and let it unfold. Sometimes distance gives you perspective. When we went to Portland recently to see Dave's large, extended family for an early holiday gathering, we went to Willamette National Cemetery. Three of our parents are buried there, and my father has a marker, as he wanted to be cremated. It was wet and muddy, but beautiful. It was very busy being expanded, I'm sure due to the war and the aging veteran population. Both my parent served in the Navy during WW2. Dave's father served in the Army during the same time. It's a beautiful facility. As we walked along a narrow road I thought of how much nature surrounded the place, when 3 beautiful deer crossed the grass ahead of us. I smiled. Life goes on, even in a cemetery..."},

IKEA Trip- I did make my first ever trip to an IKEA store, as they built it after we left Portland, of course. I picked up a new set of white dishes, a great price, and some various kitchen goods- new dish towels, a table runner, a 2-sided grater, winter napkins that have cross-stitch snowflakes (cute!), winter cookie cutters, gooseberry and lingonberry preserves (big chunks of fruit!),  a juicer (with 2 sizes for large and small- love the Swedes!), herring, and Swedish meatballs. I'm grateful that I was able to get this much due to an unexpected bonus on our paychecks! Good timing, and my dishes especially were pretty beat up. I will say, I love their prices and variety. I could get lost in there though, it's huge!I mentioned to someone how much I enjoyed the IKEA displays of tiny rooms, and their use of space. She replied- yeah, it's great if you're in college. Oh well, some people still live large in a shrinking and aging world. To each their own. I was glad to come home to our relatively energy-efficient, warm, cozy home, and firm bed! I see aging people who are in large homes, and wonder what will happen when they are gone and their children have to deal with things? The debt involved, not to mention the work? Life happens so fast, and you can't always plan for it...Going into the new year I'm grateful for my family, friends, and health (except the recent bout).

Kinda makes you reflective, but not TOO much.﻿ One of our school foster Grandma volunteers is turning 90 on my birthday! I asked her today what's she's doing on her special day? She told me about her family coming in from out of town for a big dinner and visit. I thought to myself- they probably think she won't be around much longer. She's so \"spry\", active and funny! I told her today that I hope when I turn 90 I'm in good shape like her! She's so tiny, about 5' tall, 80 lbs. dripping wet. Last winter when the parking lot was icy or snowy, I'd walk her from her car across the parking lot to the front covered sidewalk. She told me how scared she was of falling and getting hurt. I told her, no problem, I'm out here on morning bus duty anyway. I'd see her pull into the parking lot and meet her. She really appreciated that. It's those little things that make you bond with someone. For me- out for dinner Sat. night with the kids for Japanese food. Winter Blowing In- The wind is really howling now: 40mph+ and cold. Supposed to about 17 tomorrow morning. I always feel like an animal burrowing in for winter- putting on the flannel sheets, putting the garden to bed. Then, I have to go OUT- get out the warm coats, hats, mittens, etc. Last year it was close to 0 degrees for a week. During my morning bus duty at school I had polar fleece gloves inside my heavy duty mittens, a heavy coat, polar fleece socks inside snow boots. Standing on concrete that cold stinks, BUT I'm grateful I have the those warm items. My heavy duty winter coat is about 9 years old, but looks, and works, great! I have to rave about it, if anyone wants to get one (off season is great time for much cheaper price) - it's the \"Insulated Squall Parka\" from Land's End. Just throw in the washer and dryer! Lots of pockets, and very wind proof. When I see some people who won't dress for the weather, then complain about being cold, I just smile... and hope for snow!!!                                        Mine's redSamantha loves snow too!"},

And remember that in the darkness the light always returns, and hope prevails...After posting my recent blog on Materialism in America, it fits right in. I always enjoy going to a local Unitarian church for their annual Solstice gathering, every December 21st. All the lights are off going in, everything lit by candle, and silent. After a short invocation on reflection in the darkest time of the year, it's silent for several minutes. It's such a wonderful way, as a group, to reflect on your challenges of the last year. Everyone has their own history. Each person is given a candle to put in a large sand table. Each has the option to verbally share (or not) what they wish to release, and their hopes for next year. Each person can go up, one at a time, and light their candle, and speak their peace quietly. It's so lovely. Hearing some of the stories of profound loss, and joy, is truly a thing of grace. And then it spoken about the coming of the light, the days lengthening, and it truly is a magical moment. It hearkens back to ancient times of northern European people celebrating return of the light. It reminds me of the Scandinavian holiday of St. Lucia-                         December 13th is the celebration of St Lucia, a festival widely celebrated across Scandinavia. The eldest girl in each family wears white robes, wear a crown of candles, carry candles, and sing the hymn about St. Lucia. The candles symbolise the fire that couldn't take St. Lucia's life when she was sentenced to be burned.  A Catholic festival now, most think this tradition survived in Scandinavia as it is celebrated during the very darkest days of winter.Back in the days when Yule was celebrated at Winter Solstice, it was both a season of giving, kindness and celebration. For some it was also a season of fear of the earth's dark forces. The scariest night  was called the Night of Lussi, Lussinatta.  Some felt that the festival of light is from this time to fend off the evil forces. I find it's a lovely tradition and serve some Scandinavian food during the December holiday season to take part in my own way, welcoming the light..."},

Hubby drinks it rarely and I just don't like it. Except in bread! I did buy Fat Tire, as I knew he'd have at least one with it sitting there. I love beer bread it in the winter- fast, easy and great loaded with herbs, especially with a hearty soup. That's the menu for tonite- sausage/veggie soup with homemade bread.I googled \"herb beer bread recipe\" and found this on a farm girl's blog! Farmgirlfare.com Easy Beer BreadI'm going to try a variation of her W.W. bread, a cross between the \"easy\" and W.W. I followed the W.W., but added 2 TB dried chives, 1 tsp. dried celery seed, 2 tsp. dried dill, 1 cup regular tillamook (my fave) cheddar cheese. I did have to add a little more beer, since it was a pretty heavy batter. I sprinkled the top with sea salt. Looks good in the pan! For Dessert- I thawed 2 qt. bags of my homegrown, organic nectarines for a pie. My freezer was jammed! We're thinking of looking for a small freezer next summer for the garage, for all the home produce, etc. I'm never very good with lattice, and at the end of the day, my little heart-shaped cookie cutter worked fine.

We put all our backyard stuff in the shed prepping for the weather change. Kind of battening down the hatches. After seeing the big October snow storm back east the last two days, makes me glad I pay attention and watch the weather. Some people just don't. Sometimes they pay for that. I have been cleaning and filling my oil lamps for winter too. I like to keep them in case of outages and they add a nice ambiance- I inherited one of the little oil lamps from my beloved aunt, and found an exact match (except for the chimney) on eBay!

Today was a great way to see the birds out flying on a beautiful fall day-All the birds flown are unable to be in the wild, due to imprinting on people. Many were found abandoned or were part of a breeding program, and would not survive in the wild. Here's a nice shot in their garden pond area-  World Series Baseball-  I'm not a big sports fan, with too much commercialism, a general lack of ethics and the \"tits sell beer\" mentality. And don't ask me about the BSU Broncos- I am SO sick of the team. Being in the wrong league, it's win, win, win. Give them some bigger teams, well it wouldn't be pretty. BUT I do follow the World Series every year, just the finals. It's great to watch the two best baseball best teams in the U.S. play each other!

Here's my answer- I keep my purchases in check by being REALLY selective about what I buy. I don't get into the pack rat mode, or like to over decorate. Some people have collections (some seen in MJF magazine) that would make me feel claustrophobic. Ever inch covered with something. I clean out my closets and decorations every year or so. I come from more of a voluntary simplicity mode. When we downsized our home after our 3 kids went off to college, I had to really purge things. It was actually a relief to have so much less. We actually are starting to have empty garage shelves, I love it! I try to remember that I own my stuff, my stuff doesn't own me.

You gotta be optimistic when you're a gardener, right?Chicken Sun Room Addition- After the heavy snow that stayed on the ground last winter, and bitter cold (0 degrees) I decided we needed to add a \"sun room\" to the coop. Something we can dis-assemble in the spring, remove and store. It will add more light and room for the girls to stretch their legs. I got the idea here: Sun Room I love their website by the way! We started buying some materials yesterday and today, mostly recycled. My husband Dave is in the building process today, since the weather is decent. He designed the front, main screened wall to fit with a shower door, thinking we could add one later, for winter. We got a perfect fit yesterday, for free. Instead of covering the area with plastic (even clear is somewhat opaque) it will have nice, clear glass. Dual-pane to boot! I LOVE recycling!!! Our sun room in progress- Once it's installed and I paint the wood, it should look pretty good, and be nice and sturdy for the winter. We're adding an emergency door, in case one of the girls gets sick or injured. Always gotta have access. It will almost double the square footage and be nice and sunny.

I had been thinking the other day about the Farmers Almanac too and how, in the \"old days\" people had been more in touch with their local weather patterns. The old \"I feel it in my bones, storm's coming\", or me, I try to pay attention to what the squirrels are doing. If they seem to be burying nuts early in the summer, usually seems to be a bad winter, more stormy and snowy. Boise used to have very dry winters, and cold and sunny, snow in the hills and mountains, nothing down here. The last several years have been getting more heavy snow storms here (which I love personally), and it's on the ground longer. Also colder, we had some 0 degree days for a week or more last winter. I personally think, from what I've read, that it's tied into climate change- more N.W. storms and more severe. The snow is great for the ski areas, but tough on the city- not enough snow equipment, and people don't know how to drive in it. They won't slow down, and think that 4-wheel drive is a miracle and somehow levitates them. We see more suvs upside down in the news, and off the road than regular cars. I keep waiting for people to wise up and slow down, and leave early. Bad winters are another good reason to keep my pantry stocked!"},

I had a beautiful loaf of w.w. oat bread rising late last Sunday afternoon, when, bam, oven died. And not the OVEN, but the \"microprocessor\" that runs it. Since we had bought the house 5 years or so ago, with the electric, glass-topped, double oven in it, I used it happily. The double oven was really handy during the holidays, and big baking ventures. We priced the replacement unit and then got sticker shock $525.00- $600.00+ ouch. Since the oven was getting older it didn't make much sense to us to fix it. We opted to buy a new one, with a single oven, for less than the PART. I wished we could have gotten a gas range, but the plumbing fees wouldn't have made it cost effective. It was delivered this morning, and the old one went to oven heaven. Happy retirement for you my friend! I'm happy we had an account with a big box store to cover the purchase, 12 months no interest. We could swing that. I wished we could have bought a good, used one but we needed a reliable stove...At least the new one has some storage below, a bonus for me, with our smaller kitchen!More Recipes-From ﻿Mennonite Girls Can CookButtermilk Herb Dressing-2/3 cup mayonnaise 1/2 cup buttermilk 1 garlic clove, minced 1 Tablespoon fresh dill, chopped 1 Tablespoon fresh Parsley chopped 1 Tablespoon chopped fresh chives 1 teaspoon seasoned salt (NO!) Too salty already IMO pepper to tasteBlend mayonnaise and buttermilk in a jar or shaker Add fresh herbs. salt and pepper Shake or blend well. Store in refrigerator until needed.I doubled the recipe, and I found it needed NO salt, and it was a little too mayo tasting for me. So I doubled the buttermilk, 1 tablespoon of sugar to taste, and 50% more garlic. Great! In the fridge, chilling for tonite.Great Sardini Spread Recipe- A couple of years ago I was looking for some recipes made with sardines, since they're so healthy and I like them. THIS recipe is NOT fishy tasting, you gotta taste it! It's an Italian recipe I found online, and I modified it a bit. I think it was from a restaurant in Seattle. Pretty simple, make it and serve on top of a slice of broiled, crispy baguette bread. Great for lunch!Start with a can of large sardine in tomato sauce, usually found in the mexican cooking section in our grocery store.1- 15 oz can (or 2 small cans) tomato sauce packed sardines1 cup diced green, stuffed olives1 cup diced kalamata olives3 tablespoons mayo, mixed with 2-3 tablespoons blackened fish seasoning (to taste, it's spicy)1/4 cup diced red onion1/4 chopped flat leaf parsley.Drain sardine liquid into mixing bowl with mayo mixture. De-bone sardines, easy to do since they're big, usually just the spine bone. Put in bowl, add olives, onion and parsley. Toss till mixed. Broil slices of baguette with a little olive oil (or plain), top with spread, enjoy! Great on that crunchy bread. The original recipe called for cherry tomatoes, which I left out, since I can't buy local off season, and I added the parsley, cause I love it! You could add diced celery, roasted red peppers, etc. as you like. Best served after it sits overnight...Got A Lot Of Eggs And Tomatoes?

Cook, turning tomatoes occasionally, until softened, 10 to 20 minutes; add more water, 1/4 cup at a time, if mixture starts to get dry (you should see juices around tomatoes).3.

{"title": "More Canning and Apple Butter", "date": "Sep 4, 2011", "text": "I finished the apples today, all of them! Woop, woop! I wound up with 6 more qts. of spiced applesauce and 2 smaller jars. I have about 1 qt. or so of apple  butter that's done, just needs to be canned. It's SO much better than the store bought. We did a side by side test- the store bought has corn syrup and corn sweetener, and has the icky aftertaste. The homemade used lemon juice, sugar, spices and some of the apple cooking water. I used an immersion blender after it has been simmering for hours, very silky. I used my french enamelled cast iron pot, works great at low temps, no scorching. Reduced to about 1/2, delish! I'll do small jars for me and  a few for my kids..."},
{"title": "Canning Applesauce, Tapas Plate Dinner, New Cookbook!", "date": "Sep 3, 2011", "text": "Canning Applesauce Today- I was SO happy it was cool today, only in the low 80's. I had only canned pickles so far, with store-bought cukes. Now it was time for home grown apples!!! I spent about 3 hours this afternoon processing 1/2 of all the apples from our tree. I don't remember the variety I planted, but it was our first harvest, since we had frosts several years in a row, that killed the blossoms. It's a good red/green eating and baking apple. I decided not to wait another week for more ripening, since the tree was taking a beating from the weight of the fruit, even propped up. I also had the 3 day wekend, so good time to can. We wound up with 10 gallons of apples, total. Less than I thought, but all organic! I was happy, after eating one this morning that they were riper than I thought- crunchy, crisp and nice flavor! Anyone recognize the variety? Gala?Cooked til soft, then processed with my new Roma strainer/processor. I had decided with 2 fruit trees, would be a goods investment. Sounds simple to operate, BUT they forgot to mention to cook til really soft. The strainer came off several times with the first batch, and I didn't know to really tighten the thumb screw with pliers til really tight, since it holds on the screen. Duh. I used the \"salsa\" screen first, but the seeds came thru, so switched to the next smaller sauce screen, since we like our applesauce more chunky. Next time will be faster since I know the routine. Atleast I didn't break it!!!Worked great! I cooked the 2nd batch of apples a little longer, perfect! I also ran the leftovers thru a 2nd time, and got a lot more sauce. The hens got the rest, OMG, now THAT was funny! Chicken applesauce. They attacked it with relish.Then I cooked it with a small amount of fresh lemon juice, sugar and cinnamon, brought to a boil and processed. My husband did the taste test, excellent! He hugged me :)  His Mom used to can a lot so he appreciates the effort put in. He liked the way it the processor cut down on the labor, since she had to hand do everything - skinning, seeding, etc. 4 quarts and 1-12 oz. jar. That was 1/2 the apples, but with a lot of wormy spots I had to remove. Tomorrow's batch is the better apples, so I'm thinking about 6 or 7 qts. or more. And it's very thick, even with some water added. I also have started freezing seasonal produce from the store. In the dead winter red and green bell peppers run about $1.00- $1.50 or more each, so I bought several at $.49 each last week- washed, dryed, seeded, sliced and threw in the freezer. I am still picking our fresh blackberries and freezing them too. Haven't decided if I'll make jam or just use for muffins, pies, etc....Tapas Dinner In-I knew I'd be busy today, so I planned a nice, cold dinner in advance. I use this recipe (sorry no time to type it out) and it's good! I love the chickpea salad, good with anything, or by itself! I subbed purple onion for the scallions, or use green onions. I also added about 1/4 diced celery. I always double the salad recipe since it's great, and keeps well. I think it's better the second day. Our local discount grocery store sells the nice, mixed french olives now, yum. I found the recipe last year in a magazine (Sunset?)- just chill the salad before serving.And my new cookbook! I loved The Lost Art Of Pie Making so much, I had to get another by the same author! Love her series so far. I'll try the Swedish Orange Rye Bread next...Nice End to The Day- We ended the day with a trip to Baskin Robbins, with Sam, our aging dog. Too far to walk to the park, so we stopped there on the way back with our ice cream and boy, did she RUN! The Aussie part of her loved it. I haven't seen her run that much in a while, it's been so hot, and she's getting arthritis. She was rested when she got there, so bam, she ran circles around us. How cute. Then, she ran out of gas a bit later. She loved the ride home, crashed out in back seat of our wagon. She took a long nap when she got home. Good girl Sam... Mommy loves you...﻿"},

BUT I appreciate my A/C as well, and that I can water my garden without having to stay in the heat afterwards. The dog and hens are so hot. I give the \"girls\" a pan of ice chips in the late afternoon once I get home from work, and on the weekend. The older one loves them, the 2 younger can't figure out what it's for! I dont' leave the dog out too much, as she's getting a bit older and takes her longer to recover from the heat. Poor Sam.... I also appreciate being out of the way of major storms and hurricanes... and a lot of fires in the area around us in the mountains and rural hills.Blackberries are really coming in, so I'm freezing some. Once they're all in I'll make some organic blackberry jam. I found one recipe with lime juice, sounds tangy! I'm getting a good, steady supply of tomatoes too. I bought some gourmet pizza dough on the way home tonite, a lb. for $2.00. Made a whole layer of garden tomatoes sliced thin, with lots of herbs, covered with mozzarella, purple onions, kalamata olives, and goat cheese blobs. Topped with fresh basil after it was baked. Amazing! I'm going to use my baby tomatoes, and my new chopper to make some fresh salsa tomorrow. Simple recipe I created, will post with photos...Apples are getting close too. I decided (for now) I'm going to pick them all, even if they're a bit green, so I can process them over Labor Day weekend. It's a lot of apples. Glad I bought my food strainer- just cook, dump em in, and it sorts out the skins and seeds. A few different screen sizes for variety. It's a Roma brand I think, similar to the big one they sell on Lehman's. I'll post pics when I get into the processing. Will mostly do applesauce, apple butter (love the stuff), and some slices for pies. I decided to do my plain, as I like the option of doing pies, tarts, and apple cakes. Nectarines will be a bit behind, luckily, so will do those when they're ripe. Three weeks maybe??? I don't think I'll have enough jars, ah well... back to the store...I found this great blog! Mennonite Girls Can Cook  Great recipes and photos. I love their group photo at the top of the page with matching aprons, cute!And yes, I want this sink! Maybe the kitchen too!!!"},

I did also add 1 teaspoon of pure orange extract, and a pinch of salt. Anything I bake that calls for sugar gets a pinch of salt if there's none in the recipe. Grandma taught me that.Thin milk mixture on left, egg whites on rightin the crust ready to bake, kind of a fluffy mixture, not like a custardPhoto of finished pie-Will let you know how it tastes later, but smells very citrusy... The pie \"done\"- a layer of custard about 2/3 the way up, then very moist cake: Flavor's very good, maybe a tad too sweet, glad I added the orange extract. My pie pan was 10\", so I might do the recipe 1 1/2 xs to top it off.

Lots of nectarines starting to turn color. Atleast they won't ripen at the same time as the apples, I hope! I see LOTS of applesauce, apple butter, apple slices for pies, yum. Right next to the pickles I made. Hot- It's been hot lately, 100 a few days ago, too hot. Water, water, water, but 0 weeds in the veggie garden! The hens are doing an amazing job at weed control. I had to tie up the tomatoes again, since they're so full of fruit. I love sauteed tomatoes with herbs on top of pasta, or homemade pizza crust, perfect for a summer meal.Day Tripping- We went to McCall yesterday, hubby, I and grown daughter, had a blast! Up in the mountains about 2 hours from here. We stopped on the way up at a farmers market, and got 2 baskets of  gorgeous local strawberries (amazing flavor) and a bag of fresh corn. I made a strawberry pie today, and one mixed with blackberries. They came out perfect! Payette Lake is so beautiful up there in McCall. Much cooler, about 72. We had lunch, did some thrift store shopping (of course) and I found two amazingly beautiful pillow shams for $1.50 (yes, 75 cents each). Velvet, quilted and really beautiful. Will use in the fall/winter when it gets cold. I'm hoping for a normal fall, not in the 90's in October like last year. Too hot, way too long. We went swimming in Cascade Lake, heading back out of McCall, as there's a great little-used state park there with nice beaches. It was so cool and windy had to keep it short, only about 72. I got a little sunburn, but hey, it was fun! Nice to have a really relaxing day before going back to work Friday. We did run into the tail-end of a fire in the hills, delayed us a bit, but could have been much worse. The fire expanded after we went through and they closed the highway. Good timing for us, as I needed a potty break!Edging color is really more navy blue, I love the embroidery over the velvet, they're like new!My new favorite book- got it today off Amazon- The Lost Art of Pie Making, Made Easy by Barbara Swell. Excellent recipes, many of them very old. And it's updated for current use, with many vintage photos inside too. Lots of used copies, very cheap!Image from the book- Salvation Army girls making free pies each day for soldiers in WW1, 26th division, Ansonville, France, 1918. The bags around their necks are gas masks and they have on steel combat helmets. I LOVE this photo! Gives you a sense of the book. Amazon Link-Lost Art of Pie MakingBread!- I FINALLY mastered the whole wheat sandwich loaf, from Oklahoma Pastry Cloth's website. With Mary Beth's (the site owner) help! It didn't fall in the middle, rose nicely, great crumb. Onto the next version, with lots of nuts and seeds.

{"title": "1st Canning Time- Picklings!", "date": "Aug 12, 2011", "text": "Oh boy, I did my first batch of canning and did pickles today! I did a lot of research for months, and since all of the foods I'm going to can are acid, I bought a steam canner. Before anyone started telling me why they are BAD, I did my research, and I don't always go with what the Feds choose to spend money on researching.  I have been down that road before with supplements :) So please no comments on that, unless you've tried it and have some positive comments! I'd love to hear what you've made!I used the Ball \"Blue Book\" recipe, with the \"kosher style\" variation, since I like spicier pickles. Added red hot pepper slices, red bell pepper slices, bay leaves, mustard seeds. I followed the Ball directions precisely, did all the sterilizing. I have to can outside, since we have a glass top range, no canning there. Our camp stove worked great, brought it to a boil, added hot pack jars, brought to 8\" steam and started the timer. 15 minutes per batch.The 1st batch came out with the pickles floating a little, I assuming I didn't pack tight enough. So I packed them tighter by adding some spears on the 2nd batch. Looked better now that they are done too. I did some small jars, because I wanted them for gifts or giveaways. NEVER again, too hard to pack, live and learn. Luckily I had more quart jars than I thought. The Ball recipe called for 8 lbs. cukes, way too much for the amount of brine. I had to make a 2nd batch of brine, which was okay, since I had enough ingredients. My total was 4 qts. jars and 7 pint jars. Took me about 2 1/2 hours total, not bad for a newbie.Here's the before-  and the after, 1st batch- Man the whole house smells like pickles! I'm cooling off now... and the lids are starting to ping!

My Montgomery Ward sewing machine finally died this last year after many decades of minor repairs, etc. I hadn't really made any clothing since the 80's. Yes, that's dating me, but who cares! I finally broke down and bought a new one after two used ones, in a row, pooped out. I researched in ConsumerReports.org, and read a lot before I chose this one. I got it on Amazon, with free shipping. It's a Singer Heavy Duty 4411. I got the machine yesterday, took the time to read all the directions. Put in fresh needle, aan a couple of sample passes to check stitch length. Worked great! Not sure yet on the \"heavy duty\" aspect, but I assume it'll be ok. I just do mostly straight stitching.  Just wanted to be able to do some heavier fabrics on occasion. The cheaper Singer/Brothers I looked into had lousy reviews. Only complaint so far- lousy lighting! Singer, needs to get some LED lighting on these things! I will have to get a lamp next to it, for evening sewing. In daylight, with overhead on and machine light, not much lighting.I did my first full project today, a summer cotton batik blouse. Worked great, even over areas with 6 layers of fabric and fusible stuff. Nice and even never had to adjust anything! I did a simple v-neck so I didn't have to deal with buttons right off. The pattern has 3 different necklines, so I'm going to make a sleeveless version next, with a keyhole neck. I sewed the whole shirt in about 2 hours, not bad! Back to school next week, good thing I got the machine now, as I will be in a sewing frenzy!  And I can finally tailor some things that are a little too big...Yes, It's Burlap- Years and years ago I started using burlap for table runners, mantle covers, etc. It's all the rage now, apparently :)  I liked it for the texture and low cost. It does require a wash, because it has a distinctive SMELL!  Washed in the gentle cycle, with some softener, threw in the dryer. Nice and soft, and raggedy edge. Just clean out that lint trap, wow it was FULL! It will be off a bit straightness wise, beware. But, hey, it's burlap! $3.00 a yard here.Today I washed my burlap bean bag I emptied, and stuffed it! New pillow!I also added a few new burlap \"ribbons\" I made, to some things I already had to add some texture. I just used a little \"Liquid Nails\" glue on the back to hold it up, and keep them from sliding down-a little hanging basket I got at the grocery store: and a french country topiary I made years ago, changed the paint, added the bow!I'm going to re-use some stuffing from some worn pillows I have and make a new, larger burlap pillow.

{"title": "My Musings on \"Homesteading\" Types", "date": "Aug 5, 2011", "text": "I started following quite a few blogs I discovered this summer, on \"homesteading\". Many of them really inspired me to make good changes in my life! But that can be a broad term, and can mean different thing to different people, so here's a few things I thought of today, the \"types\" of homesteaders I discovered. This is my opinion, so there ya go....* Urban Homesteaders- People like me, who live in the city, and are trying, to varying degrees, to live more- naturally, more mentally/emotionally/spiritually healthier. Use a smaller footprint. We have a relatively small home,  have updated all the insulation, etc. Still using the 30 year old furnace- hey it works! I do have a dishwasher (came with the house), I'm toying with the idea of removing it, and storing it (in case we ever sell the house), and adding some needed shelving under the counter for cookbooks, etc. There's two of us, do we really need a dishwasher? I have A/C, but we have a \"saver\" program from the city attached to it, use ceiling fans in every room, and keep it turned up. We have an urban chicken coop (made from mostly free, recycled materials), organic gardens, use a push mower, try to limit use of our cars, I'll be canning soon, get a lot of my clothes from thrift stores, eBay, and just bought a sewing machine to start making more of my own stuff. I'm starting to embroider, something my Grandma taught me as a kid. Haven't done it in decades, but it's coming back to me. We buy used home improvement items: my kitchen's cast iron sink, (from the SHIP/Habitat building supply thrift store), ditto our front door. We try to be good neighbors, encourage others to be more mindful of their choices, but tolerate it when they don't. We don't expect others to follow our path. I want to move to a rural area and have an acre or two, and be more self sufficient. And we don't sue people when they use the phrase \"urban homesteaders\". You know who you are...*Ruppie Homesteaders- They drive big suv's, go \"antiquing\" on a regular basis, spend, spend, spend. They plant a \"lawn\" on their farms (really?), buy \"designer\" homesteading clothes (really??), obsessively decorate their homes, barns, etc. They drive great distances, burning up huge amounts of gas, to go find that special item. They fly to overpriced, upscale \"junk\" sales. They overly partake of various websites, where others like them go, and \"join\". They earn badges. When I found myself starting to get sucked in, I stopped and \"unliked\" their blogs and websites. They talk about simple living and frugality, but seem to be emotionally invested in decorating their homes to the nth degree and spending. What's BEHIND this? A feeling of a need for approval, to be special, to fill the emotional gaps with stuff or? I find it, frankly, bizarre in a certain way. One person (don't ask me cause I aint telling) has a blog using the name of a textile. At first I thought her blog/home was cute, but the more I looked, the more uneasy I felt, as it was wound up a little too tight. I thought, put her in a room and tell her to meditate, sit down and do nothing. Or go outside and watch the trees. She probably couldn't do it. Reminded me of the \"Stepford Wives\", and of certain groups of religious folks who take high amounts of anti-depressants: \"smile, be happy 24/7, you know you want to.... you supposed to...\"*Simple, Rural Homesteaders- I love these folks! I get great recipes on their blogs, drool over their photos, huge gardens, livestock, and want want to move NOW! I see all the work they do and emotionally support all them, thru their struggles and exhaustion. I daily check some of their blogs, because we're on the same page. Most of them don't blog however, but I know they're out there. These people love their kids, animals and try to be kind to the earth. They practice, and teach, old time skills. They home school, due to remote locations, or other reasons. They help their neighbors and communities. They don't do $200.00 embroidery items from Europe, but needlework on their everyday items. They willingly share knowledge, and they love the support! I salute them! My favorite one right now is-http://pioneerwomanatheart.blogspot.com/    She's awesome! I feel transported when I read her blog...So here's to the homesteaders who are trying to lead authentic lives out there, even when we don't know who you are! Go for it!!!"},

Repeat, folding in the remaining flour mixture by fourths. Pour batter into an ungreased 10-inch tube pan; spread evenly. Bake on the lowest oven rack for 40 to 45 minutes or until the top springs back when lightly touched. Immediately invert cake (leave in pan); cool thoroughly. (If the cake has risen higher than the pan, invert it over a jar or bottle so the top of the cake does not touch the countertop.) To serve, loosen side and center from pan with a narrow spatula; remove cake. Using a serrated knife, cut into wedges. Pinto Beans and Cornbread- For Dinner!Link-  http://thepioneerwoman.com/cooking/2007/08/beans_and_cornb/ Ingredients:     4 cups dried Pinto Beans, 4 slices thick sliced Bacon, salt, pepperNancy Note- This is a very flexible recipe. I added 1/2 a chopped onion, paprika, chili powder, onion powder cayenne, a little fresh chopped cilantro, to taste. A little spicy, but good! Topped with some more cilantro and sour cream. I served with my own buttermilk cornbread and sald, with homegrown tomatoes, yum!Directions: Rinse beans in cool water; pour into a pot, cover with water by 2 to 3 inches. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and cover. Simmer 2-3 hours, or until beans are tender. Add water to pot as needed. Beans should have a thick broth. Toward end of cooking time, add salt and pepper and season to taste. Don’t over-salt. For a variety try adding chili powder, garlic or Tabasco.Pics of angel food cake and w.w. bread. Didn't take pic of beans, sorry!"},

Busy, busy, busy, BUT... I try to remember the benefits of NOT keeping a schedule. I believe in the old adage- when you're dying you won't look back and say \"gee, think of the work I could have gotten done!\" Instead it's about enjoying the time, and doing some \"stuff\". I do plenty of that. And I'm getting a new sewing machine, after two in a row pooped out. So much for used !Having the summers off, I do lots of things I never have time to do otherwise- sit out on the deck with the chickens in my pj's, watch the wid blow thru the trees, watch my dog sleep (again), sleep in, stay up late, read, read, read. And catch on on all the great blogs I discovered this summer! Back to work in three weeks, sigh...And it's about the time to look at/explore my relationships, especially the one with myself. Since it all starts there, you have no where to go, but out. If you can't find peace inside, what's the point?Buffy and Ellie- BIG girls!I had browsed thru Ree Drummond's cookbook, then found her website- lots of free recipes!The Pioneerwoman Website, Or \"I Married a Cowboy, Moved to Oklahoma & Learned to Cook\"AND she's getting her own show-Foodnetwork Announces \"The Pioneer Woman August27th Series Premiere\"I have to say when I saw something about a \"Pioneer Woman\" cooking show, I got REALLY excited, thinking it would be some kind of authentic, historical show, well obviously, not quite. I'd LOVE to see something on some kind of homesteading, historical, Foxfire-ish based show someday, but probably not exactly \"mainstream\"..."},

Great for soaking chicken in before frying, as a salad dressing base, etc. My Grandma used to drink a cold glass, with salt & pepper in the summer! I’d love to hear how to soak the flour!!!It's been busy the last couple of weeks- gardening, deep cleaning house and garage, playing with bread recipes, and learning the various rising magic of \"dough enhancer\", \"vital gluten\", etc. The last batch came out pretty well! The 2nd version I made 2 days ago was better, I made it 2/3 W.W....Garden- With the reasonably mild weather (no steady 90's or 100's yet) the garden is growing fast! Spreading last of the manure today. Starting to pick raspberries, the tomatoes are LOADED! Can't wait for them to ripen. We'll have another huge crop of blackberries too this year. Biggest challenge is the huge maple tree and all the shade. Hoping next spring to get an arborist in and do some damaged branch pruning, and open up the area over the garden. The tree is huge, and we've done what we can, safely. We need some sun!!!  I finally gave up on growing lemon cukes (my fave!) on the ground, not much harvest, so I put them in a hanging basket. They're growing great! We had an old garden \"Shepard's hook\", worked perfect! Food- For breakfast- home grown eggs and homemade bread! Now if I only had an orange tree... Ready to start canning soon!Baby Chicks- The 2 \"babies\"- Ellie (black) and Buffy (buff) have transitioned out into the coop full time. Rosie, our hen, has been a bit twitchy about it, but is finally calming down. The babies are pretty funny, and entertaining! Ellie (named for Ellie in \"Contact\") seems to find worms fast, then Buffy (named for the \"vampire slayer\", & she's a Buff Orpington) who's MUCH bigger, chases her around to take them. More later!"},
