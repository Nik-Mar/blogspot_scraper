this makes doctor no. 3/4) and my sister and I went to see her on Tuesday.  I know that there need to be strict protocols due to Covid, but geezelouise.  There is no phone in her room - which is not a huge problem, as she does not have her hearing aids - we can only see her once a WEEK and we have to make an appointment to do that.  Our 'meetings' are limited to 15 minutes and are attended by a rehab center staff.  Trying to get information or talk to a person has proven to be very frustrating.  We are lucky enough to have a connection to someone who works there, which allowed me to talk to mom last night via the friend's cell phone.  We have an 'appointment' to see her again on Monday afternoon and we hope to break her out of there.Back on the home front, I have been working on cleaning up the garden.  I ended up selling all the stuffies I had knit that were in the salon gift shop and they are clamoring for more.  Oy.  I am trying to get four done by the end of next week and that will have to do.  I have holiday knitting looming.  While I was inside, furiously knitting stuffie parts, my dear neighbor came by to help prepare for winter.  He, apparently, comes from the school of Torched Earth Landscaping.  My lingonberry bushes have disappeared.  I am not sure if Peanut is still recovering or if he's hit his stride in high drama mode.  I am still hoisting him up the steps and into the house.  Slimmie got a new self-heating bed and we haven't seen much of him lately.  My chickens have ceased laying eggs so are now officially classified as freeloaders.  Some good news - my barn has been filled with hay!  Once again, my wonderful farmer neighbor has packed the barn for winter with lovely second cut hay.  At $2.50/bale.  Shhhhh.  Don't spread it around....  This is much appreciated by my ancient llama, who is down to two teeth.  And by me.I started two fermentations this year - carrots and ginger, and curry kraut.  The carrots need more time, but I have to say that the curry kraut is now my favorite!Lastly - for now - I have started up my bread run again.  I flounced into Perrecas and just inhaled.  Then I hyperventilated my way to M's store, making sure the windows were up so that I wouldn't miss an iota of warm bread aroma.  Heaven (and hell, to be honest).  On my maiden drive, I was reminded that I needed all my senses on high alert.  There were deer, school buses, heavy fog, and lunatics behind the wheel.  Ah, Autumn."},

the way they set it up is to have you order online, then you pay when you pick up.  Apparently, they got royally stiffed at the last pick up.  We now have to put payment in an envelope with our name on it.  Really?  This husband/wife team has slaved away for 37 years on this farm to grow wonderful organic produce for us and people think it's fine to not pay them?  I am so steamed.The shearer has not called with a date yet -

Again.  I have been adjusting to being on my own and sorting out the on-taking of my day-to-day chores.  After bidding a tearful goodbye to my middle sis (Peanut and Lovey stared out the window for hours, not believing that she had really gone), I muddled about for a few days.  Most of the activity centered around finding where the girls had relocated kitchen items.  Apparently, I have morphed into an OCD person, having to have my little red handled knives in their place, the water pitcher just so.  While I still have the QE3 (aka walker) and cane at hand, I am slowly and surely starting to get about without accouterments.  I only stagger a little.I have taken on the chicken tending activities and hope to be fully functional by the end of this week, dammit.  I am sure my neighbor will be popping open the bubbly when that happy event occurs.  What a gem.  The only downside is that each appearance of my neighbor (the same neighbor, wearing the same outer clothing, driving the same car) drives the dogs into maniacal throes of barking.  This is especially hard on the nerves when he makes four trips over.  He makes four trips over because he is 85 and does things in steps.  We are now to the point where he only comes once in the morning and as needed for snow removal (it's snowing as I type).  The chickens were happy to see me and I, them.  There's no one like mom.My PT has started and I have a list of exercises to perform at home.  This is a good thing, as we have had ice, snow, sleet, wind and more snow, every other day.  Interspersed with frigid temps.  Our next storm is starting now and building up overnight into tomorrow.  The chances of my making it to PT tomorrow are slim.  I have plenty of food (but no one but me to cook it, boohoo) and, other than PT and a few doctor appointments, there is no reason to leave.As we segue off in a totally different direction....I have been on an off-and-on search for toothpaste that does not involve mint flavoring.  That's led me to children's toothpaste - mango and strawberry; yummo, but a whole lotta sugar.  What's up with that? - to tea tree oil, which was reminiscent of brushing one's teeth in the woods, using a pine branch - to baking soda.  Blech, just blech.  Then, quite by chance, I stumbled on Tom's of Maine's Propolis and Myrrh toothpaste.  I could have turned to their cinnamon flavor, but the sheer oddity of the ingredients attracted my wacky side.  And, let's face it, both of my sides are wacky.  I now enjoy a mystical experience every time I brush my teeth.  Who can ask for more?  As you can surmise, two weeks under constant surveillance and care did not put even the tiniest dent into my own particular (or peculiar) life bubble.  Having solved the toothpaste dilemma, I immediately turned to the pursuit of the perfect pillow.  I have been through buckwheat, foam, foam with gel, bamboo, fiberfil, fiberfil plus.  I feel like the proverbial princess with her pea problem, if you will forgive the reference.  Nothing produced the quality of slumber that I daydreamed about.  One night, a few days before surgery, I grabbed one of the shammed pillows (used just for frou-frou-ness) and shoved it under my head.  Out like a light.  In the morning, waking from a deep and painless sleep, I beheld the feather pillow behind the sham.  I was on my Amazon account before my first cup of coffee and am the happy owner of two pristine goose down pillows.  Let's hope my luck holds but, deep in my heart, I think that pillows are fickle.I am celebrating every day that the minimal pain I enjoy is based on whipping my muscles into shape and not the soul-crushing pain of collapsing hip joints.  I have lots of projects to tackle inside, while I wait for winter to disappear.  I have a garden to plan.  I have retirement to wrap my head around.  I have mountains to climb, ships to sail and lots of knitting projects.  I also have a LOT of catching up to do with friends who keep checking on me, bless 'em."},

I am not Laura Ingalls and, by the time I am done tossing and turning on my fleece or flannel sheets, I would be bound as tightly as a geisha's foot.  And was I ever shocked at the prices!  I much prefer natural fibers - cotton, wool, linen - so I bought one cotton and one cotton blend.  On sale.  With free shipping.  When I slipped on the cotton nightgown, I was immediately reminded of Uncle Fester.  Or, Uncle Fester joins the Army, as it is an Army-like green.  It went from neck to toes in a long, shapeless green tube.  But it is comfy and the dogs could care less about my lack of fashion sense.  The second one was tres chic and I had an overwhelming desire to sashay all over the place.  Until I realized that my present version of 'sashay' is more of a slow, crablike gait, entirely lacking in graceful moves.  I am not sure that this switch in my nightwear allegiance will outlast its present convenience.  It is awfully nice to be able to get ready for bed in minutes, rather than 10s of minutes.  And there is a little Gloria Swansonesqueness (whoa!) about the idea of sashaying around in a nightgown, when my sashay comes back.  Plus, I can always pull on a pair of jeans under the nightgown and go do chores!  Woot!  Woot!"},

{"title": "Mi curtido sabe fantastico!", "date": "Friday, November 20, 2020", "text": "(Translated:  Damn!  My curtido is yummy!)  I finally remembered to check on the progress of my ferments.  I had made a half gallon of sauerkraut and a half gallon of curtido with ONE HALF of the giant cabbage.  This year I decided to go au naturel with my sauerkraut, as opposed to my usual blueberry/caraway seed sauerkraut.  I also decided to try a new curtido recipe, as I wasn't all that thrilled with previous results.  OMG.  It is delicioso!  I got the recipe from the book included in my Mason Fermentation kit.  In addition to the usual carrot/cabbage/red chili of yore, they added grated garlic and oregano.  I love it!  And it's purty.  Since I know y'all can't wait to hear the latest in my social security wranglings, let me say that I found yet another reason to go local.  I laid out my concerns to a local representative of the SSA and she said (to paraphrase), \"well, I wouldn't give the government more money than I have to - it will take forever to get it back.  You'd be better off just going with the flow and it will resolve itself.\"  When I voiced concern over getting cut off because I didn't pay the quarterly bill (there's a slight gap of 2-3 weeks between when the bill is due and when they will be taking Medicare out of my SS payment), she said, \"if they harass you in any way, just call us.\"  So.  I am tackling the insurance issue today with \"Gary\".  I have an appointment with my dermatologist in mid-December and I was dreading finding out if or if not she accepted Humana.  I finally pulled up the BGPs and checked this morning.  Hallelujah!  She does.  Good thing, too.  It takes a year to get an appointment with this woman.  She refuses to use a PA, so it's one doctor to every 5,000 patients.  Crazy pants.I'm trying to find ways to bring the homogenous-ness of my days into some kind of focus.  So far, it's not working out as well as I hoped.  Some of it has to do with the fact that I am unable to do more than one largish task a day.  I cannot tell you how frustrating that is.  Yesterday, it took me an hour to get all my recycling and trash into my car for the trip to the transfer station.  At least they are still taking pity on me and sort everything when I get there.  I am planning a trip to the grocery store today - I figure I will get there when they open so that there will be fewer potential Covid-carriers milling about.  I have a short list, but I will go bonkers if I spend more time in this house.Also on the agenda is:  take down wind chimes, take out compost, vacuum, sweep, clean bathrooms, wash dog blankets.  I can hardly stand the potential thrill of it all.  (sound of dripping sarcasm)  I have had the vacuuming, sweeping and cleaning on the agenda for an alarming amount of time.  I manage to segue off to something totally irrelevant every time I am faced with housework.  Such as waxing the top of Lorenzo, the dining room table.  I may need an intervention.  Or cleaning service.In my defense, at least a little purging has been done - I have tons of books on gardening, homesteading and self-sufficiency type stuff.  Looking to the future - and my tiny home - my library is going to have to be severely curtailed.  I had a big box of books to put on FB marketplace and figured it would be one of those, \"I'd like that ONE and could you deliver it to my house, 30 miles from you?\"  However, it appears that there are a few young families that are taking the plunge, so I ended up with three requests in a row.  Miracle of all miracles, the second family (first one lived 40 miles from me and wanted delivery...) picked it up within an hour of requesting it.  I am going to go through the second batch and will just send them along to the same family."},

Wodehouse's Jeeves and Wooster recordings, with the result that certain expressions have entered into my conversation with alarming regularity - I say!  I trickle in and out.  I \"what ho!\" when entering the house.  Things have become rather fruity.  I better wean myself off this path or I may never look back.I have had a communication from the Mothership (which I prompted, after days of radio silence) and my last day will be Friday, October 9.  We have worked out an amenable separation agreement and I will be glad when it is finally done.  Of course, negotiating my way through Social Security and Medicare has been jolly fun.  There may be a lapse between work coverage and Medicare, but that is how it goes.  I will swaddle myself in bubble wrap and stay put until the coast is clear.I would also like to thank Debby - she who was not only the bright spot in my week, but the sun rising!Pardon me whilst I dash off to cast a critical eyeball on the state of Peanut's talons.A pawdicure is on the near horizon."},

{"title": "New Lists", "date": "Tuesday, September 8, 2020", "text": "Since I've been around the block a few times (and around the sun - figuratively speaking - MANY times), and, since I am of a rather suspicious nature (too many Midsomer Murder viewings), the writing was on the wall as clear as day.  How's that for chock-full of idioms?First - after the company I work for announced that everyone was getting a 20% pay cut, they also informed the support staff that, if they were given a bonus, the bonus would be paid out half up front and the second half at some to-be-announced date at the end of the year.  I received an email from HR informing me that my second half was being paid in August.Second - my supervisor, who apparently thinks I can function with little or no oversight and rarely 'checks in', sent me an email to 'catch up'.Third -  When she got me on the phone, she added HER supervisor.Yes, it's official - my office is being closed and I am being emancipated from my job.  Even though I was not surprised, it still gave me a jolt.  I suppose it was more from the fact that, after over 22 years of working at the same place - through three 'generations' - it was over in less than five minutes.My new list includes:  signing up for Social Security, signing up for unemployment benefits, brushing up my already-created resume (thank you, Michelle), wending my way through the dizzying varieties of supplemental health insurance, tightening my belt, and pulling up my BGPs.Meanwhile, back at the homestead, we've been assailed almost daily by a juvenile red tail hawk.  He or she is completely inept at chicken attacks, thank god.  But I am compelled to rush out on a regular basis to shoo him/her off.  It has also underlined my belief that roosters are not necessary, as everyone lets me know of impending danger.  I lost my last rooster and have no plans to replace him.  Then I lost Dolly - my sweet Swedish Blue/Cayuga duck cross.  It was a total mystery.  That leaves Dimples from the original four ducks.  Luckily, Marianne's male duck is all alone on his pond, so Dimples will be joining him as soon as they reinforce the fence.  While she may not be thrilled with her new boyfriend, she will definitely love the pond.The garden is pretty much finished for the year.  There is the ever-present and abundant kale and the Swiss chard is still limping along.  I have managed to weed out four of the eight beds and hope to finish by the end of this week.  Then starts the process of putting things right before winter.  As I will now have loads of time... I hope I will get more done.  I had hoped to get local peaches and plums, but a late frost wiped out any hope of most stone fruit here.  Then - magically - this arrived in the post:Prune plums from Oregon!  As always, my lovely friend (in every way) had perfect timing.  I whipped up my favorite plum crisp (GF) and made a batch of plum jam.  I have also been taking advantage of the vege bounty (thanks to friends) and have been roasting a big pan of vegetables every week.  It is my favorite way to cook ahead, as you can eat them hot out of the oven, at room temperature, as a cold salad - you can toss them with a light vinaigrette and some feta cheese.  You can roast them with feta cheese.  You can toss them hot with sundried tomato pesto and mix with pasta.  There is no end to the variety of meals one can conjure up.My sister spent the night this past Friday and she helped me wash the dogs the next morning.  Since Peanut counts her as his favorite human in the world, she can do anything to him and he goes along willingly.  While Lovey never smells bad, Peanut is a hot, sweaty little being and gets a little 'ripe' after  a while.  They now smell like lavender and cedar.Best of all, the last reminder of the Great Quail Fiasco has left the homestead.  It will now house rabbits on a homestead to the south of me.  As another plus, two bags of fleece found a home with a spinner who is interested in adding more Cormo/CormoX sheep to her flock.  As it happens, I have a CormoX that I would LOVE to rehome (are you listening, Norman?)  Fingers crossed.  So, off I go to contemplate my navel, attend another useless Zoom meeting, and try to figure out what I want to do with the rest of my life.P.S.

{"title": "Got a match?", "date": "Monday, August 10, 2020", "text": "If it wasn't for the tomatoes... I would torch my garden.  It does make me feel the tiniest bit better knowing that everyone around me is having a very 'off' year, too.  After a little spurt of productivity, all eighty of my summer squash plants pooped out.  After an exciting start with abundant vines, glorious yellow blossoms and baby squash, my Kuri plants died.  My cucumber plants withered.  Even with electronet fencing, there is a little, skinny rabbit that hops in and out of the garden, eating off the tops of the Swiss chard, chewing up the sunflowers, mowing the beans.  But, all is not lost!  I have a splendiferous, glorious, bumper crop of WEEDS!  (Drip, drip, drip goes the sarcasm.)  Between the drought and my wonky hip(s), I have not been able to keep up with them.  As if that is ever a possibility - even in good times.I'm trying to decide if it's worth it to weed the kale and onion beds (don't even get me started on the onion 'crop') or just turn my back on it all, reap what I can and then smother the beds over the winter.  It's very disheartening.  Last week, I had to cover for my counterpart in the city, which meant that I had to trek into the office every day so that I could cover her attorney's phone - for that one call a day.  In some ways, it was nice to get away from the house, but in most ways, I am so glad I do not have to commute.  There is also construction going on in the office below me, which seems to require super-heavy-duty dental equipment (whining drills), a jack hammer, lots of metal ladders and whoknowswhat.  You can't hear yourself think.We've had a brief hiatus from the hotashell weather - over as of yesterday and back into heat advisories - so I marooned myself on the Island of Misfit Stuffies and made more progress on my secret SOYSOX project, details to be revealed at a later date.  I will recount my adventures on the IOMS in my next post.There were some highlights over the past week(s) - my friend, Marianne, opened her general store, Hoosick Provisions, to rave reviews.  It is a lovely space filled with wonderful things and they have been busy as all get-out since they opened their door. There was also a little pre-birthday celebration with three of the four 'girls' at my favorite restaurant.  It was such a nice experience - from the ambiance, the service, the gracious accommodation of the oldest of the girls and her wheelchair.  Then there were the cocktails!I had a Waterlily and I could have floated down the stream very easily, had I not limited myself to one.  It was a lovely shade of violet.  I am going to take my sister back for a later birthday celebration - I hear the call of the waterlilies...The dogs and I went on a little jaunt to a local farm stand, noted for its sweet corn.  While I was slipping the dewy ears into my bag, I saw a pickup go by with a friend at the wheel - I waved frantically, but she vaguely looked at me and smiled -  one of those, \"hello, friendly stranger\" kinds of looks.  When I got home, I realized that she wouldn't have recognized me - dog rescue hat pulled down to my ears, sunglasses, mask, barn clothes.  She did email me later saying she had recognized Lovey, sticking out of the back window!  I guess these days we are recognizable by our dogs.Back to 'normal' this week, with an appointment with my doctor today to start the hip repair ball rolling.  As long as there is not another COVID flare up in NY or VT, I should be okay.  I have decided that my new normal will be whatever the day brings.  I hope your days bring you only good things.  xo"},

{"title": "Like molasses in January", "date": "Monday, July 6, 2020", "text": "Only, it's hot as hell in July.  However, there's been a hitch in my giddyap.  There's been no giddyap at all, frankly.  After much pressure from the Mothership, I took last week as vacation (now in a permanent state of staycation).  I am very frugal with my personal days (or PTO, in firmspeak), so I was rather smug with getting an entire week for only three and two-thirds days out of my PTO bank.  Ha!  The good news is that it rained almost every day of my vacation.  This means that I could take a break from daily watering of the garden and get to all the indoor things on my list.  I achieved one out of two and I bet you can guess which one.The garden is going gangbusters, thanks to my having more time to tend to it.  I spent Saturday and Sunday weeding, as those were the only two days with no rain forecast.  However, the temperatures have been climbing steadily, along with the humidity, and, as we all know by now, the higher those numbers, the lower my energy.  There was a lot of napping and as much showering as is prudent with my well.I finished a stack of muslin produce bags for my friend, Marianne's, new business venture - a general store that carries only local, regional and US-made goods, along with their organic vege, mushrooms and eggs.  While I am often the supplier of good ideas, that fact does not always go hand-in-hand with my being the producer of the outcome of those ideas.  I am not a seamstress, by any stretch of the imagination.  And my sewing machine(s) often let me down.  Such was the case.  I have a middle-aged Husqvarna machine that should have worked fine, as it was just serviced at the end of last year.  And these bags only require straight stitching.  Did I mention that I decided to go with French seams?  And that I had no real idea of what that was, other than a) French, therefore fancy, and b) the thing to use when you don't have a serger.  This required a LOT of thread and much bobbin-winding.  Which would have just been slightly annoying had it not been for the fact that I could no loosen that knob thingy on the big wheel thingy that powers the foot mechanism.  It would not loosen, no matter how hard I tried and what tools I plied to it.  I ended up pulling out my mother's elderly 1946 Singer Featherlight to finish the job.  That required much consultation on YouTube.  But the job was done and product delivered.  Heaven help me.Given the weather, not much knitting has gone onto or come off of the needles.  I did whip up a very cute bunny doll for Marianne's granddaughter - and since, as usual, it wasn't finished until a half hour before I was going to leave to deliver it, no photos were taken.  I am currently working on a bear version of the doll.  I am, apparently, in my \"Stuffie Phase\".  I will be sure to take a pic of this one.  Which I will take up again when the temperatures drop below 90 with 99 percent humidity.  Sometime in September.Other than that?  Not much.  I did manage to find homes for a carload of items I had winnowed out before the pandemic.  That was a bonus.  Thrift stores are slowly coming back to life, but with so many caveats that it's almost not worth the effort.  The Goodwill I frequent holds all donations for a period of 5 days before processing them - in large cardboard boxes...outside...  I have pared down my grocery shopping to once every three weeks.  Now that the garden is in second gear, I am able to provide all my salad greens, with zucchinis coming in soon.  Of the eight squash plants I planted - four zucchini and four yellow squash - all are zucchini with one lone yellow squash plant.  I really do have to work on my labeling for next year.  I have a pint jar of half sour pickles in the fridge and enjoyed a stir fry last night with one tiny zucchini, three kinds of kale, rat tail radish pods, and red onion.  Once my photos show up on Blogger (why, oh, why am I still only able to access May pics???) I will show you the fruits of my labors.I'm back in the saddle this week, with its usual parade of endless Zoom meetings, conference calls and other techie delights.  Speaking of Zoom, I will introduce you to my Zoom persona once I can access the photos I've been amassing.  My sisters, mom and nephew in NC did a Zoom meeting to celebrate Father's Day - the first one without dad.  My mother, bless her, peered over my sister's shoulder and cried, \"oh, look at all your little faces!\"  She's 96 and a pip.I hope you are all staying safe - not surprisingly, a lifting of lockdown has created the illusion that all is the same as it was before Covid.  It is not.  I know that I am much better suited (both by personality and lifestyle) to ride out extended isolation, but I also have no intention of spreading this killer to anyone in my family or elsewhere.  Let's hope consideration and empathy win out."},

Much. Fun.Lovey, feeling left out, threw up three times on the sofa cover.  Apparently, she ate her bully jerky too fast.  I am working my way through the wine cellar.(Sorry for the absence of photos - mine are not appearing in Blogger, for some reason.  I will try and work it out and put them in the next post.)"},

I may have to have a responsible adult accompany me into Aldi's from this point on.  I had four things on my list and walked out with two full bags.  Sigh.  They have all my numbers.  If I could only stay on the left side of the store...  I ended up with a large, fresh steelhead trout fillet and four packages of GF bagels (even though I am swearing off grains, dairy, sugar, legumes, and alcohol).  I am weak. I ended up poaching the trout in a broth/water/citrus concoction and made Mexican Restaurant Cauliflower Rice to go with it.  Oh, boy - both were excellent!  I am definitely going to try some other cauliflower rice mixtures!  Other than allowing myself two glasses of wine per weekend, I have been adhering to the Whole 30 guidelines and have noticed a bump-up in energy.On Sunday, I finally was able to clean the sheep's water bucket and rake out most of the discarded hay.  I also cinched up my BGPs and started on the back room.  It is not an endeavor for the faint of heart, let me tell you.  On a roll, I also blocked and finished a cardigan that I started last March, then finished the front trim, which needs a steam block, and will be blocking out a giant shawl/scarf that I just finished as well.  I have one sock done of a new pair and the second started.  Spring must be on the horizon!"},

There are three near me, but they are all 'full'.   I did finally find one a distance north of me and, as luck would have it, she has a doctor's appointment on Thursday that will put her within a reasonable distance ('reasonable' also being relative).  It also means I will be making six trips on Thursday, trying to watch mom and get the little fuzz ball some help.  And I am picking up and delivering some local aquafarm-raised lettuce to Marianne, so she can check it out for their store.  And I will be picking up some muslin to make produce bags for the aforementioned store.Friends always ask me how I will manage to keep from being bored when I retire."},

(insert the sound of crickets.)  I called Chewy to see if they knew what was going on.  They did not, but were friendly and made concerned sounds.  After four starts and stops, my first package was finally delivered.  I had run out of the dogs' food, but had been feeding them kibble with chopped Thanksgiving turkey leftovers, mixed with warm broth.  Poor dears...When the same ricochet pattern started happening on the second package, I had had enough.  There was the back and forth three times, with the final delivery scheduled for three days in the future!  There was no snow storm at this point.  I called Chewy's again and, after suggesting that they not renew their FedEx contract and letting them know that, while I thought they were the cat's jimjams, I was not happy with their shipments.  I mean, if it's delayed, then - by gum (not my exact words...) - say it's delayed.  I can deal with delay.  My life is a series of Plan Bs!  Ahem.They credited $15 on my order.  That took the puff out of my huff.Then it was time to contact FedEx customer service.  Which was almost impossible.  I could not get a human.  In desperation, I pounded \"0\" when trapped in the automated loop and was finally directed to customer service.  After a very long wait, I was finally connected to a person.  I then let them know what I thought about their on again/off again notifications and wanted an explanation for the three-day gap in final delivery (if it WOULD be the final delivery).  They started a file to investigate and told me that, if I hadn't heard back from anyone by Monday evening, I should call back on Tuesday.  This was Saturday and the final delivery was scheduled for Tuesday.  I pointed out to her that none of this was helpful and that I would be urging Chewy's to switch to UPS. My package arrived the next day.  On a Sunday.  It must have involved divine intervention.(squeak, squeak, squeak)"},

{"title": "The dangers of home canning.", "date": "Monday, November 18, 2019", "text": "Now that I have  your attention.  I will clarify that title.  The dangers of MY home canning.  Those of  you who have followed me for the last 9 years (!!!) know that I have a tendency to channel a 1930s prairie housewife with nine kids, when it comes to canning.  I have had one go at purging - pretty much chucking out (composting) anything older than 2012.  Yes, I still have canned tomatoes from 2012, but those things are like Styrofoam (not in taste and texture, hopefully), in that they last for years.A gratuitous pic of Slimmie on his lambskin.However, I still managed to delude myself that I could tell what the myriad of unlabeled jars contained.  That is why, on the weekend, when I was fixing my version of TexMex, I dumped a pint jar of mincemeat onto my rice and beans, instead of salsa.  I am an adventurous eater, but even I have my limits.  I scraped off as much as possible, separated the bits with rice clinging to them for the chickens who will eat almost everything, and then saved the rest of the mincemeat for breakfast.  On my granola.  It was a new taste sensation.  I will now be going through the unlabeled jars under bright lights before opening another.Luckily, a couple of other dishes fared better - spinach/chard quiche and polenta in my Instant Pot.  Years ago, when I had just moved to the area and was on the search for friends, I met my Other Els.  She was a weaver of exceptional talent (I have one of her linen transparencies with a sheep in my kitchen window), a lovely woman and friend - and a great cook and gardener.  She gave me a little piece of lovage, which I have managed not to kill, and that now towers above everything in the herb garden.  She also was an excellent quiche-maker.  The family was vegetarian, so she was a wizard with vege.  I had forgotten - until this weekend - that she would spread a layer of Dijon mustard on the bottom of the crust, then put a layer of cheese, then the vege, then the custard.  In one bite, you got a crispy crust (cheese), tang (mustard), chew (vege), and creaminess (custard).  That's just what I did with mine and it is good!  Which is lucky, as I will be eating it all week.Half the box of the infamous shiitakesI came across a video on Youtube that showed how to make polenta in an instant pot - what ho!  Just what I needed - hot, creamy comfort food.  I was also dying to try my polenta grits from the Mill at Janie's Farm.  It took me about 25 minutes to produce a vat of creamy polenta with just the slightest bit of chewiness (my preferred texture).  The bonus was that the leftovers will/have become fried mush (a specialty of my dad's when we were growing up).  That is basically sliced, cold polenta, fried in a generously buttered pan until crispy on both sides, then served with maple syrup.From the barnyard - there was an unexplained dust-up between the Blondie sisters, resulting in the bloodied head of one of the girls.  I have no idea what started it, but I saw blood on the outside of one of the nesting boxes after I had let them out - leaving me searching vainly for the wounded party.  I finally spotted her bloody head and that night, under the light of my trusty headlamp, I cleaned her up as best as I could and dabbed on some antibiotic.  She seemed just fine this morning and there hasn't been more violence.  It's always something.It was a weekend of bits and bobs - I managed to repair the bird feeder for my railing; I got a pedicure and now sport magenta toes; I changed the filters on my Berkey; I toted trash and recycling to the transfer station; I delivered eggs to my neighbors; I found a home for the cross-country skis; I loaded two 50# bags of chicken feed into their bin (why is it that a 50# bag now feels as if it weighs twice that much?)  I restacked some hay, did a little rearranging in the living room, and managed a meager attempt at housecleaning.  I also spent a lot of time listening to an audio book that I cannot leave to just car time - so far, I have listened to three in the series by Anne Cleeves upon which the series Shetland is based.  Besides terrific writing, character development and plot lines that hold you in their grip right up to the end, it's read by a Scotsman.  Lawsymercy, I am such a sucker for the birrs and twirls of a deep Scotch voice.  If someone told me he was wearing a kilt while reading the script, I don't think I could deal with it.These nuts were in one of the empty eggcartons given to me by my neighbors.There is a very unhappy squirrel somewhere."},

I have done my food shopping for November, moved tools into the barn for the winter, given Slimmie's room and good cleaning and reorganizing (of which he was none too pleased - cats are such creatures of habit), the winter curtains are up, summer curtains washed and stowed away.  I got a load of firewood in and my sister (bless her heart) came down to help me with the pre-winter coop cleaning.  I am always so amazed at how fast a job goes with more than one - and how much more fun it is.  I made another pot of soup, so now I have at least two weeks' worth of lunches in the freezer.I also got a text from Marianne saying that they had a lot of shiitake mushrooms and did I want some?  Into the car I hopped and came back with 'some' in a box (I would have inserted a photograph here, but Blogger had other ideas).  Envision a box that held a dozen pint canning jars.  Now envision a mound of shiitake mushrooms the size of cup saucers - about 5 pounds of them!  I got out the dehydrator and got busy.  I now have about 2 gallons of dried shiitake mushrooms that should last a while.  A decade or so.I find it ironic that, when I finally remember to pull myself together and take pics for you, Blogger decides it is not allowing the insertion - nay, even the ability to connect with them - of any images.  I will add them randomly to a later post.Yesterday, taking advantage of the extra hour of daylight, I firmly yanked my BGPs up to my armpits (you're welcome for that visual) and tackled the carport.  I hauled out all the remaining flotsam of the ill-fated yard sale, sorted my garden supplies, moved all the garden implements to the barn, hefted, sorted, cussed and finally got it to the point where I can get 95% of my car inside.  I have to spread some straw and align my wheelbarrows and I will be all set.  I took photos of all the yard sale remnants and put them on Facebook for free.  Six of them will be marched out the door tonight.  Progress!  I'm giving the rest a week, then off to Goodwill they go.  Virtuosity is my middle name."},

You can see Connie and I hard at it in the bottom picture.I had a bag of second apples that Marianne had given me, so I tried out a new gluten free apple crisp.  I really loved the apple part, but the crisp part was too thick for me.  A new take on flavoring the apples was to add two tablespoons of bourbon and two tablespoons of water, with cinnamon, lemon juice and a little cornstarch.  The crisp topping called for oatmeal, a little melted butter, chopped pecans, almond flour, and Greek yogurt.  It wasn't bad at all, but definitely was better eaten warm.  I'll be experimenting over the fall and winter - since I will be the recipient of many organic apple 'seconds'.  I sure don't mind a spot or two, or three - especially for cooking apples!This week I launch into Soup Season - with a new recipe for pumpkin and black bean soup.  It also has a diced sweet potato and a little minced jalapeno, so it sounds divine.  I will report back!Because of recent events, I am very behind on my winter prep, so I am taking Thursday and Friday off.  Of course, it will rain all day tomorrow and Friday is forecast for 45 mph wind gusts.  That will put the coop cleaning off until Saturday, when it's dry and not windy - just very cold.  Has to be done, so I am going to dig out my mittens!  Good thing I have lots to do, both inside and out, so that no minute is wasted.  Woohoo!"},
{"title": "Saying goodbye.", "date": "Monday, October 28, 2019", "text": "Dad.  1922-2019I am very lucky to have had my father around for so long.  He was sharp as a tack until he hit 90, and then dementia crept in and robbed him of his memory and, finally, his dignity.  It is a shitty condition, if you'll pardon my French.  As a family, we are totally blessed with a sister who's super power is sublime compassion, patience, humor and strength.  She has, basically, put her life aside for the past five years to be a full-time caregiver.  And now, there is mom.  Thankfully, she does NOT have dementia.  But she is 96 and all signs point to more years ahead.As we sat waiting for the funeral folks to arrive to spirit dad away (pun intended), we all agreed that we had made it through the past five years thanks to good wine (that would be the three sisters), close family ties and dark humor.  And humor was needed in the last couple of weeks.  In the middle of dad's fairly rapid decline at the end, the septic system backed up and ceased functioning.  There was my sister, with two old ladies (mom - 96 and her sister - 94), and our dying father.  Here is where level-headedness, preparedness and humor come to bear.Anyone who has dealt with the very elderly knows that the topic of conversation from rising in the morning to toddling off to bed in some way involves 'elimination' (my mother's choice of terms).  The magic of prune juice; the mystery of Metamucil; the benefits of dried apricots; how much water you drink; the need for the morning cup of coffee to 'get things working'.  As my sister pointed out, there was a dire lack of 'movement' with the ladies until the septic system quit working.  Enter the potty chair (senior edition).  All of a sudden, there was lots of 'movement'.  As they shuffled back and forth down the hall on matching walkers, each would whisper to my sister, \"I've left you a little package, heehee.\"  My sister, figuring she had enough potty bags to last a week, ran out in two days.  Snort.There were many frantic calls placed to their septic service who, I might add, showed a complete lack of compassion and appalling customer service.  I tried my guys (they of the dimpled, blue-eyed blond fellow), who would have loved to have helped, but could not cross state lines.  They did give me a name - Uncle Bob's Septic Service - in Bennington and thank goodness they did.  Uncle Bob's dropped what they were doing and headed over.  The pumper wasn't working, but they spent two hours trying to find the tank, then managed to clear the pipe so that it worked.  My sister went out to thank them and found that the supervisor had recently lost his mother to cancer and the two of them stood next to the open septic tank, sobbing.  They also donated a snazzy new lid so that the tank would be easier to find in the future.  Uncle Bob's now has customers for life.Connie sent a text to us early last Saturday saying that she thought dad would probably not last the day.  I flung food at the dogs, sent an email to my neighbor, asking him to let the chickens out when it was light enough, and I headed to VT.  It was a long day and dad finally left us in the afternoon.  It was sad and it was a relief.So, that is where I have been.  We are now tying up loose ends and focusing our love and affection on mom.  She's quite jazzed about it."},

{"title": "1001 Zucchini Recipes", "date": "Monday, August 19, 2019", "text": "I am on a roll.  So far, there's been zucchini bread with lemon glaze (soon to be repeated), zucchini pizza crust (more than once), zucchini quesadillas, zucchini pancakes (the best I've ever had), Mediterranean Zoodles, zoodles with olive oil, garlic and salt and pepper, and zucchini and black bean burgers, scrambled eggs with sauteed zucchini.  Els, if you're listening, I hope you like zucchini...Zucchini crust pizza - my fav!There's room for more.As of this morning.I'm glad there is so much zucchini, because (a) I love it; (b) it is versatile; (c) everything else in the garden has been disappointing.  I've been making notes as to changes that need to happen in the garden next year.  It's apparent that the new 'normal' for gardening is that anything can happen and usually does - multiple times.  It's either a cold, super-wet spring, then extended heat waves with no rain, then end-to-end thunderstorms with high winds, downpours and hail.  We're just missing the snakes and locusts, but I don't really want to encourage that kind of pestilence.Speaking of pestilence, I have had a real battle with wasps this year.  I locate and destroy their nests, only to find that they've returned and built a bigger - and better - nest in the same location.  I found a huge nest in the barn which I was going to destroy - but then thought I should check the run-in shed first.  Once I spray the honkin' big nest in the barn, I will have to block access to the barn and wanted to be sure Apria and the Boys had alternative shelter.  Good thing I checked, because - drum roll - honkin' big nest in the run-in shed.  I did my best Terminator rendition on that nest and will take it down tonight.  Then, in the morning, I will start on the barn colony.  Let's hope that's it for the year.Back in the garden, my yard-long green beans have been a fair producer.  The red noodle beans have just started flowering.  I have two tiny melons on one of the three puny vines.  My peppers are pooped, apparently.  The plants did not flourish, but there were lots of peppers.  The poblanos (seen to the left in the photo above) are coming along, although there are few of them.  I have had one eggplant (ditto above) and am in a locked battle with potato bugs on my four plants.  The kale and chard are doing well.  The garlic and onions were pathetic.  The cucumbers are struggling.  And the tomatoes.  All sixteen plants.  I have lots and lots of green tomatoes, but have, so far, only had two ripen.  I've managed to eke by with my blueberry tomatoes - a cherry tomato in a lovely blue-black color, but they are not as prolific as I had hoped.  I have myself to blame for the tomatoes - they take a lot of tending and half of July and half of August, they did not get enough attention.  But, we gardeners are a tough bunch with cast iron BGPs (and BBPs - let's be fair).  We will come back strong next year."},

along with kale and chard with scrambled eggs for dinner.  My neighbor gifted us with green beans, bless his heart, but I'm glad to see that one of the varieties that I planted is finally coming to bear.  I decided to go exotic this year - red noodle and yardlong beans on a trellis.  I also picked Black Hungarian peppers, not pictured, which are the size and shape of jalapenos, but - not surprisingly - black.  They are milder than a jalapeno, and I love them.  The poblanos are coming along, but the eggplant are dragging their roots.  I hope this is not another eggplant-less season.  My garlic crop was the worst in my gardening history, thanks to endless rain and cold temperatures throughout the spring.  Ah, well, next year.OMGThis little beauty arrived in yesterday's post (thank you again, J) and considerably brightened my day, week and life!  It is now my centerpiece because I need to see it every day.  You will probably not be able to notice, but I now have a new-to-me dining room table.  I will take a full photo of it for a later post.  Rosie came bearing (many) gifts, including this table - made from two repurposed Mexican pine doors.  I love it, but it caused me to scramble to find a home for my existing table.  It is now housed with a couple who were thrilled to get it.  I get a lot of satisfaction from the process.  My little maple table was given to me by a local woman who came to get a lockset I put on Freecycle when I first moved in.  When she came to pick it up, she noticed that I was a little light in the furniture department.  I had moved in with a rocking chair, a bed, a small bedside table, a lamp and a patio table and chairs that I was using in the dining room.  She invited me to 'go shopping' in her barn, where they had stored furniture from her late mother's and MIL's estates.  Bless her heart.  I have enjoyed that table for 13 years.I am so glad I had that highly successful yard sale (can you hear the drip, drip, drip of sarcasm?) since I now have had an influx of objects from Rosie and from a neighbor/friend who sold her (chock-a-block full) house and 'gifted' me with numerous treasures.  I am going to have to start all over again.We had an unfortunate chicken incident late last week.  Rosie had spotted what we believe to be a small mink, racing from the corner of the house to the chicken coop.  It was small enough not to bother the chickens, but was probably poaching eggs (pun intended).  She came home from getting her windshield replaced and, as she let the dogs into the fenced off area next to the chicken yard, the mink shot across the Pat's view and he was off like a torpedo, hitting the gate low (admittedly, the gate closure was shaky), and pushing through.  He missed the mink, but discovered the chickens, as well as the other two dogs, who were close behind.  Rosie was right behind them, but all three had chickens in their jaws by the time she bellowed for them to DROP IT!!!  Fae and Lovey obeyed instantly.  Guess who did not.  Maybe I should rename him Beethoven.  There were a lot of feathers, a few limping hens and one who did not make it.  Needless to say, the gate is now bungeed to within an inch of its life.  Rosie yelled so loudly that her voice was an octave lower for days.Rosie and Fae are up North for a few days - giving us all a break.  Slimmie has been glued to my side, while Lovey spends most of her time standing outside of Rosie's door, waiting for her to appear.  Things on the family front are sticky.  My dad, who suffers from dementia, continues to worsen.  My mother is dealing with depression.  My middle sister is dealing with them both, as we try to find a solution that will help everyone.  I know a lot of you are dealing with, or have dealt with the same.  We are living too long.A snapshot of a happier family gathering:I am on the left.  I think I look like a youngTemple Grandin.  This was taken at our family camp in northern Ontario.  I'm not sure what we're looking at, but it might have been the Little Redstone Lake Monster."},

There’s nothing worse, to me, than sitting around looking at your list multiplying and not having the energy to tackle it. However I did get a little boost from an  unusual source on Sunday. When I dropped off the baked goods at the farm, I found out that one of my gravel pit neighbors ( codename: Pinocchio) was in the process of trying to get a permit to screen over 50,000 yards of soil. Apparently, that comes out to around 2800 truckloads. Or 2800 trucks going past my house, twice. Plus the noise of the screening. I was so incensed I think there was smoke coming out of my ears.There is nothing like righteous indignation to give one an energy boost! I got on the Internet and found the email address for the mining division of the DEC.  I then fired off an email to them and sent emails to everyone I know who has any connection with state government. I’ll  do everything in my power to make sure that that permit is not issued. Our road is in terrible shape now, with just the heavy truck traffic that we have with the two mines.  Quadrupling – or whatever-ing - the traffic is not going to make it better. There is also a small bridge that is crumbling and it would be disastrous to subject it to that kind of wear.  Hmm.   Then, again, should the bridge collapse with a truck carrying a full load, I guess that would put a monkey wrench in the traffic pattern.   I digress.I was pleased that DEC responded quickly,  and I now have names, email addresses and phone numbers, plus some leads to influential people.    I’ve only just begun the fight.*****The Little Prince (aka The Butter Pat, The Pat, Mr. Stinky) had to go to the vet this morning for his first seasonal allergy shot.  And nail clipping.  This now involves:  administering half a sedative an hour before his appointment; strapping him into his brace; clipping him into his booster seat, all while Lovey looks on, worried.  He is the only dog I have had (beside Scrappy, who was 99.999% perfect) who just can't wait to get to the vet's.  He almost levitates up the ramp.  This morning, we came through the door and smack into a vastly overweight and amped up lab mix.  Who roared.  This set off the high yodeling of the Pat.  It was chaos.  His vet, Dr. Hannah, came running across the waiting room and scooped him up and trotted back to an examining room, me in tow.  There was much cooing and massaging of little ham legs and carrying-on.  No wonder he looks forward to it.  I would, too.  No one offered to massage my big ham legs, however.  And thank goodness.While they were waiting until the reception area was clear - the 'fluffy' lab is the polar opposite of the Pat, shedding in fear like a ninja and peeing all over the place - Little Prince managed to draw a crowd - there were two vets, two vet techs and a receptionist, all squeezed into the lab, taking turns rubbing his little cranium and hand-feeding him treats, all talking in high-pitched voices.  It was embarrassing.  By the time we made it back to the car, his little head was drooping and he dozed all the way home.  There was a joyful reunion of siblings - parted for those long minutes - and then he went into his crate on his own, pulled up his blanket and was asleep before I left for work.  I want to come back as the Pat.*****I know it's going to be worse before it's better, but this organizing for a yard sale is horrendous!  I have piles everywhere.  There is no surface showing.  I am starting to develop a tic.  It hasn't helped that it's been put off for a week - the weather last weekend was uncooperative.  This Sunday is so-so, but I am not putting it off again.  I had planned on putting an ad in the local rag and went through the grinding process of actually contacting someone.  If you call, you get voicemail.  There is no information in the paper as to the cost of ads ($ per line), so one is forced to send an email.  A full week later, I received a reply.  Eight emails later - with me sending them my copy and requesting a price and never getting one - I got this reply:  \"One problem.  Every summer we take the first week of July off and there is no paper.\"  Seven emails prior to this, I gave him the copy - which included the date of the sale (7/7) and told him I needed it to run in this week's edition.  I do believe he expected me to change the date of my sale to coincide with his vacation.  I will turn to Facebook.  It's no wonder that social media is taking over the world.  And that is not a good thing, IMHO.  Friday I will get my change and start setting up.  Saturday I will finish setting up and take pictures of the 'highlighted' items to post on FB.  Sunday morning, mimosa in hand (kidding.  maybe.)

{"title": "An Historical Weekend.", "date": "Monday, June 3, 2019", "text": "This will go down in my personal history as the first time I was ever run over by a sheep.  And not just any sheep.  A sheep the size of a Shetland pony.  Norman, you know who you are.Evidence.Friday dawned as a lovely spring day.  I was fairly organized for a change, and had my shearing paraphernalia all in order and by the back door.  All I had to do was wait for the call.  Since my shearer was going in reverse order this year, I figured I would be early afternoon in the line-up.  That left time for some serious puttering in the garden, and for the sheep to graze before being lured into the shearing area and closed in.  All went smoothly.  It should have been a sign but, alas, I was blissfully ignorant.I had decided to sit out my usual assistant role at my neighbor's but, after some thought, I decided that it would be more prudent to help - otherwise, I wouldn't have my boys done until dusk.  My neighbor is totally unfocused, unorganized and a general hot mess.  So I chuffed up and volunteered, then headed down the road.  It was as I expected.  After a chaotic forty-five minutes of wrestling, shooing, dodging, cleaning, and more wrestling, we had his five sheep, one angora goat and two less-than-helpful alpacas shorn.  Back to the Little Lucky, all seemed quiet.  (Cue eerie music)  Joe and I headed for the barn.  Joe had gone through the gate and set up, then wrestled the fat eel (Linden) into submission, when Norman appeared at the barn door - hysterical - and shot toward the gate.  And me.  It was one of those moments you remember in slow motion - NOOOOOOOOOOOoooooo - as he broadsided me, gate and all and literally ran over me.   I was flattened, vaguely protected from his pointy hooves by the gate, with thoughts of mutton dancing through my head.  Joe was horrified, but, as we do, I pulled up my muddy BGPs, fixed the gate and prepared a bowl of grain.  If anything can be said for Norman (anything that can be said in polite company, that is), his stomach overrides his pea-sized brain every time.  By the time he trotted his fat carcass through the gate and over to the grain bowl, Joe was done with the eel.  So I had the satisfaction of having Norman wrenched from his treat and plopped on his sizeable derriere.I managed to limp through the rest of the day and was totally knackered by 8P - so off to bed.  Interestingly, last weekend I was also totally knackered and was completely (well, 90%) reenergized by morning.  This Saturday, I awoke feeling as if I had not slept at all, and dragged through the entire day.  As it turned out, it was good timing, as I was on the road from 8A until arriving home at 3P, then out the door again at 4P, arriving home for good at 6:30P.  By Sunday morning, I was back to my old self.  Which, unfortunately, included a very sore hip and knee.  This lifestyle is not for sissies.I managed to try some new recipes this weekend which were ... interesting.  I made some almond flour blueberry muffins - gluten free and low sugar - which turned out to be rather soggy.  I don't know that I have ever had soggy muffins before this.  I think it was because the recipe called for a quarter cup of melted coconut oil - which seemed to be too much.  The flavor is very good but they are odd.  I had my neighbor over for dinner - my way of reciprocating for all of his help around the farm - and tried a slightly altered version of a foil packet dinner from The Kitchn.  I don't know why I thought it would be roasted - sealed in a tight packet, it was more like poached - but it was okay; not great.  I also tried another pickled quail egg recipe (the bourbon recipe was great!) and will make some tiny Scotch eggs this week in my efforts to use up things in my freezer.I can hardly wait to see what next weekend has in store for me.  I hope I live through it."},

{"title": "Where have you been all my life, Everything Parmesan Crisps?", "date": "Monday, May 13, 2019", "text": "I'd have inserted a photograph here, but I ate them.  All of them.  Without pause.  Well, with some pauses, but short ones.  And there is no use to photograph he weather.  Think rain forest.I am not going to go on about the weather, because I hate it and it makes me hyperventilate.  We had about 5 hours without rain and about 3 hours of sun over the weekend.  (STOP IT, depressing weather-speak!)Anyhoo, I had made an appointment for a spa pedicure - strictly on the basis of testing out the facility, you understand.  We (my younger sister and I) are plotting my middle sister's birthday surprise and, being in the veritable middle of nowhere, it's not easy to come up with luxurious day spas that don't cost an arm and a leg and include half a day's travel.  I was quite pleasantly surprised (I apologize, nice spa lady, if I snored....or drooled...) and so we are set.  All that is left is to further plot how we are going to get her there.  I have volunteered to lie like a rug and then kidnap her and deliver her - blindfolded, if needed - to her mini-spa treatment.  I am nothing if not sneaky.By the time I got home, I had about one hour to do outside work before the rain returned.  I had invited a 'friend' for a glass of wine and finger foods, so was tear-assing around, cleaning and straightening, when I got a text saying she really didn't have time.  (Ergo, the quotation marks around friend.)  So, there I sat with a relatively tidied house, a chilled bottle of rose and a plate full of Everything Parmesan Crisps, a new recipe.  So I tried one.  Made animal sounds and ate the rest.  The recipe is from Skinny Taste (thank you, Sylvie, for introducing me to them!) and is incredibly easy:Grate 1/2 cup parmesan cheese on the large holes of a box grater.  Line a baking tray with a silicone mat (preferable) or parchment paper.  Divide the cheese into four separate little piles on the lined pan, spread each pile out to about a 4\" circle, leaving room between.  Put in a preheated 400 degree oven for 3 minutes.  Remove from oven, sprinkle each with  3/4 tsp of a combination of sesame seeds, dried onion flakes, dried garlic flakes and poppy seeds (I use Trader Joe's Everything but the Bagel mix), then put them back in the oven for 3-5 minutes, until they are golden.  Take out and let them cool.  You're welcome.I slogged out to the yard and clipped a shopping bag of nettle tops, slogged back in and blanched them, freezing some and making my favorite spring soup out of the rest.  I have to say that I like nettles more than spinach in some recipes, this being one - it's basic:Half a shopping bag of nettle tops, blanched for 3 minutes, put in an ice bath, then thick stems removed and nettles roughly choppedHeat a nugget of butter and a slur-up of olive oil in a soup pan (I use the same pan as I did to blanch the nettles - dishes, you know) and saute until translucent a small onion, chopped, and a stalk or two of celery, chopped.  Add to this some diced potatoes and about 2-3 cups of chicken broth (or vege broth), a bay leaf and a teaspoon of dried thyme.  Bring to a boil and then simmer for about 10 minutes.  Add the nettles and more broth or water if needed.  Simmer 10 minutes more, until potatoes are tender.  Remove the bay leaf and use an immersion blender or pour (carefully) into a blender and blend until smooth.  You can add a dollop of heavy cream or half and half if you wish, but I like mine straight up.  It helps you through the cold, wet weather.Other than that - Mother's Day was a dark, cold, rainy blur - I did more cleaning and then canoed up to Vermont and back.  I have potted up the last of my seedlings and planted the Bibb lettuce and arugula in the cold frame.  It was too wet to put up the electronet for the sheep yet, but I did get the energizer set up.  I sit in the early mornings, knitting away, and listen to the birds wake up amidst the pitter-pat of the incessant rain.  I know that this weather will pass - eventually.  As is now commonplace, the rain will stop, it will become summer overnight and I will be moaning and groaning about the lack of rain.  There is no pleasing me.  I should take my cue from the resident Carolina Wren - he is filled with music, no matter what the weather.  Just happy to be alive."},

(Will Robinson!  for those of you ancient enough to recognize the line.)When I got to the front door and unlocked it, I could not get it open.  There was much frenzied yapping in the living room and, having not forgotten the horrors of old, I dropped my bag, vaulted down the front steps, tore around the house to the back, took the backs steps five at a time (there are four) and ripped open the sliding glass door.At which point, the barking ceased and everyone was so happy to see me.Peanut, his first day out of stir, had toppled a 40# box containing my quail food, had wrestled with it (pushing it against the front door) gnawed on it, clawed it, and had managed to chew off an end corner (HEAVY cardboard box), chewed through the packing paper and chewed off a corner of the feed bag.  He was moving pretty slowly by the time I got to him.Seriously?Judging by the 'end' result, both he and Lovey had managed to inhale some of the high protein organic feed.  There were small portions for dinner that night and The Pat is back in stir while I am not there.It boggles the mind."},

while not repulsive - odd.  This does not stop me.  I did draw the line at adding raisins to my 'salad', as the combo of tomato + raisin does give me pause.Let's see.  What's new.  It's not raining yet!  This is the first day in over 10 days that I have not had to slog through the rain to do morning chores and try to reach my car without my 'style' dissolving.  Of course, it had to occur NOT on a weekend day, but a day where I can only enjoy it virtually - out my office window with a view of other office windows.  Not to worry, it will rain later today.  There is a slim chance that it may not rain at all tomorrow, but I'm not holding my breath.  At least this constant dismality has made it easier to harden off my seedlings.What it has not done, however, is given me a chance to replace my raised beds.  I managed to get the cross pieces cut under the cover of my carport and I did transplant a peony, but that has been the extent of my outdoor activity.  That and scraping the square meter of muck that sticks to the bottom of my shoes every time I go out to do chores.Enough about the weather.  Safe to say, it stinks.I am soldiering along on another pair of short socks and I managed to push my way (virtually) into a charity crochet-along with the home office.  Truth be told, it was listed as Knit a Square and, as always, I read no further.  Apparently, the home office is full of crocheters, not knitters.  Not to be dissuaded, learning to crochet has been on my bucket list (you will note that I have low expectations of the lead-up to my demise) so I volunteered.  I am relieved that I am going to be at the end of a phone line, as my crochet speed is still in first gear.  I watched a quick YouTube tutorial for Slow Instructions for the Very Beginner, taught by a 14 year old, and found, much to my delight, that it is fun!  Tomorrow I labor along, trying to achieve two squares to their fifteen.  No matter, it's given me the impetus that I needed to take it further.I had every intention of celebrating Cinco de Mayo with bells on, but I was having a friend to dinner who has an extremely limited palate.  I did manage to squeeze in a modified huevos rancheros for breakfast.Close enough.Dinner, although well-planned on paper, skirted disaster.  I had decided to make dinner with the slow cooker function of my Instant Pot.  Easypeasy.  (Insert pregnant pause)  As we all know by now - everyone but me, apparently - nothing goes as planned.  All I had to do on Sunday was to take my recycling to the transfer station, feed the farm cat(s), drop off eggs at my neighbors and come back to put three ingredients and a simple sauce in the slow cooker.  What could go wrong?  How about everything?  It poured and delayed the loading of my car.  Dropping off the eggs involved a longer than expected visit with my elderly neighbors.  By the time I finally reached the transfer station, there was a double line of cars and trucks and I was in Transfer Station Pergatory for almost a half hour.  When I finally got back home, my neighbor had already arrived to help me prepare the lumber for the raised beds.  The dogs needed to go out, but didn't want to because - rain.  When I finally got inside to throw dinner in the Instant Pot, I had just enough time - according to the recipe - to get the thing cooked in time for the arrival of my dinner guest.  I still had to vacuum and sweep and do the usual housecleaning things, get chores done and spiffy up.  About 40 minutes before she arrived, I realized that I did not smell anything - there should have been some sort of mouth-watering aroma emanating from my Instant Pot by then.  I took the lid off and discovered that the roast was about 1/2 of the way cooked.   Not phased, for once, I pressure-cooked it for 35 minutes and it was perfect.  Bless you, Instant Pot.I also found a new home for my potato grow bags - I've decided to plant my potatoes in tires, when I do plant potatoes.  Between Marianne and my neighbor, I get plenty of potatoes in the late summer/early fall, so I don't have to plant them and that frees up precious space in my garden.  I am hoping that the rain gods move their focus somewhere else and soon, so that I can get cracking on the one million items on my List and that's only in the garden!"},

their products have never let me down and anytime I have had a question or needed to contact someone, they have been forthcoming and helpful.  Given this day and age, that's saying something.So.....half of my birthday/xmas money went to the fencing, while the other half went here:I love it!I have been wrestling with a workable solution to feeding hay to the El-Destructos (aka the sheep).  I had two welded steel hay feeders in the barn for winter.  I now have half of one.  The other has been entirely taken apart.  I  have no words.I stumbled across the design - well, actually, just a picture of it - for this feeder on the internet.  I had Billy (Love of the Pat's life, although he is entirely fickle, as you will see below) whip it up, along with a salad table, that I am planning on installing in my soon-to-be hoophouse/greenhouse.  The only thing left to be done is to put hinges and a handle on the top, so that I can lift it and drop the hay into the feeding area.  It will reduce hay waste a great deal, hold the seeds - which the sheep love - in the bottom and generally make my life easier.  There are holes drilled in the bottom to make sure water drains out.Extreme roots﻿﻿﻿Little newbies between the full-grownhybrids.  Which are in need of a good haircut.(You'll have to biggify and squint hard to see them)Since it took an hour to dig three holes for my willow starts (there is a reason there are two gravel pits on my road), I decided to put the remaining three up for grabs on my local Facebook marketplace.  Is it just me, or am I expected to divine the meaning of \"interested\"?  Is it to mean \"I am interested and would like them\", \"I am only interested in being the first person to be interested\", or \"none of the above\"?  I have had four people send me a message either saying they are 'interested' or asking if they are still available.  Then....crickets.Speaking of crickets - I think I have four female quail and one male.  The females sound just like the spring peepers I can hear off in the distant wetlands.  The one male - that I was sure was a female because I am an expert on quail - does this rather abrupt and alarming trilling crow that always makes me jump.  Egg production has started, albeit a bit unevenly.  But, still.  I am working out a name for this very valuable, rare and special product and came up with this:Let me know what you think.  I have decided on pulp (paper-based) cartons, as I loathe plastic and am trying my best not to have any more in my life.  Once the design is finished, I will turn it into a stencil and put it on the top of the cartons.  The quail pic needs to be 'deconstructed' into a much simpler design that would lend itself to stenciling.  That is one of my tasks over the weekend.  I'm hoping to start boxing them next week.I whipped up a Cranberry Cake for the barn guys this Sunday and got a very enthusiastic reception.  As a matter of fact, it was declared the best yet - then the milk truck driver entered the milk room and there was one lone piece left.  He eyed it.  The farmer eyed it.  Then the farmer sighed and offered it to the driver.  I think I saw tears in his eyes (kidding).  The recipe for the cake is here.  I do not put the topping on it because that would be gilding the lily.  I also bake it in a bundt style springform pan because this baby is dense!  I saved the other half for my neighbor.  Because he came over last week and raked up my entire yard.  At 84, he is a marvel.Now that I've segued to recipes...I could not find my original recipe for the fermented carrot ginger slaw, but here is basically the same thing.  As it ferments, the carrots get very tender.  It's great - the taste is bright and slightly sour with a little zing from the ginger.The damper on the fireplace has been fixed - with, as always, the Pat's invaluable help.  Honestly.  The chimney guy came with his crew, one of whom the Pat became particularly enamored with.  The poor guy was down on his side, with his head in my fireplace when the Pat broke out of his crate and made a mad dash for him - bringing along six toys.  He forced himself into his arms and kissed him wildly.  It was embarrassing.  However, the fellow was just as enamored with the Pat and I thought I would have to forcibly separate them.  The other fellow looked at Lovey and said, \"Is that a Pit?\" with an obvious sneer.  I said (trying mightily to hold the fury and distain out of my voice), that she was, indeed, a Pit mix -

There are two male cardinals duking it out, vocally, in two opposing trees.  A definite sign of spring, as is the much-welcomed red wing blackbird. I’ve brought the birdfeeders in and will only scatter seeds randomly during the day. I am sure bear activity will be up with the warming weather.    The tally on birdseed for this winter was approximately 150 pounds.   I have about 20 pounds left and when that’s gone, it’s over. If the weather is not too awful tomorrow, I will commence the dreaded process of looking for a new car.

- it was also in the exact color that I was thinking about.  Lawsymercy.  (You know who you are, you Yarn Fairy, you.)The SweaterThe yarnAs with all things I jump into, this pattern was unknown territory - knit from the bottom up (first for me), with a shaped form (read: decreasing in pattern - argh).  I sallied forth.  And promptly had to rip it completely back.  Too much sallying, too little focus.  This morning I shunned all social media, made a large cup of strong coffee, and concentrated.  Hi-ho!If you don't believe that this endless frigid weather can cause one to lose the farm, become that last straw, make grown men weep and babies cry, well then, I am here to tell you that it can make quail go completely postal.   For most of this week, the overnight temperatures have hovered near, or under, zero.  The daytime temperatures haven't been anything to write home about either.  My quail have braved this weather for months - but, apparently, last night was the last straw.  When I uncloaked the hutch this morning, I noticed some bright red dots on the upstairs level.  OMG!  I got the door opened and the largest quail (most likely female) was chasing down her roommates and pecking them bloody!  I removed her and marched her down to the wood line and bid her bon voyage.  The remaining quail were huddled, bloody-headed and unnerved in a far corner.  I hope they can recover, poor things.  I have a feeling the Quail Venture is doomed.  (Really?  And, pray tell, why would you think that????)  Had it not been for my required hour commute this morning, there would have been bourbon in my hot chocolate.I am going to put my seed-starting set up together this weekend in my hour of unscheduled time.  To hell with the housework.  I need something that evokes sunshine and green things."},

Theresa!  of Camp Runamuck.Book 2 - Retired Knitter!Theresa, I have your particulars, so to speak, so I will post the book this week.  Retired Knitter, please contact me via email and give me your mailing address.Yay, winners!Last week ended with a bang, figuratively speaking.  We had torrential rain all day Thursday, which fell on frozen ground and caused lots of flooding.  The ground was frozen because it was -12 on Monday.  I wonder how many gods we have pissed off...  A cold front blew through late Thursday afternoon, changing the rain into snow, so my commute home took three tries and lasted two hours.  During the last part of the ordeal, I had to take an alternate route down my mountain through 6 inches of snow on the road, frozen flooding, white out conditions and in the pitch dark.  Life out here is not for the faint-hearted.  I was sorely tempted to kiss the frozen ground in front of my house when I finally got home, but there were two dogs with their legs crossed in the house.Friday morning, as I was busying myself to get ready for work, a neighbor sent a text telling me to check the news (I don't have television service) because some large boats had broken loose on the upper Hudson River and were zigzagging their way south.  Most of the bridges had been closed.  This means that it is virtually impossible to get from the east into the city.  I worked from home.Saturday, my volunteer meeting was rescheduled, so I ended up having the whole day - woohoo!  I went to the farm and fed the cats, picked up milk and had a conversation with my farmer.  He is planning on selling his dairy herd in the spring, keeping his heifers and doing nothing but hay.  Another small dairy farmer bites the dust.  It is an alarming trend in my area and in many areas in the Northeast -and across the country.  The price of milk is pitifully low, the cost of feed, insurance, equipment, etc. just keeps going up, and the small farmer ends up barely making ends meet.  There is also an alarming number of suicides among the small farming community because of this.  It breaks my heart.  Jasmine will be retired in the spring and off to (literally) greener pastures, at Marianne's beautiful farm.  And I will have to find another source of raw milk.I made yogurt and threw together a really good soup.  It had chickpeas, butternut squash, apples, green chilis, vege broth, coconut milk, some chopped red peppers from the freezer, a jar of my home-canned diced tomatoes, garlic, curry powder, and cinnamon.  It was delicious and warming.  I also tackled the end of my apples from Marianne, peeling, coring, slicing and dehydrating them.  They were a little lackluster in the flavor department, so I sprinkled a little cinnamon on them before dehydrating.  The house smelled wonderful!  This also provided a mound of peels and cores for the sheep and llama.Sunday I finished my sister's socks (yay!) and realized I had knit my fancy socks too long (boo!), so have to rip them down a few inches.  I decided to bake something new for the barn crew and, as I went online to peruse baking sites, I realized that I had an entire cookbook collection that I never use.  Down with the electronics and into the bookcase.  I came across this gem:Given to my Great Aunt Edie by a friend.Back before computers - yes,in the time of dinosaursLove this foreword - typewrittenand in much more formal languagethan we typically use nowTrue to the late 50s and early 60s, it leans heavily on canned goods, shortening and isn't shy about introducing bologna as an appetizer.  However, I found a great, simple recipe for a layered coffee cake that I whipped up for the guys.  It got the All Thumbs Up.  I found a couple of other recipes that sounded intriguing, so they will go into the rotation.It was also my weekend to cook dinner for my neighbor.  I rummaged in the freezer and came up with the last package of ground beef and a package of ground pork.  I decided to make spaghetti and meatballs because I have enough canned tomato products for a regiment.  I managed to use three pints of herb tomato sauce and a quart of diced tomatoes!  Woot!  Only 150 jars to go!More wonderful smellsNeeding something bread-like to go with the pasta, I made gluten free bread sticks.  I used my easy-peasy bagel recipe and just made flatish sticks.  They weren't bad.  Topped with Trader Joe's EverythingBut the Bagel sprinklesI made tapioca pudding, too, but didn't get a picture of it because tapioca is, well, tapioca.  It went out the door with my neighbor.  My mother used to make it as a treat, being sure to embellish it with a maraschino cherry on top.  She was big on maraschino cherries - one of our favorite salads was the \"lighthouse\" salad - a leaf of iceberg lettuce, topped with a ring of pineapple, scoop of cottage cheese, half a banana, with a maraschino 'light'.Just as I was settling in for an evening of New Tricks on the DVD player, accompanied by more knitting, I realized that Peanut and Lovey were crammed on the far end of their sofa - as far away from their usual preferred corner as possible.  Sigh.  Upon inspection, someone had barfed on the cover, pillow and sofa itself.  I suspect Lovey, who tends to eat outside things that she shouldn't.  DVD watching was put aside so that much laundry could be done.  There is no rest for the parent of dogs."},

That just leaves finishing one sock in the pair for my sister, one and a half socks for me and most of another pair for me.  And the mittens.  I am already chomping at the bit to cast on three more things and am trying to control certain disaster.  I will have plenty of time to knit this holiday weekend because we are forecast to get upwards of two feet of snow.  Oh, joy.  I will be knitting and shoveling.  Then the temperatures are plummeting Monday night into double digits below zero.  The fun never stops.For those of you not familiar with thrummed mittens (and, really, why would you be?) here is an example:Outside and inside of thrummed mittens.Source is the Yarn Harlot.As you can see, once these are done, I will have very toasty hands.  The fleece 'thrums' are inside your nice, warm woolen mittens and create a rather custom warm cushion as you wear them.  They also felt slightly, to make them even better for cold weather wear.  Of course, I may not have them done before summer, so they are only a warm glimmer this winter.  I have promised myself that I can cast on something new, once I finish my sister's socks.  I am fighting my urge to knit nothing but my new shiny thing - my toe-up, two-toned, fancy-schmancy pattern socks that I cast on Christmas Eve.  I am trying to learn as many new methods as possible this year.  Anything to help pump up those flabby brain cells.It's all I want to knit!Tomorrow is another fully-scheduled day, what with all the pre-Snowmeggedon prep work (clear the barn door so I can do more than squeeze through, shovel poop, stack hay in a more user-friendly manner, add shavings to the coop, clean out the quail trays, pick up the large, economy size bottle of Aleve, spray the roof rake with cooking oil - you know, the usual), parental visit, wash and gas up the car, haircut, recycling/trash stop, and pick up local lettuce.  Then it's time for Hunkerville.  I see a vat of soup in my future, along with some decent bread.  I hate to admit it, but I really did dislike that pricey loaf and fed it to the chickens.  Gah.If I can, I will post horrifying photos of mountainous snowfall (sorry, Joyce...)"},

(Insert sound of mad scrambling and too-long toenails on vinyl flooring)  Ha, you guys don't even know I'm slipping you a mickey (Benedryl for Binkers and pain pill for Lovey) because you DON'T CHEW!\"Looks down to see Slimmie, who has inserted himself between the dogs and waits, expectantly.\"Of course you want a cheezie, Slimmie.  It's Velveeta, you heathen.\"  Slimmie takes his bit of cheezie and gums it madly.  (Insert another, longer sigh).I am lucky that both dogs are not picky - AT ALL - about what they eat.  As long as it's forthcoming in a steady stream, they are happy.  Slimmie is just a homie with a homie's taste.  Our favorite Santa Claws from PA sent him a packet of very special treats for Christmas - freeze-dried minnows!  After he got over his initial fear of them, he then tentatively took one in his jaws and walked around with it for a half hour, growling.  Unfortunately, by then it had thoroughly rehydrated and fell to pieces and he lost interest.  The Binkers was on it like a cheap suit.  That dog can hear the lid of the whipped cream can flip off, or the whisper of minnow pieces falling on carpeting and be there in an instant.  I can stand on the back deck and yell his name (and many other 'colorful' names) in full voice, and he cannot hear me.  It's a mystery (to no one).*****So, how did I spend my Tuesday night?  I'm so glad you asked!  I spent my Tuesday night making a tarp slipcover for the Quail Hutch.  This should come as no surprise from the same woman who fashioned an apron out of duct tape.  I had carefully measured it (more than twice), cut out all of the pieces and duct-taped them together, being careful to duct tape the hems - as is done in The Trade.  Then I realized that I had to put it on the hutch to finish the corners.  Ah.  There was just one tiny problem with that - heavy snow and gusty winds.  While this should have taught me that procrastination has a heavy price, it won't.  I am doomed to repeat my limitations forever.  Amen.  I did manage to slip it over the hutch (it fit!) and then had to bungee the sides down.  Now that I am so close to finishing it, I am sure we will have some sort of awful weather every single day until spring, so I can't complete it.  I will take a picture of it at some point - when I can get over flagellating myself...  We're bracing for Arctic temperatures for almost a week - joy.  That means the wool blanket curtains are back in the coop as of tonight - I have to work in the dark so as not to be blind-sided by The Jerk.  Wish me luck."},

(Bad me!  Bad!)  However, I will just stiffen the upper lip and knit on.  I have made a vow to not buy any more yarn this year.  (I must have caught myself in a weak moment.)Not true to color, but it remindsme of knitting a Monet!I did knit one tiny object this Christmas, but did not get a picture of it - not surprisingly, I was knitting it up to the very last moment and had to throw it in an envelope and get it in the post.  Maybe its recipient will kindly post a pic?  Hmmmm?  (MP....)  As in most things that catch my fancy - recipes, yarn, patterns, shiny objects - I do not bother to check the details.  Heck, it's more fun that way.  When I got the pattern for the Little Long Johns, it started with, \"Cast on 12 stitches and divide among four needles.\"  Wha?  I am lucky to be able to handle two at a time, let alone five.  After bruising my brain, trying to adapt the pattern to the magic loop (Don't you love knitting terms?  I do!  Everything is magic in knitting - Magic Loop, Judy's Magic Cast On.), I struggled through it and managed a reasonably good facsimile of the original.(From Susan B. Anderson's website - barrettwoolco.com)I wasn't fancy with the beads - no time!Even though I have multiple projects on the needles, I am going to be adding one.  Mittens.Yes, it was 57 degrees inside.  I turned the heater on after getting the side-eyefrom the dogs.Our weather has gone from rain to freezing so many times, I am now up to Olympic level on Negotiating the Chicken Yard on Frozen Icy Tundra.  The only ones not bothered by all this up and down are the ducks.  They think sliding on their tummies is ever so much fun.And speaking of ducks and, therefore, chickens, Mr. Big Red is on his way to Outsville.  We have had the talk - Who's Boss?  I am. - multiple times, but he is, apparently, dense as a brick.  Plus, he's is a big boy.  Right now his spurs and not fully developed.  Well, I am not waiting around until that day arrives.  Neither is he.  He's attacked me twice and, while I usually give a rooster three tries before they are out, I'm skipping number three in his case.  Next up, Fritz.  If he goes a similar way, that will be it for roosters.  I am tired of having to arm myself every morning.I am also making progress on working through my freezer.  I had my neighbor over for dinner yesterday and made a three-pound meatloaf.  He left with lots of leftovers.  A new recipe that will be moving into Favorites, is Curried Rice and Squash Casserole.  I believe I found it on the Mennonite Girls Can Cook site.  Once again, it struck my fancy and I did not read further than the ingredients.  When I went to assemble it on Saturday, I realized it made a truckload.  Good thing I like it, because I am going to be having it for lunch all week!  Next time, I will cut it in half.I am NOT a food photographer!Sunday morning, I decided to tackle canning some Apple Mincemeat.  Because I have two bushels of organic apples starting to wrinkle up in the root cellar/guest room.  This provided a bucketful of peelings and cores - Norman Sheep's favorite treat.  He had to fight Linden the Fat Woolly Eel and the Old Lady Llama.  I'm glad I was on the other side of the fence.Some hours later, 8 pints were cooling on the counter.  This time, I am going to label everything.  There are still mystery packages in the freezer and I dumped a jar of what I thought was old applesauce in the chickens treat bowl, only to find it was the last jar of mincemeat I had.  I'm not throwing any of THESE out!Back to the chickens - they must know we are creeping toward longer days.  Instead of getting one egg every other day, I am getting one egg every day!  Woot!"},

SUN!  Of course, it was brutally cold, but SUN.SUN on icy trees.I made another batch of sugar cookies for the barn, fed the farm cats and then mixed up some dog treats.  I got so tired of tripping over Lovey, that I lured them away with marrow bones (what would I do without them???)  I got a lot of little jobs done - none of them on The List, of course - and then binge-watched a BBC program on Wartime Farm.  It was a quite satisfying evening.If you bigify, you can see all the bird feedingstations - deck feeder, large hanging feeder, smallerhanging feeder, two suet holders and athistle feeder.  We're covered.I'll leave you with some lovely things and some chicken videos.My lovely surprise card fromMargaretFritz, in all his frizzle glory.Morning coffee catch-upBig RedP.S.  Llamas and sheep love Pfefferneuse cookies, dodgy peel or not."},

I should be able to arrive in the late afternoon on Saturday with six or seven dozen perfect cookies on trays.  Snort.  We all know what the reality will be - a hot mess on trays, along with the baker.  I hope they are spiking the punch.*****On a happier note, I received a little ray of sunshine in my mailbox this weekend.  A very lovely woman who reads my blog, sent the loveliest card!  She said it reminded her of me.  What a wonderful compliment.  There was no return address, so I can't respond in writing with my thanks - if you'd care to email me, I would love to thank you, virtually, in person."},

not enough sun to charge their batteries.  Everyone looks droopy.Remembered to check the oil in my car and it was down to a drop!  Geez.  Put three quarts in and we're good to go to the next oil change.Quail care has been successfully worked into the routine!  There are still a couple of tweaks and then they will be moved to their winter quarters, and we will be totally off the tracks again.There's been a little too much 'romance' in the coop with the two roosters!  One of my older girls was slightly injured by too much (ahem) attention and had to spend a day and night in the hospital ward.  She is fine now and the boys have gotten a talking-to.  Fritz will have to be rehomed.My garden is about 90% ready for winter!  I fear that is about as done as it will get this year.  My third planting of hearty greens in the cold frame are coming along famously.  Most of the raised beds will have to be replaced - a few at a time.  I have rethought the fencing and have decided to go with electric netting, starting in the spring.  I don't have enough hay!  I still am down half of the hay I need for winter and have been dropping none-too-subtle hints to the farmer.  It's so frustrating to be beholding to people for what you need, sometimes.  However, all his corn is now in, so I am hoping to be moved to the top of his list.  I can rest easy with a barn full of hay.My furnace won't be serviced until tomorrow morning!  The forecast for tonight and into tomorrow is low 20s.  Pfft.  I'm so glad my dogs don't go visiting often.  They would be aware that most people do not keep their homes at 58 degrees.  Most people keep their homes warm.  My reasoning of \"The cold will preserve us longer\" would fall on deaf ears.My sister, bless her heart, arrived Sunday morning and helped me clean out the chicken coop!  It was the first time in 13 years that it was fun.  We're trying something different this winter - I put down an old tarp and put shavings on top.  The plan is that we will be able to drag it out, with its stinky load, in the spring.  The hens were highly alarmed at the alien floor.  It took Rhubarb, my brown leghorn, who HAD to lay an egg (one of only two that seem willing to do so) to venture in and break the curse.  (Look!  She's still ALIVE!!!)I got a cold!  Sunday night, after deciding to start the first fire under the brandy-new chimney, I realized I might have picked a less windy day.  The ensuing bursts of smoke irritated my nose and I thought that was why I was blowing it every five minutes.  Wrong-o.  I awoke Monday morning with a full-blown head cold.  At least I hope it's just a head cold, and not the flu.  A head cold will struggle on for a week.  The flu goes on and on.  I have a resume!  Thanks to the diligent and gentle prodding of a talented and generous friend (we'll refer to her as an angel in shepherdess' clothing), my blank stares, lack of words and complete mind-freeze were overcome and she created a wonderful and perfectly-suited-for-me resume.  Such a load has been lifted from my shoulders.Work is exactly the same!  All I can say is that they sent me a new computer - with the latest upgraded operating system, and the crew from HQ said they would see me in November and December.  I am taking that as an affirmative that I will still be employed until the end of the year.  I have decided to stay to the bitter end, as I need the income.  They will give me a reasonable amount of notice, so I will do a more blitzkrieg approach to resume-sending when I have an end date.  Right now, I am sending it out to my network of business friends.  You never know.The Party has been given the heave-ho!  I had invited family and second family (my neighbors and my parents' best friends) to a pre-Halloween party this weekend.  However, due to my germy condition and the diagnosis of spinal stenosis on my second mother, it was deemed prudent to postpone it.  Poop.  I had gathered a number of fun items for a Halloween centerpiece, drawn up an appropriately ghoulish menu and bought 8 pie pumpkins.  Well, the kids and I will enjoy it anyway.  I may just whip up the main course and do a meals-on-wheels thing.  I'd roast and freeze them, but Marianne has been giving me her gorgeous, organic pumpkins on a weekly basis and there is only so much pumpkin a single woman with dogs can use.  I already have two large butternut squashes and a Long Island Cheese pumpkin roasted and pureed and frozen.  I have three pumpkins in the car (all exotic types, from M) and more to come this weekend.  A nice problem to have, no?This weekend I have plans to get the barn ready for the sheep and llama, clean the house and finish the quail hutch.  And about twenty other items that loom large on The List.Whew."},

they needed access through the back wall of the fireplace, which is my bedroom wall.  Giant dust bunnies were tamed and removed.  Five ton mattresses were hefted and dragged.  Furniture was shoved, pushed and (wo)manhandled.  I did draw the line at breaking down my bed frame.  It is solid golden oak, with a 7-foot headboard.  I managed to shove it far enough away from the wall to give them room to work.   I have my limits.The dogs were corralled and given marrow bones.  When the trucks arrived, they got right to work and I will have to say they were prompt, courteous, fast, and tidy.  The sky reminded me of a sodden blanket and we were waiting for the skies to open up and rain to pour down.  They had brought a huge tarp, but I had visions of trails of mud through my living room and bedroom.  For once, the Universe was looking elsewhere.  The skies did, indeed, open up with torrential rains, but not until the deed was done and the crew gone.The new chimney.  In all its $$ glory.Braced and with a cricket (ice guard), the house will fall down around it before it comes apart.  While they were working, I made granola and had pear/apple butter in the slow cooker.  I may have been surrounded by chaos, but it smelled great!  While I was biding my time, I found that the battery in my phone was not holding a charge.  I'd charge it to 100%, unplug it, open an app and watch the juice run down.  Le sigh.  I did a quick Google search about problems with iPhone batteries and found that, indeed, there were a great many people with problems, prompting the threat of lawsuits which, in turn prompted Apple to offer battery replacement at about 50% of the usual cost through December of this year.  I did a quick 'chat' with Apple and found a local-ish place that had an opening at 3.  Bingo!  Out I went in the pouring rain and dropped it off.  As things are now in limbo - as in how long I will be employed - instead of spending my wait time perusing store aisles, I sat in my car, rain pounding down, and listened to my latest book on CD.  ﻿﻿Saturday was a day of Plan Bs.  As I ventured out to put Bunny the Hun in a cat carrier for his Date with Destiny (3 strikes and he was out), I saw the unmistakable hulking forms of sheep in my backyard.  I am still not sure how they got out.  Luckily, I was awake enough (three cups o' coffee since o'dark thirty) to NOT let the dogs out the back!  Wellies and jim jams on, I herded them back to where they belonged.  I did some clean up around the place and then headed to VT, where we were celebrating my mother's birthday for the second time (third time coming up this weekend).  Apparently, our family cannot get enough of birthdays....  As I drove out of my sister's driveway, I heard the telltale 'thump, thump' of a flat tire.  Sure enough, the right driver's side was a pancake.  As I frantically called my Midas guy, a very nice fellow drove up and asked if I wanted him to change my flat.  Why, yes I did.  I caught Vern before the last mechanic left and he agreed to wait for me.  Half an hour later, I wobbled in on the donut and, an hour later, steamed out with two new tires.  This little segue took all the remaining time out of my day, so I only had three minutes to wish Marianne bon voyage on their trip to the UK, then beelined home so I could arrive during daylight.  This also put all the pressure to achieve the must-dos off The List to Sunday.  I am not lying if I say that I started when it was light enough to maneuver outside (6:30ish) and didn't finish until my friends arrived with the roosters, just before dinner time.  All my plans for a fancy-schmancy dinner went out the window and we ended up with a giant pan of roasted vege (everything roastable in my fridge) and steaks on the grill.  They were wonderful and helped me change the brooder bedding, moved my lemon tree indoors, consulted on the adaptation of my hutch, entertained the dogs, and were generally wonderful company.Fritz the Frizzle (top left) and Big Red (bottom right)I'll get better pics when they are out with the girls - next weekend.At 8:30, I collapsed in my chair and was immediately covered in exhausted pups and a relieved cat.  Then I remembered that I had to at least start breaking down the bedroom.  Monday was a trip into the Twilight Zone.  My two ex-colleagues and the new firm they have joined are subleasing part of the office.  This means they work in the front and I am enisled in the back.  Next week I put together my resume because this, to me, is like adding insult to injury.﻿"},
{"title": "Facts.", "date": "Monday, September 24, 2018", "text": "Fact:  It is unwise to drink your coffee from your Calamity mug when assembling anything, let alone something made in China.Fact:  It is unwise to try to hold your drill, screws, two large parts together, then decide to brace up one of those parts without divesting yourself of one of the other objects.  (Bruise on foot caused by dropping drill not pictured.  You're welcome.)Fact:  You will regret speed shopping.Fact:  Chefs from fancy restaurants create recipes that involve many, many pots, pans, utensils, and ingredients because they don't have to clean up after themselves.  Fact:  Blatant Pollyannaism will come back to bite you on your butt.  Big time.*****I started this weekend on a full-steam-ahead theme - if, for nothing else, to divert me from all the crap that is going on.  More on that later (see last fact).  I was going to TRY NEW THINGS.  Ergo:Why is it my menu list is in all capitals, while my shopping list is in initial caps with lowercase?Granted, the bagels are not new - they are a weekly staple - but everything else was new to me.  There was a new twist on the bagels, however.  Whilst going through the supermarket a just under the speed of light - having to squeeze it in between leaving home and arriving a work on time - I failed to notice that I had plucked vanilla flavored Greek yogurt from the plain yogurt slot because, you know, it was too much trouble for the previous shopper to put it back where it came from.  I did manage to squeeze out almost enough from my own yogurt, but had to make up the difference by about a third of a cup.  You could tell.I had picked up a used cookbook entitled \"The Greens\", thinking it was a cookbook about GREENS - kale, chard, spinach.  When I finally cracked it open, I realized it was about a vegetarian restaurant of some renown (not renown to me, however).  There were quite a few recipes that piqued my interest, so I pulled up my BGPs and forged ahead.  After about 10 minutes, it became clear that, while obviously a talented cook, he was not one to take any shortcuts.  No pan should remain clean, no cooking utensil unused.  Gritting my teeth, I decided to inject myself into the recipe, so shortcuts were used (didn't have two days to soak and cook beans in a \"special' broth) and I will say that everything I made was tasty.  But I was washing dishes almost the whole weekend.Eggplant gratin - with canned whitebeans (mine), not bathed in specialbrothI did not take a picture of the spiced potatoes, but they were/are fab!  I served them over sautéed garlic kale and felt absolutely virtuous.The pear crisp came about out of self-defense.  My pear tree, sweet old girl, is absolutely covered in pears!  This is the first time in 13 years under my limited care that she has produced more than four pears.  We got a good, hard wind a couple of times last week, and there were quite a bit of them scattered about.  I did a little research and found a promising recipe for gluten free pear crisp.  It was/is delicious!If you have been keeping track, you will notice that there is no mention of the Pumpkin Scones.  There is a reason for that - I still have to make pumpkin SCONES.  What I made was Irish Pumpkin Soda Bread Scones.  Sigh.  After slipping them into the oven, I started to put away the ingredients and found - to my horror - that I had made them with 2.5 teaspoons of baking SODA, not the baking powder required.  I baked them - they were quite puffy...snort -- and cooled them and added the maple glaze.  Then I trotted them to the barn and confessed.  They were all eaten, which is a reminder that I should not try and pat myself on my back for my baking prowess, as these guys will eat anything with a glaze on it.Clear as mudI managed to find an adaptable (let's hope) rabbit hutch kit that should suffice for the quail over the winter and through the summer - I don't have hopes for much more.  But it was affordable, I had a coupon and a gift card that reduced the price even more.   At first I was pleasantly surprised - all the hardware was present and in separate packets and there weren't a million steps.  This can be both a good thing, and a bad thing.  What started out well, quickly went downhill.  I admit that at least half of the blame is my lack of patience and focus.  Ergo, the bruised foot. (See Fact 1 and 2).  I should have picked a more positive coffee mug...but, but... I love it!I took the assembly as far as it made sense and then stopped before even more calamities befell me.  I am switching out roosters (Mr. Bunny has attacked me once too often) with my friends of the very handy persuasion and they are going to come to my aid this next weekend.  This is where it stands (besides in my living room):The Butter Pat (aka Peanut) continues to prove that the smaller they are, the more expensive they are.  We celebrated his 4th birthday on Saturday with me shelling out $70+ more on new meds.  He is, as we say where I'm from, a hot mess.  The good news is that his back is healing, which has him all fired up (good/bad).   His allergies came roaring back a mere two weeks after his allergy shot.  To hold us over until his follow-up appointment (in which I have - strongly - requested we start looking at WHAT is causing his allergies, as opposed to throwing meds at him), he's on prednisone for five days.  I feel infinitely sorry for him, locked in his crate 90% of the day, so we have been sharing the chair in the morning from 3-6, when I start the morning chores.  This has thrown Slimmie for a loop, as he is Mr. Velcro when I am sitting.  I've promised him evenings.  Kids.On a bright note, I hung my stained glass sun in the window - it makes me smile every time I look at it - even at night!Now, for the Pollyannaism reference.  As you all know from following me these..eight years...good grief...I tend toward the positive at all times.  No matter what.  I have found that it has served me well because you feel a whole lot better if you take the time to find the positive in any dire situation.  I had been reflecting, not so long ago, at how lucky I was to be working with the two other people in my office because we were all low-key and had formed a little tribe.  Well, I was wrong.  In a big way.  The day after Labor Day, I was informed by the head of this little tribe that she had quit and was taking #2 tribe member with her.  In other words, I had been kicked to the curb.  After 20 years in this job (through two mergers and countless idiots), the end is near.  The prospect of having to work up a resume, schlep my sorry ass out to interviews, where I would have to convince people that, even though I had a plan to retire in two years, I would be worth the investment.  To make things even more angsty (if that is not a word, it should be), this is what I've heard from HQ *insert crickets* so I have no idea when, where or what.  I am like my dogs - I need the sturdy underpinnings of routine to make my world right.  It seems, however, that this Pollyannaism has become an integral part of my DNA.  I keep interjecting moments of pure, happy power that a CHANGE IS COMING, HURRAY!!!  This tends to dip into hand-wringing.  So, fasten your seatbelts.  I am."},
{"title": "Precocious.", "date": "Monday, September 17, 2018", "text": "Three days ahead of scheduleAs I stood in my kitchen Saturday afternoon, listening to the frantic peep of something outside (I thought), I happened to glance down at the incubator and - a quail had hatched!  Three days ahead of schedule!  Out of the 18 eggs I received from Alchemist Farm (I can't say enough good things about them), 9 eggs have hatched as of this morning.  Two more have pipped, so there may be more.One seems to have a problem with splayed legs, but the rest are thriving.  I had forgotten how fast they move!  The only safe way I can move them from incubator to brooder is in a little bucket with a towel laid loosely on the top.Hot, humid weather has revisited us (will it NEVER go away?) so not much has been done outside.  We are waiting for the arrival of the remnants of Florence tomorrow.  Sweater #1In my quest to get things finished, I blocked Sweater #1 - my green, lace weight cardigan that I love.  I will, however, never again knit a sweater in lace weight yarn.  Sweater #2 will be blocked tonight and then I can move onto socks - my comfort knitting.My latest obsessionI scored some donut pans and now I am doing all thing donut.  I've made GF Vegan Pumpkin donuts (pictured above) and Apple Cider donuts (not pictured but almost identical looking to the GFVPs).  I give the GFVPs a solid \"meh\".  They are way too 'wet', if you know what I mean.  The Apple Cider donuts were given to the barn crew and disappeared in about a nanosecond.  I did not coat them with more sugar, as they had plenty of sugar in the mix.  Next week, it's chocolate donuts!  Whee!Looking ahead at the weather forecast, our hot weather is finally going elsewhere and I have to start thinking about moving tender perennials inside.  My sister gave me a beautiful mandevilla that needs to be over-wintered inside and I still have to decide whether or not I will be overwintering my geraniums for another winter.  Frugal me says, yes.  It's going to be a little crowded with everyone jammed in - there's the lemon tree and the fig tree, too.  We'll be nice and cozy...Speaking of cozy, Slimmie has reached maximum relaxed mode...﻿"},
{"title": "Down Periscope!", "date": "Monday, September 10, 2018", "text": "I took a couple of days off last week, both to recover from the previous week and because I had some appointments that would have made it too hectic to be here, there, everywhere and in the office.  Peanut Butter - also know as The Pat - was whisked off to the vet on Thursday.  This is now part of my daily ritual:﻿The one on the left is Lovey's...He managed to, once again, injure a disc in his mad dashing about with the Evil Fly.  We also celebrated the first anniversary of his adoption.  Boy, it seems a whole lot longer than a year - and many of hundreds of dollars under that little bridge.  He is on two pain killers and a muscle relaxer, and is confined - once again - to his crate.  The good news is that Lovey seems to be making progress in healing her torn ACL!   Woohoo!  We take good news where we can.Since I had a little extra time off, my sister and I met at The Clark and took in a couple of new exhibits.  Our favorite was up the hill behind the museum at a lovely, new space, where we sat mesmerized for quite a while, hooked on the swaying and rustling of Jennifer Steinkamp's birch trees in her Blind Eye exhibit.  It was another hot, humid day, but we decided to opt out of the air-conditioned shuttle and we sauntered off down the trails through the woods to the main museum complex.The Lunder Center at Stone HillLovely view... :)﻿Trail down the hill, through the woods and to the main museumWe then went into Williamstown and had a very nice lunch at a Thai restaurant and caught up on recent events and Dad care.  She is a treasure.I spent the next day weeding and filing - obviously doing penance for some horrendous crime against the Universe, for which I am apparently getting my comeuppance.  Because of this new bump in the road, I will be only posting sporadically, so I thought it only fair to warn you - and it is not due to health problems, my little petals, just in case you were worried.  Oh, no.  Just a non-ending yuk-fest the Universe is having at my expense.I leave you with my new posh, fancy-schmancy fuel tank enclosure.  It just warms the cockles of my heart to be able to reuse something of this magnitude.  I had inherited a friend's old deck awning - in perfect shape, just faded.  I've had this in storage for years and, after last year's winter beating, the cheap-ass tarps that come from China, cost a pretty penny and don't last worth a damn, had shredded off the enclosure.  My \"new\" one has scalloped edges!  How fun!  Excuse the dirty 4x4 holding the long edge down - by the time I finished (with the help of my trusty 84 y/o neighbor), we were both beat and just grabbed the first thing that came to hand.  I have to tell you that it just cheers me up when I go out the back and catch sight of it!I love the scalloped edges!Whimsy AND function!I will pop up and post when I can - and will try and keep up with all your writings as well. xo"},

{"title": "The cake dilemma.", "date": "Thursday, August 23, 2018", "text": "I have finally found a good, moist, tasty, fairly long-lasting gluten free cake.  An added plus is that it contains zucchini...However.A very technical drawing*The first time I made this gluten free zucchini breakfast cake (sweetened not by sugar, but maple syrup - the pluses are adding up), it was a rather convoluted affair.  I wanted to make it, but didn't have enough of a consecutive chunk of time to go from A to Baked in one go.  So I divided the process up thusly:  measure out dry ingredients into a bowl.  Three days later, add wet ingredients and put in prepared baking pan.  Realize almost immediately that I had left out the melted coconut oil, pull the pan out of the oven, dump the batter back into the mixing bowl, furiously stir in the melted oil, wash and reline baking pan, put back in oven.  I was greatly relieved to find it nice and risen and moist and delish.  (Exhibit B)HoHA!  Sez I.  I'm going to make it again and THIS time I'm going to make sure I have a nice, uninterrupted (hahahahaha) chunk of time so that there is no forgetting nuthin.  And, thusly, I did so.However, upon removing the baked cake from the oven, I discovered Exhibit A.The leavening agent is baking powder with a catalyst of baking soda.  I have been baking for a fair amount of time and although I am not of a scientific nature, I do know that, if you add your carefully measured ingredients (all in-date, nothing expired or close to being so), you should get similar if not identical results.  Same oven.  Same weather conditions, same Moon moving into the path of Saturn.  I also know that, leaving baking powder/soda to sit within a batter can sometimes enhance the rise - but the trick is BATTER, not a pile of dry ingredients.So, my dears, you of the high baking skills, what happened?  I am hoping to make many more of these cakes because they freeze well and, you know, zucchini.  But I would much rather freeze the cake kind of cake as opposed to the pancake kind of cake.  Thoughts?  xoxoxo(Both exhibits were equally tasty.  Ergo the technical drawing.)"},

One thing is not like the others.", "date": "Wednesday, August 15, 2018", "text": "I have been trying to focus on reading more during my 'down' time - say, 3-5A.   Since I tend to obsess, I am slowly easing off the knitting (one sweater 99.9% done, second sweater 90%, scarf/shawl too boring to spend too much time on, socks on the needles).  I can feel myself being drawn towards my BritBox subscription (curse you, Marianne), so I am tempting myself with a stack of physical and virtual books - the latter of which maintains my sanity during my daily commute.Right now, I am listening to Rough Beauty by Karen Auvinen, a memoir that was enthusiastically referred by Bestie, Sylvie.  I couldn't find it via Libby, my library's audiobook app that allows you to borrow audiobooks from your library for free, so I got it on Audible.  The nice thing about Audible is that you can test listen - very important because a narrator can make or break a book's enjoyment.  I cringingly remember listening to Jane Eyre, where the male narrator took it upon himself to read Jane's parts in a piercing falsetto, or the recent horror read in HIGH DRAMA.  As I have listened to Rough Beauty, I've been swept up with Auvinen's words - with her, you are facing the mountains in Colorado, seeing the swathe of spring flowers and hearing the birds, or sitting in a cabin while the winter winds roar.  She is what I always wanted to be in my heart of hearts - fierce, independent, brave.  I am bracing myself, as I've reached the part where her companion of many years, a fine dog of the Husky persuasion, is reaching the end of his life.  I will most likely have to pull off to the side of the road to get through that or listen to it at home.For home reading, I am savoring Inland Island, by Josephine Johnson.  This book is out of print - Amazon refers to it as a Story Press endangered classic.  I found my copy through Thriftbooks.  This is also about a woman's observations of nature, but in a totally different voice.  Her language is fierce, amazing and true.  It is not the carefully, albeit lovingly, crafted prose of Auvinen's, but a language that is so completely pure that it's breathtaking.  Descriptions that make your mind take a sudden seat - BAM!  There are whole paragraphs that I have marked with the ever-handy Post-It notes that I want to memorize so that I can summon them up when I want to be reminded how really beautiful words can be.  I will never dismiss the miracle of a lady beetle again.I still have to face my knitting - my summer-weight green cardigan needs to have its ends woven in and be blocked.  I am quite happy with it.  My worsted weight steel-grey sweater is continuing to challenge me, which I am enjoying immensely.  I had made the mistake of starting an easy knit for waiting rooms, etc., instead of my usual sock project.  Mistake.  It is so mind-numbing that I am loathe to pick it up.  It may be mouldering in its project bag for years.  I have a big list of sock gift-giving so I had better get cracking.  No matter how hard I try to ignore it, the days are getting shorter.  Summer is sprinting by - or should I say flowing by.  We have had over six inches of rain since the beginning of August - the opposite end of the spectrum to our friends on the left coast.Thanks to friends with gardens, I have had zucchini crust pizza, zucchini fritters, zucchini and sweet corn pie, zucchini breakfast cake.  I am planning on an eggplant Parmesan this weekend, along with more fritter-making, as these freeze well and are a nice, quick dinner when you are mired in February.  Another batch of gazpacho is on the near horizon.  It's nice to be awash in vege - although I do miss growing it myself.  Next year.  Next year."},

{"title": "Reining in my plastic life.", "date": "Friday, July 6, 2018", "text": "I made a pledge to do my best to make July a No-Plastic month.  As is usually the case, I presumed it would be a snap.  Wrong-o.  Plastic has invaded every nook and cranny of my life.  It is in/on/with/made of everything I touch, it seems.After coming to grips with this fact, I decided that I would aim for not bringing any plastic into my home for a month.  The upside of this is that a) I will save money and b) it will stretch my creative abilities to their max.  I have been keeping track of how things are packaged over the last few months, as I got ready for the challenge.  It's sort of like jogging in place before a marathon, without the ibuprofen.  I would say that 99.9% of anything I ordered online came with some sort of non-recyclable, plastic packaging.  A few were pretty creative themselves.  I got some adorable mugs from Calamity Ware and they came in a veritable Matryoshka of cardboard boxes; a total of 4 boxes, nesting tightly within each other, with the mugs individually wrapped in plastic in the final box.  Then there was the book that was heavily wrapped in plastic bubble wrap and enclosed in a bubble wrap mailing envelope.  I ordered a used copy of Plastic Free - How I Kicked the Plastic Habit and How You Can Too.  Ironically, it arrived in a plastic dust cover.  When I go to the grocery store, the majority of items I tend to buy are packaged in plastic.  If I am not right on top of the people manning the checkouts, everything would be triple bagged.   I already schlep my reusable bags to every store I frequent.  If I forget them, I have to come up with creative ways to juggle purchases to the car (pockets are my life).  Then there are the epic fails - like my experience ordering frozen dog food (each package came in it's own giant box, lined with Styrofoam - my nemesis - containing dry ice).  I've gotten the packaging fairly well under control on that end, ordering a freeze-dried, human-grade food that is in a box.  In a  plastic bag in a box.  However, it looks as though I will be buying only used furniture.  I have been looking for a storage unit to help organize my craft/yarn/office room make-over,  for quite some time.  I found the perfect one, on sale, at a big box store in May.  It had to be ordered, so I did so.  Had I ordered it in July, I would have had to send it back as soon as I opened the box and looked inside - it was a plasti-phobe's nightmare.Damn Styrofoam againIn an interesting twist - my local Wal-Mart (which I usually avoid like the plague) was the only place I could find organic fish emulsion fertilizer (in a plastic bottle).  They also are one of the few establishments that will take your plastic bags for recycling - they sell themselves as very 'green'.  However, when I got to the checkout, the woman refused to put my purchases in the bag I brought.  I had to do it myself.  It's not that I mind bagging my own, but really?  I don't think that the corporate message has trickled down.  The only reason I will enter the store again, is to use their bag recycling.I needed to get cheddar, but cannot buy it at the grocery because it is in a plastic-wrapped block.  I did a little calling around and found two local places that carry large wheels of cheddar that I can get cut to order and wrapped in paper.  Score!  It costs more, but it is worth it in the long run, me thinks.  The upside about all this mental canoodling, is that I find myself thinking of creative solutions to all kinds of things.  I was watching a podcast about a young woman and her family who homestead in Arkansas, and I was admiring her gardening/harvesting apron.  I looked it up online and it was pricy.  I think I can make my own rendition at a fraction of the price.  The wheels have already started turning.  After all, I finally remembered how to thread my sewing machine.If I can stem the inflow of plastic and reuse what I already have accumulated until it falls apart (but never goes away), I will rest easier.  I grew up (my teenagish years) at the dawn of Earth Day.  Those principles have stuck with me ever since and the one thing that stands out most starkly in my mind is the fact that there is no Away, as in throwing something away.  It goes somewhere.  Unfortunately, it often goes into the oceans and streams and rivers.  It goes into landfills.  It is blown to the sides of the road, up in tree branches.  This is a finite planet.  There are already too many people on it and those people are creating too much trash.  If more people would become aware of the amount of plastic trash they are generating for future generations - as in all their kids/grandkids/great-grandkids - maybe the trend will turn.Hope springs eternal.If you are interested in joining in, here is the link."},

{"title": "Wild Thangs", "date": "Monday, June 25, 2018", "text": "If this morning's commute is any kind of a precursor of events to come this week, hold onto your hat!  I had to stop for:  wild turkeys; BEAR CUBS; porcupine; deer; grouse.  While four of the five are reasonably common, bear cubs are not.  I was laboring up my mountain (CLOSE TO HOME) when I spotted what I first thought were obese Labradors.  While I was tsking their owners for a) letting them get to that state and then, b) letting them run loose, a tiny voice in the back of my brain pan said - dogs : no / bears : yes.  They scampered into the woods before I got close enough to see their beady eyes.  Which is probably a good thing, as they seemed young enough to still have their mama close by.  After hearing the story about a woman (on the same mountain) having her car attacked and totaled by a cow moose with a bad attitude, I was in no mood to hang around to see if she would come along.I got so much done this weekend!  Woot, woot, woot!  Of course, only about half of it was on The List, but it still counts.  Because I added, then crossed off all the extraneous stuff.  I do not consider it cheating, since you asked.The weather was sort of crummy on Saturday, as the Big Rain forecast for our area dissolved into dribbles on and off all day.  I did a drop-off run to the local food pantry (reducing the clutter in my laundry room significantly, as it's the only safe place to store food stuffs in a house that contains the Flying Sausage, aka Butters), picked up 100# of poultry feed from the local supplier, then headed home and hit the ground running.  With help from my neighbor and his trusty chainsaw, all the sumac trees were taken down in the section of the chicken yard that was fenced off for grass rejuvenation.  Then another hour was devoted to clearing the debris, followed by another hour of yoinking weeds, then another two and a half hours were spent with shovel, pickax, trowel and iron bar, trying - to no avail, alas - to dig out an oak tree seedling and move it to its new home.  After following a large tap root (with no extraneous root system) for more than a foot and a half, the root zigged east and south and there was no way I could extract it.  I was quite unhappy about it, as I love trees and had hoped to move it out of the flower bed close to the house to the new, grassy oasis in the back.  At least I have a hole ready for a potential tree.  I will have to start keeping my eyes open for a likely candidate.By the time I threw in the trowel/shovel/pick/rod, I was mud from head to toe, as rain drizzled on me the entire time.  The temperature on Saturday didn't rise above 60 degrees, so it was pure heaven to go inside and peel off the wet clothes, shower and put on nice, dry everything!  The dogs spent a contented day, gnawing on their marrow bones and watching me labor in the rain from the dry coziness of their sofa.  There were many other small things ticked off the list - repair mirror chain, put a new layer of shavings in the duck hut and nesting boxes, switch poultry waterers (which I can now fill from my rain barrel!!!), weed the garlic, repair another window screen, etc., etc.  I hit bed early and didn't move until 4A.Sunday, I was out by 6:30, as there was more rain forecast for the day.  I made four wheelbarrow runs, clearing out all the weeds I pulled from the grassy plain in back.  I also noticed that the platform on which I had balanced my rain barrel had partially collapsed from the weight.  You know those times when you do something sort of half-assed and you know it's half-assed and will probably end in a bad way, but you do it anyway because you're in a hurry/lazy?  I did manage to prop up one end with part of a cement block and will have to wait until it's empty again (how ironic) to fix it.  I am sure we will now be inundated with rain because I need it empty.I then loaded my car with various flotsam and debris that I have been collecting and zipped off to the transfer station.  Where they were having their coffee and couldn't help me unload.  Harumph.  I was then off to Marianne's for my farm stint.  We weeded and fertilized everything in the greenhouse (she has fist-sized tomatoes!), admired her ducks and then headed in for an iced coffee and a nice chat.  I really do love these 'work' days.  I was back home in time for the rain, so focused on the inside of the house.  I did get my mirror chain rehung - I love it so much, Joyce! - and then vacuumed, swept, cleaned bathrooms, and made a grass fed beef/Marianne's mushrooms ragout with GF mushroom noodles for dinner.  Yummo!  I did not bake one thing this weekend.  I'm sure the barn guys are in shock (or mourning), but I took the day off.  My latest favorite DVD series is New Tricks and two DVDs arrived in Saturday's post!  Huzzah!I awoke this morning feeling virtuous.  I also awoke way too early because someone (SLIMMIE) managed to get my bedroom door open and I was wide awake at 2:30.  I put in two hours on my sweaters (yes, I am knitting tandem sweaters because I am certifiable), then cleaned up the kitchen, washed eggs and made my lunch using the swag I picked up on Sunday:Spinach, beet microgreens, my lettuce, cilantro microgreens, shaved sweet onion, Kalamata olivesI also made a kale/spinach quiche over the weekend for lunches.  Speaking of swag - I swaggered past the only large mirror I own and was abhorred to catch a glimpse of myself - egad.  So a strict food regimen has been handed to me by me.  Swagger, indeed.  More like, Run!  Run away!  If nothing else, the exercise would do me good..."},

This gave me the opportunity to overwork on Sunday - see?  I didn't remember and no one reminded me.  I am not safe on my own.Fence work is to start this week.  Supposedly, but I will believe it when I see it.  In the meantime, I picked up a mineral block for the sheep and they were thrilled and it will keep them occupied for at least half of the week.A neighbor very generously gave me plant starts from her lovely garden.  At 5:30 on Sunday afternoon.  Sigh.  I had just spent from 8:30 - 5:15 weeding and planting and cleaning up.  I watered her plants well and put them in shade.  I hope they can hold up until I can squeeze in time to plant them.  We had spent a lovely 20 minutes in her peaceful backyard with a glass of wine (from 5:30-5:50 on Saturday -- see?  I'm now micromanaging my social time...) where we both bemoaned the fact that, since we are single, have homes, work full time, we never have time to do anything except on weekends.  This proves my theory that people may listen to you, but they don't hear you.  Ergo, she shows up at the end of my weekend with six plants that need to be put in the ground.  I still don't know where I'm putting four of the six plants, but I guess I'll figure that out.Saturday night I baked a rhubarb pie, using a Martha Stewart recipe that was easy to adapt to GF.  It sure was a mess, but YUM!  Of course, it was a mess because I followed the recipe for a normal 9\" pie crust and all pre-made GF crusts (as well as any type of baked good) is much smaller.  So you can be sure you are paying wa-a-a-a-y more for it than a regular pie crust (or any baked good).  Nevertheless, it was delicious.  I will make another for the local library's Pie a la Mode celebration during the Fourth of July parade.  Maybe I'll go crazy and make one of each - GF and normal.Thank goodness it was on foil AND parchment,or I'd be eating it off the baking tray...I also did my variation of Hawaiian burgers on Sunday, in my effort to spruce up my eating habits on the weekend (as in a balanced meal).  My version consists of ground pork, minced scallions, ginger, allspice, s/p, grilled and topped with reduced Balsamic vinegar and a grilled slice of pineapple on top!  I added grilled asparagus and oven baked sweet potato fries.  I forced myself to forgo pie for dessert...The garden is finally taking shape - this is the latest ever.  However, we do need rain - badly.  I think I may have jinxed us by putting in a second rain barrel.  I have enough rain in the original barrel to water the garden judiciously for another week or so.  There isn't a solid forecast for rain in the next 10 days, though.  Let's hope they are wrong!You can see how close the trucktraffic is.About 90% of the worst weeds are gone.  Threeareas are going to be covered in weed cloth/cardboard/whateverso that I have a fighting chance next year.Currant bushes are laden with future fruit!Biggify to see the blueberries.This seems to be a good year for fruit (excuse me while I turn around six time, rapidly, counter-clockwise, speaking Dutch and twirling a baton - just to take the jinx off that last statement...)"},

{"title": "OMGIM!! ", "date": "Monday, June 4, 2018", "text": "I have written myself a note that I will NOT work myself into such a state on Sunday, that I am comatose at 7P.  I am sure that note will get lost in the mail between now and next weekend, but I always have good intentions.Saturday was spent mainly in the car.  I had to take Princess Pea (aka Layla) to an adoption event an hour away.  This entailed rushing around like a crazy person to get sheets on the line, doing chores, moving the sheep to another bit of greenery, taking down the electric fencing, giving PP her Dramamine for the trip, trying to look less bedraggled than I was and heading out through weekend traffic into a shopping strip mall.  Only marginally less loathsome (in my mind) than an enclosed mall.  When we arrived (PP having only thrown up a little) right on time, no one from the rescue group was there.  I am learning that they operate on Island time.  Or Rescue time.   And this is nothing against these great people, as they all give up their weekend/weekdays to help dogs find great homes.  I just need to relax.  (hahhahahhahheeehehhee)  It was a little chaotic because the pet store was also holding a vaccination clinic.  Princess Pea did her darnedest to prove she is the sweetest dog ever, walking on her hind legs, little front paws waving.  She did have some mild interest - and you'll have to excuse me because I am going to go on a bit of a ranting aside...*****What is with people?  Why on GGE do they recognize that she is adorable, trained, loving, sweet tempered and then totally lose interest because she's a 'senior'?  Seriously?  And what?  She's ten, she's a small dog, she's healthy.  She can live another 5-8 years.  When I adopted the best dog in the Universe - Scrappy Doo - he was 9.  And he was a medium-large dog.  I had him in my life for almost another 9 years!  These senior dogs are perfection.  And, if not perfection, they deserve special treatment.  They deserve the very best of EVERYTHING.  I am, of course, glad that none of these people adopted her because, clearly, they don't deserve her.  I'm done.  For the moment.Seriously, what is not to loveabout this dog?*****Unfortunately, due to a large list of things that had to get done, PP and I were only able to stay for an hour and a half.  I did get to meet a few of the rescue volunteers that I had never met in person, so that was nice.  Another Dramamine for the trip home - she is such a little trooper - and I dropped her off, picked up Mr. Butters, and headed for a local humane society another 40 minutes in the opposite direction.  I had placed an order from Chewy.com and it had been erroneously delivered to them.  Apparently, Chewy.com automatically pulls up and delivers to the last address, even though that address is used, say, once a millennium.  Anyway, the humane society was very nice about it and held my package and Chewy.com gave me a credit for the inconvenience.  They are a great group to deal with.  I took Butters with me because he needed to get out of the house and Lovey is still struggling with her torn CCL.  Butters is a very good traveling companion and it was nice to have some Mom/Pup one on one time.  I retrieved my box, was impressed with the facility and staff, and headed home.  Butters and I took a short detour to share a small soft-serve ice cream cone (he got the cone and half of the ice cream).  Back at home, I ticked off a few of the to-do's on my list and spent a lot of time watering.  At the top of that list was adapting my second rain barrel.  Done!A converted Kalamata barrel -the chicken's water will smelllike a Greek salad for days!Sunday was the last firehouse breakfast with the Boys, then off to Marianne's farm for my work-for-vege.  She went to a graduation, so I was left with my task of weeding the greenhouse and got to revel in the beauty of the place.  It sits high on a hill, with a sweeping vista.  It is quiet and there is nothing but birdsong, some lowing of the Highland cows and distant chicken noises.  It is pure Nirvana.On the way to the greenhouseThere she is!View from the greenhouse, orchardbetween﻿Hugelkultur beds, through theorchard, to the pool.Barn with raised beds withstrawberries - be still my back!Scottish Highland cowsWhy is it that it's so much more fun to weed someone else's garden?  Of course, their farm is organic and planted on permaculture principles, so I am sure that has something to do with it - nothing like a well-organized, beautiful farm to make labor such a joy!  I managed to get four trug-fuls of weeds pulled and picked up my swag (shiitake and oyster mushrooms, microgreens, tons of mixed greens) made a stop and then hit the ground running when I got home.  I did more laundry in anticipation of an upcoming rainy couple of days, weeded a large bed, took down the fencing around the duck village and moved it into position across the chicken yard.  Two years ago, just as the grass started to come back in the yard, we got about two weeks of torrential rain, followed by high temperatures and drought.  It was enough to kill all of the grass.  I am now in the process of cordoning off portions of the yard so that I can bring the grass back.  Not an easy process, due to the nature of chickens (scratch everything to death!)  I also finished setting up the rain barrel, got the laundry off the line and helped my neighbor load his truck with a bunch of metal crap that had been getting on my nerves for years.  This is shaping up to be the year of the Great Clean Up.  Let's hope so - it feels so, so virtuous and good.  I did not get pictures of my modest garden or the reseeding process because my arms were too tired to hold up my phone.  Egads.  The dogs and I had our dinner and a nice round of DVD viewing, before I went comatose at 9P.  The rain started at 2:14A (yes, I know it precisely) and the temperature this morning was 44!  Quite a difference from the 80 of yesterday!  The rain was very light and there wasn't much to show in the rain barrel (I will get a pic of it posted this week), but, still, when I plant the grass seed after work tonight, it should be enough to give the new grass a boost!"},

{"title": "Let's review the past five days, shall we?", "date": "Tuesday, May 29, 2018", "text": "While, as usual, I have no pictures - I am so lame in the photography department - I am, however, at no loss for words...Before LD (Lymes Disease), I had decided to take the Thursday and Friday before Memorial Day weekend off.  I decided this because a) given the propensity of my weekends to be rained out, I figured I would get at least two days of non-rainy weather in a five-day stretch; b) I am so behind I am thinking of cloning myself; c) I like the idea of road-testing retirement.  Thursday, I had scheduled my annual auto inspection (only three months late - not bad!) with a new mechanic.  I cannot use my much loved and trusted guy, because he's in Vermont.  Pfft.  However, Fat Body Custom turned out to be great.  No rip-offs, no lies, no padded bills.  I then headed north to VT to do my seriously long list of errands.  I did this on a nice sunny day because - surprise! - I am not allowed outside in the sun because of the Doxycycline.  I tried to squint past my weedy garden on the way to the car, but it didn't work - I slowly weeded my way across the yard and made it into the shade, feeling like a broiled lobster tail.  In VT, I sucked it up and went to Wal-Mart because they are the only retail establishment within reasonable range that carried laundry trees.**Perverse aside here - the last one I bought, ten years ago, was from a local hardware store in Bennington that had been in business and family-owned, for 75 years.  This laundry tree lasted through storms, wind and neglect until this winter.  The arrival in Bennington of both Wal-Mart and Home Depot, put the family-run business out of business.Back we are to Wal-Mart, which was renovated into something the size of a football field, complete with a grocery section.  Right next to our local Price Chopper grocery store.  While I may be forced to buy certain things from WM, I will NOT buy groceries.  Except for gallon containers of Heinz white vinegar, which is the only white vinegar that should be used in the processing of pickles, etc.  No one but WM stocks this.  That said, my laundry tree is made out of such poor material that it's laughable.  While I usually completely forget to fold up the laundry tree and store it for the winter, I had better remember to do exactly that with this piece of Chinese tin, or it won't last two seasons.I then toddled next door - all righteous-like - to Price Chopper and did my monthly shopping.  By the time I got home, I was bushed and the day was more than half over.  I resorted to housecleaning, as the sun was blazing away, with forays out with the pack.  I also amused myself by counting the number of dump trucks that drove to/from the gravel pit.  I believe we averaged one every 3-5 minutes.  That should really be a selling point, when I get around to putting this place on the market.  Maybe they'll run out of gravel...Since I wasn't able to work outside, I decided to purge a few things via Facebook.  One was a  wooden plant stand - el cheapo, but held a lot of plants.  However, I had two and only needed one.  The second offering was a fountain that went out on your deck.  I had gotten it from a local woman for a very reasonable price, but I had only used it once and it was a pain to store - so out it went.Let me just say, as both were put out as free, all the crazy people came out.  I had - I kid you not - 48 messages for the two objects within 10 minutes.  It was like a feeding frenzy!  The problem is, you cannot rely on people to actually show up.  I have learned over the years to sort through all the hyperbole to pick up on key words.  At least half of the people don't really want to go through the effort of having to actually come and get the item - they just want to be first.  I even had one woman who \"LOL\" indicated she would come before the woman who was first in line and take it.  People.  Both objects were gone in a half-hour.**It's okay - this is a musing and not an aside - or it's an aside musing.  The frenzied activity reminded me of my one and only snorkeling excursion on my one and only trip to the Caribbean.  I was bobbing around in my giant t-shirt (I burn easily) gripping the bread that the snorkeling guide had said would 'lure a few fish' in to feed, when I was completely engulfed in a feeding frenzy of dozens (maybe hundreds...visions of Hitchcock's \"The Birds\" came to mind) of pastel-colored fish.  It was equal parts terrifying and fascinating.Friday morning, before the dreaded sun (I never thought I'd say that, after this winter), I geared up and began the war against the chicken coop.  OMG.  I knew it was going to be bad, given the length of the winter and the number of birds, but holeymoley.  I shoveled and shoveled and carted and carted.  Then ducked inside when the sun shifted.  I am also battling the rooster, who seems to have lost his pea-sized mind.  He must have correctly judged my frame of mind, as, while he did give me the hairy-eyeball, he also gave me a wide berth.  I managed to get a third of the coop done before throwing in the shovel.  I then spruced myself and Miss Layla-bell up and we drove to the city for an adoption event.  This involved giving her Dramamine an hour before the car ride, as her little tummy does not do well with all the bounces and turns that mountain driving provides.  We got there in good shape - unfortunately, the rescue didn't manage to promote it so, while it was a nice hour spent with a few nice people, it wasn't worth the drive.  Poor waif was almost green on the way home.**Yet another aside.  I have become such a hermit!  While Troy, NY, is not exactly the cosmopolitan hub of the state, it is a rather charming old city with shops and restaurants and interesting architecture.  And I have never been in it, other than a short trip to the courthouse because of jury duty call-up.  It felt so, so....grown up to be there!Saturday, I was back, shovel in hand, as soon as I could get the hens out of the coop.  I managed to get another third done before I had to go back up to VT to pop in on the folks.  I was then back home to tackle a few items on the to-do list - fence repair, where my neighbor had lost traction and his truck had slid into the wooden chicken yard fence and cracked a couple support boards.  I also weeded madly when the sun went under the clouds.Sunday was perfect.  Very breezy and overcast and rainy all day long.  I headed up to Marianne's farm and we spent a few hours planting vine crops - cukes, squash and pumpkins.  Since neither of us cared if we got wet, it was very enjoyable to spend the time on her beautiful farm, talking and working.  It was also interesting for me, as she does a no-dig method when planting these crops.  We pulled back black plastic that had been keeping the plot weed-free, then rolled out an organic paper in two long rows.  After weighting it down, she went down the line, making a few cuts for root expansion, while I followed with the composted llama beans (yay, llamas!) and dropped a pile on each planting spot.  Then we followed up with organic compost, then planted five seeds in a circle in each mound.  She will follow up later with composted mulch that will protect the plants, further hold down weeds and keep the paper in place.  I drove home with butter lettuce, oyster and shiitake mushrooms, little turnips, microgreens, pea shoots, leeks and a very contented view on life in general.  I was so contented, that I temporarily lost my mind and just continued planting, weeding and general bending, stretching and reaching in ways that had become totally alien over the winter months.  But, what the heck!  The sun wasn't out and I could be outside!!!  I worked steadily through lunch and into early evening.**Again - there must be a switch in my brain that flips off when common sense seems to be edging a little to close to reality...Monday dawned hours after I had dragged my sorry butt out of bed at 2:30A, every muscle and tendon giving me the business.  I sogged out to the living room and tackled my latest knitting project - a summer-weight sweater.**And, yet again!  What was I thinking?  Knitting an entire sweater out of lace weight yarn?  It's like trying to maneuver fuzzy thread on two sticks.  I kid you not.  This might be done for next summer.  Maybe.Since the day dawned overcast, I had to face the final coop onslaught.  I could have given Humphrey Bogart a run for his money in that part on The Amazon Queen when he had to go back in the lagoon with the leeches...  But I sucked it up, pulled on my soggy BGPs and finished it.  I figured it was a total of 10 giant wheelbarrow loads.  I need to come up with a better plan.  LD or not, I'm getting too old for this nonsense.  The ingrates now have a clean coop with a fluffy layer of shavings.  The pure relief of getting it done gave me a little spark of energy, so I did a couple of loads of laundry, hung up my windchimes and mirror chain (thank you, Joyce!!), vacuumed the house, swept up a dog's worth of white hair and cleaned off the dining room table.I am now enjoying the bliss of looking out of office windows that do not showcase weedy beds.  Drab state buildings never looked so lovely!What have y'all been up to?"},

{"title": "No excuses.", "date": "Monday, April 30, 2018", "text": "If I needed an example of what happens when you a) don't follow your instincts; b) think that, if something happened one way before, it will repeat itself; and c) are just plain lazy, I got it in spades this weekend.Saturday was the usual whirlwind of activity - all my errands, a haircut, lunch with the folks, my labor-for-vege time with Marianne, etc.  It had been grey and damp in the morning but - thank you, Universe - it cleared up briefly in the afternoon with blue sky and sun.  Just in time for my farm work!  It then went downhill quickly and, by the time I got home, it was raining.  It rained constantly, making any outdoor activity unattractive.   A neighbor had graciously agreed to pick up some books on CD from the library for me, so I squelched over to pick them up and had a glass of wine and some adult person conversation.  It was very nice.  By the time I got home it was pouring, so I had to force the dogs outside (large umbrella held aloft), feed them, feed the sheep/llama, collect eggs, then feed me.  As soon as it is starting to get dark, the chickens are snug in their coop and I close them up.  The ducks, however, are loathe to go in until it's dark.  I decided to wait until the rain eased up to go out and close them in and then promptly fell asleep in my chair.  I did not think about it again until just after I slipped under the covers.  I decided I was too tired, it was still raining and I had left it open before with no ill effects.  After all, the poultry yard is surrounded by a six-foot wood fence with chicken wire around the bottom.  You can see where this is going.At 2:15A, I heard the ducks - shot out of bed, threw on my robe, got Lovey, slipped into boots and turned the lights on.  Lovey levitated off the deck, snarling with hair raised down her back, towards the fence.  I went out with the headlamp on and my .22 loaded.  A cursory inspection of the duck house showed only one occupant and no sign of the others.  I was too late.  I closed the door, called Lovey off and went inside.  Needless to say, there was no going back to bed.When it was finally light, I went out to survey the damage.  Only Dolly was left and she was frozen in terror, crammed in the back corner of the nesting box.  I went out of the front gate to survey the outside perimeter of the fence and, lo and behold!, there was Dimples, looking terrorized and missing a lot of pin feathers.  I herded her back into the yard and Dolly ventured out only after hearing Dimples.  There was no sign of Cordelia or Gertie.  Not a feather.  There were only a few tiny drops of blood, so I figured it was a pair of foxes.  This was supported by the method of their entry into the yard.It's hard to see in the photograph, but they had dug under the fence, next to the duck coop and under the gate and, thanks to me, had waltzed in the open front door and made off with C & G.  If I had been flexible enough, I would have kicked myself from here to Babylon.  Thanks to my pure laziness and arrogance, I had let them down and my dear ducks paid a heavy price.   Needless to say, the survivors were traumatized and spent the entire day huddled together, as far away from their coop as they could be.  It's interesting in that the chickens, having gone through a hawk attack in their coop, then spending who knows how many hours with the assassin perched on their roost, were over it within an hour or so.  The ducks are still not over it.  It took quite a while and some strategically placed boards to herd them back into their coop.  I had gone up to the hardware store (in Vermont) and reinforced both their door and the chicken coop door.  All in the pouring rain.  On top of that, I had gotten a rather last-minute call from my shearer and I had to scramble around to get the sheep corralled and put in lockdown for his visit this morning.Joe with the fat eel that is Linden.I no longer refer to him as the 'sweet sheep'.  He's a pain.Norman, a Cormo/Pony X, who ISa pain, is a total bean bag for the shearer.Go figure.Dirty but lovely Cormo fleece.As is always the case on shearing day, it rained, it snowed, it was cold, it was damp.  After spending some hours in cold drafty barns (I help with my neighbor's shearing), my feet felt like blocks of ice.  A hot shower, wool socks and a fourth cup of coffee later, I was on my way to the office, feeling like I was coming in from Mars.  As is also always the case, shearing takes about six times longer than you figure.  When I called my boss to let her know I was running (very) late, she wasn't too bothered.  She had taken the day off to spend with her daughters and nieces for a long weekend of spas, chef-catered dinners and farm-to-table breakfasts.  Yeehaw."},

which, no matter how much I like it, I cannot order again because it comes in a plastic pouch, dammit), a glass of wine for medicinal purposes and three episodes of Shetland, I fell into bed, running my list for the weekend on the endless loop.Up and at 'em early, I made my list (in chronological order - I need all the help I can get), then headed out the door in plenty of time.  Everything went south from there.  In my town, if you don't employ an independent trash/recycling pick up service, you take your trash, et al. to the town transfer station.  This is extremely cost effective and they have added better recycling service over the 12 years I've lived here (OMG, 12 years?).  The system consists of purchasing yearly a numbered tag to be displayed in your car, and then tickets to be used, one per bag, for your trash and for anything that goes in the big containers - metal (free), construction and general trash.  These can only be purchased from the town clerk, who works two partial days a week - Wednesday night and Saturday morning.  I pulled into the lot five minutes after she opened and noticed four cars already there.  Never a good sign.  In small towns (at least mine), it is the thing to do of a Saturday, to stand around and talk about this and that with the town clerk, the transfer station team, anyone stationary who will listen.  Instead of the usual in/out service, I was treated to a 20 minute wait while various small indignities and problems were discussed.  It must have been the fact that there was actual sun and it brought everyone and their Uncle Bob out from under their winter rocks.I then had to streamline my list.  I stopped at the transfer station, now officially tagged for the year, and was faced by two long lines of cars and pick-ups, building up behind two old codgers who were chewing the fat with the staff.   I sashayed up to the front and suggested that they move their trucks through and off to the side and THEN continue their conversations so that the rest of us could carry out our business.  They begrudgingly complied and, when I sashayed back to my car, the people in line tooted their horns and waved at me.  Why, I ask you, didn't someone further up in line do this?  They obviously don't live by to-do lists.  I live in a town of complainers, not doers.  Pfft.I skipped getting gas (not a good idea, it turned out) and stopped in to see the parents and admire my sister's new-to-her car.  It was a short visit becauseLaylaThe foster for a dog that was being flown up from Puerto Rico fell through at the last minute.  Who you gonna call?  ME!  Whatever.  I had to drive the hour plus to the airport to pick up the little fluff ball and then drive her home.  She is 10 years old, was an owner-surrender and is a sweet, timid little dog.  She must have felt she landed on Mars.  After being left at a rescue, she was (through voodoo?  I don't know how these rescues are all interconnected) put in a crate, driven to San Juan, put on a plane, then unloaded and put on another plane, then she arrived in upstate NY.  Then she was loaded into my car and driven another hour plus to an alien landscape where, upon alighting from the car, she saw sheep.  She froze in place and I had to carry her in.  We have been observing the usual newcomer protocol - gates up everywhere - and she seems to be fitting in quite nicely.  She is small - just under 20 pounds, blindingly white with floofy bloomers and a short, much-plumed tail, with light tan spots on top of both ears and two round tan dots on her lower back.  She will be adopted in a nanosecond.  We are negotiating our Spanish/English commands and making a little headway.Sunday morning, I was up early - very early, it turned out, as the power had briefly gone off and I hadn't noticed and my clock read 5:30A, causing me to rocket out of bed, thinking I was frittering my morning away!  It was actually 2:30A, but I was wide awake by the time I realized it, so....sigh.I baked a cranberry cake for the barn crew, did some knitting, reassured Layla, did my chores and headed up to my friend, M's farm to put in my first installment of labor-for-vege.  It was the first beautiful morning in what felt like years, and the view from her farm is breath-taking.  We planted asparagus, currants (red and black), gooseberries, did some clean-up around her new fruit trees, and schlepped plants out to the sun to harden off.  All the while, I was yelling (nicely) at her while she clomped around in her ortho-boot with her still-mending broken ankle.  Honestly.  After the two and a half hours, I was back in my car and zipping towards home, where I met my friend and his wife who were due to fix my roof vents!  While Steve worked on the roof, Christina and I helped my neighbor (who had also pulled up - there was an actual work crew!) fix my laundry tree, clear the fence line, and sweep off the top of the barn after clearing the tree falls.  I then worked on my raised beds and front flower bed, until my farmer/neighbor arrived with a truckload of hay.  It was like going from 0-60 without a seatbelt!  I was sure to pop a few ibuprofens before bed.  It just felt too good to be out in the sun to stop.  I figured I would fall into bed and sleep, coma-like, until my usual 4A.  This was the case until midnight, when Layla started crying, pitifully, and didn't stop for an hour.  I gave up, put her on the bed, she rolled into a tight ball and fell asleep.  Thankfully, so did I.  We have moved up the group interaction and all three dogs go out together with no problem.  I don't think she has ever lived with a cat, as Slimmie scares the bejeebers out of her.  This is the first time she will be left for a long stretch -

This is my new lot in life.  Wah, wah, wah.  Blah, blah, blah.Then three things happened that grabbed me by my proverbial lapels and shook me until my pea-sized brain rattled.  First, I received a box from the NW coast containing, among other equally glorious things, a hand-knit cable sweater that I have inherited.  (Said inheritance having been bestowed upon me by my friend, the knitter).  Then, my bestie, Sylvie, drove up from Maine to spend the weekend.  THEN, I received a box from a new friend on the NW coast (mighty nice people up/out there, no?)  that contained enough bright yarn and glittery nail polish to finish off the sparklizing of me!  Why, even the weather cooperated - dropping from slightly lower than normal spring temps with sun (whazat?), back to winter!  With ICE!  And SLEET!  (Can you hear the drip, drip, drip of sarcasm there?)  Seriously, even though I was less than thrilled by the weather - it caused the shortening of my much-needed visiting time with Sylvie - I was able to wear my new sweater!  Woot!Can't wait to see these socks knit up!One of the most fun things about having company - especially Sylvie - is that I get to try out new recipes.  I have been working through my collection of Moosewood cookbooks and decided to make the Cauliflower Cheese Pie from the original Moosewood cookbook, then had planned the Spiced Pineapple Pilaf (from Mollie Katzen's Vegetable Heaven) with a Zatar roasted chicken.  The beauty of the CC pie is that the crust is made from grated potatoes (GF) and I happened to have some spiffy hash brown potatoes that made making the crust a snap.  It was easy and delicious.  Since Sylvie had to leave early Sunday morning, I wasn't sure if I would make the pilaf/chicken dish.  Then the temperatures dropped, I had on my snuggly warm new-to-me cable sweater and thought, what the heck.  In the process of making the rice, I decided to tackle the non-functioning pressure cooking part of my Instant Pot.**Aside here - let me say this about Instant Pot's customer service.  They are very responsive.  And they do absolutely nothing to help you.  In fact, I would guess that their motto is, \"smile and do nothing\".  After getting - and I kid you not - the exact same instructions to 'troubleshoot', over four times, it dawned on me that they had no intention whatsoever to honor their warranty.Through a judicious use of tweezers, I was able to get the pot up to pressure and then promptly over-cooked my rice.  More work needs to be done on my rice-cooking skills.  In any event, the spice mixture was intriguing and delicious and the dish was easy to make.  I had pineapple left over from making my neighbor's birthday cake, so I got to clean out my fridge.  (Insert Happy Dance)  I had defrosted one of my last meat chicken halves and put together a zatar/palm sugar rub and the results were great.This does not reflect the golden-nessof this dish, both spicy and sweet!**Aside #2 - When cooking with me, my sisters ask - gee, do you have any (insert ingredient)?  Then fall all over themselves in laughter, nudge-nudge, wink-wink.  I have at least five pounds of everything.  Ergo, the gallon jar of mustard seeds.  And why?  Just in case I need them in a recipe.  Which usually calls for - at the most - two teaspoons.  Sigh.  However, if you are ever on a deserted island with me, we will have mustard seeds.Seriously?The dogs were completely worn out, vying for Sylvie's attention and slept through most of Sunday.  This left me time to begin to tackle Project Guestroom.  I got half the closet done and probably would have been further along, had I not gotten completely sidetracked by a) knitting, b) all the stuff I had forgotten was in the closet.  In any event, it's started and I have vowed to have the guest room in order, chop-chop.  As a matter of fact, I did promise to get the house in order (relatively speaking - I mean, I am only human and only one human) by the end of October or I would bring Sylvie in to whip me into shape.  I/we also got two pieces of Czech fabric folk art framed.  These have been languishing for...at least 30 years.   **Aside #3 - Every time Sylvie comes to visit, I am filled with an overwhelming desire to purge my junk and read many books.  She should package and sell her skills.  AND she brought me a brandy-new pair of shoes, a small Cuisinart food processor and two bottles of wine and left me with a book list.  No, you cannot have her - she is MINE.Then the wind picked up to gale-force, the house was pelted with ice for hours and it was Monday.  I needed super powers to get going this morning.Jump-started"},

wait for it - we are due to get another 10-18 inches starting tomorrow into Thursday.  Will the fun ever stop?  Let's hope so.PrettyNot prettyDownright uglyThere's a barn behind all that.Broken.Maybe the worst of allHanging on by a threadThere were no branches therepre-stormIt was very ugly.  And very heavy.  I had a great deal of tree and limb damage, which means a great deal of fence damage.  My laundry tree was bent in half.  Worst of all - the entire snow load off the back of the roof came down on the pergola and, had I not had the foresight to tether it to the railing post - it would have been ripped down.  As it is, it will need a lot of repair.  Mea culpa, as I did not have the presence of mind to realize that snow comes off the metal roof like an Alpine avalanche and the pergola was placed too close to the house.  Of course, it didn't help to have an inexperienced builder, either.  It was out of plumb way before the snow load hit it - ergo, the tethering.  Another item on the spring to-do list.It was a long and back-breaking weekend, with much shoveling and re-shoveling.  The only bright spot was that I did not lose power.  A lot of houses around us did.  And for more than two days, too, so I will count my blessing where I find them.Given that I had a lot of time on my hands (when I wasn't shoveling or recovering from shoveling), I finished my socks and started a new pair for March.  I also had some leisurely, healthy breakfasts for a change since mostly I skip breakfast (I know, I know).Before washing and blockingMy fav - although not the most appetizing looking -Avocado/Egg Salad on GF Caraway toast!I also decided to add to the chaos because, well, that is just how I seem to roll.  Meet our new foster project:That face.That...bodyBefore she discovered \"her\" bed.I had been thinking about fostering, as there is such a huge need in our area.  But, not surprisingly, I am both leery and drawn to it in equal measures.  I had been negotiating to foster a spaniel from SC, but she ended up ill and was not transported.  Then I was included in an email chain that contained the words, \"URGENT\" in every paragraph.  Zsa Zsa (who names these dogs?) had been picked up as a stray in a city west of Albany and had reached the critical stage on the animal control list.  She is older, extremely overweight and was so gentle and sweet-natured that the staff kept trying to shuffle her around to extend her stay with them.  But, as it became a matter of hours before she was to be euthanized, the rescue group that I am part of kicked into gear.  She was tested with cats and had many interactions with a Chihuahua, which she ignored.  I still had/have reservations, but I have set up a veritable fortress (there are double barriers - another layer added after the photograph just above).  She has had no direct interaction with my crew and has show little interest - other than barking at Peanut Butter the first day.  She has badly infected ears, needs to lose at least 12 lbs, her gums bleed, her skin is dry, and she was totally exhausted.  She is being treated for a dysfunctional thyroid, although no one bothered to test her - they just medicated her - and needs to have her feet bathed every other day.  She needs to have a bath, too, but there is no way I can get her (she seems to respond to Lulu, so that's what I'm calling her) into my tub.  One of the rescue staff and I are working on getting her to a DIY dog bath place where they have walk-in tubs.  It took all my strength to heft her hinney into my SUV at the vet's.  She has literally spent the past 48 hours sleeping.  Noisily.  Once she discovered her comfy, orthopedic bed, she has been glued to it.  Who knows how long it has been since she's felt safe and hasn't been surrounded by noise.  She's already perked up and looks less bulky.  Could be the meds or could be the quality (and less of a quantity) of food.  She was once someone's pet, as she sits and offers either paw.  She also leans into you and tries her best to roll her rotund body over for tummy scratches.  The latter reminds me of the Titanic.  I am rather smitten.  But she will remain separated for a week and, even then, I will always monitor their interaction.  She is crated while I'm gone and she does not complain.  Once the snow disappears (June?), we will get out and get some exercise.  We are aiming at a weight loss of approx. a pound a week.  This will help all of us, as Lovey was beginning to, once again, resemble a loaf of bread and PB looks like a fat seal pup.  Let's not even discuss their 'mother'.I need to clear the paths again before the worst of the storm hits tomorrow.  If the office closes for the day, I have a chance.  If not?  Well, Farch can't last forever, can it?﻿"},

my morning tastes change from coffee to tea.  And I know that I am not 100% until I can think about a cup of joe without gagging.  As of this morning, I am officially cured.Thanks to the thoroughly bizarre weather, the chicken yard - and all flat or near-flat surfaces - became skating rinks.  Ice and nothing but ice, as far as the eye could see.  Negotiating my way to barn and coop with 5 gallon buckets of water should have made me a contender for the winter Olympics.  I would have scored a gold, no doubt about it.  I have a couple of chickens who have pulled some tendon or other and have been mincing around, poor dears.  The ducks didn't mind the ice one bit, as they sledded on their warm tummies, propelling themselves with their webby feet.  Because of the ice, the pups were limited to bathroom breaks on the deck.  Oh, joy.  Not that this would come as a surprise, but Lovey did her best (with a worried look) to do her business in the far corners.  PB left me little 'presents' right in front of gates and right on my path to the gates.  Now that our weather has decided to rocket into summer (forecast is 72* today), the ice has receded and I am able to let the dogs spread the 'wealth' in the back yard.  I still tote PB down the steps and do not allow Lovey to run, but at least I am not cleaning up the deck every two hours.*****As a total aside, I had allowed myself to be lured into purchasing a snuggly bed for PB for Christmas, as he is a world-class snuggler and manages to roll himself into any fabric at hand.  Not only did it take MONTHS to receive this product, it was way, way smaller than advertised and would be more the perfect size for a grey squirrel.  Countless unanswered emails to the company, followed by the discovery that their phone number had been disconnected, frustrated any attempt to return it.  They have gotten terrible reviews and I am not sure if they are nothing but scammers or a small company that got deluged over the holidays and were totally unable to handle it.  Nevertheless, if you see an ad from Paw Prime, run the other way!This was the size to fit up to 20#.Not.*****I'm back.  Miss me?  :)  By Friday, I was still slogging around, but had gotten more energy and focus back.  So I hurled myself into the yarn stash.  Holey Moley.  Four hours later, I had managed to just get through about 2/3rds of it.  With images of yarn long forgotten dancing in front of my eyes, I decided to do a rough sorting by weight, to be fine-tuned at a later date, when I was not in danger of relapsing.  I culled out two large shopping bags of old circular needles, some patterns I will never knit, and tons of partial, full and bitty balls of yarn.  They are being donated to a woman who does charity knitting - if she ever makes it over to get them.  My biggest gripe about freecycle or any attempt at giving things away for free.  I then sat down and wound some yarn into balls.  It's official.  I have enough fingering weight yarn to knit 27 pairs of socks.Sorry for the dark photo - ballwinder is in the foreground,swift in the back.These socks will glow in the dark! Bonus yarn - for every skeinsold, a tree will be planted in Africa!By Sunday I was feeling almost 100%, having managed to break my chronic insomnia!  I drove to a trendy and picturesque town about 40 minutes south of me, to meet one of my besties for breakfast.  We managed to get there early enough to beat the horde of weekenders who manage to suck all the beauty out of the place, Thursday-Sunday.  After breakfast and a thoroughly wonderful catch-up session, I found myself inexplicably drawn into the local yarn shop.  I needed an intervention!  I did, actually, pretty much behave myself.  But I am a victim of lovely yarn - just as I am a victim of lovely books in a bookshop.  And lovely cookware in a cookware shop.  I went in with a list and stuck to it.   (Pardon me while I dislocate my shoulder, patting myself on the back...)  My cousin - who has mysteriously vowed to make everyone in my family a handmade quilt - nicely accepted the offer of two pair of hand knit socks as a thank you.  The problem is, she is very conservative and wears only navy, grey, dark brown, and *gasp* sage green.  Why is this a problem?  100% of the sock yarn in my weighty stash is represented by the yarn you see above.  I mean, really?  If you are going to spend hours laboring over a garment, why not make sure it stands out?  Nay, shouts out its presence in a loud, clear tone!  I did manage to find some nice grey, marled yarn and that is about as conservative as I can force myself to be.Monday, being a holiday, allowed me to work myself into a complete lather over the prospect of having to capture and contain Slimmie for his vet appointment.  He has not been to the vet since the vertigo incident, a couple of years ago.I had made the appointment for late afternoon, thinking that it is the time for his fifth or sixth nap in his self-warming bed.  My plan?  Creep on him - all nonchalantly - spring on him, towel at the ready, and quickly wrap him like a burrito and stuff him in his crate before he knew what was happening.  Things didn't quite work out as planned - he refused to take his late afternoon nap and I had to lure him onto the kitchen island with a pile 'o treats, THEN I  rolled him quickly in a towel and stuffed him unceremoniously into his crate.  There was much screeching and howling.  There was continual screeching and howling - for the 45 minute drive to the vet and the 45 minute drive home.  He was quiet as a mouse during the visit.  My ears are still ringing.  I was very happy that he didn't need extensive dental work - my vet, bless his heart, is very hands-on and flicked the tartar off.  He does not believe in unnecessary surgery or any other treatments requiring anesthesia.  We discussed Lovey's torn ACL and I got out of there for under $150!  I had a nice hot cup of tea when we got home to quiet my nerves, and was treated to the cold feline shoulder for about 10 minutes.  I think we were both thrilled it was over.  (Black cats are so hard to photograph!)The cold shoulderThe warm shoulderNow I am back to work, shoveling my way through hundreds of emails and piles of paper.  But I have something to brighten my workday - thanks to the very-talented Kristina of Pioneer Woman at Heart.  I had seen these cup mats on her blog and HAD to have one (or four)!  They were even more beautiful in person!  Even my coffee tastes better!So pretty!And beautifully crafted!!Now I have to go and catch up on all the wonderful blog posts I've missed.  Perfect lunchtime reading!﻿﻿﻿﻿"},
{"title": "That thing I can't talk about.", "date": "Monday, February 12, 2018", "text": "I have never been good at keeping secrets - unless someone confides in me and then you could not rip it from my lips.  (Yeesh.  That sounds a little brutal, but you catch my drift, right?)  I have a memory of one of my non-finer moments as a child when, not only did I let the cat out of the bag on my youngest sister's Christmas present, but I led her to its hiding place.  I was such an awful child.  Good thing I did not perpetuate those personality traits.So it is with profound angst that I find myself dying to tell you about what I just completed, but I dasn't.  It is a gift and it is on it's slow-boat way across the Atlantic.  I am hoping, actually, that it is jetting its way...  What I can say (but probably shouldn't - let's face it, it's too late to change the stripes on this zebra) is that I finished it last weekend, then had to wait impatiently for certain blocking elements - blocking?  Who knew? - before I could stretch it into its perfect shape, let it dry and get it in the post.If you're not already bored to weeping, I will elucidate on the intricacies of blocking.  Because I am now an expert.  Just ask me.  Once a garment or knitted item is finished, it is recommended that you get it wet, squeeze it ever-so-gently damp (NO WRINGING) and block it into the shape it should be on a flat surface.  This, apparently, allows all the nubbly bits and awkward stitches to relax and become sublime.  For my first blocking attempt, I chose a challenging project.  It involved things like 'blocking wires' and 'blocking pins' and 'blocking pin thingys'.  An aside here, the days of Home-Ec knitting is long gone.  We are now in the age of designer, hand-dyed, speckled, sprinkled, special yarn; all tonal and stuff.  With a price tag to match.  Every single piece of equipment necessary to help you along on this fine craft is expensive.  You no longer are expected to use knees, chair backs, chair arms, or the arms of a patient spouse to wind your skeins into balls.  You need swifts and winders, niddy-noddies and god-knows-what else.  I digress.Because I am *cough* cheap as all get-out, I refused to pay some outrageous amount of money for blocking wires.  Instead, I found a great deal on a 25' length of stainless steel wire and pounced on it.  I am sure you can imagine what happened when I unpackaged it.  It shot out of its package like a cougar, pouncing on its prey.  It took me no less than a half hour to wrestle it into submission and cut it into manageable lengths.  Then there was the matter of finding a very large empty floor space that was not prone to paw traffic.  Then there were the blocking mats.  It goes on and on.  Suffice to say, a job that should have taken me 20 minutes, tops, took hours.  But, through force of will, much brute force and a sailor's salty vocabulary uttered at the top of my lungs, the job was done.  Once I get the news that it has arrived, I will unveil the end product.  It was totally worth it, if I do say so myself.Instead, I give you the February socks:Can there be more going on, pattern-wise in this photo?I have about one-third of the second sock done and, not content with focusing on one thing, I have a second pair on the needles, too.  That is not, of course, all I did this weekend.  I came home Friday to find the entrance to the carport blocked by a giant box.  While I commend FedEx for making sure the box was out of the weather, he had plunked it in the middle of a large puddle.  Sigh.  Luckily, the contents were enveloped in a large plastic bag.Inside?  Lovey's new bed.  Or, Bed Number Five, as we like to call it.  Her Bed Number Four was not really to her liking, it being just a tiny bit small.  It didn't matter anyway, as PB takes full possession of all objects, dog-related or not, immediately upon their arrival.  I was hoping the new bed would induce her to lie on it, in lieu of the sofa, which entails her springing up, off of her injured knee.  I shouldn't have been worried.  It is as large as a kiddie pool and takes up a quarter of our living space.  After tripping over it for a day, I turned the flat edge toward the wall just to reduce it's profile.  Bingo!  Unwittingly, I had created a nest and Lovey moved in.Nest with a view and cozyblanket enhancementsThis has not bothered PB, as he has commandeered the entire sofa.  Which has opened up the slot next to me each morning for Slimmie.  Everyone is blissfully happy.  It also dawned on me that the reason the living room is disassembled every night when I come home, is that Lovey is so very insecure being left to guard hearth and home by herself.  I can't let PB out of his crate when I'm not home because he will whirl himself into parapalegicality (word?)  So she is left to deal with all the scary things by herself - random cars up the drive, UPS and FedEx drivers, meter reader, Angus bull.  I have decided to leave the curtains drawn to filter out some of the fear-triggers.  Poor nervous Nellie.I dug out two oldies-but-goodies recipes over the weekend (no photos, sorry) and a new one - Reuben Quiche.  I made Blueberry Gingerbread for the barn crew (and a neighbor and a pile for the office), and tackled a Ballantined chicken.  At least that's what I call it.  You bone the chicken in one piece, then put a stuffing of your choice in, roll it up, tie it and roast it.  It's the perfect way to get the most out of your roasted chicken, but it's not a process for the faint-hearted.  I like to think of it as my 'show-off skill'.  Many, many years ago, I went to a cooking school to learn how to do it.  It's very fancy...  I stuffed it this time with homemade ricotta cheese, parmesan cheese and spinach sautéed briefly with garlic and shallots, but I usually stuff it with chicken mousse, ham and pistachios.  It was fabulous!  I had my friend, Marianne, over for dinner.  She, in turn, brought me another gorgeous area rug, a lovely Christmas plate and a beautiful holiday wreath she had made herself.  She is so talented!!!  I will have to post a photograph of it.All in all, with the exception of the weather, it was a very pleasant weekend."},

{"title": "Just when it couldn't have been more surreal...", "date": "Thursday, January 18, 2018", "text": "Tuesday night was a nightmare - driving-wise.  The snow started at about 4 P in the city and was blinding by the time I hit the road home.  It was a fine, icy snow, too, just to add more spice to the experience.  Having grown up on the southern shores of Lake Erie, I am plenty accustomed to driving in snow.  I learned to drive with a manual transmission and have never looked back.  This, along with a very strong sense of survival, has served me well as I continue to live Norther.I wish I could say the same for the nimrods on the road with me that night.  As I headed up my mountain road, I came upon three cars in various stages of off-the-road.  I very, very carefully turned around and headed home by the long route.  During the slow, hair-raising trip home, three cars went off the road in front of me (all were fine and had cell phones) and the super-duper-nimrod tailgating me went off the road himself.  Thankfully, without taking me with him.  I did not bother to check on his ability to call for help, feeling that one call from the group would suffice.I skipped kissing the snowy ground when I got home (although I did hug my mail - my special yarn arrived!) and got the dogs out ASAP.  It had taken me almost two hours to make the one hour trip.  I then geared up to do evening chores and, when on the deck headed toward the gate to the sheep area, I saw an odd sight.  The chicken coop was lit from within - it had been so dark in the morning, I turned their light on - and silhouetted on the OUTSIDE of the coop, under five inches of snow, were the chickens.  Holey Shineola.I trudged my way to the coop, wielding my snow shovel, and found most of the hens with Mr. Cowardpants huddled in a cold, damp clump.  I very carefully opened the door and looked in.  To go eye-to-beady-eye with a hawk, sitting on the roost, nice as you please.  HOLEY SHINEOLA.  I did a quick glance around and saw one dead hen, with a few more cowering in nesting boxes and wadded into the corners.  This was not going to be easy.  Fast-forward through much flinging, flinching, wielding, screeching, and other hysteria (and that was just me), the hawk ended up flying violently into the wall and knocking itself out.  I swear it was like a scene from an Alfred Hitchcock movie.  I carefully removed the hawk and the poor remains of one of my dear Faverolles outside and then started to gently herd the flock into the coop.  I did a quick head count and realized three were missing.  After getting everyone settled down, I went out in the dark with my headlamp and managed to find two, hunkered under the little coop.  I did not find the third.  Everyone was securely closed in and I moved the hawk into a sheltered place and left it to its own devices.I finished chores, fed the dogs and had a glass of my neighbor's 200 proof eggnog for dinner.In the morning, under a foot of beautiful new snow (they forecast 4-6 inches - max.)  I discovered a bedraggled, damp, cold hen aimlessly pushing through snow drifts.  Poor dear.  I got my hands on her and slipped her into the warm coop.  I am sad to say the hawk did not survive - they are beautiful birds, but I could not leave it in the coop, obviously, and it would not fly out into the dark.  Never a dull moment."},
{"title": "Gee, that was fun.", "date": "Tuesday, January 16, 2018", "text": "It was an exciting weekend - we went from 60 to -18.  It snowed, sleeted and poured rain.  There were ice jams, flooding, power outages, wind.  Then everything froze solid.  I guess this is the new 'normal'.  Mercy.There was also some upheaval in the LLF household.  After years of enduring a sturdy, but eroding, hand-me-down sofa, we got a new-to-us sofa and a new-to-us rug!  My life, it seems, is all about timing.  I had to coordinate the delivery of the new sofa and rug with the removal of the old sofa.  Since nothing is ever seamless, the new sofa/rug arrived on Thursday afternoon and were stored in the carport - on a tarp, up on blocks due to the entire day of torrential rain on Friday - until my farmer neighbor could get over with his farm hand on the weekend to move the old one out.  It was a queen-sized sleeper and weighed a ton.  As luck (hahahaha) would have it, as soon as the rain stopped, the temperatures took a header and I went out to find my car sealed in a shell of ice on Saturday morning.  Four kettles of hot water later, I had freed the driver's side door and ran it until I could chip the ice off the windows and go feed the farm cats.The actual switcheroo was very fast and I then (wo)man-handled the new rug - which is quite a bit larger than the old one - and the sofa into place.  We are waiting for the rug to calm down.  The new sofa is larger than the old one and a bit higher, but very comfortable and in great condition.Lovey waiting for permission to give it a test nap.Approved!You will notice the weiner ramp on the left.  Lovey does not approve of the ramp.  The colors are perfect and I was able to move the old living room rug to the dining area.  I can't believe how much difference this new set up makes - it is tres cosy and gives a lot more area of traction to the dogs - very necessary, as both have leg/spine issues.  I sent off the extra-long hallway rug to be cleaned and that will complete the coverage.I finished my socks and, alas, they are too big.  I had realized it after the first was finished, but I am not accomplished enough to adjust a pattern to different sizes.  This was a one-off size.  I didn't remember to take a picture of the blocked socks, but  will, as they, more than likely, are going to be the stars of a giveaway...  One down, eleven pairs to go!  I then realized that I didn't have another project ready for the needles.  This is code for \"I have no idea where all the yarn is for the hundreds of projects that are languishing in craft room\".  I found my ball winder and swift and wound 8 skeins of yarn.  Since I still have a couple weeks to go before the February socks can start, I cast on some beautiful silk/wool blend yarn for a small cowl project.  This weekend - amidst the vet appointment, adoption clinic and 'date' with my sister - I will begin the Great Craft Room Revival.  Prayers are now being accepted...Here's the \"After\" photo of the Cat/Canning Room Clean-up:If you look closely, you can just see the top of Slimmie in his self-warming bed.  He LOVES it.  The other beds and cushions are for when he has friends for sleep-overs.  Not.*****Just on the off-chance that there might be interest, let me know if you are interested in either of these:Lots of great patterns in this magazine!This baby is a TOME!﻿I will mail them to the first person who claims them.   Once again, US only - however, the sock giveaway will be open to all!"},

I got chauffeured around.We saw the ocean.One of my favorite SoPo parks.Their new guest quarters that are socompletely cozy and comfortable.It shows what a good friend Sylvie is, when someone horns in on a family dinner, then spends most of the time sleeping.  Not only did she take me in and feed me well, but she clothed me, too!  I didn't have to raid my favorite Goodwill in South Portland because she handed on to me such a splendid array of garments that I am set for the year!  She is a peach.  She also inspires me to bring order to my life, so I also came home with some ideas on how to whip myself (and house) into shape.I almost didn't mind that Monday came so fast...almost.Someone was very happy I washome."},

Oh, mother.It was a very frigid weekend (ergo, the hoodie sweatshirt - I didn't do it because I was THAT kind of a dog mom.  Really.  Honest.) so my time outside was fairly limited.  Instead, I focused on the Unlist and hand-washed 9 pairs of socks, vacuumed, swept, straightened, cleaned bathrooms, made soup (I'm working my way through my Moosewood cookbooks), made chili and cornbread, baked a big pan of brown rice, and made more headway on clearing out the UCG (unknown canned goods) that are cluttering my canning shelves.  I also forced myself to go to the Laundromat.  I think my sense of dread comes from all those years of living in apartments and, consequently, all those mind-numbing hours sat in dreary, linoleum-floored rooms, watching my laundry go round and round.  It makes me feel like Ratso Rizzo.  However, my washer cannot handle a load of area rugs and the sofa covers.  So, off I went.  It was a great way to get some quiet knitting time in - there were only a handful of fellows (who, I noticed, crammed six loads of dirty laundry into the cheapest/smallest washer they found.  No sorting of darks and lights to be seen.)  I distributed my laundered rugs over the deck railing when I got home, as I am too cheap to ante up the cash for their dryers.  Plus, I can only stand being there through a wash cycle.Quiet timeI did feel very virtuous, though.  Lots more things mentally ticked off the Unlist.  Peanut Butter goes to his third vet this afternoon for evaluation as to whether he is a candidate for laser treatments on his back.  I am putting on my Pollyanna glasses for this - he has come quite a way with just confinement and he is young.  I am for anything that will hasten his recovery.  The only appointment this vet had available was at 1 o'clock.  It is in the city, so there was no way I was going to drive in (1 hour), then drive home (ditto), then drive back to the city (ditto2), then drive home, you get the drift.  Feeling like the mother of an infant, I picked up a booster seat for the car and a portable kennel for the office.  I really don't know how women can manage all that paraphernalia - and carry their baby.  I got as far as the office garage (after making four trips from house to car at the get-go) and was stumped.  Luckily, the building super appeared and saved our bacon - he schlepped the kennel upstairs and pushed all the buttons and opened the doors (also turning on the lights).  Then he made a second trip down to retrieve the blankie and leash that I forgot.  Portable Stir.I'm hoping the treatments do their job.  I'm too old for motherhood."},
{"title": "How to put the challenge into your day.", "date": "Wednesday, November 8, 2017", "text": "Tuesday morning started out with everything going for it.Good book, a variety of knitting,pumpkin spice coffee.  Heaven.When I schlepped the goober outside for his early morning constitutional, I noticed - to my horror - that his back end was having trouble maneuvering.  As soon as the clock struck 8, I put a call in to my vet and they squeezed us in at 10.  This produced a flurry of emails with my office nobs (one of whom dislikes dogs) wherein I stated confidently that I would be in directly, following the dropping off at home of PB.Oh, ha.What a pair we are, waitingfor the neurologist and a coupleof ibuprofensThe vet took one look at PB and declared \"you need a neurologist!\"  I scooped him up and trotted out in the direction of my car.  Before I reached it, I managed to trip over an uneven patch and had gone headlong - hanging onto PB for dear life until just before impact, when I sort of slid him forward.  I did manage not to injure him further, but my right knee received the brunt of the impact.  As did my best pair of jeans, dammit.  I gimped him to the car and then gimped back into the vet's office to pay.  They took one look at my knee, sat me down and started to work.  If you're going to take a header, it's better to do it in proximity of people with medical knowledge.  We joked about how vet wrap is to vets what duct tape is to farmers.﻿After taking off the sticky wrap that was to make sure the vet wrapdidn't slip.  She is nothing if notthoroughWith my knee firmly bandaged, I hobbled back to the car and we headed an hour west to a veterinary specialist.  By the time we pulled into the emergency entrance, the shock had worn off and my knee was throbbing.  And I was getting the little brown stink eye from PB.  Long and painful story short, he was diagnosed with invertebral disc disease and I received an ice pack and two ibuprofens.  And a sizeable bill.  I was happy they didn't charge me for the ice pack or meds.  My only two options, according to them, was to keep PB in strict confinement, on pain meds, for four weeks OR get an MRI done with surgery to follow.  Hmmm.  $168 or $7000+?  Let me think about it - for a nanosecond.  They felt we had caught the problem quickly enough that there was a pretty good chance (65%) that the confinement would work.  By the time we got out of there (after a blow by blow stream of emails to the office, whether they gave a damn or not), we didn't arrive home until 3 o'clock.  We were both exhausted.  I gave PB his pain meds (liquid - citrus flavored.  Why? Why not liver?) which he hates, swaddled him in six fleece blankets and put him in his crate.  I was about to self-medicate, since it was 5 o'clock somewhere, but remembered I had to vote.  This is a small town.  Had I sashayed into the polling place, the Election Ladies would have had their antennae going and the fact that they detected Sauvignon Blanc at 3:30 would have raced through the town like wildfire.I voted, did my chores and fixed an extra-special doggie dinner.  Then I fixed an extra-special Doggie Mommie dinner that only required one glass.  Sleeping was a little rough, as I kept turning over the fact that I chose the cheaper way out than what may be better for the little guy.  By 2 o'clock, I gave up and got up.  I had pretty much decided that I would find a way to pay for it.  I was not going to have PB end up paralyzed.  He did seem a little, tiny bit more steady this morning, so that gave me a boost.  Then, as I rehashed the day with our office building super (he and his wife have 7 dogs and are super-rescuers), he mentioned laser treatments.  Apparently, there is a third option that has proven highly successful in the treatment of IDD.  At a fraction of the cost, with no meds.  I will be consulting with a third vet tomorrow.  Geezlouise."},

{"title": "October goes out like a dragon.", "date": "Tuesday, October 31, 2017", "text": "My life seems to be ruled by Murphy's Law.  I finally got an entire weekend on my own - no obligations whatsoever! - and I lost half of it to Mother Nature.  Ah, well.  I put some hustle in my bustle Saturday morning and fairly burst out the door at sunrise.  Since I had cleaned the coop and duck chalet the previous Sunday, I focused on the sheep.  The unfortunate thing about my sheep (and also the endearing thing) is that they are very, very helpful.  No matter what I am doing, they are there to snoopervise.  Especially Linden, whose soft, lanolin-y head is always in my business.   A large pumpkin was cut into fourths and put at a safe distance from me.  This always works - for about 15 minutes.  You have to work fast!First on the list was to reinforce the hay racks in the barn for winter feeding.  I had finally Gerry-rigged them onto the pallet fence that (barely) separates them from the hay, using twelve pieces of baling twine.  I cut them down and screwed them to boards, top and bottom, using large washers so they couldn't man/sheep handle the feeders off the screws.  Then I screwed the boards to the fence, using 3\" screws.  One poor rack had had bits of it broken off, so that called for some additional ingenuity - I wired the loop-less ends to the boards, then screwed over the wires so that they couldn't rub them off.  Honestly, sheep.I also walked the perimeter of the fencing and discovered that I will have to replace almost half of it next year.  Early on, in my homesteading adventure, I had a lovely llama who had the very bad habit of leaning heavily on the fence, in order to reach the greenery on the other side.  This was exacerbated by Linden, my sheep-goat, who took advantage of every weakness and wormed his way under various part of the fence.  Luckily, he is too old and fat to do that now, but the damage has been done.  I've patched the worst places, as we have a lot of coyotes and I do not want them getting under the fence, but it really needs to be replaced.  When I delivered the Sunday morning barn baked goods, I talked to the high school kid that helps with the cows and he is interested in doing the heavy lifting.I then spent the rest of the day battening down the hatches.  There had been high wind and flooding warnings for days before, so I made sure that all small objects were safely closed away.  I took down my wind chimes and my mirror chain.  I brought in the fig tree and stacked buckets in the barn.  I also tied the pergola to the deck rail.  It has a definite list to port.  I believe I will be calling the \"architect\" back for a look-see in the spring.Sunday started with misty-type rain and I headed west of the city, early, to do some errands I have been putting off for months.  I made it back just before the heavy rain to hit - let me just say that ALL dachshunds seem to hate rain - and squeezed in a potty break, then we hunkered down to wait it out.  It was quite a storm.  The wind was howling all night, with waves of rain bashing the house, which didn't do much for my insomnia.  There is nothing like hearing a BAM and then BAM-BAM, and running through all the things that could cause it - trees coming down on your car.  Trees coming down on the car port.  I gave up trying to ignore it at 3 and then managed to get a cup off coffee on before the power went off.  It came on an hour later, then went off again.  Then came on.  After the third time, I gave up resetting the clocks and pulled out my inflatable solar lights and started knitting.Once the wind died down to a low roar, I stuck my head out and checked the car and carport - both okay!  After that, I cleaned the guest bathroom (I had watched an episode of OCD extreme cleaning and got a shot of inspiration!), fed the dogs and took the day off from work.  I suited up and, other than some major tree branches down and a couple of small trees and a truckload of leaves, there was no damage to the buildings.  The fence was another ball of wax.  At least the worst damage was to an area that the sheep are not in.  My dairy farmer neighbor stopped by to discuss my cows and he happened to have his chainsaw in the truck.  Ten minutes later, the tree was off the fence and I had stacked it in a nice, neat pile.  I believe that a chain saw will be going on my list to Santa."},

{"title": "click, click, click.......chirrup, chirrup, chirrup.....scratch, scratch, scratch.....", "date": "Wednesday, September 27, 2017", "text": "So goes the unending soundtrack to the progression of sleepless nights, as I segue into what should be autumn.  It always takes me a month or two for me to get in sync with the short days and long nights and it's worse this year with the uber-warm temperatures both day and night.  I am also a very light sleeper, which is not helpful.  I am usually nodding off by 8:30, unless I can force myself up and into action after evening chores.  That rarely happens.  I am out like a light by 9, then, around 2A, my conscious brain (there is so little of it left...) starts to hear the click of cat nails, the chorus of crickets outside the bedroom window and the unknown things that are gnawing, scratching and making unpleasant little noises.  Since Mr. P Butter's entrance into the homestead, Slimbo Kitten has been a little down in the dumps.  There is some easing of tensions, as MPB is less likely to bolt after him now that he recognizes him as part of the family, but Slimbo still stays in his room most of the time.  This is hard on him (and me) because he was my cuddlesnugums after Pepperoni died.  His place is now filled by the interloper.  Since I wasn't sleeping anyway, I have taken to leaving my bedroom door open and Slimbo now tippy-taps his way in as soon as MPB is safely crated and lights are out, purring madly, and jumps up on the bed, finds a comfy position, and is down for the night.  He is much happier.My rule of thumb is, if I am not able to coerce myself back to sleep within a half-hour of waking up, I get up.  This eliminates the chance of the endless loop of unhelpful thoughts that pop up and won't go away.  An upside of this is that I have completed one pair of socks for my sister, and I am well into the second pair.  The downside is that I have to make sure I am not nodding off on my way home at night.  This usually entails downing a large latte at some point during the afternoon, which, perversely, keeps me awake at night.  It's a vicious circle."},
{"title": "I'm All Baked Out.", "date": "Monday, September 25, 2017", "text": "Another whirlwind weekend.  Since there was lots going on and the temperatures were going to be in the upper 80s to low 90s with accompanying humidity, I decided that I should spend most of the weekend in front of a hot oven.  I really can't help myself.  It started Friday night, when I finally got to try a new pizza crust recipe using zucchini.  I had seen this on a blog that I admire and saved it for trying some hot, sultry evening.Zucchini & cheese - what's not to love?Phase 2 - the PrebakeI couldn't wait...I was such a rousing success, that I toyed with the option of having nothing but zucchini pizza crusts for the next week - never mind the toppings!  This is a complete winner and I will be making more of these and freezing them - as long as the zucchini (Marianne's, not mine) holds out.Then there was the anniversary dinner for my parents.  I whipped up a GF pineapple upside down cake Saturday morning.  This is a solid standard for me - it has never let me down.  No one even guessed it was GF.  It also helped ease the pain of my mechanic's bill...almost.It came out of the pan in perfect condition!In between, there were two batches of my new favorite granola/muesli - cherry and pecan.  Although the second batch was cherry, walnut and almond.  I had run out of pecans.  The first batch went to my neighbor and my sister.  The second is all mine.  You can find the recipe here.  I really like it because it is not too sweet, using maple syrup instead of sugar.Half of batch #1I had invited Marianne over for dinner on Sunday because it was a great way to get to spend some quality time with her.  She brought about 10# of tomatoes, more zucchini (!!!!!!), a cucumber, apples, and a bottle of wine.  Good grief.  She also schlepped her apple picker because I had two pears out of reach on my good old pear tree.  It was a great evening, topped off with:Prune Plum Crumble!I was too distracted to take a picture pre-dinner.  I am saving the pips because those plums are soooo delicious, I am hoping to start my own trees.  You will see two and a half pints of diced tomatoes next to it - I am managing a couple, few pints of things here and there.  I do not have a great deal of tomatoes (although Marianne is trying...) for canning up a big batch, so doing a couple at a time has worked out great.  I have what amounts to a stainless steel asparagus cooker that I use as a tiny batch hot water canner.  Bonus!The best part of the weekend?  Celebrating the Official Foster Failure of Peanut Butter!  He is ours, officially.  He and Lovey (and Slimbo) had tiny hamburger patties cooked on the grill to celebrate.Guarding his strawberryOn a humorous note, as part of the anniversary celebration, my mother requested that we convene on their den and look at family slides.  Slides, for those young whippersnappers, were the iPhone pics of the 60s and 70s.  There was much riotous laughter.  I leave you with evidence of my moody teenage self.I was very big on bangs.  Andfashionable sunglasses.  But I madethe shorts... :)"},
{"title": "Musettes", "date": "Wednesday, September 20, 2017", "text": "Musettes (noun:  very small musings due to non-focus of gray matter or limited time...)Isn't it interesting how your eyes can play tricks on you?  I came home from work and was getting changed for barn chores while I looked out the bedroom window and into the poultry yard.  I froze.  Was that a dead bird that the chickens were pecking away at?!?  OMG!  I raced out the door, shot across the deck and down the stairs to find....the remains of a particularly large red cabbage that my neighbor had tossed in for the hens.  This reminded me of being a freshman in college in Michigan, slogging through the snow in December towards class.  I was a typical over-sensitive, over-wrought artistic type who had gotten as far away from home as my grades and my budget would allow.  I was an art and English major, writing poetry and drawing well into the night.  Very over-dramatic.  As I slogged along, I spotted a dead rabbit in the snow near a stream bank.  Weeping copious tears, I staggered towards the wee dead thing, to see if there was anything I could do.  It was a brown paper bag. *****﻿I dream of the day when there is a way to deliver a virtual slap to a head.  I want to apply it to all the nimrods who meander along the road in front of you and turn - finally - only putting their turn indicator on when they are almost finished with the turn.  WHY BOTHER!*****﻿As I was standing in the laundry room, waiting to remember why I was there, I wondered what the soundtrack to my typical day would be.  I could imagine the Cha-Cha; especially if you could do the steps like so:  one step forward, three steps back - cha, cha, cha!*****When someone wishes me \"A Good One\" - what does it mean?  A good day?  A good life?  A good session with my shrink?  An excellent cup of coffee?  A good stretch?  What?  I know it shouldn't drive me mad, but - let's be honest here - I am listing toward cranky old lady and it just seems to me to be another example of lazy talk.  I even prefer \"Have a Nice Day!\"  At least that has a tad more focus.  Pretty soon it will be \"Have A Nice\".  Then \"Have\".  Then we will be down to grunts.  *****﻿There seems to be a preponderance of dead skunks on, by, near the road over this past week.  I have a healthy respect for them (as should everyone....) and they do occupy a rather soft spot in my heart.  Way back - as in WAAAAY back - I had a pet skunk.  These were the days when I was an apartment dweller and no dogs were allowed.  Or cats, in most places.  But nowhere to be found in the multi-paged leases was reference to skunks.  Or hermit crabs.  Or button quail.  All of which were under my care for a time.  Not at the same time, of course.  \"Pooh\" was a cuddly little fellow who went on walks with me in his harness and leash ensemble.  There was always a faint whiff of Eau-de-Poo around him, but he had been de-scented.  I was forever haunting pet stores and trying to save whatever I could.  It's been a lifelong goal.  Anyhoo, Pooh and I were quite the team, walking down our neighborhood sidewalks.  The only drawback was that, when he got excited or nervous (which was any time there was another person or living thing besides me in range) he would bite me.  While I wanted to give him exercise and fresh air as often as possible, we were limited to very early mornings or evenings, out of self-defense.  I finally had had enough of serving as a pin cushion and went through a lengthy process of finding him a new home.  Which I did, I am happy to say, and he lived a good, long and happy life with a friend in the sticks.*****﻿Hermit crabs were not the ideal companion for me, as I crave a more cuddly nature.  The only time they provided much excitement was when they 'moved house'.  I would keep my eye on them and watch for any sign that they had outgrown their present motorhome.  Then I would put in an assortment of larger shells and watch.  It was fascinating, watching them line up, straddle the new digs with both claws, then hoist their odd, shriveled hineys into the new shell to try it on.  But, in the end, it wasn't enough to form a lasting bond.*****A note to the no-show winners of the cookbook and chicken saddles - If I am not contacted by the end of Friday, I will re-draw (or, in the case of the saddles - reshelve) a new winner."},

{"title": "Peanut Butter - Hold the Jelly.", "date": "Monday, September 11, 2017", "text": "The one good thing about being wide awake at 3AM, is that you can take advantage of an alert mind (more or less, leaning heavily on the less) to plan out your day to its utmost usefulness.  Then, once you are awake and up and functioning, you can watch it all crumble into dust.Since I am now in my seasonal up-real-early-for-no-apparent-reason state, I do some of my best thinking before I venture out of bed.  Lovey is very relieved to know that she does NOT have to get up, too, and burrows blissfully under her fleece blanket for another two hours.  I, meantime, have a giant cup of coffee, check my email - just in case something really important has happened in the wee, dark hours - and knit.  I like my morning routine, especially on the weekends.Saturday morning, after plotting out my day from sun-up to sun-set, I made my coffee and tottered to my chair, where I wedged in besides Slimbo and opened my email.  It was then that my plans disappeared into the ether.  I had been sending out feelers to volunteer as a foster home for any dogs that met our criteria (older, male - preferably, although we may be open on that item - non-aggressive, good with cats and all things living).  With such a huge influx of dogs and cats coming into our area from Houston and Florida, we wanted to help.  Due to the limits of both space and layout, my house cannot safely quarantine a dog, so mostly, we were not suitable.  Then, this.  Meet Peanut Butter.I see impending foster failure, don't you?What?!  What kind of name is that?  Send it back!PB, also know as Nutter Butter, Bullet, and Whiz, was in foster because of a neglect case north of me.  His owner had been keeping him and his dog brother - a border collie - confined in crates ALL THE TIME, and they were seized, both covered in urine and feces, PB with skin infections, most of his hair gone.  He is through all of his medications and most of his hair is back, although his ears are a little bald.  He is three and suffers from insecurity - and is one of the cuddliest dogs I've ever known.  The rescue needed a new foster because the family who had him wanted to take on more dogs - large house, good set-up for quarantine and very loving people.  The rescue wanted to know if I was interested.  Well, yes, I was.  Lovey and I dumped all other plans and headed towards the city to meet him.  It went well, so the three of us and PB's giant bag of possessions were headed home.  The first three hours were filled with a mostly-haired, reddish brown ricochet ball, zooming around the house, careening off the furniture.  I got them outside in the fenced area and Lovey discovered - to her pleasure - that he was playful!  They never looked back.  Slimbo is withholding approval until PB stops barking at him.  Later that afternoon, I was able to get things done because...Foster brothers are exhausting.I better still be in Heaven when I wake up - with my bone.While they were sleeping, I snuck off to Marianne's to deliver her weekly eggs and get my swag in return.Zucchini, cukes, mushrooms, tomatoes,kohlrabi and apples (not pictured)They don't call it an Oxheart tomatofor nothing!I then came home and made a new vege casserole, which I will definitely make again - sorry, no photos.  Foster brothers ARE exhausting!Sunday was cleaning and I decided to tackle two crafty-type things that I have been skirting for months - decorating a little footstool and framing these:Way back, long, long (looooooong) ago, when I was little, my Uncle Jimmy was in the Army, in South Korea.  When he came back, he brought three little Korean outfits for his three little nieces.  Believe it or not, I still have mine.  I had always wanted to mount and display the outfit - shoes and all - in a box frame.  This never happened, as I would have to have it custom-made and it would cost a fortune.  But I did find a small box frame and intended to at least frame the shoes.  They sort of look like something you'd find in an ancient tomb don't they?  Unfortunately, the frame is not deep enough and I don't want to apply pressure to the shoes, as they will disintegrate.  I am on to Plan B, whatever that may be.  Also, frustratingly, my intention of completing my little step-stool project was also flummoxed when I could not find my paint pen!  Curses.  Not to worry, I have at least seven other projects in the works...*****Giveaway results:Claire's Corner - KYMBER!Chicken Saddles - KAY SAYLOR!Raw Energy - AMBER RAVIS!Thank you, all those who entered.  Winners please email your mailing info to swomersley at gmail dot com."},

even if a third of it gets rained out.  In my never-ending quest to get some big things checked off The List, I have now resorted to blocking areas by the days available.  Ergo:  Saturday = garden, cooking.  Sunday = housecleaning, cooking, preserving.  Monday = last of the house-washing, refencing rhubarb, unfencing duck yard.  Yeehah!  That was the plan - in theory.  In reality?  Actually, I was pretty close!Saturday garden work was put aside because I got fixated on the fencing.  Focus like a fruit-fly, I tell you.Before fence removal and invasionof the flock(s)Old, rusty, cobbled-together fencingdown - invasion in full swing.Invasion aftermath with new fencingand a gate in place.As an aside here, you will notice the complete lack of grass in the poultry yard.  This has never happened before but - in the early spring, as the little blades started poking up, above the dirt, we got about two weeks of solid rain, followed by hot weather and no rain for two weeks.  It, in essence, created a hard crust that the grass never was able to penetrate.  I am hoping that it will come back next year.  Either that, or I will have to come up with some convoluted reseeding plan.Dotty, the Speckled Sussex, is my constant companion and award-winningsnoopervisor.Checking the pussy willow for bugs.I also took down most of the duck compound fencing and reconfigured it for winter.  I do not let them have full run during most of the winter because they create havoc with the heated chicken waterer.  I have also decided to rehome the small coop, as I am not going to be raising meat chickens again and, if I do need to resupply the egg-laying flock, I am going to have them raise their own.  This will come as welcome news to two of the hens - who go broody at the drop of a hat.Betty Rubble in the foreground, CrazyMary behind her, Freddie the BeardedLady to the left, Gertie, then two unnamed girls.Gossip around the water pool.After I got the old fencing taken down and packaged for recycling, I had just enough time to rush inside, spiffy up and head out to meet my sister at the (dreaded) Garlic Festival.  It was a beautiful day for it.Nice day for cleaning waterbucketsI will interject here that I would rather have dental surgery than go to this festival.  In it's beginning, quite a few years ago, it was a small, quaint, mostly organic garlic festival that was all about garlic.  Standing by the honey vendor, lookingat the syrup vendor.It has morphed into a huge monster - crammed with booths that have little, if anything, to do with garlic.  This year, because of the weather forecast (Sunday was rain all day), it was PACKED.  I spent a half hour inching along the main route to reach the parking area.  Then you shuffled along with a mass of humanity (my least favorite thing ever) toward the entrance.  Then you were shoved along with the stream.  If it wasn't for the fact that my sister is a dear heart and I would do anything at all for her, I would have run in, grabbed my garlic and then headed in a straight line for the exit.  BUT.  I did managed to get half of my garlic seed and we did stumble upon a Vermont winery that had the most excellent ginger liqueur...  And there was one reason it was (almost) worth the agony - apart from being able to spend time with my sister...Fig tree!  Blonde du Blonde.That's right.  I bought a fig tree.  This will replace my poor figgy, which died at my hands this year.  I was very happy to also find that the fellow who grows these is gladly on hand (via the internet) to answer questions and help one along.  After another 20 minutes trying to get out of the parking lot, I did an errand or two and then headed home.  I stopped at my friend, Marianne's, to drop off eggs and got a 5 lb bag of organic apples, 10 lbs of RIPE tomatoes, three cucumbers, two zucchinis, and a bag of oyster mushrooms.  I may not even bother with a garden next year.  Honestly.Four kinds of delicious, beautiful, organic heirloom apples!Zucs and cukes!Sunday dawned with rain, which continued the entire day.  We got over an inch - and I'm not complaining, as it is a drop in the bucket, compared to other parts of the country.  Lovey and squished out during the lulls to do some fast weeding and pick whatever little was ripe.Rain dripping off my solar pergola lights.Two vege dishes were made - Sweet Corn and Zucchini Pie, a homestead favorite, and Tomato and Cheddar Pie - as well as a non-GF apple cake for the barn and the yard guy.  I did some adapting with the tomato pie, as I thought the amount of mayo was a little over the top for me.  Some housecleaning actually got done!  Some of M's beautiful tomatoes, sliced and drainingbefore becoming pie.As far as the Not-Good surprise, I have been working diligently on wrenching up the disintegrating top rail on my deck.  Apparently, the original owners did not choose to use pressure-treated wood when building the deck.  What I thought would be a fairly easy fix, is now turning out to be much more involved.  So far, the support 2x4 under the rail top on one portion will need to be replaced, along with at least one 4x4 post.  Poop.Sigh.More sighing."},

{"title": "Apples, Potatoes and a Fat Lip.", "date": "Monday, August 28, 2017", "text": "I've started making a working list off of The List (can you tell I am obsessed with lists?) that I can tackle over the weekends.  I mean, some of this stuff HAS to get done!  I am happy to say that I got all but three things done, and one of those was struck off - stop at a feed store for dog treats and canned cat food.  After my mother's remark that Lovey looked \"like a loaf of bread\", she is on a diet.  And so am I, in solidarity.  I have also decided to cut back on the feral cat food output, by giving them a can of wet food every other day, as opposed to every day with their kibble.  I might change that in the winter, depending on how they seem to be faring.I weeded a couple of raised beds and pulled the pathetic bean plants.  I also harvested the potatoes.BinjtesAs with the rest of the garden this year, it was a disappointing harvest.  I do buy my year's supply from a local farm, but there is nothing like growing some of your own to tide you over.  This year I planted only two kinds:  Red Norlands and Bintjes.  I have had a great deal of success with the Red Norlands.  Until this year.  A very small harvest - both in size of the spuds and number of the little devils.  My Bintjes were much better.  This is a potato that I discovered while living in The Netherlands and was thrilled to find organic seed potatoes here.  I probably got a 8:1 ratio of seed potatoes to harvest potatoes ~ yay!I also got the electric net fence up for the sheep, so that they could graze the hill.  I don't worry too much about them starving - as my mother would say, they are very loaf-shaped.  Linden is very much akin to a blimp on toothpicks.  Since all three are together at all times, it is very difficult to sort out any type of different feeding regimen.  Linden tends to fat (I can feel his pain), while Norman is like a pony and needs more protein.  The llama, of course, needs more than either of them.  I was very lucky to get a call from a neighbor who has an early apple tree that was dropping apples like crazy.  They are in the process of moving out of state, so they wanted to know if I'd like the drops for the animals.  I hotfooted it over and collected two five gallon buckets-worth!  I have been giving them apple treats since then.  Norman, however, will only eat apple peels.  He is an odd duck.Speaking of apples, on Saturday, Lovey and I whizzed through my errands, stopping at my friend, Marianne's, to drop off eggs.  She, in turn, gave me 12 pounds of an organic, heritage apple called State Fair, and a large bag of gorgeous RIPE tomatoes.  OMG.  On my agenda for Sunday was:  finish washing front of house and applesauce!  I also managed to bake some apple muffins for the barn - a hit, since over half the dozen disappeared in the first five minutes.  Before venturing into the kitchen on Sunday, I had to run the weed trimmer under the electric netting and get the sheep out.  As I yanked furiously at a stuck gate, it opened.  Fast.﻿After three hours under an ice cube compress.I am very thankful that the wire fence missed my face and that all I got was a fat lip from the impact of the PVC frame.  Lovely.One of the reasons I was looking forward to applesauce-making (other than the finished product) was that I would finally be able to use my birthday present to myself - an apple peeler/corer/slicer!  I had not opened it since I got it at the beginning of the year.  When I did, I learned two things:  Quit being so cheap and there should be a law about seeing the instructions online BEFORE buying a product.I knew I was in trouble as soon as I laid eyes on the 'instruction' sheet.  It's bad enough every cotton-picking-thing you buy is made in China (my \"Cheap\" lesson), but for Natssake, couldn't they hire someone who is at least reasonably fluent in English to write the instructions?  You can biggify, but here's the gist:\"III Operation Step:  *Fix (1) to the place as the structure schematic drawing; *Press (15) vigorously on the desktop, turn (14) by left hand (place as the picture show), the whole peeler fixed on the smooth desktop; Press (4), move the screw axis to the home position; *Stuck (15) by (11), let (6) far from the spiral rod, in order to make enough space to install an apple or a pear\", etc.  Please note:  Please put the pedicle on the tri-fork when fix the apple, pear.  Many bad things were said - in English - in the kitchen that morning.  I finally figured it out by trial and error.  I like the process but now hate my peeler.  However, Norman is very happy that he had quite a large bowl of peels - in varying degrees of length, width and depth.  I had, apparently, neglected to put the pedicle on the tri-fork."},
{"title": "Mind Wandering", "date": "Thursday, August 24, 2017", "text": "It's interesting what little bits of flotsam float around in my noggin.  Sometimes it's like a gentle flow, going around little flat rocks of conscious thoughts.  Other times, it's a churning sea of space junk.  Whoa.  I'm not sure where that came from.This morning, I was up early in the frosty August morning (anyone notice the discordant adjective there?), re-covered Lovey in her fleece blanket and tried to talk myself into finishing my iced coffee.  Brrr.  It was 46 degrees, for crimineysake.  I was bound and determined to get all my morning chores done and be out the door early, since I have to leave the office early on Friday - trying to make up some time so that it all doesn't get deducted from my PTO.  I was in fine form until.... I went to feed the barn cats and discovered the dairy farmer trying to round up a recalcitrant cow, who was leading him on a merry chase.  Unfortunately, his morning helper is less than helpful, having only one speed, which is reverse.I drove past the farmhouse and positioned my car across the road, hopefully blocking one escape route.  I then got out and got a rake and covered another hole.  This cow is a particular problem and the only reason she is not hamburger is that she is a good milker.  It's good to live in an area where a cow on the road does not throw people into a panic - nor do they sit in the road and blow their car horn because you are holding them up from IMPORTANT BUSINESS.  Two fellows in a dump truck stopped and got out to help and the four of us were able to get her moving in the right direction.Needless to say, I lost the advantage of an early-leave.  I had to double back and feed the cats, then drive into the city.*****I think the eclipse has melted the minds of quite a few people in the city.  I had to slam my brakes on six times, in order to avoid hitting the nimrods who a) threw their car doors open without looking to see if traffic was coming; b) walked out into the road between two parked cars - being mesmerized by the IMPORTANT BUSINESS on their phones; c) kept walking after the light turned green because (see b).  After a while, you wonder if you wouldn't be doing the world a favor by hitting some of these idiots.  But I didn't.*****I know that quinoa is the new hot thing in grains, but I have to admit to finding it incredibly irritating.  It's so tiny that it gets in between ones teeth - it reminds me of chewing on sand.  Which brings back unhappy memories of childhood on the beach.  The only thing I liked about the beach as a child were the sea shells, the birds and the mysterious piles of seaweed.  Other than that, it was hot.  Sand gets everywhere and it chafes.  All of the photographs my mother took of me on the beach at St. Pete shows a blond tot that looks like she bit a lemon.  Apparently, I took out my unhappiness by systematically snapping the plastic pants of my giant cousin of the same age.  He finally had enough and sat on me.*****My Cayuga duck, Cordelia, has taken to laying her egg in their pool.  What is up with that?  Does she just splash around and then - oops!?!  I am only getting one egg in the hut - thank you, Dimples - but am not complaining, as I am still (yay) up to my elbows in eggs.  I know the end of the bounty is near - evidenced by enough feathers in the coop to stuff a mattress - but I am very thankful that I am still getting plenty.  It will be interesting, as I slowly let the flock's numbers drop to a more manageable amount.  I am thinking a dozen.  Only 18 to go.*****I have officially killed my fig tree.  This makes me very sad.  I will have to start all over again, but am waiting until spring.  It will be rather a relief to be able to use more than a third of my dining room this winter.*****I have also been thinking about friends and friendship a lot.  I am very, very lucky to have such wonderful friends.  I don't have tons of friends, but I have the very best of friends.  I think that having friends is the most important thing in a person's life.  You know who you are and I love you."},
{"title": "Finding color in the garden or don't look for red tomatoes.", "date": "Monday, August 21, 2017", "text": "This has been, by far, the most odd (in a negative way) gardening season yet.  I have tons of green tomatoes and have, to date, harvested 12 grape tomatoes and two regular tomatoes.  I was lucky to get two quarts of beans.  My peppers are struggling.  BUT, for the first time - ever - I have multiple eggplant coming along.  Of the row of Swiss chard I planted, I have one spindly plant, while a volunteer from last year is huge.  The kale is fine.  The cukes are better than last year, but that's not saying much, as I only got one cuke last year.So, I enjoy color wherever I can find it.Volunteer cosmos by the squashMore cosmos - the picture doesn'tdo it justice - it is deep, bright orange.The only one of three dinnerplate dahlias that came up.I had a great day with my BFF Sylvia, who was visiting from Maine.  Friday was solid rain, but we managed to enjoy the art museum and a great Thai lunch.  She is my go-to person for all things that need an artistic hand/eye.  She is one of the few people I know (actually, the ONLY person I know) who can look at a space and visualize objects within it - all beautifully balanced.  She should have been an interior designer.  Once I get my act together, I will show you the results of her creative influence.  There are no photographs of the museum trip because, rain.  We got over an inch.  I tried a new recipe for dinner and it is going on the \"make again, make often\" list.  I found it in the latest issue of Living - Za'tar Roasted Chicken, Potatoes and Greens (or something along those lines).  It's a simple, one-dish recipe and if you don't have Za'tar, but you do have sumac trees, you can make your own!  I am so fond of this seasoning that I am going to do just that.Saturday morning was about errands done quickly because I had a long list to tackle.  Besides weeding, I had to assemble my new grill (the old one lasted over six years and it was the low-end model!  The guy at Home Depot was impressed...), cleaned off the deck, washed water buckets, put out the mineral block for the llama and sheep (and managed to escape with my life), then I made granola bars, cottage cheese, yogurt, and froze blueberries.  Saturday was also the day that Bertie left for his new home.  It was bittersweet and, although I am now able to breathe easier, we do miss him.  He is in very good hands and his mom reported back that he accompanied her to the farmers market, where she sells her beef every Sunday.  He was a smash hit, with much patting and kissing of his head and lots of attention.  She keeps him on a leash so that there will be no incidents, as many people bring their dogs to the market.  Lovey, meanwhile, has reverted to her anxious state and I am doing my best to reassure her.  We've had to resort to cocooning her in her blanket, much physical contact and I have to go outside with her every time she needs to go out.  Poor lamb.  To help us both through the transition, I made inside out cheeseburgers (Cynthia's Randall ground beef with a filling of garlic scape pesto and mozz) done to a turn on the new grill and a pile of sweet potato swirly fries, roasted in the oven!  We managed to get through the night...Pre-cookingReady to pop in the oven - I love my spiralizer!While weeding my little heart out, I looked at the front of the house and was reminded - for the umpteenth time - that I needed to wash it.  I rate washing the front and sides of my house right up there with latrine cleaning on an industrial level.  However, I pulled on my BGPs, got my environmentally-approved cleaner, a bucket, sponge and scrub brush and had at it.  Unfortunately, I was unable to use a power-washer because a) my vinyl siding is ancient and would be blasted off the house and b) my water source is at the far end and around the corner and would not reach.  So it was good old elbow grease that got it (mostly) done.Quite a contrast.I was able to get about 2/3 of the front of the house cleaned and will finish the front next weekend, weather permitting.  While I was grubbing around in the front, I weeded the heck out of the overgrown flower bed.  My original idea, after wrestling out the Barberry bushes, was to split my hostas and spread them along the left bed.  This hasn't happened - no surprise.  I am hoping to do it before the weather turns.The only break I took on Sunday was to pay a short visit to a group of women who are knitters, spinners, dyers and basket weavers.  The town just south of me was having a big hoopla to celebrate their 150th anniversary and this group of fiber artists were set up at one of the oldest farms in the area.Dying, spinning, knitting and basket-weaving going on.I adore miniature donkeys.  Anotherbig attraction at this farm.Angling for a head-scratch.I made yet another new dish last night, but was too pooped to drag out the camera.  It was Mediterranean Zucchini Noodles and it was GOOD!  As  you can tell, I am all about the spiralizer this summer.  The dish was a snap - spiralize your zucchini into spaghetti size, then throw chopped fresh tomatoes (thank you, Marianne), garlic, sundried tomatoes, capers, chopped ripe olives, oregano, and a slurp of EVOO into a pan.  Pour it over your zoodles, add slivered fresh basil and some crumbled feta cheese and delicioso!"},
{"title": "Beef and a Beef", "date": "Wednesday, August 16, 2017", "text": "Last weekend, the result of many weeks of negotiating, hard work (none of it mine...) and coordination of various trailers, farm hands and meshing of schedules, came to fruition.A portion of my friend, Cynthia's, Randall cattle have moved onto my other friend's beautiful farm.  Everyone is thrilled - especially the cows!  To learn more about this lovely, endangered breed and Cynthia's 20+ year journey to bring them back from the edge of extinction, go here.  Now, onto a beef(s) of another stripe.  As background - almost totally unrelated because, well, I tend to ramble on - I do not watch television (my small screen is used only for DVD viewing - I have no dish, satellite or other connection), have refused to listen to the radio since last November and do not get a daily paper.  A few weeks ago, while out with my sister, I managed to get myself strong-armed into signing up for four-day delivery of our largest local newspaper.  They hit me at a weak point - in JoAnn Fabrics, of all places - with the offer of a $20 gift card and a limited subscription.  Since we live in the sticks, they have to hire someone to deliver the newspapers in the wee, early hours of the morning.  This is how my very limited subscription rolled out - Thursday: a paper delivered.  Friday:  no paper delivered.  Saturday:  see Friday.  Sunday:  paper delivered.  I called customer service and advised them of the missing papers.  I was credited.  Next week - wash, rinse, repeat.  Third week - I made it to Friday morning and then called customer service and cancelled.  It was then I was informed that my 'credits' meant that they extended my subscription by the number of papers not delivered.  Wonderful.  Not only would the Thursday and Sunday - apparently, the only two days where a live brain cell connected with conscious thought - be stretched out forever, there was so little of the newspaper to read that it was not worth the effort.  I kid you not when I say that a good 65% of the paper was advertisements.Another beef - actually the original beef that got lost in the random beefs above - is the food editor of this paper and her latest local 'star' chef.  We may live in the capitol of the state, but there is very little of the sophistication (and money) of the unofficial capitol downstate, no matter how hard they try.  I am assuming that the food editor - her little blurb contains many references to her British-ness - was looking for something to do to fill her days, or else a good way to get tax-deductible meals.  She is so verbose and tiresome, that you long for a pair of scissors about two-paragraphs in (and she takes up most of the front section page and part of an inside page!)  I digress - again.  It may just be me, but this description of a four-star dish, really rankled me:  Veal cutlet, Marsala mushrooms, soft polenta, a sunnyside egg, and arugula.  In a heap.  I may not be a gourmand, but veal is pretty mild in the first place, let alone buried under wined mushrooms, a bland glob of mush and a runny egg.  I suppose the arugula is so that it has some color, other than tan, yellow and white, and a bit of flavor.It seems apparent, even to me, that I need another latte to offset the onset of crankypants."},
{"title": "Food, Fun, Fotos and Bon Voyage, Lacy.", "date": "Monday, August 14, 2017", "text": "The weekend started off with a gathering (all too rare now) of the Girlz Night girlz.  There are three of us and we used to get together once a month, rotating between houses.  It was fun and the only time I partake in a martini (I'm a light-weight).  Then lives got busy and complicated and one of the three bought a second house on Cape Cod.  That was not, obviously, me.  It has fizzled down to maybe once a season, so this was a nice surprise.  The other thing that has changed quite a bit is the length of the gathering.  We start at 6 and we used to carry-on until almost 10.  Now, we were out the door and in our cars at 8.  N's local house is on the market and soon it will be two.  Sigh.Saturday was an interesting day, as I am now making myself open to whatever happens and not beating myself about the head and shoulders over not focusing on my list(s).  I had a good start - four loads of laundry done, sea salt & dark chocolate granola made, refrigerator pickles tucked in the new fridge, water buckets cleaned and refilled, weeds wacked, when I chanced on a Freecycle listing for kombucha scobys.  Woot!  My poor scoby, which I had so carefully dried to keep it on hand, did not rehydrate well.  The offer was limited to that day, so I bundled the dogs into the car and off we went.  I am so glad we did!  The woman's house was in Vermont, down a gravel road to a dirt road to the dead end.  The only house on the road, up in the mountains.  It was like driving into Eden.  She gave me the largest, most healthy-looking scoby I have every seen.  She was in the middle of canning, but took the time to share her vast kombucha knowledge.  She was great!  It was also great that she didn't have chickens, as I took along a dozen fresh eggs as a thank you gift.Everything was put aside as I rushed home to brew up some sweet tea.  I now have a half-gallon burbling on the counter, with the other half of the scoby in a scoby 'hotel'.  That took a large chunk out of the middle of my day, so I settled for steam cleaning the living room rug (Sylvie's coming!) and cleaned bathrooms, counters and swept mounds of orange fuzz.  Speaking of orange fuzz, Bertie, aka The Yam, will most likely be going to his new mom this coming weekend.  I have, not surprisingly, conflicting emotions about it.  But it is definitely for the best, as he deserves a good home with someone who will love him without reserve.For Mama Pea - my newfridge in all it's packed-solid glory.Saturday night, I tried a new recipe that is definitely a keeper!  I love all things zucchini, so when I saw the recipe for zucchini ravioli, it went to the top of the heap.  I managed to get it in the oven before the fireworks started (severe storm warnings were beeping on my phone from 6P on) and I ended up eating dinner with Slimby curled in a quivering ball on my lap.  Not an easy maneuver.The recipe is from Half-Baked Harvest and turned out wonderfully, even with my ever-present alterations.  I did not have feta so used ricotta and shredded Pepper Jack, and I added some cooked corn to the filling.  I also got to use my new favorite baking dish, purchased for an amazingly low price while shopping with my sister in NH.  And it is NOT made in China!My grape tomatoes and basil, Marianne's heirloomtomatoes.  In my beautiful dish.Zucchini ravioli on their way into theoven!Zucchini ravioli on their way into me!I also found a recipe for zucchini pizza crust, which is next on my list.  Right after the zucchini fritters.  And zucchini bread.Sunday I made scones for National Scone Week and took them to the barn crew with my homemade blueberry jam.  They are now scone converts, having never had a scone before.  Speaking of my homemade jam, I have now begun the Great Purge.Part two (of many) of the Great PurgeSo far, I have jettisoned sixteen pints of assorted unidentified jamish type of things, two years' worth of non-jellied currant jelly - you get the picture.  Above, there are pickled blueberries (why? why?) and more currant jelly-that-isn't.  And rhubarb chutney from 2009.  Obviously, I do not eat chutney, nor does anyone else in my circle of family and friends.  Hopefully, the chickens will enjoy it.  If not - compost!  I tremble at the thought of what else is lurking in the dark shelves of my canning cabinet...Sunday was also the day we celebrated my dad's and my second dad's (my neighbors) birthday.  Dad will officially be 95 on Wednesday, while Ray was 93 the previous Wednesday.  My sister's house was the perfect venue (I love her house) and most of our family gathered - we were only missing my nephew from NH and his family, but they were there in our hearts.  A local woman and friend provided live music and it was a very nice get-together.  Martha is a very accomplished violin and fiddle player and has a wide circle of musician friends that she can call on for small gatherings.  This time she was joined by a delightful and talented young man who played the flute.  At my sister's birthday, three years ago (!!) she was accompanied by a keyboard.  It was wonderful!Tuning up on the beautifuldeckL-R My Aunt Josie (Mom's sister), Bea (Mom#2, Mom, Dad, my youngest sister.  Foreground: our fourth sister, Barb, my nephew, Austin and hislovely new bride, Rachel.On the right:  my dog-nephew, Jasper, with my BIL, and Dad2 in the hat.BFFs, Bea and my momThe old cutie, Dad, with his loot.I made a few stops on my way home, and then let the dogs out and made a quick pass through my garden.  OMG.  I have an actual tomato harvest:I had to laugh - I have been stalking that tomato for days, waiting for it to turn red.  It is an orange tomato.  LOL!It's going to be another wild week of unproductive (in list-shrinking terms) days, but I have two friends scheduled to drop by tonight - hopefully during chore time.... then my BFF is coming into town from Maine and I have taken Friday off.  Then Bertie goes home with Cynthia Saturday... then, POOF, the weekend is gone!  I do still have Sunday, but there is a big festival all weekend at the town just south of me and some of the activities are just too alluring...Before I sign off, I would like to say a little about a wonderful chicken.  Lacy passed away yesterday at the ripe old age of 10.  She was an all-around excellent hen.  Lacy was a silver-laced Wyandotte that I adopted when my dear, sweet, Rosie had to disburse her flock.  Lacy was the matriarch of the henhouse for years, until this one.  She had been demoted to the bottom, but the other hens were never hard on her.  I will miss seeing her rocket out of the coop in the morning.  I will miss her gentle burbles and clucks as she followed me around.  Bon voyage, sweet girl."},

Speaking of blueberries, in my effort to sort out and find room for the fridge freezer contents, I discovered a gallon bag of last year's blueberries!  Yikes!  I am due to do my annual picking soon, so the Barn Crew got Blueberry Cake for breakfast.It was a hit!There is nothing like an archeological dig through your fridge.  I discovered a bottle of sake that dates from....?  Then there are the three fish sauce containers, three kinds of mustard, lone bottle of root beer, gin-soaked golden raisins that were supposed to prevent some illness or condition if eaten daily, etc.  I see an interesting trip to both the compost pile and the recycling station in my very near future."},

Luckily, I found a replacement tap online, so I am hoping that it works and that I can actually use it.The only thing I like right now,is that it is a good size - 1 gal.I also fed the farm cats and visited with my Jasmine, dropped of baked goods and shared gossip with the farmer.  And trotted home with a milk can of fresh milk!  This is a perfect size - it holds exactly one gallon and one quart.  That was enough for two batches of Mama Pea's cottage cheese and a quart of yogurt.While the cheese was 'cheesing', I went outside and tackled a few of the items on The List.  Laundry was washed and hung on the line.  I started to re-sink the posts on the ducks' enclosure, but I kept hitting rock.  I am going to have to reconfigure the fencing.  I also 'hilled' the potatoes, meaning I added another tire and filled it with compost.  I was one tire short, so I had to improvise on the last one with a length of plastic fencing.  We'll see how it does.  I moved my small, short bird bath into the front garden, and exchanged it for a larger, graceful one that I got for an outrageously low price from my friend, Nancy.  She had a vintage/antique business for years and is now in the process of drastic downsizing so they can sell their house and move to Cape Cod.   I did some weeding, but there is so much still to do.  Before I collapsed, I took a few shots of the garden - weeds and all.  There's much more to do, but we are making progress.  Red currants are coming!﻿Beans - note spotty germination.  But, really, how many bean plants does oneperson need?Onions.  I planted them closer thanusual, because I use every other one forscallions.Two-tier-tire potato plants in foreground,with jerry-rigged extension inbackground.  Bintjas.Weedy pepper bed with volunteerkaleTomatoesThree kinds of squashThings are coming along.  The trouble is, everything needs weeding and I don't have the focus to stay with one bed until it's finished.  This results is the chicken-without-a-head approach that doesn't do much good.  I have been working on the two beds in the front of the house, as it dawned on me that my entryway looks like crap, to be blunt.  I had pulled out the barberry bushes, covered it with weed cloth, and put just enough wood mulch on it to hold it down.  Then promptly forgot it existed.  Which is no easy task, as I have to walk by it at least twice a day.  I started to develop the raised bed on the parallel side of the front walk.  It is about half done.  You can see where this is heading - then there is the flower bed in the back, which is about one-third done, and the old herb bed which is completely taken over by mint.  I'd clone myself, if it wouldn't be unfair to the world to have two of me in it.  There always seems to be some interruption...Last night, as I was taking down my laundry and heading in to make dinner, there was a big barney in the hoop house.  As I glanced over, I saw the big, bully rooster chasing a slightly smaller rooster out of the door and into the fence.  Which zapped the poor guy.  Who then lost his pea-sized mind and started racing from corner to corner, bully in close pursuit, getting zapped at every turn.  I high-tailed it down, rescued the reeling roo and then turned the stink eye on the bully.  He shot out of the fence and I managed to corral him and get him by one leg.  I then heaved him over the fence, where he landed with a splat on the ground.  That knocked the starch out of him for quite a while.  By the time I was ready to close them up for the night, he had recovered and was sidling back inside.  Hah, I thought.This morning, he was at it again, so I grabbed him by two legs and hauled him into the duck yard and into the isolation unit.  Where he will stay until he goes off to Freezer Camp next Saturday.  Honestly."},

The Creek's Rising!", "date": "Monday, May 15, 2017", "text": "I checked my egg diary (yes, I have one and have kept it religiously for 11 years) and it has rained for almost 14 days straight.  This is not conducive to gardening.  Or about anything else except duck-watching.  Even the ducks seem tired of it.  All that greyness has ratcheted my energy level to 1.Last Thursday I reached the end of my tether and went straight out after work and cleaned out the small coop.  I ran the power out and set up a nice fluffy layer of shavings.  At 5:30 the next morning, I was hooking up the light, putting out water and food, and trotting the Nuggets out in the cat carrier.  I then trotted back in, had a nice latte and wallowed in the chick-less-ness of my laundry room.Saturday was supposed to rain all day, but we were in luck and it didn't start until 3:15.  I gave myself a pep talk, had three large lattes, and threw myself into action!  That break from the downpours let me run to the food pantry, pick up feed, go to the post office and library, and make it back to tackle the raised beds.  I got five beds rough-hoed, three of those ready for planting, put the hoops up over my (please god) pepper and eggplant bed, adjusted the framework over the blueberry and currant bushes, and made it in before it poured.  And boy, did it!  I think we must have gotten well over 5 inches of rain since mid-April.  It's crazy.  And cold.  I also muscled my Meyers Lemon tree out onto the deck (where the pergola has not been built, sigh), with fervent apologies.  It is not supposed to drop to frost levels, but it did get down to 38*.  I'm keeping a close eye on it.  I need to get the giant fig tree out, but that is a two-person job.  Maybe three.  Everything deck-wise is hinging on the building of the pergola.  But, until we get some dry weather, that's not happening.All the powdered sugar sank into the buttery surface.I baked a new variety of cookie for the Barn Guys - Mexican Chocolate Crinkles.  I can't tell you if they were tasty, as this was not a GF recipe, but they were fighting over the last one, so I take that as a good sign.  It may have been the stick-and-a-half of butter....  Mine did not have a nice, white, powdery sugar surface, but they seemed very moist and chewy.  A keeper.  I also baked a strawberry rhubarb crisp for Mother's Day Dinner on Sunday.  It was a new recipe and, while I did like the topping, the fruit was very liquid-y.  The person who wrote the recipe that I 'based' my crisp on was very adamant about not adding cornstarch or any other filler.  She must have 'special, precious' fruit.  LOL.  It tasted fine, though, and my sister made an amazing dinner of sautéed shrimp and mushrooms with cheesy grits.  OMG.  Everyone was moaning around the table!  Isn't she something?  And at 93!This falls under the category of DUH.  For quite some time, I have had a lot of trouble with my lower back, hips, knees - you name it.  I wrote it off to age and abuse.  However, the weekend my sisters were over, as I was putting fresh sheets on my bed, I noticed that my mattress had a definite swayback look to it.  I then stood and tried to figure out how old it was.  Good lawd.  It has to be close to 30 years old.  As an experiment, I have been sleeping in the guest room - on the new mattress (less than 10 years old).  The first morning I woke up, tentatively put feet on the ground and...it was a miracle!  Yesterday, I took a deep, shaky breath and bought a new mattress.  What the heck are they stuffing these things with?  Fifty-dollar bills?  Geezlouise.  I tried to convince myself that it was an important investment in my overall health.  But, what I gain in physical health I may lose in emotional trauma.   It arrives in all its glory on Saturday.  It will be nice to be back in my own room - The Pepperoni is so confused."},

{"title": "e-i-e-i-olio!", "date": "Tuesday, May 9, 2017", "text": "I have been waiting for an occasion to use that word - \"olio\" - one of my favorite crossword puzzle words that seem to be archaic.   O-li-o (noun); another term for olla podrida; a miscellaneous collection of things; a variety act or show.  That describes the last four days to a 't'.Besides the fact that everything now squishes - six straight days of rain (although we have a break as I type), with at least six more coming up - my life has taken on the neon colors of barely-controlled chaos.  I'd like to say that I've grown so accustomed to this that I just roll with the currents.  But that would not be the truth.  As always, I face my life as a salmon - always fighting to go upstream.  Gah.I had taken Friday off so that I could whip the house into shape and get ready for my youngest sister's birthday bash.  Well, bashette - none of us stays up past 9:30.  The three sisters were going to merge at the LLF and feast on lobster, carrot rice, roasted asparagus, excellent champagne, and flourless chocolate cake (aka a slab of fudge).  Connie came over early and we got into gear.  In the rain.  Of course.  Cynthia had to drive up from The City through floods and pestilence and arrived around 7:30.  ﻿Chocolate cake by the light ofthe strange birthday candle/musicbox that eventually needed to bedestroyed...Things were going swimmingly until the clock struck 9.  Then the power went out.  And stayed out.  Thankfully, the champagne carried us through until bed time.  I was not able to sleep, however, because I could get no information about when the power would be restored and I had three brooders of chicks in the dark with no heat.  I paced and heaved and sighed all night.  Around midnight, aided by my headlamp, I divided the chicks into two groups for warmth and then swaddled the brooders with a down comforter.  It was a good thing that they were mostly feathered (except their fuzzy heads) and were able to maintain enough warmth to keep themselves comfortable.By the time daylight arrived (with more rain and wind), there was still no word on power restoration.  I pulled on my waders and slogged out to the generator and got it going.  I am so glad I have it - but it is a small one and not able to power more than one thing at a time.  That meant a rotating schedule of Freezer #1, Brooders, Freezer #2.  The fridge was on its own, not to mention the total lack of running water.  That sent both sisters off early in the morning - you do NOT want three women in the house with no flushing toilets.  Trust me on this.  Saturday was spent with my phone alarm going off every two hours, so that I could unplug one thing and plug in the next thing.  Finally, by late afternoon, the utility company put an estimated restoration time of 11PM on their web site.  I doubted I would be upright by 11PM, so I opted to stay up as along as I could, then cut off the generator and flip the main switch back on.  I tossed and turned until 3A, when the power finally came back on.Sunday was spent cleaning up Friday's dishes and lots of inside work.  Because...it was raining.  I almost forgot that Monday was Shearing Day and had to dash out in the drizzle to set up the barn so that the sheep would be dry.  I slept very well Sunday night.Monday morning dawned overcast, windy and raw, but not raining!  After rushing through the basics, I jumped in the car and drove north to Melanie's, where we rassled small, woolly, horned eel bodies from her sheep cote downhill, alllllll the way up to her front porch, where the power lay.  I was staggering and gasping by the time we got them all in the pen she set up.  Man, oh, man.  Shetlands are small but wiry!  Most of them had horns, so they provided good handles - but they also provided a series of bruises up and down both legs.  The shearer was an hour late, so we got some visit time in, which was a bonus.  Joe working on an itty-bittyShetland.  I love my shearer.Some beautiful fleece!Then down the road to stop number two - one sheep with his giant ox friend.  Since this is already a windy post, I will add a little background on this wild sheep.  He was an escapee from a meat sheep herd,  at least 15 miles to the northeast, outside of our town.  He spent months being spotted but never caught.  How he managed to travel up the mountain, through coyote, bear and bobcat country and survive, speaks of his innate wildness.  He ended up sauntering into a friend's barn and planting himself between his pair of giant, gentle oxen.  And there he stayed.  Unfortunately, one of the oxen died in the fall of bone cancer.  The remaining boy seemed very lonely and stuck to his sheepie companion.  An odd couple.Joe is close to 6' tall.   Just sayin'.The odd coupleDown the mountain we went to tackled my two fat eels, then down the road to another neighbor for three sheep, an angora goat and two alpacas.  While the neighbor stood, listing and re-listing all his ailments (real or imagined, or both), Joe and I did all the labor.  Honestly.  But it gave me some time to assess this guy's LGDs - who are in sorry shape.  As my shearer noted, love is great but not enough when it comes to animals.  You need to provide care.  At least we make sure whomever needs it gets shorn each year (although the angora goat needs shearing 2x a year - Joe must have sheared off over 20 lbs of matted, filthy fiber).  And don't get me started on hooves.  While the neighbor nattered on, I got a curry comb and started on one of the Maremmas.  The female is friendly - the male is extremely wary.  It was all I could do, not to load both of them in my car and take them home.By the time I got home, all I wanted was a soft chair and a cup of tea (did I mention that the wind howled through the barn and it spitted snow on us for two hours?)  Instead, I find blood running down Linden's face and Norman sporting red polka dots all over.  Apparently, spring is in the air and, once the fleece is off, feelings run high.  Or they turn into idiots - take your choice.  I managed to slap some blood-stop on Linden's broken scur, then I left them to it.  They eventually calmed down and there was - of course - the rain to clean things up.  Double gah.On a more mundane (thank goodness) note, I have found my new Favorite Thing.  I ended up making the breakfast I had planned for my sisters, for myself on Sunday.  Baked eggs in crispy prosciutto cups.  OMG.  That led to finding MORE prosciutto in the fridge for another round for the freezer, and then little spinach quiches in muffin cups, too  I am on a roll!  Pepperoni got his summer buzz cut and looks much less fat than I thought he would.  Losing all that hair really put some zing in his step, and he's been orking around like a looney tune since Sunday.  Best of all?   Yesterday evening, just when I was going to slip batch number 2 of my muffin madness into the oven, my handyman arrived with the wood for my pagoda!  Woohoo!  Building starts this week!  If it ever stops raining, that is.  Maybe I should save it for an ark.Beady little eyesStream-lined for summer.  If itever arrives.Wake us up when the sun comes out."},

b) honest to a fault; c) reasonable; and d) pretty darn handy in many areas.  He and his also-young wife are expecting their first child and I know that extra money will come in handy.  It is a win-win-win situation.  I whipped up the sketch above and from that shaky rendition, he was able to figure out a materials list.  He and his wife came over last night and we hashed out the details, although I am still trying to pry an estimate for labor out of him.  He is worried he may estimate at too high a price.  Sigh.  I had to reiterate what an estimate was.  Just as an aside, he used to provide firewood for a neighbor down the hollow.  This guy was either high or drunk 20 out of 24 hours in the day.  He brews beer.  Big surprise.  Billy (young guy) would deliver the firewood, get paid, then two days later, the neighbor would show up at his door to pay him again because he forgot he had already paid.  They used to argue about it!  Billy finally quit working with him because of it.  Top that.Once his labor estimate is in and we decide where to buy the lumber, it's all systems go!  Another project checked off The List.Progress is slow in the seed-starting arena.  My celery seeds did not germinate.  It's been long enough to incubate a duck egg, so I am thinking they are toast.  It could be due to the fact that I am triply distracted with outside work, inside work, the Nuggets, and Mr. Picky.Progress has been made, however, with Mr. Picky's eating issues.  I have now arrived at the fact that Bertie has a sensitive system (as witnessed by the beating my hall rug has been taking) and is prone to food boredom.  Gone is the poached chicken - enter the lightly sautéed ground beef.  With sticky rice.  And just ever-so-much expensive kibble.  Luckily, the other two would eat wallpaper paste if it was in their dish, so nothing is wasted but my time.  Meal prep is complicated and time-consuming.  I am waiting to finish up the poached chicken and then everyone gets ground beef.  Honestly.Even though I have one of my mom's socks still on the needles (and needing to be frogged down to the basic foot because it is too short), a mock-turtle neck, sleeveless black cotton top about 3/4 done - for the last four years - a pair of socks for me started, and a pile of cup cozies started as well, I was drawn like a moth to a flame to this project:I had never heard of Caron Cake yarn.Where have I been?!Curse you, Cheryl (of Acorn to Oak)!  And, thank you, too!  I saw her Caron Cake shawl on her blog (she is so amazingly creative - it boggles) and I was hooked.  I have just started on the decrease part and am determined to finish at least ONE project - especially a large, worsted-weight wool project - before the onset of summer.  *In the ongoing saga of \"What Next!?!\", someone - I think it's a joint effort by The Pepperoni and Lovey - was opening TP's crate during the day.  This involved pulling up a lever and moving it to the left.  My fix was to use a carbinger clip on the flip-up handle and, so far, it's working!"},

Plan C.  Since I had to leave the house anyway, I decided to drop eggs off at the food pantry, stop at the library and make a run through the transfer station.  I then remembered that I had not gotten my 2017 transfer station pass, so added a trip to the town clerk's office.  Needless to say, half the day was gone by the time I got back home.  There was some frantic planting of onions, cleaning, weeding and mulching of the strawberry bed, and the spring cleaning of the duck huts.  ﻿﻿﻿\"After\"This design has worked out well.I decided to spare you the \"Before\", but you can tell how bad it was by  the high 'water' mark on the wall of the first pic - biggify to see, if you dare.  You will also notice that the ducks refuse to use the nice nesting box I included in the design of this hut.  It's become their personal latrine.  They always lay their eggs in the same spot.  The girls were so thrilled about their clean digs, that they went in and out three or four times, quacking loudly in delight.  I choose to think it was delight and not, \"About time, lady!\"Leggy Seedling Alert!Herb seedlingsI ended up having to buy separate fixtures and different bulbs for the seedlings.  As you can see on the first tier, the seedlings (lettuce and kale) got all leggy on me because I a) did not have the right light above them and b) had it too far away.  Isn't it good that I took that seed starting workshop?  Geez.  I planted celery in the six-pack next to them and the tray below is planted with oregano (could those seeds be any smaller?  I think not.), parsley, basil, chervil, and cilantro.  There is more seed-starting in store for this weekend.My favorite view from the kitchen.Although I'm trying hard not to get too giddy about the onset of spring - it can be so cruel - it's hard not to think that it is finally here and here to stay.  The sun has been out for over two days!  We did have rain, but it was not a gusher and happened overnight.  My favorite kind.  I set up one of the rain barrels and it was filled the next morning.  I am planning on setting up another in the chicken/duck yard.  This, I hope, will save me wear and tear, toting 5 gal. buckets of water from the barn to the back.Grass!  Dogs!Even the inside plants are rarin' to get outside!Over-wintered geraniumsFIG TREE! and Meyers Lemon tree.  Can't wait until the jungle is outside.Another sign that spring has sprung?The last time it will be this clean.The Nuggets are arriving at any moment.  ***Make that HAVE ARRIVED!***  I have such a bone to pick with the USPS.  I signed up for their text service - which was to alert me by text at every change in status.  I started with \"Label has been generated\" and there it stayed.  I checked it this morning six or seven times.  Still at the label stage.  Then I got to work, opened my phone and had six messages from the USPS and one from my post office.  Apparently, they magically went from label to delivered in less than two hours!  Amazing!  Spectacular!  Baloney!  I had to call my neighbor to ask him to pick them up and hold them for me.  I can, hopefully, leave early to go fetch them and get them snugged in.  I am not a happy camper.  I will do a separate post with garden-type pics, once I can get myself out there with my camera.  Not that there is much to see, but at least there is no snow.  Wait.  Can I take that back?  Did I just put the big Hinky Jinky on myself?"},

Although I have come to embrace the power of Pink, there is only so much of it that I am willing to clasp.  After knitting three hats, I still had quite a bit left of the skein of bubblegum pink yarn - what to do....  We all know that I am adamantly against waste, so it must be used!  I think I've come up with a plan.  And it involves a giveaway...details to come when it's finished.Bertie continues to make progress.  He is a tater tot of a baby hippo, with the most endearing folds and wrinkles under his chin.  Gah.  I do have to keep reminding myself that he is still a puppy, even though he has an old man's face.  Lovey was also two when she came to me, but she was a whole nuther banana.  This one is very self-confident, has extremely limited focus and was born to chew.  I managed to rescue an ill-placed hiking boot before it was unwearable, and I have been finding most all of my mittens, ear warmers and scarves outside.  Until he gets the house rules under his belt/collar, Bertie is crated when I am not around him.  It works well, as he needs to be kept quiet for a while until his kennel cough is better.Bertie is gradually meeting the rest of the inhabitants - he met Linden through the fence, nose-to-nose.  It's Linden's duty, as Head Sheepie, to check out all newcomers.  He took a sniff, snorted and did a hasty retreat.  Bertie barked his head off.  There are crows and squirrels.  There are chickens.  There are ducks.  There are crunchy treats.  As we work him into our routine, there have been some 'bumps'.  When I get home from work it is dark (surprise...not).  I let everyone out of various crates, put my boots on (careful to put my work shoes on the table), then we all pile out of the back door and out into the chicken yard.  While Lovey was never brave enough to squeeze through a dark, open chicken door, Bertie has no such qualms.  I managed to snag him before he was totally inside.  I left them to run around while I went in the person door and checked for eggs.  There is no light in the coop, with the exception of my headlamp.  I left the coop, shut the door and headed over to the duck house and closed them in.  As I walked toward the deck, I heard some kerfuffle from the coop - nothing new there.  I called Bertie.  And called.  And called.  No Bertie.  (Sound of the other shoe dropping)  Coop!!!  I beat a hasty path to the coop and there he was - having silently slipped in behind me - with chicken in mouth and one on the floor.  OMG.  I shooed him out and checked the hens - both were alive but damp and more than a bit traumatized.  I put one hen in a nesting box so she could recover and the other hopped onto the roost, apparently no worse for wear.   In the morning, both were fine.  He is not a vicious dog, but he is very BUSY.While there is definitely more work involved, now that Bertie is one of us (the hall rug must be scrubbed this weekend, shoes and boots are no longer handy by the door), he is definitely worth it.  I am hoping to get a video (then garner enough technical skills to upload it to the blog - haha) of the two dogs playing.  It's like watching a baby hippo on a mad trot, chasing a gazelle.Potato Leek Soup is on this weekend's menu - leeks were sliced and frozen from my organic bonanza at the best farmers market EVER in South Portland, ME.  I'm having a friend over for dinner on Sunday, so I am fishing out a small turkey breast, making mashed potatoes from my stores, and creamed corn from my frozen corn.  I've got lots of bits and bobs in the freezer that I need to use up, so this week's meal planning should be fusion at its weirdest!"},
{"title": "Where to begin...", "date": "Tuesday, January 24, 2017", "text": "On Saturday, I drove a half hour southwest because I was expecting a special delivery.  This package came all the way up from Alabama.  It was a rather surprise package, as I hadn't planned on delivery for quite some time and I had no (well, a little) idea of what this package would contain.NOT from Amazon.comMeet OnceBennyNowBertie.  He had the same foster mother as Lovey.  That woman can be persuasive.Where the heck am I?Needless to say, things were interesting on the LLF this weekend.Introductions were a little spastic, but once I got Bertie and Lovey on leads and out the door, all friction was forgotten and both noses were going gangbusters, side by side.  Overall, it was a very smooth transition - The Pepperoni was introduced through his crate door (he is still recovering from his near-pneumonia), Bertie ignored the cats, and, aside from the occasional all-show-showing of teeth when competing for my attention, it was great.Then Bertie developed Kennel Cough.  It's like Whooping Cough for dogs.  I can tell you the exact moment it manifested itself - 12:33A Monday morning.  I am glad I had planned to take the day off because there was another trip to the vet - where we were ushered in through the back door, Typhoid-Mary-like.  It's very contagious.  Now I have two dogs on antibiotics but at least Bertie manages to get his Robitussin down without drama.  Lovey got a booster on her vaccine and we are hoping it works.We love Bertie.  Love him.  He is a difficult dog to describe - part Basset (short legs), maybe some Lab (lethal tail, chunky body), and then some Heinz 57.  He came to us as Ben, but did not respond to his name at all.  My vet and I were trying to figure out a good name, when the vet tech said, \"He looks like a little lion, ala Bert Lahr.\"  I said \"Bertie\", and he looked up.  It stuck.  Kennel Cough and all, he is a delightful playmate for Lovey, has an endearingly lovable personality, and is different enough from my beloved Scrappy to not cause my heart to break every time I look at him.*****Needless to say, not a lot got done this long weekend, although I am still sticking to my meal planning and it is going along swimmingly.  I had so much leftover soup that I didn't have to make any this weekend - a plus, considering - and I tried a new salad recipe that I really like: Citrus Rice Salad with Parmesan.  It lasts and gets better with age, paired well with a nice piece of broiled Ahi Tuna I found in my freezer, and will be a quick dinner fix.  I also delved into my Moosewood cookbook collection and made a Tunisian Frittata with Spicy Tomato Sauce.  Good!  Also has a good rate of keep-ability, so that will interplay with the salad for dinner/lunch over the week.  I whipped up another batch of Strawberry Cheesecake Oatmeal - using the last of my strawberries - and made a batch of granola.  Am I the only one who feels both euphoria and dread when using up something out of the freezer?  I am half thrilled to be using something up, while harboring a dread that I will go hungry because I am using up my food.  *****The weather is...weird.  We have had the longest stretch of unseasonably warm, gloomy weather that I can ever remember in January.  The sun came out - finally - on Sunday and lasted for 15 minutes.  I dropped everything and sent out and sat on the deck steps, faced it and closed my eyes.  I sat there for the full 'duration'.  Then, starting last night, the temps dropped and I woke up to two inches of sleet.  It was quite a shock for Bertie, but he is a stalwart fellow and, after a brief pause on the doorstep, charge out into the cold unknown.*****I wore my pussyhat all day Saturday and cataloged a variety of reactions - 95% were positive and supportive.  5% were the expected nasty comments.  Bertie put the brakes on when he first saw me.  After all, when I do pink (finally), I do bubblegum pink.  I guess he figured that it wasn't any more alarming than two days in a crate in a dark truck, emerging into foreign everything.  The sheep froze, backed up slowly and stared at me.  It is currently resting atop the plaster cast of \"Don\" that my father did and gave me for my 40th birthday.  It will be a constant reminder of the mindfulness that I need to practice to safeguard my - and every woman's/human's/animal's/planet's - rights going forward.  PussyHat!  Hear me roar!Rrrarr!﻿"},

{"title": "And then there was Winter.", "date": "Tuesday, November 22, 2016", "text": "On Friday, looking ahead to the forecast, I scurried to get the bulk of the most important 'winterizing' things done before the four inches of snow on Sunday.  This proved rather pleasant, as Saturday's temperature was close to 70, with gentle breezes and sunshine.  Jumpin' Jehoshaphat.  When I looked out of the window on Sunday, I thought I had been transported to another dimension.  Instead of the four inches, we got 20.  And that was on the low end for our area.  Trees down?  Check.Power outage?  Check.Snow load?  Check.Wine?  Check.It had started early Sunday morning, so I was able to get out and leave a big pile 'o food for the feral cat I feed at the barn.  That was the last time I was able to leave the house until this morning.  It pulled trees down until they snapped.  It came down heavy and wet.  I had to use the roof rake on the car port twice and gawd knows how many times I shoveled my usual network of paths.The ducks are in shock.  There was loud, indignant quacking going on in the duck hut Sunday morning, but when I finally shoveled to their door and opened it, there was silence.  Four little heads stretched out on long necks and then shot back inside.  The older chickens weren't happy, but know the drill.  The younger ones spent all their time trying NOT to touch the evil cold wet stuff.And it snowed and snowed and snowed.  The power went out just as I was about to plug in my batch of yogurt, so I wrapped it in a towel and shoved it into a cooler.  We were lucky, as our power was only out for about five hours.  The area just south of us didn't get theirs back on line until late yesterday morning.  I kept eyeing the hoop house warily and finally strapped on my snow shoes and clomped down to rake it off.  I was lucky, as it wasn't that cold yet and the gate fasteners weren't frozen shut.  I left the gate open.  The poor sheep had the brunt of the tree damage.  There is a huge pine tree bent onto their feeder (it hasn't snapped yet, but....) and the snow is so deep they have a hard time trudging through it.  As I shoveled the quarter mile path to the barn (including a path from barn to their water bucket), I had to practice my non-existent limbo skills more than a few times.  As I wrenched the barn door open....I heard harp music and angels singing.  In front of my dazzled eyes was a wall of hay bales!  My farmer neighbor had come sometime after Saturday's afternoon feed and delivered and stacked my winter hay.  I almost wept.  After the power came back on, I squeezed in a batch of granola - just in case it went out again.  There were also some exciting developments due to our new metal roof - the snow load slowly creeps down and looms over the eaves, complete with deadly-looking icicles, which, as they melt, leave treacherous shallows of ice right outside ones doors.  Very exciting, indeed.  The Pepperoni shot out of the back door, hit the ice, did a mad scramble, went off the deck and into a pile of snow at least three times his height.  We all froze.  Then a small, black nose poked up, followed by a snow-covered face.  He was fine!  Even Lovey was tippy-toeing across the deck after that performance.  And I have been watching Scrappy like a hawk.  He is a bit unsteady on his old pins, and I don't want any falls, sprains, breaks, or other catastrophes to befall my boy.  We spent most of the day in front of the fireplace - the dogs wrapped burrito-style in their blankets, cats curled on beds by the fire and me with my book and knitting.  It wasn't bad at all.  Except for the having-to-go-out-and-shovel-way-too-often part.Monday morning revealed another 10 inches or so of lighter, fluffier snow, so back out I went.  There was no way I could have lived through shoveling my driveway, too, so I had to take the day off.  As is usually the case, over the mountain, in the city, there was no snow.  None.  It is so bizarre.  Thank goodness for camera phones.  Our snowfall even made the news in the Big City.  Woot.  My neighbor showed up with his plow around 3:30 and I felt as if I was out of bondage.  I snow-shoed in from the road to feed the feral cat this morning - she was very happy to see me!I'm taking this as a test-run for my winter preps.  Or lack thereof.  So far, I'd give myself a C.  I did not get the ducks' heated water dish in and it will be a real pain now, with all that snow.  I forgot to put out the bird feeders.  I did not clean the waterers and put them away.  I did remember to shovel to my gate and then from the gate to the feed bin - with snow as deep as we have, you have to shovel more than once.  Waiting to shovel at the end will kill you!  Time to put on my two-alarm fluorescent socks in case I go head-first into a ditch!  I will try to get some shots of the tree damage - now that I have a leg-up, so to speak, on the shoveling part and can use both hands."},

Williams Park﻿Bubble ManBubble Magic!Speaking of magic... While Sylvie and I were chatting away and catching up, Jim disappeared.  That evening, just before we set off for drinks at his daughter's bar, he gave me this:Isn't it lovely?I had admired Sylvie's mom's stool (beautifully tole-worked) and Jim had made a pattern from it.  I said I would like to commission one, thinking that some day - in the future - Sylvie could bring it with her when she came through.  Jim is a man of action.  He cut, fitted, glued, clamped and sanded this little gem so that I could have it before I left!  Amazing.  And it is a lovely, useful thing.  I can't wait to finish it - I have so many ideas... My trip back was uneventful - and faster.  The dogs missed me.  Scrappy, it seems, got very stressed and threw up.  My poor boy.  Good thing he recovers quickly.  I had taken Monday off so that I would have a buffer between vacation and work.  Otherwise, I find, one forgets their vacation almost instantly.  However, the Universe had other plans and I woke up Monday with what I thought was a head cold.  By Monday evening it was a full-blown flu.  Blech.  I was down for the count for a couple of days, although I managed to get outside yesterday (it was 65 DEGREES) and prune the peonies and dahlias, yoink the rest of the tomato and pepper plants, and get some washing on the line.  I also made a loaf of einkorn bread (my favorite recipe - 2 hour, non-dairy) so I could have something to go with the endless bowls of soup.  Lovey decided to down half of it while my back was turned.  There were bad words spoken loudly.  All my attempts to break her of this counter-surfing habit have failed. So back in the saddle today.  I walked into a firestorm and I've been putting out fires all day.  I could use another vacation...."},

{"title": "Just how flexible am I?", "date": "Monday, October 24, 2016", "text": "﻿My little patient.Let's just say that, if my joints were as flexible as my schedule, I could be a yoga master.  After going on four weeks of Juno as a semi-mobile, non-walking/standing patient, I made calls to get an expert opinion.  I talked to the vet at the rabies clinic who was not all that helpful (she's mostly into cows).  I called my new large animal vet who could 'get to me sometime in early November'.  Then, in desperation, I called my favorite (and overworked) vet of all things animals.  And he answered the phone!  At first, it looked like he could not get to us until Wednesday but then found a way to squeeze us in on Saturday.   However, he didn't have the schedule made up and wouldn't know what time until Saturday morning.  So, all things Saturday were put in a holding pattern.  The skies also opened up.  After getting the go-ahead for Saturday early afternoon, I ran down Plan A and revised to Plan B.  This entailed jettisoning the feed run.  I was limited also by the fact that I will be gone for two days next weekend and am handing the whole mess over to my dear sister.  AND my neighbor who continually saves my bacon is on vacation.I did get most of the other chores and errands done - large Goodwill run (I am keeping up with my quota), Tractor Supply run - dog treats and an emergency bag of scratch feed, parents' for lunch and use of their dryer to fluff dry the down garments.  *Note here:  Be sure to thoroughly check your down coats and vests BEFORE washing them in case of cuts and tears.  This is going in my Do As I Say (not as I do) book.*  By the time I left their house (in VT), it was pouring.  I had just enough time to get home and let the dogs out before Dr. D arrived.  Let me just interject here that I love this man.  Not in the romantic sense, but as a person and a vet he is above all others.  Always cheerful.  Extremely empathetic and willing to try anything.  He listens.  He loves animals.  His practice credo is to treat every patient as if it were your own.  That is why I trust his judgment.  We dashed into the barn and he remarked that Juno seemed to have a very strong life force.  That she does.  She got booster shots, vitamin shots and a steroid.  I was told to lay the calories on and roust her about as often as possible.  We would revisit Wednesday.  All day Saturday, I was in and out of the barn (always in the 3+ inches of rain/sleet/snow we got).  I rousted.  I cajoled.  I plied her with second cut hay and sweet feed and molasses drenches.  She got perkier but still did not stand.  I squished when I walked.  To make myself feel as if I was accomplishing something, I baked these:Coconut Flour Chocolate Chip Cookies (From Mighty Nest)﻿﻿(Makes 1 dozen relatively small cookies.  Or so I say...)1/3 cup coconut flour1/4 cup coconut oil, melted1/4 cup maple syrup1 teaspoon vanilla1/4 teaspoon salt2 eggs1/3 cup dark chocolate chipsPreheat oven to 350*.  Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper or a silicone mat.  In a large bowl, whisk flour, melted oil, maple syrup, vanilla, salt, and eggs until the mixture comes together into a thick batter.  It did take a little while for the coconut flour to absorb the liquids.  Fold the chocolate chips into the batter to distribute.   Drop by heaping tablespoon onto the parchment paper.  You have to flatten these slightly, as they will not spread.  Bake for 12-14 minutes, until the edges are golden.  Cool on cookie sheet for 10 minutes and then transfer to cool completely on a rack.  Store leftovers (hahahahaha) in the refrigerator.I felt better, but Juno hadn't changed.  I did a few inside chores (it rained all the day long and all the night long, and added high winds), but not a whole lot was accomplished.  A lot of sock knitting but that doesn't count until you get at least half your list checked off.  So sez me.  I did get the nesting boxes cleaned out and some surfaces scraped off, but nowhere near the 'clean the coop' job I had intended.  Sorry, sis.  On a happy note, both the little hens and the girl ducks put themselves to bed for the night with no help from moi!  Oh, happy day!  All I have to do is go out and close doors.Sunday, the weather finally cleared up, just in time for us to toddle up the mountain to the cookout.  Imagine my shock at seeing four inches of snow halfway up!  It is three miles from my house to the hosts' house and it was like a totally different climate!  I am glad that I put coats on all the kids, as the wind was whipping around, too.  They were very well-behaved and received.  It was two hours of treats, food, runs, walks, and much patting of heads.  By the time I loaded them into the car for the drive back down the mountain, Pepper was snoring in his soup.  They were out for hours, happy dogs.Unfortunately, Juno was not so happy.  With all of the added protein to build her strength up, she had developed bloat by evening.  I put in a call to Dr. D and we discussed the fact that, in her weakened state, there was not much hope.  I would do what I could for her and he would come down on his lunch hour to send her on to her next big adventure.  I gave Juno two bicarbonate of soda drenches between 6 and 11:30, and rolled her around and squeezed her a bit.  She seemed to like the attention and burped a couple of times - all of which I took as hopeful signs.  I brought out my knitting and set up my camp stool, and she and I (I did all of the talking...) spent a few companionable hours.  I recounted her birth (in case she forgot it) and my part in in.  I talked about her mother - Flora - and I knitted.  There is something so right about spending time with a very nice sheep and knitting.  At 11:30, I let the boys and Apria into the barn so that she could have company, and sadly took my knitting off to bed.  This morning, I put off going out to check on her because I didn't want to find her gone.I didn't.  She was back to perky and chewing her cud.  I called the vet to report in and happily rushed around doing morning chores.  I was so happy that I left early so that I could do one of the jobs on my list - take the recycling to the transfer station on my way (sort of) to work.  I had forgotten that they did not open until 9 on Mondays.  Thank goodness I know the crew that works there - they begrudgingly let me do a frantic run-through and get out of their way quickly.Dr. D and I still have to have the hard talk about Juno, but at least I know she is not suffering.  Now, if I could just get my feet and hands warm again..."},

{"title": "And then there were four....", "date": "Friday, October 14, 2016", "text": "The silence was deafening this morning.  Yesterday at o' dark thirty, I wrestled eleven ducks into two large dog crates, loaded them in my car and headed north.  One of the downsides of living in this state is the dearth of processors, thanks to over-regulation.  There was one processor who would handle ducks and they were a good distance north of me, with an early cut-off time for drop-off, to boot.Armed with my trusty GPS, off I went.  An hour and a half later, after going 2.2 miles this way, 3.1 miles that way, 5.6 miles the other way, etc., I was thinking how lucky I was to have my trusty GPS to guide me through this maze of back roads, country lanes, hills and dales.  It guided me all right - right into the back yard of someone who was NOT the processor.   I believe I was within spitting distance of Canada.Frantic now (having all that quacking in the back did not help sooth my nerves), I drove aimlessly, trying to find a signal so I could call them and report my lost-ness.  I went right into their voicemail.  I left a fairly unintelligible message and begged for mercy and an time extension.  I squinted at my phone (having conveniently forgotten to bring my glasses) and typed in the address again.  Bingo!  I was off - in the wrong direction.  By now my blood pressure was rising and the inside of the car was littered with feathery down and wood shavings - having 11 equally frantic and stinky ducks in near proximity means windows down.  I found a sheriff's way station and rang the bell.  No answer, even though there were about six cars in the parking lot.  I briefly contemplated hitting the big, red EMERGENCY HELP button, but then figured they wouldn't agree that being lost with a car full of ducks constituted a legitimate reason for breaking up their coffee klatch/card game and would arrest me for false emergency.  Back in the car, I tried once again to reach the processor - and did!Turns out they were very close to where I had been about 45 minutes ago - about 20 miles away.  By the time I pulled into the drive, I was a mess.  But they were very nice about it and did not refuse to take the ducks (that was the awful thought that kept running in loops through my mind).  We briefly discussed the giant turkeys a farmer had dropped off (we had a bet as to what the processed weight would be - I won.  I was closer to the final 42#) and I took myself off.  Since it was a lovely day and I was close to Vermont, I stopped to pick up my yearly apple supply and headed to my parents' house.  Five cups of tea later, I was finally calm.  I drove back to the processor, loaded the now-quiet ducks into the cooler and headed home.  I also gleaned a happy nugget of news - this guy was merely renting the facilities until he put a processing unit into his own farm - a mere half hour from me!  Woot!I straggled inside, squeezed the ducks into the freezer, let the dogs out and poured a glass of wine (not necessarily in that order).  The four girls left were very quiet - I imagine they decided to keep a low profile, just in case...  After a little carrying-on this morning, they settled down and seemed to enjoy the fact that they could forage and splash without being assaulted every five minutes.  I am enjoying the quiet until they re-find their voices."},

She and I have been battling parasites since early spring - she's older and does not have a lot of resistance under the best circumstances.  Saturday morning she was down - but bright-eyed and with an appetite.  As things stand now, she is still bright-eyed, eating everything but not able to stand.  I had been moving her legs and trying to get her up every few hours, but now, stuck in my damn office, I cannot do anything but worry and think about it.  I am afraid that she will not be able to stand again if she goes on like this much longer, and then yet another tough decision must be made.Over this weekend Hopalong, the lame duck, lost the good fight.  She was a tough little thing, but she was too lame to sustain herself and got weaker and weaker.  I had to help her along to her next big life.  It's a tough way to downsize.Saturday and Sunday nights the temperatures plummeted to the freezing/frost point and I had a mad scramble to get the avocado and lemon trees inside, and then did a sweep through the basil.  Other than a cover on the geraniums, everything else was on its own.  Next weekend is plant-the-garlic-and-shallots time, and yoink the tomato plants.  The kale is amazing this year - thank goodness for that.Aromatic Bouquet in a Bucket There goes my dining room.I am trying not to bake for the sake of baking - I am a baking fool.  I LOVE to bake.  However, I am a family of one human and nothing I bake is a single serving.  I think I have found the solution.  I may also have three dirigibles on legs in the house.Dog BicuitsNote here - Am I the last person on Earth to realize that you can make little treat blobs and not spend hours rolling out and cutting individual little neat, square treats?  Save me from myself!"},

{"title": "The Velvet Tacquito", "date": "Tuesday, August 23, 2016", "text": "Saturday was a heady mix of all things 'duck', setting up the electronet for the sheep and tending to some much-ignored domestic tasks.  As I surveyed the groundhog-sized dust bunnies, nose-smeared windows, dust-covered surfaces, debris-covered floor mats, and piles o' stuff, I realized just how far I've fallen down the Good Housekeeping scale.  I really must get more organized.  Really.  I did as much as I could before cleaning myself up (a whole nuther subject) and motoring off to meet with my middle sis, BIL, mother and father, to celebrate Dad's 94th birthday.  It's always an experience to go out with my father.  It reinforces how completely thankful I am that my sister is the one taking care of them.  She has the patience of Job.Sunday, I spent a fun-filled morning doing more domestic chores, then motored off to run all my errands with The Pepperoni in tow.  He was scheduled for a spa session with his favorite groomer.First, we dropped off recycling at the transfer station - where he poked his little head out of the window all the better to receive oohs and aahs and the accompanying head pats - then we had a nice visit with my friend, Marianne, and her granddog, Henry - a French Bulldog puppy.  Henry, as adorable as he is, is very mouthy and was a bit much for TP and my sandals.  While TP was being pampered by Casey, our very favorite groomer, I ran six errands: pet store for litter; grocery store #1 for cat/dog food (on sale and coupon); grocery store #2 for $.99/# chicken for Scrappy's food and chicken bread; filled gas tank; Home Debt for screws for roof; grocery store #3 for $1.89/# ground beef for more Mr. Honey-Bunny food; then back to the groomer.   He now collects lint.  All over.Not the best picture (he is not a cooperator) but he got a buzz-cut and is now the texture of a velvet tacquito with a plumey tail.  He is enjoying the extra attention garnered by the fact that I can't keep my hands off of him... :) The beautiful shades of Summer.I am starting to get tomatoes and was gifted some lovely beets, cucumbers, zucchinis, yellow tomatoes, and beautiful red carrots.  (Don't you love that smiley sponge?)  I had better get hopping with my processing and preserving!By the time TP and I got home, I was wiped out.  I usually do all my errands on Saturday so that I have a day to recover - and do all the other stuff.  It didn't work out that way this past weekend, so I just had to be satisfied (ha) with what I was able to accomplish.  I did get two gates made for the never-ending duck project.  This has made my rather complicated system of moving ducks in, out and around easier.  I am also working on acclimating the pullets so that they can be integrated into the big coop.  I will have to get some pics of the Salmon Faverolles.  They are such interesting-looking chickens - sort of like owlets.  This is working out, most of the time.  I figured it was at least a way for them to have a fighting chance at having access to water during the day - living with the KY Babes means that every available water source is empty within a half hour.  Last night, however, there was a blip.  I had gotten invited to go out for wings and mojitos by a group of women that I really like.  Problem is - and always is - that they are all retired and I am not.  I figured I could spend one hour.  Well, not surprisingly, it was so much fun I spent two hours and didn't make it home until it was pretty dark.  I had to search around for the poor pullets - Bunny, the bantam rooster, and his fav girl had made it over the fence and into their coop.  The rest of them were huddled here and there and had to be scooped up and hand-delivered.  Then the KY Babes had accidently shut the door to their home before they were in, so they were out and hysterical.  Then the Anconas were out and it was all alien now because it was different - as in, dark.  It took forever to get them all shut in for the night.  So much for socializing.And on that note...one of the women said to me as I was hustling away from the table, \"Oh, that's right - you poor thing - you have no life!\"  Wha?  Au contrare!  I have the life I love!  I felt rather smug, as they were all sitting around mitching and boaning (as Mama Pea would say) about their husbands, the time on their hands, blah, blah, blah.  Pfft.  An hour later, I was feeling a tad less smug after charging about in the dark after ducks and pullets."},

{"title": "Two out of three ain't bad.", "date": "Monday, August 8, 2016", "text": "Well, it certainly wasn't a boring weekend.   I'd give it an 8 on a scale of 1 to 10 - one being *snore* and ten being *AAAIIIIIRRRGH!*  I will admit to having a V&T for medicinal reasons last night.  My nerves, you know.I tried three new recipes - two were amazing and one was downright awful.   Friday night, I made a pizza.  With a sweet potato crust.  What the..? you say?  It was m.a.r.v.e.l.o.u.s.  And the half inch of melted cheese on top was totally offset by the nutritious crust.  Really.  I'm sure that's written down somewhere.  I would be sharing a pic of this marvelous invention, but I et it all up.  In my defense, it was not a large pizza.  Next out of the kitchen - while I was on the sweet potato kick - were healthy creamsicles.  The \"healthy\" should have flashed red warning lights but I chose to ignore the alarm bells in my head and carried on.  They were, in a word, gawdawful.  Three ingredients - whole coconut milk, sweet potato, oranges.  Pateeeuwwwi.  I'm not even going to link to the recipe so that I can protect your taste buds.  You're welcome.Lastly, as my weekend ran down into Sunday evening, I made a fresh corn and zucchini pie.  OMG.  Even with an 'oops' (as in when will I learn that I NEED to wear my glasses), it was awesome-sauce.It took a great deal of willpower to stop eating this.Mine was sort of a rectangular pie, as I was too tired to dig out my pie plate from the back of the bottom cupboard.  Easy clean-up when you line it with parchment paper!Lots of berries at the top!Saturday morning, it poured rain.  This did not bode well for my planned birthday blueberry picking with my sister.  However, the clouds parted and the day progressed into a bright, sunny day.  It was so bright and sunny that my sister and I took to hiding from it in the bushes.  I picked under my all-time best of 15#, but did get an admirable 11#.  Then, Sunday morning, I was up at the top of our plateau picking more!  Another beautiful morning with only birdsong, breezes and the occasional car.  It was a beautiful way to start the day.  Had I known what lay ahead, I would have hidden in the bushes until the snow fell.A nice way to spend a morningI made up for (and exceeded) my personal best.  Total for two days:  20#.  I am set for winter.The light at the end of the tunnel.Not being satisfied with having to freeze 20# of blueberries, I picked up a bag of (supposedly) 55 ears of sweet corn.  Sunday was filled with shucking and de-cobbing, bagging and freezing.  I was disappointed in the corn, though.  It was from a farm stand known for their wonderful corn - however, there were only 53 ears in the bag and there was a LOT of worm damage.  A message to the farm did not bring satisfactory answers.  Still, I am set for a couple of years.  I only do corn every other year.Heaps o' corn!There was also work in the garden - garlic, shallots and a few onions were pulled and put in the barn to cure.  The garlic was fair-to-good.  The only disappointing heads were due to the lack of rain and idiocy of the gardener.  She neglected to cut off all the scapes.  Shallots and onions were also small, due to the dry weather.  A lot of weeding was done.  Floors were washed.  And washed again. Because Scrappy (Mr. Pee Me A River) seems to be struggling with some incontinence.  This is a dog that doesn't just pee a puddle - OH no.  He must move through ROOMs peeing.  Given his age - 16, and the fact that he rarely commits this faux pas, I started thinking diabetes.  He has been drinking a lot of water.  Of course, it's also summer and a hot, dry one at that, so it's hard to tell.  Then, this morning, as I velcroed on the Cummerbund of Shame, a dim light bulb flickered.  I had been feeding them a raw diet, but it was too expensive to continue with three dogs.  I had switched them back to kibble and I think that might be the culprit.  It's a high-end ($$$) food and I supplement it with eggs and broth, but it might be affecting my old boy.  I'm going to ease him back into a raw diet and see if that makes a difference. Just so I could start my Monday off in style, there was Duck Drama.  I have, as you may know, if you're following the lunacy, sixteen ducks in three different age groups.  The Anconas (large, white with black markings, rare breed) are the oldest; the Cayugas (black from head to flappy foot) are the middles; and the Cayuga/Blue Swedish Crosses (or KY Babes) are the youngest.  The KY Babes include a little fellow with a club foot.  I did not, as Good Goose Mama Pea did, catch the deformity and put a little brace on when it was young.  It gets along okay, but it is obviously challenged.  One of the others seems to have 'Angel Wings' - a deformity wherein the wings stick out at a 45-degree angle.  Trying to make a long story short (ha), today I decided that they have all seen each other and everything seems to be copacetic, so I would let the Babes out to enjoy the yard and the little pool.  I am on the other side of the fence doing something or other, when I hear frantic peeping and lots of noise.  I hot-footed it through the gate and found all four of the Anconas on top of little Hopalong, pecking it~!  It seems the Anconas will continue to be a rare breed, as the four I have are now moved to the top of the processing list.  The Cayugas do not bother them at all and have intermixed with the Babes with no signs of violence or aggression.  The Babes got the safety and room of both runs today and I will have to come up with a Plan X to make sure they get space and get it safely. I was glad to get to the office where the only violence occurs over the last cup of Dark Magic coffee."},

{"title": "Everyone into the pool!", "date": "Monday, June 13, 2016", "text": "My weekend started at 6A by packing the Nuggets into their travel crates.  This was done under an ominously slate-gray sky.  My friend, M, bravely volunteered to transport them to Base Nuggets (my neighbor's), where my 80+ year-old helpers awaited.  Sigh.  At many points, I was reminded of what it must feel like to herd cats.  While I appreciated their cheerful presence and enthusiastic attitude, there was a lot of redirecting, clarifying and more redirecting.  I finally took charge (I was born to take charge - just ask my poor sisters) and took matters in hand.  That did streamline the process a bit.  About one third of the way through the process, the skies opened and it poured.  With some fast-thinking (not mine...I was trying to keep the 'help' focused) a canopy was erected and we proceeded through all 28 birds.  I could not have done it without them - as slow and sort of scattered as they may have been, they never complained and never stopped.  I was also very thankful for the loan of the plucker (I so 'heart' it).   It continued to rain in buckets and at some point you reach a saturation level that give you a devil-may-care attitude about walking around outside getting things done.  We sent the oldest of our team home with her Nuggets and my neighbor and I cleaned up the equipment, put things away and sorted out our Nuggets for an hour in driving rain.  When I finally walked through the front door - after a thorough Nose Scan by the dogs - I headed for a hot shower, dry clothes and wool socks!  ﻿﻿﻿I \"heart\" this thing.The skies cleared later that afternoon and the sun came out briefly - but I was too knackered to do much else.  I slogged around outside and found this:﻿ I \"heart\" this thing, too.And spent way too long watching this:The only ones enjoying the weather.Sunday, I finished my garden under blustery, cold, damp skies - although I think I may have to replant the kale and chard, as the rains we have been getting are more like monsoons and I think my seeds may have gotten washed away.  The final raised bed was weeded, carrots are in (I swear this is my LAST try at growing carrots), a replanting of yellow beans went in, potatoes were hilled, strawberry flowers were plucked off.  Then I trooped inside and dealt with the Nuggets.  I have 15 whole, half, and parted birds in the freezer.  Some are going to my sister and parents and some will be used for bartering.The chicklets were moved into the small coop and the laundry room-cum-brooder central was cleaned and readied for the Cayuga ducklings that I picked up Sunday morning.  After all, why let things get boring when you can complicate your life even more?  I am way behind on my purging - I was thinking that, just last year I would get days behind, while this year those days have turned into weeks.  Another snag is that I have not been able to get to Goodwill, so I have a backlog that needs to go out the door before I add too much more to the pile.  However, I am determined to get things flowing again by the end of this coming weekend.  Heaven help me.﻿﻿﻿﻿"},

Pulse until smooth. With the motor running, slowly pour in the oil.  If you are not in a hurry (as I always seem to be), adding the oil in a tiny, slow stream will create a lovely pink creamy emulsified dressing.  Mine is not - creamy and emulsified, that is - but it is perfectly fine as it is.  This is now my favorite springtime dressing! And the beauty of it, is that I now have a new purpose for freezing my rhubarb - I think this would be very nice on one of my winter chopped salads!"},

I don't have pictures because I immediately ate six after opening the box and had to put them in the freezer out of self-defense.  They are wonderful!  Not only were there two big bags of wonderful sauerkraut balls, but as part of the freezer 'paks' used in shipping, he included a frozen container of his homemade chicken souvlaki!The Universe may have it in for me, but I am holding my own with the help of my wonderful friends.P.S.  I know I am behind in the purge lists, but will catch up this week - pinkie promise!"},

Sunday started at 7:30a and ended at 5:30p.  I made sure I had a lumberjack breakfast because there was going to be no lunch break.  I got the ducklings outside for their second time.  They are getting so big!  Then I started to work on the hoop house so that I could move the nuggets out of the two brooders.  This involved re-tarping it, cleaning it out (note to self: next time, don't wait a year), running electric (frost predicted) for a heat lamp, hanging feeders, finding and cleaning the big waterer and last, but not least, transporting all 30 of the fat buggers.  This was comprised of plopping a bunch of them into a box with handles, walking across the chicken yard, up-over-down the deck, across the back, through two gates and into the hoop house.  I repeated this process seven times.  I also discovered one dirty, sad, beaten down Nugget.  He/she had been smooshed, pushed and rolled in poop.  Sigh.  After I had gotten the rest in their last home, I put up the electronet and charger and focused on my patient.  I gave it a warm bath and a blow-dry.  Then I set up a little brooder in the - let's say it together: LAUNDRY ROOM (which, please note, saw no laundry done this weekend) - and let it recover.  It is a sorry thing and I don't know if it will fully recover.  But, it's warm, clean, dry and is eating and drinking.  I let the sheeples out into the back paddock for grass and managed to feed the dogs before 6P.  Not quite before the ... snow ... began.In between, my sister and mother stopped by for her beef share.  I would usually be horrified for my mother to witness the state my house was in.  This time?  Didn't care.  I also lost a hen in a very mysterious way.  When I got back from the police station, my neighbors were hiking by and wanted eggs (and to see the ducklings), so we went into the chicken yard.  There, dead center (pardon the pun) was one of my Welsomers, neck broken, one foot pointing skyward.  There was no visible cause of death, but it looked to be violent.  She was not an old hen.  It was a shame.  (And very traumatic, apparently, for my neighbors.)  Let's hope they do not sue me."},

{"title": "Practical Things and Aimless Ramblings.", "date": "Thursday, April 14, 2016", "text": "I was thinking of how glad I am that I am able to create practical things.  If I need a new dishcloth, I knit one.  Ditto with dish and hand towels.  It takes a little (okay, a LOT) longer to create a pair of socks, but I can do it.  For the most part, I can make what I need.  The only drawback - if it is, indeed, a drawback - is that I cannot create something practical in five minutes. Lunch knitting project.This got me thinking about how thoroughly instant gratification has permeated our lives.  At work, the sender of an email expects to hear back from you in a nanosecond and gets their undies in a bunch if it doesn't happen, no matter how unimportant that answer is.  Planning ahead takes a backseat to 'don't worry, we can get it at Wal-Mart at 8A on Sunday if we need it.'  Forget to take something out of the freezer (say, that WM frozen high-fat, high-sodium family-of-twelve-size pizza)?, nuke it.  Most of us (present company - yousguys - excluded) have forgotten how to take basic care of ourselves and provide for our needs with our two little hands.  No wonder so many people are angry.  Anger is most often fear-based and I would bet that most of those who are angry have gotten themselves to the point where they must rely on others (government) to provide for their basic needs.  If that doesn't put the fear of God into you, I don't know what will.  It seems that common sense has left the building.  I am surrounded every day by people who feel that they are entitled to everything just because they exist.  Coming into or out of the city every day, there is a fellow who plants himself at a rather inconvenient traffic light.  He holds a sign that states he is a veteran of the Navy, homeless and would appreciate some help.  It is an inconvenient light because there are three lanes of traffic, jam-packed with drivers who are chomping at the bit to rocket off as soon as the light turns green.  This fellow used to stand, smoking away, which made me think that - if he would stop smoking, he could save quite a bit of money right there - while at the same time, what business was it of mine that he smoked anyway?  I had a few brief conversations with him while I idled at the light and mentioned that his smoking might be putting a crimp in his donations.  He smiled and agreed.  I didn't see him for a few weeks and then I saw him this morning.  Sans cigarette.  He smiled when he saw me and shouted - \"I quit!\"  I gave him five bucks.Ending this string of aimless wanderings, I will leave you with a snapshot of my morning.  Frantic knitting until 6 - change to barn clothes and feed the pups and kitties.  Out the door to the farm.  When I pull up at the barn in the morning, the calves start bawling.  It is so loud, you can hear it outside with the doors and windows shut.  When I stagger in with the first two pails of milk, the farmer is very happy to see me, as the noise level dims slightly and continues to do so with each double feeding until I have finished feeding Monkey and Tulip, the last of the eight.  I have given them all names, which the farmer finds very entertaining:  Daisy (my girl), PIA (do you need a translation?), Pixie, Dinkle, Monkey (as in Chunky Monkey), Tulip, Legs, Butthead.  I then toddle down the aisle and say hello to Jasmine and sneak her more grain (of which the farmer is quite aware), then out to the car with a quick stop to feed various feral barn cats at the old farmhouse (the farmer insists on putting down rat bait, even though I have pointed out on numerous occasions that it is either bait or barn cats).  I refuse to feed them at the barn, because I don't want them tempted by poisoned rodents.  Sigh.  Then back home to do my own outside chores.  Then a quick (sometimes too quick, if the sight of my hair in the office mirror is any indication) transformation into working girl and off I go.  It was a little more difficult to leave this morning because the birds were singing and there was a bright spring sun glinting through the trees, giving me the feeling that maybe, just maybe, spring is back for good."},

{"title": "On the ball or under it?", "date": "Wednesday, January 27, 2016", "text": "Since there seems to be a rather large lull in winter right now (JINXED), I quit procrastinating and dragged out my garden planning accessories this past weekend.  Those being:  binder, graph paper, mechanical pencil, seed catalogs, seed packets, notebook.  I cleared off the dining room table (except for my centerpiece - above - which I use for inspiration), made a pot of tea and took my seat.  Then I got up, gave the dogs crunchy treats, meandered about for a half hour, and forced myself back into my chair.  Hello Brain!?!  Hello!?!  Every year, I promise myself that I will not buy one more seed packet, as I have TONS of seeds that still have life in them.  And it's not like I am planting for a family of six.  Nevertheless, I take my garden very seriously, as it provides all of my fresh produce and most of my preserved (canned/dried/ frozen) for the year.  Last year, for some reason, I never sat down with paper and pencil and plotted the garden.  It was a big mistake.  Everything went in rather willy-nilly and it showed.  Sweet peas planted on the bean trellis were engulfed and stunted.  Cukes were put in a hard to reach place and were the cause of much...colorful language.  Beans were disorderly.  Peppers were puny.  Tomatoes fell down.  Basil was squeezed out.  It was a mess.  Because there was no order, it was difficult to keep track of what did well and why.New last year were tomatillos.  They grew like crazy and produced tons of fruit.  I think I got a half bushel from two plants.  However, other than the rather exotic thought of tomatillos, I did not care for them as much as I thought I would, so they are off the list for this year.  New this year are leeks.  In my quest for a passable carrot crop (2016 or Bust!),  I have decided to dedicate one bed to carrots and leeks (because they are best friends).  I am going to dig in a pile o' sand into that bed, add a pile o' llama beans and hope for the best.  This will include actually thinning the seedlings - rather than thinking about it.  I am weak.Last year's potato crop was very uneven.  The fingerlings were disappointing, while the Red Norlands were the size of large Russets, but there were few.  I've ordered potatoes from a new source this year - The Maine Potato Lady - in the hopes that I will find a good, organic seed potato that will produce.  I grow my taters in tater bags and in tires, which seems to work well.  Usually.  The chipmunks (buggers) made harvesting my strawberry crop almost impossible.  In order to be able to out maneuver them in order to get to the ripe berries before they did, I had to resort to putting bird netting over the entire bed.  This made picking them a real pain.  I ended up ripping holes in the top so that I could reach most of them without having to remove the covering each time and replacing it and pinning it down.  Needless to say, the weeds thought this was marvelous and overtook the entire bed.  I had to rip out the plants (most of which were on the old side, truth be told) and will replant this spring.  The Chipmunkinator is coming out early.Beans.  Well, those purple pod pole beans were superhuman - or superbeanan!  I have so many seeds from these beans that I will gladly send seeds to whomever wants a hugely healthy, thriving pole bean.  Just send me an email with your mailing address.   Seriously.  I have two quart jars full of seeds.  I am going to plant whatever is in my seed stock this year - some are a little dated, but since I only need a few plants of each, I am sure there is enough viable seed stock to set me up.  My goal at the end of this new gardening season (may it be the best yet for everyone!) is to end up with enough of my own seeds that I do not have to buy anything but seed potatoes and onions next year.  This may mean that no seed catalogues can enter the house.  I am, as I said, weak."},

The BUCKET!  This has complicated my already complicated morning.  Starting January 4, I have new hours, thanks to the Merger From Hell (MFH).  I have to go in earlier, which means ratcheting up my morning game.  I already get up at 4A, which allows me some quiet time to knit and read my daily journal entry on my path to enlightenment (right Mama Pea?)  This also means the doglets are getting breakfast at 6 (no complaints heard so far), then to the farm, then back for my own breakfast, then out to do chickens and sheep, then back in to do a superfast shower, flash dry, reasonable facsimile of work clothes, then out the door for my hour's commute.  This seems to work, although there is no room for glitches.  And you know there are always glitches.This morning I walked into the barn to find the farmer with his hair on end and an armful of tools.  The water system that waters the cows was not working on a quarter of the barn, so 15 cows were not getting water.  Plus it was the morning the milk truck was coming.  I put myself in overdrive and fed all the calves (saving Daisy for last because, well, she's as sharp as a marble).  Then I grabbed two 5 gallon buckets and watered all the cows in the dry zone (motivated because my dear Jazzie is in that section).  Then I rocketed home, snorted down my oatmeal, threw feed at everyone outside and made it in to find...I had no time to shower.Since there is definitely a slight but noticeable Eau de Cow Barn about me, I am keeping a low profile.  TGIF."},

That would make quite a difference to my budget.  Then he stores the hay in his barn and helps us load when we need it.  Unfortunately, my neighbor with the trailer has only one speed.  Slow to the point of reverse.  Four and a half hours later, we were wrapping tarps around the hay in his trailer because it was getting dark and said ice storm was coming.  FOUR AND A HALF hours to move 106 bales.  I think the actual loading took a half hour.  The rest of the time was spent in painful ponderous-ness strapping and quadruple strapping the hay to the trailer.  Needless to say, nothing else got done, other than feeding all the furries.  I also discovered, mid-hay-loading, that I had forgotten to remove the egg-of-the-day out of my down vest pocket.  Plus, the weather plummeted from spring-like to raw and frigid and I got so cold it took me hours to warm up.  I had barely enough time to change clothes again and scuttle over to another neighbor's holiday party, where I mumbled a few words, tossed back a glass of wine, ate as many bacon-wrapped scallops as I could grab, and left.  I am not exactly a shining example of the perfect party guest.Now I am all about my New Year's Resolutions.  I usually am all humbuggy about resolutions, but I think I need to take myself to task this coming year.  If one more wheel falls of this cart, I might as well call it a sled and downhill we will go.  The biggest problem is keeping the list to under 20 resolutions!"},

{"title": "One foot outside my comfort zone.", "date": "Tuesday, June 23, 2015", "text": "Since the critters on the LLF are in destructo mode, I have been placed outside of my comfort zone more than a few times.  There are many things that I willingly throw myself into, but car repair and anything electronic are two areas I dasn't go.  Until now.  While I do not (and will not) learn to repair my car, I am a hands-down expert at picking up on a worn wheel bearing.  I can tell you through nuanced grindings, about how long you have before you must get thee to the mechanic or else.As I stared at, then tried to ignore my broken fence charger placed strategically upon the dining room table (where I could not totally ignore it), I toyed with just replacing it with a new one - until I looked up the price.  Then, again, aren't I the one all preachy about fixing rather than throwing out - throwing 'away' to the non-away?  Yes, I am.Over the weekend, I took a deep breath and decided to fix the charger myself.  Frankly, it took longer to find the right tools than to actually fix it.  After I parted it from its back board, I searched around the perimeter and located four teeny-tiny screws that looked like they needed a hex key the size of a darning needle.  Dang.  I have two sets of hex keys, but none were small enough.  I ignored it again for a day, then rummaged through my junk drawer and came up with a teeny-tiny screw driver.  While I was leery about how useful it would be, I also put on my reading glasses to take a look at the screws.  Hi ho.  There were little screwdriver grooves in it.  Honestly, sometimes I am my own worst enemy.The cable on the right had beenyoinked out by the bad sheep.Close up of the circuit board andwhite oblong thingy.  I knew you just HADto see it.I got the cover off and carefully put the screws in an empty spice jar, screwing on the lid tightly.  The cats have been particularly horrid lately.  I fed the cable back through the side and located the two connections I thought were right.  But wait.  There was no + or -.  No sign of positive or negative.  Dang squared.  Since one connection was to the circuit board, and one went to an oblong white thingy (technical term), how was one to tell what was positive or negative?  I figured (technically speaking) that the positive should go to the circuit board since that seemed to be the business end of the process and the ground should go to the white thingy.  I connected them, walked it over to my kitchen island, cleared the deck, stood a respectful distance from the charger, plugged it in and ran.  Woot!  It did NOT blow up, it worked!  I gingerly unplugged it and replaced the cover and backboard.  Then I hotfooted it outside and mounted it on the pole and plugged it in (from a respectful distance - I do not trust electronics that I work on).  It still worked!  Yes!I will move the reprobates to the slope once I have the time to stay and watch them.  I need to nip this destructo stuff in the bud, if at all possible.  In the meantime, I had inherited a battery-run charger that was in need of new connectors and a new battery.  That was pretty straightforward.  I now have a charged Nugget run (wasn't Norman surprised....) and the sheep will be able to 'free' graze soon.  I have been eyeing the ceiling fan in my bedroom.  It hasn't worked since I moved in.  Hey - how hard can it be?  Snort."},
{"title": "This is only a test.", "date": "Monday, June 15, 2015", "text": "Living alone amongst throngs of dogs and cats has developed in me a certain amount of eccentricity.  Okay - quite a bit.  One of those odd bits is that I am constantly talking to objects, both inanimate and live.  Some snippets of conversation (monologue) from the weekend:\"Here comes Moses!  Part the sea!\"  Said while trying to navigate the kitchen with said throngs milling about my ankles and knees, depending on height.\"This is only a test.  This is only a test.\"  Said while standing in front of my washing machine which, two thirds of the way through the week's laundry, stopped.  Completely.  Dead silence, not even a hum.\"Stupid sheep!\"  Said quite a few times over the weekend.  This was repeated many times in succession when I discovered that they had ripped the power cable out of the charger, which will force me to do electrical things - things I am not suited for or any good at.  (See \"This is only a test\" above).Saturday started off delayed.  I got up at my usual 4 AM and it seemed like a normal morning.  Then I glanced out of the window to find Juno standing in the front yard, facing off with the neighbor's Angus bull.  Le sigh.  Muck shoes on and out the front door I flew, screaming like a banshee.  It had the desired effect - Juno twirled in mid-air and headed south.  Angus bull didn't exactly twirl, but he moved pretty quickly for a solid block of beef and trotted off toward home.  I still can't find how Juno got out, but she was very happy to get back in with her sane sheepmates.Then I got involved in a rather sticky crossword puzzle and when I looked at the clock, I was behind.  And I stayed that way all day.  I headed north to the library to pick up three books, two on CD, then headed to M's farm to borrow a battery powered charger (that was BEFORE the \"Stupid sheep\"), then breakfast with sister, BIL and parents, then quick trip to Tractor Supply for another feeder (Note:  when a feeder states that it feeds up to 20 birds, they ain't talking Nuggets), then back home to do chores, take a shower and appear presentable.  Some friends took me and another of their friends out to dinner at a swishy place as a thank you - to me for finding a good home for their goats, to their other friend for driving them to/from hospitals, doctors appointments, etc.  It was such a fun evening!  Much wonderful food and laughter.Sunday was another fast day out of the starting gate.  A neighbor came over with his trailer and we moved my littlest coop up to my helper's place.  Then picked her up and she finished cleaning out the run-in shed while I attacked my laundry and garden.  We had a little time between when she finished and when I was due to take her home, so she helped me \"hill\" my potato bags.  I then stopped at another neighbor who gave me four squash plants and five perennials  (which I needed like another hole in my head, but couldn't help myself), then I worked like a slave in my garden.  A little voice in the back of my head (the voice of reason, which is frequently squelched by the MUCH louder voice of unreason) kept trying to butt in, going on and on about my prescription vis a vis sunlight.  I did finally stagger into the house and stay there until I wasn't staggering.  It was then that I looked out and saw that the sheep were out.  And Linden was staggering, too.  Of my three sheep, Linden is my problem child.  He has trouble with his feet.  He squirms under fences.  He doesn't have the sense that goD gave a turnip.  While the llama, Juno and Norman will head for the shade, Linden has a one-track mind.  Green things.  I managed to get them all into the fence, then guided Linden into the shade.  He laid on the ground, panting.  Those of you with sheep know that they do not pant.  I ran into the house and soaked towels in cold water, then raced outside again.  I wrapped his legs in cold, wet towels and tied another round his neck.  I squirted cool water down his gullet.  I fanned him.  I promised him all kinds of things if he would not succumb.  He didn't.  Thank goodness sheep don't speak human.  I slowly managed to get him up and moving and we all sauntered back to the barn.  Where they stayed the rest of the afternoon.  I went and checked on the nuggets, who were warm but fine.  Except for one.  And now there are 22.I am happy to say that my garden is 99% done.  There are a few things to be done - mostly in the herb garden and finding places for the perennials - but the main garden is planted.  I then harvested lettuce and rhubarb, went inside and made butter, roasted the last of last year's nuggets, and made myself a large G&T, light on the G and heavy on the T.  After being 'braced' thusly, I went into the laundry room and tackled the washer.  The fuse had been tripped off and would not snap back in place.  I decided to give it the only reasonable treatment I could think of.  I ignored it and walked away.  (I am happy to report that it snapped back into place this morning.)  The broken charger is on the dining room table, awaiting some magic that I don't possess."},

{"title": "All righty, then.", "date": "Wednesday, June 3, 2015", "text": "Dexter went off to his new home last night - I have a good feeling about it.  There is always a lot of angst (should have been my middle name - \"Aunt Angst\") when one is handing off a living, breathing charge into some stranger's hands.  But the guy was cooing over him, so I take that as a good sign.  We had to load the 'little' guy into the fellow's van (hoo-ha, glad I wasn't driving over the mountain with that cargo) and he thought he would just pick him up.  I suggested he not do that, but, apparently having to be all manly about it, he dove right in.  I stood back and waited.  Moments later, we both lifted Dex into the back.  I thought he was walking a bit gingerly afterwards.  When I offered to go get the 35# remaining pounds of milk replacer, he didn't argue.  Dex made it safely to his new home, which has an actual barn and many grass-filled paddocks.  He will be a happy camper.  Apria, who has been guarding the sheep against the Alien for weeks, was also a happy camper.In other LLF news, I finally succumbed to Lyme's - I knew it was just a matter of time.  I check myself diligently but, being one person and not double-jointed, I am bound to miss spots.  And ticks.  After ignoring the signs for a couple of weeks, the bulls eye appeared and I reluctantly dragged myself into the doctor's office.  Pfft.  Scrappy and I now have yet another thing in common.  I am reading Laura Ingalls Wilder's autobiography, \"Pioneer Girl\".  It was worth the months-long wait, let me tell you.  What an amazing piece of research this book is.  Trouble with that is, I cannot put it down once I start.  And we are talking hefty tome here.  As much as I loved (and still love) the children's series of Little House on the Prairie books, this is downright fascinating.  Since the annotations are copious and I have limited focus, I am going to have to read it twice - once, straight through without reading the annotations, and twice to read it with the annotations.  Have I mentioned it was fascinating?In amongst the doctor appointment, work, calf wrangling and other chores, I have been planting here and there.  I got the basil in, along with replanting the coldframe with radishes, hoping that whatever evil rodent ate my spinach will choke on the spicy radishes.  One must always hope.  I also put in two echinaceas.  I have not yet put in my onions, chard and beets.  Those are slated for Sunday.  I am going to take advantage of my 'helper' and will rebuild the frame around the herb bed and get that in place.  I am way behind getting my herbs in.  Then there is potting up some hops vines, moving my volunteer sunflowers and getting the electronet up and running.  So far, knock on wood, the Nuggets have settled nicely into the hoop house.  With the plastic film on the front, it is surprisingly warm and snug.  I vented it in the front, as the Nuggets give off an alarming amount of heat - must be all that waddling and eating.  I am going to call the processor this week and make an appointment to take them in the early part of July.  I was hoping to go earlier, but work keeps raising its ugly head and interfering with the better part of my life.  Nerts.I will only have a half-weekend again, as my neighbor's granddaughter is getting married at his place and I must go.  But Sunday is supposed to be a milder, sunnier day - just perfect for garden-working, poop shoveling and general mischief.  Maybe I'll even have pictures!"},

Doing chores and trying to get the giant Chocolate Lab (aka Dexter) out for some exercise.  It's like an actual rodeo - without the skilled cowgirl.  The way it works is like this:I reach over the walls of his stall and try to catch his collar.  Meanwhile, his hard, hard BIG noggin is weaving and bobbing because he is excited!  After narrowly missing dislocating my shoulder, I snag the D ring and clip on his lead.  Then I unlatch the gate and.... WHEE HAW.  We both get our cardiovascular exercise.  I have had the foresight to move llama and sheep to a safe distance with two gates in between.  Once he gets the initial hysteria out of his system, I unhook the lead and let him run around for a while.  Then I sneak around and get his bucket ready.  He knows his name and when he hears me call, it means breakfast/dinner.  He races in the barn and into his stall and sinks his head up to his ears in his bucket.  While the Hoover vacuums up the milk replacer, I gingerly set the bucket down and then race to the back and re-hook the gate to his stall.  He finishes and pounds the bucket around, bucks and carries on, then settles down for his little scoop of grain.  Then his little mound of highly-expensive, difficult to come by third-cutting hay.  Yes, the little prince will only eat this hay.  While he's coming along, my huge backlog of chores and projects make this process less than ideal, but the only option for some time.  I have decided to sell him.Speaking of backlog of projects, I decided to cave in and farm out (so to speak) the cleaning of the run in shed - the sheepies' and llama's summer quarters.  So I can add clean up of barn and paddocks to my list right after I cross off 'clean the run in shed' - vicious circle, no?  I have asked every able bodied teenager of the male persuasion that I or anyone I know, knows.  The result?  A lot of whining.  Geezloueeze.  I went on Facebook and asked locally - and I am paying $10 an hour, for Nat's sake.  The only response I got was from a woman.  I have great trepidation for the future of this country.This youngish woman is an elder care giver who's last patient passed away, leaving her with lots of time on her hands.  I like her - she is just getting into chickens and loves them - but there are issues.  She doesn't drive.  (WHAT?  Why in God's name would you move yourself into the middle of rural nowhere with no means of getting around?  She is married with a 9 y/o son.  I am flabbergasted.)  She, son and Hubby came out yesterday in the rain to see the chickens.  It was then I was informed that, should I need her to work for me, Hubby would have to drive her and would drop her and Son off.  This child, interesting as he is, was into everything he could get his hands on within three seconds of landing on my driveway.  I volunteered to pick her up.  Alone.And, on the subject of children - of which I am no expert whatsoever, being totally an observer of other people's children - what is with the \"I want\", \"I want\" thing?  He wanted my rooster, two of my chickens, the llama, with a stamp of his 9 y/o foot after every demand.  Good grief.  The Hubby followed behind, murmuring, \"he's so smart, he knows ALL about animals and plants...\", while his mother offered to trade him for one of my dogs.  As if.The Nuggets have been moved.  And I have the 15,000 steps on Fitbit to prove it.  While I am so happy that we finally got a measurable amount of rain - it made the day rather cold and damp.  I had to refit the tarp around the hoophouse (wiring the grommets to the frame this time), patch a mysterious hole in said tarp, make sure that there no obvious drafts, which meant affixing plastic in key areas, refitting a door (wherein I discovered that my memory of a hook and eye closure in the tool box was pure fantasy), setting up the big BIG feeder and waterer, setting up the electronet (not hooked up yet because I ran out of light and steam, not necessarily in that order).  Then I had to transport the meatballs from the brooder to the hoophouse.  That is, almost literally, from one end of the LLF to the opposite end.  Up the steps to the deck, down the steps off the deck, through two gates.  All 23 of them.  By the last transport, I was not tenderly lifting them from box to floor, let's just say.All during this activity, I was the epitome of high fashion - torn muck shoes, grey, soggy socks (which started the day as white, dry socks), sweat pants, wet to the knees, sweatshirt, all covered with my dad's old mechanics coveralls and my favorite billed cap.  Wowza!  I am so shocked that I am still single."},

Once again, my brain - still in winter's icy grip - did not flex enough to realize that I needed to put the hose on the rain barrel BEFORE it was filled.  Sigh.  There is also a leak in my retractable hose, which means I really need to take a whole day (hahahahahahaha) and spend it on fixing things.  I am currently running in place as far as the poultry is concerned.  I have the tweenagers in the small coop - needing a temporary fence put around so they can stretch their legs and become safely acquainted with the big girls.  I have my few survivors from my first meat chick shipment - three and a half.  The half has a splayed leg and needs to be culled.  Then there are the little ones.  I had hoped to be able to add the first chicks into the new ones but, as all of us who have raised these Frankenchickens know, even a week's difference means that the survivors are three times the size of the newbies.  I may do it anyway.  I want to reclaim my laundry room.  And cut down on my morning chores.My youngest DS arrives tonight and will stay over with me before heading north to our parents' house.  Since we missed her birthday, I am making her a special birthday dinner - Wild Salmon with English Peas and Mustard Beurre Blanc (it leaped off the pages of the latest Living magazine), fresh asparagus (thanks to my neighbor), oven roasted sweet potato wedges, and a gluten free, flourless chocolate cake.  I had everything but the salmon and the sweet potato, so those were purchased - I've done pretty well, staying away from the grocery store, having only 'slipped' three times since January.  I am going to try and squeeze in a Ramp Walk this weekend - hopefully, I haven't missed them.  The chickens are finally settling into a laying routine and I average 7-11 eggs a day.  I have lots of butter churned and in the freezer.  I've started up my milk kefir again.  My spinach finally started to come up in the cold frame, only to be mowed down by some miscreant.  I rummaged around and found the old screen door from the poultry enclosure I took down last fall and popped that on top.  Let's hope something can be salvaged.  ******Is it just me, or do most women under the age of 35 sound the same?  Most of my observations come from the radio - I listen almost exclusively to NPR - but it seems as though, besides the sort of baby-girl-ishness, it's also forced through the throat and always comes up on the end as if they are very unsure of what they are saying.  I feel so old.  Then there is the young fellow with whom I work.  His speech is so peppered with \"like\" that I find myself counting them and not listening to a thing he's saying.  Yesterday he was all stressed - it doesn't take much - and broke his own record.  17 instances of 'like' in less than three minutes of conversation.  Maybe future generations will just beep and text.  It's discouraging.  Words and language are so wonderful - so powerful.  Elocution will soon be a dead art.******I was going to save this for my \"F\" post, but I need some input from you gardeners out there.  I am having a heck of a time with my fig tree.  It is in a pot and seems healthy enough, but as soon as it starts to leaf out, this happens:Sorry for the lousy pix - the leaves sort of 'prune' up along the edges, and turn brown.  Any observations would be greatly appreciated."},

Am. So. Excited.The rest of the weekend was spent cleaning up the raised beds, weeding, schlepping dirt around, more weeding, more schlepping, and planting.  I got some lettuce planted under hoops, rearranged my cucumber/bean bed to accommodate trellised beans AND bush beans.  I also planted some sweetpeas (encouraged by Mama Pea's success) and my red onions.  I had been poking around in a big box store's garden area and found a lone, bedraggled six-pack of curly kale.  As all it appeared to need was a good watering, I talked them down to less than half price, and they were taken home and put in the kale bed.I managed to slog along all day on Sunday, but have made the executive decision that all drudgery stops at 4 o'clock.  Sometimes I actually follow my own directions!  It was a great weekend for laundry and I got four loads dried on the line.  How nice it is to put away the racks - and the flannel sheets.  However, I keep waiting for the other snow boot to drop.  I've been tricked before, which is why I did not plant more.  Should the need arise, I can easily cover what I've planted.  By the time I was finished, I was covered with dirt.  What a glorious feeling.... :)  Now, if it would just rain.  It is as dry as dust out there.  On a sad note, I lost another chick - he/she was not as hearty as the other five and when I moved them to a box in order to clean out the brooder, it was too much for it.  I also opened the coop on Sunday morning to find that E-Claire had died during the night.  That was a tough one - she was the first homegrown chick here and a real character.  But she had developed a sour crop and had three years of ups and downs.  The sheep got out on some grass on Sunday and were thrilled.  I had to keep an eye on them, with the heat and threat of bloat.  I have decided that Linden is not the sharpest tack in the box.  As a matter of fact, I would refer to him as a marble in a box of tacks.  While it's much better now that their woolly coats are off, they still can get sunburned and overheated.  The other two, Juno and Norman, and the llama know to head for shade if it's hot and take breaks to suck down water.  Not Linden.  He goes around like a lawnmower.  I had to physically move them up to the barn and close them in a shady space.  He was actually panting!  My problem child."},
{"title": "Carnage, Coppertox and Green Cheerios.", "date": "Friday, May 1, 2015", "text": "If that heading doesn't make you want to pull the covers up over your head, I want what you're having for breakfast...In my usual chaotic week's activities, Wednesday was more chaotic than usual.  I had scheduled my shearer to come mid-afternoon-ish, so had planned on taking a half-day of vacation.  I really should know better by now.  Really.Late morning, I got a call from my post office.  My meat chick order had come in and needed to be picked up before 3.  I was surprised, as they were supposed to be shipped Tuesday and I usually received them in the early morning of the second day.  This is the first time that I have ordered chicks from this hatchery.  I chose them for all good reasons:  1) they were closer than the hatchery I usually use (meaning less stress and a shorter transport for the chicks); 2) they hatched their own chicks, as opposed to contracting them out; 3) they were notably cheaper - including vaccinations in the per-chick price and their shipping was less than half of what I had been paying; 4) it was a family-run, small operation; and 5) they had gotten rave reviews.  I hurried through the basics at the office and headed out to the post office.  When I walked in, the postmistress and a customer were discussing my chick shipment.  Both were shaking their heads sadly.  As I stepped up to claim my shipment, I noticed that the box did not make the usual ear-splitting peeping.  That was because, out of 20 chicks, only six had survived.  And only one of those had a good pair of lungs.  I was devastated.  As ironic as it sounds - I mean, meat chicks are for, well, meat - it is heartbreaking to see that many tiny yellow bodies.  I had gotten the car good and warmed up, so popped the box under the floor heater and headed for home.  At home there awaited and brandy-new brooder, with whizzbang heaters, warm lights and safely snugged in my shed.  Blissfully away from the  house.  The reality was that I could not put six extremely stressed chicks in that big brooder.  Le sigh.  Into the laundry room they went, with a Jerry-rigged brooder, warm lights, specially treated water with probiotics and electrolytes.  They were pretty droopy.  They remain stressed, but are alive and I hope that they pull through.  I called the hatchery and was informed that, yes, they had had trouble with the shipper.  I would say so.  They are replacing the order next week.  Which means more time off and now I have a LOT of them.  Le sigh again.  I really should stop trying to plan.****The shearer did not arrive until almost 5:45 - over two hours after our scheduled appointment.  Although I knew there was a high probability that he would be running late, I had almost given up hope.  Good thing I didn't.  I love my shearer - and he brought along his fiance who I now equally love.  All three sheep were in good shape, with the exception of my problem-child, Linden.  He has perennial hoof problems.  His hoof rot was back, dammit.  However, J, my shearer, knows his stuff and is not afraid to cut down drastically to get as much of the damaged foot material off.  He draws blood, something I am loathe to do.  And, his fiance is a nurse!  She doctored his gory foot, drenched it in Coppertox, then Wound Kote, then bandaged him up.  They also took charge of all the drenching and vaccinating, so all I did was fetch and carry.  We have a long way to go, and I have to paint Coppertox on Lindy's hooves for a few weeks, but I think we have a chance.  It was the best $40 I ever spent.**** Dexter continues to thrive - he's a handful.  Even though his man parts were banded this past Sunday.  As my farmer neighbor and his fairly-useless sidekick labored away, he said, \"Wow, I'm glad we're not using these on ME - they look like little green Cheerios!\"  Ouch.﻿"},

{"title": "I can explain.", "date": "Monday, April 13, 2015", "text": "Not surprisingly, I have a lot of explaining to do.  Firstly, I have been MIA on my blog.  I believe this is an annual occurrence - I spend all that time whining about winter and it will never end (blah, blah, blah), then it does pretty much end and I'm all, \"OMG, I have too much to do!  I don't know where to start!  Where's my blankie???\"  and no writing gets done.  I am officially kicking myself in the keester and getting back into somewhat regular posting - like it or not.Then there is the Dexter excuse.  (Like how I threw that in, all nonchalant-like?)  Some days it is downright dangerous to do simple things.  Like go visit my cows and get milk.  I haven't been for a while, as the bronchial thing had me down and out and not wanting to spread it around.  But, a week ago, I tottered down to the barn to give my Jasmine a good head scritching (she loves it) and go kiss her daughter, Alice, on her big wet nose (she is not sure whether she likes it - but she doesn't hate it).  My farmer was acting rather odd - sort of jumpy.  He waits until his farmhand (using the term loosely) goes off out of earshot and then hisses in my ear, \"I NEED TO TALK TO YOU!\"  Good lawd.  Whatever?  So, I trot after him as he moves the milking units from cow to cow, until he finally decides we are safe and he can speak.\"Alice had a bull calf.\"  I am disappointed, because we always hope for a heifer, but, since she was field bred to an Angus bull, there wasn't much excitement in the heifer department this year anyway.  \"Well,\" I say, \"isn't that nice.\"  I should have wheeled around and gone blissfully on my way, but he continued.  \"It's going to be a week before I can go to the auction and C insists he wants to raise that calf for beef!\"  C is his erstwhile farmhand, who is also a relative.  Therein lies the rub, as it is saideth.  \"I'm NOT going to let him have it because he's a butthead and doesn't know his ass from his elbow.\"  No argument here.  \"So, YOU have to take him home.\"  WHA?That is how it came to be that Dexter moved into my barn.  The sheep look upon him with terror - he's an alien that has landed in their midst.  Of course, he's too young to mix with the lard butts, and is still on a bottle, so he is safely ensconced in a small pen in the barn.  Yes, that's right.  A bottle baby.  A BIG bottle baby.  A BIG, BOUNCY bottle baby.  So far, he has been melded into the chore schedule without too much trouble.   Other than those damn big calf bottle nipples - geezloueeze, they're a bugger to get on.  My laundry load has doubled, as I am covered with slobber and milk replacer by the end of the day.  He gets banded next weekend and I am hoping that will slow him down a bit.  And I am working really, really hard not to get attached.As I sat last night, poking around in my fevered brain, trying to find the Pollyannaism in of all this, I realized that I had built a sort of chute in the barn that I could use for the sheep in the future.  It's a rather pathetic Pollyannaism, but it will do."},

{"title": "Time.", "date": "Sunday, March 22, 2015", "text": "I had been thinking about time recently - and how I used to be so diligent about wearing a watch.  I think it was also a matter of fashion (yes, I once actually thought about what I was wearing and how it fit into the larger world around me).  At one point I owned six watches!  Now?  I almost never wear one.  It got so frustrating to have the batteries wear down and then have to go in search of someone who would replace them.  While I was musing away about time and watches, I received an email from someone at invaluable, an online auction house.  He wanted to know if I would be interested in joining in their 'watch' project, posting on my blog about watches.  Whoa.  While I don't, as a rule, do any link-ups with commercial sites, this was sort of, well, serendipitous.  So, I am going to do my usual randomness on watches.  I'm not sure this is what they had in mind (they have lots and lots of very nice watches), but once I get going, there's no reining me in.My first watch was covered in fake pearl, to match the pearl-studded snap buttons on my pink and green plaid Western cowgirl shirt.  If I could have found fake pearl cowgirl boots, holster and six guns, I would have lived in them.  It was all about the style back then - when I was 9.  I was very careful with that watch and managed to keep it until my second adult move, when the box in which it was carefully packed was stolen.Aside here - I moved often in my life.  And I moved myself 98% of the time.  Almost every move cost me a box.  Apparently, there were nefarious forces at work.  Even when I moved to the Netherlands, customs managed to 'forget' to put one of my boxes back in the container.  That is how I ended up with a china service for 8 with no dinner plates.After that, I gradually accumulated six watches - a gold Omega watch, a silver watch, a watch with a fake black alligator skin band, two Swatch watches, and an old wind-up watch that I found in the bottom of a box of buttons I got for a dollar at an estate sale.  I was at the peak of my fashion-ness.  That was also the era in which I wore pink platform shoes with sparkles in the three-inch soles.  And hot pants.  It didn't get more fashionable than that.   How things have changed....When I worked in the City, my boss wore a Rolex and so did his wife.  He was always buying her lovely gifts - emerald earrings from Tiffany's, 18th Century oil paintings of dogs from Christie's of London (he'd come in early in the morning, bid over the phone, then leave me a message telling me to work out how to get the paintings from London to the City.)  I got to toddle over to the Rolex cleaning suite, hand over her watch and wait in the darkened, plushy waiting room until I was summoned over to collect it.  To me?  It looked like a watch.  A very nice watch, but a watch just the same.  And, honestly, how much do we need our watches to do for us?  Take our pulse, track our mileage, weigh our protein, assist us with our speed-dating?  I will wear a watch if I have to keep track of time.  Otherwise, time is rather a fuzzy thing.  I am constantly guessing what time it is (most often, wrongly).  I have two (working) watches now.  One is an Orient - a self-winding watch.  The other is a watch that clips to a belt loop, so I can look down and check how far behind I am....  The timepiece that I rely on the most, however, is my inner clock.  It routinely wakes me up between 3:55 to 4:14 AM.  Sometimes it runs fast, sometimes slow.  But at least I don't lose it..."},

I am starting to see the tops of buckets and patches of ground around trees, so things are headed in the right direction.I've also started a list of spring repairs.  Be still my quavering heart!  I'm up to three pages and I am not finished!!  Gates came apart, fences need mending, there's a hole in the hoop house cover, ice dams wreaked havoc on my chicken yard fence/gate.  A lot of the back deck needs replacing.  The front of the coop needs a major overhaul.  I HAVE to finish the run-in shed.  Etc.  I'm not sure how to best attack the lot of it, but I think I will use the same strategy that I use in approaching my make-up each morning (minimal at best, but I do have to shore up a bit for the office crowd).  One eye at a time.  Or, in this case, one section at a time. I know that there is a precious little period where the ground is too soggy to start on the garden.  That is when I will pounce!  (snort)  First up are the gates and fences.  Then it's poop patrol (for all hooved and pawed residents).  Then coop-cleaning.  That's as far as I've gotten.  Of course, given that I have one day a week to do most of it, that may be as far as I get.  I also want to start more of my own plants this year - on time.  Last year I was a little over-eager and started them too soon.  Too many were so leggy they didn't do well or make it at all.  It's not easy being patient.******Every year I celebrate St. Patrick's Day the Sunday before the actual day.  I avoid the day itself, as it is too often a day marred by idiots+drinking+driving.  As is usually the case, I have my parents and their besties (my neighbors) over for dinner.  This year I also had my neighbor who makes my life so much easier (as he does for most of his neighbors).  In the past, I would have gotten an expensive cut of brisket, organic taters and carrots and cabbage, whipped up three soda breads - making sure that everything was cooked as traditionally as possible.  Well, let's just say that this year was different.  I had gotten a cheap cut of brisket before my non-shopping at the store vow and had it in the freezer.  I did manage to snag an organic cabbage and carrots at a winter farmers market.  I had potatoes in storage.  I resorted to the crockpot (never to look back, I may add).  I made two GF soda breads that I thought I had ruined due to multi-tasking, but they were fine.  I vacuumed the house to within an inch of it's life, put Pepper in lock down (he injured his back - see 'run of bad stuff' referenced above), did twelve loads of laundry and draped it all over the house on Saturday.  Somewhere around 10A Sunday, I started to hyperventilate.  This happens all the time.  Instead of a go-with-the-flow attitude, I get a OMG-what-if! attitude.  It's not helpful.  Desperate to get myself on a more even keel, I put a meditation cd on the stereo.  By jiminy, it worked!  While it will take years of practice to whip my frantic brain into a single focus, hearing the calm voice settled me down, as I flitted about with my dust mop, going \"ooooom\" and \"aaaaaah\".  The dogs were skeptical.  My parents arrived, Pepper was assigned to my dad's lap (they both loved it), their besties arrived shortly afterward and then it was like hearing birds chattering.  I got to putter around in the kitchen, set the table, heat the plates, serve the food.  It was fun.  After everyone had gone and the dishes were cleaned up, the dogs were all in an exhausted, happy heap.  Pepper was snug in his little bed with a heated rice bag on his back.  Lovey was snoring away, all three marrow bones held close to her chest.  Scrappy was snoring loudly, wrapped in his blankie on the favorite end of the couch.  I was tucked in a chair with the New Yorker magazine and a nice cup of tea.  All was right with my world."},

Do you have that job today?  I wanted to be a cowgirl.  I wanted to ride horses all day, rope cattle and roll my own cigarettes.  Of those three things, the only thing I accomplished (more or less) was to roll my own cigarettes.  Ahem.  No, today I am doing three things that I dislike intensely - commuting a long distance, working with lawyers, and having to deal with state legislators.    2.  What are your 3 favorite books?  This is a tough one.  I love so many books.  All time favs would be - Alice in Wonderland, A Confederacy of Dunces; The Beak of the Finch.     3.  If you have to move out of the country, where would you move to?  Did that - to the Netherlands.  If I had to move somewhere else, it would be Tuscany, but I would rather discover all the places I have not seen in this country first.     4.  Can you cook?  Why, yes, I can.  To my detriment, as I never bother cutting a recipe in half and then eat the whole thing by myself.       5.  Is there any post you’ve been planning to do, but have been postponing for awhile now?  Something that would make me a living legend.  Obviously, it will take more than awhile.     6.  If you could have any super power, what would it be? Why?  This always makes me think of my friend, Rosie.  When she would meet a fellow on a dating site, one of her first questions was, \"What is your super power?\"  I don't know what answers she got, but mine would have answered, \"the power to pull the wool over your eyes\".  I digress.  My super power would be the ability to fly like a bird.  I may have a fear of heights, but I also have a love of large vistas.  Plus, it would be a neato keeno way of escaping from the bad guys.     7.  Do you prefer the beach or the mountain? Why?  I am a mountain girl.  No beaches for me, as I am terrified of water (as in being in or on it).  Mountains make me feel that I am closer to the beginning of everything, even if we were supposed to have wiggled out of the water as some kind of legless blobs.  Mountains make me all weepy and, yet, feeling that I can do anything.     8.  What movie did you love to watch as a child?  The Wizard of Oz.  My sisters and I would get to watch it each year in my parent's bedroom.  We would be in their bed, under the covers, with lots of pillows at our backs.  The covers would be pulled up just below our noses - waiting for the appearance of the Wicked Witch.  We would haul those covers up and over our heads, screeching in terror!     9.  What is something that you learned recently?  I'm working on learning to drop spindle spin.  It's not going well, but I am determined.  I have also been learning to preserve by different means than by canning.  That has been interesting.     10.  What is your favorite season of the year and why?  Late Summer, into Fall.  Or Fallish.  The garden has reached its peak, the heat of Summer has died back, the leaves start to color, the air is rich with ozone.  I am looking forward to a Winter rest.  (That part nearly made my laugh so hard I choked.)     11.  What TV series do you watch?  I have not watched television for over ten years.  It has been very freeing.  I will admit that, every time I see a clip of Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood on YouTube, it makes me cry with loss.   Now you know even MORE about me.  If you have any complaints, go tell NancyPo.  Kidding."},

Applesauce?  Peachsauce?  ????\"  I gave in and up, and will take up the last of it another day.  Sometime in the future.  Honest.Besides Slim/Slom/Salami and the Plastic Bag Incident this past weekend, I also was greeted by Pepper the Cat Food Eating Dog, slinking out of the cats' room, trying to look nonchalant.  He failed.  He had managed to squirm his little carcass between the door jamb and the baby gate and had Hoovered up 2/3s of their dry food before I caught him.  Visions of pancreatitis danced in my brain.  He was not a happy camper for the rest of the day.  He drank copious amounts of water - which meant watching him like a hawk, as all dachshunds would much rather pee on your carpet than outside in the snow.  Or outside at all.  He's been on a prison diet of white rice and chicken broth for two days.  I'm surprised he's not gnawing on the furniture.  However, he does seem to have perked up and is back spinning for his dinner.  Never a dull moment."},
{"title": "Channeling the Mediterranean and a GC Update.", "date": "Monday, January 19, 2015", "text": "Gloom.  That about sums up the winter so far.  The up side (there is ALWAYS an upside, albeit a tiny one) is that the frigid temperatures are not as long-lasting as last year's.  They are punctuated by a spike in temps with rain.  Joy.  Finding myself the recipient of five days in a row where I was not at my office, I decided to de-stress by going on a purge.  Of my crafting closet.  It turned out to be a half-purge, as I ran out of steam after just going through the fabric half of the closet.  In my defense, I already had a sort-of organized system, using the word \"organized\" very loosely.  I crammed all the fabric, wrapping paper and that sort of thing on the left, and crammed all the yarn, various crafting trends I lost focus in, painting stuff and all things fiber on the right.  It was a frightful mess.  The last straw was when I had a small gift bag that I wanted to keep (along with the other 505 gift bags I knew I would need...someday) and opened the door quickly, shoved it in, and slammed the door so nothing would tumble around my ears.  Sad, sad, sad.  Taking a deep breath, pulling on my BGPs (the same sorry ones I've been pulling on for years - haven't had the gumption to enter a store since the holidays), I made a pot of tea and charged in.  Four hours later, I had two of my favorite pop-up bags (from Sylvie, who tries even from afar to whip me into shape) spilling over with oddments and bodkins.  There were two pillow forms (new in the bag), yards of fabric, sewing notions, craft supplies, gift bags...., wrapping paper, gift tags, all kinds of stuff.  I managed to shove everything into a 30+ gallon trash bag and put it on Freecycle.  I know, I know.  I am a glutton for punishment.  I had six requests within 5 minutes of listing it.  They ranged from:  I WANT IT!  to \"I want it and am in North Adams if you can deliver it today\".  North Adams is a 45 min drive.  I got downright snarky - in my heading, I had dutifully listed the location.  Very clearly.  One woman wanted to know if I was in another town.  In another state.  I informed her I was with the bag in the town listed.  The first normal sounding person was due to pick it up Saturday night.  She never showed.  Apparently, something came up and she forgot.  Sigh.  I declined to hold it for her until next weekend.  No. 2 showed up and lugged it off.  Besides the aggravation of having to deal with the knuckleheads, it was such a great feeling - getting all that stuff out of the house.  I was going to continue with my yarn side, but I have too much emotional attachment to my yarn, so am waiting until my backbone regenerates.I bet you are wondering what the heck the Mediterranean has to do with all that.  Well, nothing.  As usual, I went rambling on and on.  The Mediterranean has to do with my Meyers lemons.  I had a nice crop this year, even with my shameless neglect of my adored tree.  But what to do with all those lemons coming ripe at the same moment?  For once, I did not go online.  I moseyed over to my cookbook shelves and pulled out my favorite wintertime reading - Mediterranean Vegetarian Feasts, by Aglaia Kremezi.  Lawsymersy, if this book doesn't make you feel all warm and balmy, nothing will!  It is one of my favorites.  I had spied a recipe for preserved lemons in there, so leafed through to see if I had what was needed.  Close enough (my motto).  Voila! (or Eureka! since we are referring to Greece...)The whole process made the kitchen smell all lemony (in that distinct Meyers' way) and sunny.  I left a few lemons for fresh use, but I cannot wait to try these out.  I have my eye on about seventeen recipes in the book...Which leads me to (more quickly than usual...) the GC update.  I realized this weekend, that I need to quit cooking for a while.  I am not using up the prepared things in my freezer as fast as I need to.  I think I have \"Must Cook\" hardwired into my brain on weekends.  I made a deal with myself that I would only make soup.  I always take something up to my parents (at 91, my mother is tired of cooking - go figure), so soup is what they get.  I did roast a half-chicken from my stash, then made chicken stock and tidbits for the dogs, along with a nice chicken pot pie with a GF biscuit crust.  Meh on the crust.  I need to make my own baking mixes.  I am now set for the week.Now that the warm snap is gone - down to single digits again tomorrow night - I may just live on soup."},

An aside here,  For those of you who think that our highway departments - who face winter every stinkin year, and who had been listening, I am sure, to the same dire warnings of the oncoming nor'easter for a week prior to its arrival - would have had the roads cleared to make sure that this, the most-traveled day of THE ENTIRE YEAR, would be safe, would be wrong.  Not a plow in sight.  I do believe they sit in their garages waiting for the clock to strike overtime.  Dastards.  I digress.She and I had been in regular contact through the white-knuckle drive.  We were both a wreck, but I wasn't driving.  I was cleaning surfaces - something I do when I am highly stressed.  She said she was going to try to get her car off the road and was going to knock on the door of a house that was nearby with the lights on.  The next call came minutes later - she had parked her car in their driveway and could I pick her up.  I got the address and headed out - even with four wheel drive, the road was treacherous.  I am still amazed that she made it as far as she did in one piece.Turns out she had knocked on the perfect door.  The Universe had directed her to a family who is the poster-family for kindness, warmth and hospitality.  Not only did they insist she park her car in their nice, shoveled driveway, but invited her in to use the bathroom, made her a cup of tea and fed her cookies.  They let her leave her car overnight so that we could come get it the next morning when the roads were clear (triple overtime guarantees clear roads).  When we arrived to pick up her car, they had cleaned it off before they left for their own Thanksgiving trip.  I tell you, the whole experience gave me a new and kinder view on humanity.The storm abated and left every surface with a coating of snow.  It was beautiful.  Until I had to shovel it...Pepper loves his Aunt Cynthia and was quite crushed when I didn't bring her back on Thursday.  He has been watching the cats and has discovered a way to insert himself in your view at every level.  My sister heads back today, thankfully with clear roads and nothing more than arctic temperatures.  If this is an omen of winter to come, I might as well sew myself into my long johns right now."},

ACK!

Firstly, I came home to a new, expanded and improved driveway!  (Pictures tomorrow)  I feel a bit better about accepting this 'service' from my neighbor, as it seems he has done the same or similar for other neighbors.  I am, however, going to slip a dozen eggs into their mailbox every week.  It will slightly ease my conscience.Saturday morning I arose at my usual o'dark thirty so that I could bake for the local library's book and bake sale.  I have been dying to try a recipe for Lemon Blueberry Bread (GF).  It smelled heavenly and I figured it would be a good seller.  When I came in from morning chores, I discovered that it must have tasted wonderful - someone had taken a HUGE bite out of the middle of it.  After emitting a screech that would set off car alarms, should I still live in Brooklyn, I stormed into the living room and easily spotted the culprit.  Lovey sat, looking at everything and everyone but me, with blue crumbs stuck to her nose and muzzle.  It was so hysterical that I had to laugh.  Then I put her in her crate.  I had just enough time to whip up a GF Lemon Glazed Zucchini Bread, although it went to the sale still warmish in its plastic cocoon.  I hope it didn't turn into a sodden mess.  I dropped off my recyclables and made it home in time to work on the garden, run the vacuum, peel back the tarp over the nuggets (no rain predicted for a few days - hallelujah!) so I can dry it out a bit.  I picked up feed, paid a short visit to a friend, came home and unloaded the car and cleaned as much of the dog hair I could out of it.  Then it was off to the city to pick up my aunt and uncle, flying in from Arizona to visit my folks.  I discovered that most of the heavy-duty construction is done on weekends.  Thank goodness I gave myself an extra half-hour, because I needed every minute.  Their plane arrived early!  Then I schlepped them to Vermont, dropped them off, got their luggage inside, said \"have fun\" and drove home.Sunday was more garden work - I decided to turn the failed strawberry bed that lines the front walk into a flower bed.  This meant ripping out all the strawberry plants and transplanting my bee balm.  I have to build up the bed, so I rummaged around and found a 4x4 and a pile of bricks and got it half done.  No one can accuse me of being a dead ringer for \"Martha\".  It's Hillbilly All The Way!  I got the laundry on the line and then met a friend for more blueberry picking.  Technically, I did not NEED more blueberries.  But I am not one to turn down free food and spending time talking with someone not on four feet.  I got back in time to throw a roaster pan full of tomatoes and basil into the oven, then my friend Lisa came over to get wood chips.  We had a delightful, but short, visit, and I started on the sheep and llama area.  Got everything raked and shoveled 9 - five gallon buckets o' beans for future use.  I also forked a pile of composted hay/manure around the bare roots of the big fir tree that is next to their barn.  If I keep them in this area for winter, I will have to wrap the trunk with chicken wire.  A sheep can de-bark a tree in a nanosecond.I then stopped.  Except for chores.  Cooking-wise, I made a Gluten Free Tabbouleh Salad that was/is delish!  I also defrosted some cooked chicken and made chicken fried rice, having discovered a container of cooked rice that needed dealing with.

Please email your mailing address or let me know, either way.Thanks, everyone, for participating!  The next giveaway will most likely involve cats....(KIDDING, Carolyn....I think....)"},

Every year - no matter how often and thoroughly I check the vines - one drops under my radar.  And why are the cukes ripening and the tomatoes not?  What wacky misfire of nature is this?  Get it together, Ma Nature!"},

Apparently, one SIDE is better.  Or so thinks Lovey.She had a few firsts this past weekend - first siting of a cow.  First close up of a chipmunk.  My farmer's cows (along with a relieved Jasmine, Alice and Rosebud) are now out on the pasture - up to their udders in nice, green grass.  This makes for a bucolic sight as we walk along the road to the farm.  While the cows no longer strike terror into the heart of Scrappy (unless they are on the wrong side of the fence), Lovey reacted as if aliens had abruptly landed in her world.  Tail between the legs, ribbon of fur upright along her spine, Velcroed to Scrappy and wanting very badly to be heading in the opposite direction.  Then the cow bellowed and that was that.  She led the way as we were catapulted towards home.Chipmunks, however, are a lot more fun.  There was a cheeky devil that sashayed across the deck while we were all out enjoying the sun.  He ran under the woodpile and Lovey spent a busy 20 minutes trying to unearth him.  This seems to be the Year of the Chipmunk - there are tens of them darting about, little buggers.

{"title": "History repeats itself.", "date": "Thursday, May 22, 2014", "text": "After I lost my roo, Roquefort, I wasn't too worried about the hens' safety because I had a back-up - Little Bit.  Also known as Short Pants.  He was my \"Free Exotic Chick\" from Murray McMurray (I have now gotten smarter and turned down the free chick offer - it's always a cockerel and I'm not impressed with male exotic-ness.  In chickens, that is...).  After lurking in the shadows of the large-but-marshmallowy Roquefort, Short Pants came into his new, elevated position with a vengeance.  The hens were not impressed.  Nor was I.  He did have a nicer, more classic crow than Roqie - who had sort of a tin-can-against-metal-grating crow.  But there lurked something dark and insidious under Shorty's feathery countenance.He was Ivan the Terror reincarnated.  Ivan the Terror was the meanest rooster this side of the Mississippi and he made my previous life a living hell.  While I try not to paint roosters (or people) with the same paintbrush, there are similarities that cannot be ignored.  Shorty looks to be a Dominique rooster.  Ivan was a Dominique rooster.  I raised Shorty from a chick and lavished attention on him.  Ditto Ivan.  All was peachy until the hormones kicked in.  Ditto all over again.Luckily, the brother of Roquefort has been residing at DS Melanie's.  He will soon be taking up residence at the Little Lucky.  Shorty?  I have plans for him and they don't include retirement.  His reign will be brief.It's been a tough year for the poultry on the homestead.  Since last fall, I have lost over six hens and my rooster.  Some loss could be traced to old age - I have some geriatric birds - some to possible heart attack (Betty & Roqie), some to hawk attack (Peanut & Nutty Ameracauna 3), and some are just unknown (Violet).  It's always a tricky business keeping the flock at a number that a) won't eat you out of house and home; and b) will be young enough to lay enough eggs to at least pay for their feed.  I am now faced with the majority being 'up there' in age.  Do I let them dwindle to a smaller, cheaper flock, or do I boost the laying power so that I don't lose the egg customers I've built up.  Dunno.  I do know that I am not going to order a bunch of fancy-pants chicks - the hens that seem to thrive are the homebirds - the mutts.  So, with that in mind, I have been putting aside a few eggs for DS Melanie to incubate.  Who knows?  I may just hatch a Son of Roquefort!  Wouldn't that be nice.Under the category of making lemonade out of lemons, yesterday morning the tree crew arrived on my road to rape, pillage and plunder clear the trees under and around the power lines.  Apparently, they no longer trim branches.  They cut everything down to the ground.  I was very unhappy to hear this, as they will be clear-cutting 90 percent of the trees along the road that offer some protection from the noise, dust and dirt from the gravel trucks.  Apparently, I have no rights.  What a surprise.  Not.  As I sauntered over, I could see them start the nervous shuffle and start bunching together.  Since there was no reason to give them a piece of my mind, I, instead, asked for all the chipped material and some maple branches for the goats and sheep.  They were so relieved that I was not going to yell at them, that they gave me TWO truck loads of chips and a huge, nicely stacked pile of leafy branches.  Sometimes, you just have to go with the flow.  Next farm, I will be someplace where I either have more rights or am far enough off the beaten track that I can feel justified putting machine guns in turrets and shooting their tires out.  Kidding.  Sort of."},

Fizz....", "date": "Monday, May 19, 2014", "text": "After the monsoon Friday night, the weekend morphed into a rather nice one.  Saturday was spent in VT - work done on the car, visit with my parents, sister and BIL, weeding, watering and cleaning up in the greenhouse, then home.  I had hoped to get some things done in the garden, but I had a friend coming over for dinner, so those hopes were jettisoned out the door.  That led to a very busy day on Sunday.  Besides the usual Sunday activities (dog walking, barn/cow visiting, baking), my neighbor showed up to mow my grass and zap my weeds.  What a difference!  However, I realized that, as time double-times along, I will soon be mowing my own grass and zapping my own weeds - my neighbor is closing in on 80 and has slowed down noticeably this year.  Even though he insists on helping me, I can read the writing on the wall.  I am researching cordless weed trimmers - I really can't take all that noise, especially on top of my neighbor's endless chainsawing and his grandson's little, very annoying motor scooter.  That he drives up and down and up and down and up and down their driveway.  It seems they save their hearing-challenging activities for Sunday.  Laundry got washed and hung on the line.  It was a perfect laundry day - not too hot but sunny and breezy.  Three loads were washed and dried in no time.  Then there was weeding, shoveling, hauling, weeding, shoveling, hauling, raking, etc.  I got all but one of the raised beds ready for planting.  I had already planted three kinds of beets, three kinds of kale, collard greens (new this year), mustard greens (ditto) and chard.  The garlic is growing well, the onions are coming along, and I think I am finally seeing the evergreen bunching onions coming up (new).  I have about three wheelbarrow-fuls of dirt from the pile that has been 'aging' on my driveway for two years.  Once that's gone, I can call in my shifty neighbor with the gravel business who offered to deliver free stone 'just because he's a good neighbor'.  I'll believe that when I see it in my driveway.All that's needed in the garden is to finish topping off one bed and to plant everything.  Each early spring, I tell myself it's time to cut back, as I am only planting for one person.  Every late spring, I have run out of room.  It looks as if I will have to get inventive when it comes to my summer squash.  But all of this is moot.  Nothing else is getting planted because we had two morning of frost.  Which zapped my strawberry flowers.  Looks like the harvest will be delayed.  I did remember to swaddle my lemon tree - which is fruiting up very nicely...Inside, things are fermenting -- a batch of kombucha and milk kefir, to be exact.  I am slowly bringing my kefir back to life and this is my first time with kombucha.  I have been smart enough this time to put the jars way separate - no co-mingling of those little bacteria - and, at the same time, somewhere where I won't forget them (who, me?)  Fun!  I was looking forward to adding fresh strawberries into my daily kefir, but will have to - sigh - settle for my frozen blueberries.  Poor me."},

It had Blood-letting!", "date": "Monday, May 12, 2014", "text": "Now that I have your attention ... my weekend recap.  Sorrow - my beloved Roquefort died sometime Thursday night.  I had raised him from a day old chick and he had everything I wanted in a rooster - beauty, gentleness with the hens, and he gave me a wide berth.  Wednesday he was his fine self.  Thursday, he was not.  I've been trying to figure out what happened - poison?  heart attack? - but I will never know.  Little Bit has thrown himself into Lead Roosterdom with a vigor that I do not appreciate (nor do the girls).  I am saving some eggs with the hope that I can beg cajole my DS Melanie into incubating them and hatching a hopeful Son of Roquefort.  Betrayal - Lovey let me down.  Actually, I set myself up for it.  Friday, I had to run over to a neighbor's to drop off a form and had a little chat.  I was gone, maybe, 30 minutes.  When I came home, it looked like someone had broken in and tossed the place.  Shredded paper, packing envelopes, magazine, knitting needles (my only pair of 7s), mostly punctured favorite hand lotion bottle.  It was a mess.  It appears that Lovey suffers from separation anxiety - she is fine when I am outside working; apparently she can keep her eye on me.  But, once Kyle leaves the driveway, it's the End of the World.Ups - the weather (Sunday) was perfect.  Breezy, warm, sunny.  I worked my elbow off and crammed in as much as possible, as I had to bisect my day by driving up to VT, picking up my mom and dad, and driving to their fav restaurant for dinner.  I guess that's an Up and Down.  I got some plants in, did a lot of weeding and cleaning up, and moved a lot of dirt.  I also vaccinated the goats for CDT, a job that I know too well should NOT be put off.  The sheep got a little grass time - actually, more than I had planned, as the dreaded duo of Linden and Juno managed to push their chubby bodies through the gate and got in a lot more grass time.  No bloat, as I have been slowing working them into grass.  Blessing there.  Even Norman is putting on weight!  He needs to be coated and I KNOW I ordered two coats for him.  I even remember running across the coat recently.  Do you think I could recollect where I saw it?  Nope.  Nada.  No way, Jose.Downs - the weather on Saturday.  Sun.  Pouring rain.  Sun.  Pouring rain.  Unfortunately, the sun did not hold out for very long in between the downpours.  I didn't get much done - but I did get to visit with Marianne!Blood-letting - I have discovered a tick on my person every day for the last three days.  Luckily, they have been (mostly) located where I could actually get at them.  This is one of the drawbacks of living with only dogs.  They have no opposable thumbs and cannot work a pair of tweezers.  Since I have been feeling sort of achy and fatigued of late, a dim light bulb went off and I am wondering if I am suffering from Lyme's Disease.  I am loathe to go to the doctor, especially when this is one of those elusive diseases that can throw both false positives and false negatives.  But I am tired of being tired, redundant or not.  So tomorrow morning, bright and early, I am seeing the PA.  I realized that I spend way more time checking the dogs for ticks than myself.  Time for a full length mirror or a breathable Hazmat suit..."},
{"title": "Small World and Foiled Again.", "date": "Wednesday, May 7, 2014", "text": "Being now in business together, my DS Melanie and I have been splitting rhubarb plants and potting them up for sale.  (Let me say right here that, should I ever be stranded on an island - I would insist being stranded with DS Melanie.  She is amazing.)  I let them sit for a week, taking full advantage of a sprinkling of llama beans (the plants tripled in size in a week), and then took their picture and put them on Craigslist.The Power of Beans!Either everyone has Spring fever, there is a mad craving for rhubarb, or I happened to post them at the exact same time a bunch of gardeners were perusing the list - I had eight requests in less than an hour.   As is usually the case with these things, the first person lived over an hour and a half away and, although they wanted them, it made no sense.  (This is a real needle in my side - you must put down where you are located and yet, most people make no effort to check first.)  Gardener #2 wanted me to deliver them.  Gardener #3 lived close by and could pick them up that night.  Sold to Gardener #3!  I got a time range of between 6:30-7:30 and went about my nightly chores, waiting for their arrival.  7:30 came and went and no Gardener #3.  Another problem with these things - no-shows.  I was just about to curse them mightily, when there was a knock on the door.  We all jumped - the dogs now furiously barking, trying to make up for the fact that they let someone slip by...I opened the door - to find my hay guy!  You know how there is someone you know from one place and when you see them somewhere else, it throws you?  It also throws me because I have a major mojo crush on him.  Unfortunately, he is in a happy relationship.  Unfortunately for me, that is. I managed to stutter hello and he carted the plants to his van.  He came back up and handed me two packages of frozen venison.  \"I thought it might be you,\" he boomed in his velvety deep voice.  Sigh.  I gave him a quick tour to introduce the recipients of his great hay.  Then I blathered some more, then off he went.  Sigh.Then I eyeballed the venison.  I have been wrestling with changing my diet to vegetarian.  (A Lacto/Ovo/Vego, if you're into labels... *:-} ).  I have been trying to winnow out all meat products from the freezer and have seesawed on raising meat chickens this year.  Unfortunately, I have two friends who pleaded with me to raise some for them and I said yes.  I don't want to go back on my word.  Plus, I know how important it is to know where, how and why my food was grown/raised, and I have pontificated on this ad nauseum.  I also do not want to put myself in a position that I find personally loathsome - that of being a hypocritical farmer.  A vegetarian who raises animals for food.  That puts a twist in my knickers like nobody's business.The plan now (this would be, let's see, Plan X) is to eat mostly Lacto/Ovo/Vego until every speck of meat is gone and then make the change with a clear conscience.  It will also give me time to arm my recipe box with lots of good, nourishing, healthy LOV recipes."},
{"title": "Weekend Recap.  The Good, The Bad, the Butt-Ugly.", "date": "Monday, May 5, 2014", "text": "On Thursday, after dithering around about how I was going to get everything accomplished in the one non-rainy day (or so they said) this weekend, I ended up taking Friday off to gain another dry day (or so they said).  A genuine Mental Health Day.  I had an appointment to get my hair cut early in the morning, then came home, put on my Hazmat suit and tackled the chicken coop.  Every second wheelbarrow-full, the skies opened up and it poured.  It took me six loads.  And then there was the scraping.  I did not, however, give it the white glove treatment (hahahaha), so there are still a few things that need doing - sweeping down the ceiling and walls, cleaning the windows, repairing a window, replacing their door.  But it is cleaned out, the nesting boxes are all filled with clean, fluffy shavings, and I needed a break.So I had a glass of iced tea and tackled the goat barn.  I took out their feeder and dragged a cattle panel through two paddocks and three gates (that was SO much fun, I just can't wait to reverse the process), and fashioned a fence that bisected their run.  It just fit, so I was greatly relieved.  I managed to lure the goaties to the other side (non-barn) of their area, then tied about fifteen pieces of baling twine on both ends to secure it.  Then there was the issue of luring in the sheep and llama to a much smaller and alien space.  I did what I always do - I started with Norman.  If there is food involved, Norman is first.  If Norman goes first, the other two can't stand it and are close behind.  That just leaves helping Apria and her challenged sight find her way through a strange gate.  But it worked.  Just as I was settling my stinky, sweaty self into a chair with a glass of wine and a two-dog blanket, a series of events had me doing a fast and furious clean-up and then I went out for a pulled pork dinner with one of my favorite neighbors.  His wife wasn't up to it, so there I was.  Since this is a small town, we were teased unmercifully and I am sure the rumor-mill was churning away.  Let them talk - I had her permission.  Saturday dawned overcast and murky.  My shearer was supposed to arrive around 8:30A, so I did a little fancy footwork and got the llama and sheep separated and sheep closed in the goat barn.  The goats, meantime, managed to survive their new surroundings barnless (they did have a nice, roomy Dogloo) and spent the morning screaming at me.  I was inches from hanging a \"Free to ANY home\" sign around Sage's neck and putting her out at the curb.  My shearer did not show up until a quarter past ten.  So much for the rest of my plans.  The wait did afford me the chance to actually get organized and ready for him, however, so I am not complaining.  I had my CDT vaccine portioned into syringes, the wormer drench and drencher, and the hoof trimmers.  He brings his own, but I prefer using mine on my sheep - because I KNOW that I disinfect them.  Joe always brings his sidekick - his son, Carter.  Carter's been coming with him since he was a toddler (he's now about six) and it's rather nice to have him old enough that I don't have to run around fearing for his life.  He settled under the pines on an upturned bucket and played some video game, bursting into gales of laughter every now and then (Joe says he's a ham) and mimicking Sage to the point where she gave up.  I may have to hire him.It didn't take long to get everyone finished and I was shocked when Norman stood naked-ish.  He is very thin.  I realized that I had been treating him like an Icelandic - and not feeding him grain.  Norman NEEDS grain, poor boy.  The other piece of business was to deal with Linden's hoof rot.  Gak.  Thankfully, Joe did what needed to be done, as I don't have the heart to trim down that hard.  It always leads to bleeding - but it is necessary to start the real healing process.  So there I was, hoping that no one from PETA would come by.  I had one slightly malnourished sheep and another with a great bloody foot.  My nice routine is now on its ear*, as I have to find a way to feed grain to Norman twice a day - without the rest of them (except Apria) - and I have to start the Kopertox again on Linden's hoof.  I was happy to see that the bleeding stopped fairly quickly, but it is still sore and he barely walks on it.  And, just to make everything all tidy and finished in a pretty bow, the temperatures dipped, the rains haven't stopped, and my sheep are naked.  At least they have their nice dry run-in shed.By the time I got everything cleaned up and put away, it was too late to go to the presentation at the library.  I was disappointed, but what can you do?  And, since my coffee date had bailed on me, too,  I put on my gloves, grabbed some seed packets and my stirrup hoe and headed out to the garden.  I did a lot of weeding and planted bunching onions, collards, chard, and kale.  This way, I am guaranteed we will get a frost.  Just to make sure that I squeezed in enough to take advantage of the dryish day, I also repaired and reinforced the bottom of the POS chicken coop I had gotten from a friend.  I managed to get it done before the rain started, thanks to all the supervisors there to 'help' me.  My Speckled Sussex, Dotty, is extremely insistent on helping.Part of working so hard was my desire to block out the news I received on Friday.  One of my favorite new friends - the young farmer I had visited in January who was building up a farm on which to raise his young family - had been killed in an ATV accident earlier in the week.  He leaves behind his lovely, young family - wife, toddler daughter and a baby on the way.  It shook my foundations.  It made me indescribably sad.On the Lovey front, she has managed to charm everyone she has met.  I took both granddogs up to VT on Sunday to do errands, and for Lovey to meet her grandparents.  She sashayed up to my mother and gave her the adorable look - it was over in seconds.  She is such a good dog; smart, joyful, funny.  I had left her in the house twice with no supervision and the only casualty was a corner of a piece of newspaper.  Last night, as I was getting ready to move her to her crate for the night, she placed upon me such a mournful gaze that I caved in and let her sleep on the sofa next to Scrappy all night.  I am very pleased that she is making such good progress.  She even mastered \"sit\" in three tries.  Of course, it MUST involve a treat to work.  More work needs to be done.Then there is the sharing issue....This morning's routine was still off - as it was the first time I had to paint Kopertox on Linden's hoof and he was his usual self - eely.  I managed to paint his hoof, his leg and my sleeve.  Things are fragrant again.  Norman got his dish of grain, but I am struggling with a way to feed him without having to give the Icelandics anything - not even an oat.  This is not easy.  On the WIP front, I am down to sewing on the last strip of my potholder rug!  With any luck, it will be finished by Wednesday.  I am happy about the way it turned out and am thinking about working something up that is similar, but makes use of the 420 fleeces I have managed to accumulate.  Make that 423.  Pictures to come.In the kitchen - I made a batch of GF blueberry muffins from a new cookbook and they were good!  Still not like the regular, but tasty.  I used up the last of my wild blueberries - I still have a gallon freezer bag left.  The muffins were a hit in the barn Sunday morning, but I think those guys would eat just about anything.  I also roasted a chicken, made some awesome GF crackers and my favorite Carrot Rice.  Being rather desperate for anything green, I harvested a big mess 'o dandelion greens and cooked them up with some bacon and balsamic vinegar.  Ah....*This makes me think of a new 'old' saying that my dairy farmer neighbor told me Sunday morning - \"When the oak tree leaf is the size of a chipmunk's ear, plant corn.\"  Hoot!"},

I have pictures of both dogs on the fridge, and I point them out to Scrappy at every possible occasion.  It's a good thing there is no one of a two-legged stature, listening to this insanity.  I'm starting to get a glimpse of what I will be in 30 years.  And, frankly, it could be worse.  Maybe my nephew will make a documentary about his crazy ole auntie.*Is it just me, or is demanding over $300 for a rescue hybrid a bad idea?  I realize how much money and time is put into these dogs, but, c'mon, people.  That's a heck of a lot of money.  I am also sure that it's done to separate the wheat from the chaff, so to speak, and deter people with evil intentions, but it also deters those of us who just want to give them a loving, good home."},

{"title": "A Dying Breed.", "date": "Monday, March 10, 2014", "text": "Last Monday, a friend and neighbor passed away suddenly.  I had noticed lots of pick up trucks at the farm, but that was not extraordinary.  What I didn't know, until his son, also my friend and neighbor, knocked on my front door at 6:15 AM Wednesday morning, was that his father had passed away suddenly from a heart attack.While not surprised at the news, I was, nonetheless, greatly saddened.  Big L, the patriarch of a very large clan, was one of a dying breed of dairy farmers.  His father bought this farm many, many years ago (Big L was in his mid-eighties when he passed on), milking a relatively small number of cows - pretty much just enough to support his family.  Big L inherited the farm and continued the tradition, while raising a family of his own.  His first wife died of cancer and, eventually, Big L met and married a nice woman with children of her own, who he raised as his own, supporting a total of 11.  He was a hard worker, as are all dairy farmers.  There is no \"vacation\" for a dairy farmer.  It is a 365/24/7 job.  You have to know how to fix your own equipment, doctor your cows, bale your own hay, cut your own corn.  He finally handed the business down to his son, my present neighbor and friend.  Big L would drive the tractors at haying time, help cut the corn, and - of course - supervise.  His constant companion was a little Jack Russell terrier named Susie.  I think he loved that dog as much as any person.  His son is also the local dog warden and Susie was found as a stray and tippy-toed right into Big L's heart and home.  These last few years were tough ones for him, health-wise, and he spent most of his time sitting at his kitchen table with Susie by his side.  That is where he died.He was a familiar figure during his retirement - driving (sloooooowly) around the town in his red pick up, stopping here and there to discuss local politics, the weather, the sorry state of dairy farming.  I would be out in my garden laboring away and he would roll up, roll down his window, and I would lean against the truck and we would spend an enjoyable half hour or so, complaining, laughing, and gossiping.It is difficult to imagine passing by the farm (which I do twice a day) and not seeing the kitchen light on.  I'm glad I got to know him, and I will treasure the stories he told.  (One particularly alarming, yet funny, story involved Thanksgiving, a pair of loose trousers, and a close call.)  As is the custom here, there was a wake at his small church, followed by a service and burial in the local cemetery.  There were so many cars lining both sides of the road, that I had to park at a friend's house and walk down to the church.  As I looked over the gathering, lots of white hair and balding pates were interspersed in the congregation.  Alot of them are or were farmers, now retired.  Once his son decides to retire (or drops dead in the barn, as he declares), that is the end of this line."},

Coincidence or not, after slugging down a quart of the stuff, heavily laced with raw honey, my throat pain eased substantially.  Hooray!  Now I am left with the cement body suit and cotton wool.  I am not a good patient.  I am also glad that I have a long weekend in which to get myself back up to normal strength.  I did, however, take Friday off.  My doctor threatened me, good-naturedly, and I didn't argue.Lucy had her vet appointment Saturday, so off we slogged the hour and fifteen minutes to their vet.  They are very nice and Lucy is amazing in the car.  No pacing, no panting, no trying to get in the front seat.  She just settles in and enjoys the ride.  (Another upside of this now-head cold is that I cannot smell anything.  Even stinky dog.)  They gave her a once over, took blood, cleaned and medicated her ears (both are infected) and then fired off the info to the rescue.  I was pretty disappointed with their response.  They said to hold off running the blood test for another two weeks (which means I have schlep out there AGAIN), don't want to deal with her ulcerated skin tumor just yet, and generally made the whole trip unnecessary.  Except for the ear treatment.  I don't know if they are holding out for me to step up and adopt her - which I can't afford to do in any conceivable way - hoping that I will be caught between wanting to do the best for her and knowing that it is highly unlikely that anyone would adopt her in her present state.  I am aware of the costs of testing, biopsies, etc.  All to well.  But I don't think that a wait-and-see attitude is necessarily the best - especially when dealing with an unknown tumor and obvious symptoms that something is not working.  Nope, I am not a happy camper.  I'll have to do the best I can for her and enjoy my temporary, but very welcomed lack of smell.  Lucy seems to be settling in just fine.  The cats are still horrified - she still seems to be way too interested in them - Scrappy is stoic.  She's getting close to mastering the steps, she walks on a lead way better and she counter surfs.  This last bit of info is not great - I am not used to a dog that is large enough to cruise the counters.  I have to be diligent about putting things away and out of reach.  Being diligent is difficult when one's brain is swathed in damp cotton wool. I'm lucky I can put one cement-shod foot in front of the other.Lucy and I walked out of our vet appointment into a heavy snowfall.  It was pretty exciting on the way home.  For me, at least.  She was sacked out in the backseat.  I had just enough time to drop her off before I had to head up to meet a delightful young man who is in the process of building a working farm.  He raises Old Spot pigs, chickens, vegetables and is brimming full of good ideas.  He's just the type of new farmer this country needs, and I sure hope he does well.  I am going to promote his CSA (he does both a Vege and Meat CSA) as much as I can.  Being pretty self-sufficient, I am not in the market for either membership, but I would sure jump on the wagon if I decided to give up gardening and raising my own meat chickens.  He's also a talented web designer - take a look:  Hill Hollow Farm.  We schlepped all over the farm as he gave me the overview of his big plans.  I'm sold.  I was very happy that I had all wheel drive for the trip back down the mountain.  It just made me long for spring even more.  Is it April yet?"},

Saturday was spent begging my groomer friend to squeeze her in (which she did), then her bedding was washed and we have been working on basics - going outside (she does not seem to know what to make of the four steps up/down from the deck), not pulling me on the leash (she is strong!), not chasing the cats, walking on a leash.  I don't think she's been on a walk for a very long time and it took a while for the pulling and weaving to stop.  But it did.  She's a smart girl.  Next up is a visit to the vet - I don't think her thyroid meds are doing the job.  She's stinky already....  Unfortunately, the rescue's vet of preference is on the far west side of the city - a good hour plus with no traffic.  Fortunately, they have weekend hours, so we will be trying to book in next weekend.  I am thinking of her as my project.  She may remain a foster with us, but I will be working on getting her meds and diet aligned so that she has a healthy, non-itchy life ahead.  The Universe, it seems, has spoken....Lucy with her Buppy"},

Why is it that men can call men to borrow tools and only get the tools while, when women call men to borrow tools, they have to get the man, too?  Seriously - are they afraid you're going to break it?  That you are a helpless waif?  How helpless do they think I am, when I know to ask for a basin wrench?  Sigh.  In any event, the faucet is a fait accompli and I am so happy with it.  Of course, my aluminum sink was not shiny enough, so I had to clean that.  Then I noticed that my new stove was far from pristine, so I cleaned that.  Then I looked down and noticed the floor and cleaned that.  Then I put on my dark glasses and sat in a corner.Before sink-cleaning.Since we're talking about cleaning, Scrappy has been doing his bit to help me out.  He is still confused as to why he is an only child, but he's taking advantage of all the extra love and attention - and it's going to his waist...Good boy.Another item checked off the to-do list was the flannel-lined shades for the front windows.  Given our drastic drop in temperature (as I am typing this, the outside temperature has almost reached positive numbers), these have really made a difference at night.  And it makes me feel all snug.  The flannel came from an old flannel sheet, and the fabric is part of my embarrassingly large stash.The blue is darker than portrayed, with ablue-on-blue pattern.During the day, the shades are folded up.Notice how a certain someone manages to insinuate himselfinto almost every picture?Under the category of \"It's Always Something\", the sheep are - apparently - bored and have been chewing off Apria's neck fur.  I mean, really????  Plans are for the Chickster to be rehomed this weekend.  Please goD.  If that happens, Apria is going to be moved in with the girls.  This is getting ridiculous.I am off to tackle a couple more things off of my to-do list.  This would be my indoor to-do list.  As it is blowing and Arctic-like outside, that list can wait for spring."},

Place in a large vessel (is this related to a vestment?) that can take a beating. (I used my favorite giant ceramic mixing bowl.)  Add about 3 T of salt and mix well. Don’t be afraid to use your hands. Pound the sliced cabbage with a kraut pounder or other pounding tool until it begins to release liquid (a few minutes). Peel and core your apples and slice them about 1/4 inch thick. add to the mix and test the salt, adding the additional tablespoon if needed. Rule of thumb when making sauerkraut is to taste the mixture and add enough salt so that it is more salty than you would like if you were to eat it straight up, but not so salty that you feel like spitting it out. Pound the mixture a little bit more to break up the apples somewhat and release more juice. Add the blueberries last, partially thawed so as not to obliterate them, and pound again, lightly. If you are opting for caraway, add seeds now. Stir it all up.Using a two gallon crock or other container (I used half gallon Mason jars), put a couple handfuls of mixture into fermenting vessel at a time, pressing down to bring the juices up as you go. There should be liquid covering your kraut when you get near to the top of the jar. Leave an inch of room at the top. Weight top to keep kraut submerged. You can use a cabbage leaf with a rock on top.  If using mason jars, lightly screw on the lids and place in a roasting pan to catch any juices that bubble out from the lids.In three days, test your kraut. It should be ready to eat, but can ferment up to several weeks. Once it reaches the degree of crunchy/soft that you want, store in the refrigerator. It will continue to ferment at a much slower rate in cold storage.  I let mine ferment a little under two weeks, then put it in the fridge.  It is slightly crunchy, which is how I like my sauerkraut."},

{"title": "Savoring Leftovers - The Good, the Bad, the Weird.", "date": "Friday, November 29, 2013", "text": "I will admit that, like pizza, I prefer the day after leftovers to the original meal.  I will say, however, that the turkey this year was one of the best ever - the brine recipe I used is a keeper!  I also ended up brining the bird for 48 hours instead of overnight.  One advantage of our present climate is that it is cold enough to make the great outdoors an extension of the refrigerator. I've got the carcass (not mine, the turkey's) in my big stock pot, simmering away with roasted vegetables.  I've got a pile 'o leftover bird waiting a white chili makeover (tomorrow - I've got the day off today).  There was no stuffing for this girl, but there was no lack of delicious food for me to choose from.  And how did the the meal pan (pun intended) out?  Here's a review of my recipe adventures:Turkey - New brine recipe is GOOD.  Basically - two quarts of apple juice (I used unsweetened, natural), one cup of kosher salt, one gallon of water, five pounds of ice cubes.  Dissolve the salt in the juice/water combo, put your turkey breast down, put ice cubes on top and add more water to submerge, if necessary.  I brine my turkey in a giant zip loc bag in a cooler.  You could skip the bag and just use a cooler, but I find it easier to clean everything.  Plus I usually have to transport the turkey for cooking, so it works out much better.  We roasted it without adding anything else, although my sister popped half a large onion and half a head of unpeeled garlic in the cavity.  I am using both in the stock.Cranberry Relish - Last year I made it with fresh, unfrozen berries.  It was better. This year I made it with frozen berries.  GOOD (but better with fresh berries).  The recipe is Mama Stamberg's Cranberry Relish (the famous, Pepto Bismol pink relish from an NPR personality's mother).  It is an unusual recipe but we all love it.  Carrot Mash - A hands-down GREAT recipe.  I will make this often. Mincemeat Pie with Gluten Free Crust - Mincemeat was GOOD (if I do say so myself, it being homemade).  The crust was BAD. This was the first time I have been disappointed in a Gluten Free Mama mix.  It was difficult to roll out, so it ended up thicker than I like.  This made it tricky to bake - and even with my handy silicone crust protector, the edges were toast (and not in a good way) by the time the top browned sufficiently.  I may tweak it a bit, as I have four more mixes.Now, for the WEIRD.  The Gluten-Free and Vegan Chai-Spiced Pumpkin Bars.  Somehow, I missed the fact that they were not baked.   And the reference to \"Vegan\" should have raised an eyebrow.  But I was so focused on the Pumpkin and Gluten Free, that I missed the warning signs.  Once I got over the shock that it was not baked, it still sounded promising - with a crust that included dates, oats, coconut and pumpkin seeds.  However, the filling/topping, being pumpkin puree with no binder, sat atop the crust like weird, cold pudding.  I will not make it again.  Surprisingly, I have loads left.  The chickens will be dining well...All in all, it was a great meal, made more so by the inclusion of family - those at the table, and those that couldn't be with us, but were in our thoughts and fond remembrances.  There is so much for which I am thankful.  I hope everyone had the day they desired."},

{"title": "Monday Musings.", "date": "Monday, November 18, 2013", "text": "This is rather a sad musing tale.The Sorry Drunk in the Trailer House is another one of the sagas I've been following in the 8 years I've traveled my work/home route. Almost to the end of my mountain road - on the to-work end - was a sagging old trailer home. The curtains in the windows were in tatters, the yard was a quilt of bare earth and weedy patches. There was a good-sized Rottweiler chained to the front steps. The inhabitant of the trailer was a character that looked like his blood had been almost fully replaced by alcohol. Disheveled, dirty, he was never wearing clothing that fit the climate that day. He walked down the side of the road to what I assumed was work of some sort. Occasionally, I would see him sitting at the intersection of the mountain road and the main road, waiting. I began to get concerned about the dog when I realized it had no shelter during the day. And no water bowl. And no food bowl. So one morning, I threw a bag of dry dog food in the back of the car, along with a jug of water and two extra dishes. I was a little leery of approaching him (LARGE intact male), but figured I was armed with food and good intentions, so I had a pretty good chance of convincing him I was friendly. I filled the food bowl and the water bowl and put them well within reach. He turned out to be a sweet dog, who was very happy to see the food. I put the bag of food, along with a note, around the back of the trailer and left. This went on for some time - his food dish was filled as long as I provided the food.  I also found out that I had to provide the water.  It dawned on me that this fellow was either squatting or hadn't paid the rent in a very long time and the landlord wanted him out.  Just as obvious was the fact that the dog was there to keep people away.  I am not a fan of keeping dogs chained up all day without shelter, so I brought it to the attention of my friend and neighbor, the local dog warden.  In rural areas, all the dog wardens are pals, so I knew that he would contact the right authority and that the dog would be treated well.(My god.  This is turning into War and Peace....)A couple of days later, the dog was gone.  A couple of weeks later, all this poor sap's worldly possessions were put out in the front yard; a sad little pile.  Bit by bit, pieces of his estate disappeared - free piles are a big thing around here.  There was evidence that he wasn't going quietly.  Each day there was a new day of battle between the land lord and Bill the Barnacle (as I came to think of him).  I think at one point BTB was living in the little shed for a while.  Eventually, though, he gave up and moved on.  The trailer was completely gutted and has had a complete renovation and is very spiffy.  While I will never know what happened to BTB, I do know that his dog got a very good home with a family that loves him to pieces.  A happy ending for one of the pair.*********************Have you ever eaten something that makes your teeth squeak?  I made some lentil/greens soup and decided to put a dash of lemon juice in it.  Geez.  It tasted fine, but it made my teeth feel squeaky.  That got me to thinking about a cake someone made me preGI (gluten intolerance).  It was a very sweet, dense cake with caramel in it.  One bite and it glued itself onto my teeth.  If I had been wearing braces, I would still be dealing with it, ten years later.  I am having to deal with my Onset Winter Claustrophobia, caused by all the layers of clothing I have to wear.  I sometimes feel like a turtle on its back when I get behind the wheel in office clothes, wool scarf, heavy gloves, heavy coat.  I like cold weather but hate having to pile on all those outer garments.  It's the same feeling I get when I have to mix something with my hands and it sticks to them.  I have to wash my hands ever five seconds or I get the heebie jeebies.  Hmm.  I wonder what Aunt Sweezie would have to say about that."},
{"title": "When everything goes to Hell in a handbasket.", "date": "Friday, November 15, 2013", "text": "I was hesitant to write this post - I didn't want to sound all whiny and complaining.  But, really, I'm not.  There are many things involved in this lifestyle that are not fun.  They are not cheap.  They age you and make you miserable and unhappy.  Luckily, there are many more things that make you happy.  If there weren't, we would all implode.Since I have received a few emails from people who are considering venturing into this homesteady lifestyle at middle age, I thought it was important to cover some of the shineola that can happen to turn bliss into blisters.  Pull out the hankies - this is going to be a long one.My particular set of circumstances puts me as a single, middle-aged homesteader - with a full time job away from the farm.  This brings its own set of challenges.  I am certain that, if I had just stuck with a garden and a handful of chickens, my life would have been much easier.  I am, however, not one to settle for easy.  I had decided early on that I wanted to experience as much and and as full a homesteading, self-sufficient life as I possibly could.  Over the years (8), I have raised bees (fail), pigs (fail), sheep (good), goats (bad), quail (fail), rabbits (see quail), turkeys (fail - but it didn't stop me from starting all over again), egg laying chickens (good), meat chickens (good-ish).  I also have Jasmine and Alice, Jersey cows, but I am not raising them - my farmer neighbor is.  So, needless to say, they are doing fine.  They should thank me from the bottoms of their sweet bovine Jersey hearts that I am not all they have.In many ways, it is amazing that I am where I am now.  My biggest problem?  I did not have A Plan.  I may be a list kind of girl, but I am not a plan kind of girl.  Lists fit my fruit-fly-like focus.  Plans mean having to sit down with pencil and paper and look into the future, planning obvious steps along the way.  I am more of a Carpe Diem sort.  That is all well and fine if it's just me and my loyal dogs.  But when I start adding livestock into the mix, things can go terribly wrong.  I am setting myself up as an example of what NOT to do.With me so far?Things started to head south in May.  After having paid way too much for my supposed-to-be-registerable-pedigreed-up-the-wahzoo (whole nuther story) Nigerian Dwarf goats, I had big plans to add dairy to my homestead.  Somehow, I blanked out on the fact that I have two Jersey cows down the road at my neighbors.  Oh, no, I needed the Whole Milking Experience.  So Sage was bred, she had two beautiful doelings, and she came home so we could start milking.  In my own defense, Sage is a pill.  Had I ended up with a non-feral, patient doe, things might have worked out better.  But I did not.  I figured I had about 40 minutes in the morning for milking.  That should be plenty of time.  After three straight mornings of wrestling with the lunatic for 35 minutes to get her onto the milking stand, I gave up.  Threw in the milker.  I still get plenty of nice, raw milk from Jasmine, but now I am saddled with four goats that suck all the air out of the room.Then Kay died.  That had a huge impact on me - not only because I lost such a dear friend, but because she was the veterinary glue that held LLF together.  I'd like to point out here that it is very, very, very important - if you have decided to add livestock to your homesteading dream - that you learn basic veterinary skills.  You'll have to give shots, drenches, etc. on your own, unless you have a good vet and very deep pockets.  I have a good vet, but my pockets are so shallow, they are sewn shut.  It turns out I was double-lucky.  I have a friend who is now my \"Kay\".  And she is not judgemental, which is good, because I am hard enough on myself as is.  She is helping me dehorn the goats and I had asked her to take a look at the sheep, as Linden and Norman limp off and on.  After wrestling with the goats, she had just enough time to check the sheep - it could have been hoof rot, but thank goodness it wasn't.  Linden just needed a trim on one foot, but poor Linden had broken three of his four hoof nails.  This was because:  a) his hooves grew long; b) the ground has been wet; c) I did not check his hooves.  Trimming hooves is Animal Care 101.  I failed the course, and Linden has to suffer for it.  We are in the process of working on his feet, and I am keeping the ground around the run-in shed as dry as possible.Granted, it could have been worse.  But I have been overstretched for some time and it's beginning to tear things around the edges.  What have I learned?  I cannot allow the goats to suck all the time out of my day - then other things suffer (Linden/Norman).  The chicken coop, which usually has a nice pre-fall clean out, has not been touched.  There were unexpected expenses that tapped the emergency fund (apparently, everything in my life is an emergency), savings and future savings.  While it's knocked the wind out of me, I will regroup and it will work out.  But not having had a plan early on set me up for this fall.There.  That's off my chest and I hope that helps anyone reading this who is just starting out not to repeat my mistakes.  Of course, even when you plan everything to the nth degree, there are always surprises.  But that's part of the fun.  Being flexible, having good friends and a strong community, and - most of all - having a sense of humor, can get you through the rough bits."},

{"title": "Put a knife in me.  I'm done.", "date": "Wednesday, November 6, 2013", "text": "Being in a hurry ALL the time, makes you vulnerable to injury.  Listen to this old sage, Grasshoppers.  I managed to twist my ankle last Thursday night, racing around trying to get everything done because I'd gone and allowed myself to HAVE FUN.  That will show me.  I had a friend over for dinner and it was a thoroughly enjoyable evening.  The trade-off, however, was that I didn't get to finish all the chores, so was rushing around in the inky darkness and missed a hole.  Actually, I didn't miss it and therein lies the problem.That put me lame-ish for Friday chores, so I decided to use a personal day to ease up on the ankle.  Is anyone surprised to know that it didn't work?  I know that most of you can relate to this:  sitting inside, reading a book, trying not to feel guilt-ridden while you look outside and see all the things that should be getting done.  Finally, I couldn't stand it and tackled some small jobs.  Luckily, Friday night was Girls' Nite and I was engulfed in conversation, good food and some deadly Apple Pie Moonshine.  Suffice to say, Saturday morning was a little blurred from the get-go.  I had to take Miss Bernice for a shampoo and set :) and was to meet M to pick up pork.  In my logical brain - which is actually an oxymoron, since logic really has nothing to do with how I live most of the time - I would bring B in, wait until she was washed and dried, then meet M and go home to clean before my parents arrived for their overnighter.  What actually happened was that I had to drop B off, then kill three hours.  This is not usually a problem if I plan for it.  But when I all of a sudden get a three hour gap in my plan, I fall apart.  Instead of making the most of the time, I drove to a little riverside park near a covered bridge and drank a cup of coffee while listening to Car Talk.  Fielding several suspicious looks from passersby.Ripped home with B, pork and unplanned grocery purchases just in time to rip out again to store some of the pork in a neighbor's freezer, rip home and clean and....my parents arrived.  That means everything stops.  Which it did, except for my mind which was still racing along.  Then we picked up the same neighbor and drove to dinner - a payback from my parents to this neighbor who has done them many kindnesses.  Back home to do chores in the near-dark and find a turkey on top of the shed.  NO!  I had to hunt down my clothesline prop pole and herd him off the roof into the yard, then get them headed in the right direction and into the coop.Sunday morning was another land speed record of talking to my parents, checking my watch (which I had remembered to dial back - stoopid time change), then gather them up and rip off to the firehouse breakfast.  This is a once-a-month event known not for its food, but for its people watching.  We met another two of my friends there, who more than entertained my parents and most of the nearby tables.  And, seeing that it was the beginning of an election week, we played \"Spot the Politician\".  Then we sauntered back to the LLF where my dad swept off both decks and I started dinner prep.  Their best friends, who are also my neighbors, were coming for an early dinner.  Then everybody left.Thanks to the stoopid time change, I did not sleep most of the night.  I don't have trouble with springing forward, but falling back throws me for a loop.  I dragged myself out of bed at 1:30A and called it a night.  All that ripping around had not helped the ankle, so I just decided to take another personal day.  This time I limited myself and only did some very small things, including repairing my deck railing bird feeder.  The dogs were thrilled that I had been home four days in a row.  I went to bed nice and early, and woke up Tuesday morning to find that Bernice had gone from bouncy puppy to near death.  Again.  I was opening the vet's office with his staff that morning and we ran more tests this time.  And this time we found the cause of this overnight sensation.  A high fever and a baseball-sized tumor on her spleen.  Poor kid.  So we are back to two doses of penicillin a day, cajoling her into eating (two cans of Fancy Feast consumed this morning) and slowly nursing her back to health.  The good news is, it's her spleen - which can be removed.  The bad news is, it's her spleen - which could rupture and cause internal bleeding.  I was thinking this morning, \"thank goodness this awful year is almost over.\"  Then I had an eerie recollection of saying the same thing last year.......dum-de-dum-dum."},
{"title": "Monday Musings.", "date": "Monday, November 4, 2013", "text": "Going along on my usual to/from work route, I was musing on how many years I had passed each of the houses along the spine of the mountain.  There are particular houses that stand out in my memory, and each of these houses has had a story built from the random musings of 8 years.  I'll share my imagined stories of them from time to time.  Let's start with...The Little Old Lady with the Black Beehive Hairdo House.  Her small house is at a bend in the road that let's me know I am getting close to home.  It is as neat as a pin, with two matching, weathered outdoor statuary deer.  When I first was aware of her, she had just gotten out of her car and was moving briskly toward the front stairs.  Her hair was a rigid, inky black beehive, piled straight up - at least a foot - on top of her diminutive head.  It has enough hairspray on it to catch the sunlight and glisten!  I almost went off the road.  I was captivated, and have kept an eye on her house ever since.  Once in a while on nice mornings, she would be seated on her white plastic chair on the small stoop in front of the front door - coffee cup in hand, glistening black adornment on her head.  I would toot and wave and she waved back.  Then I didn't see her outside for the longest time.  Then her car was gone.  Fully a month later, I saw her car there again and my spirits lifted.  But I didn't see her for another six months.  She was sitting on her white plastic chair, with her hands folded in her lap.  Gone was the magnificent beehive, replaced with a short, white cap of her natural hair.  I tooted hello, but she didn't glance up or wave.  I was sad.  She is still there - I can see the lights on as I drive home in the evening.  Her car is gone - most likely sold by the family.  I still toot the horn as I go by in the morning.  We cannot fight the toll of the years, glistening black beehive notwithstanding. Beehive hairdos always make me think about a neighbor on the street where I grew up.  Mrs. S. (we would NEVER have used an adult's first name! It would have been the equivalent of uttering \"Voldemort\" for you whippersnappers) was a hairdresser by trade and wore her hair in an industrial strength beehive.  She also chain smoked and would fascinate us, as she rasped out a conversation, cigarette firmly gripped in the corner of her mouth.  It got very exciting when the cigarette ash was particularly long, and her conversation got more and more animated.  We held our breath, waiting for that ash to hit the ground.  We were so easily amused back then...  Like our family, they had a VW Beetle as a second car because they were cheap.  And both cars had manual transmissions.  While Mrs. S. drove hers like a German tank captain, our mother never mastered the art of shifting.  We clung to the hand straps for dear life as we whiplashed from first to second gear.  So, naturally, when we got into the car with Mrs. S., we immediately reached for the straps.  It always annoyed her.  In those days, and in that neighborhood, all the families were interchangeable.  When it was time for vaccinations, a rotating roster of mothers would load up all the kids and drive them to the clinic, where we sat around the perimeter of the room on metal chairs, waiting our turns.  I hated being last - you had to sit through all the screaming, which made your (well, my heated) imagination create images of bloody needles and evil doctors.  As I've gone through the years, I found that I wasn't far off the mark."},

{"title": "Holy Spud-nik, Batman!  and  It's Not the Size that Matters.", "date": "Thursday, August 29, 2013", "text": "One of the gardening jobs that I checked off the list was to dig the potatoes.  The plants had long gone brownish and flopped over, so off I went down Potato Row, as it is know on the LLF.  It was an interesting harvest.  I buy all my seed potatoes from Wood Prairie Farm in Maine.  They are organic, small, family-run, fiercely against Monsanto and the other Goliaths, and their products (potatoes) are wonderful.  The only problems I have ever had were entirely my fault, or the fault of Father Nature.  So.  As you all know, I plant potatoes pretty much Hillbilly Style - in tires.  I have been experimenting with the Potato Bag and, other than the fact that I actually have to buy them (as opposed to all the free tires I could possibly want), I prefer them - the harvest is the same, if not slightly better, and all you do is dump them over and pick out your potatoes.I tried some new varieties this year, one of them being a trial organic Russet.  Imagine my surprise when I dug up this baby from Tire #7!For extra dramatic effect, I used a grape tomato as a size reference.  Pretty cool, no?This year, the reds did not do as well as the Bliss and other yellow skinned/fleshed potatoes.  The    did amazingly well, producing almost 8 lbs from 1 lb of seed.  To be fair to the reds, they were pretty much neglected this year as the weeds overwhelmed during the endless blistering heat, and the yellows were more closely planted, so they maintained moisture.  That is my story and I'm sticking to it.  All in all, the total harvest from 6 lbs of seed potatoes was just under 15 lbs.  Not bad.  That will carry me well into winter.This morning I managed to get out of the door to start chores earlier than I have of late.  This gave me some time to stand and watch the shenanigans in the poultry yard.  Roquefort continues to blossom into a handsome rooster - he's got his \"Elvis\" almost down, and continues to show a non-aggressive front.  His crow needs polish.  It seems as if he's auditioning - besides the regular \"OffWithHerHead\", there is the \"OffWithHerHead\" followed by a gargle.  Neither is very impressive.  But we have hopes.Then there is Chadwick.  He's the other resident rooster, the Golden Sebright.  Not only was he a precocious little cockerel, but he is not daunted by the size of the hen.  No siree.  And he doesn't waste a lot of time on the \"Elvis\", preferring to get down to business.  And he's fast!  He's given me the stink eye a few times, but is smart enough to realize I outweigh him.  While I was standing and admiring the variety of colors and personalities, Roquefort sashayed into the coop to get some breakfast.  The next thing I knew, he shot out of the hen door as if propelled by a cannon!  Right on his heels was Chadwick, who chased him from one end of the yard to another.  Apparently, Roquefort has not figured out that he is four times the size of Chadwick; who, after making his point, stalked back into the coop.  Poor Roquefort.I just can't wait to see how Chadwick will react when the turkeys (Tiny and Alice and Squeak) are let out to graze.  Should be another interesting day on the LLF."},

{"title": "My dryer died.  HURRAY!  And the rest of my weekend.", "date": "Monday, August 19, 2013", "text": "The mere fact that I was happy to go back to work should tell you how the weekend went.  Friday was supposed to be a day where I got lots and lots done, and had plenty of time to prepare the meal for Girls' Night Dinner.  The best laid plans....I did get to pick peaches early that morning with Melanie, who is going through a very rough patch getting her husband through the morass of the medical institution.  What an eye-opener.  I tell you what - if I ever face hospitalization or any medical emergency, I want Melanie in my corner.  She is fierce.  She is relentless.  She is an amazing force for the care of those she loves.Then I dropped something off with Kay's husband and the half-hour visit morphed to two hours.  It has been, is and will be rough for him.  And all of us.Then I had to get home and whip my dirty house into shape, along with putting together the complex meal I had planned.  That's what I get for being a show-off.  Many moons ago, in one of my earlier former lives, I was quite the gourmet cook.  If the process was French and complicated - I was all over it!  I discovered Ballotine of Chicken and there was no looking back.  Of course, I was younger and had more time and energy back then.  Fast forward to now, and I have less energy and if my time was any tighter it would be a girdle.  Luckily, I still have my special little poultry knife and the original diagrams.  So I (none too) quickly boned a whole roasting chicken (9+lbs) into one whole fillet, which was then stuffed with ricotta, chard, onions, fresh sage, and an egg for binding.  This is then rolled up, tied and roasted, basted with butter.  My original recipe calls for a 'mousse' made with pureed chicken breast, seasonings and an egg for binding; then pistachios and strips of ham are placed in it, it's rolled, tied and roasted - creating a lovely geometric pattern when sliced.  I opted for the fast, slow food option.Dinner was great - then I was up and at 'em to get dinner ingredients together to tote up for my dad's 91st birthday celebration with a few close friends and family.  Then back home.  Then up and at 'em Sunday to reclean the house and get dinner together for my parents and aunt, who were coming down to see the farm.  Then I collapsed.There were a few high points this weekend:  my dryer died.  Hallelujah!  The Ameracauna chicks went into their coop by themselves!  Halle-hotdamn-lujah!!!As for the dead dryer celebration, I have had this dryer since I moved in.  I got it on freecycle and it has run without a hitch for almost 8 years.  I can't complain.  But I don't WANT a dryer.  I hang my clothes out three out of four seasons, with an occasional hang-out during winter if I can.  The rest of the time I use my drying racks.  And I happen to like crunchy towels.  So there.  This means I can pull the dryer out and give it to a neighbor for scrap, then put shelves up in its place.  A much better use of the space.And, as any true homesteader can tell you, having even one step taken out of your evening chores is cause for celebration.  For over two weeks, I have had to go out every night and catch the four Ameracaunas and toss them into their coop.  Every stinkin night.  Last night, I sighed and grabbed my butterfly net and trudged out.  They were in!  Woot!  Now, if the turkeys would just take the hint."},

Dry. Humid. Hot.  Honestly?  If I wanted to live in this kind of weather, I would have moved to Mississippi.Norman - Mr. Personality has passed the Llama Nose Test, Juno is only giving him a butt every now and then, Linden loves him - except at meal time, and he just loves people.  He followed the Lawn Guy all around the perimeter of their fence as he was scything the underbrush.  Of course, it could have been that he was getting morsels from said LG on a regular basis.  He is a totally different sheep than I'm used to.  He's great.Guilt - Okay, I had decided, then undecided, then decided again, then undecided to get replacement turkey poults.  I was driven by a sense that I had paid a lot for these poults and wanted my money's worth.  Then I thought - do I need four?  No.  But the guilt kicked in because the woman who breeds them is a friend and has been screwed countless times by people who special order poultry then change their minds.  This leaves her with an overload that she has to feed, raise and then try to sell.  I ended up with four Ameracauna chicks.  Which I did.not.need.  To add insult to injury, this morning when I was changing their waterer, one of them popped straight up and over and behind the dryer.  I don't know about the rest of you, but I haven't seen the back of my dryer since it was installed - seven years ago.  I had to drag out the stool, climb on top, and try to fish him/her out with my handy butterfly net.  After four tries, I snagged him/her, and brought it up, covered in lint.  I also found out where my sprayer attachment had gone (since bought another...), a poultry waterer and my fertilizer mixing bottle.  So, it wasn't a total loss.All in all, it's been a busy time at the LLF.  Pictures to come.  Honest."},

Trying to find out all I can over the phone and Internet can be like pulling teeth. Or pushing string. Or, of course, my favorite - herding cats. I found one listed about an hour and a half from me. Right price range, reasonable mileage, still available. Then she said, \"Well, we had a large dog so there's a little wear and tear on the inside, etc.\" It's the etc. that got my attention. When she finally sent pix of the damage, it was NOT insignificant. I know that a used car - especially one of such 'vintage' as my budget will allow - is not pristine. Heck, my car is far from pristine. But, really. Ripped carpeting, claw marks all over the interior. I'm still looking.Apparently, deep fried oreos and pickles were NOT the ultimate bottom of the food chain. This year, there is deep fried meatloaf, bread pudding, olives, and....butter. Although I still think that the latter is just impossible. And they've introduced chocolate dipping sauce for the deep fried pickles. GOOD GAWD. I admit, I was a fan of funnel cake (and still get misty-eyed thinking about them) back when I could eat them. But are we going off on a rather scary tangent with this deep-fried business?

{"title": "Monday, Monday.", "date": "Monday, July 8, 2013", "text": "These computer-less weekends are more frustrating when they run four days.  While I can follow the blogs I love on my phone, I have not figured out how to comment and have it go through.  SO, if you don't think I love you anymore - I do.  You just can't hear me cursing commenting in the background.I must have totally jinxed myself by posting my gratuitous poultry pix, because I lost two of the four poults suddenly over the weekend.  After long conversations with the breeder, we came up with:  STUDS.  Sudden Turkey Unexplained Death Syndrome.  Very similar to SCUDS (Sudden Chicken etc.).  I don't know if it was the heat - although I monitored their brooding environment on an hourly basis, but they were perfectly fine at 4:30A when I checked on them and then, a couple of hours later - after hearing more than the usual peeping - I went in to find the largest poult sprawled, dead, in the corner and the smallest followed suit within 5 minutes.  Very upsetting.  So I now have been monitoring them every half hour and, when I hear peeping, I bolt to the brooding room/laundry room to check on them.  Even if it means that I was sound asleep at 2A.  Obviously, not 'sound' asleep.  It's been a very long weekend.Thanks to the high temperatures and equally high humidity, I didn't get even a fraction of my to-do list done.  I went into the garden as soon as it was light enough and weeded.  Waterers got filled 2-3 times a day.  The sheep/llama got their own wading pool.  Even the goats were quiet.I did get a lot of reading done in front of the fan - I am currently working on another Sharon Astyk book:  Independence Days, which I love just as much as every other Sharon Astyk book.  I harvested my garlic scapes and took a short trip to an organic farm with the Ms to cut more.  Then I was faced with pounds of the stuff.  And with my 25 lbs of peaches.  Obviously, I don't do anything in a small way.  I ended up with five batches of garlic scape pesto - approx 20 cups.  Last year I froze it in containers, but found that that large of a quantity was too much to use once open and a lot got offered to the hens.  This year, I portioned it out in 1/3 cup scoops in my handy silicone muffin cups and then froze them, popped them out and stored them in zip bags in the freezer.  I am now set for the year.  I came very close to taking a neighbor up on cutting his scapes, but managed to stop myself.  I made two peach custard pies for the annual Pie ala Mode Cafe event the local library puts on at the Fourth of July Parade each year.  This was the first parade I missed since moving here.  Darn.  But I had to go to Vermont.  I also tried something new - fruit leathers.  Since I have a refrigerator packed with peaches, I pureed them with a little lemon juice and spread the puree on waxed paper covered trays in the Excalibur.  Yum-ola!  I rolled the finished leathers up and put them in the freezer as well.  I plan to do more - just waiting for the weather to cool down to boiling.The garden is going gang-busters and I picked the last of the peas - most of the plants were divided between the sheep and the goats.  I left a couple of plants up to go to seed for next year.  My 500 bean plants are setting beans!  Woot!  Should be interesting trying to find them in that bean plant jungle.  I'm picking Swiss Chard, two kinds of kale, the last of my radishes - planting more this week - my chiogga beets are forming up, there are lots of green tomatoes on the plants, cukes are starting to climb, and I am close to being able to harvest summer squash.  The potato plants are flowering and I am managing to keep ahead of the potato bugs.  By Sunday, being thoroughly disgusted with my lack of progress in any direction, I forced myself to make the new goat feeder and managed to make a good-sized dent in cleaning out their barn before I was forced back into the cool of the house.  The feeder has morphed into various designs and materials, crystallizing into the cheapest one I could managed that I felt would be effective.  I built two wooden frames, nailed on fencing sections, and attached them on either side of the pallet divider.  Of course, Apple got her head stuck within moments, but managed to get it out before I had to intervene.  Thank goodness, the girls are smarter than their mother and seem to have learned that it is NOT a good thing to push your noggin through the fence.  So far, the hay waste has really been cut down.  That, in a nutshell, is what I was up to over the holiday weekend.  Now I'm off to re-read and comment on everyone else's goings-ons."},

(A much-missed resource, I may add - and, in the spirit of her wish for continued privacy, the 'standard' cropped pic...).  That skirt was amazing - I wish I had gotten a better shot.It's a good thing we did nothing but gab, as the weather was horrid.  There was some fluffy sheep petting, graham cracker feeding, Guinea whispering, and I believe that both dogs would have snuck onto the RV and gone back with them.  Bernie positively swooned onto Jane's lap and never left.  The Ice Man was thoroughly snorgled by Scrappy, who thought he was just the best thing ever.  Sophie decided that living the single life in the RV was preferable to the Scary Dogs.  What a beautiful girl she is!We all waved them off with a heavy heart on Saturday night.  Thank you, Jane, Ice Man and Sophie, for making the long trip from spring back to winter - I bet you're glad to be back where it's no longer sleeting.  And thank you for the goodies!  And for your friendship.  My turn!I made a quick trip up to see my goaties and Sage has gone from Tug Boat Annie to Betty Barge!  According to A, she should kid anytime from Wednesday to the weekend.  I sure hope it's twins, as that would be one big kid.  They were happy to see me and Sage seems to be settling down.  A's got all my numbers - it should be an exciting week.  I will, of course, let you all know.  Since I needed to finish at least two big things on my list, I decided to tackle the goat fence.  Plus, I had the fear of God put in me, realizing that they will be returning before I know it!  I took down the 'temporary' fencing that's been there for two years, and paced out the t-post spacing.  Some things I've learned since taking up this homesteading venture:  when you live on rocks and plan to set t-posts, take your sledge hammer and a nice piece of rebar out first.  Do NOT start with pounding in the t-posts.  Another thing I apparently didn't learn was to check to see that I got the shorter posts.  I am NOT over 6 feet tall.  With my pre-pounding method, I was able to set three of the six posts fairly deep.  Two of the remaining three will require a ladder, and the last one may have to be set in the next town, as it seems to be solid rock where I need to put it.  Glad I took some ibuprofen before bed..."},

{"title": "Monday Musings.", "date": "Monday, February 4, 2013", "text": "This morning had a bittersweet start to the day on the LLF, as Bernice, Scrappy and I stood at the front windows and waved (and woofed) goodbye to our friend, Sylvie.  She had spent the weekend with us and it was FUN!  I think Bernice is particularly blue about her departure, as she is very fond of Sylvie, who lavishes attention on her.On my way up and over the mountain this morning, I was musing about nourishment.  Not the big bowl of comfort food that we all covet this time of year, but that elusive nourishment for your soul; your spirit.  There are many ingredients that can combine to bring yourself soul-nourishment:  music, art, books, poetry, family, friends, a vast night sky; six hours of uninterrupted knitting.  For me, at this age and time, I find that good female friends are the ones that fill me with comfort and a sense of well-being.This was not always the case.  From childhood through my 30s and into my 40s, all of my best friends were men.  I did not cotton much to women's groups - probably a holdover from my gawd-awful high school days.  And, because I moved almost constantly - every two years - I didn't hold onto friendships with either sex.  My oldest friend was from my Cleveland days and he was a gem.  We stayed in touch through letters (handwritten ones - remember those?) for years, right up until he passed away a few years ago.  Keeping friendships alive and growing is a real art and takes work.  My parents still have friends from their school days.  They are much better at it than I am.  But do not lament for me!  (You were all getting ready to, weren't you?)  Since I have moved to upstate NY, I have found wonderful friends (not forgetting my oldest friend, Els - who is actually much younger! - who saw me through dark days in a foreign country and is permanently woven into the fabric of my life.)  And all of them are women.Last night, Sylvie and I went to a birthday party thrown every year by two sisters with birthdays a day apart.  This is a special party - by invitation only, a large group of women who have known each other, sometimes for years, who come together for food, drink and celebration.  Most bring a soup, salad or appetizer to share, and there were some amazing desserts - none of which were gluten-free, dammit.  Or whoopee.  It depends on your view.  As part of the birthday celebration, everyone was invited to share something creative with the group.  My first reaction upon hearing this (I was invited with Sylvie, who is part and parcel of the group), was, \"Oh, no.  Not one of those women-things.\"  Well, shut-my-mouth.  I sat in a circle while one after the other of these amazingly fun and talented women read poetry, shared photographs, sang original compositions, and, in one case, unwrapped in front of our astonished eyes the most exquisite piece of handmade ceramics that engendered a full-group - \"oooooooh!\"  I had to be torn away.  Although, in retrospect, Sylvie's timing was perfect - I was saved the angst of those delectable desserts.  The sheer enormity of the talent, humor and kindness in this group of friends was enough to leave me speechless.  And that is saying something.I woke up this morning feeling like I had been transported to a spa, where my spirit had been boosted, cares washed away.  What a wonderful feeling.  I'm sure I'll get over it..... : ^ )p.s.  Next Musings will include a little announcement."},

This soup can be made ahead - cool, cover and refrigerate for up to 2 days. *The color of miso (fermented soybean paste) depends on how long it's aged. In general, the lighter the color, the milder the flavor, so if you have never tried it, go for the white miso.

Long story short, it was the other way around. The Indians saved me. They opened my eyes and showed me what true dignity and compassion was all about.I still have some very passionate feelings and beliefs that I will defend to the death.  While these days I don't grab a sign and go march in a protest, I do what I can within my daily living to contribute to the cause.  For instance, I will not buy anything from India.  I will not support a country that brutalizes its women.  I try to limit what I buy from China.  I try to recycle and reuse everything I can.  It may be delusion, but I feel that even small acts can make a difference.  Earth Day still means something to me.   I also feel that it is important to be involved in the well-being of your community.  I contribute monthly to our food pantry - which also provides monetary assistance to families for heating oil and other necessities.  There is almost no tax base in this community - no job opportunities, the education level is not great, we are in the middle of Booneyville, so people with limited means are almost trapped here.  I am hopeful that civility will make a comeback - maybe it will become as retro as tie-dye and distressed denim.  But, when it comes back in style, I hope it's back to stay."},

{"title": "Tuesday Musings - The Holiday Edition.", "date": "Tuesday, December 25, 2012", "text": "It's a day to muse about traditions.  As I grew up, our Christmas holiday was steeped in tradition.  When we were young, we would go to bed on Christmas Eve, practically vibrating with excitement.  We would be torn between going to bed early so we could go to sleep and make Christmas come faster, or refusing to go to sleep so we could hear Santa coming through the front door (no chimney).  We each had a stocking that would be hung at the foot of our beds - this was, in retrospect, the only way my parents could sleep past 4 AM.  Not surprisingly, I was up that early even then.  Also, in retrospect, my incredibly light sleeping habits must have caused my poor parents to have to out-last me, finally filling our stockings at a wee hour, when I had given up the battle and had fallen asleep.  We would wake up and shriek as quietly as possible, going through every precious object in our stocking.  One year, when I was 7, I got a miniature tool kit - the hammer to which I still have.  We got chocolate coins wrapped in gold paper, a tangerine, socks, and other small, inexpensive items which thrilled us no end.  One year we all got Troll dolls and that kept us occupied for years!Once my parents gave up trying to sleep through the kerfufle, we were herded - wide-eyed (and rapidly trying to size up our piles*) - past the Christmas tree to the kitchen, where we had to have the obligatory breakfast.  My middle sister and I wolfed down our food, while my poor youngest sister, piddled around with hers.  I think the entire experience must have been traumatic for her - there was nothing worse than my slow-eating sister being between me and my Christmas gifts.  Once we had all eaten and my parents were up to their second cup of coffee, we raced into the living room.  But, no tearing of paper and rending of boxes for us.  We had to each open one, then we would take turns taking a present to each of our parents.  Then we had to write down on a list who gave us what for the thank you notes.  And there was no giant pile of presents, either.  We each got a few 'practical' things - socks, underwear - then we would get a smallish surprise and then one larger surprise, and some small things from aunties.  It was a long, drawn out morning and it was wonderful.  After a decent interval, we were sent off to get dressed and then we played with whatever treasures we had gotten from Santa for the rest of the day.Our traditions shifted around as we got older, moved away from home and my sisters had families of their own.  As our needs grew fewer, so did our need and desire for 'stuff'.  My youngest sister moved to the West Coast, and my middle sister now has a challenging job that sometimes (as in this year) requires that she works holidays.  We have adapted by downsizing our tradition to food.  Every Christmas Eve we have oyster stew and a hot, Italian sandwich.  Now, thanks to yours truly, we are shifting again.  The oyster stew stays, but the sandwiches are out.  Same deal with Christmas Day - standing rib roast, vegetable, Yorkshire pudding - has morphed slightly to SRR, vegetable and roasted fingerling potatoes.  Such sacrifice.  :)  As the years have passed, our focus has become more on the fact that we can enjoy each other's company, have a fire in the fireplace, holiday music playing, share a meal, and reflect on the year past.  That is a fine tradition.I wish you all a very, very Merry Christmas - a holiday filled with family and friends, steeped in love.  *Not that this will come as a surprise, but I was such a pain in the butt as a kid.  I would ferret out any and all presents that my parents tried their best to hide until Christmas.  I could have been a professional second story (wo)man.  There was no nook, no cranny that was safe!"},

{"title": "(Pre) Monday Musings. ", "date": "Sunday, December 2, 2012", "text": "Or, what can happen after four cups of coffee by 7A on a Sunday morning - well, it gets me off the hook tomorrow!I recently had a conversation with someone where the subject of smells setting off memories came up.  One of the smells discussed had to do with shoe polish.  Which eventually led me to rummage around to find my shoe polishing kit (charm school : shoe polishing kit).  It's amazing what happens to shoe polish that hasn't been touched for 39 years...  I picked up a new can of Kiwi Brown shoe polish this weekend and, having no idea how inflation has affected the price of shoe polish, actually gasped when I saw the price for a small tin!  I bought it anyway and came home and polished my Danskos.  I wonder how many people actually polish their shoes these days?  Of course, this train of musing led me to remember my neighbors in one of my past lives.  They lived next door and had three daughters - one just a teenager, one just into her tweens and a surprise - the toddler.  The oldest daughter was beautiful and she and the toddler got the lion's share of their parents' attention.  Which left B, the middle rather awkward daughter with braces, feeling adrift and angry.  She ended up in my kitchen at some point almost every day.  I was very fond of her.  However, this particular musing is about her older sister - a more self-centered, limited creature of any age I have never met.  I was there when she, in excited tones, discovered that shoe polish made her shoes shiny!  There was much cheering.  I had to leave the room.  May I interject that B made straight As in school?Does Art imitate Life?  Or does Life imitate Art?  I am thinking of creating a regular feature entitled \"Daze of Their Lives\".  And I'm sure I'll have the pants sued off me.  I am sure you all know by now that I do not watch television and have not for quite some years (aren't I the virtuous one?)  But, really, do I need to when all I have to do to get my daytime soap opera fix is to sit in the Midas waiting room for an hour?  Let me introduce you to the cast of characters:  Older Woman, overweight, cane, car problems.  Older Man, prior heavy smoker, permanently attached to portable oxygen tank (limited supply - clock ticking), various mechanics, trio of women - #1 indeterminate age; #2 20s; #3 teenager, Linda - weekend manager with heart of gold.  Within the hour, the Older Woman opined on everything from toilet paper brands to knee replacements (she'd had 4).  The Older Man rasped out his views on the cost of car repairs and the deficiencies of the medical system.  Linda mediated with #2 who had been sold a car (sight unseen) which they held under a mechanic's lien.  Apparently, the owner had sold the car to a number of people/friends, had collected umpteen dollars but owed over two grand to the garage.  #1 made a stream of veiled and outward threats of bodily harm to the owner, then sidled up to me to say she wished she could knit, as her daughter (#3) was pregnant and expecting a baby!  #3 looked to be about 15 and terrified.  The mechanics zipped in and out with accounts of seizures, dog bites, hunting accidents, and any number of other catastrophes.  I ask you, do I really NEED television?True confession - I had a momentary thought about buying a big flat screen television set last night on which to watch my DVDs.  Luckily, it was just that - momentary.  I do have a terrible weakness for gadgets...The following is a mental clip of my thought process while knitting something (my first pair of fingered gloves!!) out of baby alpaca yarn:  \"Oooooh.  This is so soft.  I love knitting with alpaca.  Hmmmm.  Alpacas are small.  And I only have the two sheep now.  Hmmm.  I think Apria would like someone(s) else to look after.  Hey!  Maybe she'd like an alpaca(s) - it could be like having a little sister(s)!  I bet she'd like sisters!  And the goats!  Hey!  The goats may like having something new to look at.  I think they have been bored.  Hey!  Then I could breed them and they'd have babies and I would have baby alpaca yarn......\"  Thankfully, by the time I had my second cup of coffee, this inane thought process had died of its own accord."},

{"title": "Monday Musings.", "date": "Monday, November 26, 2012", "text": "I have started romancing the Me.  It all started when I was doing a blitzkrieg clean through the house - nothing like facing wind and snow to make you suddenly very interested in cleaning the inside of the house.  I took a look at my bed and realized that I had never made pillow shams for the back pillows.  I guess I figured that I was the only one looking at them and who cared.  Well, gosh darn it, I do!  So I hauled out my sewing machine and imagination (heaven forbid I use a pattern....) and whipped up two shams in about a half hour.  And they are darn nice!  It becomes too easy to forget to treat yourself nicely.  To make your space pleasant to look at just for you.  I doubt very much if I will be dragging out the good china and lighting the candles with every meal, but I am going to try not to slide down that slippery slope....Speaking of romance, I spent most of Friday afternoon standing around watching goat sex.  I had been hanging up my three loads of laundry, trying to make the most of the last lovely day for quite a while, when I happened to look over at the goats.  Sage was wagging her tail like a dog and cozying up to Chickie at every opportunity.  He was not buying all this \"friendliness\" and avoided her like the plague.  I dropped the laundry basket and sprinted into the house -- we had heat!!!  I emailed my friend AnnMarie, who called me and we arranged for her to bring one of her bucks over for a 'date'.  So, there in the last nice day of fall, with the sun shining, everyone - including the sheep and llama, who were lined up along the fence line - stood around nonchalantly while my little baby doe became a future milking doe (we hope).  AnnMarie and I talked farms, goats, DIY, llamas, feed prices, vet bills, self-reliance, and milking stands.  Her handsome little buck, Troy, was in heaven and he and Sage hit it off famously.As AnnMarie drove away with a sleepy but happy Troy in the back of her old van, it struck me that there is much kindness and generosity in the world.  This was the first time AnnMarie and I had ever met - actually.  She doesn't know me from Adam, and vice versa.  She has a Nigerian Dwarf dairy operation - a small one - but she hand milks 25 does every day.  And cares for a bunch of rescued llamas.  She works hard and manages to scrape by.  Yet, here she was, taking a chunk of time out of her busy afternoon for my benefit.  She is also taking Sage and Chick to their own little section of her farm three weeks before Sage is due so she'll be there when Sage kids (and has promised to call me no matter what the time).  She will then teach Sage how to milk.  And me, too.  And, when we're comfortable with it, she will send the Chickie/Sage/kids family home with a milking stand that her brother is making.  For free.  Asking nothing at all in exchange for all of this time and effort.  She knows that I am trying to sell Sage and figured it would be an easier sale with a doe in milk.As bad as things are in the world, there are plenty of good, kind and generous people.  As a matter of fact, alot of them are floating right out there - not so far away - in the blogosphere.  It gives you comfort and courage to know that it's not all bad and it's okay to be hopeful."},

An offhand remark parts the clouds and there is the answer, standing in a sunbeam with seraphims and cherubs flitting about.  I am obviously carried away, or ought to be.  My home phone (land line for you techies) went dead a week ago.  I didn't realize it until that Sunday, when I was madly punching in the number for the gravel pit owner who was operating ILLEGALLY on Sunday (at 6:30A, on top of it all).  Nothing.  I was speaking to my inner ear.  There is nothing more infuriating than being infuriated already and then having your phone let you down.I called the phone company and they sent someone out fairly quickly - two days later.  But everything was fine on the outside.  That meant I would have to have them come in and find the problem.  And pay for it.  I knew it was the mousies.  It's always the mousies.  Or the ratz.  How odd, I thought, that I can get DSL service but no phone signal.  Hmmm.  How odd....hmmmm....how odd.....hmmmm.  I've just given you a little glimpse into the inner workings of me.  Scary, ain't it?  I mentioned this to Kay's hubby at our Zoning Board meeting.  He said, \"then the DSL line/phone line to the box is fine.  What about your other line?\"  THWACK.  Sound of palm meeting forehead.  I went home, unplugged my phone from the other, non-working line, and plugged it into the office line.  It worked.  Then the same wonderful neighbor, Kay, came up with one of those two-outlet thingys and I am now back in business until spring - when I am brave enough to crawl under my crawl space to fix the other line.  Or, maybe summer.  Of 2022.I have a penchant for used things.  I prefer older, used furniture to new stuff.  Old furniture has a history.  Sometimes you know its provenance and other times you can just imagine.  I have two rocking chairs -  one belonged to an aunt on my dad's side, and one belonged to my Great Aunt Edie, on my mom's side.  GAE could knit complicated patterns while sipping her evening scotch, listening to the radio, smoking her one-a-day cigarette, and watching the news, AND carrying on a conversation with you.  She could knit a house and all the furniture.  She and I began the family tradition of making gingerbread men (or \"boys\", as she put it) in her kitchen every December.  As we worked away, she would grill me on state capitols.  After she passed away, my mom and I took it up and have been doing it ever since.  Without the state capitols.  Okay, back to the furniture.  Sheesh.  I would guess that about 99% of my furniture is not new.  When I moved into LLF, I had nothing.  Nada.  My parents, bless their hearts, gave me one of their extra beds.  I bought a used patio table and chairs that functioned as my dining room table and chairs for months.  Then a chance encounter on freecycle led me to a nice woman who came to pick up an extra lock set I had listed.  She looked at my empty house and said, \"Do you need furniture?\"  She gave me a solid maple dining table, two dressers, two nightstands, and a mirror.  All of which I still have.  Slowly, but surely, I have picked up a chair here, a table there.  Lately, I have been rethinking my space and all that's in it (besides too much).  One of the things I'm eyeing - in the 'out-the-door' way - is one of the rocking chairs.  But I am hesitating because of....guilt.  Should I keep it because it was my aunt's?  I wasn't particularly (at all) close to her.  Will her spirit rattle the doors and toss pots across the kitchen if I move it on?  Being a big chicken liver, it remains in my guest room where I don't have to look at it.  What do you think?"},

{"title": "Monday Musings.", "date": "Monday, October 29, 2012", "text": "I recently had a reminder of how much music influenced my life - and how I remembered high (and low) points by certain songs.  For instance, I left the U.S. to live in the Netherlands right at the peak of popularity for Achy Breaky Heart (1992).  Some would say I left to get as far away from that song as possible.  They may be right, as none of the other reasons panned out.  I lived in the southern part of the country, which was more rural and few people in my neighborhood spoke English, let alone played \"Achy Breaky Heart\" ad nauseum.  That was 20 years ago!  Holey Cow!  Aside:  Isn't it interesting that, in almost any country in the world, there is a North/South, or East/West and each disparages the other for one reason or another.  In the northern province (Amsterdam, Rotterdam), they looked down on the southerners as rubes.  In the south (Eindhoven, Nuenen), they viewed the northerners as devious and untrustworthy.  This is a broad generalization, of course, much like here.  And that was 20-freakin-years ago.  But there was definitely a distinction.Leonard Cohen's \"Suzanne\" transports me to the Badlands of South Dakota, the summer of 1969.  Oh, the angst of those teenage years!Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young were the heated heart of my misspent youth.  Or maybe that was Jimi Hendrix?  There was a LOT of music in the heated heart of my misspent youth.  I was winding down to a kinder and gentler point with Simon and Garfunkel.  Art Garfunkel's album, Garfunkel, is just dreamy.  It makes me want to slow dance for a week.Now, I listen to the Wailin Jennys and all kinds of bits and pieces of past and present and new music.  My favorite cleaning music?  Well, it's broken into two categories:  vacuuming (Aretha Franklin) and dusting (Johnny Mathis).  And you should hear me belt out the chorus to Beethoven's 9th Symphony!!  Maybe you shouldn't.  At least the dogs don't howl.Speaking of cleaning, I am now in full Anti-Mouse Mode.  The little buggers are chewing away in the crawl space and I have declared war.  I spent the weekend pulling out everything from the lower cupboards and scouring them.  Then I assessed all spots where the nasty vermin could come in.  Hundreds.  Then I stuffed steel wool in the larger holes and put cotton balls saturated with peppermint essential oil in strategic places along the back wall.  I then took the opportunity to get rid of half of the junk that was in the cupboards that I didn't need, didn't use, or didn't remember what it was for.  They've closed both the NYC and our upstate office in advance of Sandy - I'm holding onto the thought that they are erring on the side of caution in our case and NOT that they know something I don't.  I am very grateful that I can ride out whatever comes our way at home.  There is nothing worse, for me, to be sitting in my office, staring in the direction of home, wondering if everyone is safe.  The wind has just picked up a bit and the dogs are restless.  The whole weekend has had the feeling of waiting.  I hope that everyone in the storm's path comes through safe and sound.  I'll see you on the flip side of Sandy."},

I didn't get pictures of the Bridges because I was the navigator and not the photographer, but it was so amazing to see them through new eyes.  Note to anyone visiting Vermont - skip Woodstock.  Blech.  But, as Navigator, it gave me the luxury of schmoozing with the tourists.  I met a lovely couple from north of Oxford, England and another lovely couple from outside of Hamburg, Germany.  I got to practice my Dutch which is similar to German.  And then I got to warm up in front of the fireplace!  There are some very big pluses in standing around in the cold and damp - when you have a nice fire to come home to, with no worries about commuting to work the next day.Then it was off to South Portland, Maine to visit Sylvie.  It's been a long while since I've taken a road trip by myself.  I forgot how much I loved it.  I forgot how much I loved so many things.  My parents, worried that I would undertake the long trip in Lulabelle, the intrepid Ford (now sporting 205,000 miles!), handed over the keys to their Lincoln.  I was going to have a picture taken of me in front of the car with the caption:  \"Does this car make me look old?\"  At one point on the trip over, I made a quick pit stop and found myself elbow deep in Lincolns.  I was the youngest driver by about 20 years.View from Hog Back Mountain, VT with the GC.Once I hit SoPo (I feel so much like a native), I was immersed in art.  Sylvie and I went to the Winslow Homer exhibit, then to the theater to see \"The Sisters Rosenweig\".  It was all so completely amazing.  And please forgive the overuse of \"amazing\".  'Cause it was.  And is.  There was, of course, the things that warm the cockles of my heart - a trip to the SoPo Goodwill, where I got two pairs of great jeans and a beautiful suede jacket for under $20.  Then there was a trip to Reny's, a department store only in Maine - where you can get snowshoes, toothpaste, motor oil, a housecoat, and 'name' brands for deep discounts.SoPo bay.Rising Cairn - through window at the Portland Museum of Art.I should have scaled the fence for a better shot, but Iwas on my best behavior.Then, of course, there was the conversation and laughter, the good food and wine, and my very favorite BFCF, Grayling.  Three of the four kiddlings - Eli, Ramona and Zuzu﻿ My BFF and my BFCF﻿ That face.  That face.This little foray out into foreign lands was made possible by another friendship - Rosie - who house/farm sat for me and gave me total peace of mind.  And, when I got home yesterday, she had a pot roast in the oven, with Brussels sprouts (she makes the BEST), and baked potatoes.  I mean, how much better can it get?So, now, here I am back at the Little Lucky (aptly named).  Bernie forgave me for leaving.  I have to continue waging my war with the Ratz, who are still among us, bloody rodents.  The Pearlies are still disconcerted that I left and now I'm back.  The goaties are disappointed that Rosie is not here to play with them.  Flora is still Flora.  And squeezing amongst the hay bales, I felt a 'pop' in my pocket - a forgotten egg....  All is right in my world.  I'm off to do laundry."},

{"title": "Guineas Ain't Chickens and What Price Paradise?", "date": "Tuesday, August 28, 2012", "text": "Following all the sage advice I have gleaned from raisers of Guinea hens, I have been keeping the Pearlies in their coop with a screen door for their viewing pleasure.  I have dutifully rattled their feed cup, calling out \"Pearlies!  Dinner!\" at the same time (more or less) every night to train them to come in for the night when they hear the dinner bell (pebbles).  We are four weeks into the recommended six week re-imprinting time and they were getting a little stir crazy.  So I carefully blocked all avenues of escape (and entrance) with a combination of chicken wire and poultry netting.  Have I told you my idea about using poultry netting as a method to get terrorists to talk?  I'm sure I have.  I love it THAT much.  Saturday morning, I let them out into their little run.  And, from my observations over the weekend, Guineas ain't chickens.First and foremost, when I appear, my chickens come running IN my direction from all parts of the yard.  You can almost hear them cry, \"Food, it's Food!\"  Guineas?  When I appear, they run in the opposite direction (\"Run away!  Run away!)  When I let the chickens out for the first time, they spread out and look things over.  The Guineas?  They move in a solid, many-footed mass.  They are never more than two inches from each other.  The first night was a disaster, as only four went back into the coop, one managed to escape and went over the fence into the dark and the other disappeared (it spent the night UNDER the coop).  The next morning, I heard Lonesome George crying his LOUD distress call all around the house.  I left the gate open to the back yard, and tried to get him going in the right direction.  Of course, he ran away - in the opposite direction.  He did finally hear his gang and come back over the fence.  And I was able to get him back in with his clan.Sunday night was even worse, if that is possible.  NONE of them went into the coop and all roosted on top of it.  Another difference in Guinea vs. Chicken?  When it is dark, you can pick up a chicken very calmly and gently and move it inside.  Guineas?  Hysteria at any time of the day or night.  I am not feeling that there is going to be a successful and long term relationship here.  In a couple of weeks, I will be letting them range and will have to resort to finger-crossing.  I hope we ALL live through the experience.The price of Paradise?  Two days and two nights of agony, and still counting.  Last Thursday evening, I was able to spend a lovely evening with a friend I don't see often.  Her home is set on a rise, surrounded by a pine forest, with a lovely view.  She has created an outdoor room that is just gorgeous - fire pit, table and chairs covered in lovely floral linens, flowers in vases, torches for light.  My ex-cat, Bebe (now Smoky) lives there and always comes racing to drape herself across my shoulder vibrating with a happy purr.  She is a wonderful cook and we sit watching fireflies, catching up, drinking a glass of wine, eating good food.  It is heavenly.The next day, my legs started to itch.  I figured it was a change in laundry detergent.  By Saturday, from the tops of my feet to behind my knees, I counted over 60 mosquito bites.  ITCHY ones.  By Saturday night I was having visions of cattle, blinded by clouds of gnats, galloping happily off cliffs to their death - and blessed relief.  I could barely concentrate all day Sunday.  Monday, I was finally over the worst.  The next time I visit that Paradise, I am going to dip myself in citronella, wear socks, hip boots, long pants, a turtleneck, gloves, hat and a full body net suit."},
{"title": "Monday Musings.", "date": "Monday, August 27, 2012", "text": "Walking past the pine trees on the way to the goat barn, I snapped off some dead twigs - and was transported to Canada when I was a kid.  We spent the summers on a little jewel-like lake in northern Ontario in a log cabin, hand built decades earlier by my maternal great-grandfather.  It was my job to take a basket into the woods and gather up the kindling for the wood stove fire first thing in the morning.  I loved the smell of the pine forest and can still take myself right back there, even all these years later.  It was a magical time.   I would go out with our dachshund, Inger, who was a great hunter of squirrels (and capture of none).  She made sure the coast was clear by barking her head off.  I was very leery of bears.  I'd take my basket full of dry pine twigs back to the cabin, where my mother would bank up a fire.  Once that old stove was good and hot, she'd get out the cast iron frying pan and make eggs and bacon.  We would take thick slices of her homemade bread and put them in the toaster basket and toast them over an open burner.  It's amazing how clear some memories are - and how much in between is blurred and unrecognizable.  My god.  I'm becoming my father.  He can clearly remember his grade school teachers, but not what he did in the morning!Most of my life was spent avoiding conflict.  I hated conflict - and I still do.  But, as I have gotten older, I have realized that it is possible to get things done and make your point without having to be toe-to-toe.  It's the subtle approach.  Although I have been accused of being as subtle as a sumo wrestler on a catwalk -- wait!  I'm not sure I like that analogy -- let's say, as subtle as a 2x4 upside the head -- I have become more purposeful in getting my point across.  Case in point:  I am unfortunate enough to live on a road with two gravel pits.  One was permitted before I moved in, so it's a moot point.  The second was slunk through the back alley by an oily character working in cahoots with another oily character and the deed was done before anyone had the chance to raise a holler.  This particular 'pit' is much closer to me.  My feelings about both are not secret.  And, while I couldn't stop them, I can limit them - I believe.  So, when the neighbor/pit started firing up the heavy equipment at 7AM on Saturdays, I fired off some letters to the town board/supervisor.  Not surprisingly, I got no reply.  The town supervisor happens to be a retired corporate executive cum real estate agent cum bus driver.  He downplays the first two and plays up the last with battered hat in hand.  A humble man.  A bus driver.  He and his wife have the listing on the house situated right across the road from Gravel Pit #2 (which is unseen behind a cornfield, and unmarked by any sign other than a large new gate.)  Long story short - the house was owned one of the oily characters who sold the gravel pit property in order to finance a new house at the other (quieter) end of the road.  I am sure that neither he nor the real estate agent (town super) are mentioning the unseen gravel pit to any prospective buyers.  What to do?  I ordered a nice bright sign that reads (on both sides):  NO GRAVEL TRUCKS (no sign) ON WEEKENDS.  I will carefully measure off 26' from the center of the road (town easement) and pound it into my front yard.  Fully in view of any prospective house buyer.  Subtle, no?"},

{"title": "Good Read/Bad Read", "date": "Wednesday, August 15, 2012", "text": "I don't get much time to read these days so, when I do find a few minutes, I want to read something good.  Something that will grab hold of my soggy brain and hang onto it!  Something that will overcome my fruit-fly-focus.  Most of the time, I am not successful (see Bad Read).  But every so often, I come across a book that I just cannot get enough of.  The Good ReadUp in the Old Hotel by Joseph MitchellJoseph Mitchell was a journalist in New York City in the 1930s.  This collection (published, I believe, in 1993) includes stories from the New Yorker and from four books he had published over 30 years.  The stories give you a peek at New York City's crotchety, peculiar, special inhabitants in such a straightforward, but endearing way - it's fascinating!  There's a bearded lady, a child genius, a seafoodatarian (even then!), and an array of codgerly characters.  There is one passage that I was going to include verbatim, but it's too long and some of you might fall asleep while doing something dangerous - like pressure canning....it starts on page 409, if you are so inclined.  I have been reading it at every spare moment.  If you can get your hands on this book, I would highly recommend it.The Bad ReadHow many times do I have to repeat the same poor judgement?  Many times, it seems.  I was one of the early followers of Mary Janes Farm.  As a matter of fact, I met my friends Marianne and Rosie through the forum on her site, some six years ago.  Then, as all things Internet seem to go, she became an industry.  She became a frilly Martha Stewart, an organic Pioneer Woman.  When she first launched her magazine, it was charming.  Then it became cloying and downright silly.  In my opinion (all opinions stated here are mine and darn opinionated I am), her use of the term \"Farm Girl\" has completely lost touch with any farm reality.  Given, there's the caveat: \"of the Heart\" attached to Farm Girl, included, I assume, so that every girl of every age (and with deep pockets and a penchant to gluing lace on everything) can be the farm girl they dream of.  Why, for a yearly fee, you can belong to the Farm Girl Sisterhood!  Geez.  While she did reintroduce handcrafts, and gives \"merit badges\" to her numbered Sisterhood members, paying for it?  Just figure - you hand over $25 a year and get a number.  In order to hang onto that number, you keep handing over money every year.  Cha-ching! MaryJanesFarm.  (I am now stepping off my orange crate.)  I have not read the magazine for years.  I tried to like it - I kept my subscription going but, after a while I just couldn't justify spending money on it.  Years later, along comes an offer in the mail to try it for free - no obligation.  What the heck?, I asked myself.  Maybe they've come to their senses.  NOT.  It is worse than before, if that is even possible.  It is cover to cover advertising and self promotion, with articles designed to disappear into the advertising.  The invoice (which I received BEFORE the magazine) was promptly sent back with \"Do Not Continue\" and \"Not Vaguely Interested\" written across from it.  Needless to say, I would highly recommend not reading MaryJanesFarm Magazine."},

Checked the rat-trap (empty - yeah!) and watered the garden, potted plants, cold frame, and anything else I could think of.  Then the dogs and I took a fast walk (or a drag, in Scrappy's case - he hates flying insects and must stop and snap at them every six inches).  I closed up the windows, drew the curtains and turned on the dehumidifier.  And then drove 40 minutes to sit in the workshop not hearing a word that was spoken because I was too busy listening to this:\"OMG, did I remember the Fricassees?  Did I let them out?  Will they be roasted?  Did I fill the chickens' waterer?  If I did, did I remember to uncap the water access?  Will the sheep have enough sense to go into the shed?  Will there be prone bodies scattered all over the homestead when I get back?\"  Of course, everyone was fine, although they were staring at their waterers in dismay.  It was so hot, the water was way higher than tepid.  So I went around and refilled all of them.  Much happiness and chicken gurgling.  I even took some time to sit in the shade with the goaties and I gave Chickie a therapeutic whole-body scratch.  He loves those.  He is growing a little beard, the cutie.  My boy is growing up!I was able to join Sylvie and friends at yet another bon voyage feast last night.  While I wish her all the best and want nothing but happiness for her, all this \"good-bying\" is starting to rankle.  I mean, I do put on a good face and chirp away, but I really DON'T want her to go.  Just saying.  Full disclosure and all that.  But go she must.  The woman who hosted the 'do' is a very lovely, interesting and talented woman with a beautiful home.  She and I bonded over her bantams while Sylvie's eyes glazed.  Luckily, there were other people there who were not so ga-ga over chickens.  Fools.  (kidding)  I brought a new salad that is now replacing my favorite massaged kale salad - it's a broccoli salad with bacon, dried cranberries, sunflower seeds, red onion and is topped with a mayo/yogurt, agave nectar, apple cider dressing.  Dreamy!  I was very happy that there was some left over so I could enjoy it again for lunch.Today was a repeat of yesterday - without the workshop.  Out at 4:30, sheep on grass, water in waters, water gardens, walk dogs (drag Scrappy), stare at work wardrobe trying to find something cool+professional.  I gave up and just tried to match.  There's lots going on at work.  And what am I thinking about?  (See paragraph 2.)"},

Done some of it.", "date": "Tuesday, June 19, 2012", "text": "Such an interesting weekend.  I have noticed, though, that people in my office have ceased to ask me what I did on my weekends.  Wimpy ones.  I would have told them, \"Processed a dozen chickens, harvested garlic scapes, helped Sylvie move stuff, drove to Vermont, made hummus, made garlic scape pesto, delivered bee ware, delivered 10 dozen eggs to the local farmer's market, trapped ratties, made dinner, pulled pin feathers whilst watching an Ingmar Bergman movie.\"Top that!  Seriously, it was one of my more varied two-days-off.  Luckily, the Universe was smiling on us, weather-wise.  It was a bright, sunny, low-humidity day (both), and there were four of us working with the chickens.  May I inject here that I will never do that many chickens again?  Do you know how many feathers are on a chicken?  Do you?  Well, I do now and it's billions.  Of course, I did completely, willingly and with much thankfulness not witness or participate in the killing part.  And, while I witnessed the gutting part, I did not do it.  I was too busy dealing with the twelve-plus billion feathers and removal of same.  Kay and her husband - a surprise and welcome participant - helped with the plucking.  If it had been just me, I would still be there.  If I was going to do this on a fairly regular basis, I would be the first in line to pony up the bucks for a plucker.  But, I will NOT be doing this on a regular basis.  I retained a breeding group - a rooster and two hens - so that, if I wish for a chicken dinner in the future, I will gather up a few eggs and incubate them.  A few at a time.  All in all, it took us a little over two and a half hours to finish up.  And, by the third bird, I was a lot less nit-picky about the pin feathers (which is why I was watching a dark, moody Swedish movie while finishing the job.  It seemed appropriate.)  Chickens, without their clothes on, are not cuddly and I was surprisingly detached.  It was not how I imagined it to be.  But we know how over-active and fevered my imagination is.  Kidding aside, the experience was sobering and made me very aware and respectful of the source of my food.After everything had been cleaned up and put away, I zipped home to put the birds in the fridge and drop off the huge bag of garlic scapes I mooched off my neighbor, then drove over to Sylvie's to help her move the heavy things into her POD.  There is an amazing amount of space in these things - and such a great and clever idea.  We got some of the bigger things moved in and there was still a lot of room.  The biggest challenge is to figure out how to best lash everything down so there is as little shifting around as possible when the POD is moved to storage.  I am assuming the POD movers are not related to the USPS and will not fling it about from point A to point B.  But, the best part about PODs is that they don't have feathers.I then zipped up to VT to get gas and buy my dad his Father's Day chocolates.  Then I zipped home - stopping on my way to see a friend who is not often home but was.  As chance would have it, I pulled into their driveway at 5 minutes to 4.  Four o'clock being their cocktail hour.  It's all in the timing.  I then spent a very nice hour, sitting on their porch with a glass of white wine while we caught up.  It was very nice and civilized and in complete contrast to my morning.  Then I zipped home, did chores, fed everyone, consoled the surviving three fricassees, whipped up a batch of pumpkin hummus for a Father's Day appetizer, and made a batch of garlic scape pesto.  Then I had another glass of wine and stopped.  If I have a day planned like the day I had on Saturday, I don't dare stop before the end.  Sunday was a blur of delivering of bee ware, cooking, cleaning, and spending a very enjoyable afternoon with my dear daddy-o, mother and Sylvie - who is gracious and listens to the endless-loop conversation - or monologue - of my father while he relives his grade school days, finds her time in France fascinating and grills her mercilessly about her family heritage, background and any other topic that whizzes through his bean while he has her as a captive audience.  I, ungrateful friend that I am, left her there with nothing more fortifying than a glass of iced tea and beat a hasty retreat to the kitchen.So, as the dark and moody Bergman movie dims and bid us pa Avsluta, I leave you with a photograph NOT of chicken plucking, but of a flourless concoction - Chocolate Macadamia Nut Cookies from the latest Martha Stewart Magazine.  Better, no?No flour.  No fat.  No kidding!"},
{"title": "Monday Musings.", "date": "Monday, June 18, 2012", "text": "As I stood in the blazing sun, up to my elbows in chicken feathers on Saturday, I was listening to the conversation wafting about me.  In amongst the flies.  One of our group of four has lived in the area for many years - since the early 70s.  As he recounted the amazing stories of small-town characters, I realized that you didn't have to travel to Europe or even the Big Apple to write the great American novel.  Or even the semi-great American novel.  You could move to our town.  There was wife-swapping, a bigamist who managed to keep two families within 15 miles of each other completely separate and in the dark, a town inspector who left his wife (and girlfriend) for another girlfriend, and a thriving pot growing business on hundreds of acres (finally discovered by the Feds).  It was amazing.  Lately, I have been shutting off all noise-making objects (except my refrigerator) and living in the silence.  Of course, it is seldom silent - there are the chickens, who carry-on like no ones' business, the birds, the wind, my wind chimes, the neighbor's cows - fat, glossy things, the sheep - fat, fuzzy things.  There is the clicking of the dog/cat toenails on the floor.  The scuttling of (bloody little) chipmunks through the gutters.  The incessant back-up sirens of heavy equipment, crunch and crash of machinery and gravel, downshifting of dump trucks as they grind to and from my corner.  There is no lack of sound.  It is ALL preferable to the news.As I was whipping up Father's Day dinner and dessert, I was musing on how all the women in our family approach recipes from different directions.  My mother, German goddess that she is, follows it so closely that she will refuse to make something if she doesn't have the very item called for.  My youngest sister scoffs at recipes and can make amazing things from thin air (or a paltry assortment of pantry items).  My other sister is closer to my mother, but will substitute if pushed.  I start off with the \"idea\" of the recipe, without usually seeing if I have the ingredients.  Then I ad lib.  Sometimes it works, sometimes not.  But I don't worry about it.  Perhaps I should...  When we were kids, and our chins cleared the top of the kitchen counters, my mother started working on us.  Besides dishes (and the endless fights over who got to wash - done first - and who got to dry - done last), she created \"Sunday Chef\".  One Sunday of the month, each of us got to create and cook a menu.  The only taboo things were pricey items (my Lobster Thermador got a thumbs down, as did my Pate de Foie Gras), things she couldn't find in our local grocery store and weird things - like Sea Cucumbers.  Kidding.  Those things are so icky they deserve the gold medal for icky.  Other than that, anything went.  We would spend days combing through her cookbooks (Betty Crocker, Fanny Farmer, Joy of Cooking circa 1943 - which I still have) and present our menu.  My middle sister and I were slightly adventurous, but my youngest sister invented fusion.  Think Swedish Meatballs Chop Suey.  Yes, she made it and we ate it.  But the entire process engendered excitement about cooking and food and a lifelong interest in ingredients and nurturing.  Not to mention, for a few of us, a lifelong abhorrence of anything 'fusion'."},

and haz-mat suit.  All holes were tightly covered with hardware cloth.  Then a nice fresh dusting of shavings and we're done (please, God) until fall.  I also took a half a box of moth balls and tossed them all around the attached shed, or the Rat Haven, as it's now known.  Ick.  Ick.  Ick.  That extra time put the kibosh on goat barn cleaning and building up the fricasees' new digs.  But there are more weekends to come, right?After getting one day straight of rain, we have had nary a drop.  But, wait!  I am now armed with my handy-dandy retractable 100' garden hose!  And I (puffing up with pride) installed it myself.  I dug out my masonry drill bits and my 'real deal' drill and managed to mount the holder securely (and fairly level) to the foundation.  I L.O.V.E. my retractable hose.  I also had one of those 'duh' moments and realized that, since we had now, somehow, rocketed forward to August, the cold frame was a hotbox to my lettuces.  So I stuck in four step-in posts and rubber banded a piece of row cloth to make a shade cover.  That seems to be working nicely.  We will see how it holds up under the severe storms predicted to come our way this afternoon.  After slogging around Monday afternoon in heat and humidity, trying to convince myself that I should start schlepping wheelbarrow-fuls of dirt to the new raised beds, I said 'to hell with it', and came inside and read a book.  It was marvelous.The hose, in all its glory.Makeshift cold frame canopy."},

{"title": "Monday Musings.", "date": "Monday, May 7, 2012", "text": "Why  is it that the people with the \"means\" get things that they want but don't take care of?  This came so clearly to mind this weekend when I went to a Kentucky Derby Party.  The hosts of the party have a lovely home with a magnificent view and the perfect set up for a party of this 'magnitude'.  The mint juleps were superb.  There was a big screen television (oh horrors), an nicely diverse group of people.  But I ended up getting caught up with the livestock.  Surprise?  No, not at all.  We all know that I would rather hang out with the four-footed folks.  But these are two lovely horses who are in a smaaaaall area.  No one rides them.  No one pays more attention to them other than to toss some hay in their direction.  The hostess' son, PJP (he goes by initials, whatever they are), made a loud and grand show of intending to go up and feed the horses.  I offered to help.  Grandiose thanks.  I waited for a half hour and he didn't show.  So three of us went up to feed them.  Here were two lovely geldings (Arabians, I think) in a very small area, surrounded by acres of trails and wooded land.  They have never left their small area.  I doubt if they get any attention at all, save for twice a day feedings.  We pitched in and fed and watered them.  But, really.  Is this enough for horses?  I think not.  I would classify it as neglect.  I was in tears all the way home and it has been eating at me ever since.Let's switch gears before I get apoplectic.  On the way there, I passed our middle/high/school and realized it was Prom Night.  That led me to spend the next few hours trying to remember my senior prom date's name.  I remembered this about him:  he was my first and only blind date (not for the prom, but that's how I met him), he was so drop-dead gorgeous that, when I first set nervous eyes on him parking his car in front of our house, I was sure he was headed across the street.  He had curly black hair, dimples in both cheeks and chin, blue eyes, perfect white teeth.  My mother was so smitten, she would blush every time he arrived.  Even my father - sentinel, guardian of daughters and house, was hooked.  His name was Jim.  He was older than I (which was a Big Deal in high school), he didn't attend my school (ditto), he had his own car and it was sporty (SUCH a Big Deal), and ... he could dance!  Holy Mackerel.  He was a fixture at our Saturday night dinner/BBQs - my dad grilled hamburgers and my mom made homemade French fries (which never quite kept up with our endless forays into the kitchen).  He was old enough to have a beer with my dad - which elevated him to new heights in our family.  Unfortunately, it was a tough time for young men (ANY men) and he was drafted and sent to Vietnam.  After his tour, he came back a fundamentally changed young man, and not for the better.Sigh.  So apparently our local prom-goers celebrate by screeching tires and tossing McDonald trash out of their car windows.  I filled almost a full large trash bag with fast food crap.And I was wondering about the lack of attention to detail that seems to crop up on a regular basis, no matter what the business or industry.  On my commute in to work today, I was sitting a a traffic light, looking around and my eye was caught by the panel truck next to me.  Actually, it was the word \"Hummer\" that caught my eye - it is one of those words that can incense me almost immediately.  It is the worst example of the auto industry, one of the foremost examples of what is and continues to lead this country in the wrong direction.  Ahem.  Anyhoo, all around the truck were painted the cars that this business serviced:  Hummer, Ford, Chevrolet, Pontaics.  Yes, that's right.  P.O.N.T.A.I.C.S.  And it was misspelled six times on the truck.  I rest my case."},

I am at great risk of blubbering at the very thought of it.)  During my dad's two week stint we had a Treasure Hunt.  Oh, great glory, was it fun!  Dad would write up a whole series of linked clues and hide them all over the place.  We had to start at point A and noodle our way around to point X, the spot where the treasure was hidden.  Of course, it would have been a lot more fun if I hadn't been the eldest and the bossiest, but I was and we all lived through it.  My sisters are still talking to me, so I rest my case.  The Treasure usually consisted of inexpensive things that we could enjoy all summer - water toys, things like that.When I turned 21, they had saved up and bought me a brand new Singer sewing machine.  Feeling badly that they had only gotten me one thing, Dad decided to re-enact the Treasure Hunt.  There was just one teensy problem with that - my birthday is in January and we lived in Ohio.  After spending an increasingly frustrated hour, going from clue-to-clue, top floor to basement (he actually suspended one clue on a long string down the laundry shoot, fercryinoutloud!), my \"prize\" ended up being locked in the trunk of the latest Dodge/Chrysler - outside.  And the trunk lock was frozen.  Dad intervened when he saw me grab the tire iron.  \"Game over!\" he said.  \"Kit, put on the kettle!\"  A half hour later, it was mine.p.s.  Why, pray tell, for a person who is fast and loose with \"ie and ey and y\" - Scrappy, Cookie, Bernie, Ropey, Squirrely, Reggie - is it so darn hard to say, gulp, \"Veggie\"?"},

{"title": "Monday Musings.", "date": "Monday, April 9, 2012", "text": "A neighbor, who is an artist and cat rescuer - both professions of which I am in awe - drove by on Saturday and we had a nice chat while she exclaimed over the cuteness of the goats (which has somewhat dimmed - to be addressed in a separate post) and the regal-ness of the llama (no argument there).  We were discussing strays, rescues, purebred vs. someofthisandthats.  She said that all cats are beautiful, no matter what their pedigree or lack thereof.  I couldn't agree more.  I do tend to be drawn to the un-pedigreed, the also-rans, the bottom of the barrels.  There was a point in my 30s where I toyed with the idea of actually going out and purchasing a Cornish Rex cat.  Then I met one.  I am a real lover of mutts, however.  The muttier the better.  Almost all of the dogs with which I have had the pleasure of sharing a bit of my life (it's never long enough, let me tell you that), have been rescued dogs.  Interestingly, three were purebred - a Great Dane and two Dachshunds.  Geez, that reminds me of that Disney movie - the title of which escapes me.  The GD, Riley, came to me out of the blue, just days after I had finished negotiations for Bernie (aka Bernadette).  My sister called me and said that she and her husband's family had intervened with one of his sons who had this Dane.  It had been kept in a crate too small for him to stand or move around.  Something had to be done and I was the only one they could think of who had enough room for him.  In retrospect, I assume they were thinking of acreage - not house footage.  So Riley joined me on Friday, followed by Bernie the next day.  Life with an elephant in the house was very interesting, but he was a sweet, nervous boy, so attached to me that I nicknamed him Velcro.  Long story short - I had to rehome him three years later, due to the fact he took umbrage with a neighbor; I was very, very lucky in finding him a new home.  The rescue organization that I support (and from whom both Bernie and Scrappy came) has a spot on their website where you can post 'neighbor' dogs.  Riley now lives with a family that just adores him and has rescued him a brother, too.  It is a wonderful thing.Sorry - got off the rails there.  I was thinking about people and dogs.  And how there are so many people, still, who insist on pedigreed dogs and cats - which come a great expense, both literally and figuratively.  As D, the artist said, for every pedigreed cat that is purchased, there is one less home for a stray.  While I think that is true in the big picture of things, there are just some people who INSIST on pedigrees.  Other than Dachshunds and Scottish Deerhounds, I am not a breed person.  I tend to think that mixing up a lot of different breeds gives you a blend of all that is good from each.  At least, that has been my experience.  And there is something else pretty special about rescued dogs - after all the abuse, neglect, sorrow and pain most of them have been through (at the hands of people) - they are still ready to love you.Along with the usual cast of 'pedigreed' people, I think there are mutt-type people, too.  People who are quiet and keep to themselves; who are a little 'different'; don't march to the usual drum beat.  In my childhood neighborhood (that grid of a development, carved out of flat farmland), we had a large wooded area at the dead-end part of the parallel side streets.  This was jet fuel for the imagination of a certain tomboy who worshiped Davy Crockett.  (And, if you don't know who he is/was, don't speak to me you little whippersnappers!  And, no, I didn't know him personally...)  In the middle of this island of wilderness was a small cabin with no electricity or plumbing.  A man lived there that we children were terrified of.  Of course, none of us ever talked to him, but our parents warned us - it was the equivalent of the Hansel and Gretel threat - he'd throw us in an oven and bake us for dinner; or so our fevered little minds led us to believe.  One neighbor, Mrs. N., went against the norm and let him get bottles of water from their outside tap, left food for him in a basket, and generally kept her eye on him from afar.  He, in turn, wove exquisite little baskets and left them for her.  We thought she was incredibly brave.  I know now that she was incredibly kind.  Wow.  If there was an \"R\" day, I would have called this \"Runday Ramblings\"!*Inserting note of clarification here: I read this after I had posted it (a little quick on the draw here), and thought it sounded too preachy. That is not what I had meant - there are a lot of people I know who have done both - purchased a particular breed of dog AND rescued a dog or two or five. I am referring more to the people who won't even consider a puppy without paperwork going back to the Mayflower, or who support puppy farms - which are a disservice to both the breed and the poor people who buy from them. And, if there weren't different breeds in the first place, how would we get these wonderful blends?"},

I did have an apple - and used the whole thing)1/4 cup olive oil2 tablespoons unfiltered apple cider vinegar1/3 cup Gorgonzola cheese, crumbled (did not have, used feta)As you can see from the above, just because I want to make a recipe, doesn't necessarily mean I have any of the ingredients called for.  This, however, never stops me.Since I did not have a 'bunch' of kale, but a bag of chopped kale, I was not able to chiffonade them (roll the leaves and cut into ribbons).  I imagine that, using fresh-from-the-garden kale would lend itself to a more juicy, tender end product.  But the process is very interesting:One pound bag of chopped kale and LARGE bowl.Sprinkle teaspoon of salt into bowl of kale.Halfway through the massage.End result.Since I needed both hands for the camera, I couldn't show you the massaging process.  You basically squeeze handfuls and knead and press together.  You can feel the leaves begin to soften and it turns bright green.  It is an amazing process.  After the two-minute massage, put the kale in a fresh bowl.  Stir in the onion, currants, apple and toasted seeds.  Dress with olive oil and vinegar.  The author of the recipe urges you to \"get messy and dirty\"; use your hands.  However, other than the massage therapy, I am not a messy, dirty hands user.  It's a quirk.  You can either get one-to-one with your salad or use a large wooden spoon to make sure the dressing evenly coats the kale.  Add the cheese at the end.  It is even better the next day.  I was going to demonstrate bathing and diapering baby carrots, but I ran out of time.  Heeheehee."},

My pocket knife was taken from me.Once I had recovered, I was grounded.  I swear I spent most of my formative years grounded.  It also cured some of my drive for taking things apart.  A little bit of it.  A very little bit.  I am a slow learner.*May I just say that after I saved up to get this watch (Orient), I was totally dismayed to receive a shoe-box sized package that contains all kinds of....packaging!  It comes with a manual, a tool kit, a fancy box.  I'm surprised it didn't come with an au pair to help it get through daily life!  Geez."},

Tough decisions.", "date": "Tuesday, January 17, 2012", "text": "So far, this winter has been totally unpredictable.  It seems that every phase comes in violently - with high winds and drastic changes.  Yesterday, when I awoke at 5:00 AM (yes, I slept in - sloth that I am) it was -6 degrees.  The dogs made fast work of their constitutional that morning.  This morning when I awoke at 4:30 AM (back to almost-normal), it was snowing and 28 degrees.  Right now, it is very windy and raining.  Wheehaw, Granny - get out the suede chaps!  We're in for a wild ride!  I stand on the deck every morning thinking, \"Shovel or not shovel?  Sand or not sand?\"  I am glad everyone on the LLF has a snug dry place to hang out.And, speaking of the LLF, there will be some changes made this weekend.  They are tough ones for me because I am a sentimental sappy dame.  I know that most of you can relate to the ever-rising costs of food, feed, taxes, gas, everything.  Except, of course, our incomes.  I had decided to put two of my Icelandic ewes on the market, as caring for and feeding seven sheep and a llama, and two goats and a flock of mixed poultry, was weighing heavily on my time and pocketbook.  I found myself doing nothing but feeding, cleaning up, and trying to balance out everyone's health issues.  There has been no quality time spent with my woolly charges - and that's not why I started up all this business.  Why I started up all this business falls under the category of temporary insanity, but I am SURE I had hoped for head-scratching-treat-feeding-looking-dreamily-into-ovine-eyes time.As my life has gone recently, I had someone who was interested in two of the sheep, but they were not able to commit and I finally had to pass on them.  I then decided to put an ad in craigslist for Freyda and ended up on a rapid-fire email conversation over two weeks wherein a swap was formed.  What I hadn't planned was that Hoosier would be part of the swap.  I am very attached to him.  I l.o.v.e. his buck teeth and funny ways.  And his amazing markings.  I was not as crazy about the fact that he is intact and that can be problematic with sheep.  And, when there are no lambs, he tends to forget he is \"protection\" and runs the sheep over getting to the food.  Soooooo.  He, Freyda and Cocoa will be going to a llama/Icelandic/Nigerian farm in Massachusetts and Apria, a female grand champion llama and great guard animal will be coming here, along with a future breeding for Sage to one of her Nigerian bucks and the first female offspring of Hoosier - who I will keep and send Apria back.  Insert large sigh.  The good news is, Hoosier will get to feel his oats and have a much larger area in which to frolic.  I predict beautiful babies.  Cocoa and Freyda will also have larger digs and other ovine companionship.  They will also have each other.  It will be hard on Banyan and Linden, the mammas' boys.  But I am sure everyone, including myself, will survive the kerfuffle.  And I will be down to one llama and five sheep, three of them lambs.  I predict I will need lots of head and ear scratching after this weekend."},

{"title": "January - Get thee behind me!", "date": "Monday, January 9, 2012", "text": "Waaaay behind me.  So far this month: Bernie was diagnosed with Lyme's; same Bernie 'ate' part of an old sleeping couch, which had me running for the Hydrogen Peroxide and milk; my new goat gate broke; Flora, perfectly fine one day, was not the next; my frost-free outdoor faucet (#3 since I've moved here) broke, prompting a call to the plumber; who arrived as I came back from the vet, who told me that Cookie needs $1100 in medical care.  And most of that was over the past two days!Time to do some hard and creative thinking (and financial waggling).  I'm trying to convince myself that ALL the bad stuff for 2012 is getting fit into one month.  How does that sound to you, Universe?It's a good thing I availed myself of some comfort food yesterday (along with the comforting presence of a good friend).  I rediscovered my Moosewood cookbook collection and made a rendition of Spinach Polenta with Fresh Tomatoes.  For those of you in need of comfort, here it is:Spinach Polenta Topped with Tomatoes (adapted from Moosewood Restaurant Simple Suppers)(I don't have the recipe here - but this is close enough)2 cups water2 cups milk1 teaspoon salt1 cup corn grits (polenta)1 cup grated Parmesan8 oz. baby spinach (I only had a 5 oz. package and it was fine)Fresh tomatoes (regular or Roma - approx. 4 reg. or 8 Roma)  *I didn't have fresh so used about a pint of my own canned oven roasted Romas2 garlic cloves pressed or minced2 Tablespoons olive oil1 teaspoon salt1 teaspoon dried Oregano2 Tablespoons Balsamic vinegarPut the water, milk and salt in a saucepan and bring to a boil.  Pour the grits in a slow, steady stream into the liquid while stirring constantly.  Continue stirring until it thickens.Heat the oil in another saucepan and add the garlic.  Cook until golden, then add the tomatoes, salt and oregano.  Stir until heated through and the tomatoes just start to soften.  When they are softened, take off the heat and stir in vinegar.Back to the polenta!  Stir in the cheese, then add the spinach a handful at a time, stirring until it wilts.  When all the spinach has been added, make sure it's heated through, then spoon onto each dish and top with tomato mixture.  You can sprinkle with additional grated Parmesan if you wish.  It is easy and delish!  Bring on the comfort!  And a lottery win would help a lot....I just finished listening to the most wonderful book - and a children's book, to boot.  Any book (or any thing, come to think about it) that Julie at World of Julie raves about always causes me to head in it's direction.  I decided to get the book on CDs, to help medicate me during my endless commute.  Honestly, it was so riveting that I ended up on a few occasions bringing it inside to play on my home CD player!  Part of the cast of characters is an \"unkindness\" of ravens.  That stopped me in my tracks.  And it had me heading for the encyclopedia.  Some group names were mind-boggling:  a \"clowder\" of kittens?  Maybe in China, but shouldn't that be a \"cuddle\" of kittens?  A \"gulp\" of cormorants?  Maybe that's what you'd do if a whole \"cloud\" of them (think \"The Birds\") flew at you... And some were so darn appropriate: a \"busyness\" of ferrets.  I also found that, apparently, some poor creatures hadn't even been considered in a group.  That is just WRONG.  So, in the name of all things equal, I give you:A Hill of AnteatersA Bundle of AardvarksA Fleet of ArmadillosA Flush of FalconsA Mao-tain of Giant PandasA Gargle of GuanacosAn Ick of Iguanas  A Lotto Lobsters (sorry, couldn't help myself!)A Kerfuffle of NewtsA Train of RailsOur family loved words.  We played word games on our endless car trips - the usual \"I Spy\" games with odd spins.  \"I spy something that should go on a sammich\"; or \"I spy the stinky feet of someone with a name starting with C\".  On one unfortunate occasion, my youngest sister, who was quite smitten with pigs, was sitting next to my paternal grandmother who, good-naturedly, decided to get in on the fun.  \"Oh, look,\" she said.  \"I spy pigs!\"  She was getting a little dotty by that time and, actually, there were no pigs.  C punched her in the arm and was inconsolable.  Would that have been a Phantasm of Pigs???"},

{"title": "Monday Musings", "date": "Monday, January 2, 2012", "text": "The very first Monday of the new year!  This time of year, I muse backward and forward.  In other words, I muse a lot.  There is nothing like musing backwards, when one is wearing the clear lens of hindsight.  I will have to say that I have very few regrets.  To me, regrets remind me of Marley's chains and shackles, long, clanking weights that drag you down and keep you from moving forward.  Since there is seldom a way to un-do what has been done, I try to find some nugget of good from whatever sticky mess I've wrested myself and put it in my pocket for future contemplation.  Having a birthday on New Year's Day is a double-edged sword.  People tend to remember my birthday (good and bad, depending on how hard I am trying to forget it!) and I get my birthday off from work (saving myself from the dreadful \"office celebration\").  That's the good part.  Ish.  Ever since I have hit middle age, I have tended to try to ignore birthdays with a vengeance.  This is difficult in a family where birthdays are celebrated no matter what and especially if it's on New Year's Day.  Part of our celebration as kids was to be able to choose our own birthday meal.  If I had been born on any other day, I would have chosen my mom's macaroni and cheese, with carrot and raisin salad and a Hough Bakery white cake with white frosting and pink and green roses.  Instead, I got roast duck, mashed potatoes, baked tangerines, and a plum pudding.  While this might sound just grand, imagine the horror a roast duck presented to an 8-year-old who held Twinkies in a reverential light.  This was only, however, because we were never given a Twinkie!  Put the taboo on anything, and I NEEDED it!  (Unfortunately, this still holds true today.)  But, since we were good, compliant children, I suffered through this yearly meal, harboring a deep resentment towards everything but the mashed potatoes.This year is a rather monumental year for me.  I have hit a milestone that I could never even contemplate even five years ago.  Call me Cleo, Queen of DeNile.  But I am taking a different tack this year.  I am embracing it!  I am rolling in it, glorying in it, giving it a big warm hug!  I am LYING!  I really just got worn down with everyone wanting to know what I was going to do to celebrate - offering me all kinds of advice, and not even letting me contemplate what I had originally wanted to do.  Which was nothing.  Nada.  Zip.  So who started all this birthday celebration nonsense anyway?  Hallmark?  Sara Lee?  Duncan Hines?  I'd like to have a little tete-a-tete with the guilty party.Quite frankly, I am my most stressed on New Year's Eve.  For some reason, every year on that day, I want to slam on the brakes and go backwards.  I panic about the year being forever lost.  Then I get over it because I can't stop it, wacky doodle that I am.  Another big plus, in my book, is that I can finally relax and enjoy winter (remind me I said that when I'm up to my knees in snow and ice) and the respite it brings.  I could never contemplate NOT having this break - even for all the cold and snow and ice.  Thanks to the generous nature of my friends and neighbors, I am pretty much ready for it this year.  I have lots of things to do inside - and some of them are actually fun!  Can I stand it?  You betcha."},

That experience deserves a separate post.Since I was running around with my camera - here's more evidence...The New and Improved Goat Gate (with triple bungee closing, thanksto Chickie's discovery that he can push it open with one bungee)Run In Shed - partially sided.  The facing boards need to be trimmed.So there you are.  The evidence.  I now have to pull on my Carharts and muster the courage to tackle the 6 plus inches of snow that was predicted as a \"light covering\".  It's Woman and Snow Wolf against the elements!"},

(I bet you thought I had lost my train of thought!)  and, while my sisters were easy - Con, Cynth - he seemed to have a problem with shortening my name to something he liked.  I ended up as \"Sweeze\".  That has stuck with me for years.  I am either Sue, Susan, Susie (my parents' call me Susie), Sweeze, or Sweezie.  A person could get confused!Where did the name, Bubba, come from?  Or Boo?  Boo Who? (Sorry.)  I can see \"Chip\", as in \"Chip off the old block\".  But, Bubba?   Pinky?  My father's father detested nicknames.  That's why he named my father \"George\".  Can't do much with that.  He also refused to give him a middle name.  I don't remember my paternal grandfather, although he was living when I was born.  I bet he was a stinker.  Stinky?  My mother's name is easily given over to many different nicknames: Kathryn.  Kat, Kathy, Kath.  She goes by Kit.  Then there's Charles.  Or Charlie, Chas, Chuck.  That reminds me of the song, \"The Name Game\".  (Fogy-ism)  I used to love that song and tried it out on everyone and everything I came across, until I drove everyone crazy.  It still pops into my head every now and then.  If I had been allowed to choose my own name, I would have chosen \"Imogene\".  The clouds part, birds sing and I can hear guitars strumming in the distance when I say that name."},

I used to date a fellow way back in the dark ages who had a young son.  He was the first single father I had ever met.  His son, K, used to refer to woodchucks as \"ground chucks\".  It was very cute.  Now that I have a garden, I think he was spot-on.  Ground chuck indeed.  He also used to belt me in the shoulder every time he spied a VW Beetle.  And, unfortunately, they were a hot item back then.  Not so cute.Why is it a \"pair of pants\"?  I mean, it is one garment.  But it sounds odd when you try to make it single.  I just put on my pant.  Makes you think of a hot dog in summer.  And using another term doesn't make it sound any better - I am wearing my \"slack\".  Unfortunately, I always wear my slack.  Gravity has struck!  Could it be changed to:  \"I am wearing my panting\"?  \"My slacking\"?  How about a description based on closures:  I am wearing my elastics.  I am wearing my snap-fronts.  I will just pull on my zip-ups.  Hey - I am making it plural again!  It's hard to change something that's been set in stone.  I guess I will continue to pull on my zip-up pants in the summer, and slip into my elastic slacks in the winter.Speaking of platform shoes (hold onto your horses, kids - it's Fogey Time), my absolute favorite shoes of all time - and that's saying something, although I hold boots in esteem in their own category - were a pair of platform shoes right out of Disco-rama, before Disco-rama.  And I don't want to hear from any of you young whippersnappers asking what Disco was.  They had almost fluorescent pink rubber platforms and heels with silver sparkly things mixed in.  They had to be a good 2-2.5 inches high.  The body of the shoe was in a Mary Jane style, in a stiff linen-like fabric with a wild floral design.  Oh, baby, these were smokin' shoes!  And I used to wear them with hot pants.  Oh, yeah.  Of course, the idea, now, of me in hot pants would make me run for the Pepto-Bismol.  The real question here is, though, would I pull on my zip-up hot pants?  It wouldn't do to slip into my elastic hot slacks, would it?  Come to think of it, that would be rather nice in the winter."},

I mean....really.5.  If you think you're the biggest, punkiest kid in your grade school class, be careful not to abuse the power.  Everyone you push around will have a growth spurt after you have stopped growing and out-weigh you by 50 lbs.  Payback is a BIODIESEL!It's a given that, living alone, I would succumb to talking to myself.  Or my dogs.  Or my cat.  Or my car.  Once, when I was in my 20s (this should give you an idea of how long I have been, \"musing\") I went four days without speaking.  It wasn't easy.  But, when I finally said something on the fifth day, my voice sounded strange - sort of loud and recorded.  It was an interesting experiment, but I prefer to talk non-stop to my dogs.  Sometimes in Caninese - blah, blah, blah, blah, FOOD, blah, blah, blah, blah, SQUIRREL.  There are many of us who do this, if you are totally honest with yourself.  I believe that Felinese is totally different:  hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.  That's because they do not listen to us at all.  They don't care what we say, how we say it, or what we mean.  We are there to proffer food and clean litter pans.  Don't get any uppity ideas with cats.Spending most of my prior adult life as an apartment dweller, I was always desperate for livestock.  So, whenever possible, I would house the most exotic thing I could find (that was non-six-legged, non-slithery, and non-furry in a creepy way) in my living room.  Besides a delightful array of cats, I had fish, hermit crabs, turtles, Chinese button quail, and a skunk.  This was usually without the knowledge of my landlord, which was not often a problem since, being an art student, my apartments were not the type that were often visited by the landlord.  I would rate the early ones as just a half-step up from a tenement.  I did love that skunk, though, even if he carried with him the slight aura of eau d'peuuw.  But he was not fond of strangers and would bite me if he got alarmed.  Which was often -- and painful.  I finally had to take him back out of a sense of self-preservation.Segue into my last semi-tenement apartment in Cleveland Heights.  I was in my third year of art school (and unknowingly my last, as the school suddenly went bankrupt and closed), living in a one-bedroom apartment that would have given a NYC studio flat a run for it's money, size-wise.  It came furnished.  There was a chair upholstered in avocado green plastic, with a matching sofa.  This sofa was the most unusual piece of furniture -- when you sat in it and leaned against the back, you were left looking up towards the ceiling.  And it was designed that way!  I also had a linoleum covered table, two chairs, and a platform bed without the platform. I think I paid $150/month rent. There were a lot of classmates in that building and, since none of us had two nickels to rub together, we would pool our money for meals and I would go out and buy the food and cook it.  Invariably, we ate spaghetti and red sauce.  And drank from gallon jugs of Gallo wine.  We never got schnockered because we could only afford one bottle a week and there were a lot of us.  As I cooked the pasta for these almost-daily meals, I would throw a noodle against the wall to see if it would stick.  If it stuck, it was al dente.  Long story not short enough, after about a year and a half, the landlord decided to go upscale and we were all thrown out.  Our parting gift was to frame the spaghetti painting on the wall and all sign it.  It's probably worth millions now."},

Wha' weekend?", "date": "Tuesday, November 8, 2011", "text": "Nothing like having house guests from Friday night to Monday morning to make the weekend vanish into thin air!  I, of course, had forgotten that the fiber fest they were part of was a two-day affair.  Sigh.  At least I got to try out some new recipes and all were big hits.  Friday night, I made my favorite pulled pork recipe - from Sylvia - that is so completely idiot-proof that it's impossible to get it wrong.  All you need is:  a crockpot; a large onion chopped; a boneless pork roast or tenderloin (mine was about 3.5 lbs), one bottle of beer, one bottle of your favorite BBQ sauce, two minced garlic cloves, and salt and pepper.  Put all ingredients in your crockpot, turn it on low and let it go for 10 hours.  Voila!  Haul out the pork, pull it apart with two forks and put it back in to heat through.  I served it with homemade coleslaw and pumpkin cornbread.  Everyone had seconds of everything - 'though I had to abstain from the cornbread.Saturday was dealing with another long list at the folks', a trimmed-down version of my Saturday chores, then home to make dinner number two - roast chicken with pomegranate molasses, mashed cauliflower with cheddar cheese, oven roasted Brussels sprouts and chunky apple cake for dessert.  I did put on my big girl pants and have a small piece of the cake (how could I NOT????)  Those pants were awfully uncomfortable later, but it was worth it, I tell you.Sunday I was less adventurous -- I did have to get some things done around the homestead -- and made a big pot of soup with grilled cheese sandwiches, and leftover cake  for them with vanilla ice cream - for me - for dessert.  I sent the rest of the cake home with them out of self-defense.  I forgot to send the pumpkin cornbread with them, so the chickens will be happy with their treat tomorrow, ungrateful beasts.  Some heartening news, in a back-handed way:  their chickens are not laying a single egg, either.  First time it has happened to them, too.  Misery loves company.It was so much fun to be able to have rousing conversations into the night!  Sheep!  Dogs!  Fiber!  Heaven! I spend so much of my time at home alone, that I was almost sad to see their visit end.  Almost.  I am very much looking forward to coming home tonight and NOT having to make dinner.  Scrappy, in particular, will be very disappointed when Frances and Suzy do not show up tonight.  They spoiled him rotten.  They cooed over him, petted him, fed him from the table.  Bernie is shyer, so only managed to get half of the loot that he did.  Scrappy is anything but shy.  He is Velcro Dog; Bert Lahr in a Dog Suit; he is ON FIRE!I was able to check a few things off my list(s), got my laundry done - we all laughed at my frozen jeans on the line Sunday morning - and Flora seems to be coming along.  Of course, I was told that my sheep are fat.  Geez, it's like being called a bad mother.  So, now, they are all on a diet - including the portly little goats.  And my name is Mud as far as the livestock are concerned.  Work on the run-in shed is inching along.  I spent a good two hours trying to get the ding-dang lattice house apart - I had forgotten that Melanie and I had reinforced the thing to within an inch of its life.  As I have been trying to watch my language - as 'empowering' as it may feel, swearing shows a lack of vocabulary (or so I tell myself) - so loud exclamations of:  \"CATERPILLAR!!\" and \"MOLASSES!!\" and \"DARN RUDBECKIA!!\" were heard up and down the road.  I'm sure my few neighbors think I have finally gone over the edge.   The upside of my new colorful language is that it is so absurd even to me, that I end up laughing and that always puts me in a better mood and makes the job easier.  End result of 2 hours of wrestling with the lattice house?  Me: 1  LH: 15.  But I'm gaining on it~by cracky."},

At least I can see it and reach it. Another of the joys of singlehood - tick checks and itches in awkward places. Thank goodness for those little bamboo scratchers - China be damned. TMI? I'll say...The coyotes are back. All 100 of them. Since my go-around the last time, I realized that the little sissy-pants \"pop\" of my .22 does nothing but earn their scorn. I've since discovered that my 1.5 qt., heavy-bottomed saucepan, delivered with some force, flat-bottomed to the top of the deck railing, has an amazingly gun-shot-like sound that really gets everyone's attention - and it carries! I wonder if it comes with a holster? Of course, this will now segue into a childhood memory. We left off with my casting aside my black patent leather MaryJanes for a terminal case of horse love. I had horse models - my favorite was a rearing Palomino with \"flowing\" plastic mane. OMG, did I love my horse models. There were three girls in our family, of which I am the eldest. And the bossy-est. Just ask them. Our family was typical of the day - father worked, mother worked in the home, kids toed the line. We did not have a lot of extra money floating around, so we had to take turns when it came to extracurricular activities. I took tap dance classes, then my middle sister took ballet (she WAS graceful), etc. Luckily, my youngest sister was too small to take any classes, so my MS and I were able to double-up for a while. After an endless stream of histrionics, melodrama, moping, and whining, my parents signed me up for horseback riding lessons. Oh Heavenly Day! My father took me to get fitted out with riding gear. I had no interest in English riding, oh, no. I was going to be a cowboy. I came home with powder blue jeans, a matching Western shirt in powder blue and peach plaid, resplendent with pearl-covered snaps, a gen-u-ine cowboy belt with a BIG buckle, and boots. If I had been allowed, I would have had that outfit sewn onto my body and would have worn it until it fell off in tattered shreds.  I had even managed to talk my father into the piece d' resistance - a bolo string tie with fake turquoise decoration.  I was so amazing I couldn't even stand myself!Fast forward to now.  I was standing in line at the hardware store recently, fishing around in my pockets for change.  I came up with:  a sticky nickel, a pile of goat treat crumbles, a Christmas hanky, a sticky piece of baling twine, and a balled up receipt for something - too sticky to tell.  All that stickiness had to come from something - I cannot, for the life of me, remember what sticky thing had been in my pocket.  While I was rifling my pockets, I happened to focus on the front of my zip-up sweatshirt.  Mistake #1.  That led to looking down at my feet.  Mistake #2.  Which sent a chill through me, as I realized I had not looked in the mirror since 4 a.m. that morning.  And it was a glancing look in the dark - which, of course, doesn't count.  I realized that I had left the house and gone *gasp* out in public wearing manure covered muck boots, jeans that had been dragging through the wet muddiness of the farm and had wicked up same clear to my knees, a sweatshirt that had been in almost continual use for half a week, and my sun-bleached, sweat-stained, battered Vermont ball cap.  Oh, how charming.  And I wonder why I'm single?"},

if I even think someone might be thinking about tickling me, I fall apart.  Yet, if I try to tickle myself - nothing.  nada.  It's sort of like the difference between washing my hair myself, or going to the hairdresser (or, should it be \"stylist\"?  I'll have to ask Mary which she prefers) and having her wash it.  It feels so different.  Many years ago, on a faraway island (not far away enough, though) in another life, I used to get my hair cut in Chinatown.  Of course, you know by now that I have always been, um, frugal.  On that island of $100+ haircuts, I got mine cut for $17, PLUS a shiatsu scalp massage.  Holey moley.  It was heaven.  I am sure I was snoring and drooling at the end of the wash, but I didn't care.  And it was a great haircut to boot.Why does the wind bother me so much?  At any sign of a good gusting, I start to get anxious.  Wind at night will keep me from sleeping.  It kicks in my worry gene big-time.  I start to think of the pioneer women who were out on those lonely, windblown prairies, stuck alone in their sod houses in the inky dark with their children, while their husbands were off.  The ones that survived were certainly made of sterner stuff than I;  I would have folded like a sheet.  I used to work in a high rise on the same island as referenced above, on the 38th floor.  When the wind blew, you could feel the building move.  This was years before 9/11.  Now, I work on the 7th floor and I ain't goin any higher.  I can handle the stairs.My favorite cartoon character was and has always been Bugs Bunny.  He was a smarty-pants and it gave me a little thrill as a child to see how he always managed to out-maneuver Elmer and everyone else.  Years later, it seemed like he was created for adults, not children.  Every so often, my dad and Uncle Jim (on my mom's side - we used to call him Uncle Mimmy) would drive us to the Saturday matinee - I won't tell you how much it cost (for the day) since then you will think I am a fogey.  Once in a while, they would stay for the show.  If there was a Bugs Bunny cartoon between features (it was a double-header), the two of them would sit and roar with laughter.  It was completely embarrassing for us - we usually managed to edge down the row a few seats, trying to look like we weren't with them.  This was an old movie theater, with a stage and a piano to one side of the audience.  When I was very young, I took tap dancing lessons there, from an old Vaudeville dancer.  His wife played the piano.  After having been turned down by the ballet teacher (as \"too clumsy\" for the delicate art of ballet), I got my revenge by tap-dancing my way to a solo performance.  I even remember what I wore:  black patent leather MaryJanes, white ankle socks with lace trim, a short, red cotton skirt with bloomer pants (modesty was the name of the game) with matching suspenders, and a white short puffed sleeve blouse.  Not a sequin in sight.  But, I was the cat's meow - the bee's knees - I was going to the TOP!  Look out, Fred Astaire!  Then I discovered horses.  The end.This weekend, on Saturday late morning, to be exact, my friend Sylvie's sweet Golden Retriever went missing.  Grayling is so true to her breed, she should be the poster child for GRs.  She NEVER wanders off and Sylvie lives in a heavily wooded, mountained area, so tracking her is very difficult.It would be greatly appreciated by me, Sylvie and Grayling, if you would all send a prayer, good thought, or message to the Universe for her safe return.  Sylvie is - as is no surprise to those with beloved pets - missing her something terrible.  As are all of us who love Grayling.Thanks so much."},

{"title": "Community Service can be Loud!", "date": "Friday, October 21, 2011", "text": "Twice a year, our town offers a rabies clinic with $10 rabies and distemper shots for both cats and dogs.  The service is open to anyone and we often get pet owners from other counties and sometimes from other states.  It's organized by our town dog warden (aka, my dairy farmer friend) and the vet volunteers her services and the serum (aka, my sheep vet).  It is held in the Highway Department garage.  And it almost always rains.And, twice a year, I volunteer to help process the cats and dogs that come through -- and my friend, Kay, volunteers to work with the vet, scruffing, holding, soothing, or whatever else needs to be done to the highly excited/anxious felines and canines (and their people).  It's a great community service, we've all gotten to be a chatty group over the years, and it's a good way for people to license their dogs as well - the Town Clerk is always a volunteer.We divide the night into first hour: cats and second hour: dogs.  This doesn't always work seamlessly - there are stragglers, people seldom pay any attention to the hours posted, and occasionally a cat makes it's escape and there's a general melee as we try to get hold of it.  Usually someone has to volunteer their jacket as a net.    And 'jacket' is the key here.  The garage is comprised of cement and metal.  There is almost no heat, the lighting is gruesome and don't even ask me about the acoustics!  Fall or Spring, it's cold and damp.  Last night was the fall clinic.  And, right on cue, it was raining.  The cats and their owners straggled in (there were some amazingly cute kittens!) and there was one escape attempt.  Other than that, it went smoothly.  We can't see outside, but it's pretty evident when the dogs and their people start lining up.  Once we've processed all the cats, we all take a deep breath, syringes are filled, pens are poised, the door is opened and the dogs burst in.  From then on, it's complete chaos.  We yell questions at the owners, the owners yell back the answers.  Dogs hoot and holler, yip and yap, boom and squeak.  Some years we have a lot of small dogs (that's hardest on your ears) - this year we had a lot of hounds.  I don't think I need to elaborate on their particular vocal patterns.  I had to abandon my tablemates before the end, as there was a Zoning Board meeting that conflicted with the clinic.  I actually hated to go.  It's fun to see the dogs and meet neighbors.  When they've all been run through the gauntlet, the silence is deafening and you can sink back in your wildly uncomfortable metal chair in a state of happy exhaustion, then go home and appreciate the relative sanity of your own menagerie.*******The weather forecast for the weekend is brisk but mostly sunny.  That's my kind of weather!  Top-most on the list/s this weekend is starting the run-in shed and rebuild of the greenhouse enclosure.  (You can probably hear me laughing all the way out your way!)  Don't forget to leave a comment for the Apron/Apron Book giveaway!  Winnah announced on Monday!﻿﻿"},
{"title": "The trouble with timers.", "date": "Thursday, October 20, 2011", "text": "My preparations for winter are very involved.  Over the years, I have worked to make my life easier during the winter, but it is a long and complicated process, nonetheless.  I have come to rely heavily on timers.  And extension cords.  As a matter of fact, once winter gets a full head of steam, my house resembles an octopus - with extension cord tentacles curling out from both sides.  On one side of the house are the chickens/ducks.  I provide them with heated water all winter.  This ensures they always have water to drink and it means I don't have to go out every morning and chop through ice.  When it gets really, really cold, I add a light for a little bit of heat.On the other side of the house are the sheep, llama and goats.  I also provide a heated water source for the sheep, and now have the goats with their own needs in the barn.  And then there is the problem of light.  Or lack thereof.  Now, by the time I get home, it is almost dark.  My front door is a distance from the driveway and it can get pretty dicey navigating the rough terrain.  I have on my wish list a spotlight that will hit the drive and the chicken yard that is set off by a motion detector.  But anything involving electrical work is mucho expensive, so on the wish list it will stay for a while.  My cheap and colorful answer to lighting my way involves a timer and orange twinkle lights.  It works fine, I use LED lights so they are more economical, and I can regulate it with a timer.  I also have a timer in the living room so that the house is illuminated when I get home and the dogs are not left in the dark.  I also have a timer for a light in the barn so the goats are not left in the dark and I can see to feed them and get the hay for the sheep when I get home.  Two years ago I invested in an outdoor spotlight that I can flip on from the house that illuminates most of the sheep paddock.  It also makes a good coyote deterrent.  But it was expensive to have installed, and expensive to run.  It's only on for about an hour and a half every night.  Just long enough for the eating machines to munch their way through their hay.Goodness!  I've rambled on forever without getting to the point of my title!  How odd! (not).  Yesterday, we had a weather front come through and with it, high winds and rain.  This resulted in - not surprisingly - a power outage.  Of course, I was snug in my office during all this drama, and didn't have a clue that the lights had gone out at home.  By the time I got home, it was still blowing rain sideways and it was dark.  I mean, dark EVERYwhere.  The house was dark, the barn was dark.  I can't tell you how much fun it is to go out with your headlamp on (but without my glasses, of course) to try to fathom how to reset the timer in the barn.  The goats were sticking closely to my legs during the whole process.  I don't think they cared for the dark, either.  I finally got the light on and the timer reset.  Then I had to go inside and reset those timers.  And the nine million digital clocks.  I don't reset the microwave because I don't use it.  As a matter of fact, it's on the heave-ho list.In my Perfect World, I would have power run to all the outbuildings, have it powered by alternative energy sources, and have someone home to take care of it while I commute back from work.  Since my Perfect World is a place far, far, far away, I will juggle my timers and  enjoy my twinkle lights!"},
{"title": "The weekend revisited.", "date": "Tuesday, October 18, 2011", "text": "Savoy cabbage bought at the Farmers Market.Isn't it beautiful?Such a chaotic weekend - I was thither and yon both days.  So was the weather.  Mostly thither, I think.  Saturday I had a long list to work through at my parents', then had to race back to get the barn re-reorganized for my 100 bales of hay (oh, yeah!!!)  My farmer/neighbor picked me up in his new-to-him 1978 truck with a box body and we clacked, clanged, chugged and alternately screeched, jerked and shimmied up the mountain to get the hay.  The engine/exhaust system was so loud we had to yell at each other.  But we made it.  Thankfully, the rain held off long enough for us to toss the bales into the truck, then shimmy, etc. down the mountain, where we stacked all those lovely bales floor-to-ceiling.  I kept opening the door and looking in.  I had to pinch myself!  There is nothing like a nice stock of hay to make the world seem brighter.  And thank goodness I had help stacking.  I am good to stack four-high, but the farmer can heft those babies up six-high!  Even the little goats were appreciative of the added warmth a barnful of hay bale provides.  They have their little Dogloo to sleep in, but the hay helps temper the noise of rain on the metal roof.While I was waiting to be picked up for the hay ride, I got two raised beds weeded, hoed and raked - ready for garlic planting.  I also started on the mat of weeds that had overtaken my tomato/herb bed.  I left the parsley plants because they were so healthy, although I might have to cover the bed if the temps drop as they are forecast to do later this week.  I squeezed garlic-planting in on Sunday morning - with my high-tech, surefired planting method - broomstick marked at 3\".  I still have room, so I am on the look-out for more seed garlic.  So far, I've planted seed garlic from Marianne (it was so big, it was mistaken for Elephant garlic - llama beans!!!), my saved seed garlic from this year's crop, Keeper from The Garlic Store, and Susanville (how could I NOT plant that?), also from The Garlic Store.  Susanville is a softneck variety, while the others are all hardneck.  I'd like to plant the rest of the bed and another third of the second, leaving the rest of the second bed for onions.  I still have to mulch it and I wanted to plant spinach, but ran out of time, light and opportunity.  On Sunday, I drove up to Melanie's, where she had generously offered to help me fill buckets full of apple drops from their trees for the sheep (and me).  She has had an amazing apple crop!  I love her sheep.  She let them out into the field where we were picking and they rocketed out - leaping and running!  It was wonderful to watch.  They are beautiful Shetlands.  I brought whey for her friendly Tamworth pig, and I always love to watch the amazing array of poultry free ranging around their farm.  It's a little piece of heaven.  Marianne joined us and we had a nice get-together.  I left with the back of the Ford filled with apples and the nice, warm feeling I always have after spending time with the Ms.  I stopped on my way home to make two visits, as I am trying not to do nothing but work all weekend.  They were short but sweet (the visits, that is), and one visit resulted in my gleaning three large, sweet red peppers!  By the time I got home, it started to rain off and on.  I let the sheep out into the back fenced area and got a wire enclosure around one of my two apple trees.  I would love to let them graze without supervision, but Hoosier is way too fond of my little apple trees.  I have one more to protect, then my one surviving cherry.  Then they can have a ball.Faced with a very small amount of flour remaining in my stash, I had a challenge coming up with something to bake for the barn crew on Sunday morning.  I ended up with Fudge Drops, from the KAF Bakers Companion - one of my favorites.  It only used 3/4C of flour.  Which I had.  Just.  It also calls for 2C of semi-sweet chocolate bits.  The mixture is very much like brownie batter - just a little thicker.  The cookies bake into crackly molten chocolate disks.  They smelled wonderful!  The dogs and I dropped them off at the milking parlor on our morning walk.  They got a five thumbs up!  Now that I am flourless, I am backed to the wall - the next thing I bake MUST be gluten free!I put on a crock pot full of butternut squash chili, based on the delicious recipe I found over at Thy Hand Hath Provided, for Saturday's dinner and my week of lunches.  I didn't have black beans so I used red beans, but used everything else (I also halved the recipe, since I am the  only one I'm serving!)  Since I was on a winter squash trend, I whipped up a batch of Pumpkin Hummus that was to die for!  I brought it along to dinner Sunday at Sylvie's and it was good!  I will be making this many times this winter.  I got the recipe here.  I didn't swirl the honey on top, nor did I garnish it with chickpeas.  It is incredibly light.  I'm going to try the pumpkin cornbread next, with a non-wheat baking mix I've concocted.  Sylvie made a wonderful stew with butternut squash, apples and apple sausage.  I am still waiting for the recipe (ahem - tap, tap, tap, tap).  Such a healthy, sumptuous weekend!  I got two of my UFOs done - both the cotton tab towels.  I gave one to my mother and the other....well, the holidays are coming.  My Meyer lemon tree is loaded with lemons and they are finally starting to ripen!  I got out her winter grow light and hung it overhead.  Nothing is too good for my lemon tree.  I also managed to get all of my laundry done and hung out.  Of course, it's still drying, thanks to the rain.  But it's supposed to be clear today and most of tomorrow, so I'm hoping everything will eventually dry on the line.  The weekend was a perfect balance of work and friends.Just think.  I have been yakking away to all of you nice, patient people 300 times over the past year and a half or so!  Something must be done to reward you for your humorous and supportive comments, your zany wit, the generosity of your advice and counsel.  How about a giveaway!?I bet you didn't know that I have a collection of VINTAGE (that's for you, Jane) aprons!  I will 'gift' these three wonderful aprons (all cleaned, ironed and starched - all gently used but in great condition - they are vintage, retro antiques, after all) to one lucky winner!  BUT WAIT!  That's not all -- our lucky winner will also receive a copy of The Apron Book!  It's a great read, full of photographs, remembrances and patterns.  Woot!  The winner will be chosen by random drawing (eyes closed, hand rummaging in hat among tiny bits of paper with your names on them - all very scientific) on Sunday, with the winner announced Monday.  Deadline for entry is midnight Friday.To enter, just leave a comment below.  You may leave an anecdote about an apron-y memory, but it's not required.  I'm just inherently nosy!  Plus, I love you to pieces."},
{"title": "Monday Musings.", "date": "Monday, October 17, 2011", "text": "Who ever came up with \"kick yourself\"?  Have you ever tried?  It's nigh on impossible!  I suppose, if you were double-jointed it could be done.  Otherwise, you'd be left with trying to kick your own ankle.  Which is painful.  Yes, research was done on this subject with much personal sacrifice by yerstruly.Watches can be very cruel.  Many, many hours can go by in my mind, yet, when I look at my watch, only one real hour has passed.  It is a proven fact that weekend time moves at lightspeed rates, as opposed to workweek time, which crawwwwwls along.More musing on mirrors.  Besides being startled most times when I look at my image (mind: 30 vs. mirror: reality), during the week I tend to be busy on home-type things right up until moments before I have to jettison myself out the door for my commute to work.  I think it might be helpful to have a glimpse in the mirror BEFORE I walk into the office.  There is a smoking area - of which the borders are very hazy (harharhar) - outside of our office building.  Most mornings, two young 'gofers' who work for a large law firm in the building are generally hanging out, smoking, slouching and texting like mad, when I enter the building.  This morning, we all went into the elevator at the same time.  They were eyeing my red Netflix dvd return envelope and my Dansko clogs.  I looked them in the eye(s) and said, \"Yes, I don't stream, text, tweet, or smoke.  I am SO not cool.\"  Only middle age has given me the moxie to be myself and proud of it."},

{"title": "Gettin' Ready to Rumble!", "date": "Friday, October 7, 2011", "text": "Are you all sitting down?  The forecast for the \"WEEKEND\" (yes, both days) is for bright sunshine and balmy temps!  Lawsy, I hope I didn't just jinx myself by putting it out there...  so, given that I got almost nothing done on The Lists last weekend, this is going to be a multiple-list-eggstravaganza.And speaking of eggs, gak.  Yesterday, a mild, brightly sunny day, garnered zero eggs.  Nada.  Nuthin.  No eggs, no how.  It's got me stumped.  Even my Barnevelder girls, who are youngsters and who are NOT moulting, are not laying.  The only egg I get almost every day is a duck egg.  Well, thank goodness for that.Yesterday, Kevin Ford came out and sheared the lambs.  I tell you, they were tiny before losing their fleece.  Now they look like a miniature breed.  Except for Linden, who is at the right level for his age/breed.  Acacia is getting back to her noisy, feisty self.  She has learned that she needs to trot right up to the gate in the morning, so I can let her out onto the grass.  As soon as she hears the grain can rattling, she trots off to her own little feed dish.  What a cutie.  And what a relief.  The adult ewes still need to be wormed, but I am making headway.My plans to get hay this weekend were squelched by a family wedding (the farmer's, not mine) on Saturday and his need to chop corn on Sunday.  He was nice enough to offer to give me hay if I run out before next weekend.  Which I will.  This lull will give me the opportunity to clean out the barn so I can stack the 100 bales without worrying that the little piranhas goats will be able to reach it.  I am also going to see if I can disassemble the lattice house frame (thank goodness I screw everything together) so I can move it and use it as winter shelter for the sheep, with a few alterations.  It's time to move them into a new area so that the old, over-used one has time to recover.  Once I move them, I am going to seed it before winter.  Or so it says on my \"Outdoor/Animal\" list.  My lists have big ideas.I've moved the electronet so that the sheep can have some grass, but it will entail some fancy footwork and creative electrical work (neither of which is my forte).  Hey, Apple Pie Gal - ZZZZZZt!  Kidding, I hope.  Because of the way I had to set up the charger to keep the top wire hot, I can't move it.  And because of my elaborate (read: wacky) gate system, I have to put the connecting end of the fencing on the other/opposite side of the gate.  That means I will have to rig up a long connecting wire from the fence to the charger over/across the gate opening using wire, baling twine and plastic tubing.  Since I know that Hoosier is capable of doing the limbo, he will just have to work his way under the wire.  This should be interesting.  But, he's a smart cookie and he loves his grass.The Babes (surprise chicks) will be integrated into the main coop this weekend.  That will give me one less step in the mornings/evenings.  Then, the small coop will be closed up for the winter, unless I decide to banish the ducks to the small coop.  I am thinking about it.Much needs to be done in the garden.  Lucy needs to be interred somewhere where the foxes, coyotes and stray dogs won't find her.  There is an over-abundance of llama beans that need shoveling and spreading.  The strawberries need to be given a haircut and mulched.  I am thinking that I need a partner in all this.  Here are the qualifications:  Must be older than me; must be good with his hands in practical ways (electrical/plumbing/carpentry); must love animals in all sizes and shapes; must be retired and not indigent; must like to cook; must not spend all his time on his dusty-buster; must have a sense of humor; must have the patience of Job; must be a good kisser.  So, if anyone out there is either this person or knows someone who fits this bill, send 'em on down!  While I'm waiting, I think I will tackle my lists.p.s.  I am going to celebrate either my 20,000th page view or my 300th posting (how I DO go on!) - whichever comes first - with a very special giveaway.  Stay tuned."},

Mice, it's Mice 2 and Susan 1.  I seriously think they have enhanced night vision and, as soon as I've parked my car in the driveway and gone into the house, plans are pulled out, building material gathered, and a small unit of mice invades my car.  There, they build frantically, until every nook, cranny and filter is occupied.Last Monday, I took the car in for an oil change and mouse-cleaning-out.  I had just had work done under the dashboard from a prior mouse attack less than a week before.  This time, my long-suffering mechanic opened the hood and did a thorough scan of all the places they could get in.  He finally found a plastic barrier that they had chewed through.  So, he reinforced it with wire mesh and told me to put baited mousetraps in the car, just in case there were still mice in residence.  That instilled me with confidence.  I could read the headlines now, \"12 Car Pile-Up Caused by Erratic Driving by Hysterical Woman\".  It would continue, \"local nut-job claims that six mice ran across her feet while she was driving, causing her to channel a medley of 'Smoky and the Bandit' reruns in rapid succession.\"So, the mousetrap will stay until Friday.  Then I hope to have the inside of my dashboard, with all it's mysterious \"filters\", nuts and bolts reassembled so I can get heat without the fear of rodent flambe."},

{"title": "What I am learning about being Gluten-Free.", "date": "Tuesday, October 4, 2011", "text": "I would have to say that the most important thing I've learned is that (gasp) I can live without bread.  There, I've said it.  It's been viewed.  That doesn't mean that I don't really, really miss bread.  What I've also learned is that - so far - it's no problem to go without gluten-free bread.  I have not met one piece, rendition, loaf, slice, crumb or otherwise of GF bread that I can choke down.  Of course, I have just begun this journey so there is still hope that I may find a stand-in.Another plus side to this (besides feeling better) is that I've lost weight.  I was really surprised at how many things I ate that contained gluten.  This means that the usual snack suspects were no longer on the Good To Eat List.  I am not counting Cape Cod Potato Chips here because those have become an obsession.  Those are on my Don't You Dare Eat List.  The one meal where I feel the loss of gluten most of all is breakfast.  Muffins, coffeecake, toast, scones, sigh.So, as the saying goes around the farm, I just pulled on my Big Girl Pants and got creative.  This has had some added benefits - I am using grains and flours I've never tried before; some I've never heard of.  Sorghum flour?  Wha?  Guar gum?  er...  There is a wealth of information on the Internet at my fingertips and lots of others have paved the path towards tolerable - yes, even delicious - gluten-free food.  My biggest excitement in the breakfast arena has been rediscovering a food of my childhood.  Fried Mush.  Oooh.  Doesn't that just sound delish?  I was born and raised my first few years in Newport News, Virginia.  Both my parents had been in the Navy and my dad had finished his degree in mechanical engineering in Ohio.  Looking for work, he ended up finding a job at the shipyards in Newport News.  So, in my formative years, I was exposed to hush puppies, spoon bread, mush, and being referred to as \"A Mess\".  That was a big compliment back then and down there - and, although I can still be referred to as a mess on many occasions, I continue to view it as a positive comment about myself.Back to topic.  My mother was and is a stellar cook.  My dad was exclusively the Grill Man.  But he also had some 'specialities d' Papa'.  One was fudge and the other was fried mush.  Basically, fried mush is plain speak for sauteed polenta.  I prefer fried mush - it's not pretentious.  It's a Mess.   Sorry, I couldn't help myself.  To make a mess of mush, one simply stirs cornmeal into boiling water with a little salt, stirs it until it's thick, lets it cook for a while, then takes it off the heat.  A quick smear of butter in a loaf pan, pour in the mush, let it cool, then put it in the fridge overnight.  In the morning, slice and fry in butter until slightly crispy around the edges.  Serve with maple syrup.  MmmMmm.  It goes wonderfully with a couple of eggs and bacon.  Or just all by its lonesome in a small pool of real maple syrup.  Mush has given me back Breakfast."},

I had inherited a good-sized dog house from my neighbor (a builder) and he had very nicely dropped it at the top of my driveway.  I swear to God, this thing weighed 400 lbs!  It had started raining pretty steadily and Acacia only had trees for shelter.  So, I put on my big girl pants (and big girl rain gear).  I had to move it.  It took over 20 minutes of wet rassling and lots of limited vocabulary words, but I got it inside the fence, put hay and feed in it, and she popped right in, happy as a nice damp clam.  After wrestling with that bad boy, I decided that, should I ever decide to build a house, my neighbor has the job.Then I zipped off to the Farmers Market - where a few hearty souls stood under pooling tents - and got mums for my mum and me; a big bag of mixed mushrooms (thank you Linda - dripping with sarcasm here - for introducing me to these); a Savoy cabbage the size of a bowling ball - so perfect it almost brought tears to my eyes - for $2; and assorted other vegetables.  Then I zipped back to the apple orchard where I picked my own - out of bushels in their dry store and NOT from the orchard; then to the feed store; gasoline; home.  Then I realized my pork roast was just too puny and put in an emergency call to Marianne, who had a lovely roast - at home and not at the market.  I managed to clean the house, clean the cats' room (whispering this so that all cats reading who do not have their own room won't be jealous), washed dishes, and did a major tidying up, before I raced north to meet Marianne at her house to pick up the roast, then zoomed home to beat my parents up the driveway.  After that, I just gave up, as I really can't do much while they're here.  It was a thoroughly enjoyable visit, with a boisterous firehouse breakfast (the food was just as bad as I remember), some Glenn Miller on the CD player, much cooking and moving around of sheep, lambs and goats, then a lovely dinner with my parents and my neighbors.  There is something so nice and heartwarming about a table set with cloth, flowers and good china, surrounded by people who like each other, are nice and fun, full of good chatter.  And the food - it was good.  I had convinced myself that I would not have any of the French apple cake, since it contained flour.  That resolve disappeared as soon as it was flipped over on its serving plate, all hot, caramel-y, apple-y.  I did, virtuous me, have a very small piece.Kay brought over her personal trainer (aka Gideon, the Sheltie puppy) to meet everyone.  Scrappy and Bernie were not pleased, so they stayed inside.  We were all entranced by how smart he is.  At least there were glimpses of blue sky yesterday.  There are two more days of showers and rain, then the forecast is much better.  I sure hope so, because I need to get 100 bales of hay this weekend.  Which reminds me.  I am going to have to butter up the farmer - I need him and his truck to get it.  Maybe a lemon meringue pie?"},

Just what I needed.", "date": "Tuesday, September 27, 2011", "text": "Something NEW to obsess over.  While I was at the wool fest, I was very proud of myself - I put both hands in my pockets and only picked up yarn for my mom's birthday (thank you, Melanie -- she loved it!) and then just looked.  After all, I have the mother of all stashes at home - not to mention two friends who produce amazing yarn that are within a 20 minute drive.  I was further laden with a quickly thawing gallon of home-pressed apple cider with which Melanie gifted me!  That kept at least one hand busy.I was almost home-free, working my way toward the exit when I uttered (to myself) those fateful words -- \"Oh, there's a little building I haven't seen.  I'll just give it a quick walk through before I leave.\"  Ha.  I made a quick circle and then, in the final space on the way out I saw it.  As fate (oh, fickle fate) would have it, I had chanced upon her website on Friday and spent a good half hour talking myself into and out of buying one of the \"Hip to be Square\" looms.  I was so nostalgic for those wonderful potholder looms.  But, to be able to a) make potholders to one's delight; b) to reuse sock bits doing it; c) and make a rag rug from said recycled-sock-potholders?  Could I resist?  I did at the time - the shipping charges always get to me.Pile 'o potholdersSigh.  There was no shipping cost barrier at the wool fest.  I walked out with a loom and a big bag of sock loopies.  Then, when I finally got home, I spent a half hour of time much better spent on my \"list\", making a potholder.  Well, two.  Then I made another in the morning.  And I started another during a break from putting up my goat fence.  Then I finished that one and started another before bed.  Aiiiiirgh.  I did manage to keep myself from sneaking it into the office.  Sure, I could have made my own loom (I used to have one that I made many, many years ago) with nails on a frame.  But this loom has very nice, smooth eye screws that don't snag every last piece of material until you want to say lots of bad words loudly.  It is, quite frankly, mindless fun.  I find that I like mindless fun.  Especially when it means that I will end up with a cool rag potholder rug.  And it has made me think of other things I can create - with my Flora's lopi that I will be getting back from the mill; with the big pile of t-shirt strip balls that I have in the closet; with the spools of silk threads I've been hauling around for a coon's age.  The possibilities are endless!I am finally winding down the canning process.  Last night I made six half-pints of tomatillo salsa.  There are only apples to go - and maybe a pumpkin or two.  And that's it.  Really.  Honest injun.  I swear.Tomatillo salsa"},

{"title": "Moving right along...", "date": "Thursday, September 22, 2011", "text": "We have had a string of rainy days, which makes getting things done in the few hours of daylight now left for me a real challenge.  I find myself taking an item on my list and breaking it into smaller steps that I can squeeze in after work or before I leave in the morning.  Yesterday was a glorious day - very foggy in the morning but the sun broke through, the air was ionized and the sky was azure.  I had to leave very early for work, as I left at noon to drive to meet my parents at the eye doctor for my dad's MD treatment.I apologize, but I am going to go off on a slight rant now.Since it would be cutting it too close for me to pick them up at the house and get them to the doctor on time, I suggested my parents call a taxi for the ride there, and that I would meet them and then take them home.  It is H.E.L.L. getting old.  The taxi driver (woman) pulls up in a van.  A van that is HIGH off the ground.  She does not get out to assist them into the back, leaving them to struggle with the door.  Then, my mother who has a very difficult time stepping up and, thanks to botched rotator cuff surgery, cannot pull herself up into the van, struggles for some time to get in.  The seat is pulled forward, so there is little space.  Meanwhile, through this grueling and embarrassing procedure, the driver SITS IN HER SEAT TALKING ON HER CELL PHONE.  By the time they were in and delivered to the doctor's office, my mother was completely flustered and near tears.  I tell you, had I been there, I would have hauled that driver out by her collar.  I am still steamed.  And it's pretty darn evident that they are not spring chickens and would have needed some assistance.  What has happened to common courtesy?  To just having good manners and being helpful?  Shineola.Sorry.Long story short, we fast danced through the procedure, I got them home and made sure everyone was recovered, then drove home to take advantage of the rest of the daylight.  I used the push mower to trim down the new fence path, then mowed everything I could until it ran out of gas.  Other than some clean-up of the blades, etc., it is now ready for winter.  Then I set up the new fence line with the electronet and watched the sheep and llama bounce out into their new grass.  I ignored the goaties (which is difficult - they can be LOUD) and did a little clean up around the place.  By then, the light started to fade, so I did my regular chores, had an amazing mushroom pasta dish (quinoa pasta), had a glass of wine and fell into bed.  No coyotes last night, so I was able to catch up a bit on lost sleep.  In the early morning hours, the rain woke me up, so it looks as if we are back to another string of rainy days.  I sat down this morning and made up my list for Saturday, which caused me to burst into hysterical laughter.  Let's just label it as \"fiction\".For those who are interested in Maremmas, this blog is a great place to watch them in action.  She is a great writer and I love the photographs."},
{"title": "Bagpipes and Coyotes.", "date": "Tuesday, September 20, 2011", "text": "What do they have in common, you ask?  Both stir strong emotions - especially in shepherds.  Last night a large pack of coyotes got extremely close to the sheep pen.  Alarmingly close.  I was furiously finishing a knitting project and enjoying the peace and quiet, when they started.  The dogs jumped up, the cats ran, and I beat a quick path to the back deck.  I turned on the flood lights and Scrappy and I ran outside.  Bernie had decided she was better off in her crate.  One second of all that noise and he took a sharp left (in the direction opposite to the sheep) and tore into the chicken yard, barking furiously.  I don't blame him.  He was greatly outnumbered.  I saw Hoosier cushed on the ground between the sheep and the fence.  Cushed (lying down in llama-speak).  Either he has nerves of steel or he's as smart as a turnip.  I clanged some metal objects together and the pack finally took off.And so started my night.  Kay and I called each other to keep abreast of their location.  I could hear her Maremmas barking their heads off.  Hmmm.  Maybe I should turn Hoosier in for a Maremma.  In any event, the coyotes kept this up for quite a while.  I made sure the new hot wire was turned on and then loaded the .22.I finally hit the sack around 10 and was thinking about the similarities between bagpipers in 1500 Scotland, coming down a hill, pipes wailing, piercing through the sounds of war and causing blood to run cold in the veins of their enemies, while whipping their own forces into a bloodthirsty fury.  As for me, at the first sound of a piper, the tears well up in my eyes and I am crying within seconds.  It stirs something very deep and sad in me.  Not so, the coyote songs.  The cacophony of the coyote pack, with its shrill yips, howls, barks, and other ungodly sounds, sure can make your blood run cold.It was a long night.  This morning, it was raining.  I was so relieved, because I knew that all the sheep and their erstwhile guardian would be in the hoop house.  The dogs and I took a short walk down my road and it soon became clear just how close the coyote pack had gotten.  The dogs were whipping around, noses to the ground, all around the barn and down along the road.  Thank goodness those tasty morsels (aka the goaties) were safely locked up for the night.  I hope the pack moves on.  I know the importance of predators and keeping the balance.  But it seems that we are heavy on coyotes and light on natural prey - rabbits, etc.  I will keep my rifle loaded."},

Hell! card game hootenanny, when she told my mom they were out furniture shopping for a new sofa.  They were going to have someone come and pick up the old one.  My mom (who has an intense dislike of my present Freecycle couch) said, \"OH!  Susan would LOVE it!\"  Does she know her daughter?  A FREE sofa?  Faded but clean, large enough for me, Scrappy and all the cats?  And a sofa bed to boot?  Halleluiah!  I hot-footed it down to the dairy farm this morning to sweet-talk the farmer into picking it up and delivering it for me.  The \"good\" news, I told him, was that is was going from in a garage, up three small steps, right into my waiting living room - less than a city block.  The \"bad\" news was that it weighed a ton.  This is a man who rassles Holsteins.  A sleeper sofa is peanuts.  Now I have to find someone to schlep the oldie but moldie to the transfer station.  While it rankles to dispose of large pieces of furniture which will head toward a landfill, I feel a tad better because it was well- (well, ill-) used before it came to me, then I gave it another five years of abuse use.  But, honestly, I have hated it from day one.  Once you sink into that puppy, it's like a bad bean bag - you have to struggle to get out of it.  So I am doing the happy dance about my new-to-me sofa!  I am not letting Scrappy and the Boyz in on the fact that it's a sleeper sofa.  They will expect the Egyptian cotton sheets, fold-down service and mints on the pillow every night.  Boyz!"},

BAD IDEA.  Sage managed to jettison herself through the electronet fence in with the sheep (who were not happy for the competition) and Chicky got himself tangled up in the darn stuff, so I was out with my gloves getting zapped, Chicky untangled, trying to get Sage out and the sheep away from the downed fence.  Gak!  In the hubbub, Banyan, the moorit mouflon wether, must have been startled and hurt his leg - he couldn't put weight on it.  I got the goats back into the barn through the lure of grain in their bowls and re-hooked the fence.  Then Kay and I checked Banyan for breaks or other dire injury.  Today, after a night of resting it, he is still a little sore, but seemed much better. I had set up a dinner last night so I would be forced to quit and come in at a reasonable hour.  But my dinner date couldn't make it, so I went outside at 10:30a and did not stop until 5:30p.  I was sure I would collapse into bed and sleep the sleep of the dead.  Ohhhh, nooooo.  A mouse is chewing something in a wall in the bedroom and the coyotes started up - which made me think of Banyan being vulnerable, which made me think of the llama, which made me think of how he is destroying my fence and I have to put an electric line on the perimeter THIS WEEKEND, etc.  But, it was a very satisfying weekend, with a lot checked off the lists.  I have a sub-list for this week so that I'm not faced with the same daunting tasks this next weekend.  It's my mother's birthday on Sunday and we are all celebrating on Saturday, so my window of opportunity is cut in half.  I figure, if I peel and cook tomatoes every night this week, and can what I cook every morning, I should be done by Friday.  I may require a monitor next summer to keep me out of the tomato fields.  Volunteers?Very quick on to announce the giveaway(s) winners:Drumroll please....Tasha Tudor book:Leigh!Bread book:Ruth!Email your snail mail address to me at swomersley at gmail dot com and your books will be sent out this week.  Thank you to everyone who entered with their wonderful poetry!  Talent abounds!!"},

this is going to be a LOOOONG post.  Feel free to hit the pause button and get an adult beverage.  Or just go back to the previous post and leave me another sonnet!Yesterday was spent on the first of many - I am sure - trips to accompany one/both parents to a specialist.  My dad just turned 89 a couple of weeks ago and my mom will be turning 88 in a week.  They are, for the most part, in pretty good health and mental standing.  But things are beginning to go wrong.  Heck, at 89, it's a surprise he's held out as long as he has.  My mother suffers from macular degeneration, the \"wet\" kind, and it's in her only sighted eye.  She is determined to retain her eyesight as long as humanly and medically possible.  I will not fill you in on the gory details, but the medical procedure that she endures every 10 weeks gives me the willies.  Yet, she never complains.  My dad has just been diagnosed with a tiny bit of MD in one eye.  That was the upshot of yesterday's trip to the retina specialist.I think, up until yesterday, that I have housed the hope that they will continue on their merry way without my intervention, for years.  This is not the case.  I am very happy to be able to help them.  I figure they have been there for me every day of my life and it's nice to be able to be there for them.  But it's a journey fraught with emotional baggage and not one for the faint of heart or short of patience.  For instance:  I need to leave my house and do two errands on my way to their house.  I give myself an hour for the usual 40 minute journey.  Thanks to more flooding and heavy rain, it takes the entire hour, plus three minutes.  I pull in their driveway and -- their car is outside, they are standing in the garage, rain gear on, umbrellas in hand, envelope with directions clenched in Dad's fist.  I am given enough time to race inside to use the facilities, while they get into the car and wait for me.  Then there are the negotiations over the best route to take to the medical office - an hour and a half away.  Dad still relies on maps and distrusts anything computer generated.  I work in the area, so am familiar with it.  We go from his carefully mapped-out route - which, on a good day, would take three hours - to my way, which takes a half hour.  BUT first we have to stop and have lunch.  Let me fast forward here -- I'm beginning to hyperventilate.I drop them at the door and park the car a quarter mile away.  By the time I get upstairs, reception has handed my father a twelve page form he has to fill out.  Patients are stacked like cordwood and moved around from one waiting area to another -- this is done to give the illusion that you're making progress.  Another go-around over the forms.  I realize that my dad is struggling.  He's hard of hearing.  He's unable to grasp a lot of information.  He thinks doctors are gods.  And, he's having to rely more and more on his daughter(s).  It's tough.  Plus, I am dealing with my mother's increasing impatience with him -- due, most likely, to the fact that it's terrifying to realize that the man you've counted on for everything over the past 60+ years is not up to snuff.  That, and she's never been an icon of patience.  We go back and forth and settle for me filling in the information while he sorts through all his cards for the necessary numbers.  Then we are shuffled from waiting area to waiting area.  It took two hours.  I did manage to insert myself in with the doctor so I could find out what was going on, what the diagnosis was, what the treatment would be and what the timing of everything was expected to be.  They think they have caught it early enough that one shot might stop further damage.  I also was able to head off more visits to this office, since their specialists work in my parents' town once a week.  Of course, had they bothered to look at the address in the file...As I was sitting in the various areas, I realized that most of the patients were elderly.  And most seemed to be accompanied by a son/daughter/relative.  What did not seem to happen often was that the relative was actively involved in the diagnosis.  Now, far be it from me to impose my standards - I am a Type A when in comes to this stuff - but what is needed, I feel, is an advocate for elderly patients and their families in every doctor's office everywhere.  It is a win/win situation.  Patients have someone to help them with forms, disseminate information, help set up treatment appointments, etc.  A hard copy summarizing the diagnosis and treatment would be invaluable.  Jobs are created.  And lord knows these \"specialists\" can afford to hire a couple more people.I ferried them home (almost literally, as it was still raining), dropped them off, then headed back to my place.  I am very thankful that they are high and dry, safe and sound.  All the streams are over their banks.  Roads are being re-washed out.  We lost the use of another small bridge in town.  The endless grey and drumming rain is enough to cause me to think of red wine as a three-meal-a-day accompaniment.  The only happy feet around my place are webbed.I hope for a) cessation of all wet things falling from the sky and b) DSL service so I can show you all my nifty photographs.  Until then, \"Cheers\" (clink)."},

On my list is to charge my cell phone; pick up cat food, poultry feed and dog food; and check the propane for my grill.  And, best of all, I have my doggies to keep me warm!  In a way, I do hope the storm hits earlier.  I would rather have the ability to assess damage Sunday, rather than wake to it on Monday.  That is NO way to start the week!\r\rSigning off for now.  I'll post tomorrow if I get the chance.   If you are in Irene's path, I hope you are all safe and secure -- and well-prepared."},

{"title": "Farmy-type Stuff.", "date": "Thursday, July 14, 2011", "text": "I realize I have to be more diligent about rotating the sheep within the tight confines of my small farm.  On the Fourth, when the sheep were finally sheared, Flora very conveniently deposited a nice pile of sheep beans on the shearer's foot.  Those were sent off to the vet for analysis, as I thought she showed signs of being wormy.  Right-o.  The results came back and she's loaded, so I'll drench her tonight (with Kay's help) and tackle the rest on an as-caught basis.  Poor old dear.  I wonder if there is a female shepherd out there that does all this stuff solo.  If so, she must be strong as an ox and a LOT younger than I.I am going to have to come up with more marketing ideas, it seems, as it's necessary to reduce the sheep population by almost half before winter.  Acacia (one of Flora's ewe lamb twins) is going to Heartsease Farm in Dansville the weekend after next, so that leaves three more to go:  Hazel (Flora's other ewe twin), Banyan and Hickory (Cocoa's ram/ewe twins).  Actually, either Banyan or Juniper can go - both are moorit mouflon soon-to-be-wethers (Banyan's on his way there, Juni's time is nigh).  Juni is growing an impressive set of horns, though, and that is usually a deal-breaker, even though he is the sweetest little guy.  They are all beautiful lambs and will make a wonderful addition to someones fiber flock.  I am keeping Linden because a) he is sweet and b) he is a white soon-to-be wether.  I think most people are looking for color in their flock.The Red Rangers have their date with destiny next Tuesday.  They are going late, as I would have rather had them smaller -- I swear they are small turkey-sized.*  I have nothing but good things to say about them, though.  They grew well, are calm, lovely birds and forage well.  That will be one less chore, so it's all good.Next Monday, Linden gets banded and we check to see if Juni has grown enough.  That will be a relief to have done, as I do not want any surprises this spring.  Lambs are not in the plans for this farm for a while.  I have been slowly working on skirting all of Flora's fleeces and have a good amount of fleece ready for the fiber mill.  We are going to be up in the area on Tuesday, so I will bring it along and drop it off for processing.  Apparently, they are not fast on the return, which is fine with me, as I would rather deal with wool in the fall.  And it will give me an idea of how well they turn it out.  I have a large assortment of fleece (fleeces?) but I want to keep a couple to wash, card and spin myself.  I am determined to learn to spin this winter.  Now that the Boyz are only mildly insane, I might be able to work on it without dealing with flying cats tangling up my yarn.Grendal, my female Muscovy, and Alfie the Pekin drake are in the market for a new home.  They are too disruptive and need to go elsewhere.  I will have to think about Puff's happiness, which will probably have to include a small drake of some type.  She, apparently, cannot live without a man.  My sister is graciously house sitting for me while I take Acacia to Dansville.  She and her husband will take their four little pullets home with them when they leave.  So it looks like I am on track for meeting my downsizing goals.Lambs anyone?*It seems the freezer, after a thorough defrosting and two-day rest, is coming back to life!  Woot!!"},

Thank goodness he had just moved to the other side of his patio.  We agreed that she should always have someone on hand to help her with ANYTHING involving open windows from now on.Those of us left in the wake of her visits are sometimes left picking up the pieces.  She was in town for a typical short, fast-and-furious visit with her son and stayed with me last night.  They are both anxious to help and pitch in with a lot of enthusiasm; being knowledgeable about the task at hand is low on their list of priorities.I took them to the train station this morning, after she gave me a hand with morning chores.  I came home tonight to find all 28 of my chickens spread over the yard, the road, and over hell's half acre.  She hadn't latched the gate to the chicken yard fence.  Did I mention I got a total of about 3 hours of sleep last night?  And it was sprinkling?  And the sheep were baaing, goats were bleating, dogs were barking?  I have all but one back in the yard and I'm hoping to be able to lure the ninny toward the gate in a few minutes while there's still light.I believe this will be a two-glass-of-wine evening."},
{"title": "And now, the details.", "date": "Thursday, July 7, 2011", "text": "As my friend, Sylvia, said, that back business was god's way of saying, \"SLOW DOWN!\"  Amen.  But, as you ALL know well, that phrase is not used often on the homestead.  It's more of a \"giddyap\".  Here's the loooong weekend, as it happened on the homestead.Friday, the lovely woman (and her brave husband) who sold me the Nigerians, met me in the afternoon to band the ram lambs.  Kay volunteered to cut her spinning group date short to help, too.  We rounded up the youngsters and, to give it a literary bent, it was the Three Bears all over again.  Linden was too big for the equipment and a larger elastrator must be found.  Juniper was too small, and gets a few weeks reprieve.  Banyan was just right, and walked funny for a couple of hours.Saturday was F.U.N.  I was up early and had chores finished by 7:15a, so I could drive over to a little dairy goat farm to try my hand at milking.  I didn't do too badly for my first try.  My very generous and patient teacher was Mary Lou, who raises Nigerians, milks them and makes cheese.  For fun.  She lives on a beautiful place with a big pond, nine goats, 20 ducks and 2 geese.  I had a wonderful visit and am invited back whenever I want.  Then came my weekly sojourn to Vermont, where I ran a few errands (goat treats, mineral block, groceries), did some planting for my mother, had lunch with my parents, trotted back to the homestead, started on the chicken coop (two loads down, 30 to go), raked llama beans and spread them around, fought Japanese beetles, reinforced the gate on the hoop house, did four loads of laundry, and let the tweenage pullets out with the big girls for the first time - under supervision.Sunday was back to monsoon season.  The dogs and I got caught halfway between home and farm and were soaked to the skin by the time we hoofed it back home.  For added enjoyment, there was thunder, which meant that Bernie was a sodden hysteric on the end of the leash.  After toweling us all off and letting Bernie under the bed for the duration, I retired to the kitchen to bake two pies for the library function (pecan and peach custard), brownies for the barn crew, and a peach/blueberry/raspberry cobbler for a cookout on the Fourth.  I also made a large batch of Scandinavian-style egg salad (horseradish/capers).  Then I cleaned the house and delivered the pies.Monday morning was a frenzy of getting everything together for the shearer.  I take full advantage of having the sheep on their bums and planned on Cocoa's CDT vaccination, hooves trimmed, wormer where needed, and I wanted to check Flora's temperature.  She was sounding like a steam engine - she's 10 and tends to have respiratory problems.  When it gets hot and humid, she starts wheezing.  Melanie arrived early to help and we had a very nice sit-down visit until Kevin arrived at 11.  I had just tricked them into the hoop house and slammed the gate shut behind them.  This left poor Melanie to scramble in and out of my convoluted gate system to get the tarp, plastic bags and medical kit.  (Thank you, Melanie!!)Flora as a bean bagI love to watch Kevin work - so careful, gentle and methodical.  He knows sheep and can let you know if there is something lacking in their nutrition (poor fleece growth), whether they look wormy or not (they all did), and anything else you may or may not have noticed.  The sheep are so relaxed while he shears that they just sag around like lanolin bean bags.  I noticed that Cocoa was much calmer this year and wonder if it's due to a second round of lambs.  Flora was kind enough to deposit a nice pile of sheep beans, which I scooped up and put in a baggie for the vet.  Then Kevin looked at Hoosier and said, in his lovely Gaelic lilt, \"so, are you planning to shear that llama?\"  Well, yes, but I hadn't thought to ask if he sheared llamas.  There aren't many around who will.  It turned out that, yes, he did indeed shear llamas.  So off I went to grab Hoosier's halter and lead, and we got him tethered to a tree in the shade.  What a transformation.  And what fiber!!  Little did Hoosier know but, until that fiber hit the ground, he was two steps from the exit door.Hoosier, as an Alien Giraffe After I hauled up the little fleece that I can use -- most was mulching material -- I figured I had an hour and a half before I had to get ready for the cookout.  So.....I decided it was enough time to squeeze in more shoveling out of the chicken coop.  Wrong-o.  Never, I repeat, never rush a really physical job.  As I twisted around with my heavy shovel-full of gak, a nice hot pain went up my spine and I was down for the count.  I hobbled into the house, took a bunch of ibuprofen, grabbed the phone and took a prone position on the floor.  Where I instantly became (and remained) an object of feline fascination. I called in my regrets to the cookout hosts, left a message for the dairy farmer to stop by and pick up the cobbler, and watched Murder She Wrote DVDs until I could hobble out to do rudimentary chores, close everyone up, and take more ibuprofen.I am back to about 90 percent.  Live and learn.  Of course, one would think that, having lived through this more than once, I would learn more quickly.  ChickieSage, looking sage-yEnough of that!  Now for the goatie announcement!  After trying out at least a dozen names on them, meet \"Chicory\" (Chickie for short) and \"Sage\" (not short-able).  Kay came up with Chicory (although, I am surprised it wasn't Garam Masala, hehehe), and Sage is one of my favorite names (and herbs).  She seems rather serious for such a pixie-like creature.  Chickie, the little dear, responded to every single name I called him.   He is not particular, as long as he gets a treat and attention.  Sage actually took four goat treats out of my hand this morning!  Progress!!!  Thank you to all of the creative minds that offered up wonderful name ideas.  I was tempted to give them multi-hyphenated names (Chicory-Homer-Snow-Vern-Billy-Janus-Honey-Sam) or (Sage-Fern-Suni-JudyJetson-Houdini-Aster-Thunder-Hester).  But, then, I have trouble remembering my own name most days."},

{"title": "What's Done and What's Doin.", "date": "Tuesday, May 31, 2011", "text": "Sometimes I fantasize about a real vacation - you know, the kind where you put clean clothes in a suitcase, check to make sure you have your airline tickets, then go off without a backwards glance, to someplace where you get clean sheets every day, someone turns down your bed, you can pick up a phone and food is delivered - you get to read all those gazillion books in your 'to-read' stack.  You can get a massage.  Cripers.  Okay, I wouldn't request clean sheets every day, nor new towels (think of all that water, fuel, soap wasted).  I would worry about where that food came from, was it local?  Humanely grown?  Organic?  The book part sounds lovely, though.  Hahahaha, how I've changed.  And for the better.So, instead of the aforementioned vacation, my actual vacation consisted of checking off as much as possible from the \"to-do\" list -- in August-like temps.  Seriously, we went from March to August in less than a week.  But, the sheep have been moved to grass a couple of times, the lattice house has been cleaned out, the rabbits moved in, as well as their chicken TV - aka, the meat chicks.  I've cleaned out the shed, with the exception of two rabbit cages which need tending to, and, most importantly, I've planted the garden.  I've still got one bed to go but that is the squash bed and it will be planted this coming weekend, hopefully.One of the real pluses of being home for (gasp) six days in a row, is that I have been able to spend some quality time with the furred, wooled and feathered folks on the farm.  Lots of dog walks, cat scratching, chicken watching, and lamb squeezes.The youngster hens are now in the little coop with a screen door for viewing purposes.  They are at that wonderful tweenage stage where every new thing brings them to a stunned standstill.  They are glued to the screen door, watching with obvious fascination the goings-on of the big chickens.  The rooster crows and you can almost see the frisson of a thrill running through the little mob.  If only they knew...Speaking of the rooster, I will have to try and work out this camera dilemma.  He is one of the most beautiful, stunning roosters I have ever seen.  I had heard lots of good things about the breed - Barnevelder - and they really are wonderful chickens.  Large, lustrous, gentle.  They lay big, dark brown eggs and are calm compared to the rest of the crew.  I can see why bringing them back as a breed is such a worthwhile cause.  By the time the afternoon heat hits us, the only hens out and about are the Blue Andalusians.  The heat doesn't bother them at all.  They remind me of Jack Russell terriers - they are always busy.The lambs are HUGE.  Except for Juniper, thank goodness, as I still can go out and grab him for my lamb fix.  He is very sweet (like his mother) and lets me snuggle.  He likes to sniff my face and seems to like being toted around.  I do love that lanolin smell.Which reminds me of something else I have (almost) checked off my list - skirting Flora's fleeces.  I am down to the last two.  I don't recommend skirting a thick, VM-filled, heavily lanolined fleece during 90+ degree, humid weather.  But I couldn't bear to go outside, and I didn't want to do any of the inside chores - so I happily worked on the fleece.  It was hot enough that the cats were pooled on the floor and leaving me alone, which is quite a coup.  During my six days, I had also found a source for sheep minerals.  This has been a bugaboo, as I have been trying to find a loose mineral mix that doesn't have molasses (as in the blocks) and has no copper.  My vet's husband is a distributor for a manufacturer that I have researched (Vigortone), so I drove up about an hour north to pick up the minerals and mixing salt.  It helps to have someone with which to split the order (50 lb bags of each) - thank you, Mel - and it sure makes mixing easier when you can do it in tenths.  All the laundry was done and dried on the line, rhubarb was cooked multiple times.  The barn guys got extra baked goods, my grass got mowed, my future yard sale is getting organized, and, all-in-all, it was a productive time 'off''.  The only regret I have is not getting the chicken coop cleaned out.  It was just too darn hot and humid to tackle that.  But it looms in front of me, so maybe this next weekend will be more temperate.  And I could sure use that massage....Coming up?  Time to sort out the lambs."},

I do go all rigid and stare straight ahead.  Heaven help me if there is a traffic jam and I am stuck on it.2.  I have been burlarized three times in my life, and held up at knife point once.  It makes you feel very violated.3.  I have a sticker on my dashboard reading \"BREATHE\".4.  In my teens, I tutored under a sculptor who had done a bust of Leon Trotsky from life, before he (Trotsky) was assasinated.  He kept it on his porch.  And it was amazing.  5.   I agonize over any lapse in my recycling efforts.6.  I prefer almost any food to be cold or room temperature rather hot.  I have been known to order a pizza, bring it home and stick it in the refrigerator so I can eat it cold the next day.7.  I still think of Cleveland as my home, although I was born in Virginia and have moved all over the place.Now, for the most difficult part of this whole exercise - having to choose one versatile blogger out of all the many wonderful, versatile bloggers!  For purely selfish reasons (I want to know seven more things about her) I am passing this onto Carolyn Renee over at Krazo Acres.  I love the humor and wisdom that permeates every post.  She's a wealth of information and an excellent writer!It's not often that I have a) my camera with me; b) sun; c) all while I'm with the sheep!  I managed to get a few photographs of the lambs with the ewes during yesterday's breakfast.  It's amazing how fast they grow.  The older lambs, Linden, Hazel and Acacia, are all eating hay.  As a matter of fact, when I first put the hay out, Linden (Freyda's beautiful ram lamb), backs up and races towards it, flinging himself in a bellyflop in the middle of the hay holder!  This is not, unsurprisingly, very popular with the ewes, who bunt him out.  Enjoy my view!Banyan, Cocoa's moorit mouflon ram lamb.Hickory, Cocoa's moorit ewe lamb, enjoying the sun.Two sets of twins - Flora's Hazel and Acacia, Cocoa's Hickory and Banyan.Sunbathing."},

{"title": "Tough Decisions:  A Long-Winded Post.", "date": "Tuesday, April 26, 2011", "text": "There are times when I think, had I known the decisions I'd have to make doing this homesteady business, I would have stuck with cats and an apartment.  Hahahahaha - kidding.  They do say that ignorance is bliss, and I believe that is true in my case.  Of course, the more one learns, the less ignorance there is to shield you from the hard decisions.  And the bliss fades a bit.This year I have to make some decisions that are difficult for me.  I have about four acres, but a lot of it is not suited for farming, grazing or anything useful.  I have a full time job.  I am a single homesteader.  Sustainability or not, it is an expensive undertaking.  I am having to focus on making this place and the animals on it pay for itself/themselves - at least in part.  Right now, I have, in the sheep department:  4 ewes; 5 lambs (with one or two more to come); 1 ram; 1 llama.  I have been waffling back and forth, to and fro about the purpose of my sheep.  Would I raise them for meat?  Would I raise them for milk?  Would I raise them for their fiber?  All three?  Excuse me while I think out loud:  being a long-time follower of Lewis Carroll, I find it difficult to eat anything I've been formally introduced to.  I am too attached to my lambs.  Milking four ewes?  Just when would I squeeze that twice-a-day activity into my schedule?  That leaves me with fiber.  I am good with that.  I happen to have ewes with great fiber, so I am all set there.  Of course, there's the shearing, skirting, processing, dyeing; but let's leave that for a later discussion.  So, we're firm on one llama and four ewes.  The lambs.  There's a dilemma.  I cannot make a firm decision on them until after the ram lamb trade negotiations are over.  I had decided to keep one of Cocoa's lambs this time, so Banyan will stay.  This is Flora's last lambing, so Hazel will stay.  Then, there is Hickory, Acacia and Linden.  And Juno, who is my secret favorite, hasn't even had her lamb(s).  You can see the problem.  All this rambling to get to this:  I do not need a ram.  I do not need to neuter him because I do not need a PET sheep.  If he had an outstanding fleece, I might consider it - but he doesn't.  And he tends to be prone to respiratory problems.  One sheep with respiratory problems (hello, Flora??) is more than enough.  So I have made the decision to send him to freezer camp.  I have been wrestling with this for weeks, but all indicators point to it being the right decision.  He is getting more aggressive with me and has been shoving the lambs around.  Temperament is a key factor on this homestead.  Not mine, of course.  I'm cranky, but I'm in charge.Another decision is to cull out a lot of my existing flock of chickens.  I am rather attached to many of them, so this is also a tough decision.  Right now, I probably have 28 birds, including two roosters.  Of those 26 hens, 17-tops- are laying.  I refuse to cull Lucy, even though she probably hasn't laid an egg for three years.  She came with me to this homestead, and she's staying 'til the end.  Then, there is Marie-Claire, super-auntie.  She stays, too.  Junior, rooster #1, will have to go to make room for Kees, rooster #2, my Barnevelder rooster.  Home Girl is going to go be cause she's a mean-tempered thing.  Of my two remaining Ameracauna mixes, one is an egg-eater.  She will have to go for practical reasons.  I will miss her green egg, though.  I am working through the flock to bring it down to 20, total.  I have five Barnevelder hens that stay and four more chicks that I am raising.  I have my work cut out for me, if you pardon the expression.I am also going to sell my two rescued red angora rabbits.  I had no intention of keeping them and, once I've spruced them up a bit, they are on the market.  All this angst is the result of not having a plan.  With a plan, you have a clear vision of what will work best and make the most sense.  In order to make a small farm pay for itself -- or, at least, pick up some of the slack -- it has to be pretty flexible.  But flexible in an orderly way.  Clear as mud?  I'd be very interested in hearing other views - pro and con.  Like a lot of new adventurers, I  have so much to learn.Risking a major jinx, I believe the Dreaded Winter is behind us.  I am not kidding myself that I have spring to look forward to -- we will just get deluge after deluge, then it will be hot and humid.  Apparently, that is now spring.  But things are starting to pop up.  GREEN things (gasp).  And this is the time I pull out my old faithful, new-to-me copy of Stalking the Wild Asparagus.  My original copy - purchased when I was a freshman in college (no, not the original edition, thank you, but darn close) - had been held together with tape, then packing tape, then duct tape.  It finally bit the dust when a cat knocked it off the bookshelf and the pages went their own individual ways.  I love this book.  For me, it makes every spring and summer a great adventure - trying to identify wild food.  Thanks to Carolyn Renee at Krazo Acres, a blogger that I follow, I am now on the lookout for Henbit.  I also have my secret morel patch that I am hoping is still there next month.  And there are so many other wonderful groceries on Mother Nature's shelves that I haven't yet tried.What is your favorite go-to book on foraging for wild foods?  What treasures have you come across?"},

{"title": "Talking about bees from up on my soapbox.", "date": "Monday, April 18, 2011", "text": "On Saturday morning, my neighbor, Linda, and I went to meet with an old-time beekeeper south of us.  It was easy to spot his place - a rambling and rather ramshackle property, dotted with bee hives.  This property is on a country road that once was peopled by farmers.  It is now part-time peopled by folks from the Apple, with large, immaculate lawns, perfect paint, and perfect landscaping.  This has pretty much infuriated the beekeeper.  He has been in beekeeping since the early 60s.  During a long and informative visit (he talked to us for an hour and a half), we learned more than in our 5 weeks of beekeeping class.  Back in the earlier days of beekeeping, it was NOT common for beekeepers to lose entire hives.  Then, thanks to the introduction of the Varroa destructor mite, transmitted unknowingly by a major pollinator from Florida, the bees of the northeast were decimated.  The Beekeeper lost 98 of his original 100 hives.  Slowly, over the course of the years, beekeepers have been working on breeding bees that are more resistant to the Varroa mite.  But there are even more obstacles that our little bees must overcome in order to thrive.  Meadows are disappearing.  Lawns are chemically treated, mowed and weeded to within an inch of their lives (as in his neighbors).  Large chemical corporations, like Monsanto, develop and sell GMOs and fertilizers and other unnatural treatments that affect our bees.  Even a bee that is resilient to the plague of mites, is left weak and ailing by other factors, which lower its resistance.  No wonder so many hives don't make it through the winter.Linda and I won't be getting bees from him this year.  He lost 21 of his 50 hives over the winter.  He will have to concentrate all year on building back his foundation stock.  I won't be setting up the two hives I wanted this year. I'm going to have to restock my one hive. But I've learned tons this year and that knowledge will hopefully make me a better keeper of my bees. You would think that we would be totally frustrated by all this bad news -- be ready to throw in the towel.  We're not.  Everyone who raises bees has to stick with it.  Using local bees and being diligent about what they eat and where you place them; letting your lawns go to dandelions and clover; re-queening every other year - all these things will help bring back our bees.  We need to make sure local, state and federal government does not take away our right to raise bees.  Look into your local zoning.  Know what local farmers are spraying on their crops.  Read labels.  Write letters.  Get involved."},
{"title": "How odd.", "date": "Thursday, April 14, 2011", "text": "I was thinking today (ouch) how amazing and odd it is that so many of us have developed rather close friendships and ties with people we have never seen.  I have my list of bloggers whose blogs I read every day (or whenever they post) without fail.  I laugh with them, cry with them, and send them virtual hugs.  When I first worked for a real business - I count that as when I could no longer wear jeans to work - I would have to answer the phone and direct callers to the different departments.  It was a mind-numbing, thankless, boring job.  But I got through it by trying to picture each caller by the sound of their voice.  Now, with the Internet, I try to picture each blogger by the sound of her/his writing.  I am loathe to have my picture taken.  I have not been photogenic since I was in my 20s, and even then it was sketchy.  So, I am usually the one on the business side of the camera.  However, since I have never been one to turn down a dare, here is a picture of me.  Granted, it's not great -- and rather fuzzy.  It was taken last year by ... me (notice the floating camera).  You cannot see the grey in my hair, but it's there, all right.  And I have earned every strand."},

{"title": "A Convoluted Post.", "date": "Tuesday, April 12, 2011", "text": "It happens, sometimes.  I read a great blog post that starts me down Memory Lane, which then oddly coincides with the next thing I read online.  My friend, Sylvie, would say it's the sixth sense kicking in (in a very mild way).  I would say it's co-inky-dinks.This post, by one of my favorite bloggers, dealt with your first real job, what you did and what you were paid to do it.  That got me thinking about all of the 'odd' jobs I have had over the years, leading, eventually, of me thinking about my short-lived stint as a camp cook.  I actually loved that job - it was cooking (good) for kids (good) on great, big, wonderful industrial strength machines (good) for a tasteless, megalomaniac (bad) who was the wife of the guy that ran the camp.  I would zip into the kitchen in the wee hours to whip up a giant batch of Tollhouse cookies or breakfast muffins.  I can humbly say that the kids loved me.  I think that was the beginning of the end.  Mrs. Crabcakes (let's just call her that, shall we?) did not exude warmth and was NOT a favorite of the campers.  The inevitable happened - she invaded my space (the kitchen), tasted my macaroni and cheese (NOT from a box) and told me it was bland.  She then -- in front of my very eyes -- dumped a half cup of garlic powder into it.  She was lucky I was not holding or standing near a sharp object.  I refused to serve the campers the mac 'n garlic, took off my apron and walked out.  I heard there was an uprising once the kids (and their parents, who were there for parents' day) got a whiff of dinner.All this long rambling to lead to the article I read right after this remembrance.  It was about a Chicago area school that banned homemade, home-packed lunches.  The principal of the school said she was doing it for the kids' sake - and the sake of their good nutrition.  Then the article proceeded to list what the school considered as good nutrition.  Those poor kids -- faced with mystery meat or nothing?  Lots will eat nothing.  And, as was noted in the article and several sidebar articles, that will not help them with their ability to learn.  In some ways, I can see what the principal is trying to do.  Lots of the kids were bringing sodas and chips for lunch.  Not a vegetable in view, unless you want to count the unknown make-up of the chips.  I know that it's not easy to prepare everything from scratch and keep your costs in line, but it ain't impossible!  There seems to be no knowledge of food, health, or creativity involved in school lunches, for the most part.  In California, there are programs (as, I'm sure, there are in other parts of the country) and collaborations where school lunches are good tasting and good for you and the kids even like them!  And then, what about these kids' parents?  What, you can't put together a PBJ on grained bread with some fruit and yogurt?  And not that squirtable yogurt stick thingy.  Grump.  Of course, I could go off on my crotchety old-lady rant about how kids are allowed to choose their foods and tend to only want chicken nuggets and ketchup.  But I won't.  Heehee -- did!  What's your take on all this?"},
{"title": "Just a typical weekend on the homestead.", "date": "Monday, April 11, 2011", "text": "I will have to say, in this weekend's defense, that the weather was glorious -- a perfect spring day with warm sun and light breezes.  It started off with Scrappy showing signs of a urinary infection.  This, after a week of me ranting and raving at what I perceived to be his 'bad' behavior.  Bad me.  Of course, the jury's still out on this.  I managed to get the vet to agree to me driving him up (45 mins each way) for a urine collection that would be sent out to their lab.  I arrived with 5 minutes to spare, to be told that the lab truck had been a half hour early.  So, Scrappy and I went to get cheap gas, a coffee for me and three Munchkins for him.  There is a scarcity of vets near me, and I do like this group except for the fact that they are so far away.  Incidents like this, however, make me rethink sticking with them.Besides all the extra driving, I did manage to plant onion sets and mulch them; rake off some of the mulch from my garlic, which is coming up nicely; go grocery shopping, where I lost my mind and spent close to $75 on fruit, vegetables and ingredients for my Sunday dinner.  I am weak.  I did some laundry and hung it out on my laundry tree, cleaned up the front yard and took stock of all the damage caused by this winter - three new blueberry bushes snapped in half, branches broken, bent and bruised.  I still have a huge mound of snow in the shady spot in front of the house, and at one end of the other side of the front.  I also found, much to my delight, that Manuel started up almost immediately!  This, after not being run or moved since last fall.  Ole, Manuel!I planted peas, too, and discovered that the spinach I had planted under cover last fall was still perking along, albeit pretty flattened.  So I uncovered it and it's popped right up.  I buried Ginger, the rabbit, who had langquished frozen until I could dig a proper hole.  I cleaned out the rabbit cages and trimmed some horrendous mats off Little Brother.  I took a huge load of trash and recycleables to the transfer station and, when I returned, I was thinking about taking a nice, long shower, sweeping off my deck, and then starting up dinner preparations, when I heard the unmistakable poultry alarm.  I raced into the poultry yard and found all the chickens gathered in a semi-circle outside of the coop, staring at it.  Yep.  Mink #2.  So I quickly closed it in and called my neighbor.  While I was waiting for him to arrive, another neighbor backed into the drive with my new-to-me, double spinning composter.  They were not using it and would not take anything in trade or cash for it.  Good golly.  Once I figure out where it's going and get it set up, I will post a picture so you can all be totally jealous.  Then another neighbor pulled in to pick up my tiller and shovel up llama beans.  And other neighbor pulled in to say hi.  And Kay pulled up to give me pansies (thank you again, Kay - they are beeutiful).  Then I raced in to take a shower, while Kay sat guard, and Marianne showed up with wine and Hummingbird Cake.  Then the armed neighbor showed up and he dispatched the mink.  Another healthy male specimen.  My new motto may be, \"If It's Sunday, It's Mink\".  I sure hope not...While Marianne was here, we autopsied my bee hive.  They were, indeed, all dead.  It appears there was too much moisture trapped in the hive.  The only upside of this is that it happened early and the hive was filled with honey.  It will be interesting to see just how much there is, but we figure there will be over 4 gallons.  An expensive lesson learned, both in bee deaths and $$.  But it is a lesson -- be sure that there is enough ventilation to allow moisture to escape.  The bees had sealed the vent in the inner cover with propolis, and the entrance and screened bottom board had been too often covered with snow.  There was no place for the moisture to go.  I hadn't known the ventilation was sealed off at the top, as I was told not to open it AT ALL during the winter.  You better believe I will be checking it when weather allows on the next hives.Sylvia showed up, also bearing wine, to see the lambs and have dinner, then we went inside an enjoyed a nice bottle of wine, with rabbit braised in white wine with olives and lemon, and lots of great conversation.  We topped it off with Marianne's Hummingbird Cake - my new favorite cake!  It was a non-stop and eventful weekend, some good, some bad."},

Marianne, Melanie and I - and we have picked up pigs, dropped off a variety of life poultry to be picked up packaged, visited farms, tasted cheese, bought strawberry plants, put lots of miles on Marianne's truck.  The latest road trip was of the former variety - pig pick-up.  Marianne raises Tamworth pigs, a truly marvelous animal in all respects.  They are smart, not too huge, very attractive pigs with their red hair and blue eyes, and, most important, provide the best pork I have ever eaten.  Marianne has had to go through the long, frustrating process of trying to find young pigs to raise every year.  They are not easy to find, being a relatively rare breed.  And Marianne is not one to sully purebred genes, if she can help it.  She had found some very nice Tamworths a couple of years ago and held onto one of the gilts (young female) with the intention of breeding her and raising the piglets herself.  Because she did not have a barn, she ended up having to trade a neighboring farmer her gilt to breed in exchange for a number of piglets in the spring.  He bred her late, and Marianne ended up having to raise her pigs well into the winter.  Enough!, she said.  Soooo....to make a long story relatively shorter, she had a barn built, saved two gilts from this year's herd and found herself a purebred Tamworth breeding boar.  In Pennsylvania.We were each wearing six layers of winter clothes when we left NY.  M had to keep both hands on the steering wheel, so she couldn't grab my camera!Since she voiced her intent on driving down and back in one day to fetch him - by herself - I, being ever eager to go Traveling with Marianne, offered to take a vacation day and go along for moral support, help in emergencies, and for comic relief.  We were all set for a Tuesday trip when, whizzbang out of the blue, Marianne's gilts went into heat on Sunday.  Apparently, there is a very small window of opportunity for breeding once the gilt is in heat.  So...we left early Monday morning.The trip began in minus double digits, as Sunday night was the coldest on local record for quite some time.  I basically had time to throw hay at the sheep, throw feed in the closed-up coops, hook up fresh water bottles for the rabbits (which, I am sure, refroze in minutes) and race out the door.  Five hours and three states later, we located the farm and met the farmer who was holding the boar for Marianne.  It was quite a spread - big barn, lots of acres, perfectly neat and tidy, with it's new house, outbuildings, fences.  The boar was smaller than we thought he would be and even for his age.  And there were other issues which I won't address here, as it gets me (and M) steamed just to think about it.  But he went easily into the back of her pickup, which was crammed with nice, fresh hay.  G buried his snout in it and sighed.  He made a nice nest and settled in for the ride back.  We decided (notice how I am so proprietary with M's pig) to name him Giovanni, hoping that the mere name would endow him with successful romantic accomplishments.The farmer's wonderful red border collie with a Tamworth charge.Five hours and three states later - but this time with pig shine-ola on our boots in a warm, closed truck cab - we arrived at her farm in the dark.  Thank goodness for four wheel drive, as M had to power up an unlit, snowy hill to her barn.  Where we were met by her two gilts...outside!  (Enclosed in an electronet fence, however)  Apparently, they had  maneuvered a board or two on their pen and had gone on a little adventure down the drive and into the road.  Some very nice neighbors were able to herd them back up to the barn and into the fencing.  What ensued after our arrival was not what M had had in mind.  I, by contrast, had nothing on my mind, being totally numb.  The two, larger PMS-ing pigs attacked G at every turn.  They bit him bloody.  M found that, contrary to what she had been told, G had had no experience with electric fencing, so he plowed right through it.  Thank goodness Melanie had met us there!  I wimped out after half an hour, my excuse being having left the dogs alone for over 12 hours.  (Now, don't think I'm a cruel, uncaring person - my neighbor and frister, Kay, had bravely come over to let them out in the afternoon.)  It was -8 degrees when I left, with M and M struggling to put the girls back in, keep the boy from heading down the drive and setting up a place for him to stay that was NOT with the girls.  It all resolved itself after I was safely home, and I got a lovely loaf of bread out of it to boot (thank you, Melanie!)  Unfortunately, I spend so much time gawking that I forget to take pictures even when I remember to bring my camera.  Maybe next adventure.  For now, I have filed another exciting  road trip with Marianne in my favorite memories album.  I hope there are many more to come...that don't necessarily involve pig shine-ola on my shoes in a warm, enclosed space."},

None of the ingredients are from China.  Most of the ingredients (with the exception of oats - from Canada) are grown in Massachusetts.  Plus, it is reasonable in an age of rocketing feed prices and they are really, really, really nice people.  It is a no-frills place, a big, barn-like structure with an open bay that you back into.  Robby is always grinding feed and filling bags when I pull in - covered in dust with a big smile.  They heat their little office with a small wood burning stove and receipts are hand-written.  They also load your car/truck.  It's only a 15-20 minute drive, which is equal to a hop, skip & jump where I live.If I ordered even more, I could custom-mix my feed.  If I COULD afford to order more at a time, I would add more calcium and add kelp meal.  But, for my small flock, it is easier to just add it myself.  I also add Diatomaceous Earth (food grade) to keep parasites at a minimum.  Rule of thumb?  Every time I start to see a messy chicken butt, I add DE to their feed.  So far (fingers crossed) it works like a charm.My road - before dump truck traffic.Eating snowflakes.﻿ Is it time to go home yet?﻿Just a dusting of snow on Sunday - woke up to 8+ inches this morning (Tuesday).  Sunday mornings are so nice to walk the dogs -- almost everyone but the farmers are sleeping in, there are no dump trucks roiling up the road, and we get to surprise turkeys and deer.  This causes Bernie to go straight up and forward, so I have to be on my toes, or I'll end up on my tush.  Bernie loves, loves, loves snow.  She leaps and dives into it, shoves her whole head into a snow bank and is downright frisky.  Scrappy?  Not so much.  Actually, not at all.  He is high drama in the snow.  I can tell when he's had enough -- he begins to slow down, then a slight limp appears.  The limp is then magnified by 1000 and the offended paw begins to tremble.  And, if I don't come to his aid within nanoseconds, his whole being trembles.  I have to take my gloves off, coo and croon sweet nothings in his ear, while rubbing the offended paw.  Then we all turn around and he prances home.  Character."},

{"title": "Hold onto your hats, I've been ruminating.", "date": "Friday, October 15, 2010", "text": "I was raised in a small x-burb of a smallish city in Ohio.  We lived in one of those unimaginative tract developments laid out with a t-square in what once was farmland.  There was one main street with side streets laid at right angles, all ending on a narrow dirt track that ran parallel along a forlorn strip of woods at the end of the side roads.  To the north was Lake Erie, to the south were fields.  In the early days, it was a place of young families, stay-at-home-moms, carpooling, and bridge players.  Everyone was in the same boat and kids ran around freely with neighborly supervision.  Mothers came out at dinner time and called you in.  And, depending on the season, you hightailed it in with frozen fingers and toes, or you dragged your feet, scratched a trail behind you with a stick, and did just about anything but hurry.  As we grew up, families sold and moved to areas with better school systems and the development suffered.Many years and many moves later, I have ended up in upstate New York - not to be confused in any way with downstate - in a small village within a small town.  This village in which I live has a lot of that same sense of community with which I grew up.  While everyone knows your business, they also know when someone has hit hard times, due to illness, loss of work, or just bad luck.  There are five churches in the town/village, and all congregations reach out to those who need them.  There are movie nights for free family entertainment, clothing drives, a food pantry.  When word gets out that a family has been struck by illness, there is a line of of local women bearing casseroles, cakes, roasts and side dishes at their front door.  I am blessed with amazing friends and good neighbors.  I really love it here.  (Other than the fact that NY State is the top Nanny State, over-regulated, over-taxed, governed by idiots.)Before I moved here, I lived in a small town just one county further south.  I lived there for seven years and, in that time, I made one friend - Maggie, who I still cherish.  And she lived in another town.  No one helped each other.  There were feuds and fights and nasty letters in the local paper.  It has made me wonder what makes such a difference in small towns that are so close, geographically speaking.The pre-here town (p-town) had a long history and had flourished with its mills and businesses back in the day.  Now-town (n-town) has a long history and flourished with mills and businesses back in the day.  Both lost most of their industries and have struggled for years.  P-town is closer to The City, and now has a lot of full-time City residents - especially after 9-11.  There is a big disparity between the wealthy cityfolks and poor townfolks.  N-town also has its wealthy residents, but they tend to be artists and writers who like the anonymity of a very rural setting.  We've got lots of \"hollers\" here - dirt roads that lead way back, up the mountains - and that is where they settle.  From my non-scientific study, it seems that the biggest difference is that the families here tend to stick around for generations; it's not unusual for three or four generations to still be living within a mile of each other.  Back in p-town, as soon as they're able, the young people skedaddle and don't look back.  Another difference - and I may be way off here - is that n-town is basically a rural, farming community and there is an ingrained sense of dignity and the worth of hard work that infuses a lot of the families here.  Of course, there are slackers and drunks and crooks, too, but they have very little impact on the solid sense of community of the place.  P-town is more settled, with more affluent towns clustered around it.  It just seemed angry and envious and petty.  There was a pervading sense of resentment and entitlement.  I was very glad to leave.I am curious to know what you think makes a good sense of community.  I've lived in small, medium and very large cities with the contrasting large, small, smaller sense of community in each.  I am not a romantic when it comes to farms, farming and farmers.  It's dirty, hard work and there is no time off for good behaviour.  Is it this shared hardship that brings out that intimacy that seems to be shared in this little village?"},

It reflects the personalities of the people who live there - generous, warm, fun and hard-working. My visits are always too short and it's one of those places where you just don't want to leave once you get there. Their Icelandic sheep are wonderful and it's so calming to stand on the upper pasture and watch their little butts in the air, wooly heads down. They are guarded by a quartet of llamas and they have a glorious view. Bliss. You know your sheep has had a wonderful head start.I am back from my Fun Fabulous weekend with Friends!  I took pictures and will post them later.  Other than the five-hour drive which is about 90% Interstate driving, it was a great escape to one of my favorite places.  I was thoroughly annointed with large, wet Scottish Deerhound noses, ate wonderful meals prepared by someone else! on a porch with an amazing vista, learned how to use my on-loan spinning wheel, read more than 6 pages in my book, knitted, talked, relaxed.  I was amazed it was only about a day and a half.  I made it home safely with my small charge - Bartlett - a spotted moorit ram lamb.  He was a very good sport about the long drive; especially the snake-like final portion of the trip.  I was so anxious to get home, that it took me a while to realize that the sound I was hearing - slide, thump, clackety-clack, slide, thump - was Bartlett sliding from side to side in his dog kennel when I cornered the bends.  My friend, Rosie, had everything in hand and helped me get the squirt into the hoop house, where he will be able to meet everyone at a safe distance.  I had forgotten how small lambs were at this age (5 months).  It was good to get home."},

For those things that I don't dare forget (turn off hose; unplug electric fence), I use a blackboard. I have made lists since I was a teenager because it was fun and satisfying to put things in order.  Now that I am going in twelve directions at once, I HAVE to make lists or there is no order in my life (well....).  Along with my many lists, I developed the habit of keeping an \"Egg Journal\".  It's a journal in the most basic, simplistic terms.  For some reason long forgotten, I have been logging in my hens' egg-laying accomplishments since I moved into this house, raised chickens and found my first egg.  It goes back about 4 years and includes the morning outside temperature, date, number of eggs collected that day, and a brief summary of the weather.  Heaven only knows why I started it, but I have stuck with it day after day, week after week.  It has actually been an interesting research tool, in that I can go back 1-2-3-4 years to the day and see what the weather was like.  Every once in a while, there is an additional notation - Lulu died; two broken eggs; forgot to close gate - that can almost always bring me back to that day.       What is it about habits, anyway?  Good ones  limp along miserably for a couple of weeks, then go die in a dark, lonely corner.  Bad habits roar into life and stick to me like Gorilla Glue.AFTER superglue on head woundEven by Monday standards, yesterday was the worst. I discovered a wasp nest in the sheep's hoop house by getting stung twice in the back of my head. Then I came home to a voicemail from Jordan with the worst possible news. As I was throwing hay and feed around so I could leave to go up to her farm, I discovered one of the Cordon Bleus had been cornered and practically scalped by the other hens. I quickly put her in a rabbit cage, brought her into the laundry room, dabbed at her bloody head and headed up the mountain. Words escape me, too. The horrors of what Jordan found even got to the state trooper and my friend, the dog warden, who has seen it all. There was little comfort I could give Jordan, other than to reassure her that there was nothing she could have done. Once a dog turns vicious predator, as her neighbor's dog did, there is nothing that will stand in its way. When I came home later, my scalped chicken was still pretty perky, so I called my neighbor to consult on how to address this gaping head wound. She came over with super glue and we glued the skin back together. There's still a wound, but she's safe from flies, has food and water, and I clean the wound with peroxide twice a day. This morning, before sun-up, I went out to the hoop house with a paper bag, knocked the wasp nest into it, took it out to the driveway and burned the sucker."},

The sheep were backlit giving them a golden aura, the cows were grazing on a section of new grass, and farming seemed like the best possible way to live. I don’t feel tied down. I feel uprooted when I have to leave.\" Exactly and amen.I love that word, but seldom find the occasion to use it.  And now, unfortunately, I feel it is the perfect word to describe how I feel about my much-too-short relationship with Gigi.  I am very attached to all my companions - I flatly love them.  They comprise my immediate family and our relationships parallel all the two-legged relationships I have and have had.  They have spats, they misbehave, they forgive me if I misbehave, they make me laugh.  But the one thing they give me that no person does is unconditional love.  How astonishing that a small, feral cat who populated my life for such a short time would have such a hold on my heart?  I have such a clear image of the last morning I saw her - she was lying warmly against me on the sofa.  I was scratching the distinctive pattern on the top of her head when she raised her head, looked at me through squinted eyes and rumbled her amazingly loud purr.  She had kohl lined eyes and a sweet smudgy patch on her chin.  And now she is gone.  We had been working on making her an indoor-only cat, but the process wasn't completed.  I had one other outdoor cat who engendered that much love, and he disappeared as well.  It was a long, painful process, forgetting that loss.  And it will be a long and painful process with Gigi's loss as well.  I will hear her mewing at the back door, under my bedroom window, out in the poultry yard.  I will see her out of the corner of my eye.  Not knowing how it ended leaves you with the hope that it hasn't.  And hope, in that sense, becomes a form of purgatory."},

{"title": "Raw Milk Moooooves Me.", "date": "Friday, July 30, 2010", "text": "Since I seem to be on a roll, I thought I'd add my two cents to the blogosphere on the subject of raw milk.  I have done a lot of reading on this subject, and I have had some very 'interesting' discussions about it.  Personally, I am a big fan and I drink raw milk.  I'm sure that some of the impetus that got me going in that direction - besides the superior taste and health benefits - is that, once a hippie, always a hippie.  By that I mean that I still bristle at what I feel is too much government regulation of my life and likes.  Some of those 'likes' are long gone, but I am still very much interested in small farms/farmers, natural health care, organic/naturally grown good food, and supporting anything that will bring us back to some sense of peace and natural order.  I am very lucky to live in a very small town, in a very rural area.  My friends and neighbors are small dairy farmers, organic vegetable farmers, raisers of pasture-fed poultry and beef.  Most of my friends now have bees, good-sized gardens, and are good friends to their communities.  I have a sweet Jersey heifer named Jasmine, who is due to freshen sometime in February.  When she does, I will have a sumptuous supply of rich, creamy Jersey milk with which to make cheese, butter, yogurt -- the possibilities are endless!  Until she freshens, I barter for milk with the farmer who is housing her for me.  I help at the farm, give them eggs, bake something for the barn every Sunday morning.       As with all things controversial, I am a firm believer in every person's right to choose what is best for them.  I listened to a recent news 'blip' on NPR recently, where they discussed -- well, discussion is not what the radio offers any longer -- let's just say that they presented two, short, unsurprising viewpoints from two unsurprising sources.  Neither did the subject justice.  On the Pro side, there was a new-agey mother who gallops off to the local dairy (in another state) with her two-year-old to buy raw milk for his snack.  She is outraged that she can buy fast food around every corner and not find raw milk in her neighborhood.  She does not explain in any detail why she feels she needs to drink raw milk.  As a matter of fact, she doesn't indicate whether she drinks it herself.  On the Anti side, they dusted off a government official who said what all government officials say - \"we are protecting you from yourself; we know what's best; you will get sick and may die if you drink raw milk.\"  I was very disappointed that NPR did not take the opportunity to illuminate more of the benefits with someone knowledgeable on the topic, while finding someone who could make a more compelling argument for why one shouldn't drink it.  (Hippie me speaking here again.)     I ordered The Untold Story of Milk by Ron Schmid from the library, as I read a review by Joann Grohman, written in her unmistakably intelligent and well-informed manner, and it piqued my interest.  It is a very compelling read.  If you are interested in the subject, I would suggest you read this book, as well as any one of Mrs. Grohman's articles on the subject.  You can find her web site here:  real-food.com  She is the poster woman for a raw milk diet.  In her early 80s, she writes and commentates on a variety of subjects, while milking her own Jersey cow twice a day, every day, in every kind of weather.  She has, if you will, written THE book on milk cows and raw milk.  For anyone seriously considering adding raw milk to their diet, I would say this -- make sure you are informed.  Doing your due diligence, using common sense and making informed decisions will keep you in good stead.  I know my farmer's cows, I have watched him milk them, he and his father and his grandfather before him have raised their families on their own raw milk.  That's good enough for me.  Scrappy the Wonder Dog is happy to announce that Kim and Mama Pea will be sporting sparkling new dishcloths in their kitchens!  PM your mailing address to me at swomersley at gmail dot com and they will be on their way.  Thanks for joining in!"},

Sure, she was still eating and drinking, but she could not stand, walk or get out of her own way. One night I went out as usual, didn't see her in her enclosure, so assumed she had gotten into her house for the night as she always does. I locked the door and made the rest of my rounds. The next morning she was not in her house. I searched all over and found her wedged behind the bunny hutch, wet from the night's rain - looking very bedraggled. But still \"perky\". I had to suck it up and admit I was a wimp. I called my neighbor and asked him to come over and dispatch Pearly Mae. I know that I have to see to my own business and I've promised myself I will not call in the Marines the next time I am faced with this problem and will address it much earlier on. I think a lot of my cowardice comes from equal parts:  fear and ignorance. Fear that I will somehow botch the job and make the suffering worse, and ignorance of what is the best and most humane way to end a chicken's life. Sure, I know all the processing methods - quick chop/sharp axe, broom handle/foot, cone/knife - I've got the books. But this (at least to me) is different. Maybe that's where I'm going wrong. I had better arm myself better for the future - knowledge-wise, that is.       Grendal is now off her nest of clunkers.  She came out of the nesting box loaded for bear and aimed straight for Alfie.  She pulled his head feathers; she jumped on him and bit him; she chased him around the yard.  In my best anthropomorphic manner, I imagined she was giving him hell for not providing the 'necessary ingredients' for fertile eggs.  In his defense, he is just a year old and not likely to be up to the task in the first place.  That does not, however, mean that he is not enjoying the process, if you catch my drift.  She had been setting on them for a month and a half and, recently, a crushed, rotten eggshell was found discarded outside of her nesting spot every other day or so.  There were two suspicious specimens left in her nest so I made the executive decision to cease incubation.  I have closed off access to her nest and will deal with the stinking mess another time.  It'll go right at the top of my to-do list.  Not.  Dottie's eggs came to naught as well.  Looks like next year will be the year of the ducklings.  Let's hope Alfie sees the light by then.My friend/neighbor Kayten brought me a gift a couple of weeks ago.  When she called and asked, \"are you going to be home? -- I have a present for you!\"  I had an inkling of what was coming.  That, and she was coming from the Massachusetts Sheep and Woolcraft Fair.  When she and her husband, Nick, walked up my driveway carrying a small cardboard box, I couldn't help myself - I was excited!  In the box was a small, incredibly fluffy, 6 week old, male French/German Giant cross.  Adorable.  I haven't introduced him because I have been trying to find his name for the past two weeks.  Some of the names I tried out on him were:  Fluffy (eck), Sweet Baby James (too long), Alfie (taken - drake), Little Bit (he'd grow - quite a bit, I imagine), Bento (my Japanese phase), and on it went.Since he is a youngster, I am taking the time to handle him and it has led me to an interesting place.  With my crowded schedule, full time job, and looming surgery, I was spending every morning and evening racing from one chore to the next, and trying to squeeze in every item on my to-do list that I could shoehorn into my limited at-home time.  One of the things I decided to squeeze in, was to spend a couple of minutes taking the bunny out of his hutch and holding him.  After the second morning, I found myself cuddling the little fat, warm fuzzball, leaning against the fence and watching the meanderings of the chickens.  A couple of minutes turned into 5, which turned into 10.  A few mornings ago, while I was stroking his lovely, soft fur and giving him a blow-by-blow description of the obviously loving relationship that has developed between Dottie and Alfie (censored to fit his young ears), I looked down and realized he was dozing in my arms.  I also noticed that his under-fur was a beautiful blue-gray color.  Little Blue.  I realized it had been ages since I had taken the time to enjoy my chickens, ducks, sheep, llama, cats and dogs.  I still have to fit a lot into my mornings, but I am enjoying my bit of down time with Blue, watching chicken television."},

Ymmmmmm.  Gigi decided I was spending way too much time photographing garlic scapes when she was right there in front of me.  Waiting for dinner, no doubt.  How she managed to stay dry in the downpours, I have no idea.  She will not enter the barn since Joey arrived.  Sigh. Today has been one storm followed by another.  Bernie has taken up permanent residence under the bed, Gigi is miserable and I have cleaned the house.  During one brief dry spell - with actual sun - I raced outside and made trellises out of some cattle panels (bolt cutters -  a must-have tool), quickly tied them to the rebar posts and put up fencing around the last raised bed.  Lawdamercy, I made it in the house with seconds to spare before it started up again - thunder, gusty wind and torrents of rain.  You can sort of see the garden in the picture above - taken through the window.  Normally, I wouldn't mind a rainy day - it makes you stop and rest.  Or clean the house.  But when each storm brings with it the threat of high winds and flooding, it gets on your nerves!  On the next break, I have to sprint out to the chicken coop and close the people door.  I'm sure it's flooded by now.  I am going to work on getting Gigi to come inside.  I'm sure it will be 'exciting'.  But she is obviously not a feral cat, and there is no reason for her to be trying to find a dry spot, and me listening for coyotes all night."},

I love my chickens and there is nothing that I love more than walking out my back door and seeing all my hens racing towards me. Food Lady!!! But they can be a real challenge when something goes off-kilter. Such as one of my Barred Rock hens finding herself on the other side of the fence. I am not sure how she managed it, but she did. I have spent three days trying to catch her, herd her, reason with her, and trick her. It hasn't helped that I have been so bone-tired that my limited agility was almost non-existent, and I managed to fluster her more with each attempt to grab her. I couldn't leave the gate open because they would ALL get out and decimate my front yard in it's fragile garden-ness. And every night that she was not in the security of the coop, I heard the coyotes howling. And mysterious, ominous rustlings. ALL night. This is a good example of why I am not a parent. I would be institutionalized by now. This morning, while I made my rounds (I work from left to right), I glimpsed a flash of black and white on the gated side of the fence. Hurrah! I silently went over and opened the gate a crack - then busied myself with my patient, Pearly Mae, and the ducks. Sure enough, the hen came in through the gate. I raced over and slammed the gate shut and locked it. Back, safe and sound. Unfortunately, while I 'won' that round, I lost Millie, my angora rabbit. There were no signs that I could read that she wasn't well - she was eating, drinking, she had shade and shelter and chicken t.v. When I came home last night and went out to check her food, she was gone. My lovely, soft, white rabbit. It just broke my heart and I keep thinking there should have been something I could have done or noticed. I have gotten better at taking my losses, but some are harder to take than others."},
{"title": "Slow Food.", "date": "Wednesday, May 26, 2010", "text": "As recently as five years ago, the thought of raising my own food (other than gardening) would have seemed completely alien to me.  Even when I started raising chickens, about 12 years ago, they were for egg production only.  Everyone had a name and when one succumbed to SCUDS (sudden chicken unexplained death syndrome) I would tearfully dig a hole and bury her in the back yard.  When I moved to this small homestead and decided to become as self-sustaining as I could manage, I began to look at how and what I ate, what resources I had and started raising chickens for meat.  These chicks, pictured above, are slow-growing red and slow-growing white roasters.  (And, yes, that's a washing machine dial in the background.  Don't ask.)  I had to reconcile that these cute, downy chicks were future entrees.  As hard as it was in the beginning, after tasting the difference between store-bought chicken and home-raised chicken, I was a convert.  As long as I continue to eat chicken, I will continue to raise my own.  I do not, however, process my own chickens.  That's a line over which I have not been able to step.  I use a fellow about an hour away who has a family-run, humane poultry processing business and I am entertained by his many children while the processing takes place.  My other forays into raising my own non-plant food has not always been successful.  Last year's quail experiment resulted in weeks of interrupted sleep (male quail are LOUD and LOUD at all hours of the night), this year's turkey experiment was also a bomb (my breeding pair turned out to be two males who were LOUD and LOUD constantly), my Guinea Forest Hogs (Ethel and Kate) were too cute and smart to be food, I lost Ethel to an aneurysm and Kate went off to help repopulate the breed in Virginia, and the ducks - Puff's surprise hatch of 10, mostly male offspring (who were LOUD.  Constantly.)  I'm seeing a pattern here - you, too?  Now, I happen to eat duck, turkey and pork.  Quail?  Not so much.  So my turkeys are in the freezer, I 'raise' a pig cooperatively with friends, and I'm going to try ducks again - this time with a Muscovy hen and a Pekin drake.  I'm hoping the ducklings inherit their mother's Muscovy quiet trait."},

{"title": "Working Alone", "date": "Monday, May 24, 2010", "text": "I have a lot of friends who help me. Lots. And I am so thankful for that, I can't even begin to thank them all. But there are many times when I end up working alone. Depending on the undertaking, sometimes it's very nice to work by myself -- I can get into a nice rhythm and let my mind loose to go wherever it wants (although, that can be pretty scary). This weekend, however, I was faced with a bigger job -- having to finish off the hayport so that Gigi could be let out of her crate into the larger 'crate' of the inside of the hayport. She has been sweet and patient, but it's been two weeks of confinement and she's getting pudgy and bored. Sort of like me by the end of winter ;o) I went through the usual shenanigans of dealing with well-meaning but condescending guys at Home Depot and wrestling the 4x8 foot sheets of T-111 off the truck - all the time being conscious to NOT use my left shoulder. Then the last sheet slipped off the back and landed on my 'panel-helper' - a very useful and nifty tool my dad gave me that allows me to carry large sheets of things by myself. And crushed it. So, being the stoic that I am, I cried. A little. Then strong-armed the panels to the opposite end of the hayport where my sawhorses were set up. The sawhorses kept getting knocked over while I tried to maneuver the sheets on top of them. What to do. More cursing and whining. Voila! A step-in post or two propped up one end while I tilted the other on the horses. Then I did a mighty fine job of trimming the sheets so they would fit along the curved roof of the hayport. Mighty fine, by my standards, of course. Then I screwed them into the frame I had built on Saturday morning and put another sheet across the future door, screwing it in with the help of the now-very-handy step-in posts. All during this long, hot, sweaty process, Gigi sat curled on her bed in her crate, silent, giving me a large-dark-eyed stare. I'm not sure if it was because of the noise of the tools, or the surrounding air, colored quite a dark blue by my running commentary. During the entire process, the sheep bleated, the llama hummed, and Scrappy followed me from window to window, yipping incessantly. He does this so that I will get infuriated and come inside and yell at him. Which I finally did - but, luckily for him, I was so exhausted, all I could do was shake a shaky fist in his general direction. This morning I finished the job with a poorly constructed but adequate door covered in chicken wire so she can look out at her future domain without quite venturing out yet. More for my peace of mine than hers, of course. After I fed her, I left her crate door open and closed and latched the wire door. One small step for cats - one giant step for cat-caregivers."},
{"title": "Poultry Relationships", "date": "Thursday, May 20, 2010", "text": "There is so much drama on a homestead when one has poultry. Or so it seems to me. I have enough room in a large fenced side-yard to give everyone their 'space'. But, as in human relationships, there are just some personalities that don't mesh. For the most part, Alfie, my Pekin drake, could care less about the chickens. They are mildly annoying when they are crowded around the waterers, and they will attempt to run him over if he stands between them and me with possible food treats. A couple of rapid quacks are the extent of his irritation. That is, until he sees Attila the Hen. Alfie HATES her. If his beady eye spies ATH in the yard, he is after her faster than a bell clapper in a goose's butt (I've been waiting to use that expression). I'm not sure if it's the fact that she's loud and puffed up all the time, or if she just exudes a certain something that he finds offensive. He chases her all over the yard, in the coop and out, and in again, until she hops back up and sits on top of Dotty. Some of the hens are drama queens and any little thing will set them off, shrieking like little girls. That sometimes will get the rest of them going and it is total cacophony until, one by one, they realize they've forgotten what all the hubbub was about. Junior is usually the last to stop - he loves a good hissy-fit.On a more sober note, little Pearlie Mae is not making progress. I put her outside, knowing that it will be warm and sunny so she won't get chilled. The rubber flooring in the infirmary may be hampering her recovery, since she can't get purchase on the slick surface. Then, again, she seems to have lost most of her muscle tone in her legs, so it's a moot point. I will have to make a decision as to keep on trying to get her mobile, or ... not. That is a very difficult decision for me, as I find it almost impossible to take life away. I've had to do it twice before and it haunted me for weeks, even though it was the right decision in both cases. Let's hope the sunshine, green grass and nice (low) bowl of water work a miracle."},
{"title": "It's Complicated.", "date": "Wednesday, May 19, 2010", "text": "The one thing I can count on is that nothing I undertake is simple. Sure, it may start out simple - say, like raising a few chickens. Before you know it, you have chickens in all manner of 'special needs'. And special needs need special housing. Right now, in my small operation, I have a) a paraplegic hen recuperating (I hope) in a redwood dog house now rigged up as the infirmary in a special fenced in area that also houses the rabbit; b) duck quarters (photo above - no comments, plz, about my carpentry skills) which include an A-frame building that they hate, my late quail cage - partially deconstructed, then adopted by Grendal the duck as her nesting spot - also fenced; c) the main coop occupied by my 20-something chickens, Junior rooster, Alfie and Puff, the odd-duck couple (both figuratively and literally) who take offense to the duck quarters and prefer the coop, Dotty Duck & Attila the Hen - nestmates, and the five pullets - the Violets, Prissie, Peanut, and Almond - who, until last night, lived in; d) the nursery coop, now occupied by Marie-Claire and Home-Chick (photo below). Each of these set-ups require their own food and water dishes, security devices (aka doors), etc. When I came in from chores yesterday morning, there was a message on my voicemail alerting me to the fact that my 12 meat chicks would be arriving this morning. Sigh. I am, however, about half-ready for them. That is quite an improvement to my previous endeavors. They will be housed NOT in my laundry room, but in a donated galvanized water tub, equipped with a hardware cloth lid, hanging heat lamp and all the appropriate accouterments - situated in my shed. Which, in turn, had to be varmintized - meaning nailing boards over large/small holes, more hardware cloth over obvious openings. The upshot of all this is - learn to plan ahead. Realistically, I never do this and, most likely, never will. Then again, I have gained all manner of new skills - chicken first aid, carpentry skills, reusing/recycling/rethinking. It's not all bad."},

Since I tied it in with my list of errands, I had pretty much discounted anything significant coming out of the meeting.  And I brought Scrappy along for added insurance.  He is (usually) my dud-finder.  On this occasion, however, he spent most of his time rolling around in the grass, waving all four paws in the air and looking ridiculous.  But he was also reserved around Mr. Saturday, so that was a red flag.  So was the non-stop monologue about himself with no questions about me, my life, likes, etc.  I hold to the belief that chemistry is VERY important, so I also count on my pheromones.  They, however, wilted under the onslaught of heavy, overpowering, cloyingly pungent aftershave.  If there had been any frisky pheromones, they didn't stand a chance.I have a couple of hens that will go broody at the drop of a hat. One, Marie-Claire, is a funny little Maran hen that's probably 3+ years old. She is a rescued hen and has a funny, wide-legged, hop-walk that is the result of being raised in a plastic tub during her formative months. She goes broody quietly and doesn't fuss when I lift her off eggs and shoo her out of the door. Then there is Attila the Hen. (Attila's golden butt is in the pic at left.) While Buff Orpingtons are usually known for their sweet natures, this lunatic turns into a mad thing when broodiness hits. She has attached herself to Dotty's little nesting box full of duck eggs and will not leave them. She puffs up and screeches when I get close and regularly squeezes herself beside, behind or on top of Dotty and her eggs. This is actually a lucking thing for Dotty who, while she makes a great 'Auntie', is sorely lacking in the broody department. I have very little hope for the four eggs she's been 'mostly' setting on. This morning, Marie-Claire had her dreams come true. Grendal, my other broody (and much better at it) Muscovy hen, managed to hatch a chicken egg while setting on her own eggs. The incubation period for chicken eggs is about 21 days. The incubation period for a Muscovy duck is over a month. So, while Grendal dashed out for a quick bite and a sip of water, I snagged the little fluff-ball and introduced it to Marie-Claire. When I tucked it under her wing, she then fluffed up and snuggled down and pecked me. I took that as a good sign. Now I have to keep a close watch on Grendal's nest, as there may be more chicks in amongst the duck eggs."},

As soon as my eyes opened, the brain snapped into gear and off it went, running lists.  This is what happens when I am under a great deal of stress.  The Chorus starts with the listing.  As much as I dislike and try to ignore the Chorus, it's always there, lurking, hopping from one foot to another waiting for it's chance.  My friend, Jordan's post about morning chores set me to thinking about my chores and how I had set myself up for stress.  Once again, I was reminded about my lack of backbone when faced with using the \"N\" word.  All you softies, over-achievers and non-delegators know which word I mean.  Sometimes, even though my logical self has the \"N\" word on it's way to my lips, the Chorus does a quick block and jumps in with, \"Why, sure I will!  Love to!!  Always wanted one!!!\"  Today I was reminded that I am not taking time to smell the roses.  My Scrappy is urinating in the house because he's unhappy/frustrated/angry - all the test results are in and it's not a physical problem.  I don't know how many chickens I have.  I haven't scritched Juno behind the ears in weeks.  My insomnia is back.  So, whoa Nelly!  The Universe is reaching out to me and I am going to listen.  On my way to work, I passed by a woman sitting quietly on her lawn, next to her very old Lab, both looking off to the distance, her arm draped around his neck.  Taking time to be together and enjoying their obvious long-time bond.  It made me teary.  And made me want to turn around and spend time with my two dogs, who haven't seen much of me lately.  And I used the \"N\" word today, even though I didn't want to.   But it was the right thing to do.  Tonight I am going to go home and spend time with the dogs.  I'm going to let Cookie drape himself over my shoulder, even though he weighs as much as a Holstein and kneads his claws in my flesh.  I will not complain while Tippet head-butts me continually.  I may count my chickens.  It's difficult to sort out priorities when your life is so full, when there's so much to do and so much you want to do -- and when you are the only one there to do everything.  But there is tomorrow.  And, if there isn't, you've lived well today."},

He haunts me in the kitchen, although I am a stern food lady and do not feed him from either my counter or my plate. But he is always hopeful and incredibly persistent. This past weekend, I was cutting up mangoes and a piece jumped off my knife. I am sure most people have heard of the 5 second rule - well, it doesn't exist in my house. If it hits the floor, it's chicken food. I live with two dogs and two cats in the country with mice. Nuff said. It's a rare piece of anything that hits the floor, though. Scrappy can home-in on a morsel mid-air like a highly developed missile-tracking device. That bit of mango never had a chance. And then there was the fun of watching him discovering that it was something foreign - something he'd never had before. I doubt if I could describe the many expressions that passed over my pooch's face as he - loathe to give it up - contemplated the mango while rolling it around in his mouth. Suffice it to say, he isn't called 'Bert Lahr in a Dog Suit' for nothing. In the end, he decided he liked it. Fast-forward a day to when I am cleaning a sinkful of ramps. One slippery devil made the plunge and again, like greased lightening, Scrappy was on it. Ramps, he discovered, are not mangoes and after he spit it out, he went looking for toothpaste and dental floss.Bernie, on the other hand, is waaaaay more subtle. She seems bored, above it all. Then you turn your back and she tiptoes in, stands up to the counter and removes whatever has been foolishly left within reach - plate and all. It's almost unnerving.I am now waiting for the results of the latest food incident - a mostly-full bag of beggin strips, those grossly artificial non-bacon things that were the worst impulse purchase I have ever made. I neglected to stow the bag and (gasp) left the house. I returned to an odd, chemical-bacon-like smell wafting about and two dogs who would not look me in the eye. It is never boring in our house."},

Not only do I have a source for ramps, but she is such a good egg that she didn't blink so much as an eyelash when I begged to go dig ramps in the pouring rain! Since the time to harvest ramps is short (and pungent) and my free time is equally short, the window was closing fast this past Saturday. And, of course, it was cold, blustery and pouring rain. My friend, a mere youngster, is not bothered by such small things, so off we went, pitchforks and buckets in hand, to slog up a long muddy road to the mother lode. (I would tell you where it is, but then I would have to kill you. So I won't.) We talked and laughed and dug bucketfuls of muddy ramps. Then we slogged down the road and washed them in a brook. More talking and laughing. By the time I had dropped her back at her place, we were both soaking wet and mud-splattered. But we each had a 5-gal bucket of lucious, aromatic ramps. Yum! Said ramps are now residing in my fridge, with half of them washed and chopped and in my freezer. It's all good."},

I bet it was all he could do to keep from rolling his eyes. \"Sure,\" he said, \"I can bring some by - you just tell me where you want me to put it.\" After figuring out the perfect spot, I relayed the information and drove off to work, happy as a clam. When I came home, there was a pile of manure approximately half the length of a football field by the side of the house. Was I horrified at this giant pile of 'aromatic' organic material?  I was not -- I was thrilled. Fast-forward three years and I am shoveling up piles of black gold with which to plant my fruitscape, fill my raised beds, nourish my rhubarb. And I am working on a new pile of black gold, albeit a smaller one.  I've learned to ask for manure in the summer, while the herd is mostly outside during the day.  The accumulation in the barn is much more manageable. I figure I can't lose with my dynamic combination of cow, sheep, llama, and chicken manures. Woot!!"},

And, as I get older, I realize that I am very fortunate to still have both my mother and father in my life.  We are a small, close family that seems to get closer every year.  I absolutely and completely love my mother - she has such a wicked sense of humor, is much too self-effacing, is completely open-hearted, fair-minded and very loving.  Happy Mother's Day, Mom.As it is every spring, all the tender green leaves seem to pop out overnight. I love the color of the early leaves - so indescribably tender green. This is the view down my road. I am always grateful that I ended up in such a beautiful place. My morning and evening walks with the dogs allow me to center, calm down, shed worries. They also allow Scrappy to 'mark' every other blade of grass, both coming and going on our long walks. He is more relaxed on our morning walk, since it is an apres breakfast walk. Evening walks are a little more - \"look, let's get going here - I've done everything and now I want dinner\" - fast-paced. Depending on the weather, Bernie is just thrilled to be outside. But thunderstorm weather makes her very anxious, so we just manage to get the basics done. Speaking of 'marking', I was thinking this morning of how much like alpha male dogs my two road neighbors are. They have nailed up countless No Trespassing signs branding their property. Makes me think of Scrappy, methodically lifting his leg on every other tree, although he has many more positive attributes than my neighbors. But, I digress. The actual morning I was waxing poetic about my tender green spring, I did not have my camera at hand. This was taken this morning and, while it still is tender and green, it has also turned into March - with low 30s and - gasp - snow this morning! We have also added a barn cat, Gigi, to the menagerie. I have decided to use \"we\" every time I add another resident because it makes it seem less like lunacy on my part if there are more people involved. Which, of course, there is not. She is the first of two I have adopted - Joey still has some recovery to do at the vet's. They were two of many barn/feral cats on a property with two barns that was sold and they all had to go or else. I ask you, how could I say no? Gigi is in a nice, large crate, with comfy thick towel, litter box, food and water. After listening to the wind howl last night as this cold front motored in, I trotted out with a wool blanket, which is now covering the crate. It's pretty cozy in there, with all the hay, but I think it's better to have a sheltered spot where she can feel less vulnerable. I will take her picture when she is more settled in."},

I can use Bernie as a barometer - just about 10 minutes before a thunderstorm hits, she begins to pace and pant. As the storm gets closer, she gets frantic and I let her into the bedroom so she can go under the bed. With the drapes pulled, windows shut and a nice, dark close space, she is safe from whatever demons frighten her. Yesterday, we went through the drill and, while I did hear some distant thunder, birds were singing, the sun was shining and it was warm and balmy. Within three minutes of Bernie's disappearance under the bed, the sky went black, the wind howled, rain and hail came in sheets, and the temperature dropped almost 20 degrees! It was amazing! Ten minutes later, it was clear. A half hour after that, Bernie emerged. That's my girl."},

Even though I know there is always a chance that it will snow before May - and sometimes during - my Pollyanna forecast failed me.  Now I have to pull my down jacket out of the to-be-washed pile, boots out of the closet and go back to winter mode.   Bernie loves the snow, so she will be especially perky this morning.  Scrappy - not so much.  And I will have the usual conversation about the weather when we walk by the dairy barn.  I am always surprised at how much there is to discuss about the weather when you're talking to a farmer.  They start at the day and project through the summer.  Farming is not for wimps, that's for sure.  And, while I type this, I am listening to our governor call for furloughs, cuts and tightening of belts.  I wonder how much more we can ask of our farmers.  Milk prices have plummeted, grain prices are still high, fuel prices on the rise again.  My neighbor said he doesn't even consider stopping dairy farming - what other job would there be?  Better to just grit your teeth and go day-to-day.  I never realized how hard a farmer works, especially dairy farmers.  There is no vacation.  There are no sick days.  You are in the barn two times a day, seven days a week, twelve months a year.  All holidays, all weekends.  Cows don't care if you have the flu.  Any romantic ideas I had of myself as a dairy farmer (especially at this age) are long gone.  But I still have my cow, thanks to the farmer.  She resides there and, after she freshens this coming January or February, I can milk her on the weekends.  It's the best deal ever.

{"title": "Beholden", "date": "Monday, April 26, 2010", "text": "Before homesteading came into my life, I spent a lot of time and effort NOT being reliant on other people. I had to be in control at all times, and could not delegate for the life of me. Single homesteading is a humbling experience. I've had to take a deep breath and ask for help. While it still gets under my skin, relying on others has taught me more than it's taken from me. I know that I've gone on (and on) about how lucky I am to have the neighbors and friends I do, but I really AM lucky. Asking for help can be difficult. Especially if you have control issues and your own time frame.With surgery looming, I mustered up my nerve, called a neighbor and said, \"HELP!!\" Vic retired and doesn't like sitting around. He showed up Friday afternoon and cut down three small gnarly trees and dug 9 holes, while I trotted behind, planting my plum trees, willow hybrids and forsythias, and transplanting my lilacs. Then he raked up all the debris, transplanted grass that had been displaced, and came back to haul away all the tree parts. Good golly.But asking for help can also bite you - another neighbor, a farmer, offered to replace the muffler on my truck. This is great news for me - a bigger non-mechanic you couldn't find - but I forgot about farming time frames. It has been almost a month and I'm still waiting. Can I complain? No. He has to make hay while the sun shines - or, in this case, disc and harrow his fields to get ready for planting corn. It's raining today, so my Pollyanna is out in full force!"},
{"title": "The Scariest Word in a Homesteader's Vocabulary", "date": "Thursday, April 22, 2010", "text": "Surgery. I don't think there is a word that strikes more fear into the heart of a single homesteader than 'surgery'. First, you go into denial - \"But I CANNOT have surgery. Who will feed the sheep? I haven't cleaned out the chicken coop yet!\" Then you panic. Then you start to make lists. What can you do ahead of time to make taking care of the million things you do each day easier? Forget all the projects that you have lined up. Once again, they are pushed to the bottom of your new list. Since I am having surgery to repair my left rotator cuff, this means that, while I'm mobile, I only will have the use of one hand/arm. That means opening my gates will be difficult, my method of feeding the sheep and llama will have to change. And I have to dig all those damn holes and plant my trees before May 5. It pays to think creatively and to break each task down into its simplest form. I have to get hay in and stacked where I can easily cut the baling twine with one hand. I have to set up a new feeding trough (will make this weekend) inside the fence so I can pour grain from the outside - Juno may be small, but she's a steamroller when it comes to food. I'll have to keep a bag of grain in the house, so I don't have to open gates and pry off lids. Etc. And, of course, this is where having great friends and neighbors becomes about the most important asset you can have as a single homesteader. For that, I am very grateful. Amen. (Did you notice that I have a 'happy' picture instead of storm clouds looming over dark water? I'm being positive. I am positive that the next six week are going to stink.)Instead of waxing all philosophical on you, I thought I would bring you up to date on some causes for small celebrations here on the homestead.  First, and foremost, the turkeys were sent to freezer camp/processed/shown the door and are now residing - quietly, thank god - in MY freezer.  They were both about 7 months old and their processed weight combined is well over 30 pounds!  That should be enough for our usual Thanksgiving family dinner for four.Next, Violet was freed from accidental captivity under the shed and is now back with her mates.  I don't know why I always have this rosy picture of siblings reunited with my poultry.  It never, ever works out that way.  It is more like - OHO, who are you?  An alien chicken - let's get her!  And they give her the once over at ever opportunity until she is convinced that she's at the bottom and lower than dirt.  Then they get over it.I included a couple of pictures of the sheep after they were shorn.  It dawned on me that it would have been a better idea to show a before and after, but that will have to wait until I wade through all my unorganized photographs.  The sheep at the feeder are (l-r) Flora, her lambs Freyda and Juno, and Coco(nut).  The close-up is of Coco(nut), my moorit ewe.  She is very skittish, but I have been working with her and she no longer races off as soon as I look at her.  I had sold her lambs last year and won't do that again.  Without at least one lamb, she was shunned for weeks by Flora and her lambs.  She ended up bonding with Hoosier who was nice about it. You can see on Coco's close-up that there's a nice layer of wool left from the blade shearing.  This, to my untrained mind, is a whole lot better when there's nights that drop to 20 degrees still in the forecast.  They also didn't seem as stressed after shearing this year.  I'm hoping that they stay reasonably clean over the summer so that I can get some quality fleeces in October.  That's hard to accomplish when you have to feed hay all year, but...hope springs eternal!"},

It covered a myriad of topics - the lack of dateable men, things going wrong in multiples. But hope is what keeps you putting your feet on the floor each morning - then carries you through your day, one foot in front of the other sometimes. Not that my days are bleak; they are not. Some are more difficult than others but I am always hopeful that the next day will be better.Spring is another comforting word. Spring is the hope that gets you through the long winter. It is what springs (sorry) to mind when I look at my little herb bed and see the sorrel, mint and loveage coming up. Gone with the brown and dead - up with the green and living! The loveage makes me think of hope.  The loveage was given to me as a start by a friend who recently battled a brain tumor. She was and is the most gentle and lovely woman I know - an artist and weaver of so much talent it leaves me in awe. Never once, through the long ordeal, did I hear her complain, ask \"why me?\", or lose her sense of humor. The first year I planted my loveage start, a neighbor's dog dug it up three times! It survived. This past winter, the bird feeder fell on it. It was a bitter cold winter with not a lot of snow on that portion of the bed. But, here it is - now two sprouts. It makes me happy and hopeful to look at it every morning. And I am hopeful that my fencing gets done this year, that the duck eggs hatch, that my friends will be healthy and happy for all of their lives, that I will find my soul mate wherever he is.

The weather was perfect, the sheep were not too badly behaved, the shearer was awesome, and it turned into a party. I couldn't have asked for anything more.This year I was lucky enough to get on Kevin Ford's shearing list. He is the pre-eminent blade shearer in our area and one of the best anywhere, IMHO. My neighbor down the road, Schuyler, had used him and invited me to add my sheep to his list. Thanks to him, I realized that I still have a lot to learn about my Icelandics. (Surprise!) They typically are shorn twice a year, as the winter fleece tends to felt. Yes, indeed. And, they don't jacket well, as ALL their fleece then tends to felt. Yes, indeed.One of the benefits of blade shearing is that a nice short layer of wool is left on the sheep - this is very handy when the temperatures go down into the 20s at night. And I was very happy to find that three of the four ewes showed no signs of internal parasites - only Juno needed a drench (and a shot of Vitamin E/Selenium, just in case). This was also an excuse to invite all my farming women friends (and a husband and son) to lunch afterward. There is so much good, vital energy amongst these women. The conversations are animated and interesting, information is passed around (as are recipes). At one point during the afternoon, I just stood and looked at them all and felt amazingly lucky. Kevin with Flora, my 9 yo ewe. She is the sweetest sheep. I kept her twin ewe lambs from last year, Juno and Freyda. Both of them were shorn for the first time. After I assured Kevin that both lambs were just like their sweet-tempered, calm mother, they started bouncing around like crazy things. He has a great 'way' about him with the sheep - he moves quietly and steadily and reassures them from time to time. It was fascinating to watch him in action.Since I do not have the hang of the photo layout yet, I will post the \"after\" shots in a separate post! Just call me technically challenged."},

I had bought the two as a breeding pair, but soon had to change Georgia to Georgie. When spring arrives, everything/one gets stirred up and there is no room for brotherhood. Someone always has to be on top.Unfortunately, in their case, they need to be on top of everything with feathers.  This does not work out well when the weight ration is 15:1.  I just happened to walk outside as Georgie tried to mount one of my small hens.  All I could see were a few golden feathers and a gasping, squeaky noise.  More drama!  They are now on the fast-list to freezer camp.  One of the many things I have learned in the four+ years of doing this homesteading thing, is that not everything works out the way you planned.  That is especially true with livestock.  I went through my quail stage - determined to make my fortune raising them from eggs and selling both eggs and processed birds.  They were a snap to incubate and grew amazingly fast.  But they were LOUD.  (Are we seeing a trend here?)  The male quail will let out an alarmingly loud pealing cry at any time of the day or night.  Preferably around 2 a.m.  And the way I have my livestock operation set up (using the term very loosely), that put them almost right outside of my bedroom window.

There's a lot of information out there -- and as many opinions -- and I did a lot of research. A Livestock Guard Dog (LGD) was out since it would cause problems with my own dogs and would mean providing more comprehensive shelter. Then there were guard donkeys. I loved the idea of a guard donkey -- one step closer to horse ownership. My dairy farmer neighbor happened to have two donkeys so I started hanging around making helpful conversation like, \"I bet it's hard to take care of all those cows AND donkeys.\" I am so subtle. I really didn't have to convince him all that much and we were just on the brink of making the deal, when both donkeys brayed. I doubt if I could convey the eardrum-splitting volume of two donkeys braying in close proximity. I immediately was set upon by visions of my nearest neighbors calling 911, the ASPCA, the State Police, their cousin Vinny. And I was also aware that my buccolic, peaceful little spread would be so no longer. I backed out of the barn quickly under some pathetic cover like, \"um, I have to go feed the chickens - I hear them calling me.\" My neighbor is very understanding. Long story not short enough, I ended up with a guard llama. He came from a llama breeder south of me at a bargain price - he was intact, bucktoothed, had an embarrassing name, and was small for his breed. He kept getting pushed aside from the grain by the bigger boys. When I first brought him home, his only interest in the sheep were running over them to get to the grain first. I wasn't impressed. Just as I was seriously considering turning him in for a REAL guard llama, the ewes lambed. Hoosier went from aloof to Uncle Hoosie. He sniffed the lambs thoroughly and went into guard llama mode and never looked back. He's a gem. (Kudos to Connie for a great picture!)"},

No matter how many times I have put her back in with her fellow ducks, she manages to escape back to the coop and her soul sisters. I actually think she is avoiding the drake, but I may be wrong. Dottie is a Muscovy with a penchant for white bread. I trained her to eat out of my hand - thinking I was so clever. Then I realized that Dottie had realized that she wouldn't have to beat off the chickens if I gave it directly to her. They're too giddy to focus on direct feeding techniques. I am humbled on a daily basis.If you look very carefully at this photograph, you will see a little grey head to the left of the red water dish.  This is Violet.  She is a Blue Andalusian - if I remember correctly.  I haven't seen more of her than her little head in over three weeks.  One morning, three weeks ago, as I was bending over to unlatch the door to the coop and let loose the hoard, I noticed a LARGE pile of grey feathers on the ground near the shed.  Dang!  I figured the hawk had claimed a pigeon.  Then I recognized the feathers.  A quick check of the little coop (nursery to all small poultry) came up with one short of the head-count.  I didn't see any blood or gore, so I figured she had been carried off.  As I leaned over to pick up the feathers, I noticed a grey-feathered form squeezed under the shed - she was alive and terrified.  I suspected Bernie - the closet hunter.  Violet must have gotten out of the nursery and I unwittingly let the dogs out.  Bernie gets a mouthful of feathers, and Violet moves under the shed.  Since the ground is frozen, I cannot dig her out and she has shown no signs of venturing out on her own.  It's fine for now, but the trouble is, there's a 'backdoor' on the wild side of the shed - and no end of chicken-eating varmints who know it's there.  I'm trying to convince myself that it is worth it to cut a hole in the shed floor and roust her out.  So far, it's on the bottom of my six-page to-do list.  Stay tuned."},

I had originally built the hoop house to the left as a sort of chicken tractor for my first batch of meat birds. After a weasel pointed out it's failings as that type of structure, I was able to move it to the sheep pasture for their shelter. It has framing, strength and I took my time building it. The 'structure' to the right was thrown up quickly because I had diddled around and left myself no time before the llama arrived. Basically, I pounded four t-posts into the ground, bent a couple of cattle panels between them into a hoop, and bungeed a series of tarps over the lot. I was very proud of my ingenuity. I had every intention of reinforcing it. Then I diddled for a year. Then we got two feet of very heavy snow. Lesson learned? We'll see.  It's propped up with a 2x2 for now -- and I hope to be able to salvage most of it to reuse in another area.  This time I WILL take the time to put it on a frame.  Or will I? Cookie will be 10 in a couple of days. He is the size and coloring of a Holstein, but as sweet as can be. He started his life living with a foster dog who licked his head into cowlicks every morning and he's never recovered from the sheer bliss of it. Unfortunately, neither Bernie or Scrappy have the least bit of interest in picking up the habit .He was inseparable from Woody, a very sweet Holstein-like cat who was white where Cookie was black. Woody passed away from cancer last year and Cookie still misses him, as do we all. With the exception of Tippet. Tippet - a mere parakeet in comparison with Cookie - does not like: cats or dogs. She loves me and will do any of the following to get my attention: butt me with her head, bite me, paw me. And all of this is done incessantly, unendingly, with an obsessive might that either means she is diabolical or has the mental capacity of a morel. I suspect both.We will soon be adding a Tuxedo kitten named \"Thumper\". I have told no one this - including Cookie and Tippet - because my family and friends already suspect that I have \"issues\". I have found it prudent not to give them any ammunition so I just drop in a turkey, llama, kitten, quail and wait for the reaction. There is a benefit from living with this menagerie - it keeps them off of the subject of why I am not in a meaningful relationship. Amen.(thank you, Frances, for the amazing pics!)This is Bernie. While she also came with this name, the only reason I didn't change it is that it took me so long to gain her trust -- it would have been cruel to throw in a curve ball. She is a complex, wild and wonderful thing - both shy and rapturous, timid and wolf-like. It all depends on the situation. Inside, she bows to Scrappy, both cats and me. Outside, she leaps, digs, wags, and trots. She lunges after cars, trucks, squirrels, coyotes, birds, leaves, grass - you get the picture. But put one teeny tiny bit of thunder in her way, and it's u-turn to home and under the bed until it's clear. That also goes for planes, guns, sudden moves, hard breathing, a fire in the fireplace -- the list goes on. She's had a hard life, this girl, and, 'tho she has it cushy now, old terrors lie just beneath the surface. Bernie is of an undetermined 'older' age, but I have lumped her birthday in with Scrappy's.

As the song goes, \"Just one look...was all it took.\" Scrappy came with his name (although I do call him \"Sparky\" in weak moments) and, as he's 10 this year, it didn't seem fair to make him learn a new name. He is quite a character - we call him Burt Lahr in dog's clothing. He is also very jealous so, if I get a hug, I have to keep one hairy eyeball on him - he's liable to sneak up on the hugger and nip pants. Although it seem like Scrappy has been with me since the beginning of time, he's been here less than a year."},
{"title": "Neighbors - The Good.  The Bad.  The Ugly.", "date": "Tuesday, March 2, 2010", "text": "One thing I learned early-on, is that neighbors - and your relationship with same - is very, very important when you are homesteading on your own with limited resources and abilities and a LOOOOONG learning curve. I have had wonderful luck in being situated near a small dairy farm that is worked by a generous and kind family. I trade baked goods, eggs and nail-trimming services (for a small but feisty dog) for wonderful raw milk. And they also plow my driveway when it snows. And they also 'gave' me a beautiful Jersey heifer calf who was born the day before my birthday. I love them.So, that is the good. I also have the bad. Two neighbors in particular who live down my road and apparently see themselves as the land czars of the road. Between the two of them, they own about 90% of the land. When I bought my house, I was not made aware of a new gravel pit that had opened down the road. There is no sign, no indication that it is there - except in the spring, summer, fall and most of the winter when tens of heavy dump trucks roar past my house, covering lawn, trees, house in a tsunami of dust. This particular 'neighbor' has bought up a lovely farm with the most beautiful rolling fields I have ever seen. He is slowly transforming it into an extension of his gravel pit. They are the ugly. Very ugly. In the winter, he and his cronies tear-ass over the fields (and our roads, illegally) in their snowmobiles. At the risk of offending snowmobilers, it is just another so-called sport for lazy people. I cannot see the thrill of plopping my ass on a machine that tears up the land, makes horrendous noise and provides no exercise whatsoever. I suppose the labor of trying to stay on the thing while you've got a snootful of booze could be challenging.Back to the good. I also have a neighbor/friend who will charge to my aid no matter what time I call. She always brings knitting, has a wonderful wit and sense of humor and is no-end talented. It also helps that she is willing to help me rassle my sheep and give them whatever injections or drenches they may need. I couldn't live without her. And her husband willingly gives up portions of his weekend to help me haul large quantities of hay and put up fencing.I have another friend who is very handy and retired. He recently noticed my origami laundry tree (thanks to the snow/wind of last week) and casually mentioned that he would be happy to stop by, pick it up, take it home and fix it. Huzzah! He is a gem and good dinner company.I am lucky. My good neighbors vastly outweigh my bad and ugly neighbors. As for the coming of dump truck season, I have ordered three willow bushes that are guaranteed to grow massively in short order. They will have their work cut out for them."},
{"title": "Hello my Life.", "date": "Monday, March 1, 2010", "text": "In the beginning there was a middle-aged, first-time homeowner, four acres of rocks, weeds and hidden caches of old, burned garbage. Four years later, there are rocks, slightly fewer weeds, and - I'm sure - still-earthed burned garbage waiting to see the light of day. There are also two hoop houses, housing four Icelandic sheep and a llama; assorted poultry buildings housing one bourbon red Tom named Georgie; four ducks; and way too many chickens. The little green house contains Bernie and Scrappy, my faithful, funny rescue dogs; and Tippet and Cookie, mousers extraordinaire. (You were the best, Woody, r.i.p.) And me, a 50-something homesteading late-bloomer.In honor of the upcoming fourth anniversary of my venture into homesteading (and at the urging of family and friends who think my life is hilarious) I agreed to start writing about the strange and sometimes wonderful things that happen to me on a daily basis.Let me start out by saying that starting on a path to self-sufficiency at my age was probably not the wisest move I ever made. But, then again, it couldn't be helped. I HAD to do it. Four years ago, with the keys to my first house in my hand, there was nothing I couldn't accomplish if I put my mind to it. I must have been totally delusional. While visions of painted white fences on buccoli rolling fields danced in my head, the realities are more like the Beverly Hillbillies meet Apalachia on mind-altering drugs. Still, I persevere because I love walking out in the morning to hear the blatting of the sheep and assorted other sounds. Juno, last spring's lamb, follows me like a dog and likes to have her ears scratched. Birds sing in the many trees surrounding me, the sun comes up over the mountains behind me. Hoosier, the llama, searches my pockets for graham crackers. These sights and sounds help me make it through the end -to-end blizzards that dump enough heavy snow to collapse my hoop house, warp my laundry tree, drag down my fences. Well, to be honest, I completely forget all the lovely moments when that happens.The next installment will introduce you to all of my furred and feathered charges, and I will catch you up on the 'high' points of the last four years - while launching into the daily maelstrom that is my present. Cheers!"}
