{"title": "Boring, Oregon", "date": "Friday, December 1, 2023", "text": "As a resident of Normal, Illinois, I was delighted to pass through Boring, Oregon on a recent trip to Portland for the birth of my grandbaby! I'm happy to report that Boring* was not boring at all, but a charming town, as was Sandy, Oregon, both on the way to Trillium Lake, pictured here with Lola and her mother (my daughter!) in the foreground and Mount Hood in the background, near sunset, looking golden. It was still white on our way up.*It's named for a fellow, not a state of mind. And Normal, Illinois is mentioned in the Boring, Oregon Wikipedia article!And here is Lola as a polar bear. Shortly after this, she had a diaper change and nursed in a warm car. Reality. Golden background or no. It was an absolute delight to be with her. I was present at her birth, a long labor. I held her for hours many nights, so her parents could get some sleep. I did what my mother did for me, with both my children. I was so grateful to be able to do so! And it makes me cry to say so.I miss my mommy. People, I have to tell you I would stare at the photo of her I sent for her obituary and posted on my Facebook page, and say, \"My mommy!\" and cry every time, as I am crying now. At first, in the thick of it all, labor, delivery, tending the baby, I just kept going. I knew what to do; it was what she would do. Then grief would surprise me with its whack in the heart. My husband tells me this will keep happening. My heart goes out to all of you who have lost someone dear to you. Especially, if she was a good one, your mother. Mine was. I know I am lucky.Upon my return to Normal, I went to work. I did laundry. I paid utility bills. I tried to catch up on various tasks. I visited my father, who is doing OK. I love to get mail. Good old-fashioned snail mail. But, so far, I have been unable to open the many condolence cards that arrived in my absence, were held at the post office, and got delivered in two bunches on my return. I'm sorry! I will open them eventually, and reply to you, as would my mother. I will probably use the box of cards she had saved, that I found in her house as I was clearing it out in September and October so it could be sold. My father closed on the house on November 1. Lola was born November 4. My mother died November 5. It was a lovely circle, and it makes me 1) weep 2) grateful.I'm grateful that my sister could travel to Normal while I was gone, and that she slept beside my mother on the night she died. I'm grateful that my dad could be included in a big, lively, joyful Thanksgiving celebration with my brother-in-law's family! And that we had a lovely celebration of our own, in Portland. I'm grateful that my son is perfecting the traditional orange-pretzel salad, a favorite my mom used to make for holiday meals, and that he will be able to come home for Christmas this year.I'm grateful to be boring! To post relentless pictures of my grandchild! Grateful to be a grandmother. It's what my mother was! Both my kids joined me for a Zoom church remembrance of my mom. Grateful for that! And that my brother could also attend, from California. (We'll have a celebration of life later, in warmer weather. In Normal.) I'm grateful that my mom's sister and her daughter came to town the weekend it all came to a crisis, and saw my mom in her last lucid moments, before she seized and slept.And now this next adventure, navigating grief. I'm starting with evasion, leaving those letters sealed, doing chores, decorating for Christmas, but, as my dad said, I have to \"go through it,\" and we will. Together and on our own. In my case, some poems are coming, to rescue me. Words are suddenly rolling out, not quite randomly."},

Bret turned to look and pointed it out to us, as we prepared to cross the one busy road on our neighborhood walk here in the SE quarter of Portland, OR. Another neighborhood walk is planned for today, a sunny day, timed with the baby's nap after a feeding, as she loves sleeping in the stroller on a jiggly walk. I love being a new grandma. It is helping me continue to accept my mother's death, in part because I am doing the things she did for me, when she came to help with both my babies. I am continuing a motherly tradition, and wearing my Mother Road hat to shield my blue eyes from the sun.Baby Lola's eyes will probably be brown. Both parents have dark brown hair and brown eyes. But maybe not. Green eyes appear in Bret's family, and Lola currently has auburn hair. His grandpa had dark red hair. Wouldn't that be a delight? I had a poem accepted for the Claude Monet issue of Poetry East. It is, of course, a mother poem, as well as a Monet poem. It's titled \"Bridge.\" I was gazing at lots of the \"Bridge Over the Lily Pond\" paintings and anticipating my mother's death. Right now I am simply gathering lines that come to me in my poetry composition notebook, brought along on the trip, along with my daily diary, a dream journal, and a tiny reading journal. I am reading and writing steadily, in snippets between baby holdings and diaper changes.Lola's father is excellent at diaper changes and sleep swaddling. Here he is, and here she is, swaddled with a little white noise machine near her head. My daughter is doing well, healing, nursing, walking, creating new routines. She plans outings, so we have been to a park and a garden where we saw many ducks, a flock of geese that rose from a pond, circled it, and resettled, and a bald eagle in a treetop.Another outing was to Doe Donuts, which I highly recommend if you go to Portland, a town well known for donuts as well as Powell's Books! We all loved the whipped-cream topped donuts called Portland Fog! Their logo has a sweet doe, but I don't have a picture of that. And while Doe Donuts doesn't love day-old donuts, I do. Another favorite was cranberry lime."},
{"title": "Peacock on the Roof", "date": "Tuesday, November 7, 2023", "text": "It's a beautiful day in Portland, Oregon, sunny, with bright fall leaves blowing down and gray clouds massing in the distance, after days of rain, and that's a peacock on the roof. I came here to help my daughter have a baby, and that has indeed happened. A beautiful baby named Lola, 8 lbs, 12 oz, 22 inches long. So far, she likes to sleep in the daytime and keep her parents awake from 10 p.m. to 2 a.m., like lots of babies who sleep while the mother is active by day and kick around nocturnally. I am happy to hold this baby and stare at her. The activity that rocked her to sleep in the womb included a daily neighborhood walk that I got to do with the family a couple times before the birth, and that's where the peacocks come in. Just as there is a flock of wild turkeys back at home, or trail turkeys, since they walk the Constitution Trail as well as the neighborhoods, here there is a flock of wild peacocks. Or you might say a pride of peacocks, a muster of peacocks, or an ostentation of peacocks. Although these local peacocks are quite modest and unostentatious. Shortly after getting this picture through my son's window, I got to witness this one fly gently down to earth.Then time stood still, as they say, suspended itself, and we had days of labor in a hospital room. The baby was born, and then my mother died, as if she had been waiting for the baby to come into the world before she went out of it."},

Now my sister is coming, and her husband, with a truck! Two Men and a Truck came, such hardworking guys! Recycling Furniture for Families. Habitat for Humanity, their Home ReStore. Friends baking cookies for an event Saturday afternoon. Friends helping with moral support and labor. I am so grateful. And the nasturtiums are still blooming!Meanwhile, I am still working, still editing. The poetry has mostly been set aside, but today I was revising two poems, and that felt good. My printer broke, and ironically these would go to a snail mail publication. But I have let so many deadlines pass during this necessary time of other work. A poem came out, in Border Crossing. Other poems were (kindly) rejected. Again, gratitude.Other people's fathers are failing, dying. Other people's mothers. The trouble continues in Ukraine, in Gaza, elsewhere. So much suffering continues. Yet my time has felt suspended, even as tasks went on. These nasturtiums are hiding under an umbrella of leaves. So am I, maybe.But I led a board meeting, I met with a banker, I did an all-day work training on mental health in older adults. Met with co-workers to plan a Death Cafe. I am feeding the neighbor's cat. Packing to go help my daughter have a baby! It all somehow gets done.Meanwhile, the burning bush went red!"}

{"title": "My Nasturtiums", "date": "Sunday, October 1, 2023", "text": "Sometime in the middle of the summer I planted nasturtiums and marigolds from seed along the fence, and they have been gloriously blooming all September, and now it's October! There's a tiny nasturtium patch blooming under the Little Free Library for Iris Harley, who would be 5 now--next year to be joined by white anemone. Almost everything in my yard is native or perennial or I harvest seeds from one year to plant the next. Chicory and Queen Anne's Lace come on their own.My friend Ken Kashian, photographer, asked if he could have some leaves and blooms for a photo project. Yes, come over! He did. These are his photos. This one, which reminds me of a ballet dancer, is my new Facebook profile picture. The delicacy and light in these photographs are helping me, sustaining me. September has been a hard month, emotionally. My mother was in the hospital for a week and has now been released to memory care, where we are gradually adorning her room with comfortable, familiar, and beautiful things. Visits are brief. She's doing OK.My brother and his wife have been here, visiting family and helping me clear out the family home. Heavy lifting! Husband helping, too, and yesterday he transported about a dozen boxes to Books to Benefit. Books, paintings, clothing, kitchen things, pretty things, music, and eventually furniture will all be finding new homes. (Let me know if you need anything! We might have it!) Dusty sorting, nostalgia, family photos...My father is coping, grieving, raging, and, perhaps, relaxing a bit. Maybe some stress will fall off. Maybe he can make new social patterns. The university archivist took 26 boxes of his papers--teaching materials, publications, plays, drafts, authored books... There is so much more left to sort in the house. I am exhausted in all the ways. But imagine him--his whole life gone, the marriage torn, two frail loving people, near but apart.Friends, as well as family, are helping in supportive and practical ways. I am so grateful. And a special joy this weekend was our houseguest, fiber artist Pat Kroth, here for the Sugar Creek Arts Festival--and, a nice surprise for her, a double award winner! One of the awards is for art that uses recycled materials. I am happy to say that some of her future art will include a watercolor silk dress from my mom, and some of her skinny jeans!For the first time in a long time, I reached for my poetry drafting notebook, to capture two lines that came to me suddenly: \"Remember the knife / and the tiny spoon.\" These are a cake knife and a salt spoon, brought home from the farmhouse--the spoon because it is so tiny and charming, the knife in case I bake a cake. But who knows what they will be in the eventual poem? It is assembling itself in fragments. \"Will there be a piano?\" I don't know where it will go next."},
{"title": "Mother Tree", "date": "Saturday, September 16, 2023", "text": "I guess this is what I am doing in the way of poetry lately: a Mother Tree. Visual, 3D poetry--a small branch anchored in a vase with glass pebbles, hung with ornaments from her life: earrings, baby bracelets, a nostalgic love pin nestling in the tree as if K-I-S-S-I-N-G. There are two tiny skulls to represent her parents, who lived with my parents for a time in their old age. So did my dad's grandfather, at one point. My folks were very generous people, also taking in a high school student, whose parents moved his senior year, and a young man from Mali. They are living now in a retirement community, in independent living but with lots of home health care, and I am slowly but surely clearing out the family home while it is for sale. Lots of laundering, donating, recycling, redistributing, and rearranging. I feel like my mom! There is a silver chain with an apple on it, from when my mom retired from teaching, and a silver gavel, probably from her years with the local teachers' union. My brother's blue baby bracelet hangs near the latter.My sister and I have pink baby bracelets, and near them I have hung one of my own earrings, a favorite, the mate lost, pink stones, one in the shape of a heart.There is a found earring (like a found poem!), a sort of mask, chosen for the Mother Tree because of her work in the theatre. Her mother's hospital bracelet, or her own (?), hangs around the vase itself.I loved making my Mother Tree. I did it instead of church last Sunday morning. It was a way to relieve stress, honor my mom, and felt spiritual, to be sure. It was a way to rest, after all the cleaning. It was a way to take things from tiny boxes and let them live again. I thank Connie Shannon for the inspiration. She made a \"tiny beautiful things\" tree this past spring when Heartland Theatre was doing the play Tiny Beautiful Things, based on the Cheryl Strayed book. It became part of a library display for the production, and then library workers loved it so much it became part of ongoing displays all through the summer!Here is my Mother Tree where it lives now, on a stand at the top of the stairs, with a stack of books, under a painting by my husband. He knocked it over this morning, coming out of the bedroom, but I was able to restore it (and slightly reposition it, to avoid this in the future!). It's fragile but able to be rehung or added to, as needed. There might be more mateless earrings to come...."},
{"title": "Furious Cooking", "date": "Sunday, August 27, 2023", "text": "If I were doing the Sealey Challenge this year, I would embark on a re-reading of the Maureen Seaton books in my possession, having just learned of her death. I met her in Chicago and took a seminar with her, and she was an inspiration. She encouraged me to send some prose poems to Quarter After Eight, where they were taken. It became a favorite journal of mine, full of the challenging and unexpected. I would probably start with Furious Cooking.Sadly, I am not doing the Sealey Challenge this year--voraciously reading a book of poems a day in August--because daily life has gotten a bit too complicated by caregiving, though resting with poetry might have helped. The heat wave did not. Now I think of throwing my ivy comforter on this wooden glider, putting the stack of Seaton books beside me, and at least leafing through, pausing here and there to concentrate on a poem. But the afternoon is spoken for.Yesterday morning, I tabled for the local Democrats at the annual Sweet Corn Circus, having many great conversations with people who stopped by, and giving away a lot of children's sunglasses, pencils, pens that are also styluses, and buttons. We heard the whistle that meant the sweet corn was cooked and ready for eating. Gammi Phi Circus performers stopped by our booth for candy. On my way out, I saw their performance space, with young kids rolling around their pool inside giant blow-up plastic balls. It was a delight. Then I took my mom to Urgent Care, as when I went to change her wound dressing, I found the wound was infected. Sigh....That's kind of how each day goes now.Here, at least, are some random poem titles from Furious Cooking, to give you a sense of, well, everything. And its pertinence:\"After Sinead O'Connor Appears on Saturday Night Live, the Pope\"\"A Constant Dissolution of Molecules\"\"Self-Portrait with Disasters\"\"The Man Who Killed Himself to Avoid August\""},

She has freckles and brown hair. Here she is with a book hedgehog in the background, wearing fairly sensible yellow heels (sturdy squarish, not spike heels; and they are also square-toed. The kind I myself might wear, if there were a yellow opportunity!) Yes, we saw the Barbie movie last night. Went with my sister, visiting from Nebraska, and my husband, who enjoyed it a lot. It was not what he was expecting. Thank you, Greta Gerwig!It turns out my sister had no Barbies of her own, just played happily with my handmedowns. I sort of remember being asked about that and saying yes, of course, and of giving her Skipper outright at some point. Where is Skipper? My daughter had Barbies of various sorts; some were sold, some may still be in the house, but she/we did a lot of responsible cleaning out, so maybe not.My sister was here to help with some responsible cleaning out of the family home, and progress was made, and good things happened this week--medically and with home health care, etc. Joy and relief! But care and stress continue. All shall be well. And today shall be a Slattern Day...."},
{"title": "Where's Home Now?", "date": "Sunday, July 30, 2023", "text": "My family home went up for sale this weekend. So if you live in the Midwest, or want to, there it is. (It's in corn and soybean land now, but, given global warming, this could be the tropics soon.) I loved growing up there. So many good memories, including my daughter's wedding in the back yard; so many holidays; so much love, so much change. I'm simultaneously teary-eyed with love and nostalgia and realistic. It's the right time. My parents are safe and sound in a retirement community, and it's time to let someone else love this dear, dear place. (It will haunt my dreams.)I sat at two booths yesterday at our local Pridefest, put off for a month but hugely popular and well-attended this beautiful, beautiful Saturday and night. The dangerous heat had lifted, there was a breeze, there were rainbow capes and braids and a rainbow tutu (on our new lesbian pastor) and plenty of temporary tattoos. I saw a snippet of the glorious drag performance in front of the Bistro, and then left, pooped. Today, I met a new caregiver for my mom, and she had attended Pridefest as well, an excellent omen.When I first arrived, my parents were not in their apartment. I looked in the usual places--and I had brought fresh-baked cookies, left by the door as I searched--but we kept missing each other. Finally, I found them and we took the elevator and headed down the hall, my parents walking at their different paces, using the convenient handrail, as I walked at my mother's side.\"Where's home now?\" she asked. It was not in regard to the sale of the family home. It was a polite question she asks people she knows she knows...but can't quite recall. It's the first time this has happened to me, but the timing is so perfect, I can let it be.Later, she knew me. (I think.) I changed the dressing on the wound on her leg, almost healed! We taught our favorite card game to the new caregiver--who loves theatre (yay!), who played volleyball in high school (yay!), who was at Pridefest yesterday (yay!). So much to be grateful for, as my heart keeps gently breaking."},

Busy, stressful times continue, but with beauty, joy, and moments of sweet downtime, plus, alas, dangerous heat. But the heat has lifted, and I am soon to volunteer at two tables for our annual downtown Pridefest, itself delayed by a full month but now fully supported by the city. I've got my Pride hat, my Pride flags, and two shirts--one for each organization, plus a water bottle, travel tissue, a cell phone for a ride home, and a Walt Whitman tote bag. I feel strangely well prepared! I hope I am coherent, as I had a little anesthesia yesterday. Nasturtiums I planted from seed, and the above marigold, are blooming! There was welcome rain and, sadly, some unwelcome damage from recent storms. Let's hope we all repair."},
{"title": "Everything's Coming up Barbie", "date": "Friday, July 21, 2023", "text": "The new Barbie movie looks like so much fun. Weird fun. Here are some other weird things lately. I was driving home and got to the railroad tracks with the red lights flashing. It was a short wait, no train went by, etc., but when I looked in my side view mirror the driver of the car two cars behind me was down on the road doing push-ups! On the road. Doing push-ups! Here is my classic Barbie, a brunette from the 1960s. I also have Midge. And this fabulous red velvet coat. Fond memories, lots of wear and tear on the wardrobe and the case. I don't think I will become a millionaire from this vintage Barbie. I do love her clothes. There's also a red one-piece swimsuit.Walking to work today, I was not, thank goodness, killed, but a car turned left very close to me. I could feel and hear the whoosh. Grateful he didn't run over my foot. I was crossing in the crosswalk with the walk light, and he was turning left facing east into the blinding sun. He might not even have seen me. It made me a little cranky, making it a Cranky Doodle Day in the blog, but I have fun stuff happening later: wine, dinner on the grounds of Ewing Castle, and The Tempest at the Illinois Shakespeare Festival! I have already seen Comedy of Errors and The Book of Will. Lucky me! And in the good news department, a short play of mine, \"Shakespeare's Ladies at Tea (or I Thought You'd Never Asp)\" will be performed in August in New York City by First Flight Theatre Company in Under St. Mark's as part of the Little Shakespeare Festival. It is a little play! a tragicomedy! And was great fun to do many years ago in Chicago, so I hope it is great fun again!"},
{"title": "Red Hibiscus, Fog, Sitcoms, Shock, Badassery", "date": "Thursday, July 20, 2023", "text": "Dear blog readers, I haven't forgotten you--I just write my blog to you in my head while swimming, early in the morning. Twice now, I've gone swimming in the fog--once a drifty, blowy fog and today (was it today?) a stationary fog that soon disappeared. Since lap swimming is repetitive, I do lose track of days. It also becomes meditative. As the summer has progressed, that easy breathing thing has happened. I feel like I could swim forever. But this is sometimes followed by my nose having to remind itself not to breathe water, my body thinking it lives here now. The other meditative thing I did lately was walking the trail through two butterfly areas--the butterfly refuge, a wild native prairie with monarch-loving plants and mown paths, and a planted butterfly garden maintained behind the cancer center. The latter has a labyrinth, where I did a walking meditation.But first a shocking thing happened: a man pushing a stroller with two children in it came up the path saying to them,\"Remember when I said I would slap you to the ground? I was just joking, but those people believed me.\" He then veered off the path to take a shortcut over a grassy hill to some apartments. (I don't think he was joking.) Then another shocking thing: on the trail a couple was talking about panic, saying, \"You can panic all you want if you keep saying you're right.\" And then, \"They'll break into our homes and shoot us in our beds.\" What is going on? It was just a beautiful, peaceful day otherwise. It seems like America is scared and angry, and violent. On a Saturday, with kids.But today is Thursday, or Thor's Day in the blog. I can conquer this with peace and poetry. And comedy. And sorrow. I have two poems in the current issue of Redactions, the Sitcom Issue, because my life is a sitcom (Mad About You) and a dark, quirky comedy (Everybody Loves Raymond if it was rebooted as a future White Lotus). To further mess things up, both of these began with biblical prompts, during Lent.My husband had a birthday this week, and we celebrated by going to a poetry reading (he liked it!) and taking the poet and her husband out to dinner. The poet was Lynne Jensen Lampe--she came to our little public library from Columbia, Missouri--reading new poems, and poems from her new book, Talk Smack to a Hurricane. We have a robust reading series of local and regional poets, and, especially since our virtual programming during Covid, many far-flung poets, some, like Lynne, who still show up in person, and some who remain virtual. I'm delighted that Chicago poet Yvonne Zipter will come down in October. Really, it's a fantastic series that doesn't get much local media attention, but I am reading Year of Yes by Shonda Rhimes, thanks to my new pastor, and so may try to attempt some marketing badassery soon. Shonda makes me laugh out loud. Thank you, I needed that!"},
{"title": "Soon", "date": "Sunday, July 9, 2023", "text": "Soon I'll move back outdoors on this lovely Sunday afternoon. The garden is wild and leaping now, since the generous rains. I planted nasturtium late, by seed, and it is leafy with at least one tiny bloom budding. I hope there will be more. Prairie Blue Eyes continue to open, lasting for a day. My Rose of Sharon is always late compared to others in the neighborhood, but I see buds there, too. My parents came to church, a nice surprise, and I also went to visit them afterwards, having lunch and a walk together, with more flower gazing. I did the daily wound dressing for my mom, seeing good progress. Soon, I hope, she will be fully healed.My father has trouble breathing, with low energy as a result. Soon he will need oxygen more than overnight, but, as always, it will be hard to convince him of that. He wants, instead, to get better. So we do what we can with what we have. Yesterday, we all played a nice round of rummy golf (a card game, though he plays actual golf some Mondays!)Usually, I find out what I am doing by staring at my daily calendar. It reminds me of when the kids were growing up--so many things to keep track of: practices, school health exams, softball, volleyball, summer baseball... More tasks await in emails. I do them all as they come, as there is only this moment to do them in. Just now, I put on gloves and wiggled two wheels on the little blue car, helping my husband with a car repair. That wasn't on the physical calendar, just on the calendar of our brains. The car needs new transmission fluid, and if that doesn't work, its time has come. (It's a 1991 Ford.) I have been checking out the Chilton Repair Manual for several years now, my circulation stats probably keeping it in the library!My dreams, too, are task or trouble related. They might possibly lead to new poems...if I put that on the calendar."},

And we've been having drought and wildfire smoke, so it's been looking like August out there for a while, with chicory fully in bloom and Queen Anne's Lace ready to pop. Now, thunderstorms bring needed rain. The purple cone flower is open, the orange day lily, the sort of lavender-mauve Prairie Blue Eye, nothing \"blue\" about it. I've been swimming, except for 2 days this week, when weather & circumstances prevented it, and enjoying the ducks at the pool and some neighborhood ducks on my walks to work.I have a poem in Image, a beautiful journal. The print copies arrived this week, and the online version comes out July 6. I am thrilled and enjoying the issue, full of variety, plus Art, Faith, Mystery.The books I am reading continue to have a music connection, as noted in a previous blog entry, and my sister was here for a few days, so we sang at the piano--\"Joanne\" and showtunes, a little concert for my mom between medical appointments. I loved learning more about Bill Harrison in Making the Low Notes, a memoir by a bass player and therapist I had met in Chicago! And even Cambridge, a novel (autobiographical?!) by Susanna Kaysen (of Girl, Interrupted) had music in it--a mother who plays the piano, a teacher, Vishwa, who teaches the young Susanna to listen--as did Dear Diary, by Lesley Arfin, with punk and rave concerts in it. My life is a tangle of intersecting strands. Even last night, the interstitial music was gorgeous in The Book of Will, by Lauren Gunderson, in a wonderful production directed by Lori Adams, its opening night* at the Illinois Shakespeare Festival. The weather cooperated in letting us see it under the stars (clouds), including a huge wind that blew in after the dramatic death of Burbage. Spoiler alert. Burbage dies, Shakespeare is already dead, somehow his plays get published! And knowing all this before we go in, the play is still full of suspense and a cliffhanger!*I was also lucky enough to attend opening night of Comedy of Errors with my sister (see Open Water Swim). I can't right now untangle my life, but I am enjoying the very mess of it, the love, the moments of respite and card playing, and even the tenderness of wound care as my mother's skin grows back on her leg. Today there may be dancing at church. There will certainly be a potluck. And that makes it another Random Coinciday in the blog.****Oh! And to add to the coincidii, a little play of mine called Shakespeare's Ladies at Tea (a gathering of Shakespeare's women uttering their own real lines in a new context) will be performed in New York in August!

{"title": "Open Water Swim", "date": "Sunday, June 25, 2023", "text": "It was a perfect Saturday morning for the open water swim competition this weekend in Evergreen Lake at Comlara Park. I was not swimming! I was there to support my brother-in-law, Tim, and Rob from Early Bird Lap Swim (weekdays mornings at Fairview Pool, where I do swim!), and all the fabulous swimmers of all ages, local and from afar! Hot, so we standers on shore kept seeking the shade, and I got a weensy bit of sunburn despite my sunscreen (which worked perfectly where I had smeared it correctly). Breezy.It was also a perfect night for the opening of the Illinois Shakespeare Festival! I got to see Comedy of Errors with my sister, and we sat in the castle courtyard afterwards, chatting with each other and with actors, directors, and other theatregoers, as the breeze continued. As we chatted with Karen and Eva, who played sisters Adriana and Luciana, I got to tell Eva that I had played Luciana years and years ago in the same festival! It was a wonderful moment of time doing its weird expansive, eternal, here-and-now thing.Boy, do we need rain. I'm glad it didn't rain yesterday morning (last year's open water swim was canceled due to a downpour, also needed during a time of drought), nor at night during the play (I saw those Colorado concert rain-and-hail videos on the news!), but I wished for overnight rain (only a 30% chance here, reduced to 0% by reality). There were severe storms to the west of us, but nothing here.It's lovely to have family in town visiting, and they got to see the final matinee of The Waiting Room--the 10-Minute Play Festival at Heartland Theatre Company! (I had seen it 3 times before, so I stayed home to water my flowers and otherwise be a slattern.) Today my sister, who is writing a play about Abraham and Mary Lincoln, will take her daughter to Springfield to see a new musical about Abraham and Mary Lincoln. And that makes it a Random Coinciday in the blog!"},
{"title": "Acceptance", "date": "Sunday, June 18, 2023", "text": "I had another recent poetry acceptance, this time for a poem about my mother that is also about the time I played Marjorie in the play Marjorie Prime, a few years back. I played an 80-year-old woman, and afterwards 1) everyone mistook me for my mother 2) I cut off my long hair streaked white that I wore in a braid (just like my mother) and 3) people asked what I did with makeup to look 80. Basically, the answer was \"no makeup.\" For those not so familiar with theatre, the stage lights will wash you out, so wearing no makeup did make me look 80! But still. So now it helps me 1) understand my parents and 2) brace myself to be reading Successful Aging, by Daniel J. Levitin! I like it a lot, and I hope I am aging successfully!I found this book, and got it through interlibrary loan, after I read his book This Is Your Brain on Music, which I discussed with the Stranger Than Fiction non-fiction book club. It meets in a wine bar! Our next book, already in progress, is I Live a Life Like Yours, a memoir by Jan Grue, about living with a disability...and just living his own life, which is like...yours, or mine. The Levitin book on aging is delightful in its examples, many of whom are musicians that he met in his other work! Joni Mitchell, Sonny Rollins.Also in progress is another memoir, this one by musician Bill Harrison, a bass player I met in Chicago! Making the Low Notes. I think all these connections make it a Random Coinciday in the blog, as well as a Poetry Someday, not to mention Father's Day. (I'm glad I remembered to make a reservation for dinner tonight for Dad!) I love having a book at hand in any room, or to take in a cloth bag for any waiting room. Two medical appointments coming up this week for my mom. Successful Aging recommends learning new things: I am learning proper wound care and wrapping. I doubt I can learn a new language or a new musical instrument at this point, but I am making new crafts occasionally, and playing the piano a bit more, now that I am tuning it regularly. Coincidence: Levitin says in the Acknowledgements for This Is Your Brain on Music that one of his favorite songs is \"Joanne\" by Michael Nesmith (of The Monkees!). When I read that, I thought, \"I have that sheet music\" and ransacked my piano bench for it. Success! Plus a bit of stumbling around on the keyboard. But it was fun to find some of the elements of music that Levitin describes and admires immediately evident in a song he likes!"},

Meanwhile, the ground was parched and the creek has twice gone dry. Until today! Sprinkle, then steady light rain, episodic, but enough to make all the plants stand up happy and straight, with some of them appearing to grow an inch in a day. The first day lilies have opened, making it seem to be true summer! Swimming started this week--oh, how wonderful! That, too, makes summer seem here to stay...though it doesn't stay, and already I am aware how swiftly it will go by. I lap swim early, wash the chlorine out of my hair, and walk to work. Sometimes at work, during our 15-minute breaks, we take walks around town. Friday, we walked to the university library and saw a ceramics display, 100 pieces based on poems. I love my life.In it, this lucky life, I am balancing my sorrow. And some ongoing stress. I am grateful I can do so. And glad that these clematis blooms opened on the fence, despite the weeks of drought. Some vines did not even produce buds. But seeds I planted at the re-mounted little free library did come up. More to be glad of and grateful for!Here is a link to Milner Library's ceramic exhibit!"},

And I actually sent off that submission to The New Yorker. Wish me luck. In the meantime, I got a check in the mail--very rare!--for poems soon to come out in December Magazine, and I proofed a poem soon to come out in Image. From a lot of nothing, to a lot of something!And tonight I'm coming up on the third book group in the week of three. Two were/are in friends' homes, so lovely, and one was in the wine bar. Excellent. I had two glasses of wine before the others revealed they were, for various reasons, drinking non-alcoholic beer. I believe I remained coherent. The next book up in that group is This Is Your Brain on Music: The Science of a Human Obsession, by Daniel J. Levitin, so that will be my June challenge book, and I am reading Candy House now, because I am humanly obsessed with fiction.My wild columbine plants are all blooming, and lily of the valley. The iris have begun. My neighbor's lilac makes everything so sweet. I have volunteer honeysuckle in the front where it's hard to get things to grow, so I am leaving it there.

Yes, I may get temporarily attached to Jelly Bellies, but I am permanently attached to books. Fortunately, all of these are library books, and I don't have to try to fit them into my house. (Or my jelly belly.)I got to meet Angela Jackson, Poet Laureate of Illinois, at the library. She mesmerized our audience, and pulled in browsers, including children and their parents. A wonderful afternoon, and big thanks to Candace Summers of the McLean County Museum of History and Illinois Humanities for making the Normal Public Library the venue for this event!My chalkboard poems alternate now between humor and sad nostalgia with images from the natural world, spring blooming all around, and a subtext of the long goodbye. Last night, a woman asked if I was still writing poems and if I had ever been in the New Yorker, which reminded me of a fairly recent personal rejection from the New Yorker asking to see more, and my inaction upon that. Uh oh. \"I want to see you in print,\" the woman said, and I realized again how few people, even those who love me, know that I am very often in print, or in online magazines, and have several chapbooks out there in the world. But I do feel loved and appreciated, especially for the chalkboard poems, which are short and connect to people's lives. I love those people back.I was lonely yesterday evening and texted my daughter to see if it was OK to call. It was. She had seen the May 5 poem on Instagram and understood. Everything constant is slipping away, proving it wasn't...and proving nothing at all...or only that change and the now are what we have, which I know from 1) reading and 2) living, but it is still hard to learn each time I learn it. And glorious. And sweet. We went to hear stories last night in the same arts center where my husband is showing recent paintings. Today I will attend a memorial service there for a journalist who had been slipping away for several years, and is now gone. At another event, my dad will be receiving an award for a lifetime of work in academic theatre. It's all 1) life itself 2) wonderful. Why am I sad, in this lingering, blossoms snowing down kind of way?And next week, starting Sunday, tomorrow, is the week of three book clubs: discussing Remarkably Bright Creatures, by Shelby Van Pelt, the Tolentino book (in a wine bar!), and The Four Winds, by Kristin Hannah, a book about the Dust Bowl, our reading timed perfectly to recent dust storms here in the Midwest, causing car crashes and highway closings just down the road. As in the 1930s, the cause and cure were agricultural practices, which need to better suit the environment and climate realities. A \"cover crop\" between the agribusiness plantings would help.I am very busy, ticking things off my to-do list, and still I find time to read, but not to send another submission to the New Yorker. It's not fear of rejection--I am very used to that--but it might be avoidance of a certain kind of expenditure of energy. I am meeting many deadlines, and even cleared off one of my desktops. Today, even though I proclaim it a Slattern Day in the blog, I might even do some dusting. Or wipe down the chalkboard."},

And wine drinking on my own, when family visited recently for the opening of an art exhibit by my hubby!! It's been a good and busy and hectic month. And it's no longer that month. April. Now, somehow, it is May!! The sun was shining today, the sky was blue, but the chill was still in the air. Tomorrow, perhaps, I can resume walking to work, that is, walking off the jelly beans.I did write a poem a day in April, plus a tiny poem a day on my black chalkboard. Plus some Lenten writing, that was often a poem, during Lent. I guess I am still writing the chalkboard poems on into May, thanks to people wanting them!

Click here to see the fabulous cover art and here to see the current issue, with poems, interview, book review, etc.!

When I took a picture of it with my phone next to the Reveal the Teal bookmark, I learned how to use QR codes. Now I'm reading Manhattan Beach, by Jennifer Egan, with a hand-made bookmark from a friend who understands my relentless book-acquisition habits. Her clever bookmarks for members of our book club show what would be on our t-shirts! Mine says, \"One does not stop buying books beause there is no more shelf space.\" So true. But at least my book buying is affordable (ongoing library used book sale) and often includes book donating at the end! My kids were just here, doing another round of getting rid of stuff (recycling, donating, or tossing games, puzzles, clothes, shoes, memorabilia, past school/art work), and they almost sold a loft bed contraption with bookshelves in it that would have disrupted my world! Fortunately, I have a little time...During their stay, I stopped writing & posting my chalkboard poems. But (by getting up earlier than my kids) I kept writing a poem a day for National Poetry Month. As the poems continue to roll out, the rejections continue to dribble in. Likewise, the weather--a glorious week of warmth and sunshine while they were here, and now a return to chilly, wet weather with dribbling rain. Up so early to take our son to the airport, and now sadness will descend.My nonfiction reading, slow going due to its devastating topic, is Still Life With Bones: Genocide, Forensics, and What Remains, by Alexa Hagerty, automatically renewed via interlibrary loan.

I got to tie a yellow ribbon round a lot of black walnut tree starts, orange ribbons around many hickory starts, and pink ribbons around another variety. Our little ribbons were as colorful as jelly beans! There was also mud and moss.I loved The Humans, by Matt Haig. I read the nose cover and also enjoy the dog cover!

Thanks for reading my blog. I ran into one of my blog readers last night in person at the theatre. What a joy, and I am so touched! He said he has read some books based on my blog accounts, and he also enjoys my chalkboard poems. This just warms my heart! And I needed warming up, as it's been cold and gloomy for a few days, but yesterday the sun came out, and there was a clear sky with stars and a fingernail moon last night!It was a busy, but entertaining, Saturday. In the afternoon, I went to The Lost King, about Richard III, inviting my dad, who has written a play about the king and would be familiar with all the basic research and discrepancies! Delightful movie with Sally Hawkins, followed by a panel discussion of theatre and history experts from the university. And a young woman in the audience who had read the book the movie is based on. I remember the news of finding Richard's bones in a car park! That shouldn't be a spoiler! It was on the news! And it's history! The movie tells another story, too, her story!The balance of cloudy gloom with sunshine carries on in my poetry life, too. A rejection gets balanced by a request to reprint a poem, and going over proofs of some forthcoming poems. And I just keep writing. It's all over the place: chalkboard, computer, composition notebook, notepad for grocery lists, and my shower brain, where dialogue for a script also just spouted out like water or song.

You can see a little video about it, with a fugue as background music, at Ken's website and at the Fugue link above. Part of the joy was the absolute attention of the audience, and part was conversing with them afterwards in a relaxed and cozy way on a rainy night, us warm inside in comfortable chairs donated by other libraries! In fact, Sheryl the director and I realized we had attended the same regional library conference the day before. I guess that makes it a Random Coinciday as well as a Poetry Someday in the blog! Other coincidences: the library director had participated in a theatre in town that I work with, and I went to high school with her husband and his brothers. He farmed up the road from where I lived, and my son and his hometown have the same name! The town and its library are very near the Weston Cemetery Prairie Nature Preserve, where the poems and photos are set. Not everyone in the audience had been there yet, but they'll be visiting soon! I was so honored that people felt reverence for the place, and reverent in our space last night, thanks to the photos and poems, and, I think, the sense of community.Also, I finally read Educated, by Tara Westover, that everyone had told me to read. Wow, were they right. What a story! Right up there with Women Talking, by Miriam Toews, about women overcoming oppression and violence and being uneducated, and finding a way out, a way to live their lives. We hope. I read a good article--where? LA Times?!--about how Women Talking, the film, won't win Best Picture at the Oscars, but that the real \"win\" was being nominated. I think it ends (paraphrasing here), But wouldn't it be nice if we lived in a world where it could win? Yes. And, by the way, can I invite myself to anyone's Oscar party? My tv doesn't get ABC. Well, if not, I guess we could watch the season finale of The Last of Us! But I do love watching the Oscars live."},

But it still has Abraham Lincoln's face on it, as well as my own. I look OK in this picture! I am smiling. And it's all thanks to the DMV women; they took my picture twice, as in the first some hair had fallen into my eye, and the one woman knew there might be trouble if both my blue eyes were not evident. Ironically, 1) I am not wearing glasses in the photo; they don't let you--glare, eye color, etc. even though 2) the license requires me to wear glasses. So, in a way, it's not the Real ME!Chalkboard poems continue. Reading continues. I read a sort of magical realism short novel, The Crane Husband, by Kelly Barnhill because the description reminded me of a poem I had written a couple years back where a woman marries a sandhill crane. This was darker than that, though the poem is also about a cryptid, the Mothman, who might actually be a sandhill crane. I love my life, but it is sometimes hard to explain to people who are not me.

I left work carrying two bags and a  large framed photograph of a gorgeous egret and went up to the 4th floor of the parking garage and on up to the unroofed deck, sun shining, where I had left my car. It was not there. There was this long, unhappy, awkward moment, a little drift into the future, police station, trying to explain, insurance, etc. Then I thought, \"Maybe that was yesterday.\"It is very strange that tomorrow will suddenly be March. Yes, February is a short month. Yes, it can have wildly variable weather. Often there is a lovely thaw right around my birthday, with warm temperatures and sunshine. Sweater weather, even. A feeling of spring!Will March come in like a lion or a lamb? We've already had a wind advisory. (See chalkboard poem above!) I am still writing a poem (or more) a day for Lent. The chalked-in date should help me keep track of day, month, year. But, dude, I lost my car.It was in a ground lot. Back down I went, on the convenient parking-garage elevator, found my car, secured the art, and drove home, stalled for a time by a freight train, pretty common in my little town. We got lots of work done on the tracks and crossing signals, to make way for a bullet train, but it hasn't quite come. Instead, these long freight trains. My excellent plan, were I in transportation power, would be for laborers to build tracks around the town for freight trains and save the in-town tracks and crossings for passenger trains. Jobs for rail workers, peace and convenience for the town, financing from the railroads. The government already paid for the previous work.I got some of my work-at-home done before family chaos ensued. I don't know yet whether that has been resolved, or ever really can be. I'm sad about the falling apart of everything. And joyful and grateful about all the rest--the ongoing love, the sweet memories. The shiny green Mardi Gras/ St. Patrick's Day beads.Meanwhile, alas, people are suffering from so many things. Another earthquake! Ongoing pandemic. Political tension, divisiveness. And those wild, private eruptions, where someone somehow thinks murder is the only answer. It isn't. But you have to have some empathy and imagination to find another. And maybe your upbringing prevented that...for a while. But now, hey, aren't you a grownup? Couldn't you take some responsibility? I don't know. I haven't been driven to murderous impulses, but I did lose my car.Also meanwhile I was reading This Body I Wore, a memoir by poet Diana Goetsch, who previously lived and wrote as Douglas Goetsch. I so admire her transition! I am grateful to have learned so much from her book, and so glad she got to be who she really is! Again, so many of us are suffering, and some of us find a way through to joy, freedom, and light!Meanwhile, as well, I have elevated Fat Tuesday into February itself, gaining winter's usual 1-3 pounds in one short month. Need to resume walking and swimming soon, so this body I wear won't get too heavy to carry around with me up to the 4th floor of the parking garage..."},

Pillows, yoga mats, gongs, maybe rain sticks, singing bowls, a thunderstorm. At some point my hands began to dance. At times I thought I might be in a science fiction movie. We had little pillowed eye masks so the sense of hearing would be enhanced. It was actually really loud, and I hope my ears survive. But I think we both got sort of healed! Feeling loose and competent today. Even got my tax organizer filled out!I had lunch with my folks, and took them some of my poems for a mini-poetry reading afterwards. My mom has been asking about my poems, so I took a batch of recently accepted ones. (When I got home, it was time to approve a proof of one of these, making it a Random Coinciday in the blog!) They read the typescript afterwards. Mom liked them a lot. Dad fell asleep but also liked them intermittently when he woke up. \"They're very spare and mature,\" he said. I sure hope so! This is my Route 66 year! I'm planning to get my kicks! (Well, that doesn't sound very mature.) I have the appropriate bobby pins and Route 66 earrings for it! See the tiny tires?! (You can get some, too, at Ryburn Place when it reopens in March.)I'm reading several books simultaneously. Sometimes, it's how I sleep. (See my dad, above.) One of them is Really Good, Actually by Monica Heisey, a comedian, about a divorce. Ah, and we just watched 1) the remake, via mini-series, of Scenes From a Marriage, recommended by my daughter and 2) the original Ingmar Bergman film, which, I just realized was also a television mini-series at first, then had a theatrical release as a longish film. The new one is a wonderfully close adaptation, with cool variations, and also very different, contemporary, with a meta aspect that incorporates Covid & masks. Great acting, all around.And I am back at the chalkboard. A poem a day in February and maybe all of Lent. We'll see."},

We got a little cake for Valentine's Day and had just finished it up when my husband got another one to celebrate my birthday. We haven't eaten it yet because we had chocolate milkshakes as part of my requested carryout birthday dinner while we watched episodes of The Last of Us, based on a videogame, recommended by our kids. It contains some hungry people and some excellent eating, plus comic conflict over sandwiches. My birthday dinner involved a cheeseburger and fries. I am still full and still awake, and Fat Tuesday has arrived, and I've retrieved shiny Mardi Gras necklaces and hung them from doorknobs, planning to take some to decorate my mom's doorway when I visit tomorrow. Some are green and can stick around for St. Patrick's Day.My life has a lot of this rolling, get-goofy-things-done quality these days. My tiny chalkboard poems have begun again. Yoga, for various reasons, has once again been set aside, so maybe a poem a day for Lent and a tiny poem a day on the chalkboard will be my new Yoga of Poetry. It's a new deep black chalkboard, as I felt the urge coming on and ordered it...when?! The green chalkboard I used before has been retired, like a basketball star's jersey, as it was the Welcome board for my daughter's wedding and still bears that greeting! In this tiny poem with no punctuation we are both growing older, the poet and the afternoon light.I re-read A Visit from the Goon Squad, by Jennifer Egan, for a book group and to prepare for reading its sequel.* The goon of Time makes this a Random Coinciday in the blog, too. I loved this book, which feels really pertinent right now--the \"pointers\" (babies who like songs and point at them) seem like \"influencers\" on social media--as does The Last of Us, with a pandemic caused not by a virus but by fungi. There were no mushrooms on my cheeseburger.*The Candy House. Yep, Fat Tuesday!"},

So I am reading Circe, by Madeline Miller, a free book that I picked up at church about a witch. Ha! She is confined to her island and is just now, halfway through, meeting Odysseus and showing him her fancy loom, fashioned by Daedalus. (Yes, father of Icarus and maker of wings.) At times, Circe has a \"needle-pricked brain,\" and so do I.Earlier this month, I read the wonderful collection of writings, edited by Jesmyn Ward, The Fire This Time, inspired by current events as well as James Baldwin, of The Fire Next Time. I had been wanting to read Ward's book for a long time, and there it was on a library display table, so I snatched it up! My parents are adjusting to their recent move. Ups and downs. Their new apartment is beautiful, comfy, cozy, and contains their own furniture, paintings, books, family photos, refrigerator magnets, and so on. It was a beautiful move, thanks to the company Beautiful Life. If you need to move, or your parents do, and you live in central Illinois, get in touch with Julie Holliday of Beautiful Life! Also, see if you can get my sister to come help out. She's also a whiz at this! (Ah, I am giving her Circe when I'm done with it!!)Meanwhile, I had curtain speeches to give and talks to facilitate and documents to edit. I had poems to revise and send out. I got an acceptance, yay! That was good news to report to my mom, who is always thrilled when I get a poem accepted (as am I!). Then there was Valentine's Day. My husband and I celebrated as we celebrate every Tuesday morning: senior shopping at 7 a.m. But this time we got a lovely little chocolate mousse cake. And we are still eating it."},
{"title": "A Tale of Two Re-Reads", "date": "Sunday, January 29, 2023", "text": "I am engaged in re-reading two novels with two book clubs, one that meets by Zoom and one in person. They gloriously connect, making it a Random Coinciday in the blog. And one begins with a poem, making it a Poetry Someday! Friday, the Zoom group discussed The Master and Margarita, by Mikhail Bulgakov, one of my favorite novels ever, in part due to its novel-within-the-novel about Pontius Pilate and Yeshua. Right now, I am immersed in the re-reading of A Gentleman in Moscow, by Amor Towles, in which a man is confined to the Metropol Hotel on house arrest. (Is somebody making a movie of this yet?!*) Both novels take place in Moscow during the Bolshevik Revolution and its aftermath, in the 1920s and thereabouts, and on page 84 of A Gentleman in Moscow, Bulgakov is mentioned in a list of beloved Russian poets. In fact (fiction), the book begins with a poem by the beloved (fictional) poet Count Alexander Hyich Rostov, the hero in house arrest.*Wikipedia tells me A Gentleman in Moscow is being adapted into a limited series to be released on Paramount+ and Showtime. It was to star Kenneth Branagh, but now will star Ewan McGregor. OK, then!These two books, along with the Geena Davis memoir I am about to return to the library, have given great calm and delight and relief as I cuddle up on the couch under a blue fleece in the wee hours or the hours in between helping my parents prepare for a big move. Working hard with my wonderful sister, who has returned from Abe & Mary  Lincoln research in Springfield to cook and to sort, organize, launder, etc.--whatever needs doing. So, yes, we are still tidying, and it is still magical. And exhausting. In physical and emotional ways. Reading as a comfort is also the ongoing awakening of empathy, so it all helps.Also, both novels contain significant cats and dogs! They help, too."},

My sister and I have been tidying, organizing, labeling, and \"staging\" in preparation for my parents' move from a 100+ year-old farmhouse (that we grew up in) to a two-bedroom independent living apartment in a retirement community. It's a time of ongoing grief and overwhelming stress, and we haven't been able to engage our parents in \"the life-changing magic of tidying up.\" But we have made headway on organizing, donating, and tossing my mom's clothes and shoes. My dad is another story. (He'll tell it!)To calm down, my sister has left town (she's on a research leave!!), and I have been reading Dying of Politeness, a memoir by Geena Davis. I love Geena Davis! She is fun, funny, smart, a wonderful actress and a world class archer. Her mother had Alzheimer's, making this a Random Coinciday in the blog. I so connect with Geena Davis's shyness. I am so glad she feels more confidence and badassery now! And, wow, about the Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media. She is making a difference in our world!I have also been reading The XX Brain, by Lisa Mosconi, which is 1) not so calming 2) affecting my grocery shopping: more blueberries and (finally available!) salmon. It is disheartening to read, I think in the foreword by Maria Shriver, that Alzheimer's arrives in the brain 20-30 years before it presents. And yet!: it's never too late to increase exercise, start the Mediterranean diet, do crossword puzzles and other brain games, and advocate for oneself with doctors. Sigh...  Lisa Mosconi for women's health and Geena Davis for gender awareness, yay, thank you!!"},

It was looking pretty sparse! Hadn't I just laundered the bedsheets? Um, yes, but then days/weeks went by. So how mindful am I, anyway?But you know what? I have already sent out two poetry submissions, and it's still the middle of January. I don't think I got going on poetry submissions until February of last year. So, poetry or clean underwear, which will it be? Happy to say, both, thank goodness! And one of these submissions contained three poems written this January!! In the new Poems 2023 folder! So that's how on top of it I am at this particular moment, which is the only moment I've got. And in responsible recycling mode, I am re-using my Submissions 2020 folder, which still had room on it for notes, for 2023 submissions. Because I am still tied to paper and pen, in addition to electronic recordkeeping, or my brain will explode/atrophy.Speaking of mindfulness, I know I am probably not very mindful of the present moment when I start writing this blog entry in my head while Rodney Yee is guiding me through two minutes of meditation as I sit cross-legged on the floor.

{"title": "Balance", "date": "Sunday, January 15, 2023", "text": "I'm talking literal balance here, like a flamingo's ability to stand on one leg. Recently I attended a mindfulness hour at my local library, doing fine with the seated meditation portion and noticing a balance issue with the walking meditation. Perhaps it was a rhythm issue, and if I'd been in charge of my own rhythm and pace I'd have had less of a balance problem. But, after we walked in a large circle together around our circle of chairs, the leader did say the first time he tried this he had balance issues!My usual walking meditation is 1) walking on the local trail 2) walking an outdoor labyrinth, just off this same trail. All of this takes place in the three seasons not known as winter! I miss walking outdoors, and I miss a certain balance of mind lately, too, as I am preoccupied these days with some family wamily issues that will sort themselves out pretty soon...though certain stresses will be ongoing. So I was delighted and grateful to discover on the day it was happening that I actually had the mindfulness hour free, could still sign up, and could actually attend.I also practice my balance by 1) putting on pants 2) putting on shoes. Sometimes I try to stand like a crane, one leg straight, one leg bent, to put on each shoe. This morning, by chance, Facebook offered me a picture of the flamingo sculpture at the Tampa airport, making it a Random Coinciday in the blog! Also, I dreamed of putting on a shoe. And often I write poems while walking, a different kind of walking meditation. (Thank you to Wikipedia & Facebook for these images!)"},

Taking yoga class with my daughter in Portland, OR inspired me to 1) stay flexible 2) get more flexible 3) get stronger 4) also resume my arm strength exercises with little two-pound pink hand-held cushiony weights. I could not take my fabulous aqua yoga mat on the plane, but my daughter has extra mats, and told me after our heated yoga class together that I had done fine even though my mat was upside down. (Nerves.) All of us as a family also took the class she taught at another studio. Not a heated class, but right after one, so it was plenty hot, despite the door open to fresh air in the rainy alley between classes!Anyhoo, morning yoga is going fine since then, except for two mornings, including today, when sleep disruption has left me on the couch, sleeping with a book open on my chest. Sigh...  No problem! On those days I can do \"The Yoga of Housework,\" a focussed, meditative, vigorous activity that, like today, might involve changing and laundering the queen-sized sheets. And unfurling different quilts or comforters!\"The Yoga of Housework\" might also involve taking down the minimal holiday decorations, and leaving some up. And, naturally, it re-connects me with Marie Kondo and the art of tidying up! Ah, the shoes I forgot--Navy blue Keds--in my original encounter with \"the life-changing magic of tidying up\" are now in Portland, OR, left behind when my suitcase got too full of hand-me-ups from my daughter (size 8P pants, always welcome!!), so they are now hers, making this a Random Coinciday in the blog!

As you see, this was a $7.99 donut, and it was good. And look at those mangos! Here at home, it has been a tough day, lots going on.

I'm very aware of people's losses and changes and the lingering trauma of these pandemic years. We'll we be walking together, won't we? We got to spend Christmas with our kids in Portland, Oregon, where they both were, amazingly, able to buy houses this fall, after a wild real estate market began to settle down a bit. It was great to see them in their new lives and neighborhoods! We hiked the snowy trail to Tamanawas Falls, and saw the waterfall rushing over frozen sections of itself, misting up into the air and gently raining down on us and the heaps of white snow and blue ice. Just lovely. A magical trail of snow and ice laden trees (primarily cedar and Douglas fir), alternately silent or accompanied by the rushing creek, depending on the bends in the trail. That was Christmas Day.Tuesday morning we visited a charming patisserie, Champagne Poetry, for breakfast. We had delicious treats, coffee, and tea...but, as it was breakfast, no champagne. It's all in shades of pink with a rose wall and neon wings, as evidenced by the wacky picture of me and cooler picture of my son!

Is it enough to get me to move to Iceland? Hmmm. I also love the articles on Best Books of 2022 that crop up this time of year, as well as people's blog posts on their reading. I don't have a best books list, as I wouldn't presume to judge these books, but I did cull from my year's reading 10 books that stood out for me for various reasons.In Love, by Amy Bloom, is on my list and on this cover of BookPage. Subtitled A Memoir of Love and Loss, this is her account of her husband's accompanied suicide in Switzerland. It hits home for many reasons.I read several memoirs this year, and another that stood out was Shy, by Mary Rodgers. Funny, theatre-related, and enlightening, with a background family connection.On Tyranny, the graphic novel version by Timothy Snyder and Nora Krug, a Christmas gift, was exactly what I needed to be reading last January, and I recommended it to my sister, along with passports and magazine subscriptions (Snyder's advice, which I am also following, not with a passport but with a Real ID).My book group read and loved The Lincoln Highway by Amor Towles.I read and loved Horse, by Geraldine Brooks.And also Cher Ami and Major Whittlesey by Kathleen Rooney.A book I'd often heard about but never read, I finally read and loved: Bastard Out of Carolina by Dorothy Allison. Wow!King Dork by Frank Portman led me to Brighton Rock by Graham Greene. More wow! I was struck by how the unlikable main character is moved to tears by music.I re-read and loved all over again The Master and Margarita by Mikhail Bulgakov and recommend it any time it seems appopriate. The Devil comes to Moscow + Yeshua and Pontius Pilate converse.I also re-read Heidi by Johanna Spyri and wept as my childhood rolled over me.Wait! Is that already 10? er, 11?

They have patiently waited for me in the closet, and tolerate my winter layering--long sweaters, scarves, multiple slips, tights, boots--so I can wear them (the dresses) to work. Today I am wearing a sort of fancy black-and-white floral dress, three-quarter length sleeves, not really a summer dress but for an indeterminate season, with a white sweater and a black pashmina, so I can go out to dinner with my husband (and a friend in town from Chicago) for our 33rd (legal) wedding anniversary.

One of the ways to raise awareness is to wear a dress (or a tie) every day for the 31 days of December. I was glad I was wearing a dress--actually, a skirt & top--when I heard about it. I see from their website that they are celebrating their 10-year anniversary, so it took me a while to hear about it. My bad. Going forward, I will try to arrange my (tidied up) wardrobe so I can wear more dresses in December! I hadn't planned to pack any dresses for a hiking/yoga trip we are taking, so I am glad about the tie option, and will have to get creative re: ties. It has also been delightful to find photos of men being Dressember advocates in dresses! But the blurry photo I share here is one of my favorite diaries, with a dress on it!I do feel a little blurry these days, despite my new glasses (trifocals) and updated prescription. There were days of dense fog here, and then rain, and then After Rain, that melancholy book of short stories by William Trevor, also mentioned yesterday, and then I stared and stared at poems I've been writing, wondering 1) how to revise and/or 2) where to submit. Often there was a foggy feeling of, \"I wrote that?\" or \"When did I write that?\" but it was easy to track down, as I had included dates and prompts, etc. I began to feel great empathy, in ways I hadn't before, for people who don't send out their work, or dawdle at it.

Yoga with Rodney Yee, something I do regularly, a little like Groundhog Day, the movie, never progressing beyond Beginner status in yoga, and never getting it right (or ending up with Andie MacDowell). I like remaining a Beginner, and found myself as limber as ever, if a little stiffer in the usual spots, not having resumed A.M. Yoga sooner. In summer, I swim. In three seasons, during good weather, I walk to work. And the rest of the time, I do yoga, or should. It feels so right, and so good. Almost as good as the fabulous head massage I got at Jenni's Salon, right before Stephanie chopped off all my hair. I feel so light and free, also good for the morning yoga!I noticed how I focused on Rodney's voice and the background ocean and music sounds, even as my mind wandered to tasks and/or to words, and my body did all the things it was supposed to do. That sounds like a detachment of mind and body, rather than a union, but I don't care. Everything came back together well enough and as needed. Happy Birthday, Emily! Thank you, Eleanor! And, as ever, thank you, Rodney Yee, who never ages on the beach in Hawaii.Meanwhile, I've been reading lovely and melancholy books: After Rain, a collection of short stories by William Trevor, and In Love: A Memoir of Love and Loss, by Amy Bloom, which I snatched up from the new non-fiction shelf and read in two days. It's about setting up accompanied suicided with Dignitas in Switzerland for Bloom's husband with early-onset Alzheimer's. What a difficult and beautiful thing to do.

{"title": "One Book Leads to Another", "date": "Saturday, December 3, 2022", "text": "Because I am apparently obsessed with reading...I will always tell you about what I am reading. And, in this case, how one book leads to another. King Dork, by Frank Portman, mentions Brighton Rock, by Graham Greene, as the best novel ever. So I ordered that through interlibrary loan, and now I am hooked. And sort of scared, as this is how it opens: \"Hale knew, before he had been in Brighton three hours, that they meant to murder him.\" Has this been made into a movie yet? (Um, yes, but I haven't seen it, and I am not going to until I have read the book!) There are various covers, but this simple \"Collected Edition\" is the one that came to me from Bushnell Public Library in Bushnell, Illinois. Thank you, Bushnell. And I do love Graham Greene.There is a kind of scary face book cover, too. In colors resembling the King Dork book cover, making this a Random Coinciday in the blog. But it is also a Slattern Day, meaning I did no housework, instead walking in the annual Christmas Parade, in the bitter, bitter cold. I knew, however, to wear layers, having walked in several parades over the past few years. Double socks. Undershirt, t-shirt (for Heartland Theatre Company), down vest, long sweater, red coat, blacked knitted Santa-esque boots, black gloves covered by Grinch-green fingerless gloves, a hat with a brim to protect my eyes from the lovely sunshine, and gingerbread man earrings, as the parade theme was \"Season's Eatings, a Gingerbread Affair.\" I ended up toasty warm. We gave out candy canes to the kids, and postcards about the next theatre event to the grownups.In Living with a Wild God, Barbara Ehrenreich mentions Valis, by Philip K. Dick, and I thought, \"I have that, in a bag of paperback science fiction novels, mostly by Philip K. Dick, down in the basement, waiting to be put out in the Little Free Library after the winter.\" (I do think in details and with commas.) So I went down and got it. I love this pattern book cover, but mine is a small paperback with a different cover. If this blog entry gets long enough, I will show you that, too!Oh, it will, it will. Because I need to mention (or re-mention) that the Little Free Library needs to be re-mounted on its own stand, because it used to be mounted on a tree trunk. That tree was a pine tree snapped off in a bad storm one November. We used the top of it as our Christmas tree that year, and chopped up the rest. But, as happens, the remaining trunk rotted this year, we detached the Little Free Library, and toppled the trunk. Sad. Also sad: the lack of a Christmas tree this year, as we will be traveling. Sigh... But I do love my little red butterfly tree in a pot, pictured here, a blog entry about another book! And about leaves and leaf-sucking. All the leaves are gone."},

One is in a project bin beside my computer. I lose track of some of them.It was 16 degrees this morning! But sunny. I went with Ken Kashian, a photographer, to Chenoa, to do a live radio broadcast with Kent Casson, for his show Route 24.

Sometimes I post \"thinking of you\" sentiments on those pages... But, Happy Birthday if I missed you on Facebook. I hope you're still alive! So far, I am, too!I'm reading two books at the moment: Living with a Wild God, by Barbara Ehrenreich, in preparation for the December Adult Reading Challenge at the library, a grown up book, and King Dork, by Frank Portman, a young adult book. I found the latter on our bookshelf, with an inscription from his grandparents, Christmas 2006. He remembers it as hilarious, and I was laughing out loud in bed with it last night, reading a conversation in French class, transcribed into awkward English. This may be my go-to book for laughing myself into utter relaxation and perfect health, and therefore keeping myself alive until my next Facebook Birthday."},
{"title": "Leaves, But No Leavings...", "date": "Sunday, November 27, 2022", "text": "We have raked our leaves toward the street--but not into it, which is bad for the storm drains, etc.--and they await the second coming of the great leaf-sucking machine. We've had glorious warm sunny weather for the Thanksgiving holiday, and I took long walks, alone and with friends. I took a notebook with me on the long walk alone and was grateful to have poems tumble out. I stopped at various benches to write them down. At one I found a key and a dog leash in the leaves underneath, attached the one to the other, hung it over the bench, and moved on to the next. A woman came by, looking at her feet. \"I'm looking for my keys,\" she said. \"I found it,\" I said, \"a single key, and a dog leash.\" \"That's it!\" she said. Yay! We had no leftovers from Thanksgiving dinner this year. I cooked for my parents, a crockpot meal, low salt. No turkey, no stuffing, no ham, no mashed potatoes, no green bean casserole, no pumpkin bread, no orange jello pretzel salad. It makes me a little sad. But I was pleased to see these dishes turn up on other tables in Instagram photos...! Christmas will be a little different this year, too, but fine by me. For instance, this is our tree. Surely, I will still bake pumpkin bread.I read this haunting book of short stories, Under the Moon in Illinois, by Kipling Knox. Really charming, and funny, and poignant, and, yes, sometimes scary. I liked how any ghosts yearned to do good. Then I re-read The Master and Margarita, by Mikhail Bulgakov, in preparation for a progressive discussion, by Zoom, in January. It is also funny, scary, and poignant, and begins with this epigraph from Goethe's Faust:     ...and so who are you, after all?     --I am part of the power which forever wills evil and forever works good.Thank goodness.Oh, but I forgot to tell you that on my long, poetry-tumbling walk, I discovered a Monarch Butterfly sanctuary, with an entrance from the trail! Apparently, monarchs--orange and black--were named for  King William III of England, Prince of Orange! My Christmas-tree monarchs are an impossible but beautiful red! I love them."},
{"title": "Yellow Butterfly", "date": "Sunday, November 13, 2022", "text": "There's a yellow butterfly in the house. It blew in on the big wind a few warm days ago, when various doors were open, and is now alive among the houseplants and plants I brought in from the patio back when frost was predicted. It went down to the twenties last night, and we had a real first snow yesterday. Or first tiny iceball fall. It stuck a while, though not in flake form, and is gone in today's sunshine.I have been tidying again, and now have 5 empty shoeboxes to re-purpose. More shoes I had forgotten are now visible on the rack, and beloved shoes I wore out but was keeping...are gone. As are pants I wore till the seams were giving. And unraveling sweaters. During the process, I did a little decorating and re-organizing of the holiday closet and re-arranging of the wedding garlands, some of which now festoon the glass patio doors, where the yellow butterfly hovers between real and fake greenery. Pale pink appleblossom impatiens are still blooming in a pot that once hung from the eaves, now from a curtain rod.I finished some books in progress so I could 1) put them away on bookshelves 2) pass one along to my book group. We are reading Annette Vallon, by James Tipton, about a real woman who helped resist the awful violence of (and after) the French Revolution. She was the lover of poet William Wordsworth, and the mother of his child, Caroline! I don't think I knew that, and the author in his notes explains how England protected the reputation of their great poet, and Wordsworth \"hid\" her in his writings, as poets often do, but clearly loved her and cared about his child! We chose it from the library display table for The Revolutionists, by Lauren Gunderson, now playing at Heartland Theatre. Funny, moving, devastating play!Poetry submissions continue, but my record-keeping process has changed due to printer (or printer cartridge?) problems. It's probably best that I use less paper and ink, but I am so technology challenged, I dread relying on electronic tracking. So I still write things down, now on empty folders, recycled from teaching days. And that, along with 10 Ways to Recycle a Corpse, by Karl Shaw, which I found on the bookshelf in the middle of a sleepless night, and which had some icky violence by tryants in it, makes it a Random Coinciday as well as a Poetry Someday in the blog!"},
{"title": "Ladder of Years", "date": "Friday, November 4, 2022", "text": "As if to balance the recent rejection, I had a recent acceptance! Of 4 out of the 5 poems I sent to a magazine I had been meaning to send to for a long time, missing its deadline again and again. Because time keeps getting away from me. This batch was a sad one, but it had a ladder in it, leaning on a peach tree, and that makes it a Random Coinciday in the blog. Because I just read--or possibly re-read?--Ladder of Years, by Anne Tyler, a sort of sweet, sad novel about a woman who walks away from her family one day... I could picture myself doing it as she did it, much as I love and would never leave my family, other than that time in Chicago when I walked out the back door and down to the streetlight while my toddler crawled around on the dining room floor at the feet of my husband and father, who were talking about politics and real estate. Really, this was not meant to be a Cranky Doodle Day in the blog. That was years ago. My kids are grown. I'm still married to the same man, and today, early in the morning, I looked all through the house for him and then saw the ladder on the patio, leaning against the house, and found him on the roof, sitting cross-legged at the edge, scooping leaves from the gutter into a plastic bag, during a Wind Advisory. It was a little like the time I was down in the church basement during a tornado, and the rain was horizontal, and the neighbor from across the street had come out to tell my husband, scooping leaves on the roof, that he should go inside. But not as windy, and I was there smiling and talking to him, waiting till he was done before going back inside...I may have read it before...but I didn't know what was going to happen. Books are often different the second time you read them, especially if a lot of life has happened in between. I have walked along many a beach since then, but not at the ocean for a long time now, and the annual summer lake vacation is done... Yes, time keeps getting away from me. But this version of the cover, the one I read, a copy I picked up at the ongoing library sale, is warmer, sort of peachy in a way, and has a hat with a brim, which I need to protect my eyes."},

I am glad that it's Friday! I'm exhausted and, indeed, grateful. Grateful, in part, that I will raise a glass (of blessings) at book group tonight, discussing Notes from a Young Black Chef, by Kwame Onwuachi. Grateful that 1) both parents are getting better, little by little and 2) my dad will have a follow-up appointment tomorrow, to relieve (I hope) some ongoing discomforts. Grateful for the support of hubby and siblings during this trying time.Grateful that I had dessert first--if not ice cream for dinner--earlier this week at the history museum, a thank-you celebration for those of us who worked on the annual cemetery walk. It was an ice cream social, with excellent ice cream, mix-ins, and both caramel and chocolate syrups! We got to color--with markers--little wooden Halloween pins. Our table had ghosts saying, \"Boo!\" Other tables had pumpkins and bats. Grateful that my little pin turned up, which I thought I had (immediately) lost!Grateful that I got to see a Halloween parade of little ones in costume at the library! I hope I remember to wear my lacy white witch's hat with a white owl on top to the library on Monday! Grateful to have seen Batman walking down the sidewalk as I emerged from the parking garage today in beautiful Uptown Normal! Batman!!OK, I did label this post a Cranky Doodle Day in the blog, but I am not now cranky, not at all. There was a lingering crankiness earlier this week, from various things, but it has lifted! I am even grateful for the latest poetry rejection because it was a nice no, wanting to see more, from a major publication! I have gotten their standard rejection before, so I know they mean it. Wooee! Yes to no!Grateful that I finally got to train our new Artist Watch editor at EIL via phone call and simultaneous work at the site. Both of us have already busy lives with extra stuff going on right now. Grateful that I made further progress on a book review before the next interruption. Grateful that I can run errands for my parents! Grateful (and amazed) that both my kids bought houses this month! That a local friend found her dream house. That another friend is slowly getting better after a fall.... That blogger friends who were sad are beginning to come back to joy.Did I mention that I saw Batman?!"},

Wishing you all relief from your own worries, and joy in the changing season. I took a lovely walk with friends yesterday, full of light and color, as the leaves drifted down on the hiking-biking trail. Mary, with the fitbit among us, said, \"10,000 steps.\" Reading helped during the stress, a way to step aside, as did doing crossword puzzles in old New Yorkers, passed along to me by my mom, for me to read and recycle. \"Watch out,\" she said, \"you can get hooked.\" I did. Going to and from the hospital in Peoria, we had lunch twice, and pie once, at Busy Corner, a popular eating place at, yes, a busy corner. And saw the colors of the changing leaves by the side of the road. A joy to my mom. Less so to my colorblind dad, but his joy was getting out of the hospital!Reading books with colorful covers, too. Balladz by Sharon Olds and Where Are the Snows by Kathleen Rooney, the latter in my stack of books to review for Escape Into Life. I need to 1) read slowly and repeatedly for a review 2) have a clear mind, ability to focus...so I am behind in this task. But I got the laundry done! Plus, these two books look great on my coffee table.My own poetry waits patiently for me to get back to it. I have a composition book at hand for bits of inspiration. I flip back through the pages and see lots of actual poems there, awaiting revision and assembly. I have sent out a few things, received a few rejections, and one wonderful acceptance. A nice surprise. I'll keep on. Many more steps."},

So: 2 ER trips by ambulance in the same week, one for each parent. Both involving the nose, and blood, to make it a Random Coinciday in the blog. But we are getting through, with a little help from our friends, support from family, and polite and patient health care professionals. Thank you, OSF! Thank you, Devon, for the apple butter, Ellen, for the extra coffee maker, and Kim, for ongoing support and friendship. Thanks to siblings & their spouses and my own hubby, too! My dad got a lowdown ride in his Miata at one point. Talk about random!I think I need a walk in the chilly sunshine. I will go mail letters at the P.O. and walk through the Sugar Creek Arts Festival, instead of the nightwoods. I will catch up on work and sleep when I can. And Now I Spill the Family Secrets, by Margaret Kimball, is a fascinating memoir & graphic novel I read for the yearround Adult Reading Challenge at the Normal Public Library. October is graphic novel month. I have had a pretty graphic October so far."},

It was fun to re-encounter the sisters Belinda and Harriet (middle-aged \"spinsters\") knowing that Pym as a young woman had imagined a life similar to the one she later lived, roommates with her own middle-aged sister!And imagine my delight, after having read the Marie Kondo book on tidying up (as both a physical and spiritual activity), on finding this passage in Some Tame Gazelle:\"'It's no use being sentimental about things,' said Harriet. 'You shouldn't keep a clutter of clothes you never wear just because you once liked them.'\"Belinda made no comment on this, for she was thinking that Harriet's words might be applied to more serious things than clothes. If only one could clear out one's mind and heart as ruthlessly as one did one's wardrobe...\"I'm glad I got rid of clothes and books this summer, but not my goofy little Pym paperbacks! With weirder covers than anything shown here. And I'm working hard, but I hope generously not ruthlessly, on clearing out my mind and heart!It's been an exhausting couple of weeks. Partly because of the annual cemetery walk last week, a lovely community event, for which we had excellent weather, and partly because this week my mom had a fall. She is fine now, amazingly healthy overall, but it was stressful and scary for everyone, especially her. She is so glad to be home. Me, too, and so glad it's Friday. Chilly. It will be the coldest year ever for the Sugar Creek Arts Festival, moved from July to October to avoid the heat...but now folks had better be bundled up in layers! Art in the streets!! And maybe funnel cakes and elephant ears! And kettle corn! Hoping my mom stays home this year. But we have found her cane! And maybe I could find a few more at the arts festival! To leave here and there around the house...Hey, there are actually gazelles on this last sample book cover! Wait! Is it possible that Marie Kondo used Barbara Pym as an epigraph to her own book, and I had already encountered this random coincidence?! I don't know! I gave the book away! Twice!!"},

I've been a longtime writer of scripts and scenes for this walk through Evergreen Memorial Cemetery, where community members and schoolkids can meet the people who are buried there, and, in the past, I played many characters and this year will do so again. It's an exhausting but rewarding experience! As actors, we do two rounds of six performances each on the weekends, and three rounds on schooldays for field trips during the week, in all kinds of weather. It used to fall in October, and now it's bumped up to September and the first weekend of October, because the schoolkids were not wearing jackets and appropriate attire in the cold or rainy weather! My character is Helen Clark McCurdy (1866-1962), who ran for office. It's also spider season, and all the webs are up!Other things on my mind:Second blooming of a lilac bush that touches the sidewalk on my walk to work.The mulberry bush wrapping a purple smokebush in the same yard.The glorious breezy, sunny weather this Sunday afternoon.Barbara Pym, as I am reading a vignette-style biography of her, The Adventures of Miss Barbara Pym, by Paula Byrne. I discovered her when I was working at DePaul University as an assistant to the secretrary of the English Department, before I got my graduate degree there, and had submitted a story to the student creative writing magazine, that was accepted and published, and one of the woman professors compared me to Barbara Pym. So I had to find out about her. I hope it was my quirky, comic style in that particular story!The coincidence of Pym at Oxford + visiting Germany around the time of the Hitler and Chamberlain, etc. agreement to give Sudetenland back to Germany from Czechoslovakia, who was not consulted nor at the talks or signing, and the film we watched last night, Munich: The Edge of War, based on the novel Munich, by Robert Harris, which I guess I will now not have to read...Rejections, which are now rolling in, from a batch of submissions.

What a great turnout of both participants and parade viewers! So many laborers! All the unions were out, as we have a workers' rights referendum on the ballot on November 8. (Vote Yes!) So many candidates! So much candy.August exhausted me, and not just with all the Sealey Challenge poetry reading, which also enlightened and energized me. Lots of brain energy of other sorts these days. Plus...termites. Yup. Sigh. So they are gone, we hope for good, as we got the whole treatment, burned any wood or cardboard from shed or garage that might have tiny critters, and dumped even more in Marie Kondo fashion! It's like the house fire a few years back. Anything left in the attic, that might have been damaged by smoke or water, I dumped, without much perusal. This time, anything left stacked in the basement near the termite wall...went.But the joy and comic relief came with the book Shy, by Mary Rodgers and Jesse Green, subtitled The Alarmingly Outspoken Memoirs of Mary Rodgers. It was hilarious and very informative. Mary Rodgers wrote Once Upon a Mattress (sometimes I burst into song with \"The Swamps of Home\") and Freaky Friday. Plus, my parents' lives crossed with hers, sort of. Mom and Dad met her sister, Linda, then married to Dan Melnick, in the army. Apparently, they hung out together at Fort Sill army base in Lawton, Oklahoma. Dorothy Rodgers, mother of Mary and Linda, invented the Johnny Mop, a toilet-cleaning tool, a version of which I use today! Well, not today!

And I read the whole bundle from Bull City Press, and its Frost Place Chapbook Competition. A fine gathering!The poet grew up in Iran, and it was lovely to find that the title poem is a ghazal. Subtle yet tight rhyme ripples through the book. Ah, but the sad irony of the closing lines of \"Persian Poetry\": \"Yet I study English poetry / because Persian would have been too obvious.\"Swans drift through, or paddleboats in the shape of swans, as in \"The Yellow Swan\" and \"Swan Boats.\" I found the coincidence of blue in \"Swan Boats\": \"Time out of mind, this was our turquoise blue     mind out of time, watching white thoughts come, go     across a mirror which, unchanged by them,     itself was change and could reverse the down-     ward wish of light, the headlong wash of stone     skipped on its current.Lovely language, lovely reversals there.This morning I woke early, found a wishing star on the horizon in a dip of trees, and wished what I always wish.

Look at that lovely, strange cover image by Kansuke Yamamoto, A Chronicle of Drifting (1949, gelatin silver print collage). There are several Japanese sources and inspirations in the book, plus Joseph Cornell, and an erasure of Tanaka's own dissertation, with echoes of The Waves (Virginia Woolf) and Nightwood (Djuna Barnes). All amazing and creating its own new drifting experience in reading...!In another sad connection to What is the What, my simultaneous reading, I found a landmine on p. 5 of Séancein Daylight, in the poem \"Death in Parentheses.\" I found ghosts and butterflies and the color blue in other resonances with the month's poetry reading. So much beauty, mixed with sadness, as in this couplet from \"The Empire of Light\":     Soon I am going home. Changed, forgotten--     a girl in a barren field, pressing twilight to her throat.And this, from \"Discourse on Vanishing,\": \"She tries / to capture a blue flower as it vanishes / in a garden.\"My purple coneflowers are vanishing, except for the seedheads, left for the birds.

But here is the August coincidence from Blue Hour, by Carolyn Forche (HarperCollins, 2003): \"Our windows faced east, and on August evenings, the sky was a blue no longer spoken.\" And it's also a Blue Monday in the blog.The \"blue hour,\" as the helpful Notes at the end explain, is \"the light the French call l'heure bleue, between darkness and day, between the night of a soul and its redemption, an hour associated with pure hovering.\" It is the hour she would wake with her baby son. From the title poem: \"When my son was an infant we woke for his early feeding at l'heure bleue--cerulean, gentian, hyacinth, delft, jouvence. What were also the milk hours.\"Other favorite lines and phrases, some blue: \"In the blue silo of dawn, in earth-smoke and birch copse / where the river of hands meets the Elbe.\"\"a confusion of birds and fishes\"\"a memory through which one hasn't lived\"\"a moment of bluesmoke\"\"l'heure bleue, hour of doorsteps lit by milk\"\"pinning their intentions to a saint's dress\"\"meaning did not survive that loss of sequence\"\"something broken and personal, a memory\"\"the stories nested, each opening to the next\"I should have anticipated this, as Forche is a poet of witness, but I didn't expect how strongly Blue Hour, especially its long abecedarian poem \"On Earth,\" would connect to the other book I am currently reading, What is the What, by Dave Eggers, a novel based on the true story of Valentino Achak Deng, one of the Lost Boys of Sudan. He and other orphans walked from Southern Sudan to Ethiopa, hoping for aid and relief, witnessing terrible things, including the murder of parents, siblings, and friends, beatings, death from hunger and fatigue. Some of Forche's lines stuck out as something one of these boys might see: \"in this camp, so many refugees\" or \"the little notebook of poems in the pocket of a corpse.\" \"On Earth\" has beautiful things in it, but also terrible things, a litany of everything that can and does occur. This couplet in it even matches the novel's title in a way:     the what is? gives the wrong answer     the what is? has ruined thoughtas does the litany of \"what\" in the W section of the poem. And the ending, of the poem, since the beginning of the novel recounts a robbery:     your things have been taken     your things have been taken away"},
{"title": "Saints", "date": "Sunday, August 28, 2022", "text": "My copy of Saints, by Reginald Gibbons (Persea Books, 1986), with its faint scent of damp, belonged to someone else, is signed and inscribed, somebody local, now gone. I am reading layers of lines in it, what's written, how this book's previous reader may have received it, and my usual and ongoing connections to other poetry books I've read this August. As I mentioned yesterday, this title seemed like it might be good Sunday reading, and I turned first to a poem called \"Sermon of the New Preacher,\" which is exactly that, a sermon, in prose. The preacher is exhorting his listeners not to make excuses for their crimes of the heart:But Brother, you say. Brother, I have needs, I'm in trouble, or I'm in pain, or I have sorrows and worries and wounds! I'm in debt, and my son won't straighten out, and my wife doesn't love me the way she once did, Brother, I'm talking about me!The marriage lament reminds me of lines in Corinne Lee's Pyx, and there is a similar loving wish for childen in Gibbons's \"Elsewhere Children\" but now for everyone's children, and the lost children of the homeless woman in a doorway: \"As for wishing you always free of ordinary pain     like a father's or a mother's, I might     as well wish food into dead refrigerators     and the warmth to come out of these store-windows     into the street and do some good.Gibbons's own tender domestic poems alternate with poems of public concern, several in Chicago settings I recognize, having lived there, and poems in other voices. \"The Vanishing Point\" shows us a man drawing \"a severely rectilinear highway scene\" in the subway station at Chicago and State. (Been there.) \"American Trains\" resonates with the train-riding poems in Dynamite, except Gibbons is mostly writing about passenger trains and Carlson-Wee was riding the rails via freight trains. Right up until the end, where the train also becomes metaphorical, I think:     and there's the one you and I got on,          that started downhill with the weight          of what we felt and is still a plummet,          always and always faster till it has us shaking,          out of breath, scared... \"A freight train,\"          I said when you asked me, \"What is this?\"The section/long poem called \"Saints\" begins with an epigraph by Allen Tate: All violent people secretly desire to be be curbed by something they respect, so that they may become known to themselves. Gibbons incorporates the epigraph in the section called \"In the Violent Ward,\" adding his own wisdom in the voice of the violent, or once violent:     we can't be sure we want to get well---     once you go out, time starts again     your wounds may heal     and you'll want to wound someone.That does seem to be the way of it, so often. And Gibbons has also described and anticipated the current state of the political world in America in this stanza from his sad but rollicking \"The Snarling Dog (A Song, Loud & Rough)\":     Have you heard people tell of the danger to us all     when this one's elected or that one breaks jail?     It's twice what you heard anyone tell     and they got the snarling dog on a chain at heel.Well, the dog days of August are officially, almanacally over, I guess, but I'll be out there today, forecast to be hot and humid, for the local Sweet Corn Circus, with circus gymnasts and steamed sweet corn in the streets, right after church."},
{"title": "Pyx", "date": "Saturday, August 27, 2022", "text": "Finding the next book to read each day, here in the August Sealey Challenge, is sometimes entirely random, sometimes speculative or intuitive. As the weekend approached, I saw that Pyx, by Corinne Lee, and Saints, by Reginald Gibbons, books in my stacks in baskets (both coincidentally in the National Poetry Series) had titles tending toward potential Sunday reading. \"Pyx\" is a container for the Eucharist. When I opened Pyx to the first poem, \"Lysistrata Motley,\" I found an immediate coincidence, since yesterday's poet, Jessy Randall, references Lysistrata in Mathematics for Ladies: \"Oh, ladies, you hear what I'm saying loud and clear. / Have you read Lysistrata?\" So Pyx it is!But for today, Saturday, aka Slattern Day in the blog, not Sunday. (Though, truthfully, I have already done some housework.)From \"Lysistrata Motley,\" in Pyx, I learned: \"The Egyptians jettisoned     a mummy's cerebrum, knowing     the heart should do     all thinking.Good to know, in all the ways. More coincidence: \"Conveniently, the fabulous hat / appears // on the bed.\" Lines that bring back all the fabulous hats I saw last night in a production of Crowns, by Regina Taylor, with the Coalescence Theatre Project. And here's another: \"Going over the falls / in a barrel / with the dreamed of, but born awry.\" Out of its context, but wonderful on its own, and evoking, for me, the cover of The Niagara River!Everything connects, and a month of poetry confirms it!The once again helpful notes at the end of Pyx alerted me to how the poem \"After the Caves\" connects to Helen Frankenthaler's Before the Caves and Frida Kahlo's Self-Portrait with Thorn Necklace and Humningbird. The latter also connects with Lee's poem \"Self-Portrait with Thorn Necklet and Crow,\" which begins, \"Loneliness / of coral. But beyond yonder window, a spoon bends,\" showing you the simultaneity of emotion and surreal images in Pyx. These lines from \"After the Caves\" hurt in themselves and made me seek out the painters and paintings:          If born with plenary,     the infant     daughter might have had     a rib like mine.     Instead, this portrait     of woman as table.     Carved by opener     of the body.The next poem, \"Our Lady of the Divine Sacrum,\" made me look up the word \"picador,\" also the name of a publisher I like. A picador is a kind of horseman in a bullfight, like other figures (matador, toreador), one who lances the bull to keep his head down. I looked it up in an actual book dictionary in the middle of the night, sleep still awry (to use a word from one of the poems!). Will there now be nightmares?Indeed, this book has its own logic, like a dream. I celebrate each time I connect, as if I might be interpreting the dream correctly. Having written a Bigfoot poem myself, I delight to read \"As Bigfoot, I Interpret Our Heyday,\" even though it's a lament about a bad time in a marriage. I connect to \"Excavation\" in its relentless need to protect children, their vulnerability. These children have gone on a mock archeological dig:          Like my shoveling toddlers, I want     the world to be pristine,     of my design--playground wounds like zippers, raptors     that only kiss dumpling hands.I do love the more \"domestic\" poems in Pyx, the tumbling love of children, as well as the overall love of language in it. I love how philosophy slips in gently, relentlessly, alongside the quotidien: \"Since we reside in a garden, / there is no purpose / but pollen.\" And to see, or assume, that the marriage survives, there is continued family life! Or does it slip away?          There was the night     we wed, you feeding me marzipan pawpaws     with your teeth. Our love     not yet shrouded     by time's daft--but accurate--disguises.And, though not named as August, there is an August feel to the opening of \"Substratum\":     Setting paper cups     of Shiraz     at yarrow's edges     for the elves. The cicadas throbbing.The cicadas are still throbbing here, where I am, in August."},
{"title": "Mathematics for Ladies", "date": "Friday, August 26, 2022", "text": "Yesterday I got a package in the mail from England! With a book in it: Mathematics for Ladies, by Jessy Randall (Goldsmiths Press, 2022)! I'll be reviewing it for Escape Into Life, as Jessy Randall is an EIL poet, and you can find several of the book's poems here (Women in Math and Science), here (Three by Jessy Randall), here (Work Poems), and here (Dog Days), but this Sealey Challenge reading in August will be my first quick, holistic read-through, and I'll peruse more closely in subsequent readings. For now, I will point out the coincidence of Mary Anning and ammonite in two of these poetry books this August, this one and The Genesis Machine! (In my notes: Have Jessy Randall and Jeanne Wagner found/met each other yet?!)This book has cool illustrations by Kristin DiVona and cover art by Ilyanna Kerr! Woo, also, I am thanked in the front of this book! Neato! The book has helpful notes at the end, a works-cited list, and a foreword, which sounds scholarly, and is, but the book and notes are also often quite funny, as is Jessy Randall. You'll see! Ah, but I am schooled on this in the poem \"Rachel Bodley (1831-1888)\":     Stop requiring women     to be charming and delightful!     Just let us do our work.     Thank you.But, see, even that's funny, due to the comic timing of the last line. And, to quote \"Honor Fell (1900-1986),\" which is partly a poem about a ferret at a wedding, \"Let's agree to laugh about it while we do our work.\" All these women did their work, often not laughing, diligently and with obstacles, as you can imagine. The titles are their names and birth and death dates, spanning centuries. Pippa Goldschmidt's foreword tells us the word \"scientist\" was coined in the 1830s to describe a woman--Mary Somerville--\"because the standard phrase 'man of science' was now clearly out of date.\" I did not know that! Racism as well as sexism impeded the careers of many of the women scientists and mathematicians in the book, but they get their say, through the voice and imagination of Jessy Randall, in fierce poems after the fact.Also, the title, Mathematics for Ladies, which sounds dismissive, and was, actually pertains to \"a new kind of math, // descriptive math, something more like / philosophy\" that women practiced more in the past and men love today--abstract math, rather than applied math.I love the caterpillars in \"Maria Sibylla Merian (1647-1717),\" a poem that reveals, I think, the moral superiority of Merian (\"She learned art just so she could draw them\") over Audubon, the painter of birds.     She drew her caterpillars from life,     never pinning them to a board.     It did not occur to her to kill them     to hold them still. They stayed still     in her mind, where it mattered.Audubon killed his birds. And, oh, the amazingly huge jellyfish described in \"Elizabeth Cabot Agassiz (1822-1907)\"! And the authority in the voice of spider-loving \"Mary Treat (1830-1923)\":     When I found the lily     I knew it was something.     I schooled Darwin on bugs.     I'm steady. I'm plain. I write     like a woman and invite readers in.I bet you'll feel invited in by Jessy Randall's steady, plain voice in these poems, too. Every one made me want to know more about the woman and her work!"},

Early this morning, I picked up Break the Glass, by Jean Valentine (Copper Canyon Press, 2010), and could not put it down. The poems felt both fragmentary and liquidy, like pieces floating or somehow flowing...with little punctuation to stop the flow. That body of water with bodies in it, which looks like people standing, is an installation in Germany by Antony Gormley, called Another Place (1997, cast iron/100 elements), photographed by Helmut Kunde. The poems dropped me in another time and place, some celebrating Lucy, that early hominid, and who knew I'd find the coincidence of the word Australopithecus in three books this August, two books of poetry and one about teeth.The watery feel is there in \"The Japanese garden\":     It might be under water,     the birds be fish, colored in.     And you,     maksed reader:          the glance     of your underwater lamp,     your blackwater embrace---     not bought or sold.I also found the coincidence of elephants in \"Ghost Elephants\" and a novel I read for narrative escape, The Elephant's Journey, by Jose Saramago. \"In the elephant field / tall green ghost elephants / with your cargo of summer leaves\"True, Valentine's elephants appear to be plants. The coincidence of blue in the remarkable \"Then Abraham,\" combining the Abraham/Isaac story with a Vermeer painting:     Still, all the history of the world     happens at once: In the rain, a young man     holds out a blue cloth     to caress her head...And the coincidence of reading the phrase \"in a rainstorm\" in a rainstorm this morning, one we needed, though it weighed down the branch of Rose of Sharon with its last lavender blooms.Lucy is also known as \"'Dinkenesh,' an Amharic language term meaning 'You are beautiful.'\" And arouses our empathy. \"No one is so tender in her scream.\" And connection:               when my scraped-out child died Lucy     you hold her, all the time.And when I read, \"The nine wild turkeys come up calmly to the porch / to see you, Lucy,\" I recalled our neighborhood flock of wild turkeys, their calm visits to us all, driveway by driveway, yard by yard.I loved \"Outsider Art\" for itself, for the artist it celebrates, Martin Ramirez, and for its astonishing end to writer's block:    When writing came back to me     I prayed with lipstick     on the windshield     as I drove."},
{"title": "Dynamite", "date": "Wednesday, August 24, 2022", "text": "Today's book for the Sealey Challenge is Dynamite, by Anders Carlson-Wee (Bull City Press, 2015).This one is, for real, hard-hitting, as they say, beginning, with the title poem, \"Dynamite\":     My brother hits me hard with a stick     so I whip a choke-chain     across his face. We're playing     a game called Dynamite     where everyting you throw      is a stick of dynamite     unless it's pine.Imagination or reality, dream or dumpster dive, it all hurts. There's more fighting later, and a \"Polaroid\" to prove it. The brothers ride the rails, and one brother rides alone. Even so, and over time     You have learned very little.     But that little is what you are throwing     in the furnace. That little is stoking the dust-     coals of last year and burning something.      Burning blue.There are owls, train-related (glossary in back) or avian. There is fishing, in \"The Raft,\" and I'm sure there was fishing earlier in this August of poetry.  And riding the train. There are guns and dust and mold, wisdom, tenderness, and \"Life out of nothing.\" In \"County 19,\" the speaker/poet hitchhikes by the old folks home his grandmother lived, lingers a while, then says he'll go \"as far as you can take me.\" In another poem, he honors \"Moorcroft\": \"You gave me a ride when I was lost in Wyoming.\"Lost, but maybe found. \"I've heard it said that the kingdom of heaven / surrounds us though we fail to see.\""},
{"title": "Connotary", "date": "Tuesday, August 23, 2022", "text": "This was a lovely book to read outdoors on a lovely day, Connotary, by Ae Hee Lee (Bull City Press, 2021), with a lovely cover, Green Flash, by Stephanie Law. I don't know what \"connotary\" means, but maybe there's an idea of connotations. Each poem title has a doubleness built into it, and each poem evokes place, or memory, or connection. In the first, \"Hyu::In-Between,\" I learned about real jujubes, not the candy jujubes I remember from my own childhood: \"It's a quiet     and passionate affair--to dwell          in the meanwhile, with a waiting so bright     red like the beads of jujube fruits          our grandmother used to dry     out in the yard, so they would amass all          the sweetness of the world in their little bodies.That right there shows you how the poems will somehow do the same! I appreciate the cooking, the eating. In \"Kimchi::In Trujillo\":      My mother's measuring tool: her intuition, her philosophy     that a fixation with perfection deters one from pouring jeong     into the food. Jeong, she teaches me, is love     that comes with time...I loved, in \"El Milagro::Edges,\" the eating of a pineapple down to its core, or not, depending on your culture, and how its juicy sweetness relates back to this:     Once I read each heart knows     its own bitterness,     and no one else     can share its joy.And ends up here:     She eats until her hands empty,     while I don't. It's hard     and not so sweet.I learned so much from this book, and I hope you will, too. And that you will love the surprise of the perfect ending. That also pours its jeong into the world."},
{"title": "Should Our Undoing Come Down Upon Us White", "date": "Monday, August 22, 2022", "text": "I woke up to dense dog, the world gently white outside the window, and picked up this snowy white book, Should Our Undoing Come Down Upon Us White, by Jill Osier (Bull City Press, 2013), cover painting by Marina Mariya. The first poem suggests it (the poem itself, perhaps the book) won't be telling the whole story, not yet, but that it \"is not about loss,\" a momentary comfort, but maybe it is, or about waiting, or about readiness.I wasn't ready to spot coincidences on this Blue Monday in the blog, but I found \"a dead-blue tulip\" in the poem \"Last Dream of Flowers.\"The poems are quiet and gripping, like a cold and snowy day at the edge of the woods, silence fallen. The title poem begins:     Even while we talked, snow must have been falling. Now it's a scar:     I've mostly failed in the rooms     of honesty and forthrightness.Then there's the story of a child sledding.I find myself reading and re-reading these snow-packed or gently drifting poems. I see little flickers of red and flame and skies and fields of snow. In \"Flame,\":                                   Your heart, red wax,     slipped soft from its nail. I shaped it back, and the two of us lay waiting     in a cabin's draft.What if you could live in a box, a camera obscura?     A small, simple box with a tiny hole     for light to come through,     make everything clearer?Or a snow globe? In the middle of the book, in the middle of the poem \"Obscura,\" the scene becomes object suddenly:     Shaking the scene now, snow falls,     smoke rising up to meet it.I am not ready for winter. I am not ready for snow. It is only August. Ah, but those first yellow sweet gum leaves already litter the yard."},
{"title": "Henry Kissinger, Mon Amour", "date": "Sunday, August 21, 2022", "text": "From the title, you can tell this might be a dark, hilarious book. And it is. It's really dark, so dark it sometimes swallows up the hilarity, and all the horror of world politics shines through. A paradox, that shining. Henry Kissinger, Mon Amour, by Conor Bracken, is another of the wonderful Bull City Press books, this one from 2017, but, since it's about the polarizing figure of Henry Kissinger, seems to fit the general polarization of now. The cover art, Overflow, by Jenny Blazing (2017, acrylic, collage), looks like a city turning into a waterfall--so it brings to mind The Niagara River, by Kay Ryan, and its cover--but it might be a dam, its mechanisms overcome...which, yes, also describes the book--how loving the machinations of a world maker/breaker transforms things or sort of obscures and reveals what's really going on...I was delighted to find the poems \"jogging through August,\" like me, on p. 13, in \"Henry Has Me Tell Him About My First Time,\" which is a pretty icky and not very delightful account of unwanted attentions, in a swamp. As you can imagine.Another coincidence was the color blue again, in the amazing \"Henry Pats His Heart for Emphasis,\" in the line, \"I hold his x-rays to the moon's blue light.\" The poem keeps trying to figure out if Henry has a heart:     If it mutters to itself at night upset     by coups planned late, worrying that it left     the serial numbers on the submachine guns.You get the idea! And the dark hilarity! And the speaker is quite up front about his/her/their (?) complicity, as in \"How American\":     Henry and I, we're as American     as an overdose of opiates,     our bodies red and white and blue     and bloated. American as rural poverty      and tort law, fingers lopped off by gears     that move fast as the cruise missile in his living room     we take turns straddling like a mustang,     whispering hoarsely \"ashes to ashes,     lust to lust.\"Dark, right? And I love the pun in \"hoarsely.\" And it's amazing how the poems really are love poems, as in the last stanza of the poem \"Henry Talks About the Hyenas,\" an unlikely title for such a lovely turn at the end, when, Henry having chosen the descriptor \"velvety\" for the night, this happens:     The night a curtain     we can roughen with one hand     and smooth with the other.Which also describes the manipulation of world politics, eh?More (scary) blue in \"Call Me Condor\": \"before dragging me from the air's blue throat.\" More marvelous (scary) imagery: \"the sun still zipping the river / up in a yellow body bag.\" The continued mix of love and horror--in \"How Mercy Works\" (by blame and cruelty)--and in the wordplay of the title, \"The Hands With Which Henry Puts The Casual Back in Casualty.\" But you know it's going to be this way from the very first poem, with its funny title, \"The Tao of Henry,\" and that short poem's last two lines:     Keep your boot on the throat of the season.     With your good eye dare the horizon to shrug."},
{"title": "To Be Read in the Dark", "date": "Saturday, August 20, 2022", "text": "I love how I finished reading this one in the dark! That is, at night! A glorious summer night, after an exciting in-and-out rainy day. We need more rain, but I am also happy for summer to last as long as it can and for fantasy/Camelot (only rains after sundown) to reign as long as it can. The book is To Be Read in the Dark, by Maxine Chernoff, a Chicago/San Francisco poet (Omnidawn, 2011).I loved the immediate coincidence of blue, in the very first poem, \"The Box,\" itself an accidental/prescient, pre-pandemic enclosure coincidence!     blue as memory's     alien air     you     blue as     the worldThe word \"alien\" is also an amazing coincidence re: yesterday's book, which uses the word \"alien\" in a number of ways!I loved the phrase, and the personal/universal resonance of \"memory's edge / is too demanding\" in the poem, \"There Will Be Consequences,\" the title of which also resonates with my upbringing. I loved the coincidence of \"cardboard scenery\" (theatre/unlikely) and \"circumference\" (Emily Dickinson, etc.)I loved \"How I Wrote Certain of My Books\" for 1) its title and 2) the coincidence of mountain in \"mountain's white page\" (in part, in connection to Heidi, oddly!)And I loved, and grieved, the last poem's aching, ever pertinent, perennial question, \"What Did You Do in the War?\" and how it devolves into \"moments reduced / to cicada and vision,\" still going on in my own back yard in August....The other day I tried to give away a bunch of wonderful poetry books and chapbooks at an open mic event, but, like me, after reading the Marie Kondo book, many people these days are avoiding more accumulation of books, no matter how much they love them! If you, however, as readers of a poetry/reading blog by a blogger who attempts the Sealey Challenge each August, if you would like a little box of books, a sampling of the kinds of things I read and respond to here, please send me an email (via the Contact-Info page of this blog, above) with your address and I'll send some along! You might create a little pile in readiness for next August, adding things you select on your own to the little grab-bag I'll send you. It might take me a while to send it off--busy here!--but I'll get to it eventually. If there's a particular book you want, that you've seen here this August or a past August, let me know, but I will probably save/set aside some of these books for sentimental reasons...and won't send them off till I do the sentimental weeding stage of the Kondo cleanout. Sigh... I love books."},
{"title": "Wild Fox of Yemen", "date": "Friday, August 19, 2022", "text": "Here in August, during the Sealey Challenge, I love the immersion in lives, languages, and cultures not my own. In this book, The Wild Fox of Yemen, by Threa Almontaser (Graywolf Press, 2021), I also loved tracking the wild fox, its brief appearances, its changing meanings...and, as keeps happening, tracking the coincidences--how the books or images in them keep connecting, or how my mind is doing that. I encountered the Tooth Fairy in the nonfiction book, The Tales Teeth Tell, but I was surprised to find her here, in the very first poem, \"Hunting Girliness,\" \"It is not tasteful / to fuck with the Tooth Fairy, baby teeth planted // in the oleanders.\" (And I just made the connection that she is \"hunting\" girliness, like a fox!)Teeth again, and precise dental terminology, in \"Recognized Language,\" \"Now the words shed from my mouth like deciduous teeth.\" Here is the wild fox in \"Heritage Emissary\":                                    At dinner,     Baba tells a story of his childhood in Yemen.     About catching a wild fox with his cousin---Arabic     the medium through which his body can return home.But imagine my surprise at the coincidence of sharks in the next poem: \"In Yemen, I loved sharking / the tall mountains, twining my hair w/ hawk bones.\" And the coincidence of hair: \"I refused to straighten.\" I loved learning, from \"Etymology of Hair,\" that \"The etymology of hair // is nest, from the Arabic...\" I might have expected the connection of Arabic coffee in Wild Fox and Hard Damage, but I could never have guessed I'd be able to connect \"Kalda the goat herder\" in Almontaser's \"Coffee Arabica as a Malestrom of Endless Aftershocks\" with Peter the goat herder in Heidi, which I am accidentally re-reading prior to adding to the Little Free Library in front of my house. (And the grandmamma in the city sends coffee to the grandmother on the mountain!)So many wonderful lines: \"I plant our spangled plotlines in tin canisters, tempt a flower to rocket out, offering myself as witness.\" (From \"Guide to Gardening Your Roots.\") And \"I imagine Allah as ever-shiting. As light / that keeps dazzling.\" (From \"Operation Restoring Hope.\") And the fox turns up again in \"After Running Away from Another Marriage Proposal\": \"The fox stands heavy over my heart, watching the vast, empty valley, bronzed by the yellow moon.\"I'll leave you with that, the yellow moon."},
{"title": "The Niagara River", "date": "Thursday, August 18, 2022", "text": "Any time I read a poem or bunch of poems by Kay Ryan, I am blown away. This bunch, in The Niagara River (Grove Press, 2005), tipped me over the edge in a barrel! The cover art, which I had been staring at for a couple years maybe, and thought was a photograph, is a painting by Frederic Edwin Church from 1857. Kay Ryan amazes me with her pithy truths and fabulous serious humor in short lines, short poems, each one hard and shiny as a crystal. The first/title poem is surreal and super real at once, part of the crystalline quality. Current events in my family wamily make me want to text \"Carrying a Ladder\" to my son. And suddenly, on p.4, I found the coincidence of sharks, in \"Sharks' Teeth.\" And teeth.The phrase \"quid pro crow\" in \"Felix Crow\" made me smile.The subtle and persistent internal rhyme also made me smile. As did the way she sees a bird on a beach. In \"Expectations,\" I am amazed at how an abstract and widely applicable title attaches to a specific dry creek bed waiting for rain. And how she turns the landscape voluptuously human in 10 short lines in \"Green Hills.\"Is \"Rubbing Lamps\" also an ars poetica? The poet describing     something     so odd and     filled with promise     for a minute     that you spend     your only wish     wishing someone else     could see it.And I think I am her \"Ideal Audience,\" a poet in the same room with her. \"The Past\" as a \"frozen lake..breaking up\" reminded me of the t-shirts for our family vacation: \"The past is a bucket of ashes.\" (Carl Sandburg) And \"Legerdemain\" made me look up the word \"legerdemain.\" There are poems that seem to be elegies and others that seem to be phiolsophy and poems that are dreams. A coincidence of Australopithicus. And a sad little lime of a poem at the end.Sad as it is, August is a good month."},
{"title": "Equilibrium", "date": "Wednesday, August 17, 2022", "text": "Equilibrium,by Tiana Clark (Bull City Press, 2016) is another winner of their Frost Place Chapbook Competition and another winner for me in the Sealey Challenge! A powerful book with powerful cover art by Amy Sherald. You can read \"Particle Fever,\" a poem from the book, and get the book, here at Bull City Press. I think I got it by ordering a bundle of their chapbooks, probably when researching the competition! The first/title poem is split down the page, showing a main split in her life and also her solution to it:Took me                                 thirty years to sayI'm glad                             I don't pass for white.First coincidence: sitting beside my  TV is a DVD I just brought home, with both versions (1934 and 1959) of the movie Imitation of Life. I think I wanted to see them to compare them to each other and to the film Passing, directed by Rebecca Hall, which we admire. Second coincidence: I was just learning that the teeth of a comb are probably called that because of the actual animal \"toothcomb,\" used for grooming. You can read about it here in Wikipedia, but I read about it in the book, The Tales Teeth Tell, by Tanya M. Smith, which something had led me to obtain via interlibrary loan. But in Equilibrium, I find those teeth in the poem \"Hair Relaxer: An Origin Story,\" about the split between wanting to straighten her hair and accepting its \"genetic bend of curls.\"Third coincidence is the color blue, running through so many of these books this August, here in the poem \"A Blue Note for Father's Day,\" as the speaker's white father is an absent one. And maybe there's another split running through all this, the body from the spirit, as with the beautiful Sarah, in the poem \"Exorcism,\" \"a girl with no father, a girl that / made God her father, a girl that wanted to be saved, / but mostly to be loved.\"New Orleans and New York City come passionately alive in two back to back poems in this book, one of them, \"Tell Me: Harlem,\" which begins, \"Every day, I walked over the ashes of Langston Hughes \" & his glittering cosmogram of ancient rivers....\"Then there's the heartbreaking \"Broken Ghazal for Walter Scott,\" with a Facebook \"video looping like a dirge on repeat\" of \"another black man dead, another fist in my throat.\" In \"Particle Fever,\" she evokes her own name via the \"hard consonant of T, / said with the Tip of the Tongue.\" In this one, she does name herself: \"But Tiana--// you have got to stop watching this video. Walter is gone & he is not your daddy, / another story will come to your feed, stay back.\"Emily Dickinson is invoked in \"Sandy Speaks,\" a poem that made me gasp at the end. And again, in \"How to Find the Center of a Circle,\" in the word \"circumference,\" though the epigraph is from Countee Cullen, and the subject matter is \"the first time // you are branded\"--unforgettable. All through the book, such a perfect ordering of poems!Fourth coincidence: I've been listening to Billie Holiday CDs, a compilation of Love Songs, recorded in the prime of her life, and her own favorite, Lady in Satin, with Ray Ellis and his orchestra, when her life and her voice were ravaged. Here in Equilibrium, I find in \"Waking in the Vanderbilt Psychiatric Hospital,\"     It does not matter what wild honey     drove me here for dark angels to sing:     I'm all Bessie, Billy, and Simone---     black pain swinging, sweet and low.Fifth coincidence is lace, here \"red lace, / endless red lace spills down the mountain / of memory.\" This lace is in part 3, Origin, of a long tour de force poem called \"Prometheia Remixed.\" In part 4, \"The Fire-Bringer,\" as a lover of myth and theatre, I am pulled in by the line, \"I wish I could have seen Paul Robeson play Othello---\" and then her imagination and writing let us see it, from her point of view:     I want to see him smother     a white woman     on stage every night and every night     after the play     make love to that same     pure milk he loved so much...Please do find the rest of this poem on your own, how it keeps shifting, and how it ends."},

It is its own thing altogether! A compelling chapbook by Kimberly Povloski (Driftwood Press, 2019) with compelling cover art by Alexander Landerman, that folds over onto the back cover, too. Interestingly, the book's title comes from another work of art, Hölle der Vögel, by Max Beckmann.The gray swirl of birds in Landerman's cover reminds me of a phrase I love in one of Povloski's poems: \"dark pearl of weather.\" Then a sad, moody poem called \"pearl\" begins, \"The summer your parents planted a wisteria tree it died.\" Then a coincidence, a short poem called \"painted bunting\" reminds me of Thoreau burning down the forest in O'Nights.     i could set fire     to these fields     i could burnThe book is about \"bird gods\" as much as birds, about saints and suffering. It ends with an interview with the poet about subject matter and process. I love her answer to the first question, about birds: \"They exist and thrive in human-engineered environments--in the cities and suburbs that have destroyed their natural habitats.\" That's something I learned on my first bird walk! How my own community is actually a haven for birds that would otherwise be displaced. Povloski goes on, \"That adaptability, that cunning, seems almost elemental. Birds-as-animal embody an extant wilderness in our daily lives. I think that's what makes birds-as-symbol so provocative.\"Yet another wonderful find in the Sealey Challenge this August!"},
{"title": "Rowing Inland", "date": "Monday, August 15, 2022", "text": "When I opened the book Rowing Inland, by Jim Daniels (Wayne State University Press, 2017) to the table of contents and saw a poem titled \"Wishbone,\" I knew it was the book for today, following yesterday's The Wishbone Dress. And there's the first coincidence!This is part of the Made in Michigan Writers Series, and I was eager to encounter some Pure Michigan (Yes, Michigan!--calling on various tourism slogans here...) as our family had annually spent a week together in Michigan for many summers, right up until this one, when we went to Nashville, TN (or just outside it, with redheaded woodpeckers, I am happy to report!), but this is not tourist Michigan. It is lived Michigan, with car factories, trailer parks, economic decline, smoking and drinking, streetlights (and streetlights out), and fireworks going off long past the 4th of July. The title poem and others have nostalgia in them, for lost childhood (and childhood friends), but it's a clear-eyed book, too, hard-hitting at times, with humor, light and dark.In \"Wishbone,\" we see the mother's windowsills with \"potted violets\" in tender light. \"My mother dried wishbones on those sills.\" That happened at my house, too. \"It was she who decided they were dry enough / to break. She never wished herself.\" My mother always gave the wishbones to her children. \"If you find my father / in this picture, please let me know.\" Now there's a particular sadness. His father worked nonstop in the factories...and left unfinished projects in the house, went on one vacation, or went fishing (that was not fishing).Yes, I found August: \"Outside, August waits.\" That's in a poem with no day job. And I also found Labor Day, waiting just around the corner. And August again in that same poem, \"Summer Weight, Labor Day\":     Anticipation is a dog that's already     been kicked. Sad September.     If only you could go back     to school and do it right this time,     or merely better.     Pencils sharpened by August heat.The poem continues with \"Lawn mowers on the prowl,\" and that reminded me to tell my husband, after his most recent mow, that already the first yellow leaves of the sweet gum were landing. And then, in the last stanza, the word \"Zoom\" leapt out in its current resonance before receding into the past and fading summer:     Zoom in on you sprawled on your porch     issuing lame challenges to insects and sunshine     to linger. Over a warm beer, you dream     of the perfect cool hat that could've     changed your life."},
{"title": "The Wishbone Dress", "date": "Sunday, August 14, 2022", "text": "In a terrible and ironic way, The Wishbone Dress, by Cassandra J. Bruner, is, again, the perfect book to read on a Sunday, given the presence of biblical quotations and a dubious pastor within. The Wishbone Dress, published by Bull City Press, was the winner of the 2019 Frost Place Chapbook Competition, and it is a stunning book, just like its excellent cover by Jennifer Thoreson, Flora 1, from her Flora series. My husband, a painter, loves this cover, seeing the cross in it. I also love the author photo, her hair, her choker, which, one of the poems tells me, can mask the Adam's apple. That inner narrative, of a boy named Reid, wracked by medical problems in his youth, who transforms into a woman, is told with the perfect mix of a mother's empathy and confusion in the poem, \"Demeter: The Poem As My Mother.\" Taking on her mother's voice, the poet/speaker, I am guessing, better understands her mother and, perhaps, herself. That the poet has chosen the name Cassandra 1) thrills me, as I identify with Cassandra, too! 2) is powerful and poignant, as the ekphrastic poem \"Object Lessons: After Solomon J. Solomon's Ajax and Cassandra\" shows us that painting. (Here, shown via photographic reproduction thanks to Wikipedia.) This poem, partly about the rape of Cassandra by Ajax in mythology, also tells the story of the rape of a girl in a parking lot--a story told by the dubious pastor:     The preacher stresses this point          as he reads newsclippings to rows               of children. Their silence thick as gauze          over a slit eye. A creature bent toward     her destruction he calls her. Just as Solomon          paints Cassandra--straining over Ajax               toward Athena's altar, rainbowed pinions          of light pressing her against her assailant.The preacher's \"point\" was to blame the victim with a detail of what she had been doing the moment before...as if to provoke/deserve the attack. We all know this old story, alas. And how powerful women are called witches, and burned. In \"Cora, Bound to the Tree, Delivers Her Testimony,\" Cora (the Witch) says:                                                                   Go          ahead. Puncture my ankles with an iron rod & call them     pillars of onyx when they refuse to shatter. Watch my          hair flash into steel ribbons under your blades.     Make a profane miracle of me---It's a beautiful and heartrending book. From \"Of the Night\":     We will kneel, unfurling     our perfumed nests of hair in offering.        Those who have been reading along in the blog re: Sealey Challenge connections will recognize the blue coincidence of \"blue ribbons of humiliation\" in \"Poem of My Shame.\" Along with myth and the Bible, there is also Nature--birds and prairie, heron and milkweed. From \"Apologia\":                                        Somewhere a goshawk     descends & a pair of women     dress themselves with wishbones in separate     roomsIn my separate room, reading of another woman's separate experience, I am connected, I am bound, I am wishing..."},
{"title": "O'Nights", "date": "Saturday, August 13, 2022", "text": "The wonderful title for this one, O'Nights, by Cecily Parks (Alice James Books, 2015), comes from a bit of dialogue quoted in Henry David Thoreau's journal, a Goodwin speaking, saying, after a bit of age guessing, re: Emerson vs Thoreau, \"But he has not been out o'nights as much as you have.\" On this gorgeous, breezy summer day, I was outside for most of it, and so was this book, and, I gather, so was the poet, while writing it! Are these eco-poems? Nature poems? Or \"postpastoral\" poems, as in the poem actually titled \"Postpastoral\"?      I borrowed an axe     so heavy I had to drag it     through the woods.This stanza from it reminds me of the movie we watched last night, Land, a Robin Wright project, recommended by a co-worker (a recommendation I heartily pass along to you!), even though the axe in the movie mostly stayed closer to home...in the wild.I love learning stuff in poems, and, in \"When I Was Thoreau at Night,\" I learned that \"Peregrine,\" a human as well as falcon name, means \"wanderer.\" In that same poem:                                                  Oh, yes,     I wanted the world to be wild again. I believed     I might hold weather in my hands     and mend it.That, and the opening poem, \"Hurricane Song,\" make me think that this is a book in tune with and in defense of the environment.Now let me tell you about the random coincidii and the many mentions of the moon! (Sun & Moon is the theme of the upcoming open mic at the public library, so the moon is on my mind, as is the caveat against the moon in poems, which always makes me so glad to find the moon there!!) The moon:     the moon said, You dream me (p. 3)     low-slung moons (p. 9)     the street's mechanical moon (p. 53)     Some nights I beg the moon / to swerve and hit me. (p. 66)The random coincidii:     \"I believe it's all this pollen that dizzies me.\" (It was a high-pollen count day in central Illinois today!)     Just yesterday I heard the first/only (?) ice cream truck in the neighborhood, and here's a poem titled \"Girls Ride Shotgun in the Ice Cream Truck.\"     Lots of blue in \"Blue Oat Grass Epithalamium\" (as is some previous books!)     I just read (outdoors!) in the current issue of Vanity Fair a reference to Virginia Woolf in the article about Joan Didion and Eve Babitz, and here in a Note at the end (p. 77), referring to the title of a particular poem (p. 5), \"The Swallow Dips Her Wings in Midnight Pools,\" is, of course, Virginia Woolf!     The book is published by Alice James Books, and there is a poem titled \"Alice James\" and a Note about William James. Er, more than coincidence?!     In a way, the poem \"Pilgrim\" confirmed my connection to the movie, Land:     Then I'm going to tell him how I lived     in the wild: I ran out of electricity     one autumn and camped outside,     sleeping by a stump whose rot     coincided with my idea of discipline.     ...                                    When I ran out     of conversation, I came inside and made amends     with my home, my socks, the length     of autumn. I doubted the winter     so fiercely that my electricity stayed lost,     I was going to practice being a pilgrim forever.     I was going to worship my head lamp     until its battery ran out. I thought better.I enjoyed this book. I did not know that Thoreau set fire to the forest. Yikes! I love how, in \"I Have Set Fire to the Forest,\" and other poems, she wears a dress on her walks in nature:                                                        If I were      Thoreau, Spring would make me want     to destroy something.LOVE that stanza break! And how the poem is quietly, insistently, erotic:                                       Like the pussy willows     I know I'll bloom eventually     and when I do, people will want to touch me."},
{"title": "Hard Damage", "date": "Friday, August 12, 2022", "text": "This one had poem after poem of gripping intensity and experience unlike my own, so I read it as if looking into a new world. Hard Damage by Aria Aber, winner of the Prairie Schooner Book Prize in Poetry and the Whiting Award (University of Nebraska Press, 2019). But it is my world--America with its covert actions elsewhere in the world (once her parents' homeland) and full of privilege (of which she and I both partake). And it isn't my world: it is refugee camp, Afghanistan left behind, and languages I don't know but deeply appreciate, as explored in these poems.Cover image: Moa, 1911, Leopold Museum, Vienna.Here in Hard Damage I find grenades compared to turtles and also \"grenade\" connected to pomegranate in etymology:                        Grenade, its shape     so much like the fruit they named it after,     pomegranate, from Latin pomum granatum     (apple with many seeds), something     I can harvest and pick from a tree--     a comfortable taste in my mouth, and yes,     fruit of the dead, or of fertility, depending     on whose sustenance to listen to.I find connections, of course, to the other books I've been reading here in August for the Sealey Challenge--for instance, a mention of the month of August itself, in the poem \"Foreign Policies,\" one that moves from and shifts back to the more personal poems in the book to the more political: \"August, too, was a mastermind, distracting me / toward your lima bean eyes.\"And the color blue: \"the blue uncertainty\" of \"Asylum\" in a refugee camp, and \"Rilke, blue prince of the lyric I, comes to me often.\" In \"Operation Cyclone,\" a father, \"his voice is blue shards of a dinner plate / atop a compost heap.\" In another part of that same long poem, a brother-uncle-son, lost, imagined in the section called \"Interrogation Chamber\": \"The blue light censoring his face.\" And the sentiment that might somehow save us all: \"If, despite relentless blue, despite snow, you dared to hold me / and I dared to be held\"Connections to Here, by C.S. Giscombe, in a way, to the idea of \"here,\" as in Aber's poem titled \"Here,\" \"We sip Arabic coffee and warm our faces / by the oven, which glares at us with its black snout.\" (Also, a poem that contains this fabulous simile: \"ice / falling from fir trees like books pushed off a shelf.\") And in the poem \"Alles/All,\" how \"there\" compares and contrasts to \"here,\" creating two kinds of place:\"From the back, in my car seat, I'd protest: No, AFGHANISTAN IS MORE BEAUTIFUL. IT HAS EVERYTHING THERE.You'd laugh, somewhat confounded: You have never been there.There: green macaws, AK 47s, feces in water pipies, schools in clay huts, tiny crocheted shoes, market men sitting on upside down crates, landmines, mud, an abundance of apples, pomegranates, watermelon, flies, mosquitoes, that little house behind the river--does it still exist?Here: You and I in a car, green fields of cattails, the summer night warblers gossiping, the sky lowering its clouds like marbled ham toward us.There: I love you, I love you.Here: All that there is.\"I find it remarkable that this poet so deeply remembers a world she can't really remember--too young, gone too long--through her relatives' memories, stories, and her own research. And creates it here so well! She loves and honors her mother, who spent time in prison for revolutionary action. In \"Lass/Let,\" one of the poems that examines meaning via a single word in German and in English, we learn:\"My mother let me happen to her. She let prison happen to her, simply because she believed in Women's Rights and Afghanistan as a sovereign state. She went to prison with her little sister, and she emerged.\" The story continues in the poem \"dir/You\": \"You, I said to my mother, have been to prison. But she cooked on in the kitchen, ignoring me. Or, she scratched and peeled the wallpaper, weeping....\"It's a beautiful book, with terrible things happening in it:\"the woman, 34, revolutionary socialist, killed by the mujahedeen, was found with her head in her lap: wearing an earring, red lipstick, a book of poems in her jacket\"Because it is a beautiful world, with terrible things happening in it."},

Brook Corfman, winner of the 2018 Rising Writer Prize (Autumn House Press, 2019). It's one I read outdoors on a beautiful afternoon and early evening, knowing I just needed to immerse myself in it and would not exactly understand but simply experience this identity journey with a wonderfully collagey feel. The Notes at the end mention some of my faves!: Sarah Ruhl, Emily Dickinson, Chekhov. Here are some lines I love: \"The shock of the person walking around when you realize: the person is you.\" \"Here's the space between two people, which is the same as the space between three, between four, between one.\"Somehow the cover image (by Sarah Walko) does that, too, the spacing magic.

{"title": "Thrall", "date": "Monday, August 8, 2022", "text": "That thing is happening, as it did last year, and probably in previous years of the Sealey Challenge, where I find I am reading poems in the month mentioned in the poem--that is, August. In \"Elegy,\" the very first poem in Thrall, by Natasha Trethewey (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2012), it is late August, and we are still in early August, but still... And other coincidences continue. Yesterday, I told you about finding my friend's pencilled notes in the book I was reading. Today, in \"Illumination,\" the last poem in Thrall, I find \"this secondhand book   full / of annotations   daring the margins in pencil.\"It's a beautiful elegy, by the way, for her father. It recounts a day fishing together, his \"defeat\" casting, his boots heavy with water, and her small success, the catch and release of two small trout. But a coincidence that stood out for me was her awareness of using him, in a way, for poetry, and how that connected to Diane Wakoski's commitment to poetry and complicated connection to family. Trethewey says,         I can tell you nowthat I tried to take it all in, record it   for an elegy I'd write--one day--when the time came. Your daughter,   I was that ruthless. What does it matterif I tell you I learned to be?Trethewey's \"Elegy\" is all love, despite the named ruthlessness, but the poems speak of other complications, notably the mixed-race marriage of which she is the product. Many poems in Thrall are about paintings that depict black and white mixings of family, painter's model, or even, in \"Miracle of the Black Leg,\" body and limb--\"black donor, white recipient\"--an astonishing thing/\"myth\" to consider. \"Taxonomy\" discusses, using the language of the past, \"mestiso,\" \"mulato,\" \"castiza.\" And the title poem, \"Thrall,\" is about Juan de Pareja, \"the slave of the artist Diego Valezquez,\" as the note at the end tells us, and an artist himself, as well as \"the mulatto son / of a slave womanas if    it took only my mother   to make me      a mulattomeaning      any white mancould be my fatherIn the touching poem \"Enlightenment,\" father and daughter discuss Thomas Jefferson over time, revising their understanding of him, his relationship to Sally Hemings, and each other. On a tour of Monticello, she teases her father:                                     This is where   we split up. I'll head around to the back.When he laughs, I know he's gratefulI've made a joke of it, this history   that links us--white father, black daughter--even as it renders us other to each other.As heartbreaking as the \"Elegy.\"And maybe I needed a little joke, too. Something made me pick up The Poet's House, by Jean Thompson, from the new shelf at the library today. Probably the title, right? After reading about Diane Wakoski's pettiness and jealousy yesterday in Greed, Parts 5-7, the epigraph made me laugh: \"...and thus cruelty, envy, revenge, avarice, and the passions purely evil, have never formed any portion of the popular imputations of the lives of poets.\" --Percy Bysshe Shelley, \"A Defence of Poetry.\" Mmhmm."},
{"title": "Greed, Parts 5-7", "date": "Sunday, August 7, 2022", "text": "This signed copy of Greed, Parts 5-7, by Diane Wakoski (Black Sparrow Press, 1971) comes from my friend Bill via his widow, Ellen. He has underlined parts in pencil and written a few marginal notes, so reading it is also reading what Bill found important, salient, about it. On page 11, the word \"greed\" is circled. A section beginning, \"What is that greed?\" is half-bracketed, with \"parenting\" written in the margin where Wakoski is suggesting the \"greed\" for \"repeating ourselves\" in children \"could make     these same people     produce beautiful objects     benevolent institutions     or write books and religions.But, usually, it doesn't. In this deeply confessional book she tells us she gave up her own children, in part because she was poor and had no husband and in part to pursue her poetry. She says we would understand if we gave up our sentimentality. And she likens our greed to sharks, at one point listing their beautiful names: \"when I start listing beautiful names / it is because my own pain is so deep.\"As this has been quite the summer of shark headlines, shark attacks, injuries, terrible wounds, I know I am reading it at the right time. Also, though yesterday's book by Shane McCrae, seemed right for a Sunday, it's fine to be immersed in one of the seven deadly sins instead. Also, like McCrae's book, Wakoski's is part of a larger, ongoing project, with other books devoted to (other parts of) greed.Part 6, about Jealousy, adds leeches to the water creatures in the book. It is so confessional, she writes it mainly as a \"Dear Diary\" entry, and it explains \"how goodness, or the desire for it drives us mad.\" Also pertinent to Sunday, but irreverent to some, she says, \"I am very melodramatic. I see myself hanging on a cross...\" and confesses her petty jealousies, meanness, nastiness, and hypocrisy, mainly toward other poets when they get what she wanted. It's pretty shocking! Bracketed by Bill:     A good man is one who sees no cause for bitterness in this. Who does not find himself demeaned or hurt by such things. But what is it that protects him, keeps him whole, gives him transfusions of plasma to replace his evaportaing blood?     Perhaps faith in himself? A belief that art or love or anything valuable and beautiful is beyond the temporal?Yes, I would guess that's it, and in Part 7, Self-Righteousness, she blames her mother for knocking her down, jealously, for any accomplishment, with the warning, \"Pride goeth before a fall.\" And she brings the Lion Fish, a poisonous, spiky, threatening but \"magnificent creature\" into the already dangerous waters of life. Wakoski continues her astonishingly honest self-critique and rescues Pride in this section--distinguishing the deadly sin aspect from the pick-yourself-back-up-and-survive aspect. She knows she tried to be a good girl growing up, and how it hurt her:     Oh you false teacher,     letting me think if I were honest     and clean and straight,     the world would just be all right,     and that if it weren't I could sit righteously     in my chair of innocence and look back     at it     and somehow triumph.     But the world only admits it is wrong,     when you make it admit it is wrong;     and where is the poetry in that?And have you ever felt like her in this?:     My angers come from having lived as I was taught     and not feeling the world honors or     rewards me for any of my decency.But the Lion Fishy response of self-righteousness cannot be the answer [as bracketed by Bill]:     the greedy thought that when you are right     you can burn others for their wrongness;     it is a fire that could destroy     the world.If you are fascinated by Diane Wakoski, you may enjoy the work of filmmaker Jesseca Ynez Simmons, interviewed here at Escape Into Life, and her film Emerald Ice, in which Wakoski appears, discussed here, with a teaser. And now I am going to try to be a better person."},

Not that these gripping, wise, clear-eyed, unflinching, masterful poems would put me to sleep. No, but they greeted my wakened self when most needed to re-direct my jam-packed mind in the wee hours. The cover is Portrait of a Woman (c. 1480) by Hans Memling. The title, The Woman Who Died in Her Sleep, found again as the title of the last poem in the book, refers to a photograph by Jeffrey Silverthorne. The amazing poet is Linda Gregerson. I'm glad I didn't die in my sleep, last night, but, otherwise, it might be the best way to go...These poems look at the world, the body, the individual, the wars of the time (1990s), the personal difficulties, the global woes, the fleeting joys. \"For the Taking\" is a devastatingly honest poem (that reminds me of Yvonne Zipter's poem, \"Daddy,\" from yesterday's reading) about a sister whose \"bad uncle\" abused her, from eight-and-a-half years old on, \"for years, in the back of the car,in the basement where he kept his guns,          and we     who could have saved her,...                     ...we would be somewhere mowing the lawnor basting the spareribs, right          outside, and--how     many times have you heard this?--wewere deaf and blind                         and have     ever since required of her that shetake care of us, and she has,                          and here's     the worst, she does it for love.\"Salt\" shows us a botched suicide in a barn and a broken collarbone in a hammock. But \"With Emma at the Ladies-Only Swimming Pond on Hampstead Heath\" gives us the surprise of a pond in the woods, and, as the title promises, ladies swimming, safely, alone. \"Target\" returns us to fears for the safety of our children, via Medea, car crashes, the Serbian war. \"Fish Dying on the Third Floor at Barneys,\" at first about a dramatic department store fashion display, compares the dying fish to a dying father. \"Bleedthrough\" compares menstruation to art, as when, in a painting, \"we say // that the surfeited pigment 'bleeds.'\" And \"Luke 17:32\" reminds us of Lot's wife and \"the rigors of the backward look.\" How do we start over?!

But I think the patience of metal might be how hot it can get waiting to be what it really is.     And I am white hot,     malleable,     aching     for a smithy,     the careful taps and blows     that leave me ringing...I can't believe I hadn't read this book until now, as I am an admirer (and previous reviewer) of Zipter's work. True, in 1990, when it was published, I was busy having a baby. And I love the poems about various children in the \"Learning to Dare\" section of this book. So much joy and hope. Elsewhere, there is so much loss and grief, and a devastating \"Daddy\" poem of early trauma. And such beautiful poems about the death of a beloved mother.

This is a tradition     among women: oral history.     So much irreplaceable     has been lost.What has been lost is somehow found in the poem \"That Much,\" a happy memory that might be mostly imagined, a \"frozen moment that most likely / never happened.          ...We are smiling, silent     except for love. That much     is real.And, speaking of reality, Zipter's poem \"Reality\" is a wonderfully prescient and pertinent philosophical ramble on it: \"Reality / is as hard to pin down as a politician / or an angry kid.\"I love this book, and love reading it late, as I know the newfound love, patiently waited for, was real, has lasted, has lived many anniversaries beyond its charming, goofy one-year \"Anniversary Waltz.\" And I love how the last poem, \"Loss,\" turns about to be a funny, sweet poem not really about loss!     I don't want to lose you, I whisper.     \"Like at the mall?\" you say,     infusing the dark with light.     Yes, at the mall.I'll leave the rest for you to find."},

Such a lovely book, winner of the Frost Place Chapbook Competition, it's about the mother-child relationship from infancy into early childhood--the peaceful, gentle, exhausted, fear-and-love-filled time of bonding, getting the child to eat and sleep--that slips away from memory, so much about the present moment, unless captured or recreated in language, \"the mommy-memoirs\" of baby notes or, here, poems. The little details stick out--\"red pajama top with the train\"--and remind me of my own baby notes.Of course, this mother is a reader--desperate to read a book again--and a writer--patient with herself from necessity--and happy to read books to her boy. And, if she can't get enough sleep, she can enjoy Dorothy falling asleep in the poppies of The Wizard of Oz, and \"popcorn all over the rug.\" One's life is taken over until a small moment to reflect: \"I was a bubble, a greenhouse, a lens...\" from \"After Dropping My Son Off at Preschool,\" \"self being a place encompassing a small boy.\" And \"the greenhouse encompassing three things: a mother, a gingko tree, a boy.\" In this poem, she Googles something, maybe. The gingko tree. In \"Baby/Honey,\" the Internet helps her understand why you don't give a honey to a child under one. And in my blog, we celebrate coincidence--how yesterday's idiot was a man, and today's was a woman, both of them wise in their folly. Stonestreet: \"It is a luxury and a privilege to be such an idiot.\" And \"Charge,\" the giant poem, will break your heart."},
{"title": "Guilty Prayer", "date": "Monday, August 1, 2022", "text": "Steve Henn is reading for the library in September, so I am starting off the Sealey Challenge with two of his chapbooks from Main Street Rag: Guilty Prayer (2021) and American Male (2022). Don't worry, the latter is more a critique of \"toxic masculinity\" than any kind of celebration. I do hope I can keep up with the Sealey Challenge, and read a book of poems a day in August, but I am in a busy time of life, just off a week-long family gathering, just starting a board presidency, and re-situating myself, so we'll see! I have certainly enjoyed the Sealey Challenge in the past, and love the chance to read poetry sitting in a lawn chair in the back yard. Aha! I am already quoting from \"American Male,\" making it a Random Coinciday, as well as a Poetry Someday in the blog:     Isn't it true I'd rather sit out back     in a cheap lawn chair reading poems     than do the edge trimming     or admire a full wall display     of oppressively shiny tools?So Steve Henn is exactly the right guy to start off with, and I've got to love a man who asks the question, \"Why / do I always feel a surge of anxiety / stepping into a hardware store?\" Meanwhile, guys are using power saws in the back yard that backs up to mine, and my husband is using one intermittently in the garage, so the plan may change and, since the heat has arrived, involve a ceiling fan.Also, again from American Male, I've got to love a guy that starts a poem (\"Hail Mary,\" after Frank O'Hara and for Anne Henn), \"Mothers of America! / Take your boys to the library!\" These poems are honest, bold, tender, and sad. They contain grief, suicide, treatment for mental illness, alcoholism, sobriety, teenagers, high school classrooms, dear, dear friends, and real, deep questions. Here's one, from \"Columbia, Misery\" in Guilty Prayer; \"What is it the addicted are really addicted to?\" and the possible, quite reasonable answer: \"Feeling better?\" Along with the confusing reality: \"If I felt okay continuously / I wouldn't know how to take it.\" And here's another, related, question, this one from \"It Goes All the Way Back to 7th Grade\" in American Male: \"what kind of deluded perfectionist thinks / he has a right to feel good all the time?\" I am that kind, or have been. What am I now? These are the kinds of poems that encourage you to ask...Henn's poems challenge us to face, and stop, gun violence. In \"Role-Playing Games,\" in Guilty Prayer, we live through/imagine school trainings, for adults and kids, and it's awful. \"Admit / that this is what we have become.\" But on the very next page, \"In the classroom,\" we are reading a poem by Ada Limon, in touching togetherness--literally touching, one boy touching another on the arm \"in a gesture of comfort.\" So lovely to see! Guilty Prayer is \"for Zeb\"--a good friend who appears in several poems--and \"in memory of Lydia F. Henn, 1980-2013, American artist\" and the mother of the poet's children, the terrible loss, the grief we feel throughout. A suffering that provokes compassion and care. I'm glad we get to see those kids growing up loved and feeling safe, as safe as anyone can feel/be these days, with their dad. And I'm glad their dad, in American Male, has a sense of humor as well as a sense of responsibility, so he'll help them get through. Enough of a sense of humor to say, about himself:     because isn't it just like a man to require     reassurance when pretty much the only problem is     he's being an idiot?Yep, gotta love him. Can't wait to hear him read."},
{"title": "Bolero in My Head", "date": "Sunday, July 17, 2022", "text": "You know Bolero by Maurice Ravel? It's an orchestral piece with lots of repetition and a glorious build, so when it gets stuck in your head, it gets really stuck! I have been listening to it while directing a one-act play for Heartland Theatre, Running Uphill to Smooth Criminal, by E.K. Doolin, which, as you might guess, also references \"Smooth Criminal,\" a Michael Jackson song! The play, about a woman's nervous breakdown as her entrance into middle age, is delightful, and the playwright was delighted with our enhanced staged reading of it on Friday night! Today, the Sunday matinee, is the closing performance, but I think Bolero will stay in my head for a while! Pictured is Ida Rubenstein, who commissed the piece as a ballet for her to perform, and whose flowy attire inspired some of our costuming!Whenever I am acting or directing, my poetry writing and submitting gets set aside for a bit, but 1) I imagine it will resume soon 2) I have been writing goofy little quatrains in response to Shakespearean sonnets in the meantime. Part of a pleasant email sharing thingey.And, despite and sort of side by side with my Marie Kondo cleaning, which included the recycling, donating, and, alas, necessary trashing of many books, I am steadily reading. Sometimes simultaneously, fiction downstairs and nonfiction upstairs, or vice versa. My simultaneous reading often produces some fascinating correspondences, making it a Random Coinciday in the blog! I read Bastard Out of Carolina, by Dorothy Allison, side by side with Mermaid by Eileen Cronin, one a novel and the other a memoir, but linked via first-person narration and marvelous honesty and frankness. And, in comparing the novel's plot with Allison's own early life, one might find memoirish connections, as well. I found Cronin's book on the library display table on behalf of MarcFirst, books by and about people with disabilities. Cronin was born with partial legs and tells us about her childhood \"squiddling\" for locomotion, learning to live with artificial limbs, and tracking the mystery of why she was born that way, a story she tells while also showing that disability was not actually the main focus of her life. Living was, and is!Now I am reading books that go together very well: Uncomfortable Conversations With a Black Man, by Emmanuel Acho, and Horse, by Geraldine Brooks. Acho is educating me on racism, implicit bias, and how and why to have these important conversations. He has a video series on this, but, as I am a reader, this is the perfect way for me to listen to his points! I recommend it to all, and love his further recommendations for reading and viewing within chapters.Horse is about an actual horse, a painting of it, and about racism and race relations through time--as the horse is raised and trained in the 1850s in the South, the painting is re- discovered in 1950s America, and the horse research continues in the 2000s. The book is by a white woman and contains main characters who are Black, so there has been some controversy, but I am glad to see that Brooks uses the term \"enslaved\" (not \"slave\"), as Acho advocates, to show that no one is really born a slave as a human attribute but is instead enslaved by the people in power."},
{"title": "Shoes I Forgot", "date": "Sunday, July 3, 2022", "text": "Recently, while tidying up and moving summer clothes into drawer and closet, I came across a shoebox of  navy blue Keds. Yay! But wha--?! Where had these come from? I did not remember buying them in a shoestore, ordering them on Amazon, or receiving them from a friend, so it was time for 1) a memory check and 2) that Marie Kondo book, which conveniently turned up on the free cart at the library, because it was a fad a while back when I found the fad a little annoying. I was wrong.The memory check uncovered a feeling that I did have some navy blue shoes beyond the slip-ons that are fraying because I wore them so much and have now become the shoes I wear to the pool for Early Bird Lap Swim weekday mornings. It also uncovered a moment with my mom, finding them in her closet (but when?) and saying, \"These are nice!\" and her saying, \"Do you want them?\" and me wondering why she didn't...but respecting her offer of the gift. (Shoestrings? A tightness?) They fit me fine, and I like them, and now wear them with blue outfits to walk to work.But the life-changing magic of tidying up, as a title and an activity, is delightful. I read it to the end, doing little bits (which Marie Kondo might shake her head at, advocating a big bunch of work all at once) as I went, and the sort-of spiritual aspect of it, at the end, rang true. I do feel lighter and freer any time I truly get my house in order, and will do the whole thing now, though at my own pace, this summer. Her order of discarding is clothes (done!), books, papers, and miscellany.Yesterday was books. As you can imagine, 1) I have a lot 2) I am exhausted. But now 1) rested and 2) lighter! I finally discarded many literature textbooks that I can't donate anywhere (no one wants textbooks, especially outdated ones) that I had been saving for sentimental reasons (notes inside + I taught from them) and because I wanted to be able to locate again a particular short story or essay. Surely, I can find most things somewhere, yes?! Internet, library. I recycled many paperbacks and created a bag of library-worthy donations. I put some things in the Little Free Library in front of my house. I now have room on my shelves for other books! Wait, that might not be the Marie Kondo goal! Fear not. These other books are already here, in various stacks, and will go onto the shelves when I have finished reading them and/or sorting them by type. It was fun to rearrange by size and type, and to re-alphabetize where needed. And to dust.Today, by contrast, will be a Slattern Day--a walk to church, some time in the garden (or reading outdoors), a card game with my folks, and a cookout today because it might rain tomorrow. Happy 4th of July! I feel free!--though not in all ways...but I found support and comfort with that (the recent Supreme Court ruling/s) yesterday, thanks to a Zoom workshop with women, hosted by poet cin salach, Our Hearts Cannot Be Overturned.And putting my house in order also meant checking my poetry submissions, to find that my February 2021 submission to the New Yorker is now \"In Progress\" at Submittable. Maybe they are putting their house in order, too. Shall I expect a rejection soon? Meanwhile, my dad wants the Kondo book next, and so does my friend, Kim. They know each other; they can fight over share it."},
{"title": "Postcards to the World", "date": "Sunday, June 26, 2022", "text": "I have a new chapbook out, inside the current issue of Poetry East! I found many copies packed in a box on my doorstep yesterday when I got home from an afternoon rehearsal. It had rained all morning, and I was canvassing for a county board candidate in the rain, but the sun had come out, and there was a lovely breeze, and the day was gorgeous. A lovely surprise then to find my Postcards to the World delivered! This is an assemblage of my chalkboard poems, literally written in chalk on a green chalkboard and posted on Instagram and Facebook at various times for comfort, commiseration, or cheer during the pandemic. Richard Jones, poet and editor, after enjoying my tiny poems over time, approached me about publishing them all together in Poetry East, where he, too, was seeking comfort and cheer. The last issue was \"The Optimist,\" a rare thing these days, right? Sigh... I did need some joy, that's for sure. Rough, dark days lately in the USA, with more trouble to come, but also much hope. The January 6 hearings are laying out the facts about the insurrection. Biden signed the bipartisan gun bill into law. The range of responses to the overturning of Roe v. Wade show where we are and some paths forward. As several have said, we need to vote--here in Illinois on Tuesday, in a primary, and again on November 8, for people who will preserve democracy, not tear it down.In the morning, passing through the Farmer's Market on the way to the Democratic Party headquarters, to pick up canvassing materials, I ran into two high school pals, here for an informal \"Medicare Reunion.\" I am aware that they are probably not Democrats, and I was wearing my Democrats shirt. I'm sure they all had fun being (sort of) old and (mostly) Republican together! I've see the pictures on Facebook! Yay! I also felt (acutely) old later in the day, attending the 50th anniversary of high school summer theatre in the area, as I was in the very first season, as Marian the Librarian in The Music Man! The Mayor was there, various alums, and the cast of the current high school summer theatre production of Grease, cancelled for that night due to thunderstorms on the radar (which came at 9:11, as I was driving home from yet another meeting--what a busy day!), but the anniversary picnic event went off without a hitch, with unexpected but very pleasant bagpipes in the background, underscoring the theme of odd ambient soundtracks when you do outdoor theatre.I'm delighted by the appearance of the chapbook in this form, as I never want to erase what's currently on the green chalkboard, the \"welcome to our wedding\" message drawn by Natalie, maid of honor and graphic artist, and set up at the \"entrance\" to the outdoor ceremony at my daughter's wedding in May. That arbor is still up, by the way, and still adorned with garlands from this box in the background (like bagpipes) against which the chalkboard is currently propped. Someday, maybe, we'll take it down. Or maybe something else lovely will happen there."},

I guess I got a little too busy over the last month, getting my daughter married (yay! in my parents' back yard, at an arbor built by my husband, with bridal and bridesmaids' bouquets made by me!) and taking care of my parents' various health issues. Sigh... But all is well, and, as usual, I have been reading, my other kind of down time. I read This Time for Me, a memoir by Alexandra Billings, a performer I had seen in Chicago. You may know her from the series Transparent. What an interesting woman! And, in the Random Coincidays of my life, I read a time travel novel, This Time Tomorrow, by Emma Straub, that was sort of a cross between Groundhog Day and About Time.I read a book of poems, book of short stories, and finally finished a novel that had sat on my coffee table with a bookmark halfway through it for maybe...a year? It was finally the right time to finish it. But my favorite reading lately has been The Book of Eels, nonfiction about...yes, eels. Fascinating creatures, about which we finally know a few things, but which remain mysterious. They are all born in the Sargasso Sea and then swim/drift elsewhere.I have also been writing--a variety of things, including a script I got to see performed last night at the History Makers Gala, honoring 4 wonderful people in our community! My poetry feels on standby, but I do remember writing some, sending some out,* and storing some in the weird, dusty drawers of my mind. Sometimes, when I am waiting for something to come out**, everything feels on hold for a while. I just checked the mail. It isn't here yet, but it's still very, very hot out there. The poor mail carrier! And I do fondly remember Wide Sargasso Sea, by Jean Rhys, included on this Random Coinciday, you know why!*so far, only rejections...but nice ones!**something not rejected!"},
{"title": "Bird Walk", "date": "Sunday, May 15, 2022", "text": "A further coincidence of pigeons occurred in my reading on p. 113 of The Comforters by Muriel Spark: \"Soon a pigeon flashed out from its high loft and descended to the seat beside her. She folded the thin paper into a tiny pellet, fixed it into the band on the silver bird's leg, stroked its bill with her brown fingers, and let it go. Off it flew, in the direction of Ladle Sands.\"Speaking of pellets, I went on bird walk today, and while we did not see the great horned owl in Ewing Park, we did 1) hear its call and 2) see its pellet the under its tree, containing a mouse skull, fur, and feathers. Our fearless leader, Given Harper of the local branch of the Audubon Society, held the pellet in his hands for us. We also saw a bald eagle flying (gliding) high above and far away, heard flycatcher and titmouse, and saw a migrating pair of black-billed cuckoos (I saw one in motion; others saw the pair in binoculars on branches). An early-morning birder had seen a kite. We saw a different kind of kite stuck in a tree, and plenty of broad winged hawks.Earlier, as we walked through Hidden Creek nature preserve, truly \"hidden\" in town, in a residential neighborhood and just off the hiking trail, we saw an indigo bunting (vivid blue), Eastern pee wee (olive breast), and Eastern screech owl, red head poking boldly out of its screech owl box to observe us. I was mesmerized. As we walked, we passed a bench with yellow fabric roses tied to it, and a plaque. It was for Bill Morgan, my friend who died this spring. I sat down and put my arm around him, sort of. Lovely, lovely day. Bill would have enjoyed it, too.Speaking of coincidences, Ali Smith introduced this particular edition (pictured at left) of The Comforters, and I just read How to Be Both, by Ali Smith, in the St. Lucia eyes-on-a-stem edition (pictured above). I love reading, and now I love birding. Both! Neither of these covers is the edition I am reading. The other coincidence is plot. The Comforters, written in 1955 and published in 1957, has a metafictional component, where a character is hearing voices and a typewriter tapping and realizes she's a fictional character in a novel. Just like Stranger Than Fiction, a movie I love with Emma Thompson, Will Ferrell, Dustin Hoffman, and Queen Latifah! I can't wait to see what happens!"},

Likewise, the white anemone, just now showing its buds. The wild columbine is all that salmon and yellow color. I also have some dark purple columbine blooming in a side yard, and more columbine on the way, plus the large yellow columbine that will bloom later. Waiting for the blue spiderwort now...Busy times in my body and brain. Attended the funeral of a young co-worker yesterday. Heartbreaking. I loved learning about, and hearing, the country music songs she loved. In the afternoon, I helped to pot tree seedlings to be planted in the fall. Part of a big tree-planting surge: 11,000 seedlings (stick stage) were planted this spring. These that have budded and begun to leaf need to wait for the fall. Hot, fun work, in good company, outdoors.Then, there was a Zoom discussion of Book VII of Paradise Lost with an international bunch of people--mostly Chicago and Canada, but some were actually in Portugal for earlier Books, and some were walking El Camino in Spain while we were between Books. Here is a yellow lightbulb bee guarding the columbine, like 1) Rafael warning Adam not to disobey or 2) an angelic guard at the gate of Eden, alas.Working on scripts with deadlines and wedding details with meetings with vendors, parking signs, et cetera. Need to take my mother shopping for a dress, but also need to keep track of various medical details for both parents. This morning I need to go get and then put up posters for the summer 10-minute play festival at Heartland Theatre, where both my parents used to act and volunteer (board, committee). Duty + nostalgia.Last night, cool and pleasant respite at the Next to Normal Story Slam, resumed after 2 years gone in the pandemic.

{"title": "A Coincidence of Pigeons", "date": "Sunday, May 8, 2022", "text": "The collective noun for a group of pigeons is basically \"a flock of pigeons\" or, in professional breeding circles, \"a kit (or kitte) of pigeons,\" but for my reading-and-blog purposes, it shall be \"a coincidence of pigeons,\" making it a Random Coinciday in the blog!I've read a lot of books over these past couple of years (and past couple of Covid weeks), but, coincidentally, I just read two novels with pigeons in them: Dr. Bird's Advice for Sad Poets, by Evan Roskos, and Cher Ami and Major Whittlesey, by Kathleen Rooney. I had acquired Cher Ami quite some time ago, and it waited patiently in a to-read stack on my coffee table for the exact right moment to be read, and that moment came during my isolation week. In 2018, at the 100th anniversary of World War I, the Great War, the war to end all wars, I immersed myself in lots of WWI reading and movie-viewing, sort of curating a WWI film festival for the library. So I was well aware of the famous carrier pigeon, Cher Ami, and how she saved the Lost Battalion. And also how she was misunderstood as a \"he.\" Hence, the male version of her French name. Kathleen Rooney develops all this so beautifully in Cher Ami and Major Whittlesey, also giving us a full look at the major who led his men into the Argonne Forest, following orders, and doing it brilliantly and efficiently, thus, accidentally, leading many of them to their deaths or maiming. Alas! Part of the charm of this book is that the chapters alternate in point of view, between the pigeon and the major. It was easy to believe in the way pigeons might \"think,\" how their homing instinct might work, and how consciousness continues--especially if you are taxidermied and live on in the Smithsonian Institution. So probably Cher Ami pre-disposed me to pick up Dr. Bird's Advice to Sad Poets, to find out what a real pigeon/imaginary therapist might \"say\" to a depressed high school boy. Also, sometimes I am a sad poet myself. And I do love this book's cover (see above; at hand is the movie cover). I am glad that the boy also gets a human therapist. I watched a lot of movies over the past few years, but only today did I realize that Dr. Bird was released as a movie in 2021. (You can watch it on Hulu. But I can't.) I liked how the humor in this book ran gently under the depression and family dysfunction, and I loved Dr. Bird!Here in real life, the sun has come out! I am clearing out gardens, looking at the pink and white bleeding heart and dark lilacs, and birdwatching. Coincidentally, my parents have actual nesting doves at their house!"},

Despite relentless masking and a double booster, I did test positive (home test), and am in my isolation week before resuming my life in the community. Still writing a poem a day for April, National Poetry Month, and that, too, will slip away...on Sunday, right? May Day is coming.On my first day of very mild illness, it was 80 degrees outside, and I rested on the glider, wrapped in a comforter, reading, journals at hand for any random poems or diary thoughts. A strong southerly wind blew over me. Out in the yard, my husband, mostly recovered from his own lost week, picked up sweetgum seedpods in the yard. Then it turned chilly for a while...And now, suddenly, violets are blooming everywhere in the grass! The yellow tulips are fully blown, and the pink just beginning. My dark lilacs are also beginning their fragrant opening. Lily of the valley and hosta are spiking up in their distinctive curls! A little of the two-toned hosta has uncurled, green and white. And where are my celandine poppies? Did they not return this year?

The week ahead looms risky, with a medicalprocedure for my dad on Wednesday, various meetings I prepared for in advance,so I wouldn’t forget, and which I fear, nonetheless, I might forget or feelunprepared for. Is this all part of the atmosphere when spring comes? I thinkmaybe yes. And/or that continuing suspension of time that I felt/feel duringthe pandemic? Is it a natural part of the aging process? I do, relentlessly,write everything down now in list form, so I can check it off—but it’s not justthe satisfaction of checking things off, getting things done, it’s also theneed to remember to do the things at all.

My library doesn't have that...in actual books (plenty of e-book versions)...which I prefer, so I have requested Flights through interlibrary loan.

{"title": "Mardi Gras Lost", "date": "Saturday, March 5, 2022", "text": "I fully intended to write a blog post for Fat Tuesday, since Fat Tuesday is an actual category here in my blog, one of the \"eight days a week\" on which I am (supposed to be) writing. Since I am not, and since I missed Mardi Gras, it is instead a Slattern Day...and, I suspect, will turn out to be a Random Coinciday and a Poetry Someday.Indeed, I notice this random coincidence in my current reading: a cormorant, a kind of black and white aquatic bird. Satan, a shape shifter, sits in the Tree of Life as a cormorant to observe Paradise in Book IV of Paradise Lost, by John Milton. That was a surprise,* as we usually picture him as a serpent. Perhaps that's in Book V. So far, he has also sat \"[s]quat like a toad, close at the ear of Eve,\" trying to invade her dreams. He is surely up to no good.*a surprise, even though I have read this book before...but it was decades ago, in college... Now I am re-reading it for a Zoom book group.But, back to the coincidence. I am also reading The Colour, by Rose Tremain, about gold** digging in New Zealand, and on p. 212, in the point of view of the character Pare, is this: \"She heard a cormorant shrieking in her dreams.\" I hardly ever read about cormorants, but here are two in the same week. Plus, the bad dreams...I didn't even eat a devilish sweet on Mardi Gras. Instead I am eating Harry & David pears,** a naturally sweet gift from my son and his girlfriend for my recent birthday. The pears, ripening gradually, are so delicious! Ah, perhaps they will make their way, plum-like, into a poem soon, as I am writing a poem a day, for Lent, with 40 Days, 40 Writes.**One was wrapped in gold!And I did submit some poems, by the deadline, yesterday, to a magazine I admire. Yesterday was also the \"deadline,\" as in \"best by\" date, on that blueberry goat cheese sitting in the fridge since Christmas, slattern that I am. Why? I loved that cheese! Why didn't I eat it on time? I had my reasons, but still. And, hey, it's cheese, it's probably still good, but also probably not something I want to take a chance on. Sigh...So here, instead of blueberry goat cheese, is a beautiful cormorant, by JJ Harrison, thanks to Wikipedia. See that random coincidence of the serpentine neck?!"},
{"title": "Back On", "date": "Saturday, February 26, 2022", "text": "Now that the play is over, my wedding ring is back on! So, in a way, is my former life. This weekend, I'll be doing laundry, visiting my parents, and mapping out March, April, and May. Many writing, editing, programming, and wedding-preparation tasks await! This past week has been a lovely transition, as we housed a playwright, visiting to rehearse and see performed a staged reading of her play. The grant-funded playwright-supportive program is called The Play's the Thing, and this play, by Lisa Dillman, is titled No Such Thing, a lovely coincidence, making it a Random Coinciday in the blog! A further coincidence was a reference in No Such Thing to two pretty rare first names--Bathsheba and Penelope--that were also character names in Life Sucks, the play I just finished (as Babs/Bathsheba) and the woman who played Penelope was in the audience. We laughed and hugged about that! Masked.*In the \"back on\" of my poetry life, I have 1) submitted some poems 2) researched and prepared some other submissions, and 3) looked again at a chapbook manuscript I will probably submit in March. Everything feels slow...but at exactly the right pace. Meanwhile, the poetry notebook continues to fill up with drafts, including a recent one based on a nightmare (morning mare) that I call \"Scary America\" in my mind (and in the notebook) but which I realize was premonitory, as in one day in advance of Putin's actual attack on Ukraine, which had been looming darkly in my brain as well as the news. The dream was like a juxtposition of the June 6 insurrection in the USA if it had continued into an overthrow of our government + the Russia/Ukraine situation. I feel further and weirdly connected, as my Life Sucks character Babs was of Ukrainian ancestry. Random Coinciday continues.*But here in Illinois, the state mandate expires as of February 28, and many places will become \"mask optional,\" with businesses and organizations still able to continue stricter guidelines if they want. One thing I can resume, post-theatre obligations, is seeing my husband's volleyball girls play...but it will be February 28, among the unmasked...and the schools have already been mask optional for a week or so.My transition to my former life being \"back on\" is very leisurely, as I notice my jammies are still on...and that's OK with me."},

For three weeks here in Febrary, including, alas, Valentine's Day, I am not wearing it. Nothing is wrong with my marriage! I just play an unmarried woman in Life Sucks and don't want to lose it in the dressing room, so it's safe in my (costume*) jewelry box at home for now. Here, you see it posed on a beautiful mosaic plant table (created by my friend Kim of Got Bliss?!) under the newly-blooming again Christmas cactus, now apparently a Valentine cactus!*I say costume jewelry to ward off thieves. I am not a fancy lady and do not have real jewels. Those are in the movies. The jewel thief movies!The play continues to be fun, with warm, receptive, lively, laughing audiences. I love this play, and the people in it and who worked on it in all kinds of ways, and it's clear that the audiences are delighted and moved by it. I'm glad we got the all the obstacles--Covid, masks, snow--to get it out there in the world.For Valentine's Day, I will be getting the required weekly Covid test and going to the dentist. My husband will be coaching sixth-grade volleyball. I hope you all have fun plans, too!"},
{"title": "Scary but Fun!", "date": "Sunday, February 6, 2022", "text": "Well, that was scary! But also lots of fun. We opened the play, Life Sucks, by Aaron Posner, on Friday night, coming together in the theatre for the first time in front of an audience after two snow days off. It was a sweet, supportive audience--a combination of the Friday night reservations and the cancelled pay-what-you-can preview performance audience from Thursday. I was probably well prepared to do this by having been in the Free Shakespeare Company in Chicago in the 1980s, where we memorized our lines on our own and came together as actors for the first time in front of the audience to do the whole play together. Last night, Saturday night, was our Sponsor Night, with the entire audience invited to a reception afterwards in a wonderful banquet room decorated for Valentine's Day. Life Sucks (like Uncle Vanya) is about \"love and longing,\" and this February time slot, though accidental, is perfect. The audience was masked (!), vaccinated (or recently tested) responsive, ready to laugh, and had a really good time. So did we! We have two more weekends of the show, and I am hoping for a February thaw, which often happens, to make it easier for everyone to get to the theatre!My parents, who live out in the country, have been snowed in for days. They finally got plowed out yesterday, but overnight their long drive drifted a bit again, thanks to the wind across the fields, and they will need another scooping. Fortunately, they live in a cozy farmhouse with a generator and lots of food in the cupboards! They didn't have to go to the grocery store...and face those empty (anyway) shelves!Somehow, my poetry life and my editing life have continued underneath the heaped snow and play nerves. Drafts appear in my poetry notebook, as if I put them there. (I did.) Rejections come by email, or I figure out that I wasn't notified by seeing contest winners posted on a website, etc. Over at Escape Into Life, I edited and posted the new Music for Music column by Dan Ursini, a Chicago writer and musian (and playwright!), about the artist Heirloome--a wonderful discovery. I love their \"between-worlds\" music, ethereal sound and visuals...!I realized during yoga, as no doubt I haverealized before, that my double mind can accommodate many things. Rodney Yeetells me what to do, and I do it, with full commitment if not full focus, assometimes the play is also going on in my head in the background. Though this is not exactly what is desired during yoga, what is desired--a full acceptance of the body-mindin the present moment--means that yoga and I can both handle it. I am aware of, attentive to, and accept the fact thatmy body-mind is 1) preoccupied 2) can do two things at once, and 3) I am OKwith that. Actors need to be able to do that, anyway, in case a doorknob fallsoff (the past) or a hearing aid in the audience sends out a whistling-tea-kettle noise (last night). We still carry on with the scene!"},
{"title": "No Groundhogs", "date": "Thursday, February 3, 2022", "text": "It's February 3, and I just went through the house, changing the calendars from January to February. We are snowed in. Last night's rehearsal was cancelled, and perhaps tonight's will be, too, which is really a preview performance, but, egad!--we have barely had a dress rehearsal. Anxiety balanced by yoga. I did not see any groundhogs in real life or on the news (because I wasn't watching the news), but I did see what I thought was a large owl, hunkered down in the snow, scanning the yard for small prey. It transformed, via head movement, into a rabbit, a huge rabbit, just sitting out there in the snow, flicking its now visible ears. Oddly, there is a reference to groundhogs in Life Sucks, the play. Hence, another Random Coinciday in the blog.My husband is repairing a sort-of-inherited broken snowblower in our family room. Occasionally, I go out and press the red bar while he watches the motor. A horrible sound has been transformed to a snowblower-motor sound by the adjustment of a shredded belt. More transformation! (See above owl-to-rabbit story.) Perhaps soon the driveway can transform from drifted to driveable with less back strain!I have been resting, eating, reading, going over lines, doing yoga, and trying to transform myself from anxiety-ridden to relaxed. Watching comic movies sort of helps, in reassuring me that comedy is organic, coming from the usual human place. Plus timing.Reading always helps. I read The Jesus Cow by Michael Perry, which is comedy (tragicomedy), arising from the usual human places. And now I am reading At Paradise Gate, by Jane Smiley, which might be too close for comfort. A man is sick in his bed upstairs, and his daughters want to move him downstairs. My dad is in the midst of planning a creative transformation of his own house, to move his bedroom downstairs. We none of us oppose this, and we understand the impulse while dreading the disruption to my parents' usual routines...Meanwhile, it's still winter, it's newly February, some of my anxiety is from scheduling weekly Covid tests due to the play, and I am sort of happy to be snowed in."},
{"title": "Bathsheba and the Stinkbug", "date": "Sunday, January 30, 2022", "text": "It sounds like the title of a fable, yes? \"Bathsheba and the Stinkbug.\" But it's just a random coincidence, one of my favorite things. I'd been wanting to tell you that a stinkbug lives in our house, and how happy I am to see him, as I miss the praying mantis, who has disappeared from the houseplants--probably as a result of death, not perpetual molting. Stinkbugs, an invasive species here, often winter in houses, hibernating, or so Wikipedia tells me. (This image is by Hectonichus.) The stinkbug is known for its heraldic shield shape.Then Facebook brought forth a memory, the cover of my book, Spiritual Midwifery, which has an image based on a painting by my husband, Tony Rio, of a woman at her bath (or that's what I see), just like the biblical Bathsheba, at her bath on a rooftop when David saw her, fell in love, and (perhaps on purpose) sent her husband, Uriah, to battle, where he conveniently died, so David could marry Bathsheba. You don't hear that name often, but my character in Life Sucks is Babs, a nickname for Bathsheba, her real name. And when I opened the new issue of Granta, dedicated to travel writing, the first article is by Bathsheba Demuth, who went to Russia to see the gray whales. What are the odds? Plus, Babs has Ukrainian ancestry--Ukraine of Eastern Europe, bordering and/or controlled by Russia at various times, and still vulnerable and in the news--and Life Sucks is \"sort of adapted from Uncle Vanya,\" by Anton Chekhov, a Russian playright, whose birthday was yesterday. The gray whales are on the Alaska side of Russia. Probably Sarah Palin, also in the news again, for eating in a New York restaurant while having Covid, can see them out her window when she goes home again. Sigh...I noticed that the stinkbug appears when I put in the A.M. Yoga DVD, flying joyfully (it seems to me) around the room to new age music, as I do my relaxation and stretching as a warmup for rehearsal, and to calm my distracted, mourning mind, or when I take a snack upstairs after rehearsal, often with vodka--the play is full of vodka--which 1) I can't have before rehearsal but which 2) is not such a good re-hydration beverage, so I also drink water and/or Gatorade. What do stinkbugs eat? Plants and fruit, not vodka or peanut butter on graham crackers. Why is the stinkbug in my bedroom and not in the kitchen with the houseplants and fruit?And then I discovered...the other stinkbug! There are two! But they are probably not mating. And they might both be males. And there might be more than two. Wikipedia tells me one house had 26,000 stinkbugs. Fortunately, they are happy here, however many of them there are, and they are not stinking up the place. And probably they'll go back to sleep soon.Yesterday was the memorial service for my poet friend Bill. What a lovely event, and we read several of his poems aloud. His wife and sons spoke, colleagues, and a close friend who is a retired Unitarian minister. Bill was not a churchgoing man, but he wanted her to say his eulogy. His son and grandson, opera singers, sang! Laughter and tears. Cello music. Veterans presenting colors. Masks. Exactly what was needed. Life goes on, and loss is part of it. Babs says something like this in the play. But nothing about stinkbugs. That's just me."},

A friend just died, not of Covid but of Parkinson's, and though we knew it was coming, and he and his wife had time to prepare, it is still a shock and will be an ongoing sadness. Some of us mourners will read some of his poems at his memorial service later this month. You can donate to the William Morgan Poetry Award here.Another friend feels \"done.\" It's not quite despair but a kind of retreat into \"winter blues.\" He expresses himself here and encourages our response, in words or the wise use of our time.My parents are tired of the brutal cold, though grateful for the recent sunshine, as am I. They are very old: as of January 15, the same age, 89, for about a month, till Dad turns 90 in March. They have lived miraculously healthy, productive, creative, lucky lives, right up until now. More gratitude! But the end of their lives has been shadowed by this pandemic, as you can imagine, since we are all under the same shadow. Like my friend Basel, above, feeling the winter blues, I am weary.Meanwhile, I continue to rehearse Life Sucks, a sort of perfect play for our times, given its title, and we are in that stressful time moving toward production week and an opening in early February. I am in the \"What was I thinking?\" stage I encounter with every play, but all shall be well, and all manner of things shall be well, do doubt.Truly, what was I thinking? But I ran this by a counselor helping me through the stress of caregiving, and she was all for an activity that was not caregiving...which makes perfect sense. And my hope now is to float everything I am feeling and balancing into anything my character can use. Because what else can I do? Oh, read! Escape to Greece! Mythical and modern Greece, in A Thing of Beauty, a travel book by Peter Fiennes. For my downtime on the couch, cuddling under the blue fleece."},
{"title": "All the Stars", "date": "Sunday, January 16, 2022", "text": "It turns out my jumbled mind has pulled itself together via the stars. I read two books recently with stars in the titles and on the covers: The Pull of the Stars, by Emma Donoghue, about the 1918 pandemic as it affects a maternity ward in Ireland, and Wiping Stars from Your Sleeves, poems by David James. Both provided quiet moments of focus on something other than work tasks, home tasks, caregiver tasks, and memorizing lines. My mind moved back into its jumble rather easily any time I slipped in a bookmark.For example, I actually reviewed the poetry book for Escape Into Life, as David James is one of our EIL poets. I set up the post to publish automatically...on Wednesday...and then forgot about it till Friday.Caregiver tasks included visiting my folks several times and accompanying my dad to a doctor's appointment, where I was shocked to see a woman sitting in the waiting room completely unmasked. I reminded him to keep his mask over his nose, and I was double-masking (medical + cloth), but I couldn't understand why the medical receptionists hadn't reminded or cautioned the woman. Later, I saw her in her mask, so maybe it was just a memory lapse...something I understand. I had forgotten till I read it again in The Pull of the Stars that \"influenza\" actually refers to the influence of the stars, once thought to cause that illness.And apparently I am still drafting poems I let loose and forget about. The working titles perhaps reveal my state of mind?: \"Holding Myself,\" \"I Wept,\" \"Forgotten Forms of Joy,\" \"Calories from Wine.\" And an untitled one that might turn out to be called \"Hear Myself Sing,\" which sounds more optimistic!I've come out of rehearsal at night into dense fog--so fitting!--and startlingly clear skies, full of, you guessed it, stars, stars, stars!"},
{"title": "Lying to Myself", "date": "Friday, January 7, 2022", "text": "I haven’t been doing toomuch poetry writing lately, but one morning this week I drafted a poem called“Lying to Myself,” that sort of veered off topic as if to demonstrate thetitle. Furthermore, when I flipped the pages of the poem-drafting notebook, Isaw that I had been drafting poems all along, just not doing much further withthem. Sometimes I typed them into my computer, revising a bit, et cetera, butsome just sat there languishing… Then a friend sent me atext with a link to a New York Timesarticle on languishing as a state of unfocused mind during Covid, notdepression but also not flourishing. Yes, it clicked. Thanks, Chris! It was anarticle from April 2021, revisited in December 2021, and I couldn’t read it onmy phone, and I hope can see it via this link, but I could read it on mycomputer, thanks to an electronic subscription given to me by a friend. Thanks,Scott!It was comforting to learnthat I’d intuitively found ways over the past year and a half to both comfortand focus myself, and that I didn’t have to see all my tactics as escape oravoidance but rather as real strategies to fend off too much languishing. Icould create temporary “flow”—that state of time both suspended and flashing byduring intense focus on a creative project or sports—when drafting even thepoems I forgot (or didn’t revise or submit later). I could get steadysatisfaction from small daily tasks and goals. I could, as I did, immersemyself in other stories than my own, every time I read a book or watched amovie, and I did a lot of that. Right now, despite highCovid positivity and with plenty of safety protocols in place, I am rehearsinga play—an excellent form of distraction from the current reality that immersesme deeper in the ongoing human reality, and an excellent form of intense focus.Even if we never get to perform the play, if there’s another shutdown, this isa good thing to do. And if others get to see it, the immersion in the otherhuman story—hilarious and sad—that will be good, too. As long as we are allvaccinated and wearing masks! I love that the play iscalled Life Sucks.

The invisible woman at the top of the stairs is gone, Halloween making way for Thanksgiving and Christmas, starting with this Ho Ho Ho arrangement in her place: an actual present, already wrapped, with the wrapping paper near at hand when needed, for those who are paying attention. (I do expect a query in December: \"Where's the Christmas wrapping paper?\")I am happy, too, having scored a DVD version of \"A.M. Yoga with Rodney Yee\" in the ongoing library book-movie-music sale!* My old, worn out VHS version finally busted in the old, worn out VHS half of the dual DVD/VHS player, breaking it, too. So this morning I resumed \"A.M. Yoga\" and feel totally at peace. Rodney was as young as ever, still saying, \"For seventeen years, I have started each morning...\" as I had, with him, for about seventeen years; I have a lot more white hair now, and he has his same, sweet little Buddha of a pot belly on a sleek, relaxed body...but (is it the distortion of my screen or the trauma of the Trump years?), for the first time, I noticed Rodney's tiny hands.*and also Tony Bennett's Duets!The green chalkboard is stored in the basement again, now awaiting use as a Welcome board at my daughter's wedding next spring! But here's a pertinent chalkboard poem from the past:Body talk: “Resuming yogais harder than resumingpoems. Reconsider.”This is a yoga program for beginners, and I am always a beginner. I could easily resume because it was all so familiar. I encountered my usual challenge areas, where my body doesn't stretch as easily, and it gives me something always to work on., though I'm not sure I'll ever be able to bend completely forward to the floor while sitting cross-legged, nor rise into a perfect cobra arch. But maybe \"A.M. Yoga\" will help me sustain \"beginner's mind\" in my various endeavors and adventures.After \"A.M. Yoga,\" I was energized for morning chores--dusting, sweeping, rearranging, taking vegetable matter out to the compost heap in the \"re-purposed\" old sandbox now covered with eager ivy, stretching into the compost and beyond, starting to climb the volunteer tulip poplar growing too close to the fence. The DVD version of \"A.M. Yoga\" has new ads for the Gaiam company, all about sustainable living. While I don't have a completely organic/natural lifestyle, I do have a compost heap!I love how the wrapping paper colors this year go with my stack of books (which also preceded the invisible woman at the top of the stairs) and my pale turquoise (or is that seafoam green?) ribbon and how the blue tulips from a play I directed also fit in. Arranging doodads in my house is another form of \"a.m. yoga\" for me sometimes, helping me gather the loose ends of my mind like a small bouquet."},

I've been going outside in my robe or a long sweater over my jammies to write in the mostly dark, but this morning I waited till closer to 7:00 a.m., and I like how there's a rectangle of light in the upper left, almost like a vertical postcard, of morning coming, and a light in the window at the corner/curve house, the house where two big trees came down over the past year or so, and where a widow lives, and now several of the poems tie together in very particular, neighborhood ways.Because of the dark and the damp, I didn't always see my imperfect erasing. Yesterday, I noticed I was writing an \"s\" over the ghost of a previous \"s.\" So these tiny poems have been layered over each other. Ghost words.On Thursday night, I participated in the Patricia Dobler Poetry Award reading! What a (scary) delight! (I always get nervous before poetry readings and plays, no matter how many times I do them!) Jan Beatty hosted the event, and read a poem by Patricia Dobler. This year's winner, Shirley Jones Luke, read her winning poem and others. Denise Duhamel, the judge in my year, introduced me, and I read \"Fox Collar,\" my winning poem, and other mother poems. Then Denise read a set of wonderful poems, including some mother poems. Sarah Williams was our fabulous Zoom stage manager. A lovely event!I had practiced my poems by reading to my husband and kids, and then sent them off to visit my parents with carry-out dinner. Too nervous to have them all in the Zoom with me, probably especially because of the mother poems, that my mother has already read, so she's OK with them, no worries!! My sister and her husband were able to tune in for part of it while traveling to a family wedding in Wisconsin. Thanks for sobbing, Chrissy! And several loving friends were there, a sweet surprise. Thank you, dears. It has been a joy to share my poems with you all, in the various ways I do, and I am grateful, honored, and awed.Postcardto the world:you are beautiful, always,even in sorrow."},
{"title": "Familiar/Scary Things", "date": "Saturday, October 30, 2021", "text": "I'm reading Smile, by playwright/poet Sarah Ruhl, subtitled The Story of a Face. I love her plays, was in The Clean House, and would love to direct or be in Dear Elizabeth, her play based on the letters of poets Elizabeth Bishop and Robert Lowell. Smile is about her smile, specifically her experience with Bell's palsy, and I am learning all about when she was on bed rest with twins during the Broadway opening of her first play, In the Next Room, or the vibrator play.Reading about her discovery of the slip of her smile, I recalled seeing my face in the mirror one early morning and noticing that my eye had fallen down. Did I have a stroke? I wondered. Later in the day, my eye had replaced itself, but still! Did I have a small stroke? A brief, self-healing version of Bell's palsy? Who knows? But it was scary/familiar to read about this in Sarah Ruhl's memoir, making it a Halloweenish Random Coinciday in the blog.The face-falling incident in my own life occurred around the time my upper eyelid--on that side!--got an itchy, sort of a scaley rash. My doctor did not suggest shingles or Bell's palsy but instead asked if I had put anything on my face lately, and the answer was yes, some sunscreen made for the face, as I had been out in the sun reading. She said other patients had been reporting reactions to sunscreen on the face, and to wear a hat instead, so I've been doing that since, no further problems. But if it was a mild Bell's palsy/shingles, maybe I don't have to schedule the shingles vaccine everyone is telling me to get--mainly because 1) shingles is awful, and 2) it seems to be going around town. Sigh...  I got the flu shot--body wracked by shivers that night--and do not qualify for the Covid booster. (Too young! Don't get to say that very often anymore!) I dread the shingles vaccine because 85% of people get side effects, and how can I fit it into my busy schedule knowing I'll have to set aside 2-3 days to feel icky and not scare people with symptoms. What a blessing if I have already had this and my body cured itself.Speaking of blessings, this morning I posted the second-to-last chalkboard poem for the month of October. I am hoping it comforts and resonates with my sister-in-law, whose mother died last night, simply and quietly, lying down after dinner. This was both expected and unexpected, but was a gentle and good way for her to go, and her family is feeling peace as well as sorrow. I send vibrations of love and comfort out to all who are sad and suffering right now, all who are grieving, stressed, or worried. It's been raining here, with dark and windy mornings, a true October, with sudden flashes of fiery red and glorious yellow trees through the mist of it all.Everything has cometo me in its time, asked foror not, as a blessing."},

This, in addition to candy and doodads, is how I am celebrating Halloween.There is a connection. The skirt she wears is a summer skirt, recently moved from my closet to elsewhere (my daughter's closet) to make room for cold-weather clothes in the annual closet shift. The shirt is long-sleeved, so appropriate for the current season (and stuffing with tissue paper), but a man's shirt with buttons on the other side (from my perspective). The boots (in the shadows) will have to be rescued soon for seasonal use.Here she is at the top of the stairs, like any scary thing. My husband and I still get freaked out by her, any time we exit the bathroom or bedroom. The kids are coming for a visit, and, if they don't read my blog in time, they are in for a surprise. She's right outside their bedrooms, too!The thing I was realizing is that I haven't fully made the paradigm shift from isolation to...less isolation...so I will not be prepared for the possible lifting of the state mask mandate in time for the holidays, which is the gossip in the news right now. We were sort of shoved into the isolation paradigm with the \"stay at home\" order in March 2020, and I got used to all that, even when I went back to work. I don't think I will be able to go into public places without a mask for a longish time... Talk about scary things!The chalk board poems continue. Perhaps this one fits the Invisible Woman! In fact, my phone often tells me \"fingerprint not recognized,\" and, indeed, my fingerprints seem to be fading away due to years of work with paper and plastic and/or aging. Sometimes the parking garage touch screen rejects me, too. It's weird to be slipping away. One day a man in my workplace asked if my husband was still alive. It gave me pause. (Turns out he had met my husband in another context, alive and well!!) My kids see me as looking younger than my age, but they haven't seen me for a while. Wonder what they will think?"},

Yesterday I saw this on my way to the homecoming parade:The heron standingquietly in Sugar Creekturns to watch the dogcrossing the bridge.I was crossing another bridge, the one the street and sidewalk take over the creek, and it was a wonderful parallel moment, perhaps like something to be found in The Ghost Variations, the heron as still as a vision until it moved, very, very interested in the dog! This is the same creek and crossing where I saw a Siamese cat in the grass and a fox in the playground. I love my path to and from town!Just finished Magic Lessons, by Alice Hoffman, my book club book, and returned it to the libary. It is the \"prequel\" to the famous Practical Magic, which precedes her book just out now. Must get caught up. Magic Lessons takes us back to Salem, Massachusetts, tying in the notorious witch trials and other bits of history. Also getting in the mood with spooky movies lying around the house: Donnie Darko, with a time loop of the sort 1) I get lost in and 2) that's like a \"ghost variation,\" and Ghost Town, with Ricky Gervais, which is like The Sixth Sense as a heartwarming comedy."},

Tony measured, and I took notes, and, of course, wrote a tiny poem at the bottom of the page. Beside the deer blind,three abandoned honeycombs,branch of black walnuts.It became this morning's chalkboard poem. On down the road is the Parklands Foundation Merwin Preserve, so we walked the woods there, witnessing leaf fall and more black walnuts, the U-shaped tree and the bending tree near the Mackinaw River, and hearing a deer (?) or some large animal (!) clear its throat...!On the trail, I wrote another tiny poem, having brought clipboard, paper, and pencil along. On the road back, I noted the irony of the road sign: pictorial leaping deer + \"next 2 miles.\" My heart split, sending out the warning, Stay where you are! to the deer in the preserve, and wishing for Bill his last venison sausage. Alas, we did see a small deer dead by the side of the road.The deer blind needs a new door. We have one sitting in our back yard, leaning against the tool shed, left over from another project. I hope it fits!"},
{"title": "Fairy Lights", "date": "Sunday, October 3, 2021", "text": "We keep two strings of fairy lights up year-round now, in the kitchen. It's a soft and magical light, all that's needed in the evening if we drift in and out of the kitchen for water or ice cream. And exactly what we need on a dark day, to cheer us up and light the way.We needed this rain. I've begun my small poems again, one a day on the kids' battered chalkboard (easel for painting on the other side), previously stored in the basement, leaning on a fireproof file cabinet. I haven't done this in October before. So far, it's going fine. It's fun, and it makes people happy. I stand the chalkboard up in the dirt beside the front stoop under the eaves. I take a little stool out to sit on and write. Then I take a picture. This morning I had to figure out how to turn off the automatic flash...so it would still be dark around the edges. (I didn't know how yet on October 1st.) It was easy. Why am I so technology illiterate? I am so competent at many other things.My parents are visiting my sister in Nebraska, to see her production of A Midsummer Night's Dream. Opening night was a great success. On Saturday, there was no show because it was a game day. Football takes precedence over theatre in Nebraska.The plan was to walk in the local Women's March on October 2, but it was postponed till next weekend, due to storms predicted by radar, that never came. (Came modified in late afternoon, and gently overnight.) A thousand people showed up in Chicago, where the weather was still fine. Some showed up, chatted, and walked here, as the word had not got out, but most of us will try again next weekend. In the absence of what I had planned, life happened. And it was good."},
{"title": "Harvest in Progress", "date": "Wednesday, September 29, 2021", "text": "It's late September, harvest in progress. I think I mean that metaphorically as well as literally. These are images of my dad climbing into and out of the red and green harvesting machines. Our neighbor is a farmer, the grandson of the farmer who lived there till he was 101. I say \"our,\" but I haven't lived there for a long time. It was my childhood home.This past weekend, my husband and I took a trip through the fields, harvest in progress, to Moraine View State Recreation Area to walk the wooded trails. Lots of corn, soybeans at the ready, and the wonderful tall white wind turbines of the windfarms. At the moraine, we walked around a finger of the lake and through a tent camping area with no tent campers; we saw black walnuts hanging from the trees, ginormous orange fungi like smashed pumpkins. It's been a glorious fall so far with summery weather. It was a perfect \"self care\" weekend after a week of stress.These days whole scenarios play themselves out in my head. Practical plans line up as excellent mental outlines, then disappear. I wake up at 3:30 a.m., read the new issue of The Sun, want to contact all the writers in it to say how much I enjoyed their work, and set it aside, never doing so. Disrupted sleep patterns are my new way of life; it doesn't stress me out, as I don't resist it. In odd little bunches, I get enough sleep.Somehow everything gets done. I have to write each thing on a physical weekly calendar, checking it off as I do it. Medical appointments, theatre meetings, deadlines. When I visit my parents, I bring this calendar with me, comparing it to the large wall calendar in their kitchen. I make sure the two calendars match. I add things, I erase things.These pictures are out of order. In the one just above, he's grabbing the sides of the ladder of the steps to go up. With their arms open, this looks like a gorgeous greeting. Up I go, into the harvesting machine. Hello, hello! What a beautiful blue sky behind it all.When he came down, my dad said it was sort of scary in the machines. Way up there, very loud. It reminded me of when my son was a toddler, and Gus (still alive!) invited him up into the combine. We almost did it, but I imagined my son up in the cab, the noise beginning, the terror, my son wailing, reaching out for me, unable to exit. I couldn't put any of us through that. Ah, I have a poem about this.It's almost October. Later in the month, my kids are coming for a visit. I hope they'll be able to spend some time with their grandparents, looking over photo albums; if it's warm enough still, sitting in the yard, gazing over the fields at the windfarm horizon, the setting sun. If you look closely, you can see my dad on the steps of the machine."},
{"title": "Alexander's Bridge", "date": "Friday, September 10, 2021", "text": "The coincidences and connections continue in my reading. I forgot to tell you that, in White Noise, by Don DeLillo, \"The time of spiders arrived.\" Like now, September. The webs are at every entrance and exit to my home, hanging from trees by the compost heap, decorating the front columns that descend otherwise useless from the cantilevered porch roof. Why shouldn't they be homes for spiders?(I also noted the coincidence of spiders while re-reading and reviewing Marrow of Summer, by Andrea Potos, for Escape Into Life.)And that is a cantilevered bridge in Alexander's Bridge, by Willa Cather. (Though, I actually read the Dover Thrift edition.) This is a slim novel, as they say, probably a novella. I was interested in Cather's preface from 1922, where she seemed a little embarrassed by the book, as something written before she had found her true material (pioneers, the Great Plains, Nebraska!). To me, it held together quite well and led to an interesting proposition about the \"great man,\" about whom we can't know everything: \"The mind that society had come to regard as a powerful and reliable machine, dedicated to its service, may for a long time have been sick within itself and bent upon its own destruction.\" Naturally, I connected this to Don DeLillo's White Noise characters' theories that Adolf Hitler and Elvis Presley held the seeds of their own destruction within the coincidence of their too close connections with their mothers... Hmmm.Now I'm inside a Nancy Horan novel while reading outside in the glorious September days, and soon must move on to some Lydia Millett I got through interlibrary loan, realizing the book I found in the library sale is part of a loose trilogy... Reading is a way I am holding everything together in a somewhat stressful time of many, many details. Some sweet news is that I got together with photographer Ken Kashian yesterday to sign copies (in pencil on archival paper) of his latest small art book, in a box, with tiny images and tiny poems (by me!) tucked in pockets that fold up accordion style. Only 14 copies for special collections. Lovely!Also hmmm: perhaps I am a bit of a spider myself. (Or two fish.)"},
{"title": "White Noise", "date": "Monday, September 6, 2021", "text": "Here's another book I'd been wanting to read and happened to read at exactly the right time for me: White Noise, by Don DeLillo. I read this paperback edition, and will also show the cover provided by Wikipedia, presumably the hard cover edition. It was published in 1985, which shows how behind I am! And yet it fits our times re: consumerism, incessant \"waves and radiation,\" and ongoing dangers from pollutants of various kinds. There is even some mask wearing, re: a \"toxic airborne event.\"There's also this exchange about a guy seeking danger, which frustrates the guy wishing to avoid death:     \"He's asking for it.\"     \"That's right. Most of us spend our lives avoiding danger. Who do these people think they are.\"     \"They ask for it. Let them get it.\"This is dangerously close to my own frustration re: the adamantly unvaccinated, and I have definitely heard this attitude voiced around me! \"Let them get it,\" indeed. Alas, they infect others also or instead. I know some who resist the vaccine have legit reasons, and some have been misled but are true believers in what they've been told by non-legit sources. Sigh... But still.What a gorgeous holiday weekend! I did my reading outside, and today is the Labor Day Parade. The blue sky is mostly lifting my personal blues, despite the simmering frustration and ongoing communal grief. I surprised myself by submitting some poems yesterday. Others are coming out this fall. But everything still feels suspended and slightly unreal to me. It helps to prick my fingers on coneflower seeds, sprinkling some on the earth for next year while tidying the flowerbeds. I leave some up all year for the birds. Next year, it's possible the blackberry lilies and coneflowers and wild violets will take over the universe of my back yard, while lilies of the valley march down into the shared valley between houses. In the meantime, I do hope walking and gardening will undo my crankiness. For now, it's a rare Cranky Doodle Day in the blog and an actually glorious day outdoors!"},
{"title": "The Death of the Heart", "date": "Saturday, September 4, 2021", "text": "The Death of the Heart, by Elizabeth Bowen, turns up on so many recommended lists, and now, finally, I have read it and agree. What was I waiting for? Really, I had looked for it before at the library, and finally it turned up in the library sale, along with others recommended in The Writer's Library, exactly when I needed them. I kept picturing this girl on the cover as Portia, the main character, or my niece, keeping things interesting and personal. Indeed, it's all personal to Portia...but not to the others, until, suddenly, it sort of is. As it must be, I suppose, to avoid the death of the heart.I also read Waiting for the Parade, a play by John Murrell, that takes place in Alberta, Canada during World War II. A cast of 5 women, 20s to 50s, so a good one to recommend to local theatres. I saw it at Steppenwolf in the 1980s and never forgot Rondi Reed's wonderful performance as Marta, the German woman. And now I am waiting for the Labor Day Parade, on Monday. I'll be walking in it as a Democrat, in blue, with a blue mask. Plus, I've been feeling a little blue. It helped to pull a lot of weeds along the fences, and hack away various branches from volunteer maple trees, if I could not pull them up by the roots."},

Yesterday, as September began its beautiful weather, I took a walk with a friend* through a good set of trails for birds. We saw a serious photographer getting some good shots and keeping us from getting lost! I've been happy with my summer of back yard cardinals, wrens, and goldfinches, awed by the occasional hawk, and involved in the various crow conversations...And, of course, there were birds in the various books of poetry I read in August! Crows, sandhill cranes, and whooping cranes, as mentioned, but others, too!*the same friend I saw this movie with, as I recall! (My recall is sort of haphazard, so maybe she told me about it...but I think we saw it together! It was a thing we did sometimes, back in the days of going to movie theatres. I know we saw It's Complicated together, because I remember laughing a lot. Wait, both these movies have Steve Martin in them. Maybe we only went to Steve Martin movies together. This blog entry started out completely differently. Hmm, it has turned into a Random Coinciday in the blog!)"},
{"title": "Sealey Challenge Accomplished!", "date": "Wednesday, September 1, 2021", "text": "What a joy it was to read 31+ books for the Sealey Challenge in August! I feel grateful to have engaged with so many poems and poets, mostly reading outdoors, sometimes curled on the couch. Here is a picture of my stack of books. Not all the spines show, but 1) you get the idea and 2) you saw all the covers here, if you were following along.Let me know if you'd like me to send you a little bundle of poetry books or chapbooks for next year. Send me an email (email address given on the Contact page above) with your name and address, and I'll put something in the mail for you at some point. We have a whole year! It might not be something from this stack, as I've formed connections with some of these, but don't worry, I have other stacks, last year's stack for instance (same picnic table, different stack!), stacks on the coffee table, on the stairs, plus baskets and shelves full of books...  Sigh... Another one came yesterday, Took House, by Lauren Camp, and I'll discuss that at Escape Into Life, along with other books by EIL poets that have waited patiently in yet another stack, inside a dresser drawer on the floor of my office. Creative organizational technique, sturdy out-of-the-box \"box.\" And I picked up another in the ongoing library sale, The Clerk's Tale, by Spencer Reece, today. It's almost like an addiction.Speaking of Escape Into Life, the Labor Day 2021 feature is up today, with poems that have work/labor in them. Go see!"},
{"title": "And There is Many a Good Thing", "date": "Tuesday, August 31, 2021", "text": "I turned to Jon Tribble's book, And There is Many a Good Thing (Salmon Poetry, 2017), not only for its perfect fall-is-coming cover, but also for the positive, optimistic sentiment in its title. The cover image is \"The Blue Leaf\" by Allison Joseph, poet, Jon's wife, and, alas, now his widow. I have the Irish cover, with the leaf turned sideways, as you can see here. Shown is, presumably, the American cover, which you can also see at Amazon. Either way, a lovely cover, though I prefer mine, probably because it is mine. Once again, I read alert to the intersections of this poet's book with my own life, and this book with the others I've read this August for the Sealey Challenge. This book goes to Mexico, like The Death of a Migrant Worker. It has fishing poems, like The Mysteries of Fishing and Flight and Night Angler. It has constellations and whooping cranes, free verse and pantoum, elegy and grief, \"and there is many a good thing,\" like music and food. These things do sustain us, as I hear in the final stanza of the opening poem, \"The Divine\":     as the final note possesses Sarah Vaughan, possesses us,     documents the sound we should define as pain,     as regret, as love and loss, as human.And I realized this book contains two of Jon's poems I had included in an anthology some years ago, poems of place and origin, Where We Live: Illinois Poets. Good to meet them again here.Yesterday, telling you about Men, Women, and Ghosts, I also told you about my dream of a wild, baby pig. Strange and delightful to encounter Tribble's poem titled \"Long Stories About Short Pigs.\" In the first story, a beggar boy takes a wild ride on a metal pig. Then my heart broke when the poem shifted to \"the last Vietnamese family / pressed into the metal belly of the cargo / chopper\" and made the connection, as many have been doing these last few days, of the exit from Vietnam and the exit from Afghanistan, leaving people behind. More heartbreak in \"Banner Days in America,\" a poem that starts with burning a flag and ends with folding one.Indeed, for all the delights in this book, heartbreak, injustice, trouble, or irony are right there in the background, perhaps in a restaurant, enjoying Chinese food, while a boy and his grandmother talk about things you'd rather not have to overhear. \"A pig is never only a pig,\" Tribble reminds me, and, alas, \"a fairy tale is only a fairy tale.\" Sometimes there are no happy endings. In \"Lucky Life,\" about the need for riverboat casinos, \"[a] few spindly antennas\" in small towns are \"shaping these lives to All-American mold.          Huddled about the pixilated fire,     cartoon promises guarantee That's all,     folks! with piggish glee, but is it?Ah, yes, the pig of my childhood. But this is a grown-up book.I was grateful to see Jon and Allison get married again in \"Indiana Marriage,\" a poem I'd heard them read when they came to my town to read at the library. This time, the Key lime pie made me cry. And the last poem in the book, his \"Spirit Currency,\" a double elegy, for a mentor and a friend, resonated now for Jon: \"Wherever we travel, / there is no destination loss has not visited before us.\""},
{"title": "Men, Women, and Ghosts", "date": "Monday, August 30, 2021", "text": "This one I chose for its fabulous cover after becoming intrigued by Debora Gregor's In Darwin's Room. The cover art is Vanitas Still Life by Herman Henstenberg. In Men, Women, and Ghosts (Penguin, 2008), I found educated and allusive poems, imaginative, ekphrastic, and persona poems, some clever and funny, some connecting with women in myth and fairy tale so they seem at times to be engaging in a kind of pleasant, modest, self-mythologizing. As in \"Beauty in Florida,\" where we see Sleeping Beauty at 15 and 50.Here at the end of a month full of poetry books, I relaxed again into noticing where I intersect with the poems and where the books intersect with each other. \"Her Posthumous Life\" is in the voice of Fanny Brawne, someone I once played in a one-act about John Keats. (Wikipedia has a whole section on her \"Posthumous controversy\"!) Greger's poem ends, referring to a Keats ode,          To Darkness, it begins,     and then goes on. Goes on into darkness,          knowing the weight of earth.This, of course, connected with the darkness in Goldenrod.In \"Chekhov for Children,\" the speaker is a stagehand for the play Three Sisters, dressing Olga between scenes, just as I, as an understudy also playing a small role as a maid, dressed Masha backstage at Steppenwolf years ago! You never know when or how reading a poem might cause the past to wash over you.Or a dream. In \"Death Comes to Florida\" (which also reminds me of the news, now), an elegy for Donald Justice, Greger's image of Death as a wild boar reminded me of a recent morning dream of a wild baby pig sleeping under a baby blanket on my lap. (What does it mean?!)Side by side with all the intersecting, I just enjoyed the language, like this couplet from \"Missing\":     A water taxi opened the Grand Canal like a book.     Its pages were green, edges deckled with foam.And I should mention that it's August in \"The Marriage of Orpheus.\""},
{"title": "The Death of a Migrant Worker", "date": "Sunday, August 29, 2021", "text": "The Death of a Migrant Worker, by Gil Arzola (Rattle, 2021), is another of the wonderful Rattle Chapbook Prize winners I've been reading this August during the Sealey Challenge. I am so grateful to be learning about so many people's lives through their poems this month. In this book, his father dies in the opening poem, the title poem, and his mother dies or is dying in several thereafter, but his words keep them here a while, alongside his grief. In another kind of memory, another kind of grief, \"She sat up in bed / damp as a day in August,\" in the poem \"412 Beechwood Avenue Where I Lived.\" \"After that I was tossed / like eggs over easy.\"In \"Surviving Storms,\" I love the wisdom of bending to the wind like beach grass. Even a tree, until it can't, can \"give with the wind,\" as in \"The Difference Between Me, a Rock, and a Tree,\" and, like a poet, \"A tree has learned to pay attention.\" And I love the specificity of what he sees, as in \"A Poor Mexican Woman Makes Supper,\" when he begins: \"She measures nothing. She / tosses flour like confetti...\"And I love the coincidental similarity of the title \"Not Everything Should Be a Poem\" to a title in Maggie Smith's book Goldenrod, from yesterday. Smith's poem, called \"Not everything is a poem,\" sure turns out to be one, a listing of what a mother finds in her son's pockets before the wash! In Arzola's poem, where the title is a sort of warning, he says:     Some things need no words to be     immortal.     Some things matter enough     by themselves,     without description.True. Still, he does a fine job of describing the things he shows us, and evoking the importance of what he'll leave alone."},
{"title": "Goldenrod", "date": "Saturday, August 28, 2021", "text": "Here is another clear-voiced Ohio poet, like Rita Dove (yesterday!) or Mary Oliver, who are among the Ohio poets included in Maggie Smith's intermittent \"Ohio Cento,\" a series of poems in Goldenrod using lines by various Ohio poets to shape new poems. They are beautiful and deep. \"Everything is true,\" says her daughter in the poem \"Lacrimae,\" which means tears. And everything feels true to me in the poems in this book. And how delightful that the title poem takes place \"near Peoria,\" and I am near Peoria! And the goldenrod is near to blooming, as summer ends and fall is looming.This is the poet of \"Good Bones,\" that poem that comforted us even as it looked reality in the face. Here, I feel her melancholy, her despair at the state of our country, her questioning of what it means to be human right now, \"who cringes to say recognition,\" looking at the mirror in the poem \"Walking the Dog.\" Yes, it's hard to see ourselves when we look at humanity today. In all the ways.Still, I recognize myself in her poems--\"near Peoria,\" yes, but also \"In the Grand Scheme of Things\" with wrens chattering in the back yard...which happened while I was reading this morning, the screen door open. I identify with her in \"Poor Sheep\": \"I am transparent and quiet.\" I recognize the \"gray mange\" and remember the \"wolf\" in \"Wild.\" I, too, feel like I am \"feeding myself to the hungry future.\"There are bones in this book. But this is a book of \"the good dark,\" not the \"good bones.\" In \"How Dark the Beginning,\" she asks:     We talk so much of light, please     let me speak on behalf     of the good dark. Let us     talk more of how dark     the beginning of a day is."},
{"title": "Playlist for the Apocalypse", "date": "Friday, August 27, 2021", "text": "I let myself read this one, Playlist for the Apocalypse, by Rita Dove (Norton, 2021), in the shade, in the breeze, the heat and its heat advisory having lifted, on the patio this morning. Lovely to read a new book by Rita Dove, in her own clear voice, and in the voices of many others--human and cricket, dead or alive, and even the Statue of Liberty, who is \"Liberty's pale green maiden, stranded\" in \"The Sunset Gates.\" I took few notes, letting the poems and our shared history wash over me. I appreciated the notes at the end, giving context, and alerting me to how the poems in \"A Standing Witness\" were part of a collaborative song cycle, meant to be sung by mezzo-soprano Susan Graham, but delayed by the pandemic.The poems in a section called \"After Egypt\" are about the ghetto in Venice, and \"the first use of this word for segregated, and subpar, living quarters.\" In her notes for the poem \"Foundry,\" she explains, \"Ghetto is a derivation of ghet, Venetian dialect for foundry, and refers to the island where foundry slag was dumped before the Jews were forced to move there.\" Such sad and moving lines:        ...You think     as long as we stay where     you've tossed us, on     the slag heap of your regard,     the republic is safe.And, alas, that attitude is still out there, applied to many groups of people, unwanted by other groups who pretend they are protecting their republic.That section made me think of Shakespeare, his Merchant of Venice, and Shakespeare turns up in another poem, \"Shakespeare Doesn't Care,\" for writers possibly worried about their literary reputations:     What does he care     if we all die tomorrow?     He lives in his words. You wrestle,     enraptured, with yours.     What time does with them     next, or ever after,     is someone else's rodeo.I identified with \"Insomnia Etiquette,\" which begins, \"There's a movie on, so I watch it.\" I actually watch movies to fall asleep to at bedtime, and read a book if I wake in the night (often at 3:33 a.m.) \"I will regret / not being able to find / a book to get lost in,\" she says!And the \"Little Book of Woe\" section contains poems that address her multiple sclerosis, something her notes tell us she kept private for a while, so she could handle her illness on her own. I love the poem \"Soup,\" about...soup, just what we want when we're sick!"},
{"title": "Indigo", "date": "Thursday, August 26, 2021", "text": "Wasn't I reading this last year at this time? Re-reads are OK for the Sealey Challenge! Checking my blog, I realize I was reading Indigo, by Ellen Bass (Copper Canyon, 2020) last April, during lockdown. See the beautiful fish in this tattoo? I'm also reading Russell Banks's Success Stories (Harper & Row, 1986), with the fish cover, and just finished \"The Fish,\" a sort of fable. Once again, everything connects.Oh, yes, I remember \"smashing / the garlic with the flat of steel\" from \"Sous-Chef,\" the opening poem, and I'm back to smashing garlic this way myself, having broken two garlic presses over the past year. \"You say how much cinnamon / to spice the stew.\" When I walked into the kitchen this morning, I thought I smelled cinnamon...Yes, here are the orange and white high heels she shares with her mother. The chickens named Marilyn & Estelle. The bone china. \"Another spoonful of crème brûlée, / sweet burnt crust cracking\" (which reminds me of a Jeopardy answer-question). And the contemplation of a good and chosen death in the poem \"Enough,\" which ends with \"a fish that couldn't wait to be caught.\"\"Can a tree be lonely?\" is a question in a poem about the old dog Zeke. I'm reading indoors this time, in air conditioning, during a heat advisory in the delayed or prolonged dog days of August. In the next poem, it's December. Life goes as quickly as that. The poems of the mother, the mother dying, the mother in the vigor of her life before that. I was meant to be re-reading these poems today in a waiting room, but my mother had to cancel her appointment, not feeling well. In \"Wilderness,\" a love poem, the lines \"Tell them a story, / you are doing to die\" remind me of texts in Deathbed Sext, by Christopher Salerno, earlier this month. \"Because What We Do Does Not Die\" is a wonderful poem where the mother defends and supports her daughter, getting rid of a bad guy forever.Ah, here is old Zeke again, in \"Ode to Zeke.\" \"I'll fry you a fish.\" And here is the heroic Lynne, who revives a lizard who was drowning in the swimming pool, in \"Kiss,\" which is the kiss of life.And I do so love the poem \"Indigo,\" that starts with a tattooed man \"pushing one of those jogging strollers / with shock absorbers so the baby can keep sleeping\" and ends absorbing the shock of death in the strong, clear voice of a grown-up daughter who is wide awake."},
{"title": "New Life", "date": "Wednesday, August 25, 2021", "text": "New Life, by Dan O'Brien (Hanging Loose Press, 2016) is another example of the right book at the right time. Little did I know when I ordered it while seeking plays to suggest to Heartland Theatre--as O'Brien is also a playwright--how pertinent it would be to the new-current-ongoing situation in Afghanistan. The book is a sequel to War Reporter, and both are about the actual war reporter and Pulitzer-Prize winning photojournalist Paul Watson. O'Brien has written plays based on Watson's reportage and their relationship, and they've pitched scripts to Hollywood together. Their ventures in art as well as Watson's experience in Somalia, Afghanistan, Syria, and Iraq are part of this book, which also hopes for a \"new life\" away from war and back to family.\"The Poet in Afghanistan\" contains the lines, \"...The breaking news / from Kabul spooks the poet,\" and this must still be true, getting new life from the troubled military and civilian exit from Afghanistan now. It contains the brutal reality of danger to interpreters, and a concern for them side by side with the hardened attitude of a longtime reporter:          ...And anyway     Najib won't write back. Maybe he's escaped     to Pakistan? or had his hands hacked off     for interpreting me. But have no fear,     partner of mine. We'll find our new story     elsewhere in the meantime.This kind of violence pervades the book, along with fear, denial of fear, bravado in the face of fear. People are killed by the side of the road, in their homes or out; they're in danger for driving at night, for talking to the wrong person. They are damaged, physically (grenade, half-open window) and emotionally, and yet they go on, if they don't die. In \"The War Reporter Paul Watson Expects to Depart\" is this sobering reflection:          ...We spend so much of our time     criticizing presidents and generals     who feed school kids into the mouth of war     when what we should do is just pause and check     the courage of our own decisions.An opera has been made of War Reporter, and in \"The War Reporter Paul Watson on the Downward Slope,\" it's part of Watson's reflection on the death of his brother and the state of his heart and mind:          ...He'd been on the downward     slope since the day he was born. And truth is     I hardly feel a thing! I've felt more grief     taking pictures of corpses. That opera     tonight of my life has made me feel more     than my own brother's death. But that's no shock,     I guess. Music is peaceful, especially     all that singing.You hear the conversational tone here, as well as the agony and lack thereof, all of which switches back and forth throughout the book. Poet and reporter engage in email exchanges, phone conversations, fights over Hollywood pitches; they care about each other, they care about the world, and they want peace amidst \"all that singing.\"There are personal poems containing the joy of an expected baby, the grief for a dead friend. But there's a lot of the danger and violence and deadly repetition of the conflicts that lead to war. Even the personal, as in \"The Poet Confesses,\" expresses this awareness: \"We love war, your mother and I adore / our Shakespearean meltdowns.\" And history definitely repeats itself, as in \"The War Reporter Paul Watson in a Coffee Shop in Aleppo\":     Every revolution has a problem     with power. Submitting Afghanistan     as an example: jihadis will come     with strings attached.Alas, they are here now. The poem continues, and ends this way:          ... A young man rises. Your country     did nothing. Pointing, crying. I wonder     if he could hit me. Have I betrayed him     personally?

And isn't it a fantastic cover?--the illustration by Kelly Louise Judd!In the very first poem, \"First Night,\" is the first mention of the wolf: \"outside, in grass moon-wet with night, / a ghost Wolf guarded the yard.\" The Wolf is a \"Her\" and a \"ghost\" and is a presence throughout the book. Crows and the moon are part of the natural landscape here, as well as being images I found in some of the other books this month, but it was also a delightful surprise to find \"witchgrass\" again, right after yesterday's adventure with Gluck & Chang! And it is not August here in Kindred's book--more often October or November: \"Dear October,\" \"Which Way is November...\"There is a complicated mother-daughter relationship, and in \"Wednesday's Child\" the daughter is at her mother's bedside for a bittersweet couplet:     You have forgotten you're sorry     you had me.And a truly sweet ending with cake:     ... You do not want us     to die now. You want me     to try it, try it honey,     dulce, it's so sweet.\"The Grief Dress\" shows us the beautiful, sad family romance. And in \"I Tell What Kind of Girl\" is the liberation of telling one's story:     Through the white door     she could hear     the pinched hearts of asphodel--     and then it opened     like mercy, like breath,     when she began to tell.\"Wolf Hour\" brings us into the woods and into a timeless hour in numbered sections. Section 2:     Still you'll walk     these woods dulled by oaks,     dusk-muddled, staggering their golds--     the leaves torn,     withholding--these woods     without wolf's throat, her cape, and the wind     all hinge and pity.Gorgeous. I love how the sounds and the scatter of words on the page help the wind do its work. In the same poem, the line, \"You had a mother once\" hurts. \"She spoke in the language of wolves // and the moon heard and shut its stone door.\"And the poem \"Mast Year\" taught me what a mast year is, one that contains a bumper crop of fruit or nuts. The internet tells me 2020 was a mast year for acorns. \"My mother still knows what a mast year is\" though she's forgotten her daughter. Such sadness in this book, such beauty, such resilience. And, as it's still August when I emerge from these woods, I find joy in a bumper crop of peaches! Ah, a Fat Tuesday in the blog!"},
{"title": "Salvinia Molesta", "date": "Monday, August 23, 2021", "text": "As I took my book and pen and spiral notebook outside to read and take notes, it reminded me of homework, in a good way, awaking in me some back-to-school spirit. And Salvinia Molesta, by Victoria Chang (University of Georgia Press, 2008) provided some sad lessons in Chinese history inside its amazing poems. And there were crows and other coincidences, too.\"Jiang Qing\" is a persona poem with the epigraph: --Mao Zedong's wife committed suicide while under house arrest for crimes related to the Cultural Revolution. In it, she says     I used to speak so smoothly in pavilions, even     crows and clouds came down to hear.Chang's \"Ode to Iris Chang\" is about \"the December 1937 invasion of the Chinese city Nanking by the Japanese army,\" to quote the book's Notes, and another suicide. This book took me to other parts of the world, to new perspectives on my previous learning.And I learned what Salvinia molesta is, \"[k]nown as the world's worst weed,\" in that poem's epigraph but looking a lot like an aquatic plant in my town's water feature. Indeed, Wikipedia tells me it can be used to clean water of pollution, and I do think my town's greenery is self-watering and self-cleaning. So, hmm. But that title poem is also about a businessman tried and acquitted of obstruction of justice. So I keep learning. And the coincidences continue, words or images found in the other August books: cicadas, honeysuckle, pigs, cows, the moon, gardening, as in \"Spring Planting\":      I am gardening, but my mind is tilling. The crows enter my yard.     They remind me of ink slabs     Chinese calligraphers used--not until mixed with water did     their black ink breathe and broth.And then, thanks to one of Chang's Notes at the back of the book, I assigned myself a little compare-contrast homework. Chang says her poem \"'Ars Poetica as Birdfeeder and Humingbird' is conversing with Louise Gluck's poem 'Witchgrass' in Wild Iris, in particular, her lines: 'I don't need your praise / to survive' and 'I will constitute the field.'\" So I pulled out The Wild Iris, possibly my favorite book of poems ever, and re-read it, starting with \"Witchgrass\" before going back to the beginning. It hits me every time, that last line. And here's the last stanza before it, too:     I don't need your praise      to survive. I was here first,     before you were here, before     you ever planted a garden.     And I'll be here when only the sun and moon     are left, and the sea, and the wide field.     I will constitute the field.And in Chang's poem, \"I am not     a weed, I need your praise to survive.     The field will consume me.     The field has chosen sides. The field is     not hungry for the middling.     How I hate the field and what it sees, its     teeth digging out the ochre     of mediocre....Ah, the poet's worst fear! Being mediocre. And how wordplay partly disperses it! This and the other ars poetica poems in Salvinia Molesta are bracing, honest, inspiring. It feels good to be schooled so.And it was frequently August in The Wild Iris."},
{"title": "The Mysteries of Fishing and Flight", "date": "Sunday, August 22, 2021", "text": "I picked at random the next book in the Sealey Challenge pile and of course it has sandhill cranes in it, to continue the convergence of connections I mentioned yesterday. And dogs, dog days, constellations, and crows. Plus, as the title The Mysteries of Fishing and Flight, by Prize Americana winner Jacqueline K. Powers (The Poetry Press of Press Americana, 2011), plenty of fishing, though often the fishing and flight are metaphorical.I think this happened last August, too, that I kept finding amazing connections between all the poems, books, poets as I read, as well as the personal connections. Its not that we poets are so unoriginal, it's that we all see the world, we're attentive to some of the same remarkable things, and we remark on them!I did not find August in a poem here, but I did find bleeding heart and columbine from my own spring garden, and it was almost afternoon as I read Powers's \"Saturday Afternoon in the Garden,\" which also contained weeds. Since I had put off my necessary weeding the day before to read Debora Greger's book, I was glad I'd done early-morning weeding before I began the Powers book. She had seen \"two yellow finches\" in a poem, and I had seen two yellow finches feeding on the coneflower seedheads.I was also doing laundry in the background as I read the remarkable \"Feng Shui,\" which begins     It was a cup of coffee and throw     in another load of laundry     kind of morning...and then moves to the shock of a suicide attempt--\"but she was just a teen, they said / just a gesture, they said.\" I'm so glad and grateful for the survivors of this poem.I had favorites here, with titles that suggest why: \"Honeysuckle,\" \"Swimming Lesson.\" And I am familiar with chores that go undone, as in \"Relativity, Rain Barrels and Lies\":     You say it doesn't matter     when things get done,     or even if they don't.Behind me, as I read on the glider, loomed the volunteer maples that have overtaken the unmended fence... But now I'll just leave you with a great opening stanza from \"Just Another Star-Free Night\":     It seems the stars all moved     to some boxcar town in Kansas--     corn you can drown in,     rain like thunder-fall, a giant slide.There's definitely \"corn you can drown in\" right now in central Illinois, and it did finally rain a bit yesterday, but I am glad to say my husband and I stood outside as night fell, watching the stars pop out."},
{"title": "In Darwin's Room", "date": "Saturday, August 21, 2021", "text": "What's happening, as I read In Darwin's Room, by Debora Greger (Penguin Poets, 2012), is the convergence of connections: 1) to the other books I've been reading, and 2) to myself, as has been happening all along, as I engage joyfully with poets and their work in August. When I encounter the phrase \"ethereal pig\" in Greger's poem in the voice of John Keats--he wants to feed on \"the muddied blooms / of English spring!\"--I flash on Billy Collins's sudden discovery of the heretofore unknown \"constellation of the Pig\" in the sky of his poem \"Vocation,\" which also reminds me of the charming constellation poem in Molly Spencer's Hinge, \"Portrait of Hometown as Constellation.\" As the poems and my impressions of them blend, the tenses in which I describe them may mix, so watch out.The title, In Darwin's Room, made me think this would be a project book, all about Darwin and his journey on the Beagle. It isn't. There are Darwin poems, museum poems, travel poems, personal and far-reaching poems. Birds, bones, gardens, \"the oldest shirt in the world,\" the Dark Ages, the Ice Age, art, classrooms, trees, flora. It's all here. Persona poems, where she speaks in the voice the moon, the wind, a Monet painting, winter, the rain, a rat, her personal self at various ages and stages, and, as mentioned above, Keats.I connect to specific places referred to in these poems: Nebraska, Michigan, Florida. She lives part of the year in Gainesville, Florida, my childhood home (through kindergarten), and alligators turn up in her poems, which also made a big impression on me way back when. Ah, another connection: \"sandhill cranes...who wintered in Florida\" in Greger's poem \"Musica Mundana.\" Sandhill cranes were part of my childhood and a recent visit to Kearney, Nebraska, as well as being referenced in Sandra Beasley's Made to Explode! (My head may explode, as they say.) I even lived in England for a year, and Greger goes there in this book and in her actual life, her bio tells me.Greger's poem \"The Later Martyrs\" takes that deep dive that, yesterday in the blog, Billy Collins said poems should take (even when he chooses not to). From a childhood incident (broken bottle of ink at school, blood), she moves from innocence to \"a Quaker and...a Buddhist monk\" who \"turn themselves / into flame instead of into prayer, / one in Washington, one in Saigon.\" That sad, brutal history flares up again.And I was deeply moved by her \"Elegy on the Far Bank,\" for her father. Stanza one really hit home:     His taxes done, a garden planned,     my father didn't want even a night     in the hospital--then he lay his head back     and drifted away from the doctor.By stanza two, as implied here, he's dead, but at least \"[f]or the first time in days he slept, / better than he had for years.\" My father, alive, is sleeping better these days, some days. Like hers, mine hates hospitals. Mine has given up planning and planting his vegetable garden and, I think, thanks to an extension, is still working on his taxes. But the connections keep on coming, with references to Russian olive and cottonwood trees. My brother was just visiting from California, and as we walked the yard at my parents' house we were remarking on where the Russian olive trees once stood. At a recent family gathering in Michigan in June, it was cottonwood season, snowing and drifting everywhere.And then she takes a walk with her father: \"We climbed the Horse Heaven Hills, / my dead father and I.\" Is he \"[l]eft breathless // by his weakened heart?\" No. But my father is, sometimes. And it turns out he is reading this blog. Hello, Dad."},
{"title": "Horoscopes for the Dead", "date": "Friday, August 20, 2021", "text": "Billy Collins is such a relaxing poet. His poems are deft and wise, sometimes sweet, often funny, and I love his meandering imagination. Sometimes they are very deep; he just eases you into those depths, and then you find yourself dug in. In the title poem of Horoscopes for the Dead (Random House, 2012, paperback), the dead is a Pisces (like me), and the poem leaves the superficiality of the newspaper horoscope in an upward thrust at the end.Ah, that connects somehow (the blue, the upper atmosphere) with the lovely cover image by Eric Sloane, A Republic Seabee (ca. 1940). And I see that even major, bestselling poets revise their work. The opening line in the Pen America version is, \"Every morning since you fell down on the face of the earth.\" In the book, it is, \"Every morning since you disappeared for good,\" adding some mystery and evasion.But that isn't what I started out to tell you. I was looking for August, for evidence of my own recent, comic theory that August will appear in any poet's book if you look for it. Nope. It's April, not August, but at least a named month (and one starting with \"A\"!) in \"Cemetery Ride,\" and a copper bicycle appears again (suggesting autobiography), and cows (a coincidence in my reading/writing), and dogs (a coincidence with the Dog Days of August*, so we got there in a meandering way, after all.) \"Grave,\" the very first poem in the book, is about a sweet visit to his parents' \"joined grave,\" and \"Cemetery Ride\" brings us round to a general appreciation of cemeteries and the dead.Speaking of revision (digression above), there is actually a poem called \"Revision,\" and it has cows in it! It's about how revision might not be as wise as leaving things as they are, even if its a \"swaybacked\" cow.     I was too young then to see     that she was staring into the great mystery     just as intently as her sisters,     her gorgeous, brown and white, philosophic sisters.(I hope this poem is about exactly what it seems to be: cows, revision, as of poems. Not some reconsideration of a woman poet of the past...meaning we've all been compared to cows again. I am choosing to take it at face value!) (And I should mention that \"Drawing You from Memory\" is very good but not relaxing, turning sharply at the end and smashing into the hard reality of a troubled relationship. It's not all easy, fun, pleasant poems in Billy Collins's kitchen.)\"My Hero,\" though, is a fine revision of the fable of the tortoise and the hare. Ah, but it, too, is about letting things be as they are, not having to win the race. \"Bread and Butter\"--with dogs again, plus the idea of thank-you notes from an earlier poem (\"Thank-You Notes\")--seems to affirm this in the last two stanzas:     And now something tells me I should make     more out of all that, moving down     and inward where a poem is meant to go.     But this time I want to leave it be,     the sea, the stars, the dogs, and the clouds--     just written down, folded in fours, and handed to my host.Don't revise too much, don't go too deep. And now I take you to my favorite couplet, a serious question with a funny pun in it:     Who said I had to always play     the secretary of the interior?Yes! That's the perfect phrase for a poet, \"secretary of the interior.\" It's from the poem \"Returning the Pencil to Its Tray,\" and it's like Prospero laying his magic aside at the end of The Tempest to resume his real life before he dies.*And lest that sound too sad, here are some sweet dogs in Dog Days, with art by Yun Gee Bradley, at Escape Into Life, and some poems with dogs in them, and more dog art, also at EIL."},
{"title": "Hinge", "date": "Thursday, August 19, 2021", "text": "Another wonderful book by Molly Spencer, Hinge (Southern Illinois University Press, 2020). Its eerie cover is a doorknob in the shape of a human hand. When I woke this morning at 3:33, something I do, I came down to read the rest of it, begun yesterday, falling asleep again with this hand at my breast. A bad dream woke me, seeming in keeping with the darker themes of the book, the Grimm fairy tales woven in, the myth of Persephone and Demeter, the body wracked by lupus, the cold houses, one full of moths...Reading If the house and Hinge together in August was good. It reminded me of Molly Spencer's big year of awards: 2019--with the Brittingham Prize for If the House and the Crab Orchard Series in Poetry Open Competition Award for Hinge, written first, published second, after 100 rejections, which should inspire us all!And, of course, I found August: \"The slow ambush / of August / heat...\" on p. 31. Late in the book, the gorgeous \"Elegy\" has August in it, the speaker addressing her former self:                           Girl I was,     you keep asking the way     fledglings beg at an empty nest. Go back     to your shirtless, half-boy, August afternoons.     Go to your footpath, your hill of shade.I'm glad of the helpful notes at the end (as I always am, when poets provide them!), with sources for epigraphs and imbedded lines, erasure, overall intertextuality that engages me in other poets' work as well as these poems, a great reminder of community and, perhaps, especially given the myths and tales, the collective unconscious. And/or maybe I'm just validating my dream on the couch...I was struck by \"Most Accidents Occur at Home,\" its Adam-and-Eve, Cain-and-Abel resonance in contemporary domesticity. \"Nobody tells you this: / Every day is a creation story.\" And how \"Girl with Book and Angel\" is a kind of annunciation story. Then \"Girl with House and Lost Boys\" brings us Peter Pan, Neverland. Childhood, darkened by later experience, rolls over these poems until the light breaks in, and luck, and resilience.Also, though I am immersed just in the reading now, and in things going on in my own family life, these are the poems that make me want to write again. Thank you, Molly Spencer, for these books and your little-room-for-poetry-and-the-writing-life blog, the stanza, of the past."},
{"title": "If the house", "date": "Wednesday, August 18, 2021", "text": "Molly Spencer is a poet I've admired for a long time, and I loved reading If the house (University of Wisconsin Press, 2019) here in August, for the Sealey Challenge. Of course, I encountered August in actual lines of the poems! First, in the poem \"Bridging\": \"You've been trying to get this right--August / evening, ten o'clock and the sky / still rinsed with light.\" Gorgeous, huh? And again at the end, the very last poem, \"I Talk Myself through the Facts of Each Day,\" and I must include the fact that I have just picked peaches in my parents' back yard!     Here is a peach     fat in my hand. This means     it must be August.Indeed. I loved these quiet, lonesome poems. It's a sad, gray book with snow in it, sorrow, the loving care of children, and the wisdom (and beauty) of not crying over spilled milk.I found other coincidences beyond August. Goldenrod will be blooming here soon, and I love these lines from \"Meadow / A Reckoning\":     Girl, you have burned yourself out. Goldenrod     Rusts at your edges, the dazed sky sharpens     Its blunted blade toward blue.As I read these lines during the August evening, in the poem \"Disclosures / If you are aware of any nuisance animals, such as crows, chickens, or barking dogs,\" \"The crows will go on gathering / inside you,\" batches of crows were flying overhead, congregating in the north by northwest...very Hitchcockian.I loved the two poems, \"Conversation with Glass and Joist\" and \"Conversation with Windows and Green,\" that show the basic incompatibility of a married couple. The silence, the distance. By chance, I had just seen Aloha, and its scenes with a silent husband (sometimes with subtitles) and his yearning wife, though these involve some comedy, and Spencer's poems have no such comic relief; instead, a gripping intensity.The sadness is relieved by fierce honesty. Titles still laden with sorrow begin to quiver with hope: \"As if life can go on as it has\" and \"Even so, the first bird.\" I woke before the first bird to tell you so."},
{"title": "Patient Zero", "date": "Tuesday, August 17, 2021", "text": "Recently I dreamed I lived in a waterworld, and now this cover!--art by Jeremy Miranda, Searching--for Patient Zero by Tomás Q. Morín (Copper Canyon, 2017). And I kept intersecting with the book as I read along. The title poem, \"Patient Zero,\" which makes you think of AIDS, or Covid, or the movie Contagion, is really about love as \"a worried, old heart / disease,\" quoting Son House lyrics to lay out a theory about humans and animals stricken with \"something...divine and endless.\" Love.The book includes a translation of Pablo Neruda's poem \"Calle a Calle,\" that begins, \"So I am tired of being a man.\" It did seem in a different voice in a way. A dreamed voice? An underwater voice? In \"At the Supermarket,\" the speaker imagines himself into a Rockwell painting with others in line with him at the cashier, leading to the fabulous closing lines: \"the girl totals and totals what we owe, / as we inch and inch toward the infinite.\" [Intersection--I have a supermarket poem, too! \"Grocery Store at Night.\"] In the wonderful \"Carità Americana,\" he retells a Roman story about milk and generosity to include cows and a cowbird [where I intersect again with poems of my own] and pity, which may be a kind of love.There is a remarkable long poem called \"Sing Sing\" about a prisoner who keeps drafting a letter to her parole board. In it, I learn that \"Sing Sing\" must come from \"the Sint Sinck / tribe who fished and camped // the shores...\" Indeed, looking further, I find that Sint Sinck means \"stone upon stone,\" and are the white stones of the famous prison at Ossining, New York.I connected again and again with poems in Patient Zero, but I'll leave you with some lines from \"Stargazing\":        ...There was a way     I moved then, prehistoric     you might call it, that I don't move now,     not since life taught me patience     never filled a hungry stomach or slowed     the sure fist of a bully...That rang so true, and made me sad, until I went back to the first line, to track the prehistoric, \"I used to walk like a sloth,\" and smiled to think of the sloth in Zooptopia."},
{"title": "Only As the Day is Long", "date": "Monday, August 16, 2021", "text": "Only As the Day is Long, by Dorianne Laux (Norton, 2019), is a big book. It had a bookmark* in it, so it's part new read, part re-read, and I've read many of these poems earlier, too; she's a poet I've admired for a long time. The bookmark was at \"The Orgasms of Organisms,\" about insects mating, and as I read it, cicadas were loud around, my husband reading in a hammock hung from our sweetgum tree and half-dismantled swingset-fort contraption left by the previous owners of our house. We are living a long, perfect summer day together. I've been reading and weeding. He's got the electric mower charged and parked out here as if he's going to mow. It's still Sunday...but I won't finish this book till Monday, as I can read \"only as the day is long\" and then no more.*a Jesse White, Secretary of State, Illinois Center for the book bookmark!How I love \"Savages,\" about four boys reading poetry on the floor of a bookstore. \"Democracy\" gives me her political insight: \"You can feel it now: why people become Republicans,\" but she isn't one, evidently. There are poems about the homeless, the poor, the troubled and disadvantaged, the hard-working class. Waitresses, nurses.There are poems about trees. \"Cello\" is also about love, music, transformation...and about \"a dead tree...fall[ing] into the arms / of a living tree,\" coupled then forever. Poems about birds, starling, raven, crow. About men, beloved, remembered, soldiers, musicians, Mick Jagger, Philip Levine.I find my coincidence, the phrase \"Against the insomnia of August,\" while reading, awake, in August. I find many a favorite stanza. Here's one, from \"Late-Night TV\":     We know nothing about how it all works,     how we end up in one bed or another,     speak one language instead of the others,     what heat draws us to our life's work     or keeps us from a dream until it's nothing     but a blister we scratch in our sleep.Often I say to myself, I am never lonely, or hardly ever, I say today, Blue Monday in the blog, but yesterday afternoon, I was strangely lonely, and called some friends, and turned again to poetry, this book, an open-hearted, yearning, sometimes lonely book, and it helped.I saved the last section, the new poems, for today, Monday, Sealey Challenge, Day 16. But yesterday I let the long day's shadows fall over me on the weathered wooden glider, softened by an ivy-print comforter (since I can't find any glider cushions at Bed, Bath, and Beyond...and don't really shop anymore, and now this is just like a diary, this reading/writing practice, sorry...), and I rested.Ah, but the new poems, read early on this Blue Monday, are mother poems, death-of-the-mother poems, beautiful with complicated grief. Piano music poems, for the mother played. With touches of bedroom slippers, a metal collander, Route 66 as the Mother Road. Another favorite stanza:     There will always be     silence, no matter     how long someone     has wept against     the side of a house,     bare forearms pressed     to the shingles.And here, in \"Letter to My Dead Mother,\" is a couplet I recognize as similar to something my own mother has told me:     You told me when you were 72     You still felt 25 behind your eyes."},
{"title": "A Plumber's Guide to Light", "date": "Sunday, August 15, 2021", "text": "Oh, my! A Plumber's Guide to Light, by Jesse Bertron (Rattle, 2021) was the perfect book to read today! I read it right before church--Zoom Church. It had occurred to me when I woke up that maybe I should have saved Holy Magic for today because of the word \"holy,\" but instead it's a holy Random Coinciday in the blog because1) today's Zoom Church readings were from 2 Chronicles 34:8-12, 14-19 about repairing the house of the Lord and \"On Houses\" by Kahlil Gibran2) A Plumber's Guide to Light is all about the building trades (and so much more!)3) one of the workers in the book is actually named Antonio, like my actual husband, who is a carpenter with electrician and plumber skills, too, as well as being a visual artist, the way Jesse Bertron is a laborer as well as a poet!I connect with so much in this book! In the very first poem, \"Shorty,\" the speaker does his work \"with Shorty sitting / on a  five-gallon primer bucket\" supervising. Same scene described to me by my husband, doing some labor with a retired but still licensed plumber at hand for his expertise. I've heard the refrain \"Good enough for government work,\" from the poem \"Slop,\" repeated by members of the extended family. And I give you these great lines from \"Slop\" (in addition to the ones about shoddy work on a toilet that mean \"when the wax ring goes, // a little water mixed with human shit will leak onto the floor / with every flush\"):     Never buy a house built on a Friday, is something Jacob said     on a Friday, as he walked away from a bad solder.     The human race: built on a Friday!     That's what Genesis says--a book of the Bible that I love,     starring as it does an expert working at a speed     that may invite disaster.See what I mean? Perfect for a Sunday. And also a perfect blend of humor, reality of the working world, and religious philosophy.I connect with the actual labor, having helped my husband lift and move heavy things (scary on the stairs), sand hardwood floors, grout bathroom tile, and paint porches. \"Antonio loves to work...\" begins  a line from the poem \"Orientation,\" but when I told my husband he should read this book, he said, \"I don't like plumbing much.\" (He's working on a bathroom right now.)And there are beautiful, devastating poems about the mother here, losing her memory. In the poem \"Dust,\" the mother forgetting her plan to \"end her life\" before her mind gets worse was strangely comforting to me. And \"Telephone Crew,\" with the mother having to fend off the archer who came \"with the crew...to shoot an arrow tied to high-gauge fishing line / above the trees, and use that line to string the cable // to her house,\" was altogether marvelous. First, who knew? How ingenious! Second, what a strong woman.So! I love this book! I leave you with two central stanzas from \"There Was No Assignment but There Will Be a Test\":     It has been a hard year, so I want to tell my neighbor's kid     that the most important part of a story     is someone you love will ask for what they need     and you'll fail them in a way you have prepared for all your life.     The only way you'll see out of the cell     of your regret will be     to hold the splintered thread of the everyday     as if it were spun gold.(See spun gold electrical wire above. Plus a toilet wax ring. Sigh....)"},
{"title": "Holy Magic", "date": "Saturday, August 14, 2021", "text": "Holy Magic, by Priscilla Long, is another fine book from MoonPath Press in Tillamook, Oregon! The poems are linked by color and light--with epigraphs and section headings that reinforce this--and there are helpful notes at the end, which I always appreciate. The poems have great details of not just of color and light, but also of objects, foliage, fabric, history...and our shameful history. As a kind of summary, I give you this title--\"Words Referring to Unspeakable Events\"--and the last four lines of that poem:     Let us speak in poems     that smoke and flame.     Let us speak to the dead     who walk among us.Another poem, \"Matisse's Radiance,\" which begins with \"London in flames\" in 1942, also situates us in beauty and silence in this stanza:     The world in war     yearns toward evening     light. Somewhere     someone pours tea.And many of the poems find the joy and celebration of color itself, list poems of what is orange or yellow, a marvelous compare/contrast poem called \"Indigo & Violet.\" It's first four lines:     Indigo's deep, black before dawn.     Violet's an evening song.     Indigo's ex is silver,     Violet's--obsidian.There is even praise for the \"Beauty of Coal\"--its color, and remembering what it was, before it was a fossil fuel.I loved, in \"Metamorphosis,\" the wonderful idea of a poem rhyming with a painting. In \"Green Air, the coincidence of the phrase, \"On this hot August day...\" as I read Holy Magic on a lovely, sunny, glorious August day, the heat actually lifted now by recent thunderstorms, a jet trail slanted in the sky, dispersing into a ghostly spinal column.There are several elegiac poems here, some to a lost sister, one, \"Nisqually Delta,\" with these lines that give us life itself, color, silence, beauty:     Great blue herons stand motionless     as icons. Gulls sail blue air. Ducks     duck into white water.Nice how ducks can do their simply ducky thing in the midst of all the holy magic!I meant to tell you yesterday, writing about Slight Faith, that MoonPath Press is in Tillamook, OR, and the marvelous coincidence that I have recently discovered Tillamook super creamy ice cream at my local Jewel in central Illinois and have some Peaches and Cream in my freezer right now!Also, that I didn't mean to dismiss AIDS as belonging to an era. Alas, it is still with us, though now people can live and thrive with HIV, and so much is better now than in the 1980s when there was so much fear, dismay, and death. I am reliving that now as I read The Great Believers, by Rebecca Makkai, revisiting neighborhoods, theatres, restaurants...remembering lost friends.The character Fiona in this book is looking back, too, from 2015 in this chapter:\"...How could she explain that this city was a graveyard? That they were walking every day through streets where there had been a holocaust, a mass murder of neglect and antipathy, that when they stepped through a pocket of cold air, didn't they understand it was a ghost, it was a boy the world had spat out?\"Fiona has lost a brother to AIDS. The book reminds me that the gay community was conflicted about testing, distrustful, naturally. My friend Mitch wanted to move to Australia to get away from the concentration camps he expected to be erected in the USA. He got as far as London and had a bit more of his theatre career before he died. Of AIDS.So there's a sad reminder and a sweet, creamy consolation for us, here on Slattern Day in the blog, where I must do some household chores interspersed with laziness and more poetry for the Sealey Challenge."},
{"title": "Slight Faith", "date": "Friday, August 13, 2021", "text": "Risa Denenberg of Slight Faith (MoonPath Press, 2018) might have slight faith in me now, as I got her book way back in 2018 intending to review it for Escape Into Life (as some of its poems were published there), and here it is, August of 2021, in my Sealey Challenge stack! That is 1) how slowly I sometimes read for reviewing 2) a stack mishap of some sort 3) evidence of the ongoing suspension of time, and 4) a wonderful coincidence because I am reading the right book at the right time!\"This is how you curl into your solace,\" says the poem \"Consolation,\" bringing me great solace, \"bidding its shell // to your mollusk, storm of sea blowing in your ear, / inexpressible pain expressed sotto voce.\" Here is \"Swimming Lesson,\" on the last day of Early Bird Lap Swim! Here, in the astonishing poem \"How Two Trees Become a Forest,\" are the lines, \"An / Afghani schoolgirl covers her head and walks to the / schoolhouse with broken windows\" which I read soon after hearing the news of the current exodus from Afghanistan of US-related people (and some Afghani interpreters), while so many must be left behind in such troubled circumstances.Here, in \"Life Forms Evolving,\" well before our current Covid crisis, are Ebola, Hep C, and HIV. Several poems take us to the sad and shocking era of AIDS, our awful losses there. A right-book-at-the-right-time thing: I'm also reading the novel The Great Believers, by Rebecca Makkei, taking me back to those worries and fears. In \"Yellow Star,\" we recall many disasters--the holocaust, the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire, the AIDS epidemic:     They didn't want to die so young     and neither did the gay boys who died in droves     at the close of the last century.From \"Abiding Winter,\" \"Truth is brutal. So much we can't recover....\"I so love \"The Outsider.\" Here's a great, straightforward stanza from that:     I'm the oddball: vegetarian lesbian poet     who celebrates Pesach to their Easter, rents instead     of owns, has never married, chooses to live alone.This poet is roaming, nomadic in \"In Search of Home.\" Another fantastic stanza:     I always depart. Things don't work out as planned.     I clash with the boss and get fired. I My lover     takes a lover. I feel hemmed in and need to escape     the hundreds of tiny holes in my heart.And I so connect with \"the worry / I've lived the wrong life\" in the poem \"On Leaving the Barn Door Open.\" I learned words from this book--\"metanoia\" (spiritual conversation), \"foraminifers\" (tiny shells that form a kind or rock, a component of chalk), \"foramen ovale\" (\"a hole / in the heart that must close at birth.\") Here is the confident, yet heartbroken voice of \"Metanoia Lost\" and of the book as a whole:     I speak god language     because people die     and god is the tongue of death.The cover is gorgeous. The Dove, No. 5 (1915) by Hilma af Klimt. My bookmark for this one is the postcard of the cover!"},
{"title": "Deathbed Sext", "date": "Thursday, August 12, 2021", "text": "In the title poem of Deathbed Sext, by Christopher Salerno (Two Sylvias Press, 2020), I learn that \"You can pay to receive / five texts a day that say, Don't forget / you are going to die.\" These days, I can't forget! And these lines got me in \"The Byronic Method\": \"When I sexted you a snorkel you sexted me a squid.\" \"When I sexted you / a telescope you sexted me the moon.\" I'm loving the variety of poems/books I'm reading for the Sealey Challenge, and the random coincidii. Last night thunder woke me up, and today it kept rolling through like tanks. In Deathbed Sext, I find battlefields and this: \"To...be woken by thunder in the middle of the night...\" (means \"You'll Never Get Back To Sleep Now\").The book starts with a shocking hit-and-run accident, the speaker of \"Headfirst,\" a boy on his bike hit by a car that drives on. Made me think of Raymond Carver's story \"A Small, Good Thing\" as adapted and interpreted in Robert Altman's film Short Cuts. But here the boy lives and presumably grows up to be a poet. There is serious stuff but also humor and wordplay, as in \"Dickinsonian Pics\": \"I heard a phone buzz when I died. / Your sext lit up the larger darkness.\" And I love the \"waltz[ing] away from what // once was monstrously male...\" that threads in and out of these poems, summed up for me in the line: \"I was sent to fetch a crescent wrench that wasn't even there.\" The futility, the performativity.And I love this closing stanza (equal time to hens, after the roosterishness above) from \"At the Farmstand During the Solar Eclipse\":     Not even noon but the entire farm     is going dark, and every last hen,     from instinct, returning to the coop.Book cover artist: Noela Kanecka (Isn't it wonderful?)"},
{"title": "Adjusting to the Lights", "date": "Wednesday, August 11, 2021", "text": "Tom C. Hunley must be exhausted! The poems in Adjusting to the Lights (Rattle, 2020) are about raising a son who is on the autism spectrum and a daughter whom he and his wife adopted when she was a teenager, whose birth mother was a heroin addict and birth father was abusive. And these are just two of the poet's four children (the bio on the back cover tells me). There's lots of trouble, worry, and stress here, to be sure, but also so much love. So much desire to protect these children. The first and last poems, like prayers, are addressed to God. Several of the poems express the wish to be a better father, but he seems like a darn good one, in the end:     I've had to give up so many      of my own dreams in order to find myself     in theirs. He does sound like any mother or father who has made the full commitment, yes, but also like a poet who's had a harder time finding time to write than most, and who seems to have written one of these poems in traffic school! Who was once a census taker! \"There was no autism box to check.\" Who tries to help his son understand \"What She Said\" as a phrase that's \"only funny in context\" and whose son has redeemed that awkward punchline forever for me now by uttering it out of context, repeatedly, in innocence!Oh, how dearly this father wants to protect his daughter from the boys who take advantage of her, from her own past. \"Her mom and I wanted her / the way sunlight and water want grass.\"The wonderful cover is of a movie theatre with people in it! The cover and the book's title relate to the poem \"The Last Time I Took My Son to the Movies,\" where they go to see Wonder, a movie about a boy with a special condition     who gets bullied until the other kids     get used to his face and learn to see     past it into his beautiful true self.In the poem, his own son gets bullied by a rude man in the seat in front of them, who doesn't understand the boy's behavior but who adjusts, and changes his seat, when the irony of the situation is made clear to him.                    But after the movie     I couldn't find that man among the faces     adjusting to the lights coming on.Wouldn't it be nice to be brave enough to apologize to each other, to forgive each other, whenever we can?"},
{"title": "A Juror Must Fold in on Herself", "date": "Tuesday, August 10, 2021", "text": "Wow, this chapbook, A Juror Must Fold in on Herself, by Kathleen McClung, a Rattle Chapbook Prize winner, was a wonderful surprise and a real tour de force of form! It's got the suspense of a courtroom drama and the necessary silence and discretion of being on a jury, along with villanelles, a pantoum, a ghazal, a sestina, a rondeau, a cento, a double sonnet, and a sonnet crown! Maybe more, my head is crammed. I don't think she wrote these in court, as we learn that the steno pads jurors take notes on get destroyed, shredded, maybe \"wire and all.\" The story of what happened, condensed, not fully told, is heartbreaking. I'll let you find the verdict. I found the coincidence that makes this a Random Coinciday in the blog--that I'm reading in August about a jury sequestered during \"those August days.\" Anyone, even a father, might get arrested, pay a fine. Anyone, even a grandmother, might spend her days at a courthouse, typing. And in this chapbook, they do! I love how everything ties together. How, in the poem \"Summons,\"                  ...I seek peace,     a juror sworn to silence on this case,     this endless trial--victims and police     and video, an endless loop of loss     we twelve appraise alone. Grave calculus.McClung's choice of repeating forms, tightly rhyming forms, connected stanzas is just perfect for her content."},
{"title": "Made To Explode", "date": "Monday, August 9, 2021", "text": "The first poem is about Tater Tots, and the second poem is about \"buying weapons,\" so I definitely encountered the unexpected in Made to Explode, by Sandra Beasley (W.W. Norton, 2021). And then it all came together in \"Einstein, Midnight,\" one of several prose poems in the book, in the sentence, \"Anything, in the right hands, can be made to explode.\" Many details of history here, including how the poet's personal history intersects with American history. In \"My Whitenesses,\" I learned what the epithet cracker means and found these three pithy lines:     My performative strip     of self, still     trashing up the place.Jam-packed with meaning. And in \"Monticello Peaches,\" a poem about Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings and her brothers, I learned the difference between cling and freestone peaches. It's hard to bear the poem \"Black Death Spectacle,\" about Emmett Till. \"Kiss Me,\" about Ruth Bader Ginsburg attending the Cole Porter musical Kiss Me, Kate, makes me never want to see it, alas, and to wish again she were still alive. Oh, how \"Winter Garden Photograph\" hit me in the heart, with the words \"Carl died. Life is over\" written on a calendar that survives grief. And \"Lazarus\" is a glorious poem in the grand tradition of cat poems that makes me miss my cat, all my cats. Ah, so it is a Blue Monday in the blog, and another Poetry Someday in pursuit of the Sealey Challenge."},
{"title": "A Day in Boyland", "date": "Sunday, August 8, 2021", "text": "Over time, I've been reading all the work of Jessy Randall, and I'm glad to be reading her very first collection, A Day in Boyland (Ghost Road Press, 2007, with that wonderful cover design by Sonya Unrein) this August for the Sealey Challenge. This book has been patiently waiting in its wrapper on my poetry book stack till now!First time through, I read with sheer joy, taking nary a note--nary a written note but plenty of mental notes and feathery notes on my heart. Next time through, I paused in the midst of my laughter or awe to take small notes--these are mostly short poems--so I could tell you some things about why I love this book and Jessy Randall. It's all the feeling, I guess, and the wild, sweet imagination! Plus the humor. It's the childlike acceptance and honest tears. Yes, because I've laughed in delight at so much of her later work, this couplet from \"Phone Words\" surprised me: \"I thought I wanted people to be sad / like me, but now I don't like that either.\" Sad like her. I wouldn't have guessed...but, yes, of course, it makes perfect sense now that I've read A Day in Boyland. There are love poems and heartbreak poems, silly poems and sad poems, and back-to-love poems. There's a narrative arc, from friends who are boys in childhood, to actual boyfriends (and a boyfriend parade!), to a crucial first love (the one you lose, alas), to finding your true love, to maternal love. It's glorious!--all the more glorious because of the suffering along the way. Gently, humorously shared suffering.Example of her wild imagination, the first stanza of \"Heart\":     I wrote a poem about your heart     but it was really my heart.     All the words were backwards     and covered in spinach.But another example could be \"Three Martians Learn to Make Marshmallows,\" a celebration and send-up of science fiction. Or \"The Couch,\" a wonderful what-if? poem:     Imagine if all the couches you ever sat on     were gathered together into one enormous room.     And what if the people who sat there with you     were also brought in?There was loneliness in yesterday's book, Night Angler, by Geffrey Davis, of a different kind, and here in Jessy Randall's A Day in Boyland there is \"The Zone of Loneliness,\" her own kind--though in it I find books we have in common, Einstein's Dreams and Clan of the Cave Bear, so waves of my own lonely loneliness of youth wash over me, along with the awareness that it is different now, and I've always liked solitude and often said, \"I am never lonely.\" (But someday I may be.)I liked reading the wedding poems! (My daughter is getting married next May!) I remembered \"The Great Disappointment of the Honeymoon,\" a secret I'll leave you to discover on your own. And I can't wait till her next book comes out. Mathematics for Ladies: Poems on Women in Science, forthcoming in 2022! Find links to some of these poems here!"},
{"title": "Night Angler", "date": "Saturday, August 7, 2021", "text": "Alongside these books for the Sealey Challenge, I had been reading The Writer's Library, and in the last interview in that, Russell Banks says that \"books open the door to a larger world. I don't read to escape. I read to enter. To go somewhere, which is different. A very different motivation, I think.\" I agree, a different motivation, and, while I did some escape reading during the pandemic's lockdown period, mostly I read to enter other worlds. Reading poetry gives me an intense, intimate, profound look at other lives through various doorways.Reading Night Angler, by Geffrey Davis, I enter the life of a tender father, devoted to his family, who is also ambivalent toward his own father. (Violence, addiction, desertion.) There are several poems called \"The Night Angler,\" meaning fishing but also navigating the darkness. In one, addressed to his son, there's this aching iteration:     Dear Boy: In the beginning     father was a fear I wanted     to call love.That gets to the heart of everything, I think! Water, rivers, fishing weave throughout this book, and love, and so does the song, \"You Are My Sunshine,\" which my mother sang to me. In \"Pleasures of Place,\" I also encounter  the familiar--places members of my family have settled in the past or present, Pennsylvania and Oregon, but not Arkansas, where the poet speaks from now, but here's the month of August, with his Dear Boy spinning in it, and into my world:                              As if on cue, you come     bombing out the backdoor, two flashlights in hand, and run     deep into the August dark, where you invent a dazzling     dance that frames your body in this turning I can't describe.I am grateful and glad to witness this joy, and sad to enter the reality and woe of \"Self-Portrait as a Dead Black Boy,\" an elegy for more than one Black man. But how else can I learn?"},
{"title": "Sweet Two-fer", "date": "Friday, August 6, 2021", "text": "John Sweet sweetly sent me a stack of his books when I featured him at Escape Into Life. I hoped then to read some of them this month for the Sealey Challenge, and it's happening! The beautifully designed chapbook famine (Leaf Press (2004), editor Ursula Vaira) has a gorgeous cover image, \"New Shadows,\" via Artemy Levedev. It opens with a missing child, postered to the telephone poles of a small town and \"the fact that love cannot / exist without fear.\" So it's a sad, dark book, reminding us     how easy it was to destroy     everything we had     how much it felt     like breathingBut if things are ugly here     and not even dirty white light     spilling from magritte's sky     can make this great artstill, I can't look away. This reminds me of what Wren Hanks was doing in Lily-Livered and what my husband does as a painter: show us the darkness, trouble, pain so intensely that we don't look away, can't look away, and then, facing it, we might do something. And also what the poet Bruce Weigl said in his  poem, \"The Impossible\": \"Say it clearly and you make it beautiful, no matter what.\"I'm reading famine on Friday afternoon and in \"the sky enormous over the human cathedral\" it's \"friday afternoon in / the house of empty truths.\" A little later, \"a random progression\" answers my hope that something will be done with \"the knowledge that / nothing will be done.\" Nothing will be done about war, famine, rape, murder, the abuse of children in these dark Sweet poems. But the poems are so tender in the midst of despair, since \"poetry is a useless weapon.\" Still, I feel the presence of hope, as in \"the weight of the known world\":     and what i have     in this world are the     people i love and the ways     that i make them angry     the ways that     we fail each other     such simple acts of faithAh, so, of course, the second chapbook I've picked from the stack is bastard faith (scarspublications, 2017), and it's dark, too, maybe moreso. But it has this beautiful title in it: \"one of us, speaking without bitterness to the other.\" I was thinking of that, walking home from a public hearing yesterday evening, how I'd like to speak quietly, without bitterness, with some of those who testified, to see, though we might disagree, where we do agree.Today, I had a conversation with someone I do agree with (that we should all get vaccinated, if we can, and wear masks) about how shocking it is that decent people who love their kids don't care about other people. But here in \"one for the drowning man\" is a couplet of dark truth: \"no one here is ever truly sorry / for anyone else's pain.\"Oh, and what a surprise to find this couplet/question!:     your job is to map the     city of masks, but where to begin?I'd say that makes this a Random Coinciday in the blog. Yes, bastard faith is a dark book that ends     why do you keep     begging for the truth if it's     never what you want to hear?after delivering lots of hard truths. But also this golden nugget of hope: \"not every noble idea / has to be a lie.\" Feast or famine, how Sweet it is."},
{"title": "In the months of my son's recovery", "date": "Thursday, August 5, 2021", "text": "Today's book opens with Kate Daniels's wonderful song of herself, \"Her Barbaric Yawp,\" referencing Walt Whitman's song of himself via epigraph: \"I sound my barbaric yawp over the roofs of the world.\" It's celebration and lament, praise for the aging woman who misses her juice. Great, bold fun, terrific honesty. The honesty continues in the addict's story within In the Months of My Son's Recovery (Louisiana State University Press, 2019), though I should mention her disclaimer via A Note to Readers: \"These poems are narrated by a character similar, but not identical, to myself, and represent other characters and situations that may be archetypal, emanating from many aspects of and perspectives on the current opioid epidemic.\" In the center of the poem titled \"In the Midst of the Heroin Epidemic\" is the crux of it all:                                                           Addicts destroy     themselves--that's just where we start. And why     they might have wanted to, or if it was an accident     is beside the point... The aftermath is what's at stake.A partial narrative is told just in titles: \"Detox,\" \"Getting Clean,\" \"Relapse,\" \"Recovery.\" Poems about meetings, support groups. While it is \"her\" story, and his, her son's, uniquely their own, it is also like every other story of addiction I've ever heard. We know what happens. If only we could stop it! We can; we can't. From \"The Brothers,\" this:     Addiction is a family disease. It infects     each member and distorts their stories. It lives     to breech the boundaries of given texts,     and to change old narratives and destroy     plots you thought were set in stone.This is a heartbreaking and heartbreakingly familiar story--the addict who steals from his own family to support his habit. The endless worry and stress. And then such a stunning tribute to \"The Daughter-in-Law,\" who climbs through a window to get this man to rehab.And there's more woe--breast cancer, divorce. What amazing strength and resilience, patience and liberation. To get to \"Detachment.\" To get to \"Yes.\""},
{"title": "Postcolonial Love Poem", "date": "Wednesday, August 4, 2021", "text": "I haven't seen much of the Olympics, but I did watch some exciting basketball. And there's exciting basketball in Postcolonial Love Poem (Graywolf Press, 2020), by Natalie Diaz, winner of the Pulitzer Prize. In \"Run'n'Gun,\" she writes that she \"learned to play ball on the rez, on outdoor courts where the sky was our ceiling. Only a tribal kid's shot has an arc made of sky.\" It's a prose poem in sections; here's one:\"We played bigger and bigger until we began winning. And we won by doing what all Indians before us had done against their bigger, whiter opponents--we became coyotes and rivers, and we ran faster than their fancy kicks could, up and down the court, game after game. We became the weather--we blew by them, we rained buckets, we lit up the gym with our moves.\"The river runs through this book. \"The First Water is the Body\" begins, \"The Colorado River is the most endangered river in the United States--also, it is a part of my body.\" Later, the \"I\" becomes a \"we.\" \"We carry the river, its body of water, in our body.\" In the poem called \"exhibits from The American Water Museum,\" water is like language: \"I am fluent in water. Water is fluent in my body-- / it spoke my body into existence.\"Love poems wind in and out. Animals. Snake, wolf, crane, coyote, bull, tiger, horse, yellow jacket, all the animals on the ark. More basketball. In \"The Mustangs,\" her brother is a high school basketball star; the team is beloved by the whole community. \"We ran up and down the length of our lives, all of us, lit by the lights of the gym, toward freedom--we Mustangs. On those nights, we were forgiven for all we would ever do wrong.\"It was a beautiful day to read this book outside. I love August, its pure summer feel, its poignant, back-to-school-soon, summer's-almost-over-feel---but it isn't! Summer goes on and on, long past school. And now August is the Sealey Challenge for me, a poetry book a day, a lushness of reading in the green afternoon, the coneflowers blooming, phlox, round two of golden lilies, the oregano flower-headed and leaning out into the lawn. I love how I can read these poems to learn, to experience beauty and desire in someone else's language, culture, voice. I'm reading for joy!--though, yes, I encounter grief--and for knowledge. I learn that \"Manhattan is a Lenape Word.\" I learn the \"Top Ten Reasons Why Indians Are Good at Basketball.\"And what a thrill to find Kearney, Nebraska in a poem, a town I lived in as a child, and the sandhill cranes. In a heartbreaking brother poem with a dismantled Polaroid camera. What a book! And what is a sky hook? Ah, now I know!"},
{"title": "Finna", "date": "Tuesday, August 3, 2021", "text": "FINNA, by Nate Marshall (One World, 2020), begins with a \"landless acknowledgment\" containing this line: \"we lost the land we were custodians over before i was a twinkle in the eye of a twinkle in the eye of a twinkle in the eye.\" I love how I get lost in that. I wanted Finna the first time I saw its title, its cover, and I'm so glad to be reading it now for the Sealey Challenge, Day 3. My son wrote \"finna\" on the window of his car. I wanted to learn from these poems what \"finna\" means. Thank you, Nate Marshall! The poem \"FINNA,\" an on-beyond-definition poem, teaches me     finna comes from the southern phrase fixing to     like i come from my southern grandmothers & finna     is this word that reminds me about everything next.     even when i've been a broken boy i know i'm fixiing to     get fixed.I'm learning lots more, too. For instance, that there are lots of Nate Marshalls out there--one a white supremacist--and several poems about these namesakes. In one, these heartbreaking stanzas:     1 time a dude i knew hit me up relieved & shaken     when his timeline told him Nate Marshall had been murdered     but it was a different me somewhere on the North Side.     definitely peace to that Nate Marshall     & to his people who would have been relieved     had i been the news article instead of their sweet, beautiful boy.I love the poem \"step.\" It begins:     learn this or get out my house     is how mama started my dance lesson     when i was a boy.And it has this stanza of possible other names:in Chicago we call it steppin'but perhaps every Blackneighborhood has some versionthey call swing or bop or hand dance or hustle.The book is full of Chicago, where I used to live, where I visited this weekend and played volleyball on the beach with old friends, family, and new friends, who fed me, fed all of us, like family. This couplet resonates for me now: \"but fam, understand, if you treat the fam / like strangers, then you a stranger, fam.\" I am shy, but no longer a stranger.I love how some of the poems in FINNA are sideways; some of the stanzas are upside-down. Another definition poem begins     scruples                      is the word i tell anyone who asks     for my favorite. what sounded     to me like a doctor's instrument was just a     name for the hesitation respectability births.And the poem \"slave grammar\" defies definition:                                           whole time     i'm writing this down its obsoleting     itself. whole time we talking we ain't got     no dictionary we guessing the spelling     we deciphering the phrases through     our slurs we slurring like we ain't sure until     we murmur a sure vow.This book has great titles. One example: \"welcome to how the hell i talk.\" Today I went with my mom to a neuropsychology appointment. Today I read the poem \"what can be said\" in FINNA, that ends:     once Alzheimer's does what it do     you never really have conversations     it's more a man becomes a poem     a lot of repetition & love with something     indecipherable in between.I think today is/was Tuesday, but \"wednesday feels like a funeral\" is the poem that says     what i know      of hate     i learned early     & then every     day after that.I might have a favorite poem in this book. It tells a story and explains the world to me; it's called \"let me put it to you like this fam.\" It gives me a new golden rule: \"who you believe in is a matter / of who you mattered to.\" And it's referenced in the title poem, too, a poem of praise and hope     & it's finna     take on this wide world     with a whole slang for possibility.As I recall it, and this was many years ago, Richard Jones and his new wife missed their flight to Paris, and the plane crashed, killing everyone. In Paris (Tebot Bach*, 2021), on a later visit, everything is calm; it's a beautiful city, filled with history, poets, painters, composers, sculptors, ex-patriots, and flâneurs, even the Little Prince. You'll find conversational rambles here, sweet interactions with other tourists; quiet, inward moments. In \"Brancusi\":     Consolation is not what I came here for,     but it is better than anything I might have wanted     before I came to Paris.I might say the same about the book, Paris! I just spent the weekend--of Lollapalooza--in Chicago, seeing a play, plus family and friends, roaming my old neighborhood on a beautiful, breezy summer day. We, too, were flâneurs, stopping at a sidewalk cafe for mojitos, perfectly muddled with mint. How lovely to visit a city that, because I once lived there, still reminds me of home. How consoling, after witnessing the crowds, actually to come home! In Rodin's gardens, Richard Jones misses his own...Playwright August Strindberg, alas, \"could find no solace.\"     He came searching and found nothing---     Paris almost did him in.In contrast, in \"Strindberg and Miller,\" Henry Miller did, and became brave enough to face the future by accepting the present. Look at this:     But in Paris,     Miller came to understand     freedom is obtained by the acceptance of suffering     and by giving suffering meaning.     He foresaw the future of poetry,     the terrible day when poets     would deliberately make themselves unintelligible     and renounce their power to move us.     Such poetry, he said, is worthless,     a betrayal of trust.     The world, Miller insisted,     hangs on the poet's every word;     the place of renewal is the heart, he said,     and there the poet must anchor himself.Richard Jones does anchor himself in the intelligible, via the heart. His Paris is full of photographers and philosophers, booksellers and bakers, children and old men, bicycles and boats. The play I saw, after the mojito, was called Riding the Bicycle. I love these lines from \"'The Drunken Boat.'\"     The bicycle woke me to the fact     I was walking Saint-Germain's winding streets     a little bit like a drunken boat myself,     adrift on a sea of reveries.I'd tell you more, but it's late, I'm sleepy (I'm drinking wine to make sure I sleep), and, as Richard would tell me...     ...in our numbered days     we will never finish     all the work we are put here to do.(And this is only Day #2, of the Sealey Challenge.)* \"tebot bach\" means \"little teapot\"!"},
{"title": "Lily-Livered", "date": "Monday, August 2, 2021", "text": "Here I am, as predicted (based on current trends in my sleep patterns), to report on Lily-Livered, by Wren Hanks, a wonderful chapbook from Driftwood Press, first up in my pursuit of the Sealey Challenge to read a poetry book a day in August. The fabulous cover art is by Denis Sarazhin, cover design by Sally Franckowiak, and book design by James McNulty. I loved finding an interview with the author at the end, conducted by Jerrod Schwarz, co-founder of the press. I learned so much from both the poems and the interview. \"I don't know how to exist as a trans person,\" says the poet in the interview, \"even one with a good deal of privilege, without wondering whether I'm safe every time I'm out in public.\" I think of one of the poems in the book, the last one, as the \"safe\" poem. Titled \"Transiversary,\" as are several in the book, honoring the date the poet began medical transition with testosterone, it begins, \"The therapist is safe\" and lists what else is safe, and I sigh with relief and awe at the poet's resilience and triumph. I love the poet's handling of form and content--how they interact--all through: repeated lines, resonating as in a sonnet crown, plus great wild rambling moments and prose poems; rich and risky. And I love what the poet says about \"speaker\" in the interview: \"The speaker of the poem has a job to do, and it's not the same job as if you were telling this same story at a party or a friend's couch. In my opinion, the speaker exists to serve the poem's truth, not to relay every detail of a moment just as you remember them.\" Lots of other good advice here, too. Lily-Livered begins with an epigraph from Macbeth, from a moment where a scared boy brings a message during battle, and ends courageous, compassionate, and, I hope, at last, safe."},
{"title": "Almost August", "date": "Friday, July 30, 2021", "text": "It's almost August, and I'm still behind in all things poetry-related but so enjoying each day, each moment of life in summer. Today, I did post a review of What Happens is Neither, by Angela Narciso Torres, at Escape Into Life, and another review is coming soon, August 4, of Dialogues with Rising Tides, by Kelli Russell Agodon. Indeed, my fond (meaning both affectionate and foolish) hope is again to attempt the Sealey Challenge, reading a poetry book a day in August, and posting about it here. My friend Kim enjoyed that last year, as did several of the poets who found themselves here, and I love the whole idea of the challenge. But can I do it this year? Today, pursuant to the challenge, I did read a chapbook in advance, as I will be otherwise occupied on August 1 (volleyball, friends). Still, I may post in the middle of the night.I'm swimming again, which is meditative, a wonderful body-mind blend. I continue to be busy with many details. I think I have a weensy bit of what they are calling \"re-entry anxiety,\" though I feel calm most of the time, and not at all troubled by wearing a mask into all businesses, even if others aren't, but my particular county is a current hotspot and masks are being required again, not just recommended, so maybe we'll see more...masks...or rude resistance, alas. The schools will be requiring masks, a relief!Also this weekend, I'll be seeing a new play, in a theatre, in a big city, socially distanced, in a mask when I walk in. I'll be eating in restaurants--ack!--again, masked when I walk in, unmasked when I eat and drink. So far, I've only done that outside or via takeout.To calm myself in preparation for all this, I am reading and writing in the sun and breeze, doing small household chores, packing in stages. To stay calm in a general way, I have been attentive to each moment, and also oddly color-coordinated. That is, I stack my recently-read books on the stairs in color-coordinated stacks. These stacks can be moved to some bookshelves-in-waiting when winter comes, and the stairs get stacked with small bins of hats, scarves, mittens, and gloves. As I pick each book now, I choose a bookmark to match, mainly via color or design but sometimes also via content. A book with a woman's face on the cover may get my Edna St. Vincent Millay bookmark from the American Writers Museum in Chicago. Right now I'm reading The Writer's Library, by Nancy Pearl and Jeff Schwager, about books that various authors love, pulled from the \"Yellow...Is It Me You're Looking For?\" display at the library, and the bookmark I chose for this says, \"I have always imagined that Paradise will be a kind of library.\" --Jorge Luis Borges. I do like that idea of a heaven. And I hope to hold body & mind together...in the meantime. By swimming. A heaven in body-mind."},

My last post, in early April, was mostly about March, and time still feels suspended. I wrote a poem a day in April, as planned & hoped, and I have continued to read books of poetry but am way behind in my reviewing,* as that takes concentration, re-reading, and a clear mind. I'm also reading fiction, nonfiction, essays, comics, and letters as a kind of escape as well as a way to focus. I'm walking to work. I'm swimming laps again, as this year the pool opened! I feel good but weird.I guess I'm surprised that coming out of Covid isolation was somehow harder than being in. But why?** I'm not scared, just wary. I worked from home till June 1, 2020, and have worked masked at the workplace ever since. I'm vaccinated and go unmasked with other vaccinated people, friends and family I trust. I still wear a mask to the grocery store, though many customers, cashiers, and other employees don't. Cases (and deaths) went way down where I live but are on the uptick again. I accompany my parents to medical appointments, where people all wear masks in healthcare settings. I was part of a masked theatre audience and will be again. But I walk to work unmasked, and it is so nice to see people's faces again.My poetry life continues in slow motion, and sometimes I forget about it. I have publications forthcoming, but I have to look at my lists to recall them. I make notes about poems to write, and wrote one for a particular contest & deadline to spur myself on. I write poems in my head as I walk but fail to write them down. I haven't pulled my chalkboard back up from the basement to write small daily poems for social media and people at my porch in real life. Forgive me.* I did review a chapbook by Keith Taylor, but chapbooks are short!**Probably because I am shy and an introvert. Staying inside wasn't a problem for me."},
{"title": "Long Hard March", "date": "Friday, April 9, 2021", "text": "Prescient?: My mom in fur with a cane, Cemetery Walk 2009 It was a long hard March,and now evidently it’s April, as the poems and flowers prove. On March 6, mymother fell down the (carpeted!) stairs—we hope only 2 or 3 of them—and brokeseveral bones in “non-displaced” ways. That, and the fact that both parentswere already fully vaccinated, was the lucky part! She is making a steady andremarkable recovery, with good days and bad days, and great home health care,plus lots of family and local support. Our fragility and resilience continue to amaze me. During this time, I participatedin an outdoor event on the steps of the history museum, a Remembrance of thoselost to Covid-19 in the past year. Candace Summers, Education Director at theMcLean County Museum of History, had arranged it, bringing speakers, a singer,young dancers, and me. “I’m no Amanda Gorman,” I had warned her, but I washonored to be asked. My inspiration came from our shared experiences over thelast year, plus words from the community, offered in the 12 Months in 6 Words project, and I used many of the shared words,ideas, feelings I found there, creating a poem of 6 stanzas of 6 lines each of6 words each. (The 666 association was, sadly, not lost on me.) My sister, whohad come from Nebraska to help, set it up on her laptop for my parents to watchas it streamed live, and the audience sat or stood in the blocked-off street atsafe social distances, bundled against the March chill. Candace had placed 175 smallwhite flags on the museum lawn, one for each of our community’s residents whodied; later, updated statistics raised that number to 200+. It was good to cometogether, safely, solemn and amazed. Zooms continued, Passovercame, Palm Sunday and Easter, I brought Jessy Randall to Poetry is NormalPresents via Zoom at the library, and I’m offering an annual poem-a-day forum inApril, as usual, in an online writing community I visit, but time feels evenweirder and more suspended than it already was during this pandemic year, ayear now stretching as if into forever, despite the increased availability oftesting, treatment, and vaccination. So many of us learned what we value, whatwe find important, necessary in our lives, and not so necessary. So many of ussuffered losses and changes. My thanks to all who are helping each otheradjust. My thanks to those helping my family in our time of need, and to thosehelping you and yours."},
{"title": "Meanwhile...", "date": "Thursday, February 18, 2021", "text": "While I was grousing, wrapping up in blankets, feeling cranky and fatigued from the cold and Zoom, Japan had an earthquake (a delayed aftershock), a train derailed downtown, there was a bad fire at a complex housing students (12 apartments destroyed, the residents displaced), local firefighters had to battle that fire and fires related to the derailment in sub-zero wind-chills, Texas had a snowstorm (!), Portland had an ice storm, and now it's snowed in Nashville. Meanwhile, though Covid-19 rates are down, people are still suffering and dying from it. My little problems feel small indeed. Still, I forgive myself and give myself the needed days of just reading and resting. It helps me be better, I hope, when I interact with people again. Sigh....One of the books I read on my couch was News of the World, by Paulette Jiles, a paperback I got from the ongoing library sale and which will go out in our Little Free Library once it's warm enough to go out there again. Tom Hanks is in the movie of this, and when I Googled it, it looked like I could see it on Netflix, but that was old news indeed. Or confusing news. Netflix streams it internationally but not here in the U.S., where it is again playing in some theatres, it appears. I will wait. But I am eager to see Helena Zengel, the young actor who plays the girl taken captive by the Kiowa, with whom she identifies, though her family of origin is German. I was drawn to her in the book.The sun is shining today! It's up to 22 degrees! I felt warmer at work by keeping my hat on, and now I'm warmer at home by keeping it on still! My chalkboard poems have been shivery and blurry but there all month so far, and it's a short month, so I'll probably make it--a poem a day."},
{"title": "Rough Week", "date": "Sunday, February 14, 2021", "text": "I had a rough week of not being able to do or say anything right 1) in Zoom meetings 2) in general. People sometimes disappear in Zoom if someone is screen sharing, and it's getting harder and harder for me to connect, engage in true communication, and feel like myself. Also, it's so very cold outside, and I'd rather sit on the couch reading books, wrapped up in a soft blue fleece blanket, than do anything else. Today I gave in to the couch, and that produced 4 poem drafts, a healing calm, and restored my sense of who I really am. Sigh... It helped this past week to call up some friends up spontaneously on the phone. Thank you, friends! It's been almost a year of isolation, and maybe I hadn't felt it as intensely till now. I know I've had it easier than many, as a shy person and an introvert and someone with a safe, masked, part-time job. Feeling for all the rest of you, you can be sure.This week I read things with blue dustjackets and/or circular patterns in them. One was a play--3 women trading conversations à la ronde. One was The Midnight Library, by Matt Haig, where one must choose among one's parallel lives in the multiverse. One was Faithful, by Alice Hoffman, in which a woman punishes herself, needing to heal and be forgiven. I was feeling like that. It helped to write some little poems, to send some poems out, to have a few taken.One was The Beginning of Spring, by Penelope Fitzgerald, a writer I like because of her writing and because she was a late bloomer, and a title I like, because of the hope in it. Sigh... The cover of the paperback, though, had snow. It takes place in Russia, like all the Russian stories in A Swim in a Pond in the Rain, by George Saunders, which I had just finished. The Beginning of Spring had a circular structure. I did indeed read all these books at exactly the right time. And now I am reading the Collected Stories of Shirley Hazzard, who calms with the clarity of her style, her subtle humor, her precise observations. Its dust-jacket of coral and gray calms me, as does her sense of nonlinear time: \"she couldn't be sure that she was not recollecting something in the future.\" This has happened to me."},

Along with reading.*I say “mostly” becauseevidently I am writing about it here in connection to crankiness, so itseffects may be lingering still. In the meantime, I was sohappy with myself for starting the year off right, and getting threesubmissions out in January, the last right on January 31. That submission wasrejected two days letter with a cheerful suggestion that I subscribe viadiscount. There was a brief moment then, too, of laugh-out-loud-crankiness-slash-recognition,as I said to myself, “Oh, yeah! That’s why I stopped submitting to thatjournal!” Auugghh. I actually write notes to myself in my non-Excelrecordkeeping system, “Do not submit here again” or “NEVER submit here again,”and, sadly, I don’t always heed my own advice, or I forget, after I have movedthose notes to the archived recordkeeping files.

The stories and his commentary makeme want to stop everything and write fiction again. (I did a little of that,longhand in a journal.) As it says in the poem above, I did feel nameless,gone, at one with the universe, at dusk, and I sense that at times in theRussians. My husband feels at-one-ment much of the time. In a comic version of allthis, I forgot who I was in an email, when someone referred to “Kathy,” and Ithought she meant me, but, to her, I am only “Kathleen.” We got it sorted out. It’s been very sunny herelately, but a deep, deep cold is coming soon. Thanks, Groundhog."},
{"title": "Reading-While-Walking", "date": "Sunday, January 24, 2021", "text": "I've been known to do that, read while walking, and knew I would love our new next-door neighbor back in Chicago, when I saw her reading-while-walking down the sidewalk on her way home one day! Our babies grew up side by side and played together in our back yards. Wonderful to encounter the practice again in the book Milkman, by Anna Burns, published in 2018, which I finally got around to reading, pretty much, as always, at exactly the right time! And how about that cover, that sunset, right? Looking up from one's reading, or one's life, to notice the actual colors of the actual sky is a crucial part of this book, in which what people say and do is completely constricted by their circumstances. This story is set in the \"troubles\" or \"sorrows\" of Northern Ireland, not ever named, like most of the characters. To stay alive during the political/religious conflicts raging all around, people have to contort themselves--their speech, their behavior, their emotions. Part of the \"right time\" to read this, for me, connects to the current constrictions of the pandemic, and part, the main part, is how it evokes the current political divide in the country I live in. We can't really talk to each other, kindly and well, because we're living in different realities. It's awkward, dangerous, and strange.The other book I read--quickly, sometimes skimming--at the \"right time\" was Together in a Sudden Strangeness: America's Poets Respond to the Pandemic, edited by Alice Quinn. This is a new book at the library, I was the first to check it out, and I didn't want to keep it too long, which is one reason for the skimming, another being self-protection. I didn't want to dwell too long in pandemic reflections, so if a poem was too long, too prosey-looking, or with too many virus-related words glaring up at me, or if it seemed too easy, bordering on the cliched or sentimental, I skipped it. Instead, I went for the shorter poems, with simple, direct language--\"simple\" being quite different from \"easy\" in my meaning here, with simple language so often the container for rich complexity.I want to share some favorite lines, images, facts, and, of course, random coincidii with you.I loved \"Facetime\" by George Bilgere, partly about the return of the animals to human-deserted places, and partly about phoning up the eels! I loved Sarah Paley's strong sonnet about a store cashier, \"At the Hardware Store on the Island (March 21, 2020),\" and noted the coincidence that Paley has a chapbook forthcoming from Eyewear Publishing called The Autobiography of an Eel. A coincidence of eels! Who gnu?In \"May Day,\" by Nicholas Christopher, I heard the woman crying out from a dark corner. I joined a man and his wife in delighting in watching a couple across the way who played cards every night in \"Cards,\" by John Freeman. It reminded me of my parents playing cards, and also playing characters playing cards in The Gin Game. I loved how the sequestration in \"As If,\" by Dana Levin, has shifted from \"natural sloth\" to \"domestic industry\" when suddenly two Labs, one black, one yellow, appear on Mount Atalaya in the past... Yes, anything can happen!I loved learning about \"arborial cemeteries\" in Gail Mazur's wonderful and funny \"Matzoh.\" I was sad to learn this personal history detail from \"Under Juncos, the Baby Stones,\" by Tess Taylor, which begins:     Grandmother, born 1918,     half-orphaned, mother dead of the flu,     your father, widowed, alone,     taped your mouth shut     to keep you from crying.There is the connection of our pandemic to the 1918 pandemic, and also to whatever contortions of grief and circumstances might be happening now. My heart broke to read the phenomenal \"An American Nurse Foresees Her Death,\" by Amit Majmudar, where, sadly, the title tells the story. With \"Leaving Evanston,\" by Deborah Garrison, I sympathized with the theatre students having to leave school before their spring showcase production, before their Commencement, and thus also with all the students whose lives and expectations were disrupted this past spring...and likely will be in the spring to come. \"How I wish feeling terrible felt useful, as it did when I was a teenager,\" says Nicole Cooley in the poem \"At CVS Wearing a Mask I Buy Plastic Eggs for My Daughter.\" That resonated, and also reminded me of the narrator of Milkman, who is seventeen and eighteen when the main events happen; it's hard to come of age when the adults don't know how to show you, teach you, bring you along. And in \"Poem for My Students,\" by Sharon Olds, I encountered \"chain-reading\" (like chain smoking), something I do, reading one book right after another.Despite my skimming and skipping, I found much to marvel at in ...a Sudden Strangeness, including this deftness with line and stanza break in the beautiful and simple \"Quarantine\" by Dave Lucas, that begins:     You could not come to me                    so instead I set out for you                    these lines.And I identify with this impulse in \"A Private Life,\" by Mark Wunderlich, which I may, though lacking in chickens, follow:     I think when this is done, I'll stay     shut in, tending my hens, mending     the threadbare life nobody will see."},
{"title": "Still the Right Book at the Right Time", "date": "Sunday, January 17, 2021", "text": "The judge in the Calyx prose-writing contest, where I was a runner-up, compared me to Sigrid Nunez. I kept coming across her name in other reading, and figured it was the right time to seek her out. I read For Rouenna, about a Vietnam War nurse, and Sempre Susan, her memoir of Susan Sontag. And, while I really enjoyed her discursive style, sometimes fragmentary and vignette-like, which reminded me of Jenny Offill, I didn't understand the comparison to me. Then I read The Friend--about a dog! And grief. Yes, and also about writing and writers in academia, and I finally saw the connection, as that's also the subject matter of my story \"A Retiring Woman.\" At any rate, a fine compliment!I didn't have any \"anxiety of influence,\" as I was just reading the book now, and I wrote the story years ago and kept submitting it and revising it over the years until it found its proper home, which I had always thought was Calyx, having sent them an earlier draft before entering the prize competition! Ah, persistence. Ah, coincidence. The coincidences abound. For one, Nunez writes, \"My own first writing teacher used to tell her students that if there was anything else they could do with their lives instead of becoming writers, any other profession, they should do it.\" That's exactly what my dad told me, only about acting! Ironically, he was encouraging me to pursue writing instead.Another coincidence is that the novel I read right before this one, Anxious People, by Fredrik Backman, also has suicide as a central subject. In Backman's book, a bridge is the site of a suicide and an attempted suicide that persist in the memories of characters brought together in an \"anxious\" situation. In The Friend, the narrator is recalling some suicide facts reported by a coroner about people who jumped into the Seine: \"Those whose reason for wanting to die was love had tried to scramble back out of the water. Those whose reason was financial ruin had sunk like stones.\" Both reasons occur in the Backman book. And there's an important bridge in The Friend that the narrator has in view when she visits the site of a famous double suicide, also the grave site, on \"a shady green slope\" down to a lake in Germany. And as I read about the swans in Germany in The Friend, I recalled the swans in and around Berlin in the poems of Maria Garcia Teutsch, which I had published in Escape Into Life, with images of love, snow, water, bridge...death.And then I encountered Rilke, also quoted by Patricia Hampl in The Art of the Wasted Day and in one of my blog entries about that. Nunez's narrator, quoting Rilke in italics, commenting on her own reading (the way I comment upon mine in my blog...) says, \"Once again I come upon his famous definition of love: two solitudes that protect and border and greet each other.\" In the Hampl book, the translation chooses \"touch\" instead of \"border.\" I had just just quoted that book/translation here, noting the similarity to my own marriage, in the context of being lucky to be married to another artist. Layer upon layer of reading the right book at the right time, making almost every day a Random Coinciday.Finally, I identified with the problems of writing itself: \"You write a thing down because you're hoping to get a hold on it. You write about experiences partly to understand what they mean.... But there's always the danger of the opposite happening. Losing the memory of the experience to the memory of writing about it.\" Nunez makes that connection to people who realize some of their memories arise not so much from events themselves but from photographs of these events. I know I sometimes lose track of what really happened if I make a poem of my own experience, or base a story on observed life and behaviors. I often write to better understand something or someone, to expand my compassion for someone who hurt me or behaved badly or inexplicably. What would make someone do that? I ask, and then try to answer that question in a story that loves the character who did it, in part by exploring the character's motivation, as I would as an actor...  By the time the story is finished, my compassion is expanded, yes, but my imagination has already taken over, and my fiction-writing self has mixed and matched details as needed, and who knows what the \"facts\" were on the way to the new truth? That's why it's fiction. Hmm, is this another \"wasted day\"?"},
{"title": "Chess Story", "date": "Tuesday, January 5, 2021", "text": "A couple days ago I mentioned I was reading Chess Story, by Stefan Zweig; it's a short one, and I've finished it. I was sort of thrilled to recognize chess facts and names from my earlier reading and viewing of The Queen's Gambit, and noticed how a character in Chess Story can and must visualize the board the way Beth Harmon does, although without the help of green tranquilizers.What I didn't expect was the strange pertinence of this novella to now, even though I have noticed weird coincidences in my \"Covid reading\" before. A character in Chess Story is held as a prisoner to get information out of him, and the form of psychological torture is \"the most exquisite isolation imaginable.\" Yes, it's a form of solitary confinement but in a hotel. \"They did nothing--other than subjecting us to complete nothingness. For, as is well known, nothing on earth puts more pressure on the human mind than nothing. Locking each of us into a total vacuum, a room hermetically sealed off from the outside world....\" Well, you get the idea. I know people are truly suffering in their loneliness and isolation right now.The prisoner suffers, and a doctor later gives him some relief, saying \"Perfectly understandable when you get down to it,\" speaking of the forced isolation. \"Since March 13, isn't it?\" March 13 was when my own isolation began, a stay-at-home order beginning a work-from-home period until June 1. And I know that Friday the 13th was the end, and beginning, of something similar for a lot of us here in the USA. Imagine my shock at seeing that particular date in a book from 1941 that I was reading in 2021.My recent reading has also delighted me with word meanings. I was reminded in Chess Story that a dilletante, that dabbler so often despised for surface involvement, is simply someone who delights in, say, the arts, as an amateur is someone who does something for the love of it. Zweig speaks of \"a true dilettante in the best sense of the word, one who plays for the pure delight--that is, the diletto--of playing.\" I also looked up \"antimacassar\" (I think in The Queen's Gambit?), a word I always get from context, and delighted in the discovery that this upholstery protector = anti + Macassar, a brand of hair oil. Perfect!"},
{"title": "The Queen's Gambit", "date": "Sunday, January 3, 2021", "text": "We watched and enjoyed The Queen's Gambit, a limited series on Netflix, and when I saw it was based on a book, I knew I'd have to read it. What a delight! The Queen's Gambit, by Walter Tevis, is as sharp and stylish, and relentless in pursuit of the game, as the series. And both have the perfect ending! In the novel, privy to the inner life of the main character, I had an even better sense of the fear, anger, and vulnerability of the orphaned girl who becomes a great chess player. The Queen's Gambit was the last book I read in 2020, finished on New Year's Eve, for a total of 162 books in 2020.By chance, I was seeking out--and found, through interlibrary loan--The Post Office Girl, by Stefan Zweig, which I read next, another great story with a young woman as the central character, a vulnerable person tossed by circumstances who develops an anger about her life that helps her rise above despair. Maybe. Also by chance, I found Chess Story,* also by Zweig, also translated by Joel Rotenberg, which I am reading now. *Sometimes translated as The Royal Game.And completely by chance, I found myself resting my chin on my hands, and my elbows on the windowsill, just like Anya Taylor-Joy in her thinking pose, regarding the chessboard or her opponent, while looking out the window at great fallen chunks of ice, all looking like the white pieces in chess. This was during the first power outage, followed, alas, by the second power outage, an interesting but chilly way to start the year 2021! I am grateful to have the heat back on, the tree lights back on, and not to be cooking by candlelight...although it was romantic and sort of fun.So it was two days of reading by milky (foggy, overcast) sunlight, wrapped in the silky blue blankie, layered in jammies, sweater, soft blue robe, wearing scarves around my neck and fingerless gloves. Talk about the \"wasted day\"! And now I am catching up, with email, blog, various bits of online business, and warmth, in general. We rang in the new year literally with a glass bell in our back yard, at midnight, with friends who came bundled and masked, standing around a wood fire laid in a barbecue grill, with champagne, while other backyard neighbors 1) also rang a bell 2) set off fireworks. The ice storm came the next day, with many branches down, followed by inches of snow. Followed by tree-cutters and power company guys. We finally realized, when four trucks pulled up in front of our house, and workers in bright vests carried a ladder into our back yard, that a subcontractor was perhaps carrying out a six-year-old work order, dating from a past ice storm with a four-day power outage at Christmastime, back when we could gather with family, when the workers climbed up, rigged a pulley to the electric lines that come from the pole to the house, and fixed slack lines into taut lines. Shortly thereafter, we had power! Power! Which might comfort Stefan Zweig's and Walter Tevis's characters!! And that makes it a Random Coinciday in the blog!"},
{"title": "Wasted Day, Part 2", "date": "Wednesday, December 30, 2020", "text": "I've already taken The Art of the Wasted Day, by Patricia Hampl, back to the library, shortly after it renewed itself for me, so to speak. I remember getting a wee bit bogged down in the middle--somehow fitting, given my preoccupation with possible laziness, and more my fault than Hampl's, I'm sure--but then personal details about Michel de Montaigne (all the deaths he'd experienced, and how his retreat into essays was to contemplate death) and her marriage brought me back, as did a second pot of coffee...\"The job of being human is not figuring things out, but getting lost in thought,\" says Hampl, contemplating all the contemplative writers, thinkers, and born daydreamers. On Augustine's Confessions, Book 10, a meditation on Genesis, she writes, \"Reading, therefore, is concentrated life, not a pastiche of life or an alternative to life. The soul, pondering, is experience.\" Yes! That is indeed what it feels like when I read.Randomly, I used my diary to record some of my thoughts on her book. In my reading journal, I recorded some of her reflections on her marriage, noting its similarity to my own. In The Art of the Wasted Day, the \"you\" she addresses is her husband. \"In a moment of great tenderness I once confessed...that I loved living with you. It's like being alone, I said happily. You cocked your beautiful head and said mildly, I gather that's a compliment?\" That reminded me of our side-by-side lives in a long marriage, a double solitude for which I am grateful but that has sometimes left me sad. It is, though, the perfect marriage for two artists. Hampl also quotes Rilke in Letters to a Young Poet, saying, \"Rilke describes the ideal relationship as a love that consists in this, that two solitudes protect and touch and greet each other.\"All through the book, Hampl is aware that the contemplative life, the life with enough leisure to daydream, is a privileged life. She's aware of Rilke's desertion of his own wife as he spent his solitude in the homes of the wealthy. But back to her own marriage, and its similarity to mine! \"After a whirlwind courtship of eight years, you liked to say, we got married.\" I say \"courtship,\" too! And we \"courted\" for eight years before we married, as well! And that makes it a Random Coinciday!"},
{"title": "Right Book at the Right Time", "date": "Saturday, December 26, 2020", "text": "I love it when I read the right book at the right time...and when it automatically renews itself at the library for me! Right now that book is The Art of the Wasted Day, by Patricia Hampl. I'm reading it as I waste this particular day, the day after Christmas, which feels meandering and slow compared to yesterday (cooking the dinner) and the days before (preparations, small as they were, for this year's holiday). It's the right time in the sense of following upon my Laziness vs. Diligence blog entry, comforting me by affirming me in my \"laziness\" that is not quite that, and in my slatternly ways on a Slattern Day in the blog. In her Prelude (brief introduction), Hampl is speaking of Michel de  Montaigne, creator/practitioner of the personal essay, whose father engaged a lute player to follow him around the house as a child, encouraging his son's imagination, daydreaming, indolence. \"There was fugitive genius in this indolence,\" says Hampl, ultimately praising Montaigne as \"the first modern daydreamer.\"\"He divined early the value of being sluggish, lax, drowsy...\" I needn't worry about my own bouts of sluggishness! As an aware, daydreaming child, sitting under a beechnut tree, Hampl, too, committed early to \"the life of the mind,\" her italics. Revising my own previous worries, as someone who, like Hampl, later in life, makes relentless to-do lists, I can concur in regard to late-stage laid-backness: \"This isn't sloth, it isn't laziness. It isn't even exhaustion. It is a late-arriving awareness of consciousness existing for its own purpose, rippling with contentment and curiosity. One's own idiosyncrasy reveals itself as a pleasure, without other value--but golden, amusing, integrity hard-won and now at its leisure. Hand on heart, this life of the mind, lolling--tending to life's real business.\" I'm comforted, too, by Montaigne's own thoughts on essayistic writing, liberally quoted by Hampl: \"If it doesn't go along gaily and freely, it goes nowhere worth going.\" This is how I feel about my ephemeral blog writing--it goes along gaily and freely, usually composed on the spot, though sometimes I take notes--say, in my reading journal, if I want to quote something (as I have done here), and both Hampl and Montaigne are/were note takers! The spontaneity of blog writing is good because (Montaigne again) \"the anxiety to do well, and the tension of straining too intently on one's work, put the soul on the rack, break it, and make it impotent.\" So far, my soul is not on the rack, it is not broken! Oddly, Montaigne doesn't look all that gay and free in his frilly ruff!"},
{"title": "Laziness vs. Diligence", "date": "Sunday, December 20, 2020", "text": "WhenI get cold or melancholy, a kind of laziness overtakes me. At bedtime, I don’twant to take off the layers of t-shirts under my clothes to put on my jammies.(Fortunately, I am good at taking off a bra under my clothes and out through asleeve like Jennifer Beals in Flashdance.)On sad days now, when I look at the Christmas tree and know my kids aren’tcoming home, I don’t want to get up from the couch, where I am bundled in asoft, blue blankie, reading a book, even though I know I should get up and moveevery hour—to keep warm, to keep the body moving, not sitting, because it’swiser, healthier, not as sad.Andthen I do it, because I am in thehabits of diligence. I hear the washing machine stop, so I go put the clothesin the dryer and start a new load. I hear the mail carrier come, so I get themail, then put on a coat, and re-deliver a mis-delivered piece of mail to myneighbor next door. I diligently write down who sent a Christmas card, andwhen, on my little list, and commit to writing a card back, if I haven’t sentone already, during this especially good year to maintain connection withpeople…. Iwondered if the more precise word was lassitude,but I don’t think so. Lassitude is aweariness, a lack of energy, and so is lethargy.Laziness is a disinclination to work.At these sad, cold, lazy moments, I am disinclined to get up and do thenecessary bit of work, but, once I do get up, I have the necessary energy. I doa lot of small, steady tasks, all the time. I have patience and perseverance. Ikeep to-do lists. Yes,my laziness is temporary, cold-induced, connected to melancholy. I’m aware ofthis…and of the way sadness can clutch at me sometimes. I can feel the pulldown. I have various ways of saying no to the pull, even as the tears fill myeyes and start their spill, even if it’s just getting up from the book I’drather read than do anything else, to do anything else. Andthen, back to the book. And on to the next book. So far this year—and there aretwo weeks to go—I’ve read 155 books. These include plays, poetry books,chapbooks, and graphic novels, as well as novels, memoirs, books of essays,books of short stories. My coffee table is stacked with books ready for a secondlockdown, books not yet begun, finished books not yet shelved elsewhere, booksin progress with bookmarks sticking out, library books that will automaticallyrenew. Clearly, these books, these stacks, represent my combined laziness vs.diligence, conflict resolved. And a Slattern Day in the blog."},
{"title": "Christmas Movies 3", "date": "Saturday, December 12, 2020", "text": "Well, 1) I did watch The Shop Around the Corner, and it was charming. The scene in You've Got Mail where Tom Hanks has his friend (Dave Chapelle) look in a coffeeshop window to check out the blind date waiting there (Meg Ryan) is just like the one in The Shop Around the Corner, down to the dialogue, but with Jimmy Stewart, Felix Bressart, and Margaret Sullavan. 2) We saw two more not-really-a-Christmas-movie Christmas movies in the tradition of Die Hard: Peppermint and Olympus Has Fallen. I love 13 Going on 30 and Juno so was happy to watch Jennifer Garner be strong and vengeful in a Charles Bronson kind of way; yes, it was sort of a Christmasy Death Wish. Sigh... I also watched Miracle on 34th Street and its remake, and I'm sure I'll get around to It's a Wonderful Life. Because it is a wonderful life. On Thursday it was sunny and 60 degrees, and I took an extra walk on the trail, after walking to work and back. I ran into Santa!! At first I didn't recognize him, because he was wearing sunglasses and he wasn't wearing his Santa suit. But he will be! I saw him back in May or June in his Santa suit, waving at cars on Vernon Avenue, and he plans to do that again next week, bringing lots of joy. He's sorry he can't have kids on his lap at Santa Station, as in past years, but this will be good, too.That same day I walked the outdoor labyrinth and ran into a live concert, sort of. In the bandshell, a group of guys with guitars and one harmonica were sitting in a socially-distanced circle, playing music. Lovely! I was a bit worried for them, as there was some singing, and their circle faced in, but I am hoping they are OK because they were outdoors. I was at a distance on a bench, with my eye also on an adorable toddler Husky out walking his man.And today I did some holiday baking: chocolate oat bars. This is something I baked for my husband 39 years ago--what?!--dating during our first holiday time together. Now it's almost our 31st anniversary, so they're here to go with the champagne, which is already purchased (on \"datenight,\" our weekly early-morning grocery shopping trip) to remind us to celebrate. **runs off to put champagne in fridge** So it's a Fat Tuesday (on a Saturday) in the blog, thanks to the chocolate chips melted with sweetened condensed milk and buttery cookie base. Good thing the oatmeal makes it healthy! And also a Slattern Day, because my work is done! Ta-ta and toodleoo!Update: Speaking of Die Hard, you might prefer the lesbian Die Hard mentioned here."},
{"title": "The Day Got Away", "date": "Sunday, December 6, 2020", "text": "Yesterday I had plans, a to-do list, et cetera. Nope. And also, yes. I did change the sheets. I did get 75 letters to my precinct printed out, stamped, signed, and addressed! It was a letter thanking my precinct neighbors for voting, reminding them that we have an election April 6, 2021, wishing them Happy Holidays, and reporting that we were the best precinct!--with 87.26% voter turnout! Wow, right?! I had planned to send the letter in time to say Happy Thanksgiving, but the individual precinct results weren't posted yet, so I waited. I had planned to walk into town in the sunshine yesterday to mail these letters at the post office, but the day got away from me, and dark was falling as I signed the last of the letters in red and green, drawing holly exclamation points. Before that, I had planned to meet a friend for a hike in the woods. But first I had to check my email... Yesterday's email contained a poem acceptance. So first I attended to the contractual details there. Then I updated all the files (physical and digital) related to that, because, these days, if I don't do it in the moment I might not do it. The poem was part of a 4-poem submission, and I wondered where the other 3 might go next. Again, I have to do this in the moment, or the moment gets away. For example, I had been thinking of a particular place to send these poems if they came back, but that deadline had just passed 6 days before. I looked at another journal I've wanted to send to--and, yay, they look at only 3 poems at a time. Perfect! But was it perfect? Was this the right place to send these 3 poems? Now I'm following two roads that are diverging in the woods I was supposed to be hiking--one road has poems I might send, and the other has places I might send them to. While I'm on the one road, I keep going down little unfamiliar side paths that turn out to be poems I wrote in April, or, when did I write that? Finally, I give up and fold the sheets fresh and warm from the dryer.A few years ago, I joined other poets in trying to get 100 rejections a year, because to get that many rejections you have to do a lot of submissions. Then we'd report on our stats. Now it feels like I can barely count, that I don't remember how I tallied things. Yes, I sent out 20 submissions in 2020. That's all! I got 13 rejections, 6 acceptances, 1 pending response. Carrying over from 2019, my work appeared in 9 publications--a total of 16 poems, newly published or reprints. The more recently accepted work is forthcoming in 2021. I can do the figuring, but I can't quite see how it all adds up. Or, in an existential way, why I'm doing it, or, since I do keep doing it, and thus it must be valuable or important to me, why I'm sometimes forgetting the actual poems. Yes, I'll get back to them, see what they were about, revise them or leave them alone, but it's odd to feel so disconnected from a previous practice, one that I do in the privacy of my home, anyway, that doesn't depend on the previous human connections. The disconnect has entered my brain. Now, perhaps, the same thing is happening again, the day getting away as I write this blog entry, as I tally my statistics for the year, as I look back at things I forgot I did, poems I forgot I wrote. 2020 has crammed my brain full of worry and details and strange little poems...and to-do lists of things that do and don't get done.And yet, I am glad of the voting stats, the super local turnout. I am glad that my tiny chalkboard poems reached the hearts and minds of those who saw them. I was connected that way, during the disconnect. Someday I may look back on 2020 with the cliched hindsight...and understand things I'm not understanding now. Sigh... I already wear tri-focals."},

I was inspired by all their new and unusual ways of being/staying creative and the small daily ways we can be creative and keep our spirits up. And I was touched again by how many people enjoyed and responded to my tiny chalkboard poems. I did this in July and September, too, and I was moved and delighted then by the outpouring of love and appreciation. People are sad when I say goodbye.My last few poems in November became people's favorites, as if I was finally warming up just before I had to stop. That's how it goes sometimes! But I knew I needed a rest and a shift in December, and to move the chalkboard down to the basement again. I yearned for a Christmas tree, and that might mean a furniture rearrangement. Yes, indeed. Where the chalkboard once stood, in front of the poetry bookcases in my home office, I have put a nice rocking chair for reading, moved from the living room to make room for the tree. Decorating the house and the tree has been one of those small, daily ways of being/staying creative!Lots of people liked my tiny poem about singing to my kids:Grown ChildrenI sang to them,their whole small lives,and sometimes nowthey burst into my wildhilarious songs! November 25, 2020And lots identified with the blues in this one:BluesSad in a cozylittle way, wrapped in a blueblanket, reading a bluebook of short stories. November 27, 2020A co-worker painted watercolors in response to two of my poems--one about wind, one about the wind blowing a \"sideways mum\" into my yard--and someday maybe we can hang her paintings and my poems along with other staff art in the little art gallery in our public library!

They are Christmas movies, but, specifically, they start with unlikely work parties on Christmas Eve!! But what I want to tell you about today is how I got to delight myself by announcing loudly in my head, \"It's a Thanksgiving movie!\" while re-watching You've Got Mail as a likely Christmas movie!! Tom Hanks sticks his head through a turkey photo op cut-out! There is more than one turkey image in this film, and more than one holiday, and it goes through seasons, ending with love in the spring, but, yes, Christmas is crucial in determining whether the bookshop will survive.You've Got Mail is based on The Shop Around the Corner (which is based on a Hungarian play), and that resolves on Christmas Eve. We have that one at the library, so it's likely to be up next in my Christmas-movie queue! I remember a sadness at the heart of it, a human complexity sometimes missing in popular contemporary holiday movies, but maybe I'm just becoming a curmudgeon. Other surprises from You've Got Mail: character names Kathleen and Christina (my sister and me!)! Kathleen owns the bookshop, and Christina works there. Christina is played by Heather Burns, also in one of my other go-to feel-good, funny movies, Miss Congeniality. Kathleen mentions Rudy Giuliani! She confesses during a break-up scene that she forgot to vote in the mayoral election. His opponent was Ruth Messinger, so she maybe forgot to vote for Ruth.Yesterday and the day before I took long walks in the Thanksgiving weekend sunshine, mailing a first batch of Christmas cards at the Uptown post office, avoiding the shopping strip (though I do love our local shops), restocked the Little Free Library with children's Christmas books for Iris Harley, and hung a strip of tiny white lights on the patio door to dangle free and loop around the houseplants. I yearn for a tree. We'll see. I have lost track of the day of the week, but since I did all my housework yesterday, I'll call it a Slattern Day in the blog."},
{"title": "Christmas Movies", "date": "Friday, November 27, 2020", "text": "What do Love, Actually and Die Hard have in common? Well, 1) Alan Rickman as the bad guy 2) airport scenes 3) specifically, a girl running to a guy in an airport and jumping on him, wrapping her legs around his waist, and 4) they are Christmas movies. I have begun the annual watching of the Christmas movies with these two, plus The Santa Clause and White Christmas. (I may have started this in the spring or summer, but I have started it over now in the usual seasonal fashion.)Not everybody loves Love, Actually, but I do. The lush interludes of music, during which someone does or doesn't get the guy/gal, always grab my heart. Emma Thompson listening to Joni Mitchell, through tears, as Anton Chekhov would say. Certain things always make me laugh, cry, or cringe, and I enjoy the pop songs. But this year, the airport scenes were excruciating. They had all their original power as scenes of love and joy, as people greet each other, but I saw them side by side with news photos of people in airports for Thanksgiving travel, and I ached with worry and dismay.Because I tend to watch these movies late at night, to fall asleep, I fall asleep. Then I pick up where I left off to see the rest, so I watch them gradually over mostly consecutive nights. This morning, though, I wanted to finish White Christmas with breakfast (yogurt, granola), and tears sprang to my eyes when the old General sees his old soldiers. I'm a silly old fool for love.I am glad to say these movies have managed to cheer me up, as did a long walk in the afternoon sunshine. I have much to be grateful for, and I am indeed thankful. And I wish you all a Happy Thanksgiving weekend, good vaccine news, and merrier times to come."},

Sigh... But, back to the joy part, I had no trouble picking out 5 bags of what I wanted, including mint, almond, plain milk chocolate, and peppermint bark bells. Instead of eating breakfast, I was placing the dishes around the house. Somehow, this helps.Mid-morning at work, I saw the email showing a picture of (individually-wrapped) goodies and little Starbuck's iced coffee bottles! So I had some! Then home to a Honeycrisp apple, and the Governor, live, telling us we are back in Tier 3, to please stay home, starting Friday, to keep us all alive. I am glad that my little chalkboard poems are \"soft joys\" for those who see them here, or on Facebook or Instagram. I'm grateful they are hitting the spot.Likewise, I was delighted with the response to my story, \"A Retiring Woman,\" and grateful to Calyx for publishing it online. My daughter and her boyfriend were gripped by it, and she quoted a passage on integrity of voice. My son said he laughed out loud! Yay! It's a long story, and so many people read it and responded. I am wowed. Those are big things in my life, but the little, goofy things help, too. One day, I found myself gardening in pearls. Ah, it was Election Day, a lovely warm day, and I was wearing (fake) pearls to honor RBG, and there was yard work to be done. Another day, I was dusting in earrings, post Zoom, which is the only time I put on drop earrings. It felt good to dust, and to re-stack my stacks of books awaiting the second lockdown, as I sometimes think of it, but nobody likes the word \"lockdown,\" and the Governor is just announcing a return to Tier 3, for all of Illinois, to help avoid a firmer stay-at-home order.

Today, to avoid starting one of these things, I put up my sweet turquoise-colored wooden Christmas tree decorations atop the piano to make myself happy. Superstitiously, I also put off posting a poem on my chalkboard by writing a mock-superstitious mock-haiku. No joke, though, I really didn't want to jinx anything by posting the real poem I'd been working on...and I have learned to listen to my gut.What things make me nervous?

So, mixed fear and annoyance about lack of response. Sometimes it's dread of certain people who find fault with anything I do. I know this is probably from their own fears and insecurities, but it still gets to me, hurts my feelings.

So far, though, 1) the weather has been gorgeous and warm, and I could have left it outside, and 2) a lot of my poems are about patience and waiting! Turns out, I'm writing longer poems in my head as I walk back and forth to work, but those disappear into the bramble of my brain. I remember salient images from them, and their walking rhythms, but they are mostly gone. That's probably fine. I recall, and often use, a composing/revising technique I learned years ago of writing a draft of a poem and then not looking at it and writing it out again. Only what is important comes back!Yesterday, freight trains came through town on both my walks. On the way into town, I saw the marvelous graffiti that gave me this small poem that started as a haiku, expanded into a double haiku (not really a thing), was briefly a reverse haibun (also not a thing) in the bramble, and eventually became two stanzas that fit on a chalkboard.Freight TrainGraffiti on its box carsgives me the fingerover and over.I smile in the sun,admiring the patient artof angry artists.On my walk back home, I was joined at the corner by a friend on his way back to our neighborhood. We chatted, masked, for a long time, as all lights were red, waiting for the long freight train to go by. He'd been an election judge at our polling place and gave me a few more details of his day. We waited long enough to see the bad behavior of impatient drivers--turning right or left from the wrong lane, U-turn on a one-way street, driving too fast for the delayed traffic--and eventually witnessed an accident. A young woman took the right turn too fast and smashed the corner of her car into the corner of a building. She began to scream, continued screaming as she got safely out of her car, and as masked people came to help. I was calling 911, and so were several others, evidently, as by the time I got through, the police knew about it.The train was stopped now, all crossing bars down. I could see that no emergency vehicles would be able to get through until the bars went up. The police station, blocks away, is on the other side of the tracks. Et cetera. Drivers continued to make bad choices, especially when the crossing bars went up, and they surged and turned into the path of police cars to get where they wanted to go, but finally help reached the woman, and she walked into the ambulance with two fellows helping. My friend gave a witness statement, and I chatted with a young man with a bike, who had come to work in the building she'd just hit. He had a bandage on his head from an accident that morning--bike, car--and seemed a bit befuddled, repeating his story with exact words to everyone who came near.Walking away, I could see how easily we could have been in the driver's path. There were two white turn arrows painted on the street. One pointed to the sidewalk a few feet from where we stood, and one pointed to the building where she had crashed. These are advance warning arrows, but it was as if she had followed the second one exactly. Her car took the arrow's path, not the street. How is she doing now, that young woman? What a horrible day for her, on what a beautiful day.I went home and collected yard signs for candidates (to return or recycle) and raked the side yard of tulip poplar leaves and sat in the back yard with the squirrels and read a book and drafted more poems and said hello to a tiny dog that had been running around the neighborhood and eventually into my back yard (where the gate is stuck open), explaining some past incidences of poop. And now I know the identity of the dog's people...the back yard neighbors down the way who curse a lot. Maybe they'll turn up in a poem someday."},

Phone at hand, I called 911 to report this. The officer was calm, like me, and said they'd drive through the complex to check it out. No news of tragedy later that day, no sound of sirens as I continued through the beauty of the afternoon. Somehow, this is my/our life right now, yes? Possible, potential, even probable disaster near at hand, but uncertain, and maybe not. Maybe we'll be OK.Maybe it was a Halloween prank. We did not turn on our porch light for trick-or-treaters this year. Instead, I put book hedgehogs and candy in the Little Free Library in case anybody came by. Somebody did come by, leaving two bags of peanut M&Ms, my favorite! But I haven't checked yet today to see if some books went home with kids or grownups, and whether I'll need to bring candy back inside. I had put some solar lights in the ground that day, and they worked: they lit up fine at night.There was a Trump rally in our town on October 22. I found out about it after the fact--900 people at the local baseball stadium. Pictures showed the masked and unmasked, and people sort of spread out in the bleachers. It was a watch party for the debate, with the debate on the big electronic screen out there. Yes, Covid cases have been on the uptick since, but that's happening everywhere. The direct result of the rally that I saw locally was the appearance of yard signs. A news photo from the rally showed all the Republican signs stacked up for people to take, and, sure enough, they started popping up over the next few days in my precinct, which had mostly Democrat yard signs before, plus some perennial Republican incumbent signs.Of the above, the labyrinth, the fall beauty, and the Little Free Library give me joy and peace. Hang in there, everybody. We really are all in this together. I hope we make it through with as much love and kindness as we can muster, \"muster\" being a battle term, alas, or a group of peacocks."},

But in the moment, I am just happy for small joys, like finding the book Lambslide, by Ann Patchett, illustrated by Robin Preiss Glasser, as part of my work today! As things change and adjust during these Covid times, I will now sometimes process children's books, as well as grown-up books, plus movies and music, at the library. So Lambslide came my way, and I hope that Escape Goat, their newest collaboration, will, too! As you can see, Lambslide is about some sliding lambs, as well as how to work together to help create what you want in the world.

{"title": "Broadcast Hysteria", "date": "Sunday, October 25, 2020", "text": "I had not intended to impose a quarantine on my blog, but many, many days have gone by since I have written here. I've been reading and writing and getting out the vote in my precinct, working, gardening, and doing a little outdoor visiting, safely, while I can. The weather has changed several times--rain, chill, return to summer--so I've done some of my reading outdoors, and I've transplanted five bright yellow mums into the ground, hoping they return, as, for me, yellow is the color of joy.I feel suspended, at loose ends, busy, scattered. I know it is election anxiety on top of Covid uncertainty, flux, change, stasis...  I've written some small monster poems, a couple inspired by the book I am now reading: Broadcast Hysteria: Orson Welles's War of the Worlds and the Art of Fake News, by A. Brad Schwartz. I'm reading it to get ready for a broadcast of Howard Koch's radio adaptation of War of the Worlds, the science fiction novel by H.G. Wells*, coming up October 30, at 8:00 p.m. on WGLT, our local NPR affiliate station, and produced by Heartland Theatre Company. This is the famous radio play broadcast on October 30, 1938 as part of Orson Welles's Mercury Theatre of the Air,** and some people who tuned in late, after the announcement that clarified it was fiction, an entertainment, did get scared and confused, thinking the \"fake news\" aspect of its presentation was real news, about a possible meteor landing, poisonous gas attacks, or Martians taking over the earth. Apparently, most who heard the Martians part realized it was science fiction...but some ran out of their houses to escape, just not as many, as this book makes clear, as newspaper reports the next day seemed to suggest. This Schwartz book is from 2015 and is firmly aware of the contemporary \"fake news\" problem, also situating \"fake news\" in history as an ongoing sensationalism-to-sell-papers thing and a more complicated and subtle freedom of the press vs regulation thing. Interesting! And fun to read about Orson Welles and his theatre, radio, film projects in this context, too.Mostly, I am avoiding any personal broadcast hysteria by regulating what I read or watch or listen to in terms of news. Sigh... And cleaning out the basement.*I remember first hearing about this as a kid, from my dad, and getting the two \"wells\" people mixed up in my mind, which has lasted into adulthood even though I know the difference between them. Memory and the mind work in weird ways.**I meant to say \"Mercury Theatre on the Air\" (not \"of\") but I'm correcting my typo down here (instead of up there) because I like the ethereal feel of a theatre of the air!"},
{"title": "40 Days, 40 Writes", "date": "Sunday, September 6, 2020", "text": "Before I resumed the chalkboard poems in September, I was engaged in two other projects--one was reading: the Sealey Challenge to read poetry books in August, and one was writing: 40 Days, 40 Writes, designed to immerse you in daily writing practice. These projects overlapped and kept me very busy! And I recommend both!Writing for 40 days again reminded me that the word \"quarantine\" refers to a 40-day period, a definition I encountered in various places as we all socially isolated starting in March. Ships had to stay docked for 40 days before passengers and crew could disembark during the Black Plague, though isolation periods for contagion existed long before that particular word came into use. One of the upcoming sessions at 40 Days, 40 Writes will use prompts created by writers during an earlier coronavirus quarantine session.The new sessions start September 7, Labor Day--the basic session; September 14--a memoir session, and September 21--an alumni session for those who have done an earlier session. Programs are free, but you can donate. I recommend this for those who want to develop a daily writing practice as regular as a daily yoga practice or meditation practice, something you look forward to that also challenges you and helps you create your own rituals and/or insures you make time and space to write. Leader Robin sends little encouraging tips and reminders as you go, answers questions, and solves problems!Since I have various forms of daily writing practice, I tended to use this as a freewriting opportunity, using the prompt and the suggested amount of time (in minutes that gradually increase) to explore what was on my mind and in my subconscious at the time of writing. This alternated with times I read the prompt early and then mused on it during my walk to work and back, so the writing might be more rooted and planned by the time I physically wrote it down observing the time period.Some of my writing came out in poem drafts, and I did notice a gradual readiness for new poems by the end of the 40 days, which may have been reinforced by all the reading during the Sealey Challenge! Of course, now I am writing poems about cryptids for a call for submissions from Jessy Randall, guest editing at Snakeskin! This one is the Kraken, aka Colossal Octopus by Pierre Denys de Montfort.And now it is raining, though probably not for 40 days and 40 nights..."},
{"title": "Chalkboard Poems", "date": "Saturday, September 5, 2020", "text": "On September 1, I resumed my little chalkboard poem project, a poem a day on an easel-style green chalkboard (stained from paint and pastel crayons) standing beside my front stoop. I did this in June, to bring a little cheer via Facebook and Instagram, and it did! But I knew I needed a rest and other projects to feel freshly inspired, so I did a lot of reading and other kinds of writing over the summer, and now I'm back to the chalkboard at back-to-school time. I was feeling a little down yesterday--had visited my folks outdoors, my \"down in the dumps\" mom who was (yay!) no longer down in the dumps, and came home feeling suspended, meaningless. It's the whole Covid thing, yes, the general isolation, the local worry from an extreme uptick in cases (related to college students returning*), and missing hugging, but I realized this morning that I always get a little nostalgic and sad at back to school time, because I'm not going back to school! And neither are my kids (grown). And neither are a lot of kids now. My heart goes out to all the teachers, students, and parents coping with the wild disruption and worry of school right now. Along with everything else.The chalkboard poems are another way to structure my day, my month. I rise early, write the poem on the board, often in first light, with the porch light on, take the Instagram photo, email it to myself, and arrange text with image at Facebook. It is cheering my online pals, and I'm glad of that, though not all poems are/will be cheerful. Some will be melancholy, like me, some stark, some with dark humor, and some with bright joy. The whole mix. A little blurry.I tend toward a haiku-like poem that will fit on the board, some depending heavily upon their titles. I say \"haiku-like\" because I learned later in life that haiku doesn't really have that 5-7-5 syllabic form we were taught in American grade schools. Nor titles! So mine will often be variations. I tend to write them during the day, or in my head during a walk, adjusting them in chalk, as needed. I got new \"dustless\" chalk over the summer to prepare for this, having used chalk stubs for the June poems. Perhaps these will grow more lush. The days continue to be beautiful. I ignore my indoor chores, though yesterday, guilt drove me indoors long enough to dust the living room surfaces, including my stacks of books and journals ready for the winter hibernation coming all too soon, perhaps with a second lockdown. (I've written that poem already and hope I don't have to use it.)* So there you have it, my first week of back-to-the-chalkboard poems, with pictures and invisibility.*Not all the students are to blame, of course. Just the ones who congregated hugely in parties as if no one would get sick, and ignoring the rules (the way I ignore my chores, slattern that I am). I'm pleased to see students walking around town now in masks. Thank you! As doom looms, let's be kind to one another."},
{"title": "Sealey Challenge, Day 31", "date": "Monday, August 31, 2020", "text": "What a month, what a challenge, and what a joy: to read a book of poems a day in August. Here they are! A big thank you to poet Nicole Sealey, who dreamed up this challenge to make sure people made time to read poetry! I'm glad to have made the time, and it was fascinating to see the connections I felt to the poems and poets, and the connections between the poems in the books. Today I met again fire, tornado, television, and elegy in Fimbul-Winter, by Debra Allbery (Four Way Books, 2020). Holy moly, do I know how to pick them or what? I put this one on the pile back in the super-hot days, thinking winter images might give me a little relief from the heat. But the weather changed, and it's gorgeous. And now I realized I've ended with Fimbul-Winter, aka Fimbulvetr of Norse mythology, \"the harsh winter that precedes the end of the world and puts an end to all life on Earth.\" Just what we need.*This was a cold book. It wasn't always winter in the book, but it always felt cold--and mysterious and haunted. \"Chronic Town\" describes \"that icebound city\" where:     In the library, the homeless slept upright     at long tables, gripping their open books.\"Of course, I watched some short training videos at work today on the homeless in the library. I worry about them this winter, if libraries have to close again, or have severely limited hours due to Covid. A Fimbulvetr, indeed.The post office is under siege but there are still letters in Allbery's poems! Letters to a lost love. \"This morning / I drove twelve miles just to mail a letter.\" And \"Sometimes I still address / envelopes to you, I even stamp them, / stand them empty, weightless on my desk.\" Well, that's a lonely image. It's in the poem \"Constellation\" (which is a letter, opening, \"Dear C--\"), where I learned more about Orion:     I know that Orion means foot-turning wanderer.     That Rigel, the brilliant star marking his left foot,     is actually two stars revolving around each other.I'm going to stand looking up at the sky tonight, for sure.In \"Firelands,\" I learned again about the mine fire, still burning, that wrecked an Ohio town and met up with two random coincidii: 1) I also have Ohio family connections and 2) I also propped up my window today with a stick of wood, similar to this:                                                       In summer,     propping up my bedroom window with a scrap     of plywood, the heft and heavy rattle of warped glass.My window is still propped open now, with crickets calling me out to see Rigel. In \"After Vermeer,\" the husband is up on the roof clearing out the gutters in the rain, in a dream, just like my husband, in waking life. And while I read this afternoon, the neighbor girl came out again, wildly singing in the breeze. It's September tomorrow and September in the poem \"The Wakeful Bird Sings Darkling,\" but it's still cold.     The sun could never find its way     to our windows; the walls were thick     as a bunker's, stolid, stone and stone     and stone.A bunker is a good place to wait out the end of the world, right? This is the September of 9/11, and she's home in their stone cottage with a sick baby:     That September morning's iris of sky just as fierce,     stripped and raw, too close; I shielded the baby     with my shadow. Then the quiet was tipped     by the ratchet of a kingfisher plummeting     from the power lines into the dark mirror     of our pond.This baby brings some welcome joy into her life and this book. \"Where is our laugh?\" he asks. \"Where does it live inside us?\" And so do \"[t]umbleweeds...wild as untethered joy...\" But this Fimbul-Winter feels cold throughout, even the fire moments, even the feverish moments, cleaving to its title and theme. I was astonished by the clarity, and a circling back, of this set of lines in Part 4, Death in the Woods, of \"In the Pines\":                                          The point     of the story is to keep her cold mystery,     keep that circle drawn around her     higher and higher, a glass wall, keep everyone     from getting any closer.*Also, I should maybe now watch Thor: Ragnorok, which is also about this, and to make it a Thor's Day on a Blue Monday, and, of course, a Poetry Someday and the recurring Random Coinciday in the blog. (Wait, does that movie poster say November 3?!** Aauughh!) Tomorrow I resume a previous project: chalkboard poems! The plan is a short poem a day on the green easel chalkboard beside my front stoop, poems posted at Facebook and Instagram, and I'll probably tell you about them sometimes here, too!**This movie is already out--came out in 2017, like several of the books I read!--but November 3 is looming as the end of the world, alas. Please, please vote, America, and save us all."},
{"title": "Turn Left Before Morning", "date": "Sunday, August 30, 2020", "text": "Whether on purpose or by accident, I keep reading the right book on the right day, adding to the pile up of random coincidii... Yesterday, I mentioned resting after gardening, with poetry, and today, in Zoom Church, the theme was rest, which I did not do. Instead, I brought up more boxes from the basement, recycled and rearranged, and took (much less) back downstairs in a (much more) waterproof way with (a little bit) more organization. Then I read Turn Left Before Morning, by April Salzano (Rattle, 2016), and wrote in my (new, as in, found in one of the boxes) little notebook, \"OMG, this woman can never rest!\"She's the mother of two sons, and her poems show her valiant efforts to be a good mom to both, in a life overtaken by the challenges of her son who has autism. She must be exhausted. She drops us into her life right away, with \"Maybe God,\" the first poem, which begins, \"Maybe God is in the broom closet / at my autistic son's elementary school...\" We see him in various grades, in diapers, naked running down the hall, with various frustrations and quiet joys. And her joy is there, too, in rare and brief glowing moments. There is so much straight talk in this, grief and annoyance, ambivalence, and love, love, love. \"I used to love dogs,\" she says in the poem \"Clarabel.\" \"Before kids and autism and bankruptcy and marriage and remarriage,\" and these troubles go on, until, \"I lost something, some fraction of the capacity to love.\" To love dogs, that is, \"to love just one more thing that needed loving.\" I get it, and it's OK. She's got her hands full, and there are plenty of dog lovers out there, and love to go around.This poem hit the spot for its title, \"Late Summer Sun,\" and opening reference, I think, to Stevie Smith's \"Not Waving but Drowning.\" Salzano begins:     I watch the trees outside the special school,     not waving but standing     still as any August. I am waiting     for the wide doors to slide open,     wheelchairs to be ushered forth     like carnival rides. I hold tight     to this latest pearl in a string      of promises, little hopes so easy to lose.Here, in this back-to-school time for many, Salzano has already tried many schools. And I see in her blog, that \"the new normal\" of Covid is a way of life--the isolation, missing the (old) normal, expected things--that she is already used to.I was struck by the turn that happens in \"And on the Other Hand,\" the turn toward joy, and how this also matches what Lucia Perillo says about how a poem takes a turn. To quote Perillo again for a moment:                                                    ...a poem, the tradition of which     pretty much demands that the reader be told off the bat     what a muckheap the world is. But then comes the swerve     where the poet flipflops or digresses     to come up with something that the muckheap     will surprise you with.And, as Salzano turns it,      Random fits of so much     joy your heart tears     and becomes two.And then she turns it again, in the nightmarish, \"Last Night I Ran Over My Autistic Son,\" so real I didn't know it was a nightmare. (Also because I know of a poet to whom this happened.) But this is where she \"turned left before / morning,\" thank God. And the struggles and heartbreaks and goofy moments and giggling and love were able to go on."},
{"title": "Oldest Map with the Name America", "date": "Saturday, August 29, 2020", "text": "Today I rose early, before dawn. Once it was light, I gardened--watering, weeding, clipping, collecting cosmos seeds in an envelope--because it was finally cool enough, breezy enough. Then I rested, and read The Oldest Map with the Name America; New and Selected Poems by Lucia Perillo (Random House, 1999). I first started reading her poems in the 1990s, when she lived part of the year in Washington state and part in Southern Illinois, where she taught. This book culls poems from Dangerous Life (1989) and The Body Mutinies (1996), giving many, many new poems in Part 3. The oldest map of the world that names America is a woodcut wall map in 12 panels by Martin Waldseemuller from 1507, where, as Perillo puts it, \"the world approximates that shape we call a heart.\"I've been surprised by the coincidences in what I've read this month--a few being the recurrence of mosh pits, kimonos, television shows, among them, Star Trek, fire--and how I've been choosing books with America in the title or in the cover image. It's as if I want America to be better, to be saved. \"Sometimes I feel history slipping from my body / like a guilty bone,\" says Perillo, and sometimes I feel that, too.But let me give you fragments again, the random coincidii, and the glorious search for beauty in \"The Revelation\" and other poems: \"you will find that beauty, a cataclysmic / beauty rising off the face of the burning landscape...\" Fire haunts me again as a reader here, and in \"La Vie en Rose,\" with Edith Piaf singing in the background in the car as her family flees a fire on the Jersey Turnpike. And in the beautiful \"Ghost Shirt,\" Perillo juxtaposes a visit to the Museum of Natural History in New York City with the LA Riots in reaction to the acquittal of the officers who beat up Rodney King, and New York's response. Alas, history is still slipping from the body of America like a guilty bone. The \"ghost shirt\" hangs there as a warning in the museum, and, in history, for Indian warriors who need to take up the fight:     A quote on the wall from the Paiute messiah     said Indians who don't believe in the ghost dance     will grow little, just about a foot high,     and stay that way. Then some of those     will be turned into wood and burned in fire--But at the end of the poem, after a fearful subway ride, she makes it safely home. \"And the only fires were the tiny flames / of people holding candles, outside the public library.\" Thanks for that vigil, and that location! But I'm ahead of myself.Perillo was a park ranger as well as a poet. She'd go up into the mountains to be alone and to listen:     One reason I went up there was because at sundown     when the wind climbed the back of the mountains     along with the spreading violet light,     you could hear the distinct murmuring that the Indians said     were the collective voices of the dead.I've heard that, too, in the wind of my own back yard. And speaking of mountains, another connection--to the purple mountains of the song but also to yesterday's Breathing Between the Lines, though, as Perillo notes, \"when you get there, the mountains are never purple.\"And in \"Palimpsest\" (a word I have to look up every single time*), I find again \"those seven thousand plastic ducks / shucked loose when their cargo ship broke up at sea,\" that I'd read about in the news, but forgotten for a while. And \"This I commit to memory forever: the command / I closed my eyes and forced myself to swallow like a hook\" so she wouldn't forget certain wonderful things. I've done that! But I kept my eyes open that beautiful, breezy summer day--a day like today!--in the yard of my family home with my dog, and I have never forgotten that moment, that day, that dog, Dulcie!*a piece of writing or art where the original has been erased or obscured by what came after; layers, as of history or nature working in this same way to cover but also possibly reveal what came before....I love that she likes Edward Hopper paintings, and has a poem about them (so do I!), specifically \"the women in Hopper's paintings,\" and how they are in natural poses, not poses at all like odalisques looking back over their shoulders, just natural women, really \"all share the body of his wife, Jo, whom he drew / often with a crumbly rust-colored crayon / called sanguine, I've learned: French for blood.\"Oh, I could go on and on with what I love, but I'll stop here, quoting a little bit from \"The Sportsmen's Guide,\" a poem in honor of the birth of her nephew:                                             ...Someday     you could even write a poem, the tradition of which     pretty much demands that the reader be told off the bat     what a muckheap the world is. But then comes the swerve     where the poet flipflops or digresses     to come up with something that the muckheap     will surprise you with.I hope so. We need some good surprises. Soon."},

Today it was Breathing Between the Lines, by Demetria Martinez (University of Arizona Press, 1997). This was a fascinating book of love poems, political poems, bilingual poems, poems immersed in language itself, with an essay at the end (linking it to the Poetry East: Origins anthology of poems with essays, and making it another Random Coinciday in the blog!) The essay is about process, yes, but also about the U.S. government taking her to court for her poem, \"Nativity, for Two Salvadoran Women,\" and for smuggling two pregnant women across the border with a Lutheran minister as part of a Sanctuary movement. She and the minister were acquitted, but it was a lengthy and grueling process. It stopped her writing, before it led to a novel, and poetry came back later still.As one of her poems is called \"Fragmentos/Fragments,\" I will also give you some fragments that stuck out for me for various reasons.From \"Milagros\": \"the time has come to storm heaven.\" This meant what it meant in its own context (\"after a painting by Francisco LeFebre\") and time, but it seems so timely now!I love how the title, \"Before You,\" sets up the first line of this poem: \"My poems had no you.\"In \"Everywoman,\" probably because of the food and because I was once in a play called The Clean House,\" these lines stuck out: \"All I want / is a clean house // Salsa on Muenster cheese / Pan dulce.\"Today, we need rain, it's hot, the air is heavy, so I reinterpret \"History\" for its present resonance: \"We prayed for rain / and the rain came.\" I hope it does, overnight!In \"We Talk About Spanish,\" a poem about language and love: \"I crossed over to him / Fearless as a spider,\" so I have to tell you I found a spider on this book, and it crossed over to me!In \"Translation from the Vietnamese,\" she \"hold[s] a poem up to the light     until it can be heard     above the detonations     in the crumpled silk of the jungle     a six-toned wood flute     the sound of one hand writing     down the worlds that survivedIn the fragments poem, she examines the difficulties of language, how it changes us:     In moments of grace,     poetry or prayer,     English uses me.     But most of the time, I use it.     I do not always like what I     have become in this tongue.Oh, I have to note the irony of these lines right now, from \"Wanted\": \"American your face is on wanted posters in post offices.\" Or should be. \"Remember remember who you are America / Purple mountain majesty above fruited plains / worked by mejicanos.\"And as the summer cicadas sing in my own back yard, I love this unique image: \"cicadas hum like / gourds on ankles of pueblo dancers.\" What a month I'm having, learning so much through poetry!"},

You can find them at Dave Bonta’sVia Negativa and learn here about how she used his short musings at his Morning Porch as prompts for poems! Check & Balance (Locofo Chaps, animprint of Moria Books, 2017) gave me the news of the day, which is all toopertinent still—hatred and expulsion of immigrants in “Color Theme” and in “Restriction,”about how the US denied visas to the “first / all-female soccer team fromTibet,” alas! “The sign once said ‘guest,’ / but I read ghost,”begins one such poem. Therewas a poem about the “Thrilla in Manila” fight of Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier,with an internal refrain of “anything can happen.” Indeed! Andthere is the beautiful anchor of the title poem, where people come forward tohelp a man in the station who has fallen on the escalator. Everyone, withwhatever is at hand, comes to help!                                               All this     happened swiftly, with very fewwords     exchanged—only the movement of hands     and bodies wanting to save:strangers     lifting the stricken one…. Isighed in astonishment and relief! TheCheck & Balance cover image aboveis ©2017, Nash Tysmans, a photograph taken in Kalinga, Philippines. The coverart for haori (Tea & TatteredPages #2, 2017) is by Jennifer Patricia A. Cariño, for this hand-stitchedchapbook. A haori is a kimono-likeJapanese jacket. I so love learning things in poems. Letme give you some beautiful lines from the poems in haori!  They come from a sectioned poem called \"Arguments with Destiny\":  \"The commercial said Love does not comfort. Perhaps not by itself / is what they mean; perhaps the topof the piano must come up.\" Ihave not seen this commercial. Maybe there is a piano in it! But I took itmetaphorically, and also Emily Dickinson-ly, feeling the lines take the top ofmy head off, as in all real poetry! Like this:     The day we looked for my mother     was the day she refused to be found. Oh,how grief begins! But let me end with this excerpt from “Arguments withDestiny,” since it is another terribly hot day in terribly hard times:      The fig and the plum burst     out of their skins because heat     has unstitched them, not     because their hearts constrict     from a sadness they cannot bear."},
{"title": "What Keeps Us Here", "date": "Monday, August 24, 2020", "text": "Today, in the cool comfort of my home office, because it was too hot outside, I read What Keeps Us Here, by Allison Joseph (Ampersand Press, 1992). This must be a re-read, as all the sweetness, particular candies, and images of \"Penny Candy\" came rushing back to me, but I probably didn't read it back in 1992, when I had a two-year-old and was in graduate school. I remembered vividly. too, the innocent thrill of \"[f]our brown skinned young girls\" discovering their naked bodies in a basement in the poem \"Accomplices.\" And the sorrow of losing her mother to cancer. Probably different things took hold of me this time. This time, I was struck, in \"Endurance,\" by these two lines: \"I should say this plainly: / a woman, dying, seeks God.\" Yes, so plain, so strong. And the terrible, beautiful, true moment, in \"At That Moment,\" of learning of her mother's death by telephone while away at school. This one connects with a story told yesterday, on Zoom, of when our family friend learned of her father's death by phone while staying with my parents. She wailed all night long, and my mother sat up with her. And, in Joseph's poem, \"They put me to rest / in the narrow dorm bed, / my room now strange, unfamiliar...\" The disorientation of trauma, of grief.Later, some comfort from \"The Idiot Box.\" I was glad to see again \"Lucy bawling after Ricky, The Odd Couple / clashing, Spock and Captain Kirk / on the flimsy set of the Enterprise\" via reruns on late-night tv. Then the poems \"Falling Out of History,\" its content and its epigraph by James Baldwin, and \"Broadside: from Decade's End\" connect to my side-by-side nonfiction reading this week: We Were Eight Years in Power, by Ta-Nehisi Coates. I have just finished his essay on Malcolm X, and here in Joseph's book I read:     First day freshman year,     I saw two other black faces,     was dumbfounded later when     a roommate asked, What's lynching?     her eyes lifted from Malcolm X's story.But back to life in the tender and fleeting moment. I love this imagery in \"Rationale,\" a poem about visiting \"the fire-singed tenement\" of an old lover:     Now we're nervous memorabilia:     letters, cards, one pressed flower,     colorless. Wanting you, I'm skittish,     quick as a hand of three card monte.And my heart is breaking at the beautiful lovemaking \"keeping us here just one moment / longer\" (love that line break!) in \"Preservation\" and risky nights of \"In Fear of Sleep\": \"I may seem frail, but it's / you who fights, who could / blink away before I could // do anything.\" The fragility of life so present:     you might not wake--your breath     stopping dozens of times     throughout the night, heart     thudding to keep you alive.In \"What Keeps Us Here\" are lines that remind us that we slip away:                        Soon you'll sleep,     close your eyes to drift     through its uneasy thoroughfares,     its way stations and islands     of dream, terrain where your footing     slips, balance sliding out     from under you.I wish Allison well in her ongoing grief, and thank her for these poems."},
{"title": "Vasectomania", "date": "Sunday, August 23, 2020", "text": "Vasectomania by Matthew Guenette (University of Akron Press, 2017) is simultaneously hilarious and melancholy, confessional and philosophical, tender and irreverent, so I loved it! I read my copy outside (like the cover image) in the cool, partly cloudy morning. It's an inscribed copy (!) from when I brought Matt Guenette back to Normal, where I had first met him, to read with Matthew Murrey in the Poetry is Normal Presents reading series at the Normal Public Library. It was the day of two Matthews, which, as the poem \"Mountain Goats\" reveals, has happened before: \"My roommates / were all named Matt.....Matts and more Matts / like a clown car of roommates...\" (I wrote about the other Matthew here.)The poems are about the glories and horrors of marriage, parenting, and adulthood--hence, the humor, plus a lot of diapers. Random coincidii abound. For example, from the poem \"Bastille Day,\" the lines \"For the way we refrain / from eating our young\" connected to a review I just read in a recycled (to me) New Yorker, about the movie Mr. Jones and the book Red Famine by Anne Applebaum, who wrote about Stalin's starvation policy in the Ukraine. Reviewer Anthony Lane says, \"Some parents consumed their offspring, survived, and, having woken to the realization of what they had done, went mad.\" Guenette only does this metaphorically, with Cheerios and a (broken) vacuum cleaner, sometimes screaming at a clogged toilet.I loved lines like, \"Even a cat will eat Bugles,\" found in the poem \"Communion.\" (My communion this morning, during Zoom Church, was, as usual, gummy vitamins and water, this time with lemon slices floating in it.) Followed by, \"Even smoke flies into clarity,\" which made my eyes water, and relates to my ongoing fire worries, though I am happy to report that, during a Zoom 67th Anniversary Celebration for my parents yesterday, my California brother, whose neighbor had reassured him, was able to report, \"Our house is still there.\" Followed by Guenette's understanding that he will                                                          still eat a Twinkie           with that god-knows-what holding it together,     its shelf life like a communion wafer     near to the promise of forever.I loved \"Nostalgia\" with its tough mother and possibility of vacuum repair. I loved \"3 a.m.\" with its \"hamster wheel\" insomnia and worries about \"our gun lust // and privilege.\" I loved its \"anthropomorphized animals\" (you've seen pictures of my back yard) and shared fears: \"Then I go home & wait / for the end of the world.\" I loved \"Adjustable Beds,\" a mother dream with \"swirling galaxies\" in it. And I loved \"Holland\" for his sexy, farting wife and how tulips (their bulbs) can \"[c]ook up like onions,\" which my mother did once, accidentally."},
{"title": "Let's All Die Happy", "date": "Saturday, August 22, 2020", "text": "California is burning, Covid-19 proceeds unchecked, and twin hurricanes are headed to the Gulf of Mexico to hit land next week, so I chose this book for today, for the strange cheer and dark comedy of its title: Let's All Die Happy, by Erin Adair-Hodges (University of Pittsburgh Press, 2017). I gasped when I opened the book and read its epigraph by Bruno Schulz, because I had just encountered him that morning while reading An Unnecessary Woman, by Rabih Alameddine! Alignments and coincidences keep happening. I'm sure I'll tell you about more.Well, here's one: hurricanes. In her poem \"Pilgrimage,\" full of beauty I'll let you discover when you get this book for yourself, I find \"goodbyes distinctive / and precious as hurricanes.\" Speaking of goodbyes, oh, \"Seeing Ex-Boyfriends\" has such an excellent ending, and here's an excellent title for you: \"A Murder of Librarians.\" Plenty of disasters, including asteroids taking out the dinosaurs in \"Natural History,\" but plenty of joy, too, as when her little son is delighted by that! \"His fingers turn claws as the film / starts again and we wait for his favorite part, / the hungry meat, in the sky a coming fire.\" I needn't mention the coincidence of fire. Sigh...but I did. And in \"Rough Math,\" \"I...want your grief / to pour from your eyes like smoke...But, \"Let's all die happy.\" That's the first line of another poem with a wonderful title, \"Everybody in the Car / We Are Leaving without You,\" which sounds like a familiar threat, and a real invitation. Here I particularly love the hooking up of the Mother and Father of American Poetry:                                ...Let's set Whitman     & Dickinson up on a date & watch     as the awkwardness flames.Aauggh, flames again! Here's a tender coincidence instead. In a scene I read this morning in the novel, a music box is important in a mother-daughter relationship. It's also part of the mother-daughter relationship in the poem \"The Robin Tanka,\" used as an aural image: \"Her voice is a music box / grown tired of being turned.\" My attentiveness to connection, alignment, and coincidence keeps happening, as does my commitment to this reading of a poetry book a day in August. It has felt like work, but work I love, schoolwork (and I loved school), homework, even, in a weird way, holy work. So, of course, in her poem \"The Last Judgment,\" I find the phrase, \"His Holy Homework.\" This work is getting me through, giving me joy, and I hope giving you some joy, too.Now let me leave you with a few lines from her poem, \"Twelve\":     Though I am not strong     I want to be. I'm getting worn down     by the weakness I see."},
{"title": "Painting Rain", "date": "Friday, August 21, 2020", "text": "Speaking of bookmarks, as I was yesterday, the one in Painting Rain, by Paula Meehan (Carcanet, 2009) is a fuchsia-colored Hodges Figgus Loyalty Card, from a Dublin bookshop, with its first number stamped (out of ten). My mother brought it back to me from a trip to Ireland. She had asked the proprietor for a good book by a contemporary Irish poet for her daughter and accepted the Loyalty Card, though this would be her only likely visit. I've been reading this one for years, in my usual, much slower poetry-reading method, except for the Sealey Challenge, which asks of us a poetry book a day in August, so I resumed at the bookmark and backed up to re-read, er, backwardsly.While I was reading, in the shade, in the lovely breeze, a little neighbor girl came into her back yard, singing wild syllables (perhaps through a toy microphone?) while swinging in her hammock. In the poem \"Cora, Auntie,\" one of several tender elegies, the speaker is remembering her aunt, at twenty, having red sequins sewn into the hem of her white dress as she stood on the kitchen table: \"I orbit the table I can barely see over. / I am under it singing.\" This is the first coincidence, singing, happening in the moment of reading. The second is red sequins, saved in a little tin box. I have to tell you I found red sequins in a margarine tub going through the kids' toys and craft supplies a few days ago. To quote Meehan, \"which I open now in memory--/ the coinage, the sudden glamour....\"In the elegy, \"In Memory, Joanne Breen\" a memory comes from the colors of yarn:     I am fingering a length of yarn     from the mill at Stornoway.     It is green as a summer meadow     though when I untwine it widdershins     I see, spun into the yarn, fibres of blue     & yellow & purple, occasionally orange.     I am undoing the magic of the spindle,     Unravelling.The poem \"Shoes,\" also a death poem, connects to yesterday's \"Widow in Red Shoes,\" by Tess Gallagher, but here it is the earth that is red. It's winter, but     I put on your summer shoes.     They smelt of the red red earth     Where lemons grow, where olives grow.All kinds of life enters these poems, even the elegies--family life, community life. Some are commissions for public events. \"Quitting the Bars\" suggests some trouble with addiction, as does the strangely delightful \"Note from the Puzzle Factory,\" about maxing out a credit card to buy cell phones for all her friends \"so they could keep in touch / day or night. With me.\"      Nobody rang. Nobody rang.     Imagine. Not a soul. Not a sinner.     I sat in my room thinking on this.     Then I up and signed myself in.And the students in her Coleridge class at the Recovery through Art, Drama, and Education Project are deeply interested not so much in his Kubla Khan poem, as in Coleridge's own health complaint, constipation, as they recognize it from their own opiate addiction.Many beauties, delights, and surprises in this book. I remember \"conkers\" from my year in England, a toy made from two chestnuts, for whirling and conking together, but in \"Common Sense,\" all the young chestnut trees are dying, as kids have stripped away their bark while collecting their conkers. \"We don't deserve this earth I sometimes think / and yet the children acted from ignorance.\" They had not yet acquired common sense. This poem begins with    A murmuration of starlings in a rowan tree    mid-August berry feast    and berries raining down upon my head.Here in America, the rowan tree is called the Mountain Ash. Mid-August now, school begun in its halting way, but the poem reminded me of grade school, a girl who died over the summer, and how we planted a Mountain Ash on the school lawn for her. And as I worry about family and friends in the midst of the California wildfires, I encounter \"the scouring power of fire / in this the fire season...\"So I'll turn back to brave \"Cora, Auntie,\"     always a girl in her glance     teasing Death--humour a lance     she tilted at Death."},
{"title": "Portable Kisses", "date": "Thursday, August 20, 2020", "text": "Gorgeous day, and I needed comfort, so I read Portable Kisses, by Tess Gallagher (Capra Press). Actually I read Portable Kisses Expanded, a later edition. I must have picked up my copy at the library book sale. It has a yellow sales slip in it from its original owner that I used as a bookmark. The slip is dated Sept. 29, 1996. My son was six. An earlier edition came out in 1994, when he was four, and I had my daughter that year. I had no idea Tess Gallagher was writing kiss poems, because I was too busy with the results of my own kissing! From reading the poems, I know children were desired but did not come in her own life. From reading the introduction, I now know there was a smaller, limited edition of Portable Kisses back in 1978, when I was still in college, and she had not yet met her great love, Raymond Carver.The random coincidii: Tess Gallagher is also in Poetry East: Origins, the one I wrote about yesterday. Her poem \"I Stop Writing the Poem\" always moves me so much, as well as her brief essay. It's about folding clothes, one of her husband's shirts. She was widowed by then, and still liked to wear his shirt. I saw the folding as a kind of embrace. It's a short poem, so if I quote the end, it's almost half the poem, but you see how it's also about women's lives and how they help each other through them:          I'll get back to being     a woman. But for now     there's a shirt, a giant shirt     in my hands, and somewhere a small girl     standing next to her mother     watching to see how it's done.As in Poetry East, she provides an essay; this one tells how she got Portable Kisses Expanded. She wanted to make it a small, truly portable book like a small edition of Merwin's translations of Neruda's love poems that she used to read while waiting in line at the bank or the post office. The first edition was not really a slip-in-your-pocket kind of book, but this one, even though it had more poems, was!  \"I conceived of the book in mottled tones--the whimsical alongside the passionate, the panoramic with the close-up, and always the intimacy of the vignette, often simply of a man and a woman speaking quietly to each other in a room.\"And that's exactly what it is, with wonderfully erotic moments, lusty moments, humor, passion, and kisses personified, as in \"The Kiss Gets a New Bonnet\" and \"The Kiss Joins the CIA.\" And grief as a golden thread throughout.\"Widow in Red Shoes\" shows us \"[a] quiet gathering of a few old friends, / my first time with some of them / since his death.\" Getting ready, she finds some favorite red shoes of the 60's. \"Already they have the look / of something misunderstood.\" But she wears them:          He always loved      me in these red shoes. Defiant, sexy     and with him.The yellow sales slip shows this book belonged to someone who also bought beads and rings. I bet she liked the red shoes, too.There's another Poetry East: Origins / kisses connection, as Ross Gay's poem is about \"a goldfinch kissing / a sunflower.\" It's as sexy as Tess Gallagher's poem \"Sugarcane\"--sugar cane is also one of the recent coincidences here in the blog. It reminded me that you have to bite the cane first, to get at the juice, and then suck hard.While I was reading, a squirrel was eating nuts out of my hand."},
{"title": "Origins", "date": "Wednesday, August 19, 2020", "text": "Today, to calm myself, I read the new issue of Poetry East, edited by Richard Jones, a compilation of three previous Origins issues, plus a fourth new one, so it's like four wonderful chapbooks, a fine anthology of poems and brief essays on how they came to be. Two of the previous issues are sold out, so this resurrects them in a way! I keep Poetry East #43, the first Origins issue, at my writing desk, on a shelf above my computer, along with other inspiring books. You can order Poetry East here. I read outside in the beautiful, breezy sunshine on a comforter on the wooden glider in my own back yard, my phone at hand. It was like a perfect northern California day, except that California is having 100-degree temperatures and wildfires, and that's what I'm worried about, as I have family there. My son woke to ash on his car and a weather app that said today's weather was \"Smoke.\" My brother's family has evacuated but is safe tonight. Hoping for the best in these terribly scary times.So I will just give you some beautiful covers, lines, and sentences. And, of course, some random coincidii. To start with the random: this time the pineapple is a coconut. That is, in my other readings this month, we've had various exotic fruits: pineapple more than once, pomelo, sugar cane (I think this is a grass). In Paul Hostovsky's poem \"Coconut,\" a coconut means happiness to his little son.Dave Nielsen, \"In a Poem About My Father\": \"It is perhaps better done in a painting / or in the language that a fire speaks.\"Ross Gay, in \"Wedding Song,\" his essay for \"Wedding Poem\": \"It is the case that so many of our delights we must be alerted to, and I think it is the case that, if we can, we ought to alert others of them as well. It's called sharing what you love, and we're good at it, but it also requires practice.\" I sure hope I am practicing that here, sharing what I love. What Gay loved was a goldfinch kissing a sunflower, another form of happiness.Ruth Stone, essay for \"Second-Hand Coat\": \"Those endless closets and halls in the brain where the unknown hides; that open for a moment and then close again. That is where poems come from.\"Joseph Stroud, \"Grief\": \"Went to the Wailing Wall of the Jerusalem within me.\"Peter Meinke, \"The Dead Tree\": \"nature includes its dead.\"Morton Marcus, from the poem \"The Mirror\":     It is as though he stares into another room,     a room where he has never been, and is not known,     and can observe his mother glancing from his magazine     to his father seated like a stranger in a railroad car     and the old man pulling at the pillow threads     like a furious harpist who cannot sit still.And from his essay on \"The Mirror\": \"...and he is looking at them but facing forward, away from them, which, since he is a youth and they are members of the previous two generations, suggest that he is looking toward the future. But if he is facing the future, he is simultaneously aware of the past in the form of the three people behind him. Thus a continuum of experience, of one generation following another, is being described...\" as it was in my musings yesterday, with toys and Generation Z. Alas! But I do love being aware of how things connect, and so I am sharing what I love."},
{"title": "Scald", "date": "Tuesday, August 18, 2020", "text": "Today, again, I set out the children's toys, now reduced in number, to let them get some sun and fresh air on the glider, while I read Scald, by Denise Duhamel (University of Pittsburgh Press, 2017). It is a grand feminist adventure and tribute to three women, Shulamith Firestone (1945-2012), Andrea Dworkin (1946-2005), and Mary Daly (1928-2010). The opening poem, \"How Deep It Goes,\" is both a fabulous romp into feminist history (and hence human history) and a deep philosophical excavation of \"how deep it goes,\" all of it: sexism, social injustice, the inequities of being human when some people think they are more human than others. The book remains hilarious and deep, and Duhamel is way smarter and more imaginative than her smart phone. When it autocorrects her name as Denise Richards, she imagines a whole new life as Charlie Sheen's ex. Anything can happen in a poem by Denise Duhamel.I loved learning about T. dohrnii in her poem \"The Immortal Jellyfish,\" about many things but also the ability to \"go back to childhood\" after reaching sexual maturity, \"from parent to infant and then back again...When the jellyfish lifts its umbrella body inside out, the past is the future, the future the past.\" Kind of like what I've been doing, reviewing old papers and lining up the kids' toys. This one is a prose poem, some are free verse, and many are pantoums (as in American Gun) and villanelles. And there's an amazing \"braided poem\" that indeed braids together three generations of experience through popular culture.Then there's the poem \"Reading,\" which, of course, I love, and which is also about writing, the reader who gets the writer. It starts out, \"Sometimes I read pages of books without retaining anything,\" which also happens to me--maybe because it's a beautiful breezy day of windchimes and butterflies and a goldfinch, or maybe I'm preoccupied with politics, pandemic, and death. But books are saving me right now, and I'm glad this was one of them.     Only a few people will come to the dive     where you once danced, or turn to the page     where you left some marks, look at the words you wrote.     Fewer still will read them. Then a mixture      of vanity and humility if a stranger understands.The title Scald comes from \"Scalding Cauldron,\" an abecedarian (plays with the alphabet) prose poem about \"Crackpot Crones,\" among others. \"Let's scold and scald. Let's be Skalds--poets who write of heroic deeds. (Her heroes are women!) \"The End is Coming\" felt awfully close, and also related to Isaac's Storm, about a horrific hurricane, but it's true that some survived! As some of us will survive..., but to go back to the braided poem: \"All of us project ourselves onto the perils of Generation Z / and the end of the alphabet...\" I did pause, look up, and worry about Generation Z, and ask myself why we had imagined the end of the alphabet for our descendants. And now there's this pandemic, horrific American presidency, derecho, and the inland hurricane that devastated Iowa.You should see/listen to \"Crickets,\" by Dave Bonta, here."},
{"title": "Our List of Solutions", "date": "Monday, August 17, 2020", "text": "Well, this was a fun one. Our List of Solutions, by Carrie Oeding (42 Miles Press, 2011). I read it too quickly because it has a lovely rambling, conversational quality, funny, with surprises, and sometimes lonely and sad, too. I have lots of favorites lines--I could make a list of them! But it would be too long, and it wouldn't solve anything, but here's one: \"I want to make something beautiful out of the everyday.\" So do I, Carrie Oeding. I love your titles, too, and your impulse to make lists. \"Prelude to How the World Works\" starts with this line: \"Envy the list, its certainty of what's needed in the To-Do.\" I wrote a to-do list yesterday and did not look at it once. Instead, I looked at old letters and the lost world, and today I'm exhausted. Today I brought the kids' stuffed-animal toys up from the basement to air out and sort, deciding what to save and what to toss. I texted pictures of them, all arrayed on the glider and chairs on the patio, to the kids, and they chose favorites (circling them magically on their phones) and I chose more, and figured out I can actually wash some of them on gentle in little mesh bags. Of course, \"It is better I included toys,\" says Carrie Oeding, about what she might plant, in her poem, \"Coming in From the Garden While I Think of Going Back.\" Yep, that makes it a Random Coinciday, as well as a Blue Monday in the blog, and a Poetry Someday, specifically  #SealeyChallenge Day 17.More favorite lines:\"My friends say I don't mention my friends enough. Give us names!\"\"Dancing is one way to have joy.\"\"Oh boys and men, I'm sorry, / my back turning has nothing to do with you.\"\"Apology to Meditation,\" a title, and the long sentence in the center that does exactly what I do while meditating, so, likewise, Sorry, Meditation!I loved reading the poem \"Storm's A'Comin\" while realizing I would need to load up the toys soon and take them in, as my phone was giving me a weather warning, and the other book I am reading is Isaac's Storm, by Erik Larson, about the hurricane that devastated Galveston in 1900. I was reading a weather statement about winds unlikely to rotate, but, hey, a funnel was sighted in LaSalle County... Also, there is a pineapple in this poem, as in several I have encountered this month in various random books I am reading. The \"Prelude to How the World Works\" contains a list of questions and a list of answers that don't exactly line up, just like the world! And this delightful answer: \"A: While considering leaving, look on page 66.\" You know I did. And I found the poem \"And That is How the World Works.\" It was lovely to read a winsome book with friends and neighbors in it. (She gives some of them names!) To go \"Dancing in Shorty's Bar.\" To discover \"Sandy's List of Solutions.\"Here's another favorite line: \"I could live next door to disappointment.\" And another, from \"Morning Song for the Porch Light\": Still on, you greet the sun with your uselessness....\""},
{"title": "The Lost World", "date": "Sunday, August 16, 2020", "text": "Today I read The Lost World, by Randall Jarrell, for Day 16 of the #SealeyChallenge. It was first published in 1965, in March, and Jarrell died in October of 1965, hit by a car, as Mary Jarrell states in her Foreword to the 1985 edition, the one I read, with a Maurice Sendak cover. (Some think Jarrell's death was a suicide, but Mary doesn't.)It wasn't the book I had intended to read today; it was the perfect one, the one I chose in a nostalgic mood, after a day of recovering a bit of my own lost world, and letting a lot of it go. It was a beautiful morning, and the urge came upon me to use the lovely summer day to bring up boxes from the basement, go through musty old papers in the sunshine, and see what should be recycled, and what saved. And so I may tell you more about me than the poems. Perhaps I've been doing that all along. I'll start with the random coincidii.In the boxes were cards, postcards, and letters from my early years in Chicago, not long after graduating from Kenyon College, when I was still corresponding with Kenyon classmates. Randall Jarrell taught at Kenyon, which is mentioned in the book in the Appreciation by Robert Lowell, also reprinted from 1965.The Lost World contains a couple poems from The Bat-Poet (another book with Sendak illustrations), and I directed a Readers' Theatre production of it, and once performed in it (when the actor playing the bat got sick). I love those poems. In the poem called \"The Lost World,\" Randall Jarrell reconnects with his childhood, his grandparents, as I did today, finding their birthday cards to me, as well as my children's childhood, through their toys and crafts and handmade cards.In Jarrell's poem \"Hope,\" there's a linden tree. I used to climb a linden tree, and grew up on Linden Street Road, out in the country. In \"Next Day,\" a woman feels sad about getting old. I even discovered a connection to yesterday's reading, where Robin Coste Lewis, in cataloging art objects, finds a clock that is a woman. In The Lost World, \"a grandfather's     Clock with the waist and bust of a small     But unusually well-developed woman     Is as if invented by Chagall.In several poems, Jarrell speaks as a woman, with great empathy and insight. \"The Lost Children\" contains his wife Mary's dream and her memories. But the long poem \"Woman\" feels old-fashioned, trapped in the 20th century, with Freud.The last poem, \"Thinking of the Lost World,\" did make me cry. \"Or if only I could find...,\" he says, naming a favorite toy, a remembered car, the plot of the dinosaur movie extended in his imagination. As if he could recreate his world through just a few objects or souvenirs.     All of them are gone     Except for me; and for me nothing is gone--It was a little the same for me, as I handled the letters and notes, lanyards and lace, rick rack, toys, buttons, shells, tiny objects saved to glue together into new things. Except for me, a few more things are gone."},
{"title": "Voyage of the Sable Venus", "date": "Saturday, August 15, 2020", "text": "When I first started reading this book--maybe five years ago, when it first came out?--I sensed it might take me years to read, so rich it is in history and mythology, human experience, art, and ideas. Yet today, I also read it straight through in various places in the happiness of my own back yard on a hot August day in 2020, the year of hindsight and horror. Voyage of the Sable Venus, by Robin Coste Lewis (Alfred A. Knopf, 2015), is a wonderful and challenging journey, containing other journeys within it, and speakers who contain multitudes, so that time kept folding over itself, and skies kept darkening and clearing my mind as I read it. The center section is the central \"Voyage of the Sable Venus,\" a poem collage of \"titles, catalog entries, or exhibit descriptions of Western art objects in which a black female figure is present, dating from 38,000 BCE to the present.\" See what I mean?That particular poem, requiring lots of research, is dedicated to \"the legacy of black librarianship, and black librarians, worldwide.\" I love the cover image, the photograph called Window Shopping, taken by Eudora Welty. I have a whole book of her photographs, and this one's in it! Voyage of the Sable Venus brings my summer reading projects together: #SealeyChallenge, a poetry book a day in August, and educating myself in racism and anti-racism by reading Black authors. The very first poem, \"Plantation,\" brought me back to Octavia Butler and Kindred, where a woman time travels to a plantation. Then in the poem \"Félicité\" we learn, \"The black side of my family / owned slaves,\" words she doesn't want to say. Her black ancestor, Marie Panis, a freed woman, became the owner of a plantation as part of the territorial negotiations with Spain, France, and the United States. She gave to her son \"her 'favorite' slave: a girl named Félicité.\"The poem later asks, \"How / does one name a slave Happiness?\"This is a book full of wonders: a water buffalo gives birth to a stillborn calf \"On the Road to Sri Bhuvaneshwari\" in the land created when Shiva dropped the Goddess Parvati, charred and in pieces, from the sky. A woman (in art) is a working clock. A woman holds her child above her \"Out of Reach / Of a Serpent // \"Climbing Up / Her Dress.\" So many strong, amazing, compromised, bloody women. In \"Art & Craft,\" the poet as a child figures out how to hide her own intelligence and talent, so not to stand out and draw attention to herself or her family. In the heartbreaking \"Lure,\" she learns how not to be there, dissociated from her body to preserve herself from abuse by an elder. And in \"The Body in August,\" everything comes full circle, \"Because when I was a child, God would pull me up into Her lap,\" and then, \"Because when God became a small child, I pulled Her up into my lap.\"And here's a wonderful stanza from \"Pleasure & Understanding\":     All is suffering is a bad modernist translation.        What the Buddha really said is: It's all a mixed bag. Shit     is complicated. Everything's fucked up. Everything's gorgeous. Even        Death contains pleasure--six feet below understanding.And, speaking of full circle, and pleasure & understanding, I go back to the first poem, \"Plantation,\" where I encountered a sensory memory from my own childhood--\"the fresh, pleasant taste / of juiced cane,\" though the cane juice I tasted as a child was sucked straight from a chunk of fresh cane."},
{"title": "Body My House", "date": "Friday, August 14, 2020", "text": "Today I read Body My House, by Bethany Reid (Goldfish Press, 2018), for the #SealeyChallenge, Day 14. \"Body my house\" comes from the poet May Swenson, and Swenson snippets open each section of Reid's book, which is a celebration of the body, down to its aches and pains, and of the soul and heart, too! In \"The Body Stands Waiting,\" \"The body / like a housewife opens its blinds / to let in the light.\"Lots of animals and their bodies in here, too: horses, goats, sheep, dogs, cats, a pretty scary parrot, other birds, even the green of an iguana. I was delighted to discover that some of the proceeds from this book go to a goat sanctuary, and that such a thing even exists!I love \"Her Desk,\" that unfolds for us the poet's connection to her desk's previous owner: \"maybe, she, too, was hard to love, / craved quiet more // than husband and children.\" I connect, too, always craving quiet, though not, these days, more than husband and children...Part 2, Take Heart, is one long, sectioned poem, riffing on the heart, as in \"her heart / is a room full of old books.\" Again, I connect! Or, \"Her heart unfolds, a blue heron...\" in a section that continues until:                                  Take wing,          she whispers, a peculiar                    incantation of the verb---          as if she had said, Take heart.Part 3 is Living in Books. Again, yep! I connect. I laughed out loud at the epigraph to the poem \"When Poems Sit Vacant,\" which is:          When poems sit vacant for a long time,           they can attract squatters.                                                    --real-estate story misheard on KUOW      I know from just reading If It Bleeds, particularly the last novella, Rat, that Stephen King would connect with the poem titled \"If Plot Is What Happens\" and continues \"then what about those long, still moments / when nothing happens?\" Good question!There's another good question in \"Her Heart, Her Soul,\" the last poem, that starts by giving a list of things of this world (colors, animals, a \"bright feather\") and then asks, \"What if the soul           is no more than these? Less--          the colors of sunset          reflected in water, foam          on a horse's lip after a gallop.          Vestigial, intransigent.Well, I leave it to you.New Moon Farm Sanctuary Peekaboo Banner!"},
{"title": "American Gun", "date": "Thursday, August 13, 2020", "text": "American Gun arrived in the mail today, so of course I sat down in the back yard and read it straight through, acknowledgements, writer bios, and all, for the Sealey Challenge, Day 13, while feeding nuts to a squirrel and listening to the breeze in the windchimes. It is a beautiful book on a horrific subject--gun violence--and truly a collaborative effort. American Gun is A Poem by 100 Chicagoans, edited by Chris Green (Big Shoulders Books, 2020). Big Shoulders Books is a publishing unit at DePaul University.This book is free, and you can get it here, at Big Shoulders Books, in a variety of ways. \"The editors ask that by taking a copy, you agree to support groups working on anti-violence efforts in Chicago.\" There's a list of organizations in the back, or you can choose your own. I belong to a local chapter of Moms Demand Action, part of a national organization working to reduce gun violence by raising awareness, teaching gun safety, and promoting sensible gun legislation. Chicago is having a hellish summer of gun violence, and I'll also use the book's list to target some extra help there. (Aauugh, \"target.\")The group poem is a pantoum, a form with repeating lines that \"mirror the semi-automatic firing of a weapon and also the seemingly endless cycle of shootings in Chicago,\" says editor Chris Green. \"However,\" he goes on, 'the main title of this poem, American Gun, points to the gun epidemic as not simply a Chicago problem, but an American one.\" Indeed.The poets writing together here, each composing two new lines while incorporating two lines given by another poet (as required by the pantoum form), include many I crossed paths with when I lived in Chicago: Tara Betts, cin salach, Jan Bottiglieri, Richard Jones, Valerie Wallace, Nina Corwin, Mike Puican, Mary Hawley, Barry Silesky, Virginia Bell, Patricia McMillen, Edward Hirsch, and I bet I missed some, as the poets' names are vertical beside the horizontal stanzas. Oh, and sometimes you must turn the book sideways to read the stanzas with long lines, a marvelous part of the book's design.Here's a gorgeous stretch of heartbeat, heartbreaks, and horror that reveals the pantoum form, verses 46-49, written by these 4 poets in order, Marty McConnell, Joshua Carey, Edward Hirsch, and Christina Pugh.     Each heart-beat timed, a ricochet,     a holy echo. It's hard to remember our names,     hard to breathe, take cover, bolt away     from what's said of us through unfamiliar lips.     A holy echo. It's hard to remember our names     drowned by lead's loud whispering     from what's said of us through unfamiliar lips.     Run, hide, fight the false equivalents     drowned by lead's loud whispering     whispering a holy echo wholly unholy.     Run, hide, fight the false equivalents     to God, unholy god, who has withdrawn     Whispering a holy echo wholly unholy,     the device reverberates from human cochlea     to God, unholy god, who has withdrawn     his sinuous heavens far from America.The book is printed on black and white pages, mostly black print on white pages, but also some white print on black pages, with red dot accents like drops of blood. Some words and phrases become images, echoes like gun reports or reverberations on facing pages. This, like the sideways pages, is the work of the book designer, Natalie Bontumasi, whose \"creativity and expertise transformed American Gun into a visual poem,\" as praised by editor Chris Green.Some of the wonderful poets in this book weren't even born when I left Chicago 20 years ago! They are the 16- and 17-year-old student poets whose words and experience are essential to American Gun. I loved reading everyone's bios as well as their stanzas. And this is definitely a contemporary pantoum, which admits variation from exact repetition (though most of the repetition is exact), allowing the poem to move forward (or sideways!) as needed.Even if a single line sometimes stands out--\"we could be alive to something better,\" written by Cecelia Pinto in her stanza and repeated by Larry Janowski in his (and I noticed those lines were often mirrored on the facing page by the designer!)--this is a beautiful sharing, truly a group effort. Sensible gun legislation is a group effort, too, and so is ending gun violence. Let's do it, together!"},
{"title": "Ecstatic Destinations", "date": "Wednesday, August 12, 2020", "text": "What a lovely book, a chapbook by Keith Taylor, Ecstatic Destinations (Alice Greene & Co., 2018), with cover art and illustrations by Mary Shea. The title phrase ends up in the last words of the last poem, foretold by the epigraph (spoken by a bus driver!). The book is dedicated to his neighbors, and the poems recount his daily journeys through his own neighborhood, a triangle of three streets.As I know Keith Taylor is fond of birds, I hoped to do a little bird watching in these pages. I found vultures (more than once), chickadees, jays, starlings, and even skateboarders on gossamer wings! Other wildlife included white-tailed deer and a monarch butterfly. Trees: spruce, maple, hickory, redbud, mulberry, box elder, wild cherry, ash, elm (dying), sumac. And grapevines.Alongside the nature, townspeople, town things. And paintings. Here's a poem that gives you the sweetness and summarizes the adventure:     To the Muse     On my daily walk     around this triangle     of crowded streets     occasionally someone     passes by carrying     grocery bags filled     with peaches and milk.Makes me want peaches cut up in milk. And I am glad to say a goldfinch came to own my back yard today, to feast on the seedhead of a purple coneflower."},
{"title": "Falling Off the Empire State Building", "date": "Tuesday, August 11, 2020", "text": "Today's #SealeyChallenge book is Falling Off the Empire State Building, by Jimmy Pappas, the 2020 Rattle Chapbook Prize Winner. Pappas's book grabbed me today for its somehow darkly comic yet patriotic title, the day Biden has announced his running mate, Kamala Harris. The title captures how I've been feeling lately, with America having reached great heights only to fall off its own pedestal. Yet here I can celebrate something.And I am certainly enjoying reading a poetry book or chapbook a day on the advice of poet Nicole Sealey, a good literary citizen. I wanted to tell you yesterday about that moment in the \"Document/ed\" chapter of Brian Sonia-Wallace's book, The Poetry of Strangers, but I am telling you today: \"A mentor had been talking to me about 'literary citizenship' as the obligation that writers have to support each other's work and work to elevate each other's voices.\" Brian was thinking about it in the context of citizenship itself, \"in an age of immigration terror and child detention.\" Paying attention to poetry was something he could do. And it's something I can do, as a poet and a reader of poetry.So let's visit the Empire State Building together! Pappas's book starts with an \"Invitation\" to homemade organic pancakes sprinkled with blackberries picked in the rain. I'm in! The second poem, \"Creation,\" creates the [poet's] world and the theme of falling via \"the man across the street / who fell off a ladder / to the cement sidewalk.\" (This reminded me of the guy who fell off our roof and broke both wrists, repairing our home after a house fire, a fact we learned much later from the neighbors, as we were living elsewhere during the repair. I hope compassion after the fact still counts!) Here are Jimmy Pappas's \"four Noble Truths:\"     Life is suffering. People fall     off ladders. Love ends.     Nothing has any meaning.The title poem is a father poem, and also repeats an urban legend. There are unsentimental and deeply human tributes to stepmother and mother, noting \"the massive indifference of the universe\" and a plethora of shoes. A father poem of love and guilt, deathbed poems of pure love for various people, a lovely poem where his sister, ready to die, signs, \"Sleep.\"     She took the open palm of her right hand     and dragged it down her face. Sleep. Sleep. I, too, would have let her sleep. And then, in \"Mourning,\" taking the poet Sappho's advice, Jimmy Pappas keeps     jotting down     notes     for my next     poem.A poet's gotta do what a poet's gotta do. And that takes me back to The Poetry of Strangers again, something Brian Sonia-Wallace says in one of his own unsentimental poems, how he's     always rooting for the monsters       who are at least honest         to themselves, at least     not pretending altruism.Jimmy Pappas, who has a poem about putting his screaming father in a nursing home against his will, might agree. And \"rooting for the monsters\" takes me all the way back to My Favorite Thing is Monsters, by Emil Ferris, and now you've come along with me on a Random Coinciday in the blog."},
{"title": "The Poetry of Strangers + Delicate Thefts", "date": "Monday, August 10, 2020", "text": "Brian Sonia-Wallace was a writer-in-residence for Amtrak and the Mall of America and has his own small business called RENT Poet, and, you guessed it, he writes poetry for strangers on a typewriter! His book, The Poetry of Strangers: What I Learned Traveling America With a Typewriter (Harper Perennial, 2020) was, I have to say it, a great ride. It's got lots of poems in it, including translations, so I was going to count it toward the #SealeyChallenge, but I also read another Debra Kaufman book, Delicate Thefts (Jacar Press, 2015), and there are tiny stolen things in both books, both concrete and abstract.Like me, Brian is an actor, too. Unlike me, he approaches his poetry writing, as well as his reading aloud, as performance. Like me, he connects poetry with attention and listening.* He actually composes poems after listening to his customers' stories, writing the poems they need. Vending his poems across the country, he has worked with all kinds of interesting performers, including clowns and witches, and has appeared at big corporate events, malls, music festival, and, interestingly, a detention center to document (in poems) the undocumented.*Debra Kaufman dedicates Delicate Thefts \"to listeners everywhere.\" I sense she's done her share of the kind of listening that results in poems, too. In \"The Receiver\" she's listening at a bar: \"When I...look straight / into a stranger's eyes, / always he will tell me his story.\"Brian Sonia-Wallace experiences that intimacy, too, in talking to strangers. They will tell the deepest things. Back to Kaufman's poem: \"Two drinks in I have taken / the gift of his loneliness.\" Here, the loneliness was a gift, not a theft, but the stolen things in Kaufman's book include a locket, a wallet, stolen innocence, pride, self-image. All, yes, with a delicate touch.Stolen lives. In \"At Duke Gardens, After Another School Shooting,\" there is nothing to do but seek solace, remembrance, and \"peonies you can wash your face in.\" In \"Trying to Find a Way,\" sometimes the heart is too full, with \"no room for another's story.\" And sometimes it's \"A Perfect Day to Hang Out Laundry\" and let a memory waft in as a comfort:     His first day at kindergarten     Danny said, My shirt smells like wind."},
{"title": "The Next Moment", "date": "Sunday, August 9, 2020", "text": "As with so many books of poetry, here's a beautiful cover that draws me in, with cover art by poet and publisher Richard Krawiec, and cover design by Daniel Krawiec. The book, on Day 9 of the Sealey Challenge (where I should be saying #sealeychallenge except I am hashtag challenged), is The Next Moment, by Debra Kaufman (Jacar Press, 2010). Lots of beauty and empathy in this book, speaking directly to me in poems like \"The Drought Speaks,\" naming flowers I love, dry spells I've known, and things I now know to be true:     ...it's the wildflowers that prevail,     their ragged foliage     still green in the heat,     new blossoms about to open.As I read this one, on a cool morning after enough recent rain that my husband is mowing, our devil's strip is wildly blooming with Queen Anne's Lace. I've got some in blue water on the kitchen table because my friend Kristi said she did this as a child to watch the white blossoms turn the color of the water. They did, after a week or so. Blue lace!I love this first couplet of the poem \"Cul de Sac,\"     Everyone still wants to live in a cul de sac,     says tonight's hostess, a dancer turned realtor...the beautiful, cautionary claustrophobia of it. Plus, I've got a dancer turned realtor in the family, my nephew!How about this, from \"After\"?: \"The road to hell, / she'd said, is curvy.\" Funny, wonderful, all too true. Is \"falderal\" a word? I've written in my notebook. Yes, a variant of \"folderol.\" [\"Dated: a showy but useless item\"] As in \"her nightgown, / silken falderal, / dances on the line.\" Gorgeous!Kaufman's poem \"The Rushing Way I Went,\" which ends the first section, Too Late, reminds me of Emily in Our Town, coming back to her life after her early death on one special day that goes by too quickly. Debra Kaufman is also a playwright!Part 2, We're Never Ready, starts with a diagnosis, dire. A middle stanza resonates with Midwestern me:     The river murmurs, we have questions.     Corn stands upright in its close rows.     The wind stops repeating itself.\"Cemetery Drive\" is just so darned beautiful, ending, \"Clouds the color of bruised peaches drift east. / So much sky it hurts my heart.\"\"Last Words\" is a gorgeously brutal poem of famous and not-so-famous last words and undying love. \"We're Never Ready,\" as you might guess, is a funeral poem, on the facing page of \"Receiving Line,\" about handshakes, something we're not doing now, or shouldn't be.In \"Forty Days After His Death,\" I found another reference to pecans--\"pecans pummel the roof\"--which like the Tayari Jones sentence from The Untelling makes me long for the geography of pecans. In \"March Blackbirds,\" mostly about starlings, I also found a reference to the \"brown-headed cowbirds\" I've heard and seen in my own back yard. I love the closing lines:     Daylight savings has sprung too soon,    she says to Jesus or no one.Oh, the joy in the middle of \"Summer Solstice\" (with its accidental Covid moments of solitude and vulnerability):     To crave solitude like a new lover     you can never get enough of---     is this good?     Love can die and even if born again     is weakened by the wounding     and resurrection.     But sometimes--surprise!--     joy flies in like a jay.And in \"Autumnal Equinox, on the facing page, as a \"boy leaps into leaves,\" a joy coming all too soon. I'm glad to find in Debra Kaufman a shared love of Rumi and, in the last poem, Leonard Cohen. Hallelujah!"},
{"title": "Patricia Dobler: Collected Poems", "date": "Saturday, August 8, 2020", "text": "Today I sat outside in the beautiful breeze on a mostly sunny, partly cloudy day and read Patricia Dobler's Collected Poems (Autumn House Press, 2005). It's sort of a three-in-one, as it collects her last set of poems, Now, finished, it seems, just before she died, and two earlier books: Talking To Strangers, Winner of the Brittingham Prize in Poetry (University of Wisconsin Press, 1986), and UXB (Mill Hunk Press, 1991). I'm lucky to have it, as I see it's currently out of stock and out of print at Autumn House, but it was sent to me this year by administrators of the Patricia Dobler Award. I was this year's winner--a great honor--though the part of the prize that was a trip to Pittsburgh for a reading, scheduled for April 3, 2020, was, of course, cancelled. And that's not the only coincidence here. Far from it!First, it contains many mother poems! (My winning poem was a mother poem.) And these connect with the mother/grief poems mentioned yesterday as well as earlier in the blog, as I read a poetry book or chapbook a day for the Sealey Challenge in August. Here are some lovely lines about her mother in \"On the Way to a Meeting\":     If she had known what I was doing*     she would have been happy for me,     my mother, her one talent was loving.     Mine is grieving.*...drinking wine in Naples. My own mother is quite alive, has the talent of loving, and many more, and also approves of wine drinking. Sadly, Dobler's mother \"was dying while I was moon gazing, / the wolf moon was already eating her.\" Other beautiful poems, such as \"Persephone's Blues,\" mourn the mother and bring her to life or bravely accept her death. I particularly love this detail from \"Body Secret\":     In the morning I went to her bed and found     the still body, the little foot stuck out of the sheet.So tender, so real.Though Dobler has been gone since 2005, her poems feel relevant, even prescient. Her \"Rich and Poor\" sees the great economic divide clearly, the gated communities, and predicts the walled mansions to which the rich might retreat from global warming and social unrest.     As the rich become supremely rich     they disappear     invisible in their silences     they could be doing anything     behind their great walls.There's the coincidence of a monument controversy in \"Upended Monument,\" which, all too perfectly, shows us the bronze monument, half buried, of \"a horse's ass.\"In an eerie, sectioned, dream poem, Dobler recreates her own birth: \"Meanwhile, my mother struggles to birth me through the early morning hours, I twist, my wee collarbone splinters...\" Scary! And on the facing page, still in the same poem, the delightful line \"what would Nancy Drew do.\" In a darkly funny parody, \"The Penelope Interview,\" Penelope, wife of Odysseus, famous in Greek myth for weaving a tapestry she unravels at night to fool and fend off suitors, is a fiber artist with a new show up, \"Seduced by Color,\" at the Ithaca Center for the Arts. Another favorite is \"Your Idioglossia,\" about a private language shared between two sisters. No wonder one of them grew up to be a poet (the creator of the private language) in this bittersweet story of speech therapy and the loss of the \"idioglossia,\" twisting in the water with orange carp.But I was struck by the random coincidii of personal connections here. Dobler is half Hungarian and her immigrant grandparents settled in Ohio. That's true of part of my family, too. She ended up in Pittsburgh, where my dad was born. In \"False Teeth\" her mother (or grandmother) has lost all her teeth at age 30, just as my grandmother had lost hers at age 16. Something about the soil/water in Ohio... And then the astonishing coincidence of the poem \"Forget Your Life\" dedicated to a woman poet who would die too soon, right before her first (and therefore only) book of poems was published. That poet is Michele Murray (1933-1974), about whom I wrote my master's thesis at DePaul University, after meeting her son when we both worked at the City New Bureau of Chicago! When I found that poem, that connection, I gasped, and was all the more grateful and glad of the Patricia Dobler Award! (And Patricia Dobler had also lived in Chicago for a time.) The coincidences continued--to translations, as UXB contains Dobler's translations of poems by Ilse Aichinger, the UXB being \"an unexploded bomb / asleep in the old airfield more than 40 years\" outside the window where \"you and I were slugging it out / at the table\" (the process of translation),...\" a link to you / that I could understand.\" You can bet I felt a link to Dobler with Murray that was as powerful as the link to Aichinger that Dobler felt here. And I connect with the love expressed in Dobler's poem \"World Without End.\" These words, nestled in the middle of the poem, I copied down as a weird array of sirens (a car alarm?) erupted in the neighborhood:     ...When sirens warn, I want     everyone I love gathered with me on a high mountain     where we start over, all of us saved by a miracle     because we are mild, intelligent and happy in our work.Hmm, I guess I'm like the \"supremely rich\" here, wanting to hide away and be magically saved, though by mildness, intelligence, and happiness in work, not riches. And the last poem, \"Whenever Someone I Love Gets Sick I Get Angry,\" all too perfectly fits our Covid times:     ...So when I am angry with your fevers,     when I say \"don't die\" so fiercely, I want you to hear     \"I love you,\" the full weight of those words."},
{"title": "Get Up Said the World", "date": "Friday, August 7, 2020", "text": "Today I read Get Up Said the World by Gail Goepfert (Cervena Barva Press, 2020). Isn't the cover excellent? So is the structure, each poem preceded by the dictionary definition of a relevant word.* The very first poem, \"Speaking Up for Silent Eggs,\" gave me one of those Covid reading moments of pause:     Masks applied,     peeled off each night.These are metaphorical masks, as the poem takes place before Covid, when people are \"standing elbow to elbow\" at a wedding. That did not console me, though, as my mind turned to worry: my daughter's partner needs to attend his sister's wedding in early September, and it won't be safe to stand elbow to elbow at a wedding then, nor to fly, and he'll be returning to her. \"How do we persist in this living?\" asks Gail Goepfert, innocent of my particular worries, but experienced in the world's yearnings: \"I want together to be less lonely than alone--- / together, a small surrender.\"*Example: You will (and you won't) want to experience the \"deluge, noun... a large amount of thing that come at the same time; an overwhelming amount or number\" of worries, burdens, and knowledge that comes in \"Cold Calling,\" an account of a telephone call.The random coincidii here include \"While Spooning Jelly on Toast\" (a poem that goes with \"mettle, noun...vigor and strength of spirit or temperament\") about a mother and daughter shopping for a bra, post-surgery--connecting to Yvonne Zipter's beautiful poem \"Grace Lesson,\" written about here--and Erin Coughlin Hollowell's poems of mother grief in Every Atom. I loved finding the title poem and its facing-page definition (\"revivify...to give new life to\") as well as its epigraph connecting it to a poem by Louise Gluck, a favorite poet of mine. And I loved how Goepfert's \"Ars Poetica\" relates to H is for Hawk, by Helen Macdonald, a book I loved.She also provides the perfect final word--\"plenitude\"--and final poem, \"Drinking It In.\" I look back at the delightful cover, its empty green bottle, propped against a window or door frame, telling me to \"Get Up.\" \"I drink from the lip of the bottle. Quenched.\""},

East of Eden is the book division of Poetry East, and these translations were published in various issues of Poetry East, of which Richard Jones is the editor. I was once his associate editor, as a graduate student at DePaul University. I remember how much he has always loved poetry in translation and ancient poets of simplicity and wisdom, and I found plenty of that here! With various partners, he has translated the work of Rilke, Basho, Petrarch, Apollinaire, Hitomaro, Issa, Machado, Neruda, and several others, nestled in beautiful art.Of course, I read the first poem, \"Lament,\" by Rainer Maria Rilke, aware of the connection to yesterday's lamentations and my tendency toward Covid reading, alas:     Oh how everything seems far away     and long past.Yes, it does, but poetry makes it eternal. Rilke is paired with pictures of Rodin sculptures from the Rodin Museum in Paris. Rilke worked as Rodin's personal secretary!(Another random coincidence here is \"Archaic Torso of Apollo,\" the Rilke poem that ends, \"You must change your life,\" as quoted in my Blogger profile.) And I have discovered, thanks to this book, that \"I love the obscure hours of my existence / in which my intellect is absorbed in deep thought.\"Here's a Basho haiku that made me laugh:     I forgot my hat     And now the cold rain's falling.     Okay. Whatever.And here's one that made me mourn:     Leaning on her cane,     My white-haired sister still weeps     Beside her son's grave.Here is the childlike joy of Isso:     Snail, you're my hero.     You will give all of your life     to climb Mount Fuji.And here's wisdom in simplicity from Ryokan:     Falling cherry blossoms.     The remaining cherry blossoms also become     falling cherry blossoms.And here's a short poem from Antonio Machado's Proverbs and Songs, that \"gives the lie,\" as they say, to fake news:     Your truth? No, the Truth---     Come with me to look for it.     Your truth's not even worth keeping.And that makes it a Thor's Day (if I had a hammer...) as well as a Poetry Someday and, as it is so often, a Random Coinciday in the blog."},

To quote Hollowell, \"It's not tidy, memory.\" Maybe I couldn't bear it. There is so much grief, including anticipatory grief, it breaks my heart. Grief for a mother, grief for a brother. What have I to do with lamentation? asks one of the poem titles. Oh, everything.Look at these first four lines from the first poem, titled All goes onward and outward, nothing collapses:     My mother asks me to call my father.     Tell him to come and get me. My father     is sitting next to her on the sofa as she says this.     He is the one who handed her the phone.See what I mean? Could you bear it? Yes, we can, and we have to bear it. Erin Coughlin Hollowell makes it beautiful and bearable. Her poems are emotional and philosophical at once, full of ingenious forms and layouts, full of gorgeous images:     It's not tidy, memory.     A house built straddling a chasm.     The way drifting smoke disappears     against the scraped palette of sky.And look at this very precise image from a poem called The last scud of day:     I brush away the hours     like the smeary skids of eraser     left over from a project that went     from unwell to undone.Alas, \"undone\" like my intended review! The poem continues:                                            Words     scrawled over the ghosts of others     and then rubbed away again.Can't you just see and feel those \"skids of eraser\" from childhood writing and drawing? Can you remember those ghosts of other words?Random coincidii on a Wednesday, the hump of the week:1) As I read the following lines from a prose poem called Hankering, gross, mystical, nude, I was sitting on a blanket on my glider, gray clouds swarming above me: \"Maybe it's better to put a sweater on, better to gather blankets and tea. Hold our lovers close while we can still remember their names.\" I put a sweater on.2) Resonating with A Slow Bottle of Wine by Katharyn Howd Machan: a difficult mother-daughter relationship.3) Resonating with American Zero by Stella Wong: pineapple. Oh, when Hollowell feeds her mother a pineapple chunk \"and she says / good\" I smiled, just like the speaker of the poem."},
{"title": "A Slow Bottle of Wine", "date": "Tuesday, August 4, 2020", "text": "Today I read the poetry chapbook A Slow Bottle of Wine, by Katharyn Howd Machan, winner of the Jessie Bryce Niles Chapbook Award 2019. A fine book with a gorgeous cover that involves a self-portrait by the author's daughter, CoraRose Howd Machan, also an important figure in the poems. This is a book of 40 poems about a sad love affair that produced a beautiful daughter--see her here!--troubled by heroin addiction. Her mother is tortured by this, too, as you can imagine. The poem \"How To Lose Your Perfect Child\" is devastating. It's a set of instructions for how to live in denial while neglecting your child on a beach. It contains the guilt and the grief of a loving mother who knows and doesn't know what she did wrong, and almost accepts that there's nothing she can do it about it. Day Four of the Sealey Challenge breaks my heart on another beautiful day in paradise.Random coincidii:1) Today I drank a slow (half) bottle of wine, temporarily masked, and appropriately socially distanced, on my patio with my friend, Kim. This was a bottle of Firefly red wine, not the Pomelo announced/updated yesterday/this morning.2) I was struck by these lines in A Slow Bottle of Wine in the poem \"Tonight\":     I was sixteen when a man first trod     that impossible place of sky and stars...so soon after reading, in Bruise Songs, by Steve Davenport, in the poem \"Dear Happy Ending\":     When I was fifteen,     astronauts stepped     down onto the moon,     dividing it forever     with a flag     and some God.I was a little younger when this happened but remember the moment, going outside, away from the TV, to stare up at the moon while a man was standing on it.3) Halloween poems. Who gnu that two days in a row I'd read poetry chapbooks with Halloween poems in them? American Zero yesterday, and A Slow Bottle of Wine today. With a moment of inescapable Covid reading when I encountered the line \"we search for weeks for just the right mask.\" Sigh..."},

Isn't this a great cover? The cover photo is by Elaine Dong, and the cover design by Kelli Russell Agodon, poet and publisher. I love this little book. It doesn't take long to read (I'm still drinking that Raspberry Lemonade Gatorade G2) as it's only 10 poems long, but each one is a zinger--powerful, full of word play, and teaching me new things, even in the re-reading because I always need to re-learn things. Sigh...The random coincidence today is the color yellow. The lilies, the pineapple of the first poem, gold medals, golden skin, a \"yellow skin- / tight suit\" (perfect line break), a pomelo, Katy Perry's \"yellowface / and Hello Kitty obsession,\" beer, pee, and Halloween pumpkins. Also, speaking of Halloween, today feels like fall.I love these poems. I love the last poem, \"While I'm Not a Heroic Couplet,\" how it contains the book's title, and how it begins:     America, I am not a negative     nor a positive. I am your zero     sum game...And I love the poem \"Everything About You is Offensive Except Your Cat\" (the one with the Katy Perry incident in it) for its wonderful title and how it ends:          What is more     sacred than     a thousand arms     born gold     like me,     dancing on     one hand,     playing     myself with     all the rest.UPDATE: The next morning, during senior shopping hour at Jewel, I got wine!

Today I offer it for Day Two of the Sealey Challenge to read a poetry book a day. I had started to read around in this book when it first came, but today I read it straight through. Well, I read the first poem, \"Dear Horse I Rode In On,\" and then the note about it in the back, which I knew was there from my reading around, and the note mentioned the last poem, \"Soundtrack for Last Words,\" so I read that, and then the actual last poem, \"Moon Aubade,\" and then I went back to the beginning. That's my nonlinear way of being linear.Speaking of the moon, my husband just came in and said to go out and look at it. So I did. It's full on this beautiful clear night. And, hey, I started this book in the morning and finished it at night, so I am linear, after all.I'm thanked at the back of this book! I think it is for encouraging Steve to write poetry and for reviewing two of this other books, Uncontainable Noise for RHINO, and Overpass for Prick of the Spindle, back when I was the Poetry Cheerleader. Gosh, I loved being the Poetry Cheerleader.Speaking of sports, I know Steve from volleyball. Our daughters played (in separate towns and school systems, so sometimes against each other), and my husband coaches, so I saw his girls through the years. They turn up in this book, too! They are with me now as I quote these words from \"Love's the Boy\" (p. 61):Thank you for the languageyou gave back, my daughters,their names. Love's the boywhiskied, stuttering, tossed.And love's the boy returnedlike dice, finite.He lost the names of his daughters and his wife during a stroke, and those stroke poems hit hard. There's whiskey and music, too. And monsters: \"'Mack the Knife,' a monster improved by song.\" Of course, this connected in my mind to my recent reading of the graphic novel, My Favorite Thing is Monsters, by Emil Ferris, which muses on good and bad monsters, how life can make monsters of us, how we can live with our own monstrousness, and sometimes transform ourselves again, becoming hugely human, lovingly human. Yes, \"love's the boy returned.\""},

I will be re-reading some books, joining some in progress, and reviewing some for Escape Into Life, as in today's pick: Kissing the Long Face of the Greyhound, by Yvonne Zipter, just out from Terrapin Books. Here's my review at EIL. And here's my stack of books, which may 1) change 2) fall over.See that black shelf unit my stack is temporarily sitting on? That arrived today, used, rescued from a house my husband is fixing up. Today I had planned to go out and hang doorhangers for a local candidate, a no contact distribution of campaign literature; I don't knock or ring the doorbell, and the doorhangers have an ingenious slit in them which means I can slide them onto almost any doorknob without actually touching it! But it clouded up just as I was about to head out, and my phone told me it was going to rain. So I stayed in. And did the thing I had been avoiding: cleaned up my office! So, once again, even though it is Slattern Day in the blog, I was accidentally not a slattern."},
{"title": "Monsters", "date": "Friday, July 31, 2020", "text": "I loved this graphic novel by Emil Ferris: My Favorite Thing is Monsters! It's set in 1960s Chicago and, via memory/tape, World War II. Since I lived in Chicago for 20 years as a grownup and was alive in the 1960s as a kid, I recognized a lot of places and major events, including the terrible and heartbreaking assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. and Chicago's devastating response to it.The story is \"told\" by a young girl, Karen, who is drawing it as she goes. She's got a tough, interesting life, that's for sure, full of mystery and, yes, monsters. The girl and author see something wonderful in some monsters. \"The bad monsters want the world to look the way they want it to. They need people to be afraid... Bad monsters are all about control... They want the whole world to be scared so that bad monsters can call the shots...\" Yep. Good monsters are dealing with what's happened to them in ways that can include kindness, love, smarts, vulnerability, and resourcefulness.It was great to see the Aragon Ballroom, Graceland Cemetery, and paintings from the Art Institute in this book. I think I did a poetry reading once in one of the old buildings. And my path has crossed with the fellow in the story seen as a genius by Karen's brother. The art is fantastic. It recreates the girl's notebook, down to the lines and metal spiral binding.This is book one, and I can't wait for book two, but I'll have to; it's been delayed, as was book one. The first delays had to do with West Nile virus, a change in publishers, and a freight company going bankrupt, leaving 100,000 copies of the book stalled in a ship at the Panama Canal. I think book two is now delayed till the fall of 2021. But so is everything else!Random reading coincidences: References to Greek myths + a character named Sonja in both The Untelling and My Favorite Thing is Monsters, along with the death of MLK, Jr. A cat in a cemetery scene in both Monsters and Empire Falls (another Richard Russo book.) It's like everything I read is fitting together. And today's random coincidence was another cool graphic novel, this one a noir story, also connected to other books, by Jules Feiffer, who I always thought of as a playwright and cartoonist. Now he's doing this, too: Cousin Joseph, a prequel to Kill My Mother (need to read), to be followed by The Ghost Script (still to come)."},
{"title": "Untelling", "date": "Thursday, July 30, 2020", "text": "I loved Silver Sparrow and An American Marriage by Tayari Jones so much that I needed to read her other books, too, and fortunately interlibrary loan is again possible, so I got hold of The Untelling and Leaving Atlanta. The latter, set during the Atlanta child murders in 1979, is heartbreaking. Both books are continuing my anti-racist education, as I am learning about black life from black authors. In Leaving Atlanta, Tasha's father joins a search party for one of the missing children and is partnered with a white man. She overhears her father speaking privately with her mother at the dinner table. \"Sometimes those decent white folks can understand that we can't forgive them.\" Yes. \"Especially not at a time like this.\" We're in another terrible time now, still standing side by side, some of us, searching, and still caught in that terrible unforgiving place.I was surprised to find \"Tayari Jones\" as a character in Leaving Atlanta. But it also made perfect sense, as the author was a child when the child murders were taking place. (Here's a Reader's Guide pdf about that.) I was surprised and delighted to find a character named Octavia, as I'd just been reading a lot of Octavia Butler. Coincidence?! While Octavia is the point-of-view character, she's worried about a missing boy, a friend in her class at school. Girls have giggled about a possible romantic connection there. That and the geography give us this beautiful sentence: \"The sound of wind in the pecan trees was like girls giggling.\" Will I ever be where I can hear the wind in pecan trees?In The Untelling, a young woman learns who she is through empathy, awareness, and suffering, and on the way to that she's not always \"likable,\" a wonderful risk for an author to take, and she's otherwise meant to be a sympathetic character, who has survived a terrible loss. \"I wanted to tell him that I knew how he felt, though I probably did not. How can you know what another person is going through when your own life is so different from his?\" This is so real, so honest. \"People had done this to me often enough, telling me that they knew how I felt because they had suffered this or that loss, felt some sort of pain.\" She's impatient with the gesture of empathy, that possibly surface connection, and decides it's probably best to say nothing: \"...I could predict his response, his words, polite enough, thanking me for my empathy, my generosity of spirit. And I could imagine his thoughts, that no, I couldn't possibly empathize. Our situations were not the same at all.\" She's right, but is it also an excuse for not reaching out to comfort someone?The book explores differences of class and circumstance among black characters, with differences of race in the background. But I understood that differences of race might prevent any attempt of mine to reach out in empathy to a black person, as I recognized in the words above something that had happened to me. I reached out to a black woman as a woman, and was firmly and not so politely rejected. No, being a woman was nothing like being a black woman. I got her message. But then we went through something hard together, bonded, she appreciated my support, and I feel connected to her forever. Yes, we experience life differently, for many reasons, among them the history of race relations in America, but I can accept that now, feeling the human bond with her. I can respect and honor our difference inside this deep human bond, whether she and I can ever express that to each other in words."},

Indeed, a certain phrase in Bridge of Sighs, about families doing \"the best we can do,\" was the bridge to The Best We Could Do, an illustrated memoir by Thi Bui.Thi Bui tells and draws the story of her family coming to America from Vietnam, after the war, via boat and refugee camp, as well as the story of coming to understand her parents better after becoming a parent herself. It's lovely and honest, and made me think. I realize it's part of my ongoing education this summer in equity, diversity, inclusion, and anti-racism.As always I was aware of the random coincidences. In Bridge of Sighs, the town is poisoned by chemicals and dyes from the local tannery, that get poured into Cayoga Stream. In The Best We Could Do, the author's father helps create a small town, building roads and houses, creating a pleasant, self-sufficient environment with a well-stocked pond, until a fabric dyer moves to town, pours her dyes into the pond, and kills all life in it.Both books tell a family saga and explore the love and a reticence born of trauma that can affect relationships for a long time. Both move toward even deeper love and understanding, and leave some things unsaid, uncertain. Both made me think about, miss, and connect with my own family."},
{"title": "Fever Year", "date": "Thursday, July 16, 2020", "text": "Graphic novels are a great way to receive a lot of information. That is certainly the case with Fever Year: The Killer Flu of 1918, by Don Brown. This was intentional \"covid reading,\" so I could gauge age appropriateness of this book for a possible future Browser Pack at the library. One family had requested books on Covid-19 for kids (I don't think there are any yet), but I knew we had this. It's more appropriate for a teen than a youngster, given the amount and darkness of the facts.This book, published in 2019, right before the current pandemic, is dedicated \"to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, an underappreciated American treasure.\"Here are the \"fun facts\" and, of course, not-so-fun facts about the flu pandemic of 1918, which killed more people than combat did in the Great War, known eventually as World War I:Word origin: flu/influenza. Italians thought it came from \"celestial influence\" and called it ex influential colesti, which got reduced to una influenza in common speech.\"Spanish flu\": The 1918 flu pandemic appears to have begun in the United States and got to Europe via \"doughboys\" during the war. There it proliferated and returned, affecting soldiers, the Red Cross nurses who tended them, and many civilians. When it got to Spain, it got the nickname \"the Spanish flu\" because Spain felt free to report on the illness without revealing weaknesses related to military preparedness. Spain did not like being blamed for the pandemic. (We know of the similar misnomer attached to the current virus.) Also inaccurately, people blamed the flu, and everything else, on the Germans.Famous survivors of the 1918 pandemic: Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Walt Disney (who got it at 16 and then went to France as an ambulance driver), President Woodrow Wilson (at a peace conference in 1919), Mahatma Gandhi, Katharine Anne Porter, who wrote Pale Horse, Pale Rider about the flu, which killed her fiance and split her life in two.Animals: No one knows for sure where it started, but it might have been \"a wild aquatic bird,\" whose droppings infected chickens and ducks, then people, or pigs, and then people. In the search for a vaccine, a ferret sneezed on a human and gave him the flu.Wax: The flu virus can survive in a sliver of lung sealed in a block of paraffin. Alas!Waves: The 1918 flu pandemic was not over in 1918. It had resurgences until 1922.Numbers: About a third of the world's population got infected. At least 50 million people died, probably more. The figures are estimates, and, then as now, uncertainty rules.Masks: People fought over masks in the past, as they do now. Schools and theatres were closed. Masks kept the disease in check in some areas, and in some places masks were the law, and people were arrested for not wearing them. Imperfect use of and knowledge about masks, though, meant infection and death rate remained high.False cures: camphor & garlic necklaces, goose grease, salt up the nose, nightcaps (the kind you wear on your head), onions, alcohol and rest and mustard plasters, coal smoke mixed with sulfur or brown sugar, home brewed smelly \"medicine.\" (We may recall similar false cures recently in the news.) So there you have it, including Ebenezer Scrooge in a nightcap (in an illustration by John Leech)."},
{"title": "Back to Butler: Kindred", "date": "Wednesday, July 15, 2020", "text": "After my excursion toMartha’s Vineyard via Richard Russo, I went back to Octavia E. Butler, thistime via Kindred, the graphic noveladaptation by Damian Duffy (words) and John Jennings (illustrations). Kindred is perhaps Butler’s most wellknown work, and it involves time travel from 1976 back to the antebellum era inthe American South. The time travel aspect may keep it in the science fictiongenre, but it doesn’t rely on science nor provide any scientific mechanism orexplanation for the time travel, and Butler considered it a “grim fantasy”instead. It is indeed grim and horrific in terms of its violence—physical andpsychic—since a modern black woman travels back to a time of slavery, suffersin her new home/present, and has to keep figuring out why, and returning orstaying in order to accomplish a particular important thing. You’ll want toread either the graphic novel or the novel itself to find out! For me, Kindred is part of my education thissummer in racism and anti-racism. Butler as author and Dana as main character,who is a writer like Butler, doing work she doesn’t like to support work shedoes like, has to confront her connection to white people through marriage andlineage. In this way the present is wrapped up in the past, depends on thepast, can’t be extricated from the past—and there you have it: systemic racism(now) and the complexity of the human, social, and economic circumstances (then)that led to the Civil War and, alas, continue unresolved today and are emergingin hateful, newly violent ways.Here’s an interview withthe adaptors and here’s a wonderful reader response/comparison ofnovel to graphic novel by Rachel Rae’ on YouTube.  Rachel takes issue with Dana’s haircut and how it’s hard to tell if she’s a manor a woman. Since I had just read WildSeed, with a shape and gender shifting central character, I was ready forthe visual confusion and found it fit our current times, more fluid in genderidentifications, definitions, and associations. Duffy and Jennings note thatDana’s haircut resembles Butler’s haircut, a way of visual representing theautobiographical similarities there. They also added some in-jokes, I think! One Dana's jobs is at Doro's Cantina, another at Clay's Chips. Doro and Clay are characters in the linked novels of Seed to Harvest. Interesting that Kindred, the graphic novel,  cameout in 2017 and has gotten even more pertinent than ever. I hope it sendsreaders back to Kindred, theoriginal, by Octavia E. Butler.And it definitely prepares me for Antebellum, a horror film starring Janelle Monae, due out in Augustbut Covid-postponed (?), with some basic plot similarities to Kindred. IMDB asks but doesn’t yetanswer the question of whether the film is partly based on the novel. The main characteris an author, like Dana, but her name is Veronica. The trailer shows me thatthe little boy from the past is now a little girl. Veronica’s husband is black,not white. But, indeed, sudden time travel places a black woman of now into aplantation of the past. Hmm."},
{"title": "Old Lady Sweaters", "date": "Thursday, July 9, 2020", "text": "Up until recently, I had two old lady sweaters, both aqua, the color of pools in Florida, after the old ladies have moved there. Indeed, both had belonged to old ladies in Florida, ladies I loved. One belonged to my Grandma Sid, and I kept it as a souvenir of her life. It had big buttons (just a few), clean lines, and a large fold-down collar. I wore it till I wore it out, and then I said goodbye. The other one belonged to my mother-in-law, and I took this one to work to wear in the air conditioning. It's still there--I wore it today!--but the top button popped off, a yarn-covered button, and it sits in the bottom of my tote bag that reads, \"I Like Big Books and I Cannot Lie\" until that possible Someday when I sew it back on. But first, I need to mend a ribbon (again) on one of my fabric masks.I like big books, and I cannot lie. So I have to confess that this image is not my actual book bag, but a similar one. (And the colors remind me of Dunkin' Donuts.) I couldn't find an image of my actual book bag, which came from a library convention exhibits hall. And I have to tell you that as soon as I dedicated my summer to black authors, I realized I had been neglecting Richard Russo, an old white man. I've loved him since Straight Man (hilarious) and Nobody's Fool, and he's written lots of books since then that I failed to read. So now I am reading Chances Are... which is about old white men, but also when they were young. \"Three goddamn old men,\" as it says on page 30.It's also \"an astute portrait of a thirty-year marriage, in all its promise and pain,\" according to a blurb on the book jacket. That, and my recent neglect of old white men in general, made me pick it up, soon after reading An American Marriage, a wonderful book by Tayari Jones. Everybody said it was wonderful, it was checked out all the time when it was new to the library, and we had two copies available, right after I finished Silver Sparrow, another wonderful book, about sisters, by Tayari Jones, so I snatched up and loved it all the way through.So I am still reading black authors this summer, but, for a moment, this old white lady is reading an old white man. In the back yard on another hot day. As soon as I step away from this computer, in this cool lower-level home office, not wearing an old lady sweater.UPDATE (weather and otherwise), next morning: truly cool now after a truly loud thunderstorm last night! Chances Are... is definitely not about \"a thirty-year marriage, in all its promise and pain.\" Turns out that blurb is about That Old Cape Magic, info obscured by the necessary library item-number label! So, after Martha's Vineyard, I might have to head to Cape Cod."},
{"title": "Seed to Harvest", "date": "Wednesday, July 8, 2020", "text": "It may be a dry July, but it's got drama. Some trees and branches came down around town in a brief rainstorm today, followed by more heat, but things got watered. I love growing plants from seed, especially perennials that will drop more seed and come back next year or the year after that, according to conditions. And I collect seeds, too, to scatter where they might like to grow.For me, this will be a summer of  reading black authors writing what they like to write. I've recently been wrapped up in Seed to Harvest, a collection of four novels by Octavia E. Butler. Wow, what a saga! It's like all of human history, and a bit extraterrestrial history on Earth, imagined side by side with how I previously \"knew\" it, a kind of speculative fiction before we called it that. Octavia E. Butler was known as a science fiction writer, and Wikipedia tells me she was the first scifi writer to win a MacArthur Fellowship!In the novels collected here, Butler's imagined history and future of humanity shows it in all its brutality, as a constant, violent struggle for dominance, sometimes eased by compassion, telepathy, and amazing healing powers. Wild Seed is the origin story, where we meet Doro, basically immortal, as long as he can feed on people and breed them for the world he wants to control. He contends with the shapeshifter Anwanyu, a woman (and sometimes a man) who can heal, who feels deeply for people, and who finds freedom and relief from human conflict by being a dolphin or a bird.The animal morphing reminded me of Merlin teaching the young King Arthur! I loved the special powers of the people in Butler's linked stories. It reminded me of a series of stories by Zenna Henderson about The People, who had special powers they had to hide in order to fit in, and it turns out Octavia Butler like Zenna Henderson, too!The other novels here are Mind of My Mind, Clay's Ark, and Patternmaster, the culmination of the series, but actually written first. It's not just movies that have prequels! And wouldn't you know it, along with the brutal quest for power, there was highly contagious disease. Clay's Ark brings in a virus-like illness from outer space. \"And the disease organism could live on the skin for hours in spite of normal, haphazard handwashing.\" Back in 1984, when this came out, we weren't all watching videos on how to wash our hands, or singing songs while doing it.\"Listen! We're infectious for as much as two weeks before we start to show symptoms...  How many people do you think the average person could infect in two weeks of city life? How many could his victims infect? ...There is no cure, ...and by the time one is found--if one can be found--it will probably be too late.\"So that was pretty pertinent. Butler gripped me, that's for sure. And I was so ready for and grateful for this beautiful sentence when it came: \"They held each other until they could no longer tell which of them was trembling.\" I admired her wisdom and patience as a writer, her willingness to leave uncertain and unfinished what can't be known or resolved, and her ability to write a satisfying ending nonetheless."},

As July came near, sans rain, I recalled that last July I went dry for the month. I had read something about intermittent fasting in general and not drinking alcohol on an alternating month basis, and how some bars and cafes were catering to this trend, creating delicious cocktails without liquor but fancy enough to be pricey enough for the establishments to survive, etc. We were coming up on our annual extended family vacation, where there is a lot of wine drinking, and I thought, \"Why not?\" Somebody needs to stay...I was going to say \"sober\" but what I really meant was \"awake.\"I haven't exactly gone dry when it comes to poetry, but I did stop posting a poem a day on a little chalkboard in June. As the poem states, I was \"out of chalk\" from the start, writing with little stubs I found in the kids' art supply boxes and kept in the lid of a jar.Just the other day, my husband found in the garage a bucket full of colored sidewalk chalk that I'd been looking for in the basement. So there's that for the next public art project that might arise from the ongoing circumstances. And I ordered and received a little box of slim white chalkboard chalk for the next round of daily poems, possibly in September. For now, I'm writing in my various journals, intermittently.As I've been writing here, I've been hearing thunder! And, look, it's raining out my window! ...And now I've come back from stepping outside to smell the rain, the needed rain, the gentle rain. It's falling on my prairie flowers, my single tomato plant, my little pots of hibiscus tea, my gradual attempts at a very local permaculture. I forgot to plant a little packet of California poppy seeds, but I have plans for it. I have more to tell you, but not right now."},

It’s a book aboutdenial, asking, Is it possible to bothknow and not know something at the same time?By chance, while I was reading this, we watched thedocumentary After Truth: Disinformation and the Cost of Fake News, which shows the harm that can be done by sendinguntruths out in the world and also how “fake news” is used as a weapon by thosewho should know better. I finally found out exactly what happened with “pizzagate,”a conspiracy theory weaponized to discredit Hillary Clinton during the 2016presidential campaign season. (She had nothing to do with it, of course.) I nowhave great admiration for the Comet Ping Pong pizza parlor staff and customers,so brave, so generous! And compassion for the gun-carrying fellow who wasmisled by fake news. Once he realized he was acting on false information, hereadily gave himself up to police.We need truth, we need transparency. Back to The Glass Hotel. The plot involves aPonzi scheme, like the one that Bernie Madoff devised and went to jail for. “Peoplebelieve in all kinds of things. Just because it’s a delusion doesn’t mean itcan’t make real money for people. You want to talk about mass delusions, I knowa lot of guys who got rich off of subprime mortgages.” That’s a characterjustifying his own lies, just as Jack Burkman justifies using fake news to try to getwhat he wants in After Truth.I don’t quite believe in parallel lives. I think theyexist in the math and the mind, not in reality. “What is reality?” someone willask, and/or use to confuse or mislead me. What might I answer? Comet Ping Pong."},
{"title": "Last Days", "date": "Friday, June 19, 2020", "text": "My tiny chalkboard poems continue and, apparently, areappreciated by many who read them on social media, as these readers are tellingme. I am glad. In addition to sudden chalkboard revisions as I write, Iexperience ongoing changes in interpretation. I wrote “Last Days” in my backyard, on the patio, gazing in wonder at the beauty of everything around me, andfeeling eternity somehow. Inside me was the scary realization that I/we mightbe living our last days on earth…but, if so, at least they would be remarkablybeautiful. And the world could go on without us.Last DaysYes, it might beone of the last daysso breezy and bright,so beautiful and clear.The first version ended with two sentence fragments and hadthree periods. It felt breezier and brighter, therefore,but lacked eternity. Now it is one long sentence, like life. Eternity remainsonly in the title and at a line break. These may simply be the last days ofsheer beauty before rain (needed!) or terrible heat (coming today). Or…thesemay indeed be my/our last days on earth.I suspect I’m under the influence of Station Eleven, by Emily St. John Mandel, published in 2014 butterribly pertinent to now, as it’s about the world after a flu pandemic hasdrastically reduced population and wiped out civilization as we knew it. No grocery stores now, gasoline has expired, no electricity, no phones, no computers.People are making do in settlements here and there. And there’s a TravelingSymphony for entertainment, because, and this is a quotation from Star Trek: Voyager, “survival is insufficient.” This book was gripping and oddly hopeful! And it led me to hernew one, The Glass Hotel, which Ihave to read in a hurry and return as it’s a “7-Day” new book, but time isaskew at the library (as elsewhere) due to quarantining of books and materialsfor seven days upon their return.I’m also reading Seedto Harvest, a collection of four short novels by Octavia E. Butler. She wasa science fiction writer who died young, and people had been telling me abouther work, so I read Fledgling, hervampire novel, which turned out to be her last. When Seed to Harvest came in to the library, I happened to be the onewho “processed” it for library use, realizing I would now wait and let ourregular patrons read it while it was a “new” book, and I’d get it later. Lateris now!Today is Juneteenth (which cannot be descecrated by apresident who had never heard of it till he made it “famous.” Oh, my God. Seewhy it feels like our last days?) Last year, Juneteenth was the theme of ascript I wrote for an annual event sponsored by the local history museum. Iknew it would be as soon as I learned the date of the event, June 19. You can’thold an event on Juneteenth and not honor it. This year’s event, with its owntheme, is not happening, due to the virus, and is postponed till 2021. Itstitle and theme will still be “Hindsight is 20/20,” which sort of breaks myheart.I’m glad I happen to be reading a black author as well asa white author on June 19. But, you know, I’m not sure I like white peopletelling me what books on racism or anti-racism I should be reading. Yes, I wantto learn, and, yes, I like book recommendations, but I want to learn aboutblack experience by listening to black people, and reading their words. Is thisan example of “white fragility”? I don’t know yet, as I haven’t read White Fragility, which is written by awhite woman. Eventually, probably, I will.For now, I’m reading (and writing) what comes to hand andwhat comes to heart in these precious, ongoing, even sometimes interminable last days, where every day is a RandomCoinciday, and some days are Cranky Doodle Days."},
{"title": "Chalk Revisions", "date": "Sunday, June 14, 2020", "text": "My new routines include posting a poem every morning inJune in three ways: in chalk on a chalkboard beside my front stoop, onInstagram, and on Facebook. What I’ve discovered is that I make chalkrevisions, adapting the poem to how it looks and feels on the green chalkboard,how it fits there. This causes a few changes in line break and word choice.This surprised me but was oddly appropriate to the “now” we are living in,containing constant changes in a kind of suspended time that makes meconstantly attentive to the present moment. So, moments ago, yesterday’shandwritten poem about the lavender-colored clematis blooming in my yard wasadapted into chalk without the word “clematis” in it and with a line that has colorsat both ends.Tiny MeditationI gaze at a palepurple bloom on a whitetrellis made of threadupon a wooden fence.In all its versions, it reminds me a bit of the William Carlos Williams poem with the white chickens. Probably because of brevity, thecolor white, and the word “upon.”Another new routine involves masks. I have two masks,both handmade by volunteers, one provided by my workplace, one requested from afriend before I went back to work. It’s good to have two, so I can wash themafter each day’s use and leave one to hang dry while I wear the other. I havetwo little fabric bags for carrying them, and these I also wash after each use.I can carry my mask in the fabric bag in the car, on my way to the grocery store,or in my hand as I walk to work in a scarf or bandana, tied and arranged to bepulled up quickly if I meet someone on the sidewalk as we cross Sugar Creektogether and can’t step six feet politely aside.No lipstick. It would get on the mask. Lipstick in Zoom sessions,to help you read my lips.We all wear masks at work in the closed library. We washour hands frequently and use hand sanitizer. I feel like a doctor or nurse now,walking into the room and washing my hands first thing. I had my annual wellnessappointment with my doctor, as well as a previously scheduled dentalappointment, following the new protocols. Temperature at the door, a series ofquestions to answer, masks. At the doctor’s office, the nurse gave me aheads-up to keep my mask secure, the doctor is a stickler (yay!), and I madesure my glasses secured my mask above my nose. At the dentist, the hygienistwore her usual mask and face shield but had adapted the cleaning to avoidexcess water spray. The dentist did his usual handwashing but not his usualhandshake! And wore a mask.One of my daily chalkboard poems was about masks. So wasanother, one I chose not to put up, as it seemed too harsh and might upset themail carrier. But you can probably handle it:UnmaskedIf you don’t wear a mask          you reveal who you arein more ways than one.It is a little mean and glib. (And, oddly, it reminds meof a line from one of the Batman movies.) But, really, that’s what’s going onaround here, out there, many people not wearing masks, thinking it’s all over,we’re all OK. Friends and co-workers are experiencing it out in the world andare worried. My parents decided not to go to an outdoor restaurant with friendswhen they saw how crowded it was, how few people were wearing masks, how somewere sitting indoors… I’ve only seen my parents four times since March 13, intheir back yard or their huge great room, six feet apart. A friend from Chicagocame to town, and I visited with him outdoors and at the proper distance, nohugging.Sigh… Yes, constant chalk revisions of our very lives. Chalk circles now on park greens to designate areas to sit in the sun. Pink chalk hearts on the street to show where to stand for the Pride Month Pulse memorial event.But don’t be fooled, the virus hasn’t been erased."},
{"title": "Wearing Orange", "date": "Saturday, June 6, 2020", "text": "What a week. What a hard time for our country and ourworld. I am grateful for the peaceful protests in solidarity happening all over. I am sorrowful about the ongoing grief arising from COVID-19,police brutality, racism, hate crimes, economic inequality, global warming,pollution, and violence. Oh, my god, the list of sorrows goes on and on in mymind.As June came up, I thought I’d write a tiny poem aday on an easel/chalkboard we had in the basement from when the kids wereyoung, keep it out by the front stoop, take a picture each day and post it onInstagram for family and Facebook for friends, and bring a tiny bit of cheer orbeauty or love to people daily, from my own skill set, when I feel helplesssometimes, or on hold, and don’t know what to do to help. But June 1 became aNational Day of Mourning, so I started with that. Tuesday became our BlackoutTuesday, but I had put out my tiny-as-a-postage-stamp poem for the mail carrieralready, so I just kept going.Now I am quietly protesting gun violence in America onWear Orange weekend, June 5-6, an ongoing virtual event. We are decorating ourfront doors with orange; mine is sprinkled with orange construction paperhearts, my chalkboard poems, and some tiny shiny bursting boxes with orangepipe cleaners. Official Wear Orange Day was Friday, June 5. June 5 is alsoBreonna Taylor’s birthday. She was killed by guns in a terrible police mistake.But Wear Orange Day was created by friends of Hadiya Pendleton, dead at 15 bygun violence, back in 2013. My poem for that is hard, quick, and blunt. Youunderstand why. Today I Wear Orangeto honor the dead girlkilled by a gun. Orangelike a hunting vest,meant to say:I’m not prey.Hadiya had just been in the parade for President Obama’s secondinauguration and was dead a week later.I’m wearing my orange Moms Demand Action volunteer shirttoday. Yesterday I wore my coral orange work shirt to plant salmon orangegeraniums in the library planters, a marvelous coincidence. And I got to wear abright yellow safety vest trimmed in bright orange to weed along the street. Myshoelaces are melon orange.I don’t like to jump on any bandwagons, but I do wish tostand in solidarity with all our nonviolent protestors today. At a distance,masked, I attended our local NAACP/Not In My Town rally to see, feel, and bepart of the local support. I came late and left early, not wanting to minglewith any crowds. Couldn’t hear or see the presenters, but felt the solidarity.My peripheral vision made me turn at the right time to see potential danger, ayoung white man wearing a bandana on his forehead riding a motorcycle on FrontStreet. My gut said, Trouble. Later,he drove through the crowd and injured people; he’s been arrested. I listen tomy gut now, having ignored it sometimes in the past. After seeing him, Iscanned the crowd, as well. I was looking at the young white guys, I have toconfess. There’s my current bias and tendency to profile. I apologize for thepast, the present, and the future. I’ll do what I can, which doesn’t seem likemuch, but I do vote and help get out the vote, via a tiny elected office.And my tiny poems will continue, at least through June.If I can remember what day it is. And who I am.UPDATE: I stand corrected! (And that surely reminds me who I am!) When I walked down to a nearby park at noon, to join other Moms in orange, all of us holding up honk-in-support signs, you know who was among the honkers? Yep, young white men! Even a youngish white man in a bandana on a motorcyle! (He was wearing his bandana as a mask.) Supporters were men, women, and humans of all ages, white, black, people of color, a surprising number of them masked while driving. There's a whole array of honking styles, let me tell you. Also waving styles. We saw thumbs up and fists up. We were all wearing masks, so we tried to send smiles with our eyes, thumbs up back, and grateful nods. A beautiful day in the neighborhood."},
{"title": "Weather or Not", "date": "Monday, May 25, 2020", "text": "I have finally discovered Jenny Offill! For all of youwho were reading her all along, isn’t she wonderful?! She writes a kind offragmentary prose—vignettes, quotations, snippets of dialogue, prose poems,flash fictions, mini-scenes—all held together by a narrative flow/arc and anarrator’s consciousness. Gorgeous!I started with Dept.of Speculation, about being a mom in a perfect-yet-shaky marriage insteadof being a “monster artist,” as planned. The point of view is a crucial element ofthe story telling in this one, shifting from first to third to first again, soquietly. At one point the narrator is speculating about the phrase “waywardfog,” a state of mind to watch out for! “The person who has the affair becomesenveloped in it.” A little later, “It is during this period that people burntheir houses down.”On aging (though the narrator is still pretty darn young!): “Butnow it seems possible that the truth about getting older is that there arefewer and fewer things to make fun of until finally there is nothing you aresure you will never be.” Then I read Weather,the perfect climate-change follow-up book to A Children’s Bible, by Lydia Millet, who thanks Jenny Offill in heracknowledgements! And Weather is “forLydia”! (This Lydia?! I think probably yes.) Anyhoo, I easily connected with this one because thenarrator, Lizzie, is a lot like me: she works in a library, has a “twinging knee,” and is terribly upset by the most recent presidential election, whichseems to spell the end of the world.So, yes, it’s a book about disaster psychology andpreparedness—“…the superrich are buying doomsteads in New Zealand”—but it’s climatechange, not pandemic, bringing on the end. With a context of 9/11. Her friendfrom Iran, who left right before the Shah fell, gives her insight on that: “Yourpeople have finally fallen into history, he said. The rest of us are alreadyhere.”The superrich retreating into remote or gated safety is aMillet/Offill parallel. In Weather, the superrich who want to go to Mars get toanswer a survey question: “What will you miss most on Earth?” “I will missswimming the most.”I will miss swimming on Earth! The local pools are closed thissummer, a good choice. Sadly, as I write, this is the Memorial Day weekend of photos postedon the Internet of vacationers crammed together on beaches and in waterparks.Oh, there will be illness and death as a result, and not just among thevacationers. Alas!In Weather, …there’s an expert giving advice about how to survivedisasters, natural and man-made. He says it’s a myth that people panic inemergencies. Eighty percent just freeze. The brain refuses to take in what ishappening. This is called the incredulity response. “Those who live move,” hesays.Lizzie, the narrator, is helping to answer the emails ofSylvia, a climate activist also devastated, of course, by the election and bythe relentless damage that now there is no hope of reversing. She says, in aspeech, “What it means to be a good person, a moral person, is calculateddifferently in times of crisis than in ordinary circumstances.” Oh, my, we arechallenged now, aren’t we, on how to be a good and moral person. I admire somuch of what I see out there, and it helps to counter my despair over themasses in the waterparks. Yes, Mr. Rogers, I’ll keep looking for the helpers.And reading. Jenny Offill’s prose style helps. Each fragmentis like a moment lived fully, then let go. It is, therefore, like a meditation."},
{"title": "Songs with Stars in Them", "date": "Wednesday, May 20, 2020", "text": "Oh, there are so many songs with stars in them, amongthem, “So Many Stars.” They are on my mind, and in my ears, playing on in theotherwise silence, partly because yesterday I was listening to The Weepies sing“Hideaway,” where “even the stars hide away.” So I thought I would offer alittle list! Song title, singer/band, maybe the line with stars in it thatplays in my head, and a YouTube link for it so you can listen for yourselves!“Les Etoiles,” sung by Melody Gardot on My One and Only Thrill and, on the same album, in English, “If the Stars Were Mine” ending with a child’s voice calling, “Mom, Mom!”“If the stars were mine, I’d give them all to you…I’d putthe stars right in a jar and give them all to you.”“So Many Stars,” sung by Jane Monheit on Surrender“How can I tell? How will I know?Out of oh so many stars... so many stars... / The wind... is filled withsongs so many songs / Which one is mine?”“Let’s Never Stop Falling in Love,” sung by China Forbeswith Pink Martini on the album Hang OnLittle Tomato, Live in Portland, Oregon. The video has a wonderful, eerie, sweet black and white opening before the live performance.“I know a falling star can’t fall forever / But let’snever stop falling in love”and from the same album, concert, and singer: “The Gardens of Sampson & Beasley”“Under Orion’s starry sky / I lie in the moonlit garden…”“ThankYou, Stars” sung by Katie Melua on Pieceby Piece“And when you’re out there on your own, / It’s the wayback home….You are the reason we found ours, / So thank you, stars.”“Hideaway,” sung by TheWeepies on Hideaway“Even the stars sometimesfade to gray / Even the stars hide away”Happy listening!My scattershot Covid-19 reading had just led me to anopinion piece in The New Republicabout the rich having run off to escape the virus in complexes far awayfrom cities, and how they’ll stay gated and protected afterwards, when my newly-spawnedebook reading led me to A Children’sBible, by Lydia Millet, where some rich kids from a yacht tell somenot-so-rich kids on a beach about their parents’ complexes off in Oregon andWashington state, where they’ll be safe during the chaos of the end of theworld.There’s no virus (yet) in this novel, but there’s extremeweather, pollution, and general toxicity. The rich kids feel insulated from itall, partly by their wealth, yes, but also by their seize-the-day, devil-may-careattitude: “…the yacht kids didn’t care about skin cancer. If they lived longenough to get a bunch of melanomas, they figured, they’d bust out the champagne.”But the book is not about them. It’s a about a group ofchildren and teens who are sharing a summer vacation house with all their parents.I was reading it when we had days and days of rain, while, in the book, parentsand children are preparing for a major storm, of near Noah’s-Ark-like proportions.Indeed, that parallel is intentional. A sweet boy, Jack, has been given achildren’s version of the bible and, having been raised in a climate ofatheism, is reading those stories for the first time…but making viableconnections to the world he is living in. His sister, the narrator, is Evie, likeEve of the Garden of Eden. Another sweet boy, Shel, who is deaf, handcuffs himselfto a treehouse. I had just read a poem in a Zoom event about a woman who livesin a redwood tree for two years to save it from loggers. In this novel, thechildren try to save the animals, Noah-style, from flooding from the storm. In the aftermath, certain events align readily with myCovid-19 filter: “The parents are getting sick….Fever and chills. Headaches.”Then the parents text the children to say not to come back right now, it mightbe contagious. These teens are disgruntled with the parents, who arealways drunk and who have abandoned the world, ruining it. But here, thenarrator begins to awaken to the possibility of their love: “I marveled: theparents, caught in a selfless gesture. I almost wanted to thank them.”Later she remembers not picking up after herself, leavingsnack bags in the family car. “It hadn’t occurred to me to pick it up. I alwayswaited for my parents to take care of it. Once we had let them do everythingfor us—assumed they would. Then came the day we wouldn’t let them.”It reminds of a song by The Weepies, “Can’t Go Back Now.”       Yesterdaywhen you were young       Everythingyou needed done was done for you       Now you doit on your own       But you findyou’re all alone       What can youdo?But while The Weepies move past their nostalgia forhelplessness, and “Walk on, walk on, walk on / ‘Cause you can’t go back now,”the narrator of A Children’s Bibleresists shared responsibility for slick blame and continues, “Still later wefound out that they hadn’t done everything at all. They’d left out theimportant part. And it was known as: the future.” A Children’s Biblecarries some of the righteous rage of Greta Thunberg. Yes, the children can beangry with their mostly self-absorbed parents. I understand young people’sanger and sorrow about the world they will inherit from previous generationsthat were wrapped up in materialism and themselves, allowing global warming tocontinue, ignoring climate change and activism on behalf of the planet. But notall parents or older people of today ignore climate issues. Many are recyclerswho don’t put poisons on their lawns and do grow native plants, etc. And, inthe current coronavirus crisis, it is sometimes young people who are selfishlyignoring precautions, thinking themselves invincible, as young people often do,and not wearing masks to protect others, congregating in houses, parks,beaches, parking lots, apartments for beer parties, just like they did before,until some of them get sick, and it sinks in.Avoiding responsibility and playing the blame game areunlikely to fix anything or lead to lasting change. But suffering may wellteach Evie what she needs to know to be able to “walk on, walk on, walk on….”And I can easily forgive her her petulance, thanks to her moments of insight: “Why are we always complaining? Weget to be alive.”Here’s the New York Times review of A Children’s Bible.And here’s another review of mine, in Escape Into Life, of Mothershell, byAndrea Potos, also read through a Covid-19 filter. And here's the charming, childlike, official music video for \"Can't Go Back Now\" on YouTube."},

I do sometimes wear earrings for Zoom meetings, and I woresome yesterday when I went back to work for the first time, processing librarymaterials in a closed library. Lots of hand-washing, careful use of three disinfectantwipes (for door and cart handles, surfaces), and judicious mask wearing. Itfelt good to see people—the few who were there, only four in the building atall, I think, plus some construction workers renovating the bathrooms, but Ididn’t actually see them; I did see the smaller music collection, reduced tomake room for a new accessible bathroom. A pang, but 1) what’s done is done 2)many people get their music in other ways now 3) we’ll have an accessiblerestroom on the main floor!It felt good to clear off my desk.Mostly, I’ve been working at home. Learning a lot,shifting to some tasks that are already in my wheelhouse (as a reader, writer,and editor), and wondering if and how my library job might change accordingly.All the articles I’m reading about libraries and workplaces re-opening dosuggest that, since there is no return to the “normal” of before, we mightconsider who can still work from home and how to re-structure workplaces forhealth safety, privacy, and fewer shared work stations. Sigh, more like thecubicles of an earlier era. Not to mention the possible health scanning deviceswe might need to walk through, like metal detectors but taking our temperatures…Science fiction that isn’t fiction. Of course, the greatscience fiction writers have always been writing about real science, oftenpredictive science. I was reminding my folks that zombie movies begin with avirus, a virus that wants to live, and so it is very contagious.On Wednesday (I think?) I was describing the plot of themovie Children of Men to my mom. (Istill need to read the book, by P.D. James, no doubt as an ebook, under thecircumstances. Even though I went back to the library, I am not checking outany physical materials till our policy is in place for that!) Pollution orsomething has reduced human fertility, and yet there may be a baby, there maybe a safe place to raise a baby!! Oddly, this has been a go-to movie for me attimes. Like The Fifth Element, whichI also watched again recently, it shows me decent people acting decentlyalongside those who don’t in a scary, chaotic world with aspects of regularlife and its ironic excesses despite the general dystopia of it all.“What happens?” my mom asked, wanting some hope at theend. I hadn’t wanted to spoil the ending, but she needed the hope, which Icould and couldn’t give her, because of the delicate, watery nature of theending, but I could stress the big boat of rescue coming near.This is a Blue Monday in the blog, even though it's Friday. Some weeks, it feels like Monday all the way to Wednesday, when it starts feeling like the Friday that will never come. There are things I am saying to myself these days, inwords in my head that I’m not writing down—not here, not in my private diary,not in poems. They are ongoing. They come while I am walking or working, theyinterrupt my reading. They are mixed—like life. They have hope and fear anddespair, darkness and light. I don’t know if I will ever write them down."},
{"title": "Mother's Day, Again", "date": "Sunday, May 10, 2020", "text": "I’ve been a little sadall day, this first Mother’s Day of the pandemic. We had a nice multi-generationalfamily Zoom chat, with mother stories and laughter, and a baby at hand (andsometimes cuddled in a box like a cat!). Some of us were inside, and some of uswere out—too chilly and gloomy here in Illinois, but sunny and warm enough forthose in Nebraska and Oregon, California and South Carolina… Why was I so sad? Perhaps the general sorrow and unease hascaught up with me.As perhaps it did with Olive Kitteridge, who has mellowed abit in Olive, Again, thesort-of-a-sequel by Elizabeth Strout. If you didn’t like Olive in Olive Kitteridge, you might like herbetter now: her life is catching up with her, she’s worried she wasn’t a goodmother, and she’s learned even more about love. If, like me, you did love thefirst book, you’ll probably enjoy this return to small-town Maine and linkedshort stories that work together to create a novel.I read it at exactly the right time, though as an ebook and throughpandemic eyes. It’s a cold May here, and character Jack Kennison is out on acold June day, noticing the people. “There were people on the sidewalks, manywere young people with kids or strollers, and they all seemed to be talking toone another. This fact impressed him. How easily they took this for granted, tobe with one another, to be talking!” Indeed, how easily we took that forgranted.The character of Suzanne, whom her lawyer friend considers atrue innocent, says to him, “I think our job—maybe even our duty—is to…bear theburden of the mystery with as much grace as we can.” I think she’s right. Blunt Olive Kitteridge, who has come to visit Cindy Coombsafter seeing her in the grocery store and realizing she’s very sick, says, to helpCindy understand why none of her friends are visiting, “Everyone’s scared todie.” Everyone is, probably, or almost everyone. That fear is producing somevery bad behavior in our country these days, and also some very good behavior.That fear, that suffering, may be developing people’s empathy. There’s somebeautiful, generous stuff going on these days, too.On Zoom today, I told about how wonderful it was to talk tomy mom on the phone when I was young and alone and homesick on my own in thebig city. Sometimes I’d call up and say, “I’m sad, sad, sad,” and she wouldhelp me remember the beauty of world. Today on Zoom, my daughter began to tellhow I helped her learn to breathe…to handle pain…and then she cried, and Icried, and the Zoom went on, and we had our quiet tears and quiet recovery, andhere we are again.Ah, and just now, a birth! Mordecai Ivan Rio. Newly in the world!"},

But Ijust read Redhead by the Side of the Roadand was charmed. It’s pretty short, reads quickly, and keeps you rooting forlove, of whatever kind, to win in the end. People keep being human in AnneTyler novels, flawed, though sometimes trying very hard, even too hard, not tomake mistakes. They want to be worthy of love.I could focus on this book, even during this wackadootime when it’s hard to focus on reading. Main character Micah Mortimer likeshis routines, and that may have anchored me! He’s a misfit brother in a chaoticfamily, one of  Anne Tyler’s endearing routines. He’s an IT guy and a bit of a hermit…so he has his ownbusiness, Tech Hermit. He’s “finicky” compared to his sisters and theirfamilies, but his sisters remember a bunch of personal details about people,past and present. I love how Tyler gets into his tech head in her third personlimited omniscient p.o.v. “Shouldn’t they be periodically clearing out theirmemory caches or something?”It was easy to return to normal life in this book, but Ihad a little moment of COVID-19 reading, when Micah is out very early in themorning to run, before any people are out. In his head again: “Imagine if somecataclysm had hit the city overnight.” The streets are empty. He does indeedbegin to imagine the world like that, how long before he would notice, and hissolitary day: “he had all the time in the world, it was beginning to seem.”This awareness makes him a little lonely. It prepares him for something.I won’t tell you what!"},
{"title": "April Poem-a-Day", "date": "Saturday, April 25, 2020", "text": "Likemany poets in April, National Poetry Month, I’ve been writing a poem a day. Iprovided prompts for an online writing workshop I attend and adapted thoseprompts for the public library, where they are posted weekly on social media,so patrons and poets in the community can write along. I had hoped to offer andto write on a variety of topics, not to be preoccupied with quarantine,lockdown, worry, or disease, but worry often creeps in—to my own poems andthose of my fellow poets.Here’sone, for example, that began as the heart’s response to the sound of the train,just before it was leaving town headed north. I used to ride that train often,back and forth to Chicago, and would tell my husband to listen for the trainhorn and head for the station to pick me up. Then an ordinance was passed,establishing a Quiet Zone in town, and hearing the train now is rare.Overground RailroadLeavingtown, the train moans onceonthe cold air, unwelcome April snow comingdown like rain on silent lawns,intosilent fields. It might be a newcrew,unaware of the ordinance againstthetrain sounding its horn in town.Who’sriding the train now? Is it mostlyempty,one living being for every six ghostlypassengers?By now, the train has passedtheghost house three stories high, a stoponthe Underground Railroad, or rumoredtobe. By now, the train can sound its hornatcrossings if it wants, can moan and groan,canwail and keen, lament to heart’s content.There,in the heart of the poem, I see the train sparsely populated, and I know why.Then the other passengers become ghostly. Then history and rumor arrive, andthen grief. There is a house, just outside town, rumored to have been on theUnderground Railroad. It’s a beautiful and lonely dwelling, a favorite of minewhen I rode the train. When I could, I sat on that window side to see it.This poem turned out to be a \"broken sonnet.\" It has 14 lines and five beats per line, with much variation of meter. It doesn't rhyme, except now and then, internally, externally, or slantwise. But it does wail.Aprilgenerally gives me 30 or more drafts of poems to revise and develop over thenext year.

{"title": "Blithedale Postponement", "date": "Thursday, April 23, 2020", "text": "As I mentioned in the context of my loopy reading, The Blithedale Romance, by NathanielHawthorne was up next, after Little Women(fiction) and American Bloomsbury(nonfiction) and the not-quite coincidence of all that genius in Concord,Massachusetts in the 1800s. (Ralph Waldo Emerson brought a bunch of smartpeople together.) It’s always good to read (or re-read) the right book atthe right time. As I started re-reading The Blithedale Romance in mid-April, shortly after some unwelcomemid-April snow, I encountered an unwelcome mid-April snowstorm in fiction asMiles Coverdale travels to Blithedale to join an idealistic, intentional,back-to-the-land community, based on the actual Brook Farm that Hawthornehimself had visited for a time with high hopes. Then Coverdale gets laid up for twoweeks with a rhinovirus! (common cold) in near isolation, tended by maincharacters Hollingsworth (driven by a single idea) and Zenobia (a beautifulwoman and feminist). “Zenobia” is her writer/public figure name; she has a realname in the fiction and is probably based on feminist Margaret Fuller, who isnamed in the fiction, as if to separate the two, perhaps a courtesy.Here are some more coincidences that surprised me:--One of the entertainments in their little set-apartcommunity is “tableaux vivants,” or dressing up as works of art. You may beaware that the Getty Museum challenge, etc. has inspired a lot of that in ourcurrent shelter-in-place situations.--It shouldn’t have surprised me, as some summaries callHollingsworth a misogynist, but he really is, and Coverdale, the narrator, callshim out on it, saying, “Hollingsworth had boldly uttered what he, and millionsof despots like him, really felt.” Which was, basically, that woman is only ahelpmeet at man’s side and must support him fully in his endeavors, blah, blah,blah. I guess the main surprise was Hawthorne outing “millions of despots.”--Zenobia, complicatedly pissed off by this, retorts, “Letman be but manly and god-like, and woman is only too ready to become to himwhat you say!” Meaning, of course, that man isn’t.--Earlier, Zenobia has said, in the context of supportingwomen’s rights, “Thus far, no woman in the world has ever once spoken out herwhole heart and her whole mind.” It reminded me of Muriel Rukeyser, who said ina poem, “What would happen if one woman told the truth about her life? / Theworld would split open”--Hawthorne sounds like a closet feminist himself,speaking through the character closest to himself in life, Coverdale, defendinga broken-hearted woman:It was nonsense,and a miserable wrong,—the result, like so many others, of masculine egotism,—thatthe success or failure of women’s existence should be made to depend wholly onthe affections, and on one species of affection, while man has such a multitudeof other chances, that this seems but an incident. For its own sake, if it willdo no more, the world should throw open all its avenues to the passport of awoman’s bleeding heart.Now, Coverdale sounds like a pretty feeling guy thereabove, but Arlin Turner in the introduction sees him as rather cold, aloof fromfellow humans, and almost the worst villain of the piece, while I saw him asmore the observer, as a writer necessarily is—Coverdale is a poet. Sigh… But,plot-wise, he had the power, probably, to act, and did not, and that’s whatcounts, alas. Even if you can’t achieve a utopia on earth, you’ve got to act inhuman sympathy where you can. I guess I forgave him for being human, flawed,imperfect, and a poet…And I do think he’s right in opposing Hollingsworth, whocares not a fig for the utopian community, but only for his own one centralidea, pushed relentlessly upon the innocent and unsuspecting, respecting onlyhis will, not theirs. Coverdale thinks we are meant to tend to our own lives asbest we can and “insensibly influence other hearts and other lives to the sameblessed end,” not force our “philanthropy” on others or be subsumed by oneoverarching theory or dream.Looping back, I should mention that the cold snap inBlithedale caused the residents to postpone their May Day celebration untillater, when the weather would be nicer. Likewise, our shelter in place has beenextended, postponing many things, but rightly so, as our governor, listening tothe advice of experts, is thinking of the general good of all, not pressing hispersonal will upon us. (And that makes it a Thor's Day in the blog!)"},

They had been very interested in the (covered!) butter dishon the kitchen counter and the flecks of toothpaste on the bathroom counter.But when they appeared en masse, notrespecting social distancing at all, in the bedroom near my husband’s closetand dresser, he went into action with bug spray. He is usually a very gentleguy, and animals love him. But he does not love ants.One was crawling up my pajama leg after some floorstretches. I have returned to yoga. Our daughter, who is training to be a yogainstructor, practiced a focus class on lower back pain on us via Zoom on Friday,and it got me back to A.M. Yoga forBeginners with Rodney Yee on Saturday and Sunday. I like Rodney Yee,forever young via video, as I am forever a beginner.Also got back to the trail, now that the sun is out andthe temperature is up. People remain friendly and polite as they (for the mostpart) maintain the six feet distance from each other. There are “Mind the Gap”signs up now. I’ve reported on my “loopy reading” of fiction,nonfiction, and children’s fiction. I’ve also been reading poetry—the wonderfulbooks Match, by Christine Marshall(Unicorn Press, 2018), Indigo, byEllen Bass (Copper Canyon, 2020), and Blowout,*by Denise Duhamel (University of Pittsburgh Press, 2013). Next up is Duhamel’s Scald (Pittsburgh, 2017). I got theDuhamel books to read on the plane to Pittsburgh in early April for a readingevent there. I won the 2019 Patricia Dobler Award, and she was the judge, andpart of the prize was the reading! It was, as you can guess, canceled. The new (May/June)issue of Poets & Writers justarrived, with the announcement of this award in it, and it gave me a brief pang,tiny as ant bite in the scheme of things.Zoom is helping me in so many ways—the yoga class, workmeetings, a library open mic this past Thursday, Zoom Church this morning, anda family gathering by Zoom this afternoon, bringing together family members inTennessee, Illinois, Nebraska, Oregon, and California. With a baby!!*I love how “blowout” is a big fight, a big party, and away of styling hair, among other things. In hair, it’s a desired thing; intattooing, not.

{"title": "Loopy Reading", "date": "Saturday, April 18, 2020", "text": "After Little Women,I couldn’t settle on the right book to read next. I started Baltasar and Blimunda by JoséSaramago, picked up at the library book sale, which was charming for a boardingpass left inside by its donor; it is a Portuguese novel, and the boarding passwas from Lisbon, Portugal to Barcelona, Spain, back in the days ofinternational travel. I used it as a bookmark. But the language was detailedand dense, and I couldn’t stick with it, and have set it aside for now.Then I went to my shelf for another American classic, andpulled out The Blithedale Romance, byNathaniel Hawthorne, which I vaguely remembered reading at some point. Theunderlining and margin notes indicated I had read it in some studious mood orcircumstance. I skimmed paragraphs of the introduction and put it back. But, toforeshadow quite obviously, the way Louisa May Alcott does, I was destined totake it up again later!Finally, I looked up at the top shelf of my computerdesk, where I keep a row of books about Emily Dickinson, literary feuds,literary intersections, and the act of reading. And there was American Bloomsbury, by Susan Cheever,also scooped up at a library sale, and not yet read. This would be it, the nextread, and its subtitle will tell you why, and also why I looped back to The Blithedale Romance afterwards. American Bloomsbury is subtitled Louisa May Alcott, Ralph Waldo Emerson,Margaret Fuller, Nathaniel Hawthorne, and Henry David Thoreau: Their Lives,Their Loves, Their Work.It was exactly the right read, in part because of its “loopy”style. The author explains what she’s going to do: “a series of overlappingscenes in which some incidents are repeated, sometimes more than once.” Shewants us to see the same incidents through the eyes of the alternating focalcharacters. “By this method I have tried to honor the characters, their lives,and their intimate connections with each other.” I remember my old self, so I confessthat this method may have driven me a little crazy in the past, but the repetitionswere helpful during this scatterbrained time! It was fun to learn that teen Louisa had sort of asimultaneous crush on Thoreau, a young man, and Emerson, an old man; fun tolearn (again) that Emerson basically paid for everything, that he had helpedgather all this genius in Concord, Massachusetts; fun to revisit the annoyingand endearing traits of Hawthorne, Bronson Alcott, and Thoreau. I understand fictional Marmee better in Little Women, whenshe says she is angry every day of her life, by meeting her actual husband via SusanCheever. Ineffectual dreamer.And Margaret Fuller, charismatic feminist, interested methe most. Apparently, several male writers have fictionalized her, includingHawthorne in The Blithedale Romance,so I will be reading it alert to the “male gaze” but with her interesting lifeseen recently through a “female gaze,” as well.If you are having trouble reading, you might connect tothis piece by Kim Kishbaugh in Escape Into Life. She has discovered YA books! And yesterday, thanks to my library’sebook collection, I finally read TheMiraculous Journey of Edward Tulane, by Kate DiCamillo. Yes, I cried."},
{"title": "Penny Serenade", "date": "Monday, April 13, 2020", "text": "Fair warning: Penny Serenade is a tearjerker. It was on my mind after Baby Boom, because...babies! I had fond (and partly mistaken) memories of Penny Serenade, black and white, first viewed on tv late at night, interrupted by commercials. I loved it then, and I love it now. The hoopla copy had a good soundtrack (volume-wise) and a few vertical slits or seams in some of the frames, giving it a marvelous vintage quality. And now I may be hooked forever on free movies via hoopla via my library card.I had remembered a sweet, sweet moment when a man gives a baby a bath. It takes as long as it takes, as does a new mother's fumbling with getting her baby's clothes off for the bath, and that was a delightful part of the movie, real time scenes. And the baby's sweet, sweet face! But I thought it was Cary Grant giving the bath, and that made no sense. I had conflated the bath scene with a later scene where he gives a great speech with the baby (a year older) sitting in a giant chair. You'll like it.This movie has everything: romance, travel, an earthquake, journalism, comedy, New Year's Eve, and old-fashioned records. In a way, it's the story of a marriage unfolding through memories evoked by songs played on an old-fashioned record player. I don't want to say too much more, so you can have the surprises I had on first viewing. And so you can cry. This time I started crying when the inspector saw the child's room in the apartment upstairs from the newspaper office. And just kept crying, between smiles."},
{"title": "Baby Boom & Paper Man", "date": "Friday, April 10, 2020", "text": "OK, boomers! YesterdayI watched Baby Boom via Hoopla via mylibrary card! Of course, I had first seen it back in 1987, three years before Ihad a baby! It was delightful to re-visit this film, which had come up infamily emails because my sister and her husband now live on many acres thatinclude an apple orchard, and he’s getting ready for the summer and fallFarmers Markets (or cancellation thereof due to virus and options for his products viaMcKelvie Farm at Etsy; the wood items are already there, the apple items willcome later!) The tie-in here is applesauce from Country Baby, a brand createdby Diane Keaton’s character after she heads to Vermont!But first she has to acquire a baby! And I’ll let you discover or rediscoverthat plot element on your own. I just want to say I laughed out loud a lotduring this movie—exactly what I needed—and some of it was from Keaton carryingthe baby sideways. Pretty sure no babieswere harmed in the making of this film! And, as often happens, two babies,twins, played the part of this adorablebaby! You will fall in love with her—I did!—and also possibly Sam Shepard!Butis this happening to you? I view films through the lens of Covid-19 now, andcringe when people touch each other or kiss! Early in the film, there is even ahandshake. Noooooo! I wanted toscream, and I knew Dr. Fauci would agree with me, and then the guy in the film actually shook the virus off his hand!! I know he was reallyshaking the hurt off his hand from her very strong handshake—it’s a feministfilm (ish)—but virus eyes saw it differently.Likewise,in an airport—nooooo, not an airport!—thebaby sticks her finger in her mouth. Nooo!Later, she actually gets sick, with symptoms of fever! If I weren’tfalling in love and laughing so much during this movie, it would have beenunbearable.Thenthis morning, on the recommendation of my cousin, I watched Paper Man, also via Hoopla, via mylibrary card! This is a little gem about a writer, starring Jeff Daniels (so Ihad to watch it on my own as my husband doesn’t like Jeff Daniels), Ryan Reynolds, EmmaStone, and Lisa Kudrow. Good acting, a pinata, and a superhero, Captain Excellent!*I’mso happy I can do this, find nostalgic old favorites and charming newfavorites! And do you know what? These two movies have something in common: ayellow house in the country. Oh, also twins. And they are a little hard to hear. I wonder if thisis a transfer-to-hoopla thing, because all ways of turning up the sound wereemployed. Or just older soundtracks. Or older ears.Twofavorite lines (I leave it to you to figure out which line is in which movie):“Idon’t even know how many grandchildren I have now.”\"Whyorigami? Why now?”Wait,my favorite lines end with the word “now.” And that really makes it a Random Coinciday in the blog.*And so does this: also this morning (I've been getting up very early) I found this fabulous YouTube video created by Emily Lloyd, librarian in Minnesota, to help kids handle wearing masks. She's a superhero! Who you gonna call!? Germbusters!"},
{"title": "Little Wisdoms", "date": "Wednesday, April 8, 2020", "text": "I’vefinished my re-reading of Little Women,by Louisa May Alcott, a Big Book full of Little Wisdoms! By that, I mean pithy, sometimes surprising phrases and paragraphs that resonate now as containing something deeply true about humanbeings and their conventions and institutions—so that even if her time stampsthem as dated, they still stand as true, sometimes as prophetic. Here are someexamples:WhenJo takes Beth to the seashore, hoping to shore up her health but feeling the imminenceof her death: “They did feel it, yet neither spoke of it; for often betweenourselves and those nearest and dearest to us there exists a reserve which itis very hard to overcome.” So true! And yet I hope we are speaking our heartsin the current circumstances, feeling our fragility.Alcottuses the phrase “division of labor” to describe what saves Meg and John’smarriage when she has become consumed with the care of their baby twins,neglecting him and the house. When she accepts his help in childrearing and theoffered household help—dividing and sharing the work—their happy little family thrives.Amy’sgood sense, here speaking to Laurie: “it’s wicked to throw away so many goodgifts because you can’t have the one you want.” Indeed, it is! When she speaksof herself, she explains that she has given up on her own artistic ambition “becausetalent isn’t genius, and no amount of energy can make it so. I want to be greator nothing.” She’s right about that, and we have to look hard at our talents,and find the ones to follow. And Amy isn’t contradicting herself here, as sheis not throwing away all her good gifts; she will choose among them and applythem differently. In one of the “dated” aspects here, she intends to be “anornament to society,” which sounds terribly like being an object, but 1) it waswhat she always wanted, from childhood, to be a rich man’s wife and go about ingood society and 2) the way she and Laurie will do it includes a lot ofgenerosity toward struggling artists and education!Andhere’s a dated-sounding-but-still-apt paragraph on men and women:Amy’s lecture didLaurie good, though, of course, he did not own it till long afterward; menseldom do, for when women are the advisors, the lords of creation don’t takethe advice till they have persuaded themselves that it is just what theyintended to do; then they act upon it, and, if it succeeds, they give the weakervessel half the credit of it; if it fails, they generously give her the whole. Alcott’sirony comes within her feminist, suffragist context, which you can read about here,in a lovely article offered by the Arlington (VA) Public Library this month, helpingto celebrate the 100th anniversary of the 19th Amendment!Alcott’s “weaker vessel” surely echoes what men say, not what women are!Herhumor suffuses her prose. Describing those twins, now small children at afamily gathering with a table laden with goodies, she says: “…didn’t they eachwhisk a captivating tart into their tiny pockets, there to stick and crumbletreacherously, teaching them that both human nature and pastry are frail?” Yes,and these days it’s also a warning against hoarding! Again describing children,this time Jo’s, who thrive in a wild upbringing, Alcott says Professor Bhaer,their father, thinks “that babies could digest anything, from pickled cabbageto buttons, nails, and their own small shoes.” This made me giggle.Otherfun surprises during this re-reading:Bethdrops treats from her window to the children below, just like Emily Dickinson!Alcottprefigured the song “YMCA”! “Demi learned his letters with his grandfather,who invented a new mode of teaching the alphabet by forming the letters withhis arms and legs, thus uniting gymnastics for head and heels.”Iam so glad I read this long book in my cozy moments of downtime on the couch orin the back yard, now that the weather is turning warm. What’ll I read next?"},
{"title": "Topsy-Turvy Jo", "date": "Saturday, April 4, 2020", "text": "Thereare so many lovely covers to the book LittleWomen. Here’s one, though not the copy I am reading, an image of which Icannot find online. Today I learned (or re-learned, if I once knew it) that MayAlcott, Louisa’s little sister, illustrated the first edition. May was the realAmy. Her name was Abigail May Alcott, and, Wikipedia tells me, she was known asAbba or Abby until she chose to be known as May, and that’s how she is listedon this title page of the first edition, with her illustration opposite. So “Amy”is not just an anagram of “May” but echoes the two nicknames!Iloved this article about the real Amy—“What Greta Gerwig Got Right: Rethinking Amy March in Light of May Alcott Nieriker,” by Kelly Blewett in the Los Angeles Review of Books—re-seeingher in light of Greta Gerwig’s movie adaptation as well as a new book by JaneSmiley, The March Sisters: On Life,Death, and Little Women. Both authors recognize May Alcott as a modernwoman and a feminist of her own times.Clearly,a lot of us are re-reading and re-thinking LittleWomen right now. I am turning to it as a kind of “comfort food” during thistime of crisis. Imagine my astonishment at discovering May Alcott’sillustration of Beth greeting her father on his return—wearing his scarf like acoronavirus mask!Andthere are various other surprises, among them the number of nicknames. I hadremembered Topsy-Turvy Jo, and, for Theodore Laurence, the boy next door,Laurie, of course, and Teddy, but I had forgotten Toodles as one of hisnicknames!Asomewhat unnerving surprise was the common use of the word “trump” in a slangsense, with the entirely positive connotation it has from cards, where thetrump beats everything! “Three cheers for dear Father! Brooke was a trump totelegraph right off, and let us know he was better.”Welive in a topsy-turvy world right now, changed forever. When we come throughthis hard time, and I hope we will, let it be for the better. I know we’ve beenmade vulnerable by the current president, a “trump” with entirely negativeconnotations, who  must be voted out, mydears, so let us be strong and kind and do what needs to be done. There! Thatshows the influence of listening to Marmee and spending time with someadmirable “little women.”"},
{"title": "The Pertinence of Little Women", "date": "Wednesday, April 1, 2020", "text": "Asa comfort during this strange and difficult time, I am re-reading Little Women, by Louisa May Alcott,first read in childhood. I recalled the March family hunkered at home duringthe Civil War, their father off serving as a chaplain for thearmy, but little did I know quite how much their situation would resonate now!WhenI picked up my book this morning, opening to where my bookmark had fallen inplace the night before, the little women and their mother had received news ofthe illness of Mr. March. Illness in war is common, and our big flu pandemic of1918 happened in war, and here we are again. So Marmee, as her daughters callher, packs a trunk and heads off to tend him, leaving the little women on theirown, in the care of Hannah the cook, and with the protection of the neighbor,Mr. Laurence, and his grandson, Laurie.Thenext morning, they wake to the completely changed circumstances. “’I feel as ifthere had been an earthquake,’ said Jo…” Indeed! And not only does thedisruption current in our lives feel as devastating as that, but there has just been another earthquake—inIdaho!Andfor those of you who are stress eating (or stress baking), look at thepertinence and needed humor of this! “’I think anxiety is very interesting,’said Amy, eating sugar pensively.” I laughed a little, while maintaining mycompassion for those whose anxiety is hard to manage, and probably not withsugar, and definitely not straight from the shared sugar bowl!Iam reading a hard copy of Little Women,a paperback I got for my son when he became enamored of the movie(with Winona Ryder) one Christmas season. (I don’t think he read it, though, asthe binding was very tight, until, alas, I broke it, but now I am not strainingto read in the gutter, so to speak.) And I was eager to re-read this novelafter seeing the new film version thisChristmas season, directed by Greta Gerwig. But you can easily find e-bookversions at the library, along with LittleMen and Jo’s Boys, so I might trythose as our “shelter in place” continues.Somany wonderful details from the book are coming back so vividly from my firstreading! Others I had forgotten: for instance, that the sisters had girlfriendsin the neighborhood who attended their little plays. And that they went on apicnic with Laurie’s British friends and played croquet. That is, there’s notas much “social distancing” in Little Women as I had remembered. Ah,but I know what’s coming next in the plot: Beth’s visit to a house with illnessin it. Again, the pertinence of LittleWomen."},

I had recently read/re-read The Handmaid’s Tale, in hard copy, borrowed from the library, inpreparation. It was high time I tried checking out an e-book, and now it’s theonly way to check out a book, but I did it with some fumbling and trepidation. Forthe past couple of weeks, there are so many new sign-ins and passwords. I hadto change my Facebook password, due to a recent surge of hacking. While somekinds of phone calls have stopped, I’m now being notified, in the voice ofA.I., of lots of cash prizes I’ve won. The hackers and scammers have already discoverednew opportunities and pounced on newvulnerable prey. That potential for doing harm and being harmed constant in humans is part of the plotof Testaments.Itwas fascinating to re-encounter certain characters from The Handmaid’s Tale and meet the new ones. I appreciated theconnections in structure between the two novels—testimony, academic lecture.And I heard the feminism, in waves, the sad wisdom, and both the awareness andlack of awareness in the young:The Founders and theolder Aunts had edges to them. They’d been moulded in an age before Gilead,they’d had struggles we had been spared, and these struggles had ground off thesoftness that might once have been there. But we hadn’t been forced to undergosuch ordeals. We’d been protected, we hadn’t needed to deal with the harshnessof the world at large. We were the beneficiaries of the sacrifices made by theforbears. We were constantly reminded of this and told to be grateful for the absenceof an unknown quantity. I’m afraid we did not fully appreciate the extent to whichthose of Aunt Lydia’s generation had been hardened in the fire. They had aruthlessness abut them that we lacked.Iappreciated the complexity of some of the characters, the gray areas in thethinking. Like the “grey market” (not black market) for desired commodities.While this novel lays out a parallel history to our own, and an alternate present andpresumed future, it could not have anticipated the current coronavirus crisis. Yetthere is fever, there is fake news. And the ending made me cry."},

And some are dealing with surges of depression and anxiety. My heart goes out to everyone in this. I go through periods of change in my sleep patterns, and, yes, I am in one now. My usual solution when I find myself awake in bed, and sense I am unlikely to go back to sleep, is to accept this and get up and go downstairs to read on the couch, where I fall asleep reading.The new twist is that I may doze while reading on the couch, well before bedtime, and 1) just stay there or 2) go up to bed, find myself awake, and come back. This morning my husband greeted me with a kiss (ack! too close! social distancing! but we know we've already been too close and can't do anything about it now!) and the comment, \"You are becoming one with that couch.\"I arrange myself in various ways to 1) avoid a crick in the neck in the morning 2) have the bookmark fall into the right spot when I fall asleep and the book closes. Today I finished Rebecca Solnit's Recollections of My Nonexistence, which I wrote about yesterday. (Was it yesterday? I know I am not alone these days in losing track of what day it is.) I'm sure I'll share more about it, but this seemed particularly pertinent this morning:So much of the work of writing happens when you are seemingly not working, made by that part of yourself you may not know and do not control, and when the work shows up like that your job is to get out of the way.She describes my own experience of writing, and this also relates in a weird, funny way to my work-at-home situation. Generally, I worked in the morning at my library job and worked in the afternoon at home and on into the evening with my freelance writing and editing. There were clear distinctions in my day. Now it all folds together, alternating with physical tasks. I've structured things so I can keep track of actual hours for my \"job job,\" and yesterday I worked too many hours, so today my \"job is to get out of the way\" for a bit!Solnit was talking about the kind of writing that comes out quickly after a long time percolating:The essay poured out with ease or rather tumbled out seemingly of its own accord. When this happens it means that the thoughts have long been gestating and writing is only a birth of what was already taking form out of sight.OK, she used a birth metaphor, and I used an old-fashioned way of making coffee, but we understand each other, yes? This is a more rambling blog entry, I see. I have probably gotten way too far out of the way.

Recently I got myself paperbackversions of her Hope in the Dark, touplift me, and Men Explain Things To Me,to update myself on all that. I am staying calm, so far, in Recollections of My Nonexistence, despitethe bad behavior of some men over time, in her life, in my life, and in history. Sigh…I’mreading the hard copy, sheltered in place at home, and now I realize my libraryhas an e-version, so go for it! Right now I am enjoying her reflections onreading in general—how it is not so much escape as immersion in other lives anda way to develop empathy. Here is her description of reading as an experience,a kind of transformation:Thereis something astonishing about reading, about that suspension of your own timeand place to travel into others’. It’s a way of disappearing from where you are—notquite entering the author’s mind but engaging with it so that something arisesbetween your mind and hers. You translate words into your own images, faces,places, light and shade and sound and emotion. A world arises in your head thatyou have built at the author’s behest, and when you’re present in that worldyou’re absent from your own.Soif you feel absent from your own (former) life now, you might choose a book tobe present in for a time. Solnit has made me want to read Song of the Lark, by Willa Cather, “in which the ambitious,amorous, extraordinarily talented heroine is not punished” as women are sooften in books by men, or by women overly influenced by patriarchy. Fortunately,Song of the Lark is available ine-book form at my library, too!"},
{"title": "Warlight", "date": "Monday, March 23, 2020", "text": "What a haunting and mysteriousnovel this is, Warlight, by Michael Ondaatje. I read a hard copy with this cover—foggy and mysterious—and you canfind the ebook with the blue cover below. I love how sometimes it is OK to judge a book by its cover!Warlight isset right after World War II, in 1945, with war’s effects all around. Twochildren—Nathaniel and Rachel—are left behind by their parents with veryinteresting guardians, caretakers, visitors…but why? What are their parentsdoing? What does it mean when their mother, Rose, returns? Why has her lifechanged so dramatically at times? How will the children cope—and survive? At thestart, Nathaniel, the son, is the 14-year-old narrator, putting together thepuzzle pieces as best he can. At times, the point of view switches tothird-person limited omniscient, to move us gently into another perspective, ina kind of, well, warlight atmosphere. Or is it still Nathaniel, once removed,as he does grow up in the novel…?This is one of those booksof great beauty. On the one hand, it can have a simple narrative style, suitedto the point-of-view character; on the other hand, it’s the quiet, poetic masteryof Michael Ondaatje. I connected to it in a strangely personal way,despite it being historical fiction, and that reinforced my sense that goodliterature is so often the perfect blend of personal and universal. Here’s myexample. I connected to this description of Rose, remembered through Marsh Felon,a man in her past who knew her as a child and now yearns for her as a woman:He wants her in his world. He knows nothing about heradult life, that she was, for instance, hesitant and shy longer than wasperhaps usual, till she stepped towards what she desired with a determinationfrom which none could prise her away—a habit she will always have, that patternof hesitancy at first and then complete involvement—just as later on, in thecoming years, nothing will draw her away from Felon, no logic of her husband,not even the responsibility of her two children.I connect particularlywith “hesitant and shy longer than was perhaps usual” and then with thedetermination, and “that pattern of hesitancy at first and then complete involvement,”though I couldn’t give up my responsibility to my own two children, as she did.Or did she? And look at how that voice sort of hovers in the fog and warlight.Who exactly is seeing this, interpreting Rose? Felon doesn’t know about her adult life, it says, yet he’s the onewanting her, remembering her, seeing her again. That’s the foggy thing aboutthe point of view.And here’s the greatuniversal question that stuck out for me: “Do we eventually become what we areoriginally meant to be?” I have asked that question many times."},

Pritzker just held a press conference to update everyone, and said he isconsidering the “shelter in place” option every day. I was so impressed with himand with Dr. Ngoke Ezike, Director of the Illinois Department of Health, fortheir earnest concern, their sharing of info, and their willingness to answerquestions from reporters—in a virtual format. The only disconcerting part waswatching what looked like more than ten people then exit the room, much closerthan 3-6 feet apart, none of them in gloves, all touching the same door/doorhandle. Sigh….Fornow, I am working at home on various things—writing and/or library related—and alternatingthese tasks with household tasks and reading, all to keep the body moving andthe worry away. But Worry is not so good at “social distancing.” It sometimesgets in my face and my brain and my chest, a little pinch there when I try tosleep at night, so I get up and read myself back to sleep. It’s hard to stayfocused, I lose track of the time and what day it is, and I feel so cold in thehouse—which always happens at this time of year, the transition to spring,before it truly warms up.Mylocal friends and my online friends are stressed, anxious, scared, worriedabout jobs as well as health, worried about kids and parents. We are all goingthrough this together, and I see so much kindness. Sadly, I see judgmentalcomments, too, and hear about mean comments. Goodness, we need to bepatient with each other as well as the situation! And I also appreciate thehumor—dark humor, gentle humor, wacky humor. And the wine. I didn’t hoard it.So it will run out. Maybe before I do! ButI did go out walking, on the last sunny day we had. It was Election Day, and Ivoted. It was St. Patrick’s Day, and I didn’t do anything particularly Irish. Idid wear green gloves at the polling place. I walked the local rails-to-trailshiking/biking path, and was pleased to see so many people out. We kept ourdistance, but most of us greeted each other with a nod or a smile. (Except thatguy coughing in the shelter. We all stayed away from him. A young man, fiddlingwith his phone.) AndI walked the labyrinth behind the cancer center, no one else there. I let mymind go where it would, and it went everywhere, and back. Just like thelabyrinth.Hang in there, everybody! Hunker at home. My heart goes out to you!"},

Berlin, a set of essays by various poets on Mental Illness, Treatment and the Creative Process. I checked it out of the library because it's what came up when I searched for work by Denise Duhamel, who judged the 2019 Patricia Dobler Award. She's a poet I have admired for many years when I encountered her work in journals, and now I have also acquired some of her recent books of poetry, all as \"homework\" for when I get to meet her in April at a reading, as this year I actually won the contest! I have entered in previous years and also recommended this contest to other eligible writers--women over forty who have not yet published a full-length book of poems. Chapbooks are OK. If you qualify, consider this another recommendation!I learned a lot about many things and was delighted to find in this book two of our Escape Into Life poets, Ren Powell and Martha Silano, as well as Chase Twichell, whose book The Practice of Poetry: Writing Exercises from Poets Who Teach, co-edited with Robin Behn, sits on a shelf above my computer, ready to grab when I need a creative push. I used it when I was teaching, and I use it now.I always love to read about a poet's process, and Poets on Prozac*, has the added interest of how mental illness, whether temporary or permanent, chronic or intermittent, and the treatment or medication for it affects the writing. Excerpts and whole poems are provided in this context, and the authors include mental health professionals who write poems.*Not everyone was on Prozac, but it was so interesting to see the lists of what people had tried, looking for the right dosage, combination, relief from pain and anxiety. It was hard to put this book down, so I read it with intense concentration, and now, as in Andy and the Lion,  by James Daugherty, it will have to go back to the library!"},

Sadly, I missed timing this post to either of the correct days, even though \"Fat Tuesday\" is one of the \"Eight Days a Week\" of this actual blog! We got Bavarian cream paczki, but now I want to try all the flavors mentioned in the WTTW article. Recently, I learned of the many flavors of Kit Kat bars & confections in Japan in an essay in this book, so I want to try those, too. I also heard a nice NPR story on paczki yesterday, and read all the pronunciations on our box from the local grocery-store bakery. Attempting to spell paczki just now, I got Ed Paschke, the Chicago artist of Polish descent, who may well be named, somehow, for the sweet, yes?

I was sensing that one of the characters, Mary Treat, who wrote letters to Charles Darwin and Asa Gray, must be a real person, and she was! A naturalist who has plants and ants named after her! I liked her a lot. In the novel, she lets a Venus flytrap gnaw on her finger.It was a lovely, busy, birthday week for me. The Poetry is Normal open mic at the library resumed for 2020. Our overall theme this year is life itself, its major events, starting with Birth, and, delightfully, our first date coincided with my actual birthday. People read poems on and mostly-on theme, by themselves or others. I gave away candy and books. Our next theme is Childhood, in April, National Poetry Month.A lovely child named Dusty is born into grief in Unsheltered and is almost ready to walk right into joy at the end.And look at this beautiful photo, by Noah Elhardt, of the kind of plant, a sundew, that Mary Treat observed and drew.

I am now reading Unsheltered, by Barbara Kingsolver. So I'm feeling a little unsheltered, thanks to empathy (and Russia). On p. 12 I found this: \"Marriages tend to harden like arteries, and she and Iano were more than thirty years into this one. This evening he would come in the door like a blast of warm weather, give her a kiss in the kitchen before changing out of his office clothes, and they'd have no chance to talk before dinner.\"It's Valentine's weekend. My husband and I have been married \"more than thirty years\" (although we tend to forget our anniversary). Yesterday, actual Valentine's Day, he came through the garage-to-kitchen door with a blast of cold weather, gave me a kiss and a volleyball summary, and went to change out of his coach clothes before our lack of dinner, as he had eaten in the coaches' hospitality room, and I had eaten a late lunch after visiting the endodontist, who took a picture of my successful root canal of a year ago. This is our life.Today, I went to see part of the intercity volleyball tournament--a fantastic setter, both excellent and lackluster playing, a loss by my husband's team. Before his girls played, we watched a couple matches side by side--his team asking, \"Coach, who's this?\" \"Wife,\" we both replied. (They don't know I'm in the stands for their home games.) When it was time to get ready he reached into his bag for his roster and pulled out my chapbook Spiritual Midwifery. (The cover is based on one of his paintings.)\"Your second poem always makes me cry,\" he said. The title poem, it's about a baby who died before it's about a baby who lived. \"The last time, I couldn't make it past that poem.\"\"You carry my book in your volleyball bag?\"\"Something to read,\" he said. We both teared up a little in the stands, the ref blowing her whistle. This is our life."},

My sister told me about this book a few years ago, when everyone on her campus read it and brought the author there to speak. It's heartbreaking and makes me want to be an activist for prison reform and against capital punishment, but I imagine there are lawyers and activists like Stevenson and his organization, the Equal Justice Initiative, who are way more qualified and already well into it. So I'll just keep working in smaller ways at the local level toward the kind of community awareness that is needed.I have not yet seen the movie based on this book, but I have seen the preview! And am eager to see the film and how they've adapted the material, which spans many years and many cases. Such patience! So many complications in the legal and criminal justice system, all clogged up further by racism. And yet the book itself is so clear, moves swiftly, breaks the heart, mends it with compassion.Our columnist Basel Al-Aswad, whose birthday is today (!), wrote about this book at Escape Into Life.

I had written it, I thought, though in the present tense, in a poem, a poem my own mother loves. It was one of those odd, slightly scary moments--a mix of fear of plagiarism and the delightful shock of recognition of an emotional or psychological truth.My poem, \"Local Patterns,\" was published way back in 2011 in Soundzine, an online magazine, that appears not to exist anymore. The link I had for it connects to a danger message. Then it was published as the \"L\" poem in my chapbook ABCs of Women's Work, published by Red Bird in 2015. The Dutch House was published in 2019, so this is 1) coincidence and/or 2) nothing I need to fear! Which is not to say that I think Ann Patchett somehow read my poem and echoed me. No, it's a strange little frisson that wiggles through me. And then to realize we have somehow echoed each other is a comfort, in various ways.I love this book--the quiet mystery, the intricate family relationships, the love and compassion.And here is my poem:Local PatternsA man and a woman walk miles togetheron sand, luminous shell.What made them last? What made them wash up whole?In winter, a train pauses beside golden weeds, nothingblooming, patchy snow.Nobody needs to get anywhere fast.  Who told us to strive?Broken open in the springa seedpod reveals the local patterns of the wind.A scientist draws that picture with a stylus on a pad, and now we knowwhat that picture looks like.On a shelf over my desk is a photographof my mother before I knew her,looking back over her dark shoulder,smiling, the corner creased.She could be anyone’s mother,but she is mine."},

If you need a break from impeachment proceedings, caucus debacles, 2020 election anxiety, and general worry about the dire state that American democracy is in, you can read about a romance/sex scandal in a parallel American political universe: Red, White & Royal Blue by Casey McQuiston. It is very funny, very sexy, and I learned a lot. For instance, I learned on p. 288 of my paperback copy (pictured here) that the King James Bible \"exists...because the Church of England was so displeased with James for flaunting his relationship with [George] Villiers that he had the translation commissioned to appease them.\" That's James I, and the King James Bible is my favorite translation still, now all the more so with this tidbit of info...gotten from a novel, so is it trustworthy? I hope so, 'cause it's a good one. Who gnu, as I like to ask. McQuiston knew, and lots of historians, and Wikipedia knows, acknowledging that \"James's sexuality is a matter of dispute.\" Who cares? We got a good Bible out of it!I saw part of the Friday debate via YouTube and New York Times video after attending local junior high volleyball. (ABC doesn't come in on my TV most of the time.) So I know that Amy got after Pete for chatting up people on the campaign about needing a break from Senate impeachment proceedings. See casual comment above that starts my blog. Mea culpa. I like Amy, and I have her hat. I like Pete, too! I really want all the current candidates to be somehow part of the next administration! What Would Lincoln Do? What Would Obama Do? That, I think. Invite everyone to the table. (Speaking of the King James Bible, that's also what Jesus would do.) But Amy is right that it's serious business, those Senate proceedings, and what responsible legislators do do! (Oops, I said \"do do.\")And, speaking (earlier) of Waiting for Godot on Groundhog's Day, and in Sarajevo, I saw our local production of Waiting for Godot last night.

It was really good, but slow going, as it is a fat book. Sort of like a beautiful hike in thick snow.* Susan Sontag was a fascinating woman, that's for sure, full of inconsistencies. I even read the notes, finding this gem, a comment by photographer Lisette Model on Sontag's book On Photography: \"It is a book by a woman who knows everything and understands nothing.\"*Sontag might not like my comparison, as she was \"against metaphor\" (in her book Against Metaphor) but, as I learned in Moser's book, sometimes not even able to recognize metaphors in other people's writing--one of the odd inconsistencies!This morning I know nothing and understand nothing about the results of the Iowa caucuses and what went wrong in reporting them. That is, I know what's been reported but not the full truth, nor the actual results.

Waiting for Godot, forever, over and over again, on Groundhog's Day, the way Bill Murray has to repeat his day until he gets it right? Hey, has Bill Murray ever done the play Waiting for Godot? I do not know and don't have time to Google it before church, on Candlemas Day, which, according to this CNN article, is the origin of Groundhog's Day! The article also tells us that the groundhog in Pennsylvania predicts an early spring. It's sunny here in Illinois, so I guess we get six more weeks of winter. (And I guess we'll find out whether some people would like to repeat this Super Bowl Sunday until they get it right, but then they will have to watch all those political commercials over and over...)OK, what I wanted to tell you was how, once again, I am reading a book at exactly the right time. This week I will go see Waiting for Godot at Heartland Theatre, and this morning, in Sontag, I am reading about Waiting for Godot in Sarajevo. Susan Sontag directed a production of Waiting for Godot, by Samuel Beckett, during terrifying wartime conditions in Sarajevo in 1993, to help bring attention to the situation, where genocide was going on--\"ethnic cleansing\"--and the world was ignoring it, despite the Holocaust of World War II which we were never to forget. She did wake up the world and was appreciated for it; the plaza in front of Bosnia's National Theatre was named Susan Sontag Square in her honor. And she brought Annie Leibovitz there, to take pictures for Vanity Fair, which brought even more attention to Sarajevo. Then Sontag went home and continued to be annoying.To make it a perfect Random Coinciday in the blog, my Hollywood issue of Vanity Fair has just arrived, my last issue, as any money formerly spent on renewals or subscriptions now goes to political candidates. Heads up, political candidates, all my \"subscriptions\" to you have also run out. But I'll be voting on March 17 and November 3, you can count on it! Which brings me back to Beckett. Or, rather, back to Benjamin Moser, author of Sontag, who says, \"If a condition of the modern artist--of the modern person--is awareness that Godot will not be turning up, that does not mean that that person is not needed, cannot make some difference.\" That person--actor, director, reader, writer, voter--can!

{"title": "The Mutual UFO Network", "date": "Friday, January 31, 2020", "text": "It turns out the Mutual UFO Network is a real organization, but I'm talking about The Mutual UFO Network, a marvelous book of short stories by Lee Martin. In the title story, the narrator's father sells a sort of \"fake news\" to people who believe in UFOs. \"In my own home, my parents operated a mail-order business called The Mutual UFO Network. My father transferred computer-generated images to videotape and created illusions of spaceships streaking across the night sky.\" He then sold his wares to people \"who wanted proof that what they'd suspected all along was indeed true: there were visitors from other planets, and they were indeed watching us.\" I wonder what the real organization thinks about the book! Also, I see from the Wikipedia article that the founder of MUFON lived in Illinois, and so did Lee Martin for a time. Coincidence?This is a beautiful book. The characters in it are deep and complicated, flawed and lovable anyway. They suffer, they hurt, they love, they misbehave, and then, amazingly, so many of them are so decent, so compassionate, so capable of change. These are stories about people who yearn for reparation, transformation, some way to do the right thing after, sometimes, doing the wrong thing. I read this at exactly the right time, as I am watching people obstinately doing the wrong thing when they could do the right thing. This book gives me hope. Yes, it's fiction, but it's realistic, not escapist or genre fiction, where things may turn out all right but not necessarily in a believable way, more in a formulaic way. Nothing formulaic here, just wonderfully organic meanderings (not manipulative twists) and (motivated) turns. I follow Lee Martin's blog, and you can, too. It's listed on the right of my blog here. He teaches at Ohio State University, and his blog gives generous and practical writing advice.And I'm still reading Sontag, where AIDS has struck, in the early 1980s, and, true to form, Susan Sontag doesn't want her story about AIDS to be thought of as a story about AIDS. And she's not aware of new information about children of alcoholics, either, in a book by Janet B. Woititz, who sees adult children of alcoholics as stuck between \"Always tell the truth\" and \"I don't want to know.\" As Sontag author Benjamin Moser summarizes, \"She called the conflict between demanding the truth and not wanting to know it 'the greatest paradox.'\" AKA denial.What I see in Lee Martin and in many of his characters is deep acceptance. In the characters, it may come after a period of denial. Denial, or meth, or alcohol, or sex may blunt the suffering for a while, take the edge off, but the suffering is there underneath, raw and waiting. Martin as a writer has acceptance and character, and he allows his main characters to experience acceptance, which leads them to action. His characters acquire nobility. By being human."},

I'm reading slowly and steadily, aware that it will lead me to re-read On Photography, which is actually on my bookshelf, and Against Interpretation, which is not. Unless it is on a small bookshelf elsewhere in the house. I remember reading parts of it years ago, maybe in college? Maybe in my parents' house? Anyway, it's interesting to be looking at the decades of her life, some of which overlap my own, from the context of now, in the \"hindsight is 2020\" mode of the year 2020, as we begin it. Capitalist consumerism has indeed taken over and led to excesses of all sorts, down to the situation that puts us in the middle of impeachment proceedings, and the strange argument that a sitting president can do anything he wants to win an election. Uh oh. This just turned into a ran...dom coinciday! (And a Thor's Day in the blog.)The image above is the book cover, its front and its spine. The cover portrait is a photo by Richard Avedon. Benjamin Moser understands Sontag by reading her journals, private, as well as her published works. Reading it gives me pause, as happens whenever I read a biography. I've kept a journal for thirty years. Do I ever want anyone to read it? Don't I keep it primarily to hold myself together? To vent? To keep track of things for personal reference? I think so. Whenever Moser mentions that Sontag barely mentioned her son David in her journals, I worry if anything I say about my kids, or omit, would cause them pain. When he notes that major political/historical events are occurring, and she's writing about herself, her personal woes, I think, yes, this is a personal diary! The other things can be discussed in public forums. Sigh...  And then I immerse myself again, grateful to see the intellectual and critical ideas of the age laid out so clearly."},

I learned more about cryonics and the desire of the super-rich to live forever than I had heretofore picked up via popular culture and Fututama. I enjoyed McKibben's use of the hookworm as a metaphor for a disease that has struck the rich: \"We need to diagnose the intellectual and spiritual hookworm that has entered their bodies and attached itself to their brains.\" That hookworm turns out to be Ayn Rand! I was amazed at how many people in high places are hooked on Ayn Rand. I read The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged as an adolescent, on the recommendation of my uncle, and now I understand him a little better. Sadly, he's dead, and Rand's influence seems not to have helped him live a better, longer life. (Cigarettes.) I guess I thought she was mostly an adolescent fixation, and people outgrew her, like I did. I guess not.After Falter-ing, I'll need to read Dark Money, by Jane Mayer, but I don't really want to know more about dark money than Falter taught me, alas. And I discovered that I had already read the futurist and A.I. materials that might come next after these ideas. Instead, though, I turned to a novel for relief...though it grappled with difficult stuff to learn about being human, too: Right After the Weather, by Carol Anshaw. I was attracted to it because its main character is a set designer in Chicago! It was a good read.Speaking of the weather, bitter winter has arrived! So has the first poem of the new year, which has a little snow in it. And a boombox. And Cole Porter. And that reminds me that I want to hear Harry Connick, Jr. sing the songs of Cole Porter on his new album, True Love.

So I hope to learn a lot.I am reading it on a Slattern Day (in the blog), after doing a lot of housework these past few days, post-holiday. My daughter and her boyfriend left last weekend, and my son left on Tuesday, and I took down the Christmas tree the very next day. A bit of a sentimental slattern, I should confess that this was the same Christmas tree that was up and decorated since the previous Christmas. It was my hope in the dark all last year. No doubt I will do a bit more housework yet today, rousing myself from rest and reading, because it's still there to do. It has occurred to me that I should wear kneepads for cleaning the toilets. TMI?I just finished reading No Crybabies Allowed, a delightful memoir of the first 12 years of her life by Terri Ryburn. I'm in a writing group with Terri and went to her book release reading on December 29 at Ryburn Place, her shop in the restored Sprague Super Service, along the 1926 configuration of Route 66. She also wrote a book about Route 66! Her memoir is in vignette style, and I have heard her read or tell excerpts from it before, and she is a stand-up comedian, so there's a lot of humor here, and poignancy. This volume ends in Oregon with a sneak preview of Volume 2. You can get it at her shop or on Amazon.My fingerprints are faltering. My work with paper, plastic sleeves, booktape, and glue-dissolving cleansers--plus, probably, age and dryness--is apparently rubbing them off. This poses a wee bit of a problem as we set up my new phone to recognize my faltering fingerprint!

{"title": "What I Meant to Write Yesterday", "date": "Monday, January 6, 2020", "text": "Aclipping* from a Hilton Als review in TheNew Yorker has been sitting on my computer desk for a long time. It’s atheatre review titled “Frozen” about a revival of The Iceman Cometh by Eugene O’Neill. It’s from the May 7, 2018issue, but it hasn’t been sitting by my desk that long—only since my mom passed several issues along to me to read before recycling. I was struckby Als’s reverence for one young actor’s fine acting.Alsdescribes the kind of acting I like to see, I hope do, and, when I teach or direct, try to encourage or inspire…or at least explain. Sometimes I try to describe it via difference, or, to put it in adramatic conflict form, as Acting vs Performing. Some actors are mainly performers—maybewith great skill and panache—but still “acting,” not acting, still performing. They may prefer performingto acting, it may feel more fun and/or more secure; it may seem to get themmore jobs, since it’s a way of calling attention to themselves, and sometimesaudiences don’t really see the difference. But many audience members do, andsome directors do, and other actors, and critics like this one. Here, praisingAustin Butler, Hilton Als beautifully explains the acting vs performing thing:Most performers want tobe seen at any cost, but actors—at least those as good as Butler—are bothdetermined and relaxed in their ambition to do justice to the playwright’s textwhile contributing to the life of the story. Butler, making his Broadway debut... illustrates,the moment he takes the stage, the difference between the two. …[H]e conveys,through economy of movement and facial expression, what many of his cast-matestry to show by shouting and grandstanding: his character’s inner life.Iloved the little moment during the Golden Globes last night when Fleabag writer and actor PhoebeWaller-Bridge made fun of herself while praising her director even though shewas the writer and thought a scene was meant to go a certain way. How lovelythat she could try a little harder and see another way of making it work!Hereis Hilton Als again on the issue, still in the context of The Iceman Cometh:It’s always a pity whenan actor cynically sticks to what he knows will work and leaves it at that.It’s an ungenerous impulse not to try harder than one has to, and it pinchesthe spectator’s heart. But Butler is the opposite of cynical. He wants to doright by O’Neill, his director, and his fellow-players. And, no matter how muchthey bray around him, he stands his ground, reacting to what may be pure inthem, as performers, with his own purity, the wellspring of his work, which isthat of a potentially great artist.Realacting gets real respect.*Andnow I can recycle the clipping!"},

Iwatched it on the verge of tears, via Netflix, with my husband and son, a sortof surprise. We saw it on the evening we said goodbye to my daughter and herboyfriend, who return to Oregon tomorrow and their jobs on Monday. It’s been alovely holiday. I joke about almost all movies I’ve seen lately, saying, “It’sa Christmas movie!” and I had to say the same about Little Women in the theatre this holiday season and just now about The Two Popes thanks to 1) the subjectmatter and 2) the fabulous red and white costumes of the Cardinals.WhyI loved The Two Popes: it’s funny, it’sdeep, it’s well acted, it’s about the essential stuff: love, compassion, error,forgiveness, authenticity, the ability to change. And the two popes, who arereal. It’s stylish, down to the credits. The music is terrific. The switchesfrom color to black and white. Ratzinger/Anthony Hopkins reminds me of my dad.I’mnot Catholic. My husband is. He loved it and predicts Best Picture for thisfilm. We’ve also seen The Irishmanand Marriage Story. I’ve seen Little Women and Knives Out and A BeautifulDay in the Neighborhood. I haven’t seen Jokeror Parasite or Judy or Just Mercy.Eventually I will. I love movies. I love to see the nominees before the awardscome out. For many, many years, I did no such thing. Babies!*Myhusband is Catholic, and Cuban. Today he received his Ancestry dot com results.I had given him an early Christmas gift and (forgotten 30th) anniversary (December 16) gift, and the results arrived via email today. It was exciting tosee his ancestry map. Mine (seen earlier) was pretty much what I expected,mostly European/Eastern European, mostly Irish and Hungarian. Hiswas also as expected, though surprisingly rich. Mostly Spanish, as he knew his grandfatherwas from Spain, with Portugal in there, too. And half Indigenous Americanpeoples (via Mexico) and French, based on his Cuban grandmother, descended fromindigenous people and a Frenchman. I was the one who predicted Africa, and this appears tobe true. So we are as mixed as we thought! Somehow it all fits inwith The Two Popes.*Thisbaby is my grandniece, Lincoln, with her new Lincoln rubber duckie, a Christmasgift from me.

{"title": "Paper Cut to the Lip", "date": "Sunday, December 22, 2019", "text": "'Tis the season, licking Christmas cards, of a paper cut to the lip. I'm not complaining. It's an odd little celebration, an acceptance of the small annoyances that can accompany mainly joyful action! And a total coincidence, as I came into my office with Hope in the Dark, by Rebecca Solnit, which I had just finished reading, to share a few quotations with you, got sidetracked by the current cards, including one to Chief Art Acevedo of Houston Police Department, who spoke up courageously in support of sensible gun legislation, in rage and woe upon losing an officer due to the \"boyfriend loophole.\" \"You're either here for women and children and our daughters and our sisters and our aunts, or you're here for the NRA,\" he said, pressing for legislators to renew the Violence Against Women Act (which, despite the sound of its title is to help prevent violence against women.) Sigh... I am happy to cut my lip licking an envelope for a Christmas card thanking him!I am aware of the irony of the strong either/or statement above, and Solnit general's support of the understanding that not everything is either/or.Solnit has noticed, and so have I, how so many people disparage laws or victories as not being enough. Any good thing gets the \"yes but\" response. In her Afterword to the 3rd edition of her book, she says, \"I have found, during my adventures in squandering time on social media, that a lot of people respond to almost any achievement, positive development, or outright victory with 'yes but.'\" I have noticed that exact phenomenon over and over again on social media...which means, of course, that I need to squander less time there...but also that such naysayers might want to listen to Solnit and avoid what she terms a \"naive cynicism\" that reinforces patterns of despair, identification with losing, and dependence upon a self-defeating perfectionism.\"Perfectionists often position themselves on the sidelines, from which they point out that nothing is good enough,\" says Solnit. And even if they are activists, and I've seen this at the local level, their griping undercuts their own work or the work of others for their own or related causes. In the perfectionist's view, \"Everything that's not perfect is failed, disappointing, a betrayal. There's idealism there, but also unrealistic expectations, ones that cannot meet with anything but disappointment.\"Solnit's book has been great to encounter at year's end and in midlife, as I review my past and my present. I've realized I grew up in an atmosphere of nothing being quite good enough, and it's taken years to shed habits of perfectionism that can so easily attach to a more reasonable striving for excellence, as in \"A thing worth doing is a thing worth doing well.\" I hope I approach art and life that way but with reasonable expectations and acceptance of my flaws!Getting back to activism, as Rebecca Solnit points out, \"The naively cynical measure a piece of legislation, a victory, a milestone not against the past or the limits of the possible but against their ideas of perfection, and as this book reminds you, perfection is a yardstick by which everything falls short.\" I'm glad I read it, and glad I have a wrinkly, rolled-up measuring tape instead.Merry Christmas, and Happy Poinsettias to you, if I am not back here before the day in question! And Happy New Year, likewise!"},
{"title": "Hope in the Dark", "date": "Wednesday, December 18, 2019", "text": "I've been reading Hope in the Dark, by Rebecca Solnit, to give me, yes, hope in the dark. It was first published back in 2004, so this is a third edition, published by Haymarket Books in 2016, with an updated Foreword and Afterword to give new context to hopeful thinking that continues even now. Even now.I picked it up at the ongoing library book sale, meaning I am supporting my library and its non-profit foundation, and started reading it December 1, the beginning of Advent. This cover is perfect, bright white like stars on a dark night. When I set it down, I set it down beside a Christmas card of white lights on a snowy tree in a dark night, with \"Silent Night\" printed beside the image, a card from my next-door neighbor. The book is part of my holiday decorating now. Along with ebony heads from Africa and a black mask from Mexico, and a silver bird.What's so wonderful, comforting, and inspiring about this book is its embrace of uncertainty and its recorded knowledge of how small, steady acts of quiet resistance or concerted protest moved people to continue to act and change things. Small acts led to big changes, and that is ongoing, and I am participating in this in my own small, steady, local ways. Hope in in the Dark keeps me from despair, yes, and keeps me steadily working. Here, for example, is a paragraph that inspires me, from the Foreword to this third edition:Hope locates itself in the premises that we don't know what will happen and that in the spaciousness of uncertainty is room to act. When you recognize uncertainty, you recognize that you may be able to influence the outcomes---you alone or you in concert with a few dozen or several million others. Hope is an embrace of the unknown and the unknowable, an alternative to the certainty of both optimists and pessimists. Optimists think it will all be fine without our involvement; pessimists take the opposite position; both excuse themselves from acting. It's the belief that what we do matters even though how and when it may matter, who and what it may impact, are not things we can know beforehand. We may not, in fact, know them afterward either, but they matter all the same, and history is full of people whose influence was most powerful after they were gone.I do live among optimists and pessimists, people who choose not to act, and people who cannot tolerate uncertainty. I sympathize with them all but tend to align myself with and gravitate toward those of us who reside in uncertainty, even paradox. Both seem truer to me than most certainties the world offers.I also recently read How to Fight Anti-Semitism, by Bari Weiss, very enlightening and inspiring. She grew up in the Pittsburgh neighborhood of the Tree of Life synagogue where the terrible mass shooting took place. She had to worry about whether her father was there...he wasn't! (I went to college with her father!) Bari Weiss has hope and offers practical advice. I wrote it all down in my reading journal. She speaks her truth, however controversial, however...certain.And look at the coincidence of black and white. I'd add her book to my holiday decor, but it was a library book, a new one, a 7-day book, and I already took it back to share with other readers.Oh, my dears. Hang on, hang on in the darkness. It is the season of light!"},

Marmee (Mrs. March) goes to Washington to tend March in his severe illness. I was amazed at how pertinent this seemed:It came to me that if the fortunes of this war do not turn, then maybe the city is destined to be no more than this: ruins, merely, sinking back into the swamp; the shards of an optimistic moment when a few dreamers believed you could build a nation upon ideas such as liberty and equality.Wow! We hear all the \"draining the swamp\" talk, and here it's geographical as well as metaphorical: sinking back into the swamp. The Civil War then is a bit like the civil war now, with our volatile divisiveness. And, indeed, if we don't turn things around, and soon, our democracy is at great risk, and our country will only sink further.It makes me sad.But I did file my papers today to run again as a precinct committeeperson to help get out the vote and to help local people stay energized and informed.

After a busy week of meetings and events, including a story slam last night, I am having a grand Slattern Day today, of rest, reading, grocery shopping, and an at-home movie, borrowed from the library.

{"title": "Her Firstborn", "date": "Friday, September 13, 2019", "text": "I just re-read a book of short stories, Swim Back to Me, by Ann Packer, because I had noticed what I wrote down in my reading journal from the first time I read this book and wanted to revisit the whole experience. Such wonderful stories, linked by character or theme so that the book somehow holds together as...a whole. The first time, I was struck by certain things in the closing story, \"Things Said or Done,\" about regrets. That story's title comes from a stanza of the Yeats poem \"Vacillation.\"     Things said or done long years ago,     Or things I did not do or say     But thought that I might say or do,     Weigh me down, and not a day     But something is recalled,     My conscience or my vanity appalled.Yes, I get that. And I was very moved and astonished by \"Things Said and Done,\" particularly a woman's insight about what she did wrong in her marriage based on her upbringing: \"I began picking at him over tiny annoyances--because the big annoyance, the fact that he wasn't paying enough attention to me, was too unreasonable for me to recognize at that point, let alone communicate. When I wasn't picking at him I was picking at the rest of mankind, going on and on about some slight, a minor social disappointment, an achievement inadequately rewarded. I was twenty-five, I thought it was just a matter of time before people shaped up and started acting as I wanted. Such is the lot of the narcissist's child, to inherit her parent's umbrage over the world's indifference.\" Well said. I won't say why.But this time I was struck by something in the penultimate story, \"Her Firstborn.\" A man is coming to understand something about his wife, who was married before. He's \"had it all wrong: it isn't that Lise had a baby who died, but rather that she had a baby, who died.\" Yes, exactly.Tonight I saw a lovely production of a lovely play, The Electric Baby, by Stefanie Zadravec, about a baby who glows like the moon...and about regrets. There's a woman picking at her husband in a troubled marriage. There's a young woman at the cradle of her firstborn.This was the night of the full moon. This was a wonderful \"random coinciday.\""},

Thetitle poem is in honor of another book with the same title about actualmidwifery, at a place called The Farm, where women could go have naturalchildbirth during a time in the USA when hospital labor & delivery were thenorm. Midwives were prevented from doing their work during that time. Now thereis a nice balance, with nurse midwives helping women throughout theirpregnancies and with all kinds of childbirth experiences.

I try to remember to wear my name tag so I can help people, but often I don't, as name tags are cumbersome and at times downright hazardous when you are in tech services. Interestingly, it is usually when I am not wearing a name tag that patrons ask me for help.I think I am like a \"cat magnet.\" You know how a cat will seek out the one person in the room who is not fond of cats (my mom) and jump up into her lap? I don't mean that I am not fond of patrons (though it's true I do not want them to jump into my lap); I mean that I am a shy person, an introvert, and I suspect I attract equally shy and/or introverted patrons who want to ask a question of a quiet, non-threatening library-looking person who is not very customer service oriented or trained. I love helping patrons find just the right book or audiobook or movie! I don't know how to work any of the machines--copy machine, fax machine, scanner, public computers--so I go get real circulation staff for that.Anyway, what I'm getting at here is that recently I went upstairs with my cart on a tech services project, paused to help a patron, went into the workroom to do so, and came back thinking, \"Dude, where's my cart?\" I knew I had pulled it out of the way, but where, exactly?! Never fear, I found it, and now I can recommend that, if you are local, you go see the 10-Minute Plays at Heartland, this year all on the theme of The Library. They are hilarious and poignant and well-written and well-performed. Every weekend in June! They made me laugh, they made me cry, and no one said, \"Dude, where's my cart?\"Darn it, I should have written that play!And here's a random but nice announcement. Patricia Clark, a poet I admire, just won a contest I also entered, The Fourth River Folio Contest. As I am always a finalist, never Miss America, I was once again a finalist, and honored to be one! If I were not such a shy introvert I might be Miss Congeniality. Or if I were an undercover FBI agent. Yay for Patricia Clark, who is also one of our poets at Escape Into Life! If you read this interview with Patricia Clark at EIL, you'll see her connection to nature, some cool art by Tim Simmons, and be set up for a fine random coincidence of the sort I love.

My husband and I drove her sturdy little used Miata (not this one), and she and her boyfriend drove his car, the backseat and trunk full of their essential belongings. (We unloaded their heavier belongings from a U-Haul pod, delivered to their new apartment.) Our country is beautiful, just as the song says! Spacious skies! Purple (purple?) mountain majesties!When we got home, our reliable but broken red Ford Focus wagon still sat in the driveway, falling apart. New tires! Still starts! But the bottom might drop out. My little old (1991) blue Ford Escort wagon still sat in the garage awaiting me, its license plates not yet electronically redacted. It was time to get another reliable used car. In Peoria, via Craigslist. As you can see, it is a two-toned Miata. Somewhat tensely, I drove the little blue wagon to Peoria and back, not sure it would withstand 65 miles per hour. It did! But I needed the glass of wine.I have yet to drive the Miata.Portland, by the way, is also beautiful! We saw both sun and rain, we hiked a forested trail, we visited the Saturday market and Powell's City of Books and all 4 of the city's quarters.

People keep stopping me to say how much they liked it, how thought provoking it was, how much they appreciated Heartland Theatre Company for doing it. So, yay! And, strangely, I learned a lot about what it is and what it means to be human. There are four characters in the play. One is A.I. throughout, one is human throughout, and two of us got to be both, and we both felt the difference. I felt not just like A.I. but, in a way, like a Buddhist. I like the play better than the movie, though the movie has a stellar cast, in case you ever seek it out. I advise seeking out a live theatre production, though!Then I went to Chicago for four days to discuss human nature with a lovely bunch of coconuts via a wide array of readings (excerpts). We also visited the Illinois Holocaust Museum in Skokie--to ponder again what humans do to other humans--and asked questions of a survivor who is, for museum purposes, also a hologram.Now (again, forever) it is snowing, and I must decide whether to go out in it and for which reason: candidate forum or volleyball regionals.

Terri will also introduce me at the next release reading, November 15, 2018, at the Normal Public Library, which I hope will also be a release reading for Spiritual Midwifery, due out from Red Bird Chapbooks before the end of the year! (here is my Author Page at Red Bird from my previous book with them, ABCs of Women's Work, the one with the perfect cover, where I am invisible! See alphabet sampler below.) And here is the cover of The Towns, in a picture taken by Terri Ryburn.I loved reading to a room full of attentive, warm, loving people in Terri's Route 66 shop, full of interesting arts and crafts and Route 66 doodads. I was wearing my Route 66 earrings, made by Marcia Hirst, who was in the audience, with more of her handmade earrings dangling close behind her. The Tingleys were there, a couple who lived in Towanda, Illinois when I first knew them, and the first poem I read was \"Towanda.\" Family came, women I write with, lovely people from our community. I got to refer to the towns in the poems on a map right behind me, showing that some are are Route 66 and some require you to exit. The audience also enjoyed and/or got chilled by my accounts of outlaws along the Natchez Trace, also represented in The Towns.And I was pleased that my listeners enjoyed learning about my process, and about how the poems connected to two other books: The Triggering Town, by Richard Hugo, and The Outlaw Years, by Robert M. Coates. And those of you know how much I love random coincidii will be delighted to know The Outlaw Years was published in 1930, the same year the structure I was in, originally a service station on Route 66, had been built. I did not read the title poem, since it always makes me cry, but I might read it at the library, anyway.Sorry I've been so silent here. I swam all summer, often with a duck, and went to Santa Cruz, California. Life has been busy. And wonderful."},

But I do have two poems just out in online venues: \"Vintage Hunger\" in Redheaded Stepchild, a home for rejected poems, and \"In the Future Library\" in Poetry Porch, a virtual porch.Meanwhile, my first roses opened today, Memorial Day, like sudden wounds. The blue and the purple spiderwort are blooming. The white anemone. The cottage pinks. The long, long cold, snowy April caused many shorter plants this spring, I see, but I am glad they are blooming. I am still sprinkling perennial seeds where I can, and zinnias, and we'll see what happens later in the summer.And there is poetry up at Escape Into Life, too, where I am poetry editor: a Mother's Day post, and a between Mother's Day and Father's Day feature by Susan Slaviero! So I kept at it, though absent here, alas. I feel very busy and spread thin. But very happy it's finally spring, and hot, and flowery.The rose above is a past rose, a photo taken by my daughter!"},

For me, it was exactly the right time to read Lillian Boxfish Takes a Walk, by Kathleen Rooney. I've been wanting to read it since it first came out, and though I did read the hardback, the paperback has just come out, and Kathleen Rooney will be presenting it, via Surprise Bookshelf series, at the American Writers Museum in Chicago today, at 5:30 p.m.! Wooee! I recently (St. Patrick's Day) visited the American Writers Museum, and it's wonderful. Kathleen Rooney and her husband, Martin Seay, also a novelist, are coming to our town in August to read from their work at the library. I'm sure I will read Martin Seay's book, The Mirror Thief, at exactly the right time (before he comes to town), too!Also, it's National Poetry Month, and Lillian Boxfish is a poet and an ad writer, the highest paid woman in advertising in America! She is based on the real highest-paid woman in advertising of her day, Margaret Fishback, who was powerful and respected and well paid before the era of Mad Men, to give us some perspective. But it was still the era of having to leave work if you got pregnant, as there was no maternity leave and employers did not hold jobs for women who had babies or men who went to war. To give it further perspective.This is an utterly charming book. The end papers of my hardback edition show a map of where Lillian walked. As a child, Lillian was inspired by another career woman, her aunt Sadie, a nurse at St. Vincent's Hospital in New York City in the early 1900s, which is crucial here due to the flu epidemic of 1918. And Edna St. Vincent Millay got her middle name from that hospital/saint! She's a favorite poet of mine. On with poetry month!"},

What a powerful book. Contemporary cartoonists \"adapt\" (interpret, illustrate) poems from the Great War, whether by the actual Trench Poets (poets who really served in the trenches) or others connected to that war. I reviewed it over at Escape Into Life, and should review more poetry books there this month, National Poetry Month, but I am a fast/slow reader of poetry. Even if I whiz through a book on first read, like eating M&Ms, I then slow down and go poem by poem, taking notes, savoring, mulling....um, to pursue the original simile, sucking off the candy coating to get to the chocolate. No, that doesn't apply at all to most poetry I read! Never mind.At EIL, we are celebrating National Poetry Month with poems about poetry! Be sure to read the current solo feature by Christine Klocek-Lim, who has another poem in a mini-anthology coming up next week with other EIL poets.And I hope I do a better job here in April, keeping up with my own blog posts on poetry, reading, and random coincidii.

Now I will be very interested to see how all the internal musing manifests in the film. I jotted down this snippet of dialogue between Elio and Marzia about readers:     \"People who read are hiders. They hide who they are. People who hide don't always like who they are.\"     \"Do you hide you who are?\"     \"Sometimes. Don't you.\"     \"Do I? I suppose.\"I guess it's mainly the comment on readers as hiders that interests me. Are they? Are you? She is afraid of revealing that she likes reading. Why? Not all readers are hiders, surely. I do think some (many) are introverts and armchair travelers. It's like Emily Dickinson's poem, \"I never saw a moor.\"It's National Poetry Month, and 1) I am again writing a poem a day 2) as a blogger have recommitted to at least one blog entry per week devoted to poetry. I committed and then failed, dropping into woe over Parkland and snow, marched for our lives in snow....but here I am again, now about to quote more from Call Me By Your Name, by Andre Aciman, this time about poetry.They are in a restaurant after a bookstore reading. A late arriving guest proposes a toast: \"But if the job of poetry, like that of wine, is to make us see double, then I propose another toast until we've drunk enough to see the world with four eyes--and, if we're not careful, with eight.\"Then Elio muses on his favorite poem from the reading, the San Clemente poem, and how it connects to his life: \"As we ambled down an emptied labyrinth of sparely lit streets, I began to wonder what all this talk of San Clemente had to do with us--how we move through time, how time moves through us, how we change and keep changing and come back to the same. One could even grow old and not learn a thing but this. That was the poet's lesson, I presume.\"I connected strongly with this, that \"one could even grow old and not learn a thing but this.\" I feel I have been learning it."},

I never would have imagined myself directing a football play with a pedophile in it, but it has been a marvelous experience, working with a great cast and creative team and a rock star stage manager and her fabulous assistant. Good stuff all around. If you are local (I almost wrote \"loyal\"), come see it!The play was written in response to the Jerry Sandusky scandal at Penn State and has similar but different circumstances. It was awful to have the Larry Nasser scandal in the news at the same time we were working on the play, reminding us that this keeps going on and nothing fully protects kids from it. What should we do about that?The local paper did a great feature story on the production, and the review is up today. Many thanks to all who have been working on the show and helping to get the word out. It takes courage to work on this one, and to see it!"},

Apparently, I forgot to eat breakfast. This may have been because I accidentally washed my hair and had to dry it before going out into the resumed bitter cold. (Italics to emphasize bitterness.)I needed to leave early for work to have time to take  about 100 letters to the post office so they would arrive 1) before the March 20 primary election (plenty of time for that!) and 2) before a local candidate forum on February 6 (less time for that). I think I made it, even though our letters now go to another town before returning to our own. I am on this particular ballot, as Precinct Committeeman,* and we have candidates to choose to run for Governor, Attorney General, and state and county offices.In the wee hours, before I accidentally washed my hair, and when I could have been eating breakfast, I was instead finishing up an enthralling book, The First Bad Man, by Miranda July. I had read one of her short stories recently and liked her movie Me and You and Everyone We Know (our family's kind of quirky comedy), so it was time to read her novel.*\"man\" is part of the official name of the office, but we like to think of ourselves as people"},
{"title": "Blue Blood Moon", "date": "Wednesday, January 31, 2018", "text": "I have been observing the moon this week and will gaze up again tonight, but did not go out in the early morning today to try to glimpse the super blue blood moon in its full (but locally cloud covered) glory. I did, however, imagine a blue blood moon for this poem, \"Blue Blood Moon,\" published in Stirring in December of 2011. The last super blue blood moon was November 30/December 1, 1982, and I probably noticed it but without all the hype way back then. The poem's blue blood moon is milder, not super, and apparently connected to the speaker's mood. So that's a random coincidence for a Random Coinciday in the blog.Here's another one:Nancy Heather Brown, a retired public television producer who now writes for Escape Into Life, wrote about women's rights and the state of the union as she sees it, among many other related things, for instance, \"[p]atriarchy at is worst,\" in this piece, \"Life in the Box: Venus Marches On.\" Summing up the 20th-century book, Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus, she said:One of my main take-aways from that book is that men tend toward hierarchical relationships—where people are one-up or one-down from each other. And women tend to believe everyone’s equal.My other reading this week included various articles and stories in old New Yorker magazines that now need to be recycled. I was taken by a piece on the artist Laura Owens, who, the New Yorker writer Peter Schjeldahl tells has had \"a keen interest in whatever her peers were up to, eschewing competitiveness.\" That makes sense to me, and I take a keen interest in what my poet peers are up to, and my fellow theatre artists, because mutual support is important to me, and we can inspire and motivate each other without needing to be rivals. Imagine my delight to see Laura Owens quoted as saying, \"It's debilitating to think that this person is above me and this person is below me. I want to be in a conversation with someone.\" And it would be a conversation of equals, evidently, and Owens seems to be a Venus, and Nancy Heather Brown might also enjoy this Random Coinciday in the blog."},

The books engage me, distract me, and bring me back to the world.I love books that show how people's lives intersect, and that's what's going on in A Secret Sisterhood: The Literary Friendships of Jane Austen, Charlotte Bronte, George Eliot and Virginia Woolf, by Emily Midorikawa & Emma Claire Sweeney. (Part of the fun of this book is that it was written by a literary friendship!) Turns out each of the writers in the subtitle had a special woman friend who tends to get ignored or overlooked in literary history, so these two writers have improved literary history. I knew about the \"rivalry\" part of the literary friendship of Virginia Woolf and Katherine Mansfield, but I did not really know how friendly they were. They were!I've known that Who Thought This Was a Good Idea? by Alyssa Mastromonaco was on the bestseller list, and I keep watching for it to appear at the library. It hasn't yet, as it is available in electronic and audio forms. But I got it for Christmas, and I do love reading hard copy. It is a funny and informative book by the former White House Deputy Chief of Staff to President Obama. It goes really well with Veep.When not working, editing, reading, or unwinding to Julia Louis-Dreyfus as Vice President, I am directing For the Loyal, by Lee Blessing, at Heartland Theatre, so my head is full of football, acting notes, and sound cues."},
{"title": "Baby Shampoo", "date": "Saturday, January 6, 2018", "text": "Today I washed my hair with baby shampoo. It's my husband's shampoo, as he has baby-fine hair, and I used it 1) to empty & recycle the bottle and 2) to smell and feel again that baby-fine feeling of washing my babies' heads. My grown-up babies have gone back to their grown-up lives after a lovely holiday visit, and I miss them. As Kim Kishbaugh puts it in her blog entry about her adult son leaving after the holiday, I am bereft.I am also busy, working and directing a play, and that is helping me through. But today is a day of rest, in which I am doing heaps and heaps of laundry and changing the sheets on all the beds. (But not taking down the Christmas tree.)Over the break, I read a few books, including The Awkward Age, by Francesa Segal. It's about a second relationship for two people in midlife, parents of teenage children from their first marriages. The kids are at \"the awkward age\" and the complications put quite a strain on the adults' relationship, not to mention making the teenagers' own lives full of, well, angst. I know I had an awkward age as a teen and plenty of angst, but, as parents, we did not encounter any trouble from our teenage children, who got through adolescence with quite a bit of grace! We all got lucky there.Francesca Segal also wrote The Innocents, a re-telling of sorts of The Age of Innocence by Edith Wharton, something my book group read and I enjoyed. It made me re-read the Wharton novel and long to re-see the movie. Reading provides me with comfort when I am bereft, or anticipating my grief, as well the downtime I need as an introvert during the socializing of the holidays. This year I was reading as my family played Parcheesi. There I sat in the same room, cuddled in a blanket, watching and listening to them play as I read my novel. Parcheesi crams my math-challenged head with numbers and counting. I was probably closer to my kids and husband reading than I would have been playing, stressed out, rubbing my forehead, madly counting. It was a quiet bliss.Happy New Year!"},

But that's not the coincidence! The coincidence is that Pops for Champagne, a champagne bar, popped into my mind, maybe because it is almost New Year's Eve, which involved champagne, and when I dropped into their website, I discovered that their live jazz house band is The Joe Policastro Trio! Who gnu? (Plenty of people knew, just not me. Nor did I know that Pops for Champagne had moved to State Street.

I wish a great time to all of you, too.While I wait for the gathering, I am 1) remembering Baklava for Breakfast, which could happen again, given the arrival of Mid-East Pastry this week (thank you, Basel!) and 2) tallying up the year:I read 80 books, all noted in my yellow book journal that looks like the socks in Baklava for Breakfast. These included novels, books of poetry, short story and essay collections, and nonfiction.Far behind in the 100 Rejections project, I sent out 26 submissions, had 8 acceptances or publications so far, 15 rejections, and 3 2017 submissions pending. (I think there are some pending from previous years, too, but I did not open all the folders....) I don't mind the rejections, as there are many reasons for that, but I do mind never hearing a response from some contests and journals. Sigh...  But that's a small peeve. And I prefer joy! 26 is far from 100 submissions, so I am vaguely peeved with me. Likewise, I forgive myself and go for the glee of the season instead.

Vance, a bestselling memoir I borrowed this summer and finally read this fall, in order to return it, reducing my stack of borrowed books. It helped me understand \"hillbilly\" thinking, and I wouldn't use that term except that Vance does, boldly, to identify the culture he grew up in. In fact, the way Vance talks about financial decisions in his community of origin ties right in with the behavioral economics I have been learning about, summarized here, in the press release related to the 2017 Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences, awarded to Richard H. Thaler of the University of Chicago. We don't always do what's best for us in the bigger picture, or what's rational, and Thaler has helped economists see and accept that psychology plays a big part in financial decisions, which affects the larger economy in often unpredictable ways...Right now I am reading Paterno, by Joe Posnanski, about Joe Paterno, beloved and hated longtime football coach at Penn State in State College, PA, known as \"Happy Valley\" until that nickname didn't seem to describe a community wracked and ruined by the Jerry Sandusky sex scandal, which caused the ouster, too, of Coach Paterno. I started toward the end of the book, to gain insight on that aspect of Paterno's career, and now I have started over at the beginning, interested in learning more about him and about football and coaching styles. This is all part of my research for directing For the Loyal this winter, a play Lee Blessing wrote in response to the Sandusky situation at Penn State. In a way, the play is indeed \"for the loyal,\" so they can consider how their loyalty affects everyone else; it is also for everyone else, so we can ask ourselves, \"What should be done? What should we do? What can be done? What is the right thing to do?\" Looking back, Paterno wished he had done more. Paterno presents us with the dilemma, as did the press at the time, of legal responsibility versus moral responsibility. What should we do?!"},

It makes me so sad. One of the latest stories is in The New Yorker, by Ronan Farrow, about Annabella Sciorra and Daryl Hannah, Rosie Perez and more, actors I admire for their talent, work, and bravery. Maybe you, too, have chosen to speak out or to remain silent. Maybe you, too, have sought solace and advice from friends who could or couldn't give it. Imagine the horror and stress of the incidents themselves, and the ongoing stress of whether to speak out or not. Imagine all the factors and circumstances.I am home today, doing such imagining and empathizing. I am not doing some other things because this, for the time being, takes precedence. Honoring these women by taking the time to think about them, by paying attention to what they are saying. Since I have worked as an actor, I know how hard that is, acting--the work itself, the artistic endeavor--and how hard getting the next job can be. Think what they were up against at all times as they proceeded in big time careers with all the forces and powers and even well-meaning people pressing them not to speak or ignoring them when they did. (My own acting career was \"small time\" but even I ran into shocking crap, and still do.) (And the literary world is not spared this crap, either.)

{"title": "Me, Too", "date": "Monday, October 23, 2017", "text": "Yesterday I asked myhusband if he was aware of the huge “Me, too” phenomenon on Facebook. He wasn’t(and he is on Facebook). “4.7 millionpeople,” I told him, “reported that they had been sexually harassed, assaulted,or abused, and the real count is probably twice that.” Or three times. The “official”count is probably even bigger now. I told him briefly why Ididn’t want to post a “Me, too” status on Facebook—I hated watching all thefights that ensued in people’s comments, I hated watching people climb up on allthe podiums and bandwagons; I hated seeing people I like and admire say stupidthings (even though I have said stupid things and step up on podiums andbandwagons, too)—but how I did share a short video my niece had shared, showingTarana Burke, who started the “Me Too” movement ten years ago…and how sad andmoving and inspiring that was. Burke spoke with her daughter, who can, alas,say, “Me, too.”*(And because I am not onTwitter, I knew about Tarana Burke as founder of the movement before I knewthat Alyssa Milano had encouraged a “me too” reply to a tweet and a follow-upTwitter boycott, etc., all laid out here in a New York Times article. I am glad that Burke and Milano are nowfriendly collaborators in raising awareness. *I learned in the articlethat Burke started the movement in part because she “couldn’t even say ‘me too’”to a very young victim of sexual abuse. Burke’s movement is all about empathy, specifically“empowerment through empathy,” and she wanted to put people who had sufferedtogether with others who could say, “Me, too.”** Burke has also started anot-for-profit organization called Just Be Inc focused on wellness andwholeness.) **I am the one adding the annoyingcomma, though.Today I saw the piece byJenny Listman in Medium, about thetime Elie Wiesel “grabbed [her] ass”—more sad news, beautifully written, makingthe issues (and the ironies) very, very clear.

{"title": "A Body of Work", "date": "Sunday, October 22, 2017", "text": "Ever since Kazuo Ishiguro won the Nobel Prize in Literature, I have been reading his work, checking out his books from the library. I started with When We Were Orphans and then went on to The Buried Giant, the most recent, which takes place in a sort of Beowulfian/post-King Arthur world where the Britons have been in conflict with the Saxons, until they forgot about it. But what will awaken their memories?! It was a slow-moving, page-turner of a book--how do those two things go so well together? that is the mystery of Ishiguro, perhaps!--with a final moment worth waiting for. A book about memory, vengeance, war, and idealism, it made me very sad.Fantasy is OK, but, frankly, I prefer realism...or, as in the case of The Unconsoled, surrealism, which is like a very long, pretty bad dream, but, as before, I was gripped and could not stop turning the pages. This one struck me as human and true and heart breaking. A guy comes to town to play the piano--he is a famous musician--and gets wrapped up in the lives of the townspeople, or as wrapped up as he can, given his own character, which resembles that of certain other characters in the novel. This one, too, made me very sad.I wrote down many sentences. Here, the main character is recalling a moment when a classmate sought to console him in the past: \"For one thing, even in my state of self-pity, I had been able to recognize the remarkable generosity he was displaying, and had felt a profound gratitude. It was also at that moment I had first realized, with a distinct chill, that there was another side to the school golden boy--some deeply vulnerable dimension that would ensure he would never live up to the expectations that had been placed on him.\" This is a moment of great insight into the other person's character, without the narrator 1) recognizing in himself the same thing going on and 2) being able to reciprocate in empathy, in the past or in the present. See the sadness?Here, too, speaking to a child (who seems to vary in age), the narrator speaks wisely of regret without (quite) seeing in himself the same vulnerability to it: \"And you see, once you miss it [your big chance], there's no going back, it would be too late. It won't matter how hard I travel afterwards, it won't matter, it would be too late, and all these years I've spent would have been for nothing. I've seen it happen to other people, Boris. They spend year after year travelling and they start to get tired, perhaps a little lazy. But that's often just when it comes along. And they miss it. And, you know, they regret it for the rest of their lives. They get bitter and sad. By the time they die, they've become broken people.\"While it's not the kind of plot to which you attach the word the word \"spoiler,\" I don't want to say too much about Miss Collins and her speech near the end of the novel, but I will quote her on this: \"Me, the music, we're neither of us anything more to you than mistresses you seek consolation from.\" This is crucial since the title is The Unconsoled, and we do seem to be in the land of the unconsoled throughout the novel. In it, people do offer each other various consolations--words, food, drink, hospitality, advice, practice rooms....  Ah, but as one character puts it, \"I had certain plans then, such as you do when you are young, when you don't realize there's a shell built around you, a hard shell so you can't--get--out!\""},

Meanwhile, I am reading--and about to finish--When We Were Orphans by Kazuo Ishiguro, who just won the Nobel Prize in Literature. Here is a New Yorker piece on him that refers to \"the itch of wanting to know\" which is what I experience when reading Ishiguro. I had read Never Let Me Go and seen the movie of The Remains of the Day, which I also need now to read, or to read again...and some shorter pieces. There is a mastery in this writing.

I guess I was too busy with other things, or it could be a general winding down. (I hope not.)My poetry tally is shamefully low; perhaps I will tally before I go... But on October 1, two new issues came out with poems of mine in them:Rogue Agent with \"We Ruined Our Teeth\"andthe museum of americana with \"Sunset with No Motel in Sight\" and \"The Red Car\"Palindromish coincidence: Rogue Agent is issue #31 and the museum of americana is issue #13. (See creepy coincidii from yesterday here.)Red herringish coincidence re: images. It is not really a No Vacancy problem but instead a \"no motel in sight\" problem, as that poem states in its title. And while aspects of each poem may be true or autobiographical,1. We might not have been looking for a motel at all.2. \"The Red Car\" is based on a dream and a myth.3. Our teeth are not now constellations.But it is true that the song \"Drive\" by The Cars makes me cry. The line, \"Who's gonna drive you home...tonight?\" I don't know why, really.

{"title": "Magic for Beginners", "date": "Saturday, October 7, 2017", "text": "I am creeped out. What are the odds that I would read two books in a row that contain a character named Ransom? Granted, in one, The Bostonians, by Henry James, Basil Ransom, is a major character, and, in the other, Aiding and Abetting, by Muriel Spark, Roy Ransom, a detective, is merely a mentioned character. (And his name might have been \"Ranson,\" as it was printed the second time he was mentioned, though that might have been a typo. Or was it an intentional mistake, as he was mentioned in a character's notes, to lend verisimilitude. But does that happen? I found it weird.) And I did not read this particular edition of The Bostonians, but I liked this particular couple. They look ghostly or like they are made out of Hollywood ectoplasm, adding to the creepiness of it all. I read instead an edition with a good introduction by A.S. Byatt and excellent footnotes at the back, so I read with two bookmarks, to keep track of them.The Bostonians is creepy as Ransom, a Southerner, not too long after the Civil War, is sort of stalking a feminist from the North (Boston)--or rather a lovely young woman with a talent for public speaking, who can be used by the feminist movement of the time. It was particularly creepy reading it in our times, in the context of the current prolonged backlash against feminism and the resurgence of Confederate flags and related controversies. And now I do want to see the movie with Christopher Reeve as Ransom, to ponder his charm, though I read the book casting the remake in my head, and Ransom was played by Adam Driver. Henry James describes Adam Driver's long, thrown-back hair, I kid you not. Creepy.It is October, which adds to the creepiness. Now I am reading Magic for Beginners, a bunch of surreal short stories by Kelly Link. I just finished the story with many rabbits in the yard, so, if you have read it, you know why I am creeped out. Not only by the story, but also because my yard is full of rabbits, too, as we don't spray lawn poison, and I leave plenty of things in the yard for animals, birds, squirrels, earthworms, and insects to eat all year long. I mean seed heads, vegetable compost, and bread crusts.And up this month at Escape Into Life is my review of Travel Notes from the River Styx, a book of poems by Susanna Lang, that is sort of a dreamy road trip in the Underworld. You can read it here if you want more creepiness! Meanwhile, the annual Evergreen Cemetery Walk continues in Bloomington, Illinois. I wrote a couple of the scripts for it, and the actors are doing a great job. The unifying theme this year is World War I, as this is the centennial of the USA's involvement in that sad, sad war. The ghosts of soldiers, Red Cross nurses, and hard-working, generous people of our community do walk again...."},

I always learn a lot from actor biographies, sometimes more than I ever wanted or needed to know, but I love finding ways to connect to other human beans. Like Mary Martin, I get good ideas in the shower, and, also like her, I don't like to see myself on camera or videotape. Here, on p. 316, the two came together: \"So I said to myself one day in the shower--that's where I get all my famous ideas, like washing that man right outta my hair--I never saw myself on stage, so there really is no need for me to see myself now, or I might never go back on television.\" She was a hit on live television, as Peter Pan, and on various taped TV specials, but people loved her dearly onstage, alive and natural, full of energy, in that ephemeral art that is theatre. I think I hate seeing myself (taped live) from my basic shyness and introversion, and I sort of don't want to know how I do what I do. I don't want to be any more self-consciousness than I already am! A great thing about live theatre is to disappear into the moment that is shared--with other actors and with the audience and in & with the world imagined and created by the playwright first and then interpreted by theatre artists. Now, back to Siri Hustvedt, whose fiction and essays I have been reading all summer. Also reading & reviewing poetry for EIL, most recently Whirlwind @ Lesbos, by Risa Denenberg."},

Anything is Possible, by Elizabeth Strout, is another set of interconnected stories (like Olive Kitteridge)--though the New York Times calls it a novel (but the library calls it short stories)--and the book explores the characters back in Amgash, Illinois, Lucy Barton's hometown.But I connected in a special way when I got to the story \"Snow-Blind,\" with its Annie Appleby character, an actress.\"She had recently, though, had fantasies of 'going normal.' Having a house and a husband and children and a garden. The quietness of all that. But what would she do with all the feelings that streamed down her like small rivers? It was not the sound of applause Annie liked--in fact, she often barely heard it--it was the moment onstage when she knew she had left the world and fully joined another. Not unlike the feelings of ecstasy she'd had in the woods as a child.\"I didn't know it was called \"going normal,\" but I did this, and not just in fantasy, leaving the Chicago stage to marry, raise kids, and have a patch of garden in our backyard and then actually going to Normal, Illinois to let the kids grow all the way up near a set of grandparents. (Now they live and work in Chicago, and one is headed to new adventures in California very soon. I think we did OK.)Now I am rehearsing a play again and revisiting the artistic dilemmas connected with that. I don't do it for the applause, that's for sure! (Sometimes I get sad or annoyed that people think all actors need applause and attention and ego stroking, but then I let that go, because I am older now and do not cling to my annoyances so much.) I do love entering the new world, the story of play! I love the immersion in the circumstances imagined by the playwright, even the ridiculous circumstances of The Importance of Being Earnest, by Oscar Wilde! We had a run-through last night, so we know we are not yet fully immersed, but we will be! That's what rehearsals are for.And side by side with this imagined life is the ecstasy of my real life, my own backyard with its rabbits and chipmunks and squirrels and wrens and cardinals and occasional hawks, its cone flowers and balsam and Rose of Sharon, and its great night sky."},
{"title": "Stay Awake", "date": "Thursday, August 17, 2017", "text": "Today I return to my report on my summer reading, here Stay Awake, a book of short stories by Dan Chaon. But I have to say I am preoccupied by current events, heartsick and sad about the violence in Virginia and now in Spain. Though perpetrated by different people, for different surface reasons, it seems to come from the same scared, angry place--little men, probably off balance, seeking meaning or purpose in the only way they can find, by hurting or killing others to make their lonely, alone, senseless \"statement.\" The violence here in my own country does mean that we, its citizens and residents, must stay awake! Realize how deep goes the anger and hatred and displacement and lack of logic or empathy on the part of those doing the violence. They don't really know what they are doing, do they? If they did, they'd have to stop. They act in a terrible ignorance of their relationship with others, with the rest of us.Dan Chaon's stories here are ghost stories. Or stories with a mystical or supernatural component or possibility. But all of them ring true at the psychological level, too, as just a state of mind, or a state of sleep, or a dreaming state....I did not know his wife had died of cancer. Now I want to read her stories, too. Here is his loving account of her."},

Well, while in Michigan, though nowhere near Kalamazoo, Bonnie Jo Campbell's hometown, I read Mothers, Tell Your Daughters, a good book of short stories about strong, hard-working, not always entirely admirable women, but you can't help admire them, anyway, looking closely at their circumstances. I read like a daughter wanting to know everything. There were serious, long, and tender stories, short shorts, and a funny one called \"My Dog Roscoe,\" about a woman who is convinced that a lost dog she adopts is her dead ex-lover reincarnated. Even that one gets poignant* by the end, all the more poignant for me, as I once knew a dog named Roscoe. In Michigan.*New York Times reviewer agrees with me on the poignancy!"},

We swam in pool and lake, some of us in inflatable kayaks. We read books (me), played golf and volleyball (others), did yoga (my sister), played games, and had great conversations. A time of togetherness. Here is a picture of most of us, this particular year. My son, who took the picture, is also in it, thanks to a timer. My sister's son, who was with us most of the week, is not in it, thanks to his life in the Nashville Ballet.It has turned to August. How quickly summer slips by...In Michigan one morning after a big rainstorm, there were tiny frogs in the pool. I swam with them, others fished them out. Back in Normal, during Early Bird Lap Swim, we early birds swam with a big frog, who stayed in two lanes, mainly, then jumped on deck, then escaped a big white bucket wielded by the lifeguard, then didn't. She carried him safely away from the chlorine pool.Since my return, I have been attending rehearsals for The Importance of Being Earnest, by Oscar Wilde, going up at Heartland Theatre in September. I am Lady Bracknell, no doubt closer to the Dame Judi Dench type than the Dame Edith Evans type, or the David Suchet type. (She has often been played by a man.) When I saw the costume renderings, I noticed the pearl-drop earrings and realized I have the exact pair, thanks to my mother-in-law.Lady Bracknell is a bit of a toad."},

A second definition at Urban Dictionary is the one I intended, when younger people, such as siblings, hand their clothing up to older siblings. In my case, I wanted to mention that I am now wearing some of my daughter's clothes, since she has moved away and left a bunch of things in the closet and in various bags I have not yet given away. I found this strapless dress in the closet and wore it to the Sugar Creek Arts Festival yesterday and found a picture of myself in it on Facebook. That's my husband and me looking at art. (I got some.)The other day I wore a lacy yellow top over another yellow top, the exact same yellow, a perfect find in a bag of hand-me-ups. Hand Me Ups is also a thrift shop in Omaha and a consignment store in Anchorage. I am clearly unoriginal.I just relived the 1980s (and learned a lot about videogames) by reading Ready Player One by Ernest Cline.

Here's what's blooming: Prairie Blue Eyes (lavender lilies), big yellow daisies, purple coneflower, the last of the white anemone, the beginning of the white hosta, the end of the blue & purple spiderwort, and a jillion orange day lilies. I've eaten a few early raspberries. There's work to be done (and hedgehogs to be folded), but I thought I'd fill you in on my recent reading.I'm participating in the Adult Summer Reading program at the library, which asks us to read around in various genres. I'm reading a novel now, but I've already read my biography and nonfiction. I read The Lincolns: Portrait of a Marriage, by Daniel Mark Epstein, who also wrote the charming Lincoln and Whitman: Parallel Lives in Civil War Washington, about the near-miss, across-the-street relationship of the President and the Poet who loved him.I also read The Death of Expertise, by Tom Nichols, a 5-time Jeopardy champion, as it turns out! My mom will be impressed. (She'd also be impressed by India Cooper, another 5-time champion and an actor I knew in Chicago!!) In The Death of Expertise, Nichols lays out the sad situation in straightforward language and with a common sense approach that also reveals that he's en expert. He sees a great loss of critical thinking among people today, including the college-educated, in part because college has become a consumer product rather than a place to acquire knowledge and learn how to think. This goes side by side with contempt for intellectuals and the \"elite,\" which Nichols tracks for us in popular culture and politics. This book 1) made me sad 2) articulated what I have also observed in America today. Nichols warns that American democracy is in grave danger, reminding us that our democracy is a republic, one in which we elect representatives who should be, er, experts!Reading the book reminded me of the concept of getting better and better at something by doing it a lot, specifically for 10,000 hours. I realized I am old enough to have developed some expertise in more than one area. I have done 10,000 hours of acting (in a 10+ year \"career\") and more than 10,000 hours of writing & editing, not to mention reading. I hope I don't spending 10,000 hours making book hedgehogs.

Written in response to the Jerry Sandusky scandal at Penn State, For the Loyal is about a scandal that threatens a football program. Beartown is about a scandal that threatens a hockey program that means a lot to a small town in the forest. Both works keep asking us, \"What should we do? What is the right thing to do here?\" Backman's book is wonderful in how it keeps turning assumptions right around and opening up new ways of thinking about something and new possibilities of behavior.*I'll be doing other research, too, which has begun with the documentary Happy Valley, about the effect of the crimes and scandal on the community of State College, PA, known as \"Happy Valley\" before things got so unhappy there. It is a careful, compassionate, and devastating exploration--with hope in it.But this bit from the middle of Beartown, pertinent to its own plot, could apply to the state of things in the USA right now, where we seem to be headed for another Civil War, as uncivil as the last one.Fredrik Backman in Beartown:Hate can be a deeply stimulating emotion. The word becomes much easier to understand and much less terrifying if you divide everything and everyone into friends and enemies, we and they, good and evil. The easiest way to unite a group isn't through love, because love is hard. It makes demands. Hate is simple.So the first thing that happens in a conflict is that we choose a side, because that's easier than trying to hold two thoughts in our heads at the same time. The second thing that happens is that we seek out facts that confirm what we want to believe--comforting facts, ones that permit life to go on as normal. The third is that we dehumanize our enemy. There are many ways of doing that....This rings very true, and I'm watching it happen all around me. I'm sad about it. I keep expecting us all to grow up, but we linger in an easier immaturity, I fear, or in \"the inability to tolerate ambiguity,\" as my dad used to put it. I grew up being warned about this, but here it is, still.I do tolerate ambiguity. I'm an artist, a thinker, a reader, a witness to the complicated lives lived all around me. But I see people of hope and goodwill still choosing to oversimplify situations that are complicated, looking for easy solutions, wishing for good to defeat evil the way it happens in our fantasies, our myths, our hopes...and maybe forgetting that one side thinks it is good and the other evil, and vice versa, if we oversimplify. There are interesting, creative, reasonable solutions, but they take attention and effort, cooperation and compromise, and often do not \"permit life to go on as normal.\" Fortunately, I live in Normal.

I did find my envelope of tiny poems for your pocket yesterday, while cleaning up my office and listening to Lincoln in the Bardo, by George Saunders. I wrote about that listening experience over at Escape Into Life, in the EIL Blog, including a poem about Lincoln, which is too long and too online to stick in your pocket, but you can go there via this easy link, if you like!That poem was published in Feast: Poetry & Recipes for a Full Seating at Dinner (an anthology of food poems and, yes, recipes, published by Black Lawrence Press in 2015). It was included in the cocktail section, because Lincoln is toasting Robert Burns, and I also made up a cocktail, with help from the bartender at the Marriott, called the Lilacs in the Courtyard Cosmo. Walt Whitman's elegy to Lincoln is \"When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd,\" but \"courtyard\" is, here, alliterative and more likely--drinks in the hotel courtyard! In any case, both poem (Whitman's) and drink (mine) are blue. I'm rambling. (So you know it's me.)Then today the Food issue of Poetry East arrived! It's glorious. It is also set up as a full-course dinner, but a particular \"perfect meal,\" as chosen by chef Mary Jo McMillin, of Mary Jo's Cuisine (a restaurant in Oxford, Ohio) and Mary Jo's Kitchen (her blog), with recipes provided. Mary Jo is the widow of James Reiss, a poet, to whom this issue is dedicated. He has a wonderful poem in the same issue, a funny poem called \"Mary Had,\" with \"little lamb / hunks\" in it, and lamb is indeed the main course of the \"perfect meal.\" The perfect meal is perfectly photographed by the Poetry East editors, who apparently got to eat the perfect meal in February of this year! There is also gorgeous art about food all through the issue. You can get a copy here. If you read this issue, you will be hungry and yet satiated. And you will enjoy \"Fat Hamlet,\" which is about \"grief bacon,\" as in \"Kummerspeck--in German, excess weight gained from emotional overeating; literally 'grief bacon'\"My poem in this issue is \"Glazed,\" in the dessert section, about a honey-sweet day in April, previously published in Crab Creek Review and reprinted for the PE food anthology.

Some were novels, some short story collections, and several were nonfiction, including this wonderful memoir, Lab Girl.Here are some sentences I wrote down in my reading journal:\"Tiny but determined, I navigated the confusing and unstable path of being what you are while knowing it's more than people want to see.\"\"Science has taught me that everything is more complicated than we first assume, and that being able to derive happiness from discovery is a recipe for a beautiful life.\"I could stop there...but I can't.\"It has also convinced me that carefully writing everything down is the only real defense we have against forgetting something important that once was and is no more, including the spruce tree that should have outlived me but did not.\"This comforted and bolstered me so much because 1) I have kept a diary since I was 10 and 2) I'm now keeping this reading journal.\"There is nothing in the world more perfect than a slide rule.\" We have one as a prop in the play!And, to reveal myself as I record what I value: \"A vine becomes whatever it needs to be and does whatever it must to make real its fabulous pretensions.\"I love that. I feel a strange affinity to vines. \"Vines are not sinister; they are just hopelessly ambitious. They are the hardest-working plants on Earth.\" I'll leave you thinking about that!"},

At noon I was silent, and during a part of the march, I \"marched\" a 2-mile trek on the local hiking trail, as it is 60 degrees and sunny here in globally warmed central Illinois today, smiling at my fellows humans and dogs. So many friends and strangers were marching in so many cities. Thank you all. And thank you, Shepard Fairey, for these peaceful, hopeful protest posters. And now I'm off to see Hidden Figures, another form of peaceful protest. (I think Hollywood listened.)"},
{"title": "Public Library", "date": "Saturday, January 14, 2017", "text": "I've been reading the short stories and the italicized interstices of Public Library and Other Stories, by Ali Smith. She's the delightfully random writer of The Accidental, about a woman who walks into a house. Ali Smith is in love with words, books, libraries, coincidence, connection, and the imagination. Between the stories, she tells us about the assault on libraries in the United Kingdom, and here is a BBC News article with the current statistics on that. Many libraries were closed, many people lost their jobs (and were replaced by volunteers) and many people lamented the loss of libraries they loved.In the context of Brexit and post-truth America, I was struck by what writer Sophie Mayer told Smith: \"I believe libraries are essential for informed and participatory democracy, and that there is therefore an ideological war on them via cuts and closures, depriving individuals and communities of their right to knowledge and becoming on their own terms.\" This coincides right now with the fears and worries about the end of democracy in America due to the lack of an informed citizenry.Smith also includes comments by Richard Popple that coincide with our current concerns for our most vulnerable populations here in the USA. Popple says, \"Libraries are, at heart, helpful and kind providers. It is hard for those who perhaps don't feel the need to visit their local libraries to understand what a vital service they provide for communities and individuals who do--and those who do are often the most vulnerable.\" I feel so lucky both communities in my twin-city home are talking about new libraries, and have already renovated and expanded to fit the changing times and needs, ever since I first used the library and since I first worked in one in my college summers. I hope we never head toward cuts like those in the UK, but these days any bad thing seems possible.Back to Sophie Mayer, whose list of weapons used by Buffy the Vampire Slayer includes a library card. \"Libraries save the world, a lot, but outside the narrative mode of heroism: though contemplative action, anonymously and collectively. For me, the public library is the ideal model of society, the best possible shared space, a community of consent....\" I love that, \"a community of consent\" as a truly participatory democracy. And isn't there a Librarian Superhero yet?! Why, yes. Batgirl! Barbara Gordon was a librarian. And then there's Lucy Superhero of Ask a Librarian dot org."},

Pistachio baklava from Mid-East Pastry Delight! By chance, that was the day a poet friend asked on Facebook what was the last thing you ate, as that would be the name of your new dog. My new imaginary dog is named Baklava!!The holidays were a lovely, warm, game-playing, yummy-eating time for family wamily! Yay! Followed (or accompanied) by bitter cold and resumed terror in the world and in American politics. Sigh...Sometimes I escaped, as I am wont to do, by reading. I read a bunch of nonfiction and a bunch of fiction, and in 2017 I have started a hard-copy reading log in a notebook that looks like a giant yellow library card. (I have socks to match.)A fascinating coincidence: Harriet Jacobs. I read about her in Trainwreck, by Sady Doyle, and it would seem to me that she is a model for Cora in The Underground Railroad by Colson Whitehead! They both hid in an attic, as did Anne Frank.Another coincidence: Rosalind Franklin. I love her because I love the double helix of DNA, and she was an x-ray photographer whose work helped establish the shape and structure of DNA. This winter I'll be working as assistant director on the play Photograph 51 by Anna Ziegler, about the pertinent photograph and the scientist herself, and I am currently reading Hark! A Vagrant, by Kate Beaton, which contains this fabulous cartoon about Rosalind Franklin that sort of encapsulates the play. (Likewise, thanks to Kate Beaton, I don't need to watch the rest of The Borgias television series. But do come see the play Photograph 51 at Heartland Theatre, in April. It is very well written and Franklin's character is a delight. I hope Ziegler and Beaton have talked!) I had already read Step Aside, Pops, another set of Beaton history, literature, & mythology cartoons, because it was available first at the library. And I devoured Swing Time, by Zadie Smith, a favorite writer of mine.Once I emerge from reading hibernation, I'll be working on behalf of local politics as a Democratic precinct committeeman (person). Because that was one thing I could do after the horror, the horror of the recent election.... And here is my imaginary dog, Baklava."},
{"title": "Tally Ho", "date": "Monday, December 12, 2016", "text": "While some people are still counting votes, I am tallying up my rejections for the year. I have not sent out very many submissions this year, compared to some other recent years, but an acceptance today was a spur to do the count. So, in 2016 I sent out 27 packets, got 9 acceptances (of 12 actual poems, including 2 reprints in anthologies) and 14 rejections. It never quite adds up, due to carryover from past years. I have 11 pending submissions in the 2016 file, and some carryover all the way back to 2014, but I am counting those (in my mind) as rejections even though I never actually heard back from three publications. (I won't be sending to those 3 again.) It is much easier to tally things up when I send out fewer submissions, but much harder to get 100 rejections!Meanwhile, I have begun sending out this year's Christmas cards and letters, a gradual process, and keeping track of that, too. I love to get actual mail, and I hope some other people do, too, and I am using a combination of leftover Peanuts Christmas stamps from last year and the beautiful Fund the Fight Find a Cure breast cancer research stamps I buy regularly in honor of my cousin Margie. When I run out of those, I have flower stamps and Wonder Woman stamps. I just have to remember to leave them out for the mail carrier or drop them in the mailbox in town. My brain remains both scattered and full these days, ticking things off and being ticked off since November 8. Sigh....Not to be a tally ho, but I've also started tallying up my annual expenses, etc., preparing for tax time. It's been a big year for donations, thanks to the election, as that was one small thing I could do in response, over and over again, donate to worthy and beleaguered causes. Double sigh...Plus, I am peeling stickers off an Advent calendar just for fun. (No chocolate is harmed in this harmless, chocolateless, alas, activity.)"},
{"title": "The Sixth Extinction", "date": "Monday, December 5, 2016", "text": "This gave me pause: \"If you want to think about why humans are so dangerous to other species, you can picture a poacher in Africa carrying an AK-47 or a logger in the Amazon gripping an ax, or, better still, you can picture yourself, holding a book on your lap.\" Wait, what? I'm as dangerous as those other guys? Yes, according to Elizabeth Kolbert in The Sixth Extinction. Kolbert identifies this period of species endangerment and extinctions--there have been five previous extinctions--as the one caused by humans. One of the most famous extinctions was caused by the meteor that hit the earth and killed the dinosaurs. That was an outside force; the other extinctions have had internal causes associated with climate, weather, and geological change.So I did picture myself with a book in my lap, hers! She and the scientists and naturalists she interviewed and went out into the field with agree that humans are trouble for the earth, basically starting with the industrial age but also because of our ability to use signs, symbols, language. \"As soon as humans started using signs and symbols to represent the natural world, they pushed beyond the limits of that world.\" She quotes Michael Benton, a paleontologist,* as saying, \"In many ways human language is like the genetic code. Information is stored and transmitted, with modifications, down the generations. Communication holds societies together and allows humans to escape evolution.\" That is, evolution, like our democracy, has some natural checks and balances. We've thrown them out of whack.And it appears we've thrown our democracy out of whack, too. I couldn't help but make the political comparison when I got to this paragraph in The Sixth Extinction:\"The one feature these disparate events [the previous extinctions] have in common is change, and, to be more specific, rate of change. When the world changes faster than species can adapt, many fall out. This is the case whether the agent drops from the sky in a fiery streak or drives to work in a Honda. To argue that the current extinction event could be averted if people just cared more and were willing to make sacrifices is not wrong, exactly; still, it misses the point. It doesn't matter whether people care or don't care. What matters is that people change the world.\"Kolbert means that, no matter what we do, we do change the world. If we step outside of our place in nature, or in evolution, we can (and did) screw things up, endangering many species, including ourselves. What I see in the current political context is that some people could not handle the rapid rate of change and feared extinction of the status quo, an old way of life, with them at the top. They feared there weren't enough resources if we shared them--power, freedoms, security, jobs, human rights. Alas! I did love this book, which was published in 2014, from the woolly mammoths to the giant rats that may inherit the earth. In 2016, it is even more frightening to consider.***Now, the weirdness of memory: I kept thinking I had seen Elizabeth Kolbert on the Colbert Report talking about her book, and that she was Stephen Colbert's sister. But why, then, did she spell her last name with a \"K\"? Evidently, I had remembered seeing her, as Wikipedia reminds me, on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, way back in 2014. The Elizabeth Colbert I was remembering as Stephen's sister with the one from Clemson, who ran for office in South Carolina, way back in 2013, Elizabeth Colbert-Busch. My brain is losing some cells and twisting the other ones together.** Sigh....What matters now is that people change the world.*like Ross, from Friends**like the double helix***like a giant orange rat"},

{"title": "The Edge of Forever", "date": "Wednesday, November 2, 2016", "text": "So, I was just telling you about reading Time Travel, by James Gleick, which mentioned Flatland: A Romance in Many Dimensions, by Edwin Abbott, published in 1884. Abbott was dealing with the fourth dimension, and our difficulty getting our heads around that new idea, by imagining a two-dimensional land where the inhabitants are trying to get their minds around the possibility of a third dimension. (Plus, it satirizes Victorian culture.) Abbott's narrator is a square named A. Square.Flatland has come back to us in various ways, including via Futurama and Big Bang Theory on tv, and also in an episode of Carl Sagan's television series, Cosmos, \"The Edge of Forever\" episode. But it came back to me almost immediately--that is, in the next book I am reading, which is This One is Mine, by Maria Semple, which I had to read after reading Today Will Be Different (which I had to read after reading Where'd You Go, Bernadette? Yes, I am, evidently, addicted to reading.) Little did I know that all three of Semple's novels sort of connect, in a Random Coinciday kind of way. (But not so random, as she is a bestselling author, who also used to write for Mad About You and Arrested Development--favorite shows in our house!--and she knows what she's doing!)Anyhoo, imagine my delight when, on page 70 of my paperback edition of This One is Mine, \"An image came to Sally, something she remembered from childhood. It was from the Carl Sagan series Cosmos, something called Flatland. Flatland was this two-dimensional world where everything was flat, even the Flatlanders who lived there. They could only perceive left and right, front and back, but no above or below. One day, a potato flew over from another dimension--really, Carl Sagan had said it was a potato--and this potato looked down and said, 'Hello.'\"OK, Sally goes on to perceive love in an altogether new way, thanks to Flatland, and I went on to seek out Flatland and Cosmos from the library! Oddly, I could only find the audiobook of Flatland, so that's a fun and unusual experience. When the narrator says, \"In Figure 1, etc.\" I know there must be illustrations, but I can rather easily imagine them. I have not come yet to the potato, nor to \"The Edge of Forever,\" but I have seen a still from the series in which Carl Sagan is holding an apple over a two-dimensional gameboard-like depiction of what might be Flatland, so...a pomme if not a pomme de terre. (Oh, my origami brain!) If I ever get there, to the Edge of Forever, and back, I'll let you know. But, for now, my destination is not even Flatland but Cleveland, via televisonland, and the World Series. May the best team win!"},
{"title": "Time Travel", "date": "Sunday, October 30, 2016", "text": "I am reading Time Travel, by James Gleick, so my brain is looping around in time. Many delights here, and Gleick is so clear, as he was in explaining chaos theory via Chaos, back in 1987. I will pause long enough in loop to mention two of the delights:1) Gleick describes a short film called La jetee and I'm recognizing the plot of 12 Monkeys, a film I watch over and over when the mood overtakes me. Then I'm thinking I remember seeing a credit to La jetee in 12 Monkeys, then doubting my memory (am I creating that memory?!) and then Wikipedia to the rescue, and also IMDb!! Indeed. (And now I will have to watch 12 Monkeys all over again!)2) On page 182 of Time Travel, I'm reading about the Golden Record, sent off in Voyagers 1 and 2, \"a twelve-inch disk engraved with analog data via the technology, now obsolete, known as 'phonograph' (1877-ca. 1987).\" Inner giggles at the way Gleick describes the obsolete phonograph record, which he and I are old enough to remember, and because I just read all about the Golden Record, in great detail, in The Voyager Record, by Anthony Michael Morena, which I reviewed for Escape Into Life. (Morena might not be old enough to remember the phonograph, but the records and record players are still around, relics of time travel...!)Goofy little confession: The Golden Record part comes before the La jetee part of Time Travel, so I have reversed chronology here. Tee hee. People who like science fiction will enjoy this book, with its references to Isaac Asimov, Ray Bradbury, Robert Heinlein, Philip K. Dick, and E. Nesbit, among others. And I loved learning, via footnote, that James Gleick's mother, Beth Gleick, wrote a children's book on time, called Time is When."},

The other day, during a performance, I caught a fainting student, so maybe I have earned the nickname! I get to wear a silvery gray 1920s-style dress as well as low heels while performing 12 to 15 times a day, so that might earn me a halo, too. But when I come home to rest and recover, I am still reading! And still reading memoirs.I am in love with Patricia Hampl and must now seek out her poetry, after reading The Florist's Daughter. Her dad was a florist in St. Paul, Minnesota. Here is a random coincidence. Jennie Thompson had a kind of \"flower ministry,\" using a particular extra donation to her charitable organization (a day nursery and settlement house) to take flowers to mothers whose children had died.I found an excerpt from another of Hampl's memoirs in Writing Women's Lives, edited by Susan Cahill, a book I'd heard about for years but finally got hold of at the library! That is truly wonderful. And I read Graham Greene's memoir, A Sort of Life. We discussed Sunny's Nights, by Tim Sultan, this summer at my book group, sort of a memoir of a bar, like The Tender Bar, by J.R. Moehringer, which we'd enjoyed in a previous year.

Alas, I think my parents gave me some of thosememoirs to try to steer me gently away from a life in the theatre, but I wasstubborn, and/or to let me know what I was getting myself into.Onething I’ve read that is mentioned but noton Karr’s list, is a memoir she refers to as basically a bunch of lies, Pentimento, by Lillian Hellman. Karrprefers Mary McCarthy. I have read McCarthy’s novel, The Group, but must now read Memoriesof a Catholic Girlhood, on Karr’s recommendation, and, fittingly, afterMerton.

I amsure somebody told me about this, because when I saw it there on the shelf, Iknew I had to have it. I thought it was someone from the library’s Book Talkgroup, but…no? Or someone from my monthly Book Club? Suzie? Or my mom, whowould have read it early on in The NewYorker? I don’t know, but it is lovely.Moreon memoir later, no doubt……Butfor now, this coincidence. On page 28 of Roz Chast’s memoir of taking care ofher parents, she provides a cartoon of her dad attempting to make toast. “Now,let’s see… You put the bread into one of these compartments… How do you knowwhich one? Do you put the bread in first?? Or do you press this little leverdown first???”InRosenblatt’s book, making toast is the one thing he does know how to do. (My heart is still breaking for him.)Chastcontinues about her dad’s daily ineptitude (hehas his reasons!): “He was bad at opening packages, like cookies or cereal.You could tell which ones he’d tried to open, because they were always torn insome strange way, as if a raccoon tried to get into them.”  Believeme, I identify.

{"title": "The Castle Cross The Magnet Carter", "date": "Tuesday, August 23, 2016", "text": "What a good book! I wouldn't be surprised if this one wins the Pulitzer Prize in 2017 (but I don't know much about the timing/nominating process for that). Though it starts in the 1940s, it is a book for our times, showing us what happened in the United States from then right up to now(ish), now when the violence of race conflict that had gone underground has re-emerged. The Castle Cross The Magnet Carter is a book about American social and political history, race conflict, civil rights, labor rights, deaf culture, gay culture, and being human. Written by a woman playwright, Kia Corthron, its central characters are two sets of brothers--one set black, one set white. We see them in the circumstances of their families and the changing culture of America after World War II and through the violent civil rights era to the moment of now. We need to read it now, so we don't ever let some of what happened here (in this book and in this country) ever happen again.This is a challenging read, with many characters and incidents to keep track of. A wonderful thing about its narrative voices (in chapters from various perspectives) is that it reads/looks the ways it sounds, like speech. Black and white speech from the American South and Midwest, moving north and west and east, through the years, though schooling, and through the education that is life. And this is all the more remarkable because some of the characters speak with their hands! I learned that \"the sign language\" was called just that before getting \"standardized\" into American Sign Language, which was sort of white American sign language. The title resonates beautifully throughout--coming from the Magna Carta, the Great Charter of our political liberties and basic rights, as it is heard by a particular young boy: \"I like that! I like the Magnet Carter!\" Another marvelous thing is that in the immersion into characters I cared about, I 1) became them 2) did not know sometimes whether I was white or black (but then, suddenly, I did) and 3) came to understand how terrible, terrible, difficult things can happen and how people can survive them, or not.Visit the book via the publisher, Seven Stories Press, here, where you can see/hear Corthron read from her work!

Two sentences have arrested me so far. \"My grandmother assumed my loyalty, and this, surely, is the reason she got it.\" Yes, I am loyal to those who assume my loyalty, but I guess I've learned that it doesn't go both ways, alas.

It certainly contains skills on what will keep us alive in the zombie apocalypse.But my summer reading also includes a lot of poetry, and I am catching up on my poetry reviewing over at Escape Into Life.Today there's a review of Kristin LaTour's wonderful book, What Will Keep Us Alive (Sundress Publications, 2015). I have a rabbit like that in my own back yard. (Minus the carrot candle.) That fabulous art is called Night Watch by Maggie Taylor.More gushing: Letters to Colin Firth, by Katie Riegel, also a Sundress book!"},
{"title": "Eligible Cheese", "date": "Wednesday, July 27, 2016", "text": "I am reading Eligible, by Curtis Sittenfeld, and it is indeed hilarious, as everyone has said. On page 88, I found Lydia saying, \"The casomorphins in cheese are as addictive as opium,\" which explains why I ate so much smoked gouda yesterday afternoon, right? And also set me on one of my crazy Internet searches for the Internet's version of the truth.I found this, from Yum Universe, which confirmed Lydia Bennet, who is totally CrossFit but also silly and uncensored in Eligible, and made me scared that I had addicted my babies to morphine by breastfeeding them.Science News undid my worries a bit, but made me want pizza.And the Huffington Post proclaimed that \"Eating Cheese Isn't Even a Little Bit Like Smoking Crack Cocaine\"---pause...well, I wouldn't know...---alongside the image of a woman bonding with the devil's disarticulated white tongue. Oh, wait, that's cheese.All of which makes it a Fat Tuesday in the blog, even though it's Wednesday. And probably you already knew all about the cheese thing as I am often late to the party. And probably brought cheese."},

So, clearly, this must be connected to the Russian hacking of the Democratic National Committee. Right? Probably I clicked on some Hillary thing, and her campaign is definitely sending me emails. Sigh...Actually, this Russian blog attention has happened over the past week, so I should have heeded earlier warnings, as reported by CNN. Only, I didn't get any. Should I have been sending money to Hillary's campaign? Sorry, I don't have any!Aside: Russia, you are hacking up the wrong tree here. Yes, I intend to vote for Hillary Clinton, but I have no actual power, except the power of a single vote, which, actually, is a lot. And I intend to use it. But please don't hack me. I don't want to be hacked. Feel free, though to read my blog, and to admire the Mashtroshka image posted by Fanghong at Wikipedia/Wikimedia. And my actual family wamily of living dolls!More info here, in the New York Times. Geez Louise, it's just like the Cold War. Only now it's the Clod War, featuring Putin and Trump.

My sympathies to those with branches down, or worse, around town. Happy for those of you with the rainbows.Meanwhile, I've posted a review--a sort of reading interaction--about global warming, climate change, extreme weather, and poetry over at Escape Into Life.

It is quite tall now, smells like a tomato plant, and has new yellow blossoms. My hope is for fruit. I thought I had planted a few flowers in there to share the pot, but I am happy to see (and smell) this tomato.Woe continues in our country (and all over the world). The weeping woman has become my continuing Facebook profile picture. I found this in the book I read over the past two days, My Name is Lucy Barton, by Elizabeth Strout, and I think it is good to keep in mind to keep us in check:I have said it before: It interests me how we find ways to feel superior to another person, another group of people. It happens everywhere, and all the time. Whatever we call it, I think it's the lowest part of who we are, this need to find someone else to put down.I think Elizabeth Strout is right here; her narrator, Lucy Barton, is right. It is \"the lowest part of who we are,\" and I am ashamed of any time I was this low or acted this way and ashamed on behalf of those who don't yet realize they are acting this way, and may never realize it. I have to keep my shame and throw off theirs, replacing it with compassion, if I can.Last night, we watched Zootopia, borrowed from the library. Little did we know how pertinent it would be. Hang on, little tomato."},

Sigh...I am sad about Baghdad and all the violence and suffering all over our world. Yesterday, I listened to a lovely talk about Ramadan by a woman who was shattered by the Pulse shootings, the event itself and its timing during a period of peace, compassion, atonement. Baghdad brings the same terrible irony to mind and was calculated to disrupt Ramadan.This holiday week and weekend I have posted two poetry reviews at Escape Into Life. One might be the remedy for the other. I hope that Mark Neely, of Dirty Bomb, might read Suicide Hotline Hold Music, by Jessy Randall, so he can cringe and laugh in equal measure."},

But, alas, today I was out there early with my scythe, whacking at certain tall grasses and plantains that are out of control. Then with my little garden chair, clippers, and gloves, doing some edging and weeding.Even earlier, I watched a flock of bluejays take up the bread crumbs I'd laid out under the sweetgum tree. Then the resident squirrels enjoyed their chunks of apples. Now it's back to domestic chores and moments of rest, reading outdoors, currently Edna O'Brien, with whom I am in love.

{"title": "S is for Selfie", "date": "Tuesday, June 21, 2016", "text": "I learned from The Bloggess that today is National Selfie Day. Or rather, #NationalSelfieDay. (I suspect this is a Twitter thing.) I planned to illustrate this blog post with a selfie. If I could figure out how. I vaguely remembered taking some accidental selfies a few years ago when trying to document storm damage to our fence. Sigh... And I do OK on Instagram, taking pictures of my garden. So the plan was to go out and take a selfie beside the newest bloom on the Prairie Blue Eyes, since I have blue eyes (and it doesn't). I grabbed the new cap I bought today to walk home in, so I could show you that, too, my support of ISU Redbird Volleyball, and I do support Redbird Volleyball, but I bought the hat because I forgot to take my hat to work, since I don't wear a hat on the way to work, so my hair can dry,* only on the way back..., when the sun is in my eyes. Double sigh...*Swimming, followed by chlorine removal shampoo. (So my hair doesn't turn green.) (Wouldn't that be a fun selfie?)But when I picked up my phone, it was dead. So it's on the charger now, and I am going to tell you about H is for Hawk instead. This is a wonderful book, as everyone told me, by Helen Macdonald, and I loved remembering two specific things while reading it: 1) My own reading of The Once and Future King, by T.H. White, as Macdonald discusses that and other works by White as she a) mourns her father and b) trains her hawk 2) seeing a falcon in a hood on a falconer's wrist in childhood (sort of scary).Here are some things I loved in the book:1. \"Being a novice is safe. When you are learning how to do something, you do not have to worry about whether you are good at it. But when you have done something, have learned how to do it, you are not safe anymore. Being an expert opens you up to judgement.\" (p. 146, British spelling of \"judgement.\") Yes, indeed, judgment and expectations! Your own and others. Not to mention fear! Fear of judgment, fear of failure, and even fear of success, the self-consciousness that brings and how it can take the joy out of the activity you loved while beginning to learn it. Of course, this can be countered by the joys of mastery, confidence, and the ability to help/teach others, etc.2. \"Some part of me that was very small and old had known this, some part of me that didn't work according to the everyday rules of the world but with the logic of myths and dreams.\" (p. 220) This is the part of me that I trust and need to remember to trust, because whenever I don't remember to listen to little, old her 1) she stamps her foot 2) it's a disaster.3. Back to p. 146: \"'Need to excel in order to be loved,' White had written in his dream diary.\" Well, yes. That's exactly what drives my need to excel, to pursue excellence, in general. Plus, I keep a dream diary. What's not to love? Well, the \"unspoken coda,\" as Macdonald calls it: \"What happens if you excel at something and discover you are still unloved?\" Mmhm. Well, thus far, my answer is, \"Be more lovable.\" That little foot-stamping girl probably taught me that."},

It's that I've been busy, and swimming. And walking, and reading, and seeing people. And writing and editing to deadline.* And working.It's all good. I think five poems have come out since I last blogged, two in a print mag no doubt on its way to me, since I did not go up to Printer's Row Lit Fest this year to retrieve it, and three online:\"Harpoon\" in Sweet\"Crabapple Blooming\" in Poetry Porch\"Cows in the Rain\" in Redheaded StepchildYou can hear me read \"Harpoon,\" thanks to a tiny computer microphone my son gave me for Christmas! It's a very short poem that keeps flailing. I think Emily Dickinson might like my weird use of the word \"it\" in it. You'll want to see the red hair and peacock feathers on the home page of Redheaded Stepchild, a home for rejected poems.And my daughter, who is twenty something, wrote a Father's Day list for the Entertainment (etc.) section of  forever twenty somethings, a fun place to be forever twenty something.

Ack! I'm glad I went out in a blaze of gold-feathered glory with The Goldfinch, by Donna Tartt. It seems people either love this one or hate it, so I am among the lovers.One friend found it \"tedious.\" I never found it tedious, but I did bog down a bit in the parts about casual drug use. I guess that's tit for tat with the narrator talking about \"the boring part\" of It's a Wonderful Life, referring to the love scene and singing of \"Buffalo Gals.\" So we're even steven on that.But I loved being dropped in a Dickens-like or Dostoyevsky-like plot with plenty of characters to care about and cringe at, and I loved the philosophical moments, earned by both narrator and author.Here's one:Only here's what I really, really want someone to explain to me. What if one happens to be possessed of a heart that can't be trusted---?  What if the heart, for its own unfathomable reasons, leads one willfully and in a cloud of unspeakable radiance away from health, domesticity, civic responsibility and strong social connections and all the blandly-held common virtues and instead straight towards a beautiful flare of ruin, self-immolation, disaster? You hear the narrator's earnestness here, and also the terrible danger.If your deepest self is singing and coaxing you straight toward the bonfire, is it better to turn away?Stop your ears with wax? Ignore all the perverse glory your heart is screaming at you? Set yourself on the course that will lead you dutifully towards the norm, reasonable hours and regular medical check-ups, stable relationships and steady career advancement, the New York Times and brunch on Sunday, all with the promise of being somehow a better person? Or...is it better to throw yourself head first and laughing into the holy rage calling your name? I don't know the answer to these questions,* but 1) I think it's important to ask them and 2) I have known people who had to throw themselves into the bonfire. I don't want to judge them! I want to understand them, and this book helps me with that, and it also comforts me, as I am, while not as wild as this fellow, still not on that path-to-the-norm that leads in the opposite direction. I'm on a meandering path, as I've mentioned before, and I like \"the boring part\" of It's a Wonderful Life as well as the sometimes cut-from-late-night-television scene of the floor over the swimming pool coming apart, etc. It is a wonderful life, but much harder for people with PTSD or disaster or crappy circumstances. They don't get to fall laughing from a dance floor into a perfectly safe swimming pool when the earth opens up and swallows them.April is about to swallow me: poem a day for National Poetry Month, various events and writing deadlines, work, and the daily chores. Much as I'd like to be a slattern on Slattern Day, I'm doing the laundry....*Nor do I know why it's \"towards\" in one spot and \"toward\" in another. What is the difference between the two? (OK, fine if this the boring part of the blog post.)Thanks to Wikimedia and the public domain for Jimmy Stewart and Red Kimono on Roof by John Sloan.

On the trail, bright blue scilla is blooming, as it is, in a very pale blue, almost white, in my mom's yard, where it is gently spreading.Today I was out in my own yard raking--again!--the last of the fall leaves, which have been protecting one of the flowerbeds. I heard a wee bird with a big voice--it was a chickadee!But the goldfinches will be back for the catmint.

I read through chapter 33 of We Make the Road By Walking, by Brian McLaren, before a class on it this morning, and I finished Touchy Subjects, by Emma Donoghue before everybody arrived for the holiday, so I wouldn't be pulled away from conversation and games by the need to read a short story! I remember reading a review of this one when it first came out, and sort of shrugging internally, but after reading Room I wanted to try another book by her. I appreciated the variety/focus on relationships & babies and \"touchy subjects.\" Somehow this probably helped me stay away from touchy subjects at the gathering!And here are two bunnies touching each other and some bagpipes.Because bunnies.Also, my son left his car top, newly washed, in his bedroom.

Some mine, some borrowed--some borrowed from friends, some from the library.* They are stacked here and there in every room, because I might need a book at any time, right? So in addition to reading This Old Man, by Roger Angell, borrowed from my mom, I am reading The Shell Collector, by Anthony Doerr, borrowed from a friend. It is eerily beautiful. As I looked at the cover, I realized, I have all these shells. Where?I pictured them in a Betsy McCall's Travel Pac with a broken handle, where they used to be, but when I opened it up, I found little wooden trains and disassembled tracks from my son's toddlerhood. Then I pictured the shells in cookie tins, Mermaid and Riberhus Butter Cookie tins!** Yes!**also from my son's toddlerhood, gifts from his babysitter!This blog entry was going to be about something else altogether. I planned to quote Roger Angell, waxing patriotic about Memorial Day and Fourth of July parades. \"At ninety,\" he writes, \"I belong to the generation that was called into service almost en masse, sixteen million of us, in 1942 and 1943, and went off to war.\" Because his was an \"easy war\" by comparison with fellow soldiers who died or were wounded or damaged, he says, \"I've always felt a bit awkward with that Greatest Generation wreath that Tom Brokaw generously draped on us.\" Then he shares this insight: \"yes, mine is the Greatest Generation, but despite the compliment, the people who are really feeling good about that aren't us old guys, I notice, but everybody else, anybody who's younger. If we're great, then they're a little great, and America itself is great all over again.\" Perhaps you see where I am headed.Donald Trump recently came to town, and so did the Dump Trump and other peaceful protest groups, to voice their dismay with this candidate, mostly outside his rally. The few inside the rally were escorted peacefully out. I was struck by the fact that two of my acquaintances in town shared the same Dump Trump event post at Facebook, one in support of the protest, one criticizing the protest as being against free speech. Then a local newspaper columnist posted a funny picture about cheese, the Wallingford sign, that, to me, seemed to be anti-Trump in a good-natured way. So I \"Liked\" it, with the suddenly old-fashioned plain old thumbs-up Like button, not a fancy new emoticon, but so did the sincerely pro-Trump thumpers. The truth is I don't know how to read the world anymore! I guess this makes me This Old Woman. The kind of person who loves this sentence by Angell: \"Art waits for us to catch up, and never goes out of date.\" He's discussing New Yorker cartoons, growing up with them, loving them even before he \"got\" them. \"A contributor friend of mine once announced that there should be no more cartoons in the magazine. 'That time is over,' she said firmly.\" That time is indeed over, for many publications, a fact bemoaned by cartoonist and comics columnist Phil Maish over at  Escape Into Life, but Angell is glad still to have them, as am I. Even when I don't \"get\" them.But now I \"get\" this, the Mermaid Butter Cookie brand from Denmark. Because my son has been to Denmark and seen the Mermaid. She's \"The Little Mermaid\" of Hans Christian Andersen, and my childhood is washing over me again, and I've found my shell collection. Oh, this! Go see this beautiful shell art by Shell Rummel, also at EIL!Oh, it's a Random Coinciday in the blog, and, if I don't get this posted before midnight, also/almost a Slattern Day!**Today (or yesterday) I almost resisted temptation at the library book sale.

I feel great loyalty to certain authors, and if busy years go by when I lose track of them, I do like to go back and catch up. This one was published in 1995, when I was busy with a five-year-old and a baby, but I'm glad to have read it now. The title phrase connects to this picture of life uttered by Nat, lovable grandfather of lovable Noah: \"See, I've always pictured life as one of those ladders you find on playground sliding boards--a sort of ladder of years where you climb higher and higher, and then, oops!, you fall over the edge and others move up behind you.\"Ladder of Years is the story of a woman who walks away from her life one day. I won't say more about that, as you'll want to read the book to find out how that turns out. I will say that I identified with her and have also walked away!--out the back door and around the block to blow off steam! Nearly literal steam...as the walkout was occasioned by fixing dinner (boiling water for rice, etc.) while two grown men in the dining room could not manage to keep the then two-year-old out of the dangerous kitchen. I kept him out, finished dinner preparation, and left it ready on the stove during my little escapade. Sigh....

I loved Olive Kitteridge, book and mini-series (with Frances McDormand and Richard Jenkins), for how it helps you get to know difficult people, and get over your own tendencies to judge and dislike people, even if they don't! Ha! I have also read The Burgess Boys and Abide With Me, so now I yearn to read My Name is Lucy Barton, but I will have to wait till it becomes available at the library! Amy & Isabelle is a lovely, realistic mother-daughter story. I just learned, tonight, that there's a tv movie of this, but surely there's nothing Hallmark about it, is there?! (Though I'm a sucker for Hallmark.) What I admire about this book, and her others, is how people change, over time, how people learn to face or tell the truth. In life, perhaps, some people never learn this. In art, we learn how much courage it takes. How gradual or how sudden it can be. How human. As always, art teaches me how to be human."},

But, oddly, it, too, was \"surprisingly upbeat,\" despite the horrific situation and its realistic aftermath. My paperback copy had an interview with the author, Emma Donoghue, who stressed that it was about mother love--yes!--but without sentimentality. Indeed.

Zatarain's red beans and rice from a box, simple, but with a bit of a New Orleans kick.As we began to eat, our friend said, \"You have served me the traditional meal I would eat during my Nineveh fasting.\"What?! I love when that happens. Red beans and rice--no meat--would be appropriate at the end of his Nineveh fasting period.

The Man Who Never Was!\" (And, really, I think my mind nearly linked it the way I have linked the title to the IMDb entry, because I sort of dream electronically now. It's scary. I was updating my daughter's FAFSA in my dreams last night, I think....). And Ian McEwan was indeed referencing that case!OK, there are way too many random coincidii for my brain to handle today: all the Ian/Ewen/McEwan similarity, the sweet toothiness, even the beaches.****Because I need a book-in-progress for breaks at work and at home!**And that doesn't work for those breaks.***I have never seen Beaches.

{"title": "Being Mortal", "date": "Monday, January 25, 2016", "text": "I am indeed enjoying this book, Being Mortal, by Atul Gawande, and learning a lot from it. I'm glad that doctors may begin to think differently about how they handle death as part of their medical practice, and I am also pondering how we, as humans, handle our own aging and the aging and death of our loved ones. I know I am mortal, but do I truly, madly, deeply know it?I love it when I read something that applies not just to its stated topic but rings true in other ways, Here, Gawande lays out a common metaphor. \"Death is the enemy. But the enemy has superior forces. Eventually, it wins.\" Too often the sick person has to be a warrior in the battle against a disease, and surrender is seen as weak, as a shameful thing, a giving up. But Gawande is honest about death always winning, and some illnesses and injuries are fatal. Why not be reasonable about that?He expands the death metaphor this way:And in a war that you cannot win, you don't want a general who fights to the point of total annihilation. You don't want Custer. You want Robert E. Lee, someone who knows how to fight for territory that can be won and how to surrender it when it can't, someone who understands that the damage is greatest if all you do is battle to the bitter end.I love Robert E, Lee! (I wrote a poem about him once.*) So the other way I love this battle metaphor has to do with conflict itself. There are people I don't want to fight with because they are this kind of general. What's the point of winning the \"battle\" or argument if both opponents are metaphorically annihilated and, not metaphorically but really irrevocably harmed or changed by the fight? There are some battles I cannot win, not because I am wrong and my opponent is right but because 1) there is no resolution to this particular conflict and 2) my opponent is a General Custer.In that kind of conflict, I can still honor the argument and live a life based on my own observations, principles, and beliefs without engaging in a hopeless battle unto obliteration-of-relationship. Indeed, \"the damage is greatest if all you do is battle to the bitter end.\" It's sometimes tempting to engage, so not to appear \"weak\" or lacking in principles, but it's a temptation I must resist! Thanks, Gawande, for your insights on death, on conflict, and on life. And for alerting me to this guy,** who's in Being Mortal and The Washington Post. A doctor/thespian. On a Random Coinciday.*Called \"Making Love to General Robert E. Lee,\" published in Poems & Plays**Dr. Bill Thomas"},
{"title": "End of Your Life", "date": "Saturday, January 23, 2016", "text": "I read a charming book, for a library book club, called The End of Your Life Book Club, by Will Schwalbe. He's telling us about the end of his mother's life--coming via pancreatic cancer--and the books they read together and discussed. She is a generous woman, working hard for refugees, and he is a nice guy, generous in giving us this book. It reminds us to use the time we have to sustain good relationships with loved ones, to learn about others by reading and talking, and to do what good work we can while we can. It reminds us that the loved one lives on in the books, in the shared reading experience.I love that Will Schwalbe provides a list of the books they read together at the end, and authors they discussed or read short works by (poems, stories, essays). I've read several of the books on the list on my own or with book groups, and I made a short list of things I want to read based on what he and his mother said about them, including People of the Book, by Geraldine Brooks, which I just finished last night! I enjoyed moving back and forth in time with Brooks's characters and learning about the Haggadah, book-making and art practices over time, and the lengths people will go to protect what they care about.The End of Your Life Book Club also made me want to read Crossing to Safety, by Wallace Stegner. But right now, I'm reading Being Mortal, by Atul Gawande, a doctor. The subtitle is Medicine and What Matters in the End. I think the answer is going to be: quality of life. But it will be nice to hear it from a doctor in the 21st century.Being Mortal was given to me by a doctor who saw me reading The End of Your Life Book Club and also recommended to me by another doctor, who was very moved by it.

I read the hard copy back when it was brand new and a 7-day book at the library. Now my book group is reading it, I am the host (in early February), and I knew it would be wise to re-read it. The hard copies were out, so I tried it as an audiobook, read aloud by Kimberly Farr, a Broadway actress who, I see from her bio, \"created the role of Eve in Arthur Miller's first and only musical, Up From Paradise, which was directed by the author.\" Neato!I think she must have been in the University of Michigan staging of it in Ann Arbor, to have created the role, so to speak, because someone else plays Eve in the New York Times-reviewed version that has Len Cariou as God and Austin Pendleton as Adam. (It looks like it was a flop, as was The Creation of the World and Other Business, the non-musical version of Genesis by Arthur Miller, but I do remember that being a big hit in speech tournaments around that time!) Sigh... Making a living in the theatre is hard.Anyhoo, back to the spool of blue thread. I was so glad I listened to the book, for now the image of the actual spool of blue thread, used for mending a dashiki shirt, is salient in my mind. So is a Swedish blue porch swing, and all the kinds of love and forgiveness we might witness or long for in the world. I love Anne Tyler. I remember how an excerpt from Dinner at the Homesick Restaurant first wowed me. Oh, and that reminds me of fried chicken, made by more than one woman in more than one generation in A Spool of Blue Thread. But, most recently, in my mind (and ears), Nora. As the host, I might conceivably make fried chicken for my book group, but I think we will all be better off if I don't.Now, stop reading to avoid a spoiler, but I am also going to try to avoid it by not telling you who did what and why.... Instead, I'll ask this blend of an interpretive question (as it applies specifically to a character and action in the book) and an evaluative question (as we might apply it in our lives): When is it (or is it ever) a good idea to \"pretend not to see\" the deep emotion of one of our fellow passengers in life? And why, or why not? If and when you have read the book, you will know why I am asking, and you can answer for this character as well as yourself!"},
{"title": "Must Dash!", "date": "Wednesday, January 6, 2016", "text": "Reader, I finished it. I refer, of course, to the book I wasreading—Between You & Me, by Mary Norris. Loved it through andthrough, and enjoyed learning where the name \"the Bronx\" came from.Not telling, no spoilers. You'll all want to read the Confessionsof a Comma Queen (subtitle):  People who like the play Wit would like the chapter on the semi-colon. My niece, Jessa,would appreciate the chapter on the apostrophe. My Ohio relatives and friendswould enjoy Norris's references to Cleveland and the Hocking Hills. Some of usactually vacationed together for a week in the Hocking Hills but not, it turnsout, when the pencil-sharpener museum was part of the visitor center there.Must go back!And my mom will enjoy the whole book, so Iwill let her borrow it, and she can keep it as long as she wants, the way Ikept The Triggering Town, by RichardHugo, so long that she had to replace it. Sigh.... Sorry, Mom. One year for Christmas I got her The Elements of Style, herfavorite style manual, by William Strunk, Jr. and E.B. White, but this was theversion illustrated by Maira Kalman. Then, the very next year, I think, shegave me a copy! So now it's sort of coupling on my desk with the Norris book, ared and yellow coupling that, I guess, would produce orange babies.I am making liberal and, I trust, correctuse of commas here—in celebration! Along with the dash, which also gets achapter in the book. Some copy editors would disapprove of my frequentexclamation points! Some would hate my sentence fragments. But I think MaryNorris would permit me my foibles….if I ever got published in The New Yorker. For now, I share with you one of her paragraphs on EmilyDickinson, queen of the dash. Norris had earlier made this comparison: “Dashes,like table forks, come in different sizes, and there is a proper use for each.”She likens the longer, one-em dash to a dinner fork and the shorter, one-endash to a salad fork. (My use of commas in the previous sentence matches thatof one writer whose commas she let stand; forgive me, I am under theinfluence.) Anyway, here you go:The most famous proponent of the dash was,of course, the poet Emily Dickinson, and it is because of her that, for me, thedash has a feminine slant. With Emily Dickinson at the table, my simplisticdivision of dashes into table forks and salad forks falls apart. She useddashes for everything, and sometimes for two things at once. If a differentsize and style of fork were assigned to each of her various dashes, the tablesetting would require not just dessert forks and fondue forks and those tinyforks used for teasing out snails but also tuning forks and pitchforks. (Norris, page 137)Confessions: I had to compose in Word, not in Blogger, to get myem-dashes to work; I looked up “manual” just to be safe; and I almost alwayshave to look up the word “niece” to get the “i” before the “e,” thanks to amisapprehension of a mnemonic device about nieces and nephews. Sigh…. Thecommas and semi-colon in my Confessions above are a combination of Walt Whitman’s and HenryJames’s usage of commas and semi-colons, and, yes, that is how to make James’s name a possessive!"},

She found what she needed in a life lived mostly at home, baking and writing letters and poems. Legend has it that she dressed all in white, lowered gingerbread out the window in a basket for neighborhood children, and was obsessed with death. Well, death was all around. \"There's been a Death,  in the Opposite House, / As lately as Today--\" (Yes, she used contractions! And slant rhyme, lots of capitalization, and dashes.) Women died in childbirth, frequently, and frequently at home; the sick and elderly died at home; and the Civil War was going on in her lifetime. Lots of death there. The poet Susan Yount used Emily Dickinson for the Death Card in her tarot.You can find more tarot cards by Susan here, at tumblr, and here, in a poetry feature at Escape Into Life, from April (the cruelest month), 2013.It's also Human Rights Day, a day in celebration of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, a document spearheaded by Eleanor Roosevelt after the shocking human rights violations of World War II and adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 1948.Hmm, \"spearheaded.\" Now that's an aggressive word, coming, as it does, from the sharp tip of a spear.

Today I'll take my turquoise-blue tulip to church--leftover from opening-night gifts for The Language Archive--to add to the ongoing home-made advent wreath.My church annually publishes my poem \"Advent\" (about this table-top \"wreath,\" a sort of semi-circle around advent candles) in their newsletter, and I've put it in the blog before, but I'll also offer it below:AdventFirst, we bring rocks: earth curves in a bowaround the source, light.

But we keep putting ourselves back together, mending, healing as best we can, grieving, and being as kind and compassionate as we are able. Some of us seem less able, alas.Whenever I mention my church, I want to mention its progressiveness, the way it honors all faith traditions as well as none: agnosticism and atheism are honored as reasonable responses to the evidence at hand and intelligence (or intuition or instinct) within.I finished a powerful and very intelligent book, Unsuspecting Souls, by Barry Sanders, that beautifully and terribly describes and predicts the state we are in now, placing the death of the human being in the 19th century, when science, philosophy, technology, and industry changed the world and changed the view of the \"human being.\" Sanders understands our current fascination with zombies, the walking dead, because, as a scholar, he can trace it back to when we started walking around dead inside, absent of our former sense of being human. I can see current gun violence and terrorism through this lens. Our horror and grief and compassion in response are signs of life; our sense of it being constant and almost routine, daily, an ordinary occurrence, a testament to the inner death. Makes me re-see my own words, though the irony was intended, and the challenge: \"our own / meager arrival as human figurines, / plaster or plastic.\" Makes me sad, makes me turn on the Christmas tree lights in the morning, makes me wonder what I can write that will also shine a light."},

{"title": "Is Shame Necessary?", "date": "Friday, November 20, 2015", "text": "I am indeed enjoying and learning a lot from the book Is Shame Necessary? by Jennifer Jacquet. It looks like it is, as guilt is a private emotion, and shame has public uses. Jacquet does not advocate a return to public shaming devices like the stocks, but she does explain how shame can function in changing social norms.The thing that struck me this morning was a quotation from an Atlantic article, by Michael J. Sandel, about the market society as distinct from the market economy. Jacquet quotes Sandel saying, \"The difference is this: A market economy is a tool---a valuable and effective tool---for organizing productive activity. A market society is a way of life in which market values seep into every aspect of human endeavor.\" Sigh.... Exactly!This has been troubling me for some time. People are valued according to the amount of money they make, salary-wise, or money they bring in to an organization, even a non-profit organization, not according to their actual contribution of volunteer labor or organizational ideas or management or loyalty or care. Hence, often they are not valued at all, and are treated with disrespect or are valued less than, say, a \"major donor\" who might, say, give money but not actually attend the event, or complain about the seating or lighting.... See what I'm getting at? Hmm, it appears to be a Cranky Doodle Day in the blog. Put 'em in the stocks! (I'm missing a pun on stocks here. And thanks to Austen Redman for the image of stocks in Chapeltown, Lancashire, England!)So, just to be clear, when I complain about the excesses of consumerism or capitalism, I guess I am talking about the \"market society,\" the infiltration of money-based value into the rest of society and culture, not about the economic system itself, which has some things to commend it. But so does socialism. (I'm missing a Hillary pillory, feel the Bern joke here.)"},

My daughter needed As Nature Made Him: The Boy Who Was Raised as a Girl, by John Colapinto, for a sociology course, so I checked it out from the library for her, renewed it, and read it myself. Wow! Truly, wow. Not only is the case fascinating, and the boy (now a man) a brave and beautiful soul, but the science, controversy, and internal conflict among scientists is eye-opening, too. I was struck when one scientist praised another for actually being more interested in the truth than in his career, which reminded me of earlier controversy connected to Sigmund Freud. We always think scientists, who often praise themselves for objectivity and the scientific method, are interested in truth, but, apparently, that's as rare in science as anywhere! Sigh....Now I am reading Is Shame Necessary?: New Uses for an Old Tool, by Jennifer Jacquet, in hopes of finding out whether, indeed, we can shame big business, careerist politicians, tyrants, and terrorists into changing their behavior. Hmm. She's a very clear writer, and, clearly, a scientist or social scientist interested in testing her hypotheses and backing up claims with evidence. So that's good.Next up is Unsuspecting Souls: The Disappearance of the Human Being, by Barry Sanders, which appears to argue that \"the human being,\" the individual we used to value and respect, \"died\" in the 19th century, and the 21st century's willingness to blow people up, for example, is part of that legacy. I must be seeking an explanation, if not consolation, for what goes on today. Yes, it's a fight against despair, a fight for understanding, and a \"fight\" for compassion. But how can we fight for compassion? Well, with words and actions and votes, I hope, since here in the USA we are coming up on an election year. Despite the fact that compassion is viewed as a weakness among many vociferous types in the USA, I still vote for it."},
{"title": "Just Desserts", "date": "Wednesday, November 11, 2015", "text": "OK, for dinner last night I had two desserts: a piece of peach pie, fresh from the oven, yes, still warm (!), and a piece of German chocolate cake. Not small pieces, either. And a little champagne. I would have brought the French champagne, but it cost $50, so I brought the California champagne. This French and German-themed fare was offered at the meeting of our book group, to discuss All the Light We Cannot See. The peach pie was for the tinned peaches that Marie-Laure finds in the house, and the German chocolate cake was for the German occupation of France. Sigh...After All the Light and Lila, I read The Thousand Autumns of Jacob de Zoet, by David Mitchell, about turn of the (18th to 19th) century Japan, and how the Dutch East India Company managed to operate there despite a general policy of Japanese seclusion. Oh, it's about much more!--but that gives it a setting in time and place, somewhat unusual for David Mitchell, really!As with All the Light, this Thousand Autumns shows beautifully how people behave--well and badly, motivated by greed or honor or lust or a crazy yearning for immortality or raw cruelty. I was deeply moved by the rare choices not to inflict harm or take vengeance. In both of these novels, there is great loss, and you hope that someone good will get to live a happy life. In these fictions, as in life, not everyone gets their \"just desserts,\" but some do get their peaches.And that makes it a Fat Tuesday on a Wednesday, the Hump of the Week. With Peaches and Leaves by Jonathan Koch."},
{"title": "Lila", "date": "Wednesday, November 4, 2015", "text": "Right after I finished All the Light We Cannot See, I picked up Lila, by Marilynne Robinson, and read it in two days--the fastest I've ever read something by Robinson. I'd been eager to read it, as it completes a trio of her books set in the small Iowa town of Gilead, which Lila discovers to be a Biblical name after she marries a preacher. As with the other books, I was absolutely gripped by character, by the internal searching, by the simplicity of diction, which gets at the profundity of thought, longing, suffering, and joy. There is a balm in Gilead.The book was at hand thanks to a fabulous-but-forgotten gift card I received for some committee work a couple years ago. Another, more recent gift card, also set aside for a rainy day, but not forgotten for quite so long, rescued me from running out of writing journals. I am grateful for all I am given, even the stuff I forget.In case you can't read the small print, that blurb on the Lila cover says Robinson's prose contains \"the high loneliness of an old blue grass tune.\" Yes! And look at those wildflowers. I yearn for my own back yard to look like that someday. Right now it is covered in red and yellow leaves, except for one bare spot I got on Tuesday afternoon. We got the front yard pretty well cleared, but it keeps coming down! As will the temperatures, all too soon...Makes you want to curl up with a good book. I see that Marilynne Robinson has a new book of essays out, The Givenness of Things, but it may take me a while to get to that. Meanwhile, there's more dense fog in the weather prediction, so another beautiful cloaked morning to wake up in, and maybe another sunny afternoon for raking..."},

Laundry, sorting of papers, burning of some. Why speak of work on a Slattern Day in the blog?I am woefully behind in submissions.

My son's favorite place was Corniglia, and I knew exactly where it was, thanks to a Cinque Terre picture map that functions as a sort of frontispiece in the book. My son loved Italy, and I loved this book, which starts in Italy and then rambles through time and geography in a wonderful way, going to Hollywood and Idaho to somehow critique the twentieth century and bring us right up to date with the craziness of reality shows on tv. We also get to visit the filming of the successful flop Cleopatra (with Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor) and ponder what it means to be a real artist or to \"sell out,\" as they say. I laughed and I sat mouth open in awe at the marvelous truths revealed in this funny novel. The characters are easy to love, despite their flaws (which is what I want from real life, too, and to be loved in that way), down to a character you love to hate and hate to love!We are in the beautiful ruins of summer now, with seedheads feeding the birds and leaves beginning to fall. Real fall starts on the 23rd this year, my calendar tells me, coinciding with Yom Kippur. (Ah, I just re-watched the film Atonement, so I'm coinciding, too.) I'm collecting balsam seeds in envelopes, and soon it'll be time to transplant the vintage geranium back into a pot to bring indoors. Likewise, before the first frost I'll bring in the hanging pots of fucsia, to hang indoors from a curtain rod...But I hope we have many weeks of warmth to come. And many blue skies."},

I try not to, of course, because they are so beautiful and the spider's temporary home and feeding ground, but it keeps happening. And the spiders just keep rebuilding their webs in the same exact spot.Making us equally stupid, I guess.This morning, headed out to work, I walked into the rebuilt web at our back gate, fending it off, once discovered, with the plastic sleeve of a DVD I was returning to the library, and the spider landed on my hand.Big wiggle (from me), no bite (from it). Sigh...I just finished Middle Age by Joyce Carol Oates, and I really liked it.* I need to read more Joyce Carol Oates, and, indeed, there is more, plenty more. She is prolific and varied, sort of like Michael Caine in the acting world, and I love Michael Caine! In this book, Oates looks at a range of people in middle age--a full range of ages within the middle--and how hard, how disruptive, how like the woes of Job this transition can be. It can devastate and transform, or both! These people are unified by place--Salthill-on-Hudson, in suburban New York--and inciting incident: the sudden death of one of them. And that one is philosophical, intelligent, curious, vigorous, and mysterious, somehow leading them all on a journey of self discovery and allowing them, somehow, to arrive at a more authentic place.I am the right age to appreciate this book.*I kept pondering her use of the word \"oblivious\" (as I keep thinking of oblivion as a deep forgetfulness, not a constant and casual unawareness) and wondering about whether it's \"oblivious of\" or \"oblivious to,\" but beyond that trivial meandering of my mind, I was gripped. As if she were a large spider and I were her prey! Ack! Oh, no, am I, in truth, oblivious to/of the ginormous spider webs?!Anyhoo, I recommend this book, if you, too, are in middle age and of a mind to appreciate it. I also recommend Charlotte's Web, by E.B. White, to anyone of any age at any time. (And he would have recommendations for you as to the use of the word \"oblivious,\" etc.) (I think he might disapprove of that dangling \"etc.\" and, in general, my use of parentheses.)Ah, the DVD I was returning was The Turning, which is strangely and wonderfully pertinent, a dark and twisty film based on a book of short stories by Tim Winton, an Australian writer. Gorgeous, compelling, and long, but I was all wrapped up in it."},

They were her senior art project, purchased for display at the Center for Liberal Arts at Illinois Wesleyan University, where one of her paintings will also hang in the Ames Library. (A bit of extra delight: Ames Library was a favorite reading spot for Chris Al-Aswad, who founded Escape Into Life.) And wouldn't you know, our EIL reviewer, Scott Klavan, has just reviewed Dr. Zhivago, the musical.This caused me to remember that when I read the Boris Pasternak novel as a teen, I loved it. \"What did you like best?\" my parents asked me. \"The poetry,\" I answered, surprising even myself. Surely I loved the love story and the battle of political philosophies. But I do remember when I turned to the back of the book and found all the poems there, I was struck by the magic of it; it made it all so real.

{"title": "Speaking of Sayings", "date": "Saturday, April 18, 2015", "text": "Speaking of sayings, Ernest Hemingway said this: \"All things truly wicked start from an innocence.\" That shook me. On a more cheerful note, I'm reading Do-Over! by Robin Hemley, about re-living icky moments to make them into better moments. He quotes W.H. Auden in \"Honour\" saying this: \"The first truth a schoolmaster has to learn is that if the fool would persist in his folly he would become wise; in other words, to leave well enough alone and not to give advice until it is asked for, remembering that nearly all his education is done by the boy himself with the help of other boys his own age. There is far too much talk of ideals at all schools. Ideals are the conclusions drawn from a man of experience, not the data: they are essentially for the mature.\"This struck me in 3 main ways. One: I hope I'll one day become wise as I persist in folly. Two: I hope I remember the necessary restraint till my children ask for advice. So far, sometimes I do, sometimes I don't. Three: I ran into a lot of idealism in my youth and became something of an idealist. Now, I'm more of a realist.A few pages later in Do-Over!, Robin Hemley attends the film Perfume with some teens on a \"Breakout\" from boarding school. Whoa! I've seen Perfume--recently, by chance, making this a Random Coinciday in the blog. (It's supposed to be a Slattern Day, but I tidied up the flower beds.) The film is based on a book.Hemingway continues, \"So you live day by day and enjoy what you have and do not worry. You lie and hate it and it destroys you and every day is more dangerous, but you live day to day as in a war.\" He's talking about his love life. No doubt he had to live this way, a veteran, his life utterly changed by war. But I don't want to live that way. Even if it's folly, I persist in preferring peace.Of course, wise Auden also said this, in \"September 1, 1939,\" a famous poem about the start of the next world war: \"I and the public know / What all schoolchildren learn, / Those to whom evil is done / Do evil in return.\""},
{"title": "Random April", "date": "Tuesday, April 14, 2015", "text": "Busiest April ever. Still writing a poem a day, plus reading plays for a contest, attending play readings, drafting scripts, editing, and working. Sometimes I forget to eat, which can be remedied by chocolate-covered raisins, wine, and giant reception cookies at campus events. Yes! (Making this a Fat Tuesday as well as a Random Coinciday in the blog.) In connection with The Paris Wife, I recently re-read A Moveable Feast, by Ernest Hemingway, which was one of Paula McLain's main sources for her novel. I'd forgotten how funny Hemingway could be, and how snarky, easily betraying his friends, but he is also tender in this memoir, and you hear his regret, and his recognition that his first wife, his Paris wife, was his real wife. \"I loved her and I loved no one else and we had a lovely magic time while we were alone.\" I was surprised at how moved I was by this the second time around. (Moved, heh.)I have never read this book, Random Harvest, by James Hilton, but I remember seeing the movie as a kid and loving it. Wow! That can happen? It's an amnesia story and a love story. Like Septimus in Mrs. Dalloway and various Hemingway figures, the main character suffers from shell shock in the first world war. So my reading lately has connected. Then, the book review editor at EIL posted a review by Sarah Sloat of a book of sayings and I went to a Jesus Seminar on the Road about the Gospel of Thomas, among other things, which is basically also a book of sayings. Thomas Jefferson would have liked it, a gospel without miracles. He is said to have cut up his Bible, clipping out all the miracle stories. Sloat is, during the month of April, writing erasure poems, a similar activity, and other interesting poetry concoctions! I'd say more, but I'm off to see a play in a planetarium."},

Tonight I'll see his movie, Amigo, set during the Philippine-American War. Sayles sure knows a lot of history! And I do love getting my history through books and movies. A Moment in the Sun is about American racism and American imperialism and their intersection at a particular moment in our history. The title comes from W.E.B.

I get her humor, her song references, her use of the word \"schweetie\" as a term of endearment. On a recent business trip, I reread Who Will Run the Frog Hospital? which I liked even better this time around, no doubt because I am older on this second read--not an aspiring short story writer in my thirties but more of \"[a] disillusioned, middle-aged woman,\" as in the opening sentence of this book review from Publishers Weekly. So I get the whole looking-back-on-one's-childhood thing, seeing it all differently. Wanting to be kinder, understanding one's limits, and others' generosity.Here's what leapt out at me this time, a young girl's insight after being sent off to summer camp because she did something wrong (in an effort to do something loving), as she tries to answer her mom's question about what she learned:\"What I'd learned at camp, from all the vesper readings, mostly, was that you didn't give back to the same people who gave to you. 'Let's see,\" I said, stalling. You didn't give back to the same people at all. You gave to different people. And they, in turn, gave to someone else entirely. Not you. That was the sloppy economy of gift and love.\"This paragraph goes on, but here I gasped at the connection to The Gift, by Lewis Hyde, which I'd also been re-reading recently, all about the \"gift economy.\" (Here's a bit of conversation about The Gift at Escape Into Life.) How many times will I have to learn this, I wonder?\"But that was living as a Christian--a practical Christian, but a Christian nonetheless,\" continues Berie in her mind, trying to find the words to answer her mom. \"This, I realized, my parents already understood. Though it was probably not what they'd hoped I'd learn. 'I learned that God is eternal benevolence,' I said finally, a little breathlessly.\"Speaking of book reviews, and of Escape Into Life, there are a couple new ones up--a review by Seana Graham of An Experiment in Love, by Hilary Mantel, a slimmer volume than Wolf Hall, and a review by me of The Robot Scientist's Daughter, by Jeannine Hall Gailey, about the Manhattan project and its scary effects on the environment and human health. In a Random Coinciday kind of way, I can see how the Moore and the Mantel books connect, both about childhood friendships.Speaking of nuclear fallout, who will run the frog hospital?! And speaking of being an aspiring short story writer, I had a bit of good news about my fiction--I'm a semi-finalist in the Press 53 Award for Short Fiction competition, a nice surprise. As \"a disillusioned, middle-aged woman\" with a Lorrie Moorian sense of humor, I've learned to celebrate my nominations and my semi-finalist status instead of waiting around to win.

I had a toasted sesame something-or-other at Green Zebra--the menu changes--and a fantastic soup with celery in it.Later, meeting with EIL poet Yvonne Zipter before heading home on the train, I had a Scorpion Burger at Native Foods Cafe, made with neither scorpions nor \"burger,\" in the usual sense, but rather with tempeh, red onions, and red tomatoes. You can get green zebra tomatoes here, once they are back in stock.So, yes, it looks like I am a vegetarian. However, the weekend also contained beef bourguignon, the famously difficult recipe from Julia Child's book Mastering the Art of French Cooking, made famous again in the blog project and memoir by Julie Powell and the film based on that, Julie & Julia, by Nora Ephron. Oddly enough, I found myself exclaiming over the weekend, \"I love Amy Adams!\" recalling, not this film but Enchanted. (Clearly, it's also a Random Coinciday in the blog.) (As well as a test-the-tornado-siren day in my town.) Now I'm hungry, as it's a late-start breakfast day...Ah, and now I'm recovering from an unexpected shutdown, no doubt ice on the wires.

And I had a fantastic time working with the playwright, Peter Macklin, director, Duane Boutte, and the fine actors in a staged reading of A Different Time, \"a gay-themed play,\" as it says on the program, sponsored by The Prairie Pride Coalition and ISU's Department of Theatre and Dance.And I've been reading Mrs. Dalloway, by Virginia Woolf, inside The Mrs. Dalloway Reader, edited by Francine Prose, which is an excellent way to read it. I particularly loved re-encountering \"The Garden Party,\" by Katherine Mansfield, in its pages. Also, I have images of The Hours, the movie based on the Michael Cunningham book, stuck in my head. (I still need to read the book!) And here's something that makes this a Random Coinciday in the blog. In both The Hours and A Different Time a guy falls out of a window. (On purpose.)The lovely painting of Woolf, above, is by Roger Fry. Here's Virginia in fur. She had an interesting life, with lots of suffering in it, alas, and while she did not fall out of a window, she did walk into a river with stones in her pocket. (On purpose.) Sadly, I have a poem about that, because that seems to be what happens. \"A Foreign Body,\" in Menacing Hedge. Well, this has taken a turn. But I'll be very busy again tomorrow."},

We had decadent pastries for breakfast (4 for a dollar at Jewel), and we're having New Orleans-style dirty rice tonight. This is a summer picture with Mardi Gras beads, not on us. But I'm not so festive after hearing on NPR about the Carnival-related deaths in Haiti. Sigh... So, since I can't dance with my brothers and sisters, I won't dance at all.Instead, I will tell you about the fat cats--well, not so much fat as large, wild, healthy-looking--probably feral cats hunting in my back yard this afternoon in the sunshine. They worked as a pair. First there was some digging in the ground, rolling in the sun against the roots of the sweetgum tree, and eating of dried catmint. I think they might have been getting high in my back yard. It made them all the more alert and attentive...to the birds! The cardinals that nest in the mugo pine. They stalked these birds. They retraced the steps of the flocks of juncos and winter starlings that graze seeds in my back yard. I did not see them kill anything, but I did think of the eternal conflict between Lavinia (cats) and Emily (birds) Dickinson.One (cat, not Dickinson sister) was striped and blotched as if a big, beautiful gray tabby had mated with a giant diamond-backed slug. The other (cat) was also a gray tabby mix, but with a red fox. This is impossible, but appeared true. They were gorgeous cats who took over the yard on Fat Tuesday, looking for things to eat. (Or get high on.) Here are more of the 3 generations of women (sisters, daughters, moms) who met in Michigan this past summer. And here are some Presidents we met on the beach. On Presidents Day. On Facebook. Feral Presidents. Of the mind."},

I got to meet with some women writers to read stories and poems of love, young love, and/or heartbreak. (Also with wine!)And I came home to find 2 of my poems in Flyway! I guess my \"Hawk on the Fence\" poem is sort of a sad valentine, or anti-valentine, or valentine with a twist, but be sure to read the contributor's note. Despite the pink in \"Japonica,\" nothing's really blooming outside yet here...but it will, it will.The next love-poem feature, \"Love, Itself,\" went up at EIL, with fabulous art by Jesse McCloskey, including The Lovers, with green love climbing in the window, and Magic Horse, reminding me of Pegasus, the winged horse of poetry!Has anybody invented the Valentini!

Titled A Different Time, it's a play about how hard it was to be a gay man in \"a different time\" than now, and it's still hard. But it sure makes me glad of and grateful for all the advances in human and civil rights during my lifetime. If you're local, come hear the reading on Monday, February 23, at 7:30 p.m. at Kemp Hall. It's free. The playwright will be present!In the meantime, I will be celebrating Valentine's Day by attending the intercity junior high volleyball tournament. Yes, that's what the love of my life will be doing, coaching his still undefeated seventh grade team, and I'll be there! That's another wonderful thing about the times we live in: girls'/women's sports!There will be chocolate. Beautiful Uptown Normal is having a chocolate walk next week, and I plan to find some chocolate by walking around. I hope I find it at the wine bar! Next week is also my birthday week, people are taking me to lunch the next two Fridays, and I'm gathering with some women writers on Sunday to share love poems and stories--funny or sad--so it's going to be a good February, indeed, even if the bitter cold comes back instead of the annual February thaw I used to enjoy in my college years and beyond.Speaking of love poems, we have plenty at Escape Into Life, in two features already up and another coming up on Valentine's Day itself. The first was Looking for Love, and the one that went up today is Ready for Love, with paintings by Maude McDonald, including the one you see here, View from Within, and, above, This Piece of Me.

It also helps explain the recent weepiness as sickness was coming on. And it's a Random Coinciday, too, because my last blog post was Bittersweet, and that's the title of the most recent book by Colleen McCollough, who just died and got a shamefully weird obituary that her fans are currently mocking.It contained this actual sentence: \"Plain of feature and certainly overweight, she was, nevertheless [sic] a woman of wit and warmth.\" (Perhaps Australians leave out that expected comma after the \"nevertheless.\" Nevertheless, I had the urge to say \"sic.\") (Them bones, them bones, them wry bones...) Consequently, other authors are writing their own silly, personal mock obits in response.Here's mine: \"Kathleen, holier than thou, who just wouldn't dye her hair, still managed to write a few good poems.\"It pains me, actually, to type that--literally because I started coughing in the middle of it, which hurt, and figuratively (and superstitiously) because I have to stay alive for another 21 days, at least, thanks to the Internet Death Quiz, before I can rest easy....I've lost 3 pounds in 3 days, from not eating, not a diet I'd recommend, even for the \"certainly overweight\" Colleen McCullough, not because I have the gastrointestinal \"flu\" but because, in my case, the upper respiratory case, the lung bone's connected to the stomach bone, and coughing is a general disaster. I do like chicken soup and carbonated beverages.There are a jillion books titled Bittersweet, and none of them are on my bookshelf. The closest is Eros the Bittersweet, by Anne Carson, and I'm still on page 108 (the perfect number!) of that. But these are all versions of McCullough's Bittersweet.

I think, according to Facebook, that it is Deb Talan's birthday--singer/songwriter in The Weepies. Many happy returns!I know I am one of the lucky ones in life. I have my health, a loving family, and work I love (even if it is ludicrously un-lucrative!) Today is Fat Tuesday in the blog, and I am celebrating leftover chocolate and the fact that my husband does not have strep throat and thus will not spread it to his volleyball team! In the waiting room, I was re-reading stories by Lorrie Moore, in Bark, a pre-birthday gift from my mom. She knows I read the hardback from the library closer to when it came out and also that I love Lorrie Moore and will want the paperback edition on hand for relentless re-reading of favorite stories and passages.Here's one, from the story \"Wings,\" which is a sort of re-imagining of Wings of the Dove, by Henry James (just as The Innocents, by Francesca Segal, is a contemporary re-telling of The Age of Innocence, by Edith Wharton, and now I want to re-see the film versions of both The Wings of the Dove and The Age of Innocence, and this parenthetical moment is an example of what I mean by \"Fat Tuesday\" in the blog; it's not always about food). Anyhoo:\"Bitterness came when one had done the long good thing and then gone unrewarded. Dench would never operate that way. She,* on the other hand, had been born with a sort of pre-bitterness, casting about for the good and unacknowledged deed that would explain her feelings---and not coming up with it. So instead a sourness could beset her, which she had to appease and shrink with ice cream and biographies of Billie Holiday.\"*\"She\" is a singer/songwriter in this story, making this also a Random Coinciday in the blog. And this is bittersweet, its innocent white flower, its two-toned fruit above, with many thanks, as always, to Wikipedia. But see the food?

It got cold again, after a great Saturday, 40s, two-hour walk in the sunshine, etc., and now it has snowed. Worse for those in the East, I hear. My friend Paulette is sad, but she also knows how to feel better, so that's good. And my hubby is sick, but has been resting and drinking liquids.

Even the fabulous Dianne Wiest has money worries on this Blue Monday....In church this past Sunday, we had 10 full minutes of mindfulness and 7 steps to it, etc. I noticed that I did not, in being mindful, block anything out. I let everything in. I noticed the rain that had turned to snow, the breathing and hacking of the woman next to me, my own breathing, the sweet faces of the congregation, poor Colleen rolling her eyes and checking her watch (we hugged and laughed about this afterwards!), the calm music, the wonderful black legs of chairs against the gray carpet like a miniature stylized forest. I don't see mindfulness as living in a bubble. I see it as walking in the wind, fully buffeted, fully alive, fully aware.*\"Tax man! Tax man!\" (Dialogue from Stranger than Fiction, a movie I love!

{"title": "Imagining Plato", "date": "Thursday, January 15, 2015", "text": "In my ongoing discussion of various gifts, I want to thank my friend Kim for her annual Christmas gift subscription to The Sun magazine. She knows how much I love it! Thank you, thank you!In the January issue, newly arrived, I got wrapped up in the interview with David Hinton, on translating ancient Chinese poetry, and even wrote about it for the EIL Blog on Wednesday (\"Thoughts on Translating Poetry\"). The cover photo is by Harvey Stein, with more Coney Island pix inside. (That's not Plato.)In the middle of the interview, I got stuck on Plato again. I love Plato, but I always run into people blaming Plato for all the faults of Western civilization, for kicking poets out of the Republic, and for the mind/body split, for example. I don't think Plato would kick out any poets; he was one. He was just, in a dialogue, having one guy give advice to another guy that boils down to this: Poets will encourage empathy and imagination in the citizen, which will allow fellow feeling and individual thinking, and if you don't want that in your ideal state, you'll have to get rid of the poets.Anyhoo, in this interview, David Hinton says, \"The ancient Greek philosopher Plato came up with the theory of Forms, which said the truest reality is one of abstract ideas. He thought that Being with a capital B was not part of this everchanging reality [mentioned earlier in and throughout the interview] but some nonmaterial Form that sits behind or above reality and doesn't change, because it's eternal. And because it is changeless, it is more real.\"In a walnut shell, I think that is Hinton interpreting Plato, and I think I interpret Plato differently.I think the key here is that Plato \"came up with the theory\"--that is, he imagined a way of thinking about reality that helps us organize our perceptions into essences but is not to be mistaken for reality itself; we can conceive of a table even if there isn't one right in front of us, but one is a conception and one, the table, is a table. It's not that hard (unless it's made of stone). I can't eat off an imaginary table, but I can eat off a real one. Reality, itself, as a larger concept (with a capital R), contains both the imagined table (Form) and the real table (Table). (Eating [and italics] are extremely important here.)Back to David Hinton: \"Most of the time we take it for granted that we are our mental processes, the analytical back-and-forth. Meditation reminds us that we're not. When you're meditating, watching your thoughts, you see them rise out of nothingness and recede into it. Next comes the question: If I'm watching this mental process, then I must be separate from it. So what am I?\"Um, might you be an essential Form?!That's my awkward sense of humor. But what I am saying is, I feel connected to others and to life even while I am a separate (temporary) \"I\" who is a compassionate \"I\" who is not very lonely in the world because I already feel connected to other humans and to Nature with a capital N, and I still love Plato, a guy with imagination, who has been used and misunderstood, as well as understood, by others for a really long time."},
{"title": "36 Questions", "date": "Monday, January 12, 2015", "text": "Last night I spent 4 hours on the phone with a friend, asking and answering the 36 questions created by psychologist Arthur Aron and referred to in the article, \"To Fall in Love with Anyone, Do This,\" by Mandy Len Catron, published in the New York Times on January 9 and circulating on Facebook ever since. We weren't trying to fall in love. \"I'm already in love with you,\" said my friend. We love each other from way back, from doing theatre together. She's a divorced mother of one, I'm a married mother of two, and it's not about romance for us; it's, evidently, about deepening our friendship over the phone. My ear hurt a little when I hung up--land line, actual receiver--but it was worth it!Obviously, we did not do the staring-into-each-other's-eyes-for-four-minutes part of this process, and we skipped some of the painful questions (about death and family) or awkward-over-the-phone questions, and we were not near strangers, which is part of the premise of the 36-questions experiment in falling in love, but we had a good time and learned a lot about each other and ourselves. Indeed, I think my friend's impulse to call and do this with me came from a deep and important place in herself; she is at a crucial juncture in life, and it's about knowing and accepting who she really is, before it's too late. That's bold to say, but I trust its truth.This listening and sharing is yet another of the gifts I've been discussing as this new year begins, here, the gift of friendship, deepened, as well. My friend ended our conversation expressing her gratitude--me, too! I sense that we both felt the evening to be an unexpected gift.And let me again thank gifted artist Jonathan Koch for letting me use his paintings at my blog. You may know that I yearned for his painting, Walnut, thinking I could not afford it. Well, artists have payment plans, and small paintings can be affordable! So I got myself this gift this season! Plus, I learned I'm not a tough nut to crack."},

Yesterday, I finished reading The Gift, by Lewis Hyde, but,even after Three Kings Day, I am still recounting my gifts, with joy andgratitude: I wrote about the yoga mat here, a gift from my husband, the The Poet Tarot here at EIL, a gift from my son, and today I will riff a bit on gifts from mydaughter, who gave me a practical pink hair dryer (er, to replace the one shetook to college) and a mix tape of songs she knew I would like,* plus Regina Spektor, WhatWe Saw from the Cheap Seats, whichcontains the fantastic song, \"Firewood,\" a song that arrested me inthe kitchen just now. I stood there, listening, rapt, turned to wood. (Wow,that's a really long sentence.) Lyrics here.*My daughter knew I would like the songsbecause whenever her music is on in the car, I ask, \"Who's singingthat?\" It's often Zee Avi or Ingrid Michaelson. Interestingly, the firstsong on the tape was one she didn't know I'd know. \"I know thissong!\" I said. \"What?!\" \"It's from Grease,\" I said, alwaysdelighted to reveal the musicals in their lives to my family members who claim tohate musicals but who love TheSimpsons, which is always spoofing musicals by doing musicals. The song was\"You're the One that I Love,\" sung in sweet slow motion by Angus& Julia Stone. Wikipedia tells me Regina Spektor now has the gift of a child.In TheGift, Lewis Hyde tells of Ezra Pound being turned into a tree in a poem,\"The Tree,\" that begins, \"I stood still and was a tree amid thewood....\" Reading about Pound reminded me of a similar thing happening tome in college, not in a wood but in a window. I stood transfixed, immobile, andturned into a golden tree, the one shining in the sun on the campus quad thatfall, and, likewise, wrote a poem about it. I stood just as still listening to\"Firewood\" in my kitchen this morning. It contains the repeated line,\"The piano is not firewood yet.\" Last night, as on other nights, Itried to play the piano, and sing, and broke down into tears.\"Some day you'll wake up and feel agreat pain,\" sings Regina, \"and miss every toy you ever owned.\"My husband, who left most of his toys behind in Cuba, speaks of a similarfeeling. \"You'll want to go back, you'll wish you were small,\" singsRegina. Now that the relationship with Cuba has begun to change, my husband maybe able to go back! \"You'll take the clock off of your wall,\" sings Regina,\"and you'll wish it was lying.\" I don't know about that, but I doknow it corresponds to the beautiful image of a backward clock from afilm by Eduardo Yagüe made to one of my Claudel poems, “Broken Figure.” Youcan see it here, at The Poetry Storehouse, or here, at Moving Poems, where itis accompanied by a companion film, “Figura Rota,” made for the Spanishtranslation of the poem, also by Yagüe. Many thanks to Eduardo, to Nic Sebastian at The Poetry Storehouse, and to Dave Bonta at Moving Poems. All of this is a gift!Hyde quotes Pound’s speculation on the origin of myth: “The firstmyths arose when a man walked sheer into ‘nonsense,’ that is to say, when somevery vivid and undeniable adventure befell him, and he told someone else whocalled him a liar. Thereupon, after bitter experience, perceiving that no onecould understand what he meant when he said that he ‘turned into a tree,’ hemade a myth—a work of art, that is,—an impersonal or objective story woven outof his own emotion, as the nearest equation that he was capable of putting intowords.”“Love what you have and you’ll have more love,” sings ReginaSpektor. I think that’s the underlying message of The Gift, too, and of all gifts. “Everyone knows you’re going to love, though there’s still no curefor crying.” Thanks, Regina. Thanks, my sweet daughter! For the songs and thesebeautiful images! And the pink hair dryer!"},
{"title": "Snowga", "date": "Tuesday, January 6, 2015", "text": "For Christmas I received a beautiful yoga mat. It is seafoam green with a mandala illustration in the middle that helps me center and align myself, quite physically, as Rodney Yee tells me what to do with my body/mind. \"For seventeen years I have started my day with yoga...,\" he says, which must be 32 or more years by now, based on the copyright on the VHS videotape, which was rendered in Roman Numerals, leading me to an online converter, because I am Roman Numeral challenged.Uh, today I started my day shoveling snow, and A.M. Yoga with Rodney Yee will probably become P.M. Yoga with Layers On. Here's what it looks like, rolled up, and here's where you can get it. (Unless you are me. If you are me, you can just go upstairs and unroll it!)Happy New Year! It's been a great holiday season of connecting and re-connecting with friends, family, my inner child, and my same old, yet, yes, renewed, outer self. I am re-reading The Gift, by Lewis Hyde, the same old 1983 paperback edition I got soon after it first came out with the subtitle Imagination and the Erotic Life of Property. It has appeared since with other subtitles, and the current 25th anniversary edition (?? are we all date challenged??) is subtitled Creativity and the Artist in the Modern World. (I am tickled at the coincidence of my own recent 25th anniversary, and, likewise, our numbers are screwy, too! 25 + 8 years of courtship = 33! Which, you will be glad to see, I did not attempt to render as Roman Numerals.) I like how this somewhat abstract Shaker basket of golden apples suggests endless abundance despite the ragged, woven boundary....None of these subtitles seems to get at what the book is, which is marvelously hard to categorize! It explores \"gift economy\" as cultural anthropology and is part history, economy, comparative religion, literary criticism...and, in short, wonderful. It means even more to me now, more than 25 years later, as I've got way more life experience and it rings all the more true. (I see that the new cover includes testimonials from Margaret Atwood and David Foster Wallace.)When the mat is unrolled, you can see how the mandala illustration has its edges \"cut off\" which makes it extend to the infinite in imagination somehow. And makes me feel kind of skinny. Despite leftover Christmas cheesecake for breakfast."},

Let me tell you about that!First, there is the aforementioned Santa, the one you want to come! You might even leave milk and cookies for him, and carrots for the reindeer. Then there is the Grinch, the one Cindy Lou Who discovered taking away the Christmas tree in Whoville, and who returned it when his heart got big enough.Then there are the uninvited guests. Like me. Don't let me in, even if I happen to barge in. Which, alas, I did, on our way to the holiday book group dinner gathering. There were cars in the driveway, which we expected. We were on Regency Drive, thanks to Google maps, etc. But, alas, we were still on North Regency Drive, just an intersection away from South Regency Drive, our actual destination.\"I'm Kathleen,\" I said to the nice young man who answered the door, apparently the host's husband. I entered boldly, smiling, and encountered a dinner table of guests who smiled back over their wine glasses at me. \"We brought things!\" I said, still in energetic greeting mode, the unfamiliarity of all the faces only just beginning to dawn on me.\"What's in the bag?\" asked one of men as I cheerfully retreated, saying something like, \"Oops, wrong house!\" It was a Victoria's Secret bag, large and pink, with pink ribbon handles, sturdy enough to bring the veggies, dip, and plastic Rudolph-the-Red-Nosed-Reindeer relish trays.... My special happy new year greetings to the folks on North Regency Drive, and thanks for your big hearts! I'm glad I'm not a vampire, for your sakes!All this is coming together on a Random Coinciday as I encounter a particular section of the book I am reading, The Liar's Club, by Mary Karr, as she discusses her imaginary vampire club (and some very icky actual stuff) in childhood. Reading this and Lit in December, I am all the more grateful for my own childhood, the safety and security in my loving family, and the continuing love and relative good health of us all.

In the winter, I am, these days, stuck* with A.M. Yoga.

And I love my morning yoga, don't get me wrong. P.M. Yoga, with Patricia Walden, the lady on the cover of the VHS tape, is too strenuous for me. Downright dangerous, as I can't hold the pose and simultaneously look at her on the tape to make sure I am doing it correctly, so I might 1) not be and/or 2) fall over 3) get stuck in one of her entangled poses (not pictured).Yes, I am still a beginner. But without \"beginner's mind.\" Instead, \"monkey mind\" intrudes on the meditation part of A.M. Yoga some mornings. I fear not. I do the stretching and relaxation, become aware of the monkey, and go complete things on my to-do list.But this year, I am happy to report, I can do this pose, the one shown on this DVD cover. I can do it quite handily, quite leggelly, and have not fallen over yet. But I can only do it on one side, the side required to plug in the Christmas tree, which I positioned in a corner, near an outlet, an outlet that is now blocked by the decorated tree. I left just enough space for me, or Rodney Yee, to get in there and plug in the extension cord, doing this. So far, I haven't gotten stuck in this position. But if I do, I'll be behind the lit Christmas tree, so hand me a book.I often wear my hair this way, as well."},
{"title": "Silver Anniversary", "date": "Tuesday, December 16, 2014", "text": "Today is our silver anniversary, 25 years of marriage! We have kind of a rolling celebration because that's how we...roll. And because our \"church wedding\" was on December 15 while our \"legal\" union was on December 16, with an Abraham Lincoln lookalike justice of the peace pronouncing us husband and wife in the courthouse of downtown Chicago. Our \"church wedding\" consisted of us walking into St. Gertrude's church in the middle of the day, where the janitor was busy vacuuming, to ask God, if available, and the statue of Joseph with toddler Jesus on his shoulder if it was OK with everybody if we got married. Evidently it was.We celebrated last night with pink champagne! We watched the movie Mr. Nobody and talked about time, time loops, love, choices, quantum physics, and other stuff. And there's another bottle of champagne in the garage, because that's our wine cellar.I am reading Committed, the funny sequel to Eat, Pray, Love, at exactly the right time! Of course I also wish I had read it earlier, but she hadn't written it yet when I needed it the most. By \"she,\" I mean Elizabeth Gilbert, who was writing this book while waiting around to marry a man she'd sworn not to marry. He'd sworn, too. I've always loved how the book title evokes a nut house.There are many things I could quote from this book, but I'm going to quote Gilbert quoting Eleanor Roosevelt, because I like Eleanor, and her marriage was an interesting one. Eleanor said, \"All human beings have needs and temptations and stresses. Men and women who have lived together over long years get to know one another's failings; but they also come to know what is worthy of respect and admiration in those they live with and in themselves.\" Yep!I did love Gilbert's list of her own worst traits. It makes me want to list my own! And share it, humorously and earnestly, with my mate of 25 years. We both have silver running through our hair. We respect and admire each other. We make each other laugh."},

It's a novel that allowed me to revisit a bit of the history of Cleopatra, particularly her sister Berenice, who is imagined as surviving and having her own affair with Mark Antony in a fictional land of the past, which is the fictional land of the present that the novel's main characters...land in. My actual sister, who once played Cleopatra, arrives soon after the solstice to celebrate Christmas with us! So, in this way, I am Cleopatra's sister.

I just finished reading Nine Inches, a bunch of short stories by Tom Perrotta, who also wrote Election and Little Children and The Wishbones. These are funny and tender and wise stories about crazy stuff that happens in schools and suburbia, scary yet sympathetic police officers, guys that have some difficulty growing up, marriages falling apart, and wannabe or used-to-be musicians.I cringed at the TMI conversation between a teacher and student in \"Grade My Teacher,\" then marveled at the little turn this story took. Lots of them take a very interesting turn or serious swerve! I winced at the beating a character took in \"One-Four-Five,\" and many of these stories do end with a \"punch,\" so to speak, a sentence that hits hard.\"Nine Inches\" is not about a ruler, nor Converse tennis shoes. It's about the distance kids are to remain apart at the middle school dance, and is measured by a bit of measuring tape, not a hard ruler, as depicted. There's another school party, a high school party, in \"The All-Night Party,\" where we get to see vulnerable people care about each other. That's always nice.Speaking of numbers, my car is fixed! For only $46! Thank you, Davis Tire and Auto! And in the 100 Rejections project, here's the tally so far: 76 Sent, 33 Rejected, 20 Accepted, 21 Pending, and 2 N/A. Amazingly, the math adds up! True, I did not get 100 rejections in 2014, and did not even send out 100 submissions, but I persisted in sending out what I had that seemed ready. Rejection sometimes means it's not ready, and sometimes means it just needs to go to the right place at the right time."},

It's probably the ignition. We have figured this out after two months of fiddling and diagnosis, in the form of conversations with car people, Internet research, and a Chilton book from the library. Don't tell me it's the battery or the alternator. It isn't. Anyhoo, I am glad!! All I want for Christmas is my car fixed. And, OK, a new oven/gas stove. I don't need a dishwasher.Now I am reading All Over Creation, by Ruth Ozeki, which, as you can see, is about potatoes. And a bunch of other things. Actually I am reading the edition with seedlings on the cover. I love Ruth Ozeki.

{"title": "The Blue Flower", "date": "Thursday, December 4, 2014", "text": "Inthe middle of the night, I finished TheBlue Flower, by Penelope Fitzgerald, making good use of a couple ofsleepless hours. In the book, the character of Fritz (who will grow up to beNovalis) has begun a story in which a listener is enraptured by a stranger’sstory of a blue flower. There is also treasure, in the form of conventionalriches, but the narrator longs to seethe blue flower and Fritz, the writer, asks, “What is the meaning of the blueflower?”Stopnow, if you don’t want to hear another character’s answer to the question. Butusually a symbol in literature can mean many related things; a symbol has greatcomplexity, interpretations that ripple out like circles on a pond. (Wikipediakindly ripples out the meaning of the blue flower from German Romanticism tothe present day.) I’m still pondering the blue flower of the novel and won’tname all the ripples I see, but I do plan to quote “the Bernhard,” one of thechildren in Fritz’s family, a blond boy also called the angel in the house, wholoves water—the river—and is relentlessly curious.            He had been struck—before he crammed the storyback into Fritz’s book-bag—by one thing in particular: the stranger who hadspoken at the dinner table about the Blue Flower had been understood by oneperson and one only. This person must have been singled out as distinct fromall the rest of his family. It was a matter of recognising your own fate andgreeting it as familiar when it came.Thisis what rippled inside me, the “matter of recognising your own fate andgreeting it as familiar when it came.” (Spellcheck has automatically recognizedand provided the familiar American spelling of Fitzgerald’s “recognising” as Icompose….and I have obstinately changed it back in three cases.)Stillawake, the new issue of The Sun athand, I read the interview with Stephen Harrod Buhner on plant intelligence andnatural healing. You should know that Sophie, the betrothed in The Blue Flower, is seriously ill. WhenFritz first sees her, age 12, across the room, he is inexplicably drawn to her.Says Buhner, “The ancient Athenians had a word for that moment when someintangible part of ourselves leaves our bodies and touches a livingintelligence in the world: aisthēsis.There is an exchange of soul essence accompanied by a gasp of recognition, adeep breath, an inspiration.” As Fritz recognized Sophie, I recognized the Bernhard,with a little gasp at hisinspiration.Andfinally, for now, as I’m sure I’ll keep rippling in the blog, yesterday’s mailbrought the current issue of Quiddity,in which I have a very short poem called “Broken Clouds.” You can hear it here,and it has blue in it. The magazine defines itself up front:quiddity—the real nature oressence of a thing; that which makes it what it is (OED)"},

The Blue Flower is about the philosopher-poet eventually known as Novalis. I love it. Reading it, I was reminded that \"diligence\" is a stagecoach, not just my own painstaking effort..., presumably because it is a persevering if slow-moving apparatus of travel. At Escape Into Life today, we announced the Pushcart Prize nominees, and I wish them all well! I am nominated this year, too, by two fine journals, so I know it is an exciting honor. Diligently tallying my submissions, et cetera, I noticed, before I lost count of things in general, that I've been nominated seven times before, as well, but not yet included in the Pushcart Prize anthology, so I'll end in a large slow-moving stagecoach of hope."},

Poets offer poems for \"remix\" and filmmakers do just that!--remix by re-conceiving poems in their own way, adding available video clips or filming new footage. I love it when Nic records the poem herself, as in this case, when she was also the filmmaker, here at Vimeo! So eerily beautiful!Othniel Smith also made a film of \"Daughter of Midas,\" and I shared it a while back, but here it is again, for comparison! What a delight.He has a wonderful sense of humor.

The first snow was minimal and is gone, but I wrote a poem about it. That matches.Up today at Escape Into Life is my review of The Dailiness, by Lauren Camp. I have been reading this book of poems, gently, for almost a year! That's often what I do for poetry reviews--read and re-read slowly, or read a book all at once quickly, and then re-read slowly.

Today Iam walking to the post office!ButI miss writing the long letter that sends love and news and personality to therecipient, that asks questions, hoping for an answer—by mail!—soon. I miss thelittle illustrations I used to add sometimes and the decorative marginal orclosing flourishes. I miss getting such a letter back. Sigh…I’vejust finished reading A Fire in the Mind,the biography of Joseph Campbell by Stephen and Robin Larsen that excerpts manyletters as a way of delivering information and personality. Several are byCampbell, of course, to his wife and friends and family members. Others areabout him, by these people and various students and colleagues and professionalassociates along the way. Biographers must already be having a harder time re-constructinga life, now that the age of letters is over.OurEIL theatre reviewer, Scott Klavan, just got to see Carol Burnett and BrianDennehy in a revival of Love Letters,by A. R. Gurney, a play that recreates a relationship through years of letters.Generally, the actors simply sit and read the letters, which makes it easierfor actors to do star turns in limited engagements, as in the current Broadwayproduction. Burnett just replaced Mia Farrow, and other actors coming upinclude Alan Alda, Candice Bergen, Stacy Keach, Diana Rigg, Anjelica Huston,and Martin Sheen.

Reading the end of A Fire in the Mind yesterday, I got a short note from Nature, in away. The last chapter has a lot of letter excerpts, several recounting wherethe writers were when they first sensed Campbell’s death. Yes, those intuitionsor premonitions or visitations…that, when confirmed by the facts, make itpossible to construct the myth or narrative of one’s own life, or see one’slife as such a thing.Iwas reading this testimonial by Lynne Kaufman: “I find that beyond all thebrilliance and scholarship, when that fades, still as a man, he was shining. Hewas radiant, the aliveness of the world came through him. The vividness, thevivacity of it, the immediacy and warmth of him. The way the universe was alivefor him, he could transmit that.”Ithad been gray all day. As I read, the sun pushed through, gently, beginning at “Hewas radiant…,” and faded away again during the next two sentences. I like itwhen stuff like that happens. It’s just the sun, doing what it does, shining,and being covered by clouds, and me, doing what I do, reading, and reading theworld for its endless signs of life. “This is my letter to the World,” wroteEmily Dickinson, “That never wrote to Me—” Or, in my case, That neveralways wrote to me."},

At least I can use Campbell's Skeleton Key to get inside it!Anyhoo, on p. 456 is this, from a letter Campbell wrote to Erdman:\"It all puts me mind again of Schopenhauer's wonderful piece on An Apparent Intention in the Fate of the Individual: how the continuities of a lifetime seem, in the end, to have been plotted out by a novelist--all the accidents, apparently uncoordinated as they first occur, concurring finally toward the shaping of an order.\"I've been attuned to that \"apparent intention\" lately, noticing it in my own life, and also hearing a lot about it in current culture, while having forgotten that it came from Schopenhauer, so I suppose he'll also have to go on my reading/re-reading list....

While it soon dissolved into rain, it prompted Judy to recall the past and say, \"I came in with snow and will go out with snow!\" Judy also went out acting, doing a role she had played before, taking over as a sudden understudy for an actor taken ill. Bridgette returned, and all was well, but it made for some extra cemetery drama.Today, on a rainy Blue Monday in the blog, I am playing catch-up again, with laundry, editing duties, general clean-up and organization, and possibly some poetry submission. I have finally read all the sweet cards from the cast of The Language Archive, which I was a bit too teary-eyed to peruse closely at the time, even though I was able to enjoy the gifts of fresh bread, kitchen towels, world music, marvelous scents via incense, and various wonderful doo-dads.

I love that guy, and in the world of serendipity, I share a birthday with his dancer wife, Jean Erdman, and my theatre life took me to her Theatre of the Open Eye in New York, once upon a time!Last night I got to see In the Next Room, by Sarah Ruhl, at Illinois State University. Also beautiful! What a funny, sweet, tender, melancholy play. Very well done. I think this is the last night, and I've urged my parents to go see it, and I urge you, too. Tonight, locally, or any time you have the chance. Boy, do I love that play!By marvelous chance, the actor who played the doctor in In the Next Room was in the audience today at the Evergreen Cemetery Walk. I was able to tell him he was fantastic! I felt so honored and delighted to see him there! It was our second-to-last day, good weather, wonderful audiences. One of our actors was taken ill, and we wish her well and hope to see her back tomorrow, but, if she needs to rest, we're glad our fearless director, and 20-year veteran of the walk, Judy Brown, could take over the role!Anemone, or wind flower!"},

It was the Tuesday morning at 10:00 a.m. test of the system. But it was raining, so the possibility of a tornado was watery in the air! It rained on and off all morning, and the sun came out in the afternoon. It is very good to have finished your speech or scene before the sirens sound, or before the train comes through, or the airplane goes over. We have been very lucky! So have the squirrels. Each day, my scene partner lines up acorns to keep track of how many times we have done our scene (a jillion in all, but 6 or 7 per round), and every morning they are gone. Stolen. Buried.The cemetery workers do a beautiful job of upkeep. When I arrived at our spot this afternoon, one of the men was there blowing the latest leaves out of the family plot. He said, \"I've got to keep the leaves out of your living room.\"And, oh, my, I love lunch. They feed us so well--home-made soups, restaurant specialties, and home-baked cookies. It takes a lot of energy to do our work. And it takes a lot of cookies to keep us going!In other news, I have a new Poetry Cheerleader review up at Prick of the Spindle and two poems in the current issue of Nimrod.

It was 37 degrees when I left the house in my underthings (decent things that I wear under my bustle, etc.) and the high today was maybe 51 degrees. My costume is impossible to put on at home--many hooks and eyes + aforementioned bustle--and impossible to get out of at home, if husband is off coaching volleyball, so I have to make the appropriate arrangements! I play Mary Gridley, historically pictured here, with fan, braids, and bustle.Mary was the first role I played in the cemetery walk, which, as you have probably gathered, takes place outdoors in the actual Evergreen Cemetery (where Dorothy Gage is buried, the model for Dorothy Gale of the The Wizard of Oz). Here is the pink dress (with possible bustle) I wore then, standing next to the Asahel Gridley monument in the family plot. (Pronounced ASH-el, but he was actually a bit of an as&*%le.)And here is the gorgeous pale teal dress with bustle that I (or is that Glenn Close?) wear this year, doing a scene with Jeremy Stiller as Asahel. I wrote the script, titled \"'Til Death do us (Finally) Reconcile,\" and it's a lot of fun to do. He is quite handsome, and I wear a copper snood, plus a black lace thingey on my head, so my hair doesn't fly off in the bitter cold wind, and olive green gloves. Did I mention that it was cold out there? Kudos to the marvelous audiences, all bundled up and full of energy and joy."},

Sigh... It was a lovely experience, and August (rehearsals) and September (performances) have whizzed by the way time does when you are immersed in goodness.This a beautiful perfect apple by Jonathan Koch, and it makes me think of Alta in the play saying, \"My life is like beautiful perfect apple...\" in a marital spat scene in which she continues, \"and then you are WORM who come in and eat the rotten heart--,\" her husband, Resten, interrupting to point out the flaw in her metaphor, \"YES, exactly--ROT-TEN HEART you have--\" and the hilarity continues. I'm sure lines from the play will continue to come back to me for a good while.And it's apple time, too. And I've seen pumpkins ripe in the fields. And some poems are ripening.

So today I am grateful for this skeleton flower, also posted on Facebook--grateful for its beauty and just to know of its existence. It reminds me that I am grateful, personally, that my own bones have not yet dissolved (\"no change\" on my osteopenia bone density scan lab report, sort of fun to see my backbone on the screen). Grateful that my car broke down (electrical system?) in a friend's driveway, not on the road, and that I had my cell phone on me, and that my husband saw the text on his phone to come rescue me. He and I have a similar impulse toward gratitude when these small annoyances or larger mishaps come at us: both times a neighbor's tree fell in our back yard, crushing the fence, it missed the house! It missed a person! Being grateful for one small thing leads to an endless list of things every time.And now, to get back to bones and skeletons, I am grateful that my rehearsal this week, at Evergreen Cemetery, for the annual Discovery Walk, occurred on a beautiful day, and I'm going to hope for similar weather in early October for the 20th anniversary Illinois Voices Theatre--McLean County Museum of History Evergreen Cemetery Walk!And you can learn more about this particular White Lady skeleton flower--from a Hawaiian burial ground!--at Firefly Forest."},

{"title": "Wild Congruence", "date": "Sunday, September 14, 2014", "text": "Early this morning I finished reading Wild, by Cheryl Strayed. I wanted to read it after reading Tiny Beautiful Things this summer, a compilation of several of the advice columns she wrote for The Rumpus. I love Tiny Beautiful Things, so full of compassion and heart and wisdom. My paperback copy has the short orange cover with the quotation sticking out, \"Let yourself be gutted. Let it open you. Start here.\" I did start there, and then I wanted to hike the Pacific Crest Trail with her in Wild, but only as a reader, not in actual hiking boots. (Though I did spend a week on the Appalachian Trail and loved it!)Because things are tying together lately for me, linking up with The Language Archive, by Julia Cho (the play I directed that just opened), I was particularly delighted to run across this reference in Wild to another work with \"language\" in the title, The Dream of a Common Language, by Adrienne Rich. This was the book Strayed kept with her in her heavy backpack, nicknamed Monster, the whole hike.\"I'd carried it all this way, though I hadn't opened it since that first night on the trail. I hadn't needed to. I knew what it said. Its lines had run all summer through the mix-tape radio station in my head, fragments from various poems or sometimes the title of the book itself, which was also a line from a poem: the dream of a common language.\"In the play, L.L. Zamenhof has the dream of a common language, Esperanto, and the character of Emma has a dream of Zamenhof! A baker carries a heavy burden in the shape of a box. (An early thought of mine was to strap it with bungee cords to a backpack! Who, as I like to say, gnu?) The character of George reads all the time and has words echoing in his head.In Wild, Strayed continues:\"I opened the book and paged through it, leaning forward so I could see the words in the firelight. I read a line or two from a dozen or so of the poems, each of them so familiar they gave me a strange sort of comfort. I'd chanted those lines silently through the days while I hiked.\"Now here's the part that struck me as a \"tiny beautiful thing\" and wonderfully, terribly true, shining with other mysteries in the dark:\"Often, I didn't know exactly what they [the lines of poetry] meant, yet there was another way in which I knew their meaning entirely, as if it were all before me and yet out of my grasp, their meaning like a fish just beneath the surface of the water that I tried to catch with my bare hands--so close and present and belonging to me--until I reached for it and it flashed away.\"Poetry is often like that, yes. I advise people at poetry readings just to listen attentively and let the words wash over them like water, not struggling after some exact meaning. Poetry expresses the inexpressible, after all. Keats advised a kind of negative capability, or the ability to rest in uncertainty \"without any irritable reaching after fact or reason.\" In general, art is not about catching a fish. It's always going to flicker away.But even this connects to The Language Archive! The character of the Language Instructor was once in love with a Dutch girl. \"She could swim in frozen rivers, catch rabbits with her bare hands. She taught me how to cook a fish and build a kleedhokie.\" The play is full of funny, lovely, whimsical, unexplained things! For instance, it leaves \"kleedhokie\" delightfully untranslated and undefined, but you can look it up! Another character, trying to explain her \"big thought\" realizes \"this is about much bigger fish.\" There are many fish that get away in this charming play, swimming along beside characters who say exactly what is on their minds and in their hearts, and it seems wise to me just to let that be! Let it be a part of the play-going experience of The Language Archive to leave some of it untranslatable! That's art, that's genius.Update: I meant Julia Cho's genius! And a corresponding genius in the open mind of the audience. Plus, I do hope someday to read The Compleat Angler."},

Great variety of work in the main gallery and a concurrent show, Preserving Parklands, in the smaller gallery.Very organic and environmentally aware.

Since I asked.Today, speaking of the moon, here's a poem with the moon in it, sort of: \"Metaphysics\" in issue a of Floor Plan, a new journal with cool, moving stuff--physically moving stuff, an active table of contents. \"Metaphysics\" is also sort of about roof repair, on my mind lately, as my parents are getting a new roof and I've witnessed quite a bit of neighborhood roof repair in the last couple years. Also, this, at EIL.I'm also awake in the middle of the night in another of the Floor Plan poems, \"But This Might Still be Called 'Waiting for Immortality,'\" which is perhaps also vaguely metaphysical. Sigh...

Thanks to Derek Jensen for that. And, yes, I've got another poem with a mansard roof in it, because I appear to have a poem about everything. And, as of today's randomness, the sheet music to \"Since You've Asked.\")I've been looking at a floor plan of my set lately, and a front elevation, and I'm still obsessed with directing The Language Archive, by Julia Cho, at Heartland Theatre Company. It opens September 11 and contains many voices, in many languages, and a beautiful, sweet, funny cast of generous, collaborative actors.

How does it all come together? I so often stand back in curiosity and amazement.I remember being like this as a child, always asking, \"Why?\" as children do, and \"What does that mean?\" about words, phrases, expressions, figures of speech. I remember the first time my mom answered a \"What does that mean?\" question with, \"Oh, that's just a figure of speech.\" \"What's a figure of speech?\" I asked. Of course.

That's how these intense preoccupations go. Everything I'm reading connects in cool ways, even the things I did not read for research.

A wonderful place with magically delicious bread. Get this, also from A Curable Romantic:Here, exactly as I had been taught as a child, was the Heavenly Bakery, where angelic bakers were busy preparing the manna that will be enjoyed by the righteous at the end of time. Their magnificent ovens were working at full blast. Apprentices in smocks and caps were running with floury wheelbarrows. Master bakers were shouting their orders, opening their oven doors, inspecting their loaves, while their assistants slathered the long work tables with oil and pounded down mountains of dough with giant rolling pins. The scent of coffee filled the air. The music I'd heard below, produced by the circuit of the planets, now blared out of the radios each baker listened to at his station.Our bakery, while heavenly, is not quite this big, but the cast will appreciate the personal music at the baker's station! And I tracked it down (an Internet wormhole), that the heavenly bakery is a real story from Jewish classical texts. May all your Labor Day picnics have plenty of manna. I hope ours has potato salad. And the potato heart comes from Oregon! And, just as the work goes on in the Heavenly Bakery, we do have rehearsal tonight!"},

Maybe he could rig up a similar tarp over the audience before we open on September 11!And/or maybe it won't rain between September 11 and September 28, except on the dark nights. Sigh... I'd be happy to send our rain to California!

My annual physical rolls around in August, and I've already done the follow-up mammogram and bone density scan, thanks to the Gale Keeran Center for Women. I had an eye exam and have ordered glasses online, which means my Facebook feed is inundated with snazzy frames. And I'm reading A Curable Romantic, by Joseph Skibell, a fun way of doing more research on Doktoro Esperanto, or L.L. Zamenhof, for the play I'm directing, The Language Archive. The narrator of the book, here wearing opera glasses, is also an eye doctor, Dr. Jakob Sammelsohn, whose name resonates wonderfully, we learn at the end of part one, in a way I will not spoil for you now.Sadly, Gale Keeran was not curable; hence, the center in her name. Thank you, Jim Keeran. I have always been delighted that Jim's first date with Gale was watching The Fantasticks at my high school. She was the choreographer, and I was Luisa. I guess she got me to dance!Here's a book that sounds interesting: Safekeeping: Some True Stories from a Life, by Abigail Thomas, reviewed at Escape Into Life by Julie C. Graham, who describes the book as a nonlinear memoir. Thomas, too, was married to someone incurable, though it sounds like she was nursing him when he was her ex.And in a poignant full circle, Dr. Basel Al-Aswad tells us, four years later, about mentoring young doctors on the night he lost his son, Chris, who founded Escape Into Life.It's possible I'm a curable romantic. Life has surely taught me much, softened and mellowed me, yes, and also toughened me, opened my myopic, operatic eyes, and left me laughing."},

She's been reading a biography of Somerset Maugham and re-reading some of his stories. And I've been reading a biography of Anton Chekhov and re-reading a couple of his stories, \"The Bet\" and \"Ward Six.\"In that magical way that various things align when one is so attuned, I find Chekhov's view aligning with that of Julia Cho in The Language Archive. Introducing \"Ward No. 6,\" the anthologists say, about Chekhov's work, \"the tragedy and pathos of life is caused by human beings themselves, not by society but by their failure to respond to or even communicate with one another.\" That happens in Cho's play, at times, just as it does in Chekhov's plays and stories. Likewise, \"No other writer except Gogol possesses so fully the genius for arousing laughter mixed with tears.\" Such a mix is crucial to Cho's play, as well as Chekhov's, which he so often considered comedies, even if his audiences (and the Moscow Art Theater) didn't. Tee hee, sigh...Speaking of Russian writer-doctors, I've seen a couple episodes of A Young Doctor's Notebook, starring John Hamm, based on the works of Mikhail Bulgakov, who also wrote The Master and Margarita, one of my favorite books of all time. It's a mix of comedy and tragedy, too. (Read this.)OK, students are after me tonight. I just bought Christmas wrapping paper to finance a junior high field trip.

It's my daughter's book, a Christmas present from Grandma, and she read it right before me, wanting to read the book before seeing the movie. We both like the humor in it, and my daughter is annoyed that the movie apparently leaves out some of the tough and annoying reality about cancer treatment that the book leaves in. (But I do see the oxygen tank cannula in the movie poster, so that's a good sign.) I also, of course, heard a good interview with John Green on NPR! And I sort of want these shoes.Since every day is a Random Coinciday, I must note the reference to language difference and, specifically, the Dutch, in this book, on p. 209, where the narrator tells us the Dutch call lattes \"wrong coffee\" because they have \"more milk than coffee.\" In The Language Archive, the play I'm directing, the Dutch are pertinent, as are different ways of saying things.

Bread is an important part of the play, and Cho has used a quotation from Jacob's book as the epigraph to her play:\"'Why should I take up such a burden?' I thought to myself. 'Who would ever finish gathering so much material?' But then I did take up the burden.

Loop-de-loop. I hope all the wine has worn off by then.) I think this means I live a fairly unplugged life much of the time. Or nobody likes me.We had a lovely time in Michigan! Good company, good fun, good food, good wine. That's me, my mom, my sister, and my niece. Why does my mom look blurry? Why is the bust of a woman wearing Mardi Gras beads looking down her nose at us?At week's end, I attended an annual champagne-drinking girls sleepover, while the hubby and kids visited the Garfield Conservatory (wow!) and played beach volleyball with friends.It was also a thrill to read poems at Woman Made Gallery on Sunday afternoon, with a fabulous bunch of poets. I got to meet Donna Vorreyer, a poet I admire, and other fine poets who were also reading or in the lively, lovely audience. It was grand to meet several people I'd only met online. \"You're so real,\" I said to Donna, who had/has a couple readings of her own in Chicago this month, too.

Meanwhile, the pink blossoms will pour out their beauty.I didn't know what a Beguine was till I went to Wikipedia to learn a bit more about that lovely song. It's a Christian lay woman who did not marry. Now I want to know more, which is what always happens when I learn a little. Likewise, with L.L.

He tried so hard to help foster a world without war. Tonight I saw The Railway Man, a war movie about reconciliation. With Colin Firth.

What wonderful, brave, generous, patient, lovely, talented actors turned up last night! I'm looking forward to tonight! But, whew, it's been a whirlwind of theatre, lately.The three one-acts in the New Plays program, all on the theme of Escape, were so well done. Great audiences. Our guest playwright, Scott Klavan, a New York actor, director, and playwright--who does a lot of work with new-play development--gave an inspiring talk on Thursday night, a workshop to the 3 winning playwrights on Friday afternoon (he was the judge in the play competition), and attend the Friday and Saturday performances, talking with the playwrights, actors, and theatre staff. He's a great guy, very kind, very smart, and a fellow of high standards. As a theatre reviewer for Escape Into Life, he tells it like it is. Example: his review of Antony and Cleopatra at the Illinois Shakespeare Festival. He saw a matinee while he was in town.I was interested in his take on the contemporary \"battle of the sexes\" and other parallels in regard to how Antony and Cleopatra plays today:The parallels to 2014 are startlingly apparent: the large number of modern men who feel emasculated by the growing power of women; the women who struggle to balance their love of achievement with their love of men; both sexes’ problematic decisions regarding the battle of family versus career; rising political reputations brought quickly, thunderously down by embarrassingly sloppy, explosive corruptions, mistakes, and lusts; the cowardly Little Men of Terrorism replacing the bold, undaunted past warriors of gigantic armies and causes.And, to make it a perfect Random Coinciday in the blog, I saw these great new feminist posts in two of my favorite blogs, Bitter Gertrude and The Bloggess. The Bloggess explains a hullabaloo about feminism with her usual high hilarity, and Bitter Gertrude is also very funny in telling today's playwrights and screenplay writers which stereotyped characters to stop writing!"},

I'm honored to be part of this reading. Many thanks to WMG and to Nina Corwin, reading curator.I'll also read some poems in the voice of Camille Claudel, who was \"boxed in\" at an asylum for the last 30 years of her life, from my book Interior Sculpture, the one connected to Claudel, the dance production by Columbus Dance Theatre.In the meantime, my brain feels a little scrunched into calendar boxes, as I attend rehearsals in preparation for the Mike Dobbins Memorial New Plays from the Heartland, a presentation of staged readings of 3 winning one-act plays at Heartland Theatre Company. I'm the dramaturg for this, as I was for Earth and Sky last fall, and I am so enjoying working again with director Don LaCasse. I learn so much from his gentle, focused style. The plays, though quite different, work beautifully together and are different takes on the theme of Escape!If you are local, I hope you'll come see the plays and listen to the guest playwright, Scott Klavan, who will give a public talk--free!--on Thursday night, July 17, at 7:30 in the theatre. He'll answer all our questions on the state of new writing in the theatre today! Klavan is a wonderful actor, a playwright, and a director of new works.

First, each of us needed to discover, identify, or choose a community to which we belonged, and one we felt we could speak for. I often feel slightly outside all the groups or communities I'm in, because I'm a writer, standing at a little distance, because I can't help it, I was born that way, OK? But I could strongly identify with the \"impressionable,\" those on whom experience leaves a significant, er, dent. In positive terms, I am sensitive and full of empathy. In negative terms, I'm gullible and, well, in some people's eyes, weak. That's annoying. On the other hand, I'm OK with that, as I understand my deep reserves of strength.As a child, I believed what I was told and/or had the imagination to make the fictional very real. Like, um, a child.

This Reuters article notes striking parallels between the current state of the world and the state of the world then. Sigh...John Guzlowski is looking back on his reading, his losses, and World War II in these poems in Escape Into Life, posted with beautiful and heartbreaking art by Margarita Georgiadis, also seen here in paintings titled Time Past and Anointed.I've been looking back at my own poems this spring and summer, as I revise and submit them and prepare and revise chapbook and full-length manuscripts for submission. Since we are six months into 2014, I realized I should do a tally toward the 100 Rejections project again, and, after struggling only a weensy bit with the inevitable math of it, I came up with totals that actually added up! I have sent out 42 submissions, had 15 acceptances and 11 rejections; 15 packets are pending, and 1 is an N/A as it was returned unread since the publisher is backlogged. And it was a nice return.What a busy time it's been and will continue to be this summer and fall. I like it, but I am also glad of down time, quiet mornings on the patio, steady breathing in the pool during meditative lap swimming, reading books of poems and short stories, and moments just staring at the petals of flowers or listening to birdsong."},

Heads up: this is a Random Coinciday in the blog, so things may zig, and they may zag. For instance, what you see here is Vivien Leigh in Caesar and Cleopatra. (Clearly, not wearing a Tata Top, nor a swimsuit at all. Great braids.) Since it's in black and white, this may qualify as a Throwback Thursday, but, given the #FreeTheNipple aspect of the Tata Top, it's also a Thor's Day in the blog. With a pink hammer. (I am for breastfeeding and for funding breast cancer research. There are all kinds of ways to do these things. If you are for these things, you will find your own way.) I don't know why I keep bumping into Vivien Leigh. And, in case you were wondering, my new swimsuit has not yet disintegrated! And this morning I swam in dense fog. Which means nothing in a swimming pool!Speaking of the body, here's a beautiful riff on the beauty of the body by Paulette Beete, who is writing about her body these days in her blog. It made me look at my toes, which seemed strangely beautiful because I had painted them red to dress them up so I could wear flip flops to the theatre last night. The only bright red nail polish in the house (to match my red shirt) was called Phantom Freaks; it was blood-colored, for Halloween, but it worked just fine.Speaking of freaky and strangely beautiful things, here is a very short film made to one of my poems, \"Daughter of Midas,\" read by Nic Sebastian of The Poetry Storehouse. The filmmaker is Othniel Smith of Cardiff, Wales, using archival video for his darkly humorous poetry mashup. He's also a playwright and theatre and film reviewer, a man of many talents. I love the little final touch--to the glasses, by the window dresser.Here are  some more figs by Jonathan Koch. And here is a parade of lady parts, featured at a website run by a man but written by women, named for a strange undergarment of days gone by (the bustle).

Because Friday morning, as I got ready for Early Bird Lap Swim, my husband, from bed, said, \"Is your swimsuit see through?\"I denied it, saying it was getting a little thin on the sides, yes, but nowhere important. But, he could see my backside. Really. Please pardon me, Friday morning lap swim pals!But then....! In the afternoon, I went to the Young at Heartland Showcase, a set of scenes and monologues performed by the 55+ acting troupe that I've been working with as an instructor, along with Sarah Salazar. It was joyous, hilarious, and wonderful! If you are local, you must come see it Wednesday night, June 25, at 7:30, at Heartland Theatre. And be sure to see Fowl Plays, the 10-Minute Play Festival, too, if you haven't already. Fowl Plays runs through June 29, but the YAH Showcase has only one more show in the theatre; otherwise, they tour.Anyhoo, I received gifts! The perfect journal, Notes of a Dramaturg (that's what I'm doing next at Heartland, for the Mike Dobbins Memorial New Plays from the Heartland one-act play contest, so I will take notes in this journal!), a card saying, \"Actors speak louder than words\" (true), and a gift card to TJ Maxx, which allowed me to buy a new, non-see-through swimsuit!Today, even though it is Slattern Day in the blog (and I don't think Blanche DuBois did any dishes), I was not a slattern. I woke early, wrote down an important dream, washed dishes, folded laundry, and then got on my bike to join a small biking group. We met at Uptown Circle (aka the water feature), and I got to watch workers take down a big tent. Why? Today was a whole music festival! Why not leave it up for the bands? Then we rode many miles, even all the way out to see my folks and beyond! And back!I was the only girl. (This has nothing to do with the swimsuit incident, though one of the bikers is also one of the swimmers.) Many miles. I will probably be a little sore in the morning.

{"title": "Revising My Compost Bin", "date": "Wednesday, June 18, 2014", "text": "A couple years ago, following the instructions on an Internet video, I created a compost bin out of an old garbage can! I was delighted with myself. And, on down the road, with the compost. Which...composted rather slowly...and which I did not therefore use that regularly. But this year's balsam seeds, planted in a bed enriched by compost, have risen. Looking ginormously healthy.So this year I revised my compost bin. This was like creating and revising a poem. I thought about it, I gathered materials (boards at hand in the woodpile, the usual suspects of pitchfork and hose), and, without nails or hammer, assembled a diamond inside a square former sandbox, into which I dumped the compost, covering it with re-purposed boards that can be easily lifted to add more compost or to stir it or to scoop it out for use.The earthworms---already in the earth!---can easily find it, and no more insects will die, trapped inside a plastic former garbage can, unless they want to live their entire life eating compost.There are holes in the boards or slats between them...so they can get out!Anyhoo. It's been that kind of day, and that kind of spring. Many, many small things accomplished daily in dribs and drabs, and much blooming. Currently: gloriosa daisies, purple echinacea, yellow snapdragons, blue lobelia, pale blue flax, the trellis roses, the pinks, blue and red grape spiderwort, and the ginormous golden columbine. Plus, stuff in hanging pots!Sudden poem acceptances---yay! Tomorrow I attend a gala honoring wonderful local history makers. (I wrote the script for the entertainment at this event, performed by some marvelous singers and musicians, and directed by Rhys Lovell, himself a brilliant actor...who was a little boy when I was a teen summer drama workshop leader for the Parks & Recreation Department. Ah, life.) Friday I attend the showcase performance of the Young at Heartland theatre troupe, people 55+ who have taken up acting later in life, often after their careers in something else, or during their careers in something else. It's been a joy to work with them as an instructor in their current session. Many thanks to Julie Kistler for covering these and other theatre and arts events in A Follow Spot.Hmm, speaking of a follow spot...this isn't that. It looks more like a movie projector, right? Projecting a bird. Anyway, today, you can find the neato, cool, \"Dear Teen Me\" poet Kelly Cockerham (and a \"Mockingbird\") up at Escape Into Life, with art by Ryan Mrozowski, which you also see here. In Dead Men's Float, The Enthusiasts, and Bird Test. It's a Random Coinciday and a Poetry Someday on the Hump of the Week."},

Listened to live music, talked with sweet people, visited old homes (restored and/or renovated).

And two poems, in the current issue of Poetry Porch: \"Wild Columbine\" and \"Transported.\" This is a fascinating issue, and I'm tickled to be in it with Frederick Turner, one of my professors at Kenyon College, who helped revive the Kenyon Review.I suppose that makes it a Random Coinciday as well as a Poetry Someday in the blog."},
{"title": "In a Fog", "date": "Thursday, June 12, 2014", "text": "Dense fog this morning, and then I was swimming in it. Lap swimming. Driving in fog is mysterious and weird, delightful and scary. Swimming in it is just like swimming without fog, since it's close up and just like the mist on other mornings when the water is warmer than the air.I feel in a sad fog lately about the recent shootings. We know better than to keep on keeping on without enough gun control. Poor Emilio, in the wrong place at the wrong time. He loved soccer, his mother said, and now he'll miss the World Cup. A small, ironic shame inside a huge, horrific one. Shame on us.How will we fix it?**Brazil.My computer is in a fog, too, aka slow motion. I feared acquiring a virus from someone I communicated with recently in a professional capacity, so I cleaned everything, and the slo mo may just be the computer reacquiring all its cookies.Or it might be fumes. Remember how my husband paints, lately, with paint thinner? Imagine my dismay, and the hilarity, of finding toxic fumes in Bark, by Lorrie Moore, the story called \"Paper Losses.\" In this story, a woman's husband (shortly before a divorce) is building model rockets in the basement. She's talking to a supportive friend about her unsupportable life and the general lack of marital communication:\"I ask, 'What the hell are you doing?' I ask, 'Are you trying to asphyxiate your entire family?' I ask, 'Did you hear me?' Then I ask, 'Are you deaf?' I also ask, 'What do you think a marriage is? I'm really curious to know,' and also, 'Is this your idea of a well-ventilated place?' A simple interview, really.\"I love Lorrie Moore. It's scary, as I said before, how much I identify with her characters and situations, wishing I could be half as funny, but I'm happy to report that I simply ask my husband to wear an appropriate mask while painting with paint thinner. I'm pretty sure he's not trying to kill us. Or himself. Summer is good. We can open the windows.Yes, I got to the library, and they had Bark, and I answered most of my own questions. Yes, dogs. Yes, trees. Plus people barking at one another instead of communicating more gently and in human language. I'd have figured out the tree part if I'd looked closely enough at the cover image, but I was focusing on the words, fog colored."},
{"title": "Birds of America", "date": "Monday, June 9, 2014", "text": "I'm re-reading Birds of America, a book of short stories by Lorrie Moore, for book group, which meets later in June. It came out in 1998, and I guess I didn't read it then, but I'd read several of the stories when they first came out in magazines. I read the collection in May. And now I am reading it in June, following the Great Books shared inquiry discussion method advice of reading it twice before talking about it.Each of these stories has a bird in it, or a reference to birds, or a bird image, or bird poop (as on the Blarney Stone in Ireland...which my parents visited; I will have to ask them about the angle of kissing, the lipstick marks, the bird poop). The bird might turn out to be a bat. Moore's current book is called Bark. Will there be dogs? Trees? Dogs peeing on trees? Must find out. At the library!*I love Lorrie Moore's stories. I get her humor, her references. We know the same show tunes. She's hilarious and melancholy. I sympathize with her flawed, suffering, funny, smart, pathetic characters, and sometimes rather too closely identify with them. For example, Olena, a librarian of Transylvanian heritage, her name an anagram for \"alone,\" in the story \"Community Life.\"*\"When Olena was a little girl, she had called them lie-berries--a fibbing fruit, a story store--and now she had a job in one. She had originally wanted to teach English literature, but when she failed to warm to the graduate study of it, its french-fried theories--a vocabulary of arson!--she'd transferred to library school, where everyone was taught to take care of books, tenderly, as if they were dishes or dolls.\"There's a vampire thing going on in the background of \"Community Life,\" and this is subtly countered in the story that comes next, \"Agnes of Iowa,\" in which a writing teacher advises a student to avoid the trendy vampire genre in her own creative writing. Olena in \"Community Life\" is pale and withdrawn and grows reclusive; her boyfriend, rationalizing his own bad behavior, accuses her of \"sucking the blood of [the community]\" instead of contributing to it. But she can see the falseness in people's cheerfulness and politics. Of course, any time she does try to be \"normal\" or human, or to contribute to the community, it is always devastating. You can see why she retreats.The stories in Birds of America are all realistic. I read that Bark contains a ghost story. I guess Lorrie Moore is trying genre writing now. Edith Wharton did ghost stories. I like a good ghost story. A character named Mack, in Moore's story \"What You Want To Do Fine,\" is horrified, as was I, to learn that John James Audubon shot the birds he painted. But I learned this from a Eudora Welty story. Geez, I learn a lot of things from fiction. And poetry.\"He shot them?\" Mack kept asking. \"He shot the damn birds?\"\"Revolting,\" said Quilty loudly. \"The poor birds. From now on, I'm going to give all my money to the Autobahn Society. Let's make those Mercedes go fast, fast, fast!'That's characteristic Lorrie Moore humor and word play.Saturday night I saw Fowl Plays, the 10-Minute Plays at Heartland Theatre Company. Each of those had a bird in it, too. What fun! And that makes it a Random Coinciday in the blog."},

Poet Rob Carney was recommended to me by the wonderful Scott Poole. Thanks!Why the lightning? Because of last night's thunder-storms and this morning's steady rain, which kept me away from the pool, alas, for lap swimming.Why a comedy skit?

I love this organization, its slogan (\"World Peace...Grown Locally\"), and its local program. (Read more here, scroll down to Illinois for Bloomington-Normal press coverage.) In the Life Raft: Israel program, 5 Jewish Israeli youth and 5 Arab Palestinian Israeli youth get to come together and do fun stuff and form friendships by visiting towns in the USA, as it's difficult to do such a thing (in an organizational way, publicly) in Israel. Privately, people get along together well all the time!Before we left, we sang a song, \"Salaam,\" by Mosh Ben-Ari, arranged by Rick Recht, in English, Hebrew, and Arabic and got sent off by the Song of the Shofar.We walked from Moses Montefiore Temple to the Islamic Center, 3 miles, and it was very hot! We were greeted by friendly faces, air conditioning, water, brownies, pastries, fruit, and a lovely imam, who told us about the activities in the center and answered our questions.It was a lovely, hot, red-faced, sweaty time, partly on sidewalks, partly on the Constitution Trail, partly on the grass by the side of the road on Gill Street, and I wanted to jump into the pond with the sprinkler in it, but I consoled myself with the thought of Early Bird Lap Swim. And Poet beer. (Not really. I just made that up when I found this picture of my bottle bush, formerly a burning bush, but it died. I hope not from hanging bottles on it! It's growing back, finally, in various places near where it used to be, and also far from where it used to be. How does that happen?) And great conversations with Unitarians along the way...."},

I let that go.And I wasn't really a slattern on my Saturday (Slattern Day in the blog)! I did the physical labor, and then I brought all my desk work outside, after a stint on the computer, posting the latest theatre review by Scott Klavan and selecting fantastic New York photographs by Frederic Bourret for it at Escape Into Life.Outside, I was reading poetry, Echo, by Christina Lovin, toward a review; re-reading The Language Archive, a play by Julia Cho, toward a fall production; and writing, always writing. Some of it was note-taking. For instance, I noted from a poem in The New Yorker, \"Kale,\" by Jordan Davis, the exact gardening information needed by my friend Kristi in Michigan: \"If you cut a butterfly bush / down to nothing, it grows back / the next year twice as high.\" (I must remember to send that to her, or maybe she'll read it in this blog!) I love learning stuff from poems.Yes, I love the way I live now. And it's also a Random Coinciday, as the latest book review up at EIL, by Seana Graham, is about The Way We Live Now, by Anthony Trollope. That's one I saw first in its film version, as a fabulous mini-series. I hope I get to read it some day, perhaps in some down time. Watching the series, I felt the terrible pertinence to our times noted by Graham in her book review. Sigh.... It's as if we're Trapped in the Mirror, the title of this photo by Bourret!And I love this bench, titled The Seat of the Soul.

Kids can handle that better, though, and I feel sort ofbrain-crunched. So I stop and breathe deeply. Or go outside.How does your work differ from other writers in your genre?It differs in essential and particular ways and is similar in essential anduniversal ways. Someday, when I’m safely dead, I hope some fine, subtle,compassionate, loving scholar will compare me to Emily Dickinson. (Because I am her lovechild with Walt Whitman.)Why do you write?I grew up reading, soit’s a natural extension of my being, like a teasel blossom on the top of myhead. I write poems about everything, so I’m sort of like an invasive roadsideweed.Here I am as a happyteasel, saying, “I got a poem published today in Heron Tree!”When I’m dead and all dried up, you canuse me to raise the nap on cloth, or remove pet hair from your coat.What is your writing process?It varies with the poemor project, but I start by paying attention. I see something. Then, when some words come, the next ones can arisefrom those. They might get revised or cut, but they at least got somethinggoing. My husband paints this way, too—putting something on the canvas (or hunkof board or drywall) and seeing what can happen next while still coming back tosome original impulse, purpose, feeling, or mood. If it doesn’t work, if itdoesn’t come alive, we start over, orpaint over it; he gets richness and layering that way, colors underneath, and Ithink I do, too, even if the eventual poem turns out spare. It can have powerfrom the unspoken.One way I “test” myprocess, as to its soundness, is to notice how it compares with the process ofother artists and other creative, thoughtful people like scientists. And itdoes. Scientists often start by noticing something and then pursue it with curiosityand fine instruments. Sometimes they are problem solving, and sometimes so amI.But sometimes I am justteaseling you."},

I think it's because I sense the troubles around me even when my own lucky life continues untroubled. For instance, our former mayor died on Monday, Carol Reitan, and this was a shock and a sorrow. (I had just read about her entire public life, researching a script I wrote for an event coming up in June, where she will be honored as a History Maker by our local history museum, and was so looking forward to seeing her at the event. And now, suddenly, she is history.) On Sunday, as I spent a pleasant Mother's Day with my kids and my mom, my pastor's younger brother died at 47 from a massive heart attack, leaving a wife and two young sons. And, oh, the Nigerian girls!I don't ignore this vague internal woe, because I've learned from experience to be attentive to it and let it be, but I try not to get weighed down by it, a stone on the chest while floating downstream.Today's poet at Escape Into Life, Lauren Gordon, and accompanying artist, Brianna Angelakis, are helping me with this at the moment. Gordon's poem \"A Short Marriage\" contains these lines:We ignored our internal tigers,left with no other choice.And bleaknesswhich settles into your gums,makes your teeth shiver.Brrr.

There is a place for cheery, sentimental, rhyming, greeting-card verse on Mother's Day, and that place is a greeting card. (Although the one you'll get is currently blank, Mom. I do hope to fill it in with lovey-dovey but probably not rhyming words.) At EIL, you'll see poets handle grief, rage, the choice to be or not to be a mother, and the choice to stick around. I confess I walked out the back door once, frustrated by mothering, but it was only to walk around the block for fresh air and to blow off steam. Literal steam, from boiling rice... (And the kid was safe, and supervised, but only after my desperate, frustrated, repeated efforts to get the two men in the house, who were not cooking, to watch the toddler. Sigh... Steam...)

It's lovely, and won the Booker Prize in 1997, but it was tough to read. It's nonlinear--or non-sequential--in structure, so we are folding back and forth in time. It does have suspense, even though we keep being told who will die and what has happened, and the reason for this came home to me in Chapter 12, Kochu Thomban, named for an elephant the children love, and all about the traditional kathakali dancers. Now, an elephant is not a small thing, but that even comes up in this chapter! \"He wasn't Kochu Thomban any more. His tusks had grown. He was Vellya Thomban now. The Big Tusker.\" The children come of age in this story, too. With much woe.But the nonlinear structure was addressed when Rahel, the narrator, steps into the temple to watch the Kathakali Man dance. \"It didn't matter that the story had begun, because kathakali discovered long ago that the secret of Great Stories is that they have no secrets. The Great Stories are the ones you have heard and want to hear again. The ones you can enter anywhere and inhabit comfortably. They don't deceive you with thrills and trick endings. They don't surprise you with the unforeseen.\"That reminds me of something Flannery O'Connor said about her own stories, that it would be best for you to know from the start that somebody will die, so you can be watching for the meaning all the way through, how the people behave, watching for the why and how, not the \"who done it\" aspect. I do read Flannery O'Connor over and over. Of course, I'm usually not very comfortable in her stories--often I am laughing and half-horrified at the same time. I guess that was true in The God of Small Things, too.Back to Arundhati Roy: \"In the Great Stories you know who lives, who dies, who finds love,who doesn't And yet you want to know again. That is their mystery and their magic.\" Yes.I was also moved by the description and plight of the Kathakali Man, who is \"the most beautiful of men. Because his body is his soul. His only instrument.\" He is trained in his art since childhood, knows what he will grow up to be, is very skilled, and cannot be or do anything else, even though the times are changing, and his art is no longer respected in the way it was before, not even by his children, who are wrapped up in lives of commerce, not art. \"But he himself, left dangling somewhere between heaven and earth, cannot do what they do.\" He is part of a particular time and place--Kerala, India in decades of great change, late 1960s to early 1990s--and part of History with a capital \"H,\" which, in the story, powerfully disrupts the lives of individuals.But he also shows us the plight of the consummate artist, \"dangling somewhere between heaven and earth,\" unable to do anything else, whose \"body is [his/her] soul.\" Ah, but don't the great spiritual teachers tell us the same thing?Speaking of small things, here are some very short reviews, in haiku form, of 4 chapbooks, posted at Escape Into Life, with more art by Simen Johan, whose mammoth, owls, boy, and hill of bugs you see here."},

So, yay!But we had a worry: the health of our wonderful WGLT radio host and poetry lover, Bruce Bergethon. My wonderful dad, a radio man from way back before he was a theatre professor, filled in for Bruce and did a great job!This morning I got up at 4:30 to make sure Scott got to the airport on time for his flight back to Portland, and I am pooped.

The ice is melting into winter lemonade all around me. I hear the polar vortex is returning, but it don't worry me, it don't worry me...(another song, from Nashville, sung by Barbara Harris.) You may say that I ain't free, but I would guess that I probably am, in some deep, important ways.I've been pondering some deep, important things while 1) re-reading short stories by Alice Munro and Lorrie Moore (wise, compassionate, hilarious, sad) and 2) continuing to read Team of Rivals by Doris Kearns Goodwin. Goodwin tells us that Lincoln went to the theatre a lot, finding it a marvelous stress release during the Civil War. Of course, that last visit to the theatre was fatal, but in the meantime he found joy! This makes me feel OK about my love of movies!And in the amazing story \"Free Radicals,\" by Alice Munro, she gives us a character who loves to read and to re-read, especially the classics. (I re-read, too, and re-watch movies, to see what I learn this time around. The Bruce Willis character utters something about re-interpretation of movies in Twelve Monkeys, I might add, having just re-watched and re-interpreted that. I have a happier take on the ending now.)  Back to Munro:She would pick one up [a classic], thinking that she would just read that special bit--and find herself unable to stop until the whole thing was redigested. She read modern fiction too. Always fiction. She hated to hear the word \"escape\" used about fiction. She might have argued, not just playfully, that it was real life that was the escape. But this was too important to argue about.I understand this and connect to it. In \"real life,\" so many people wear masks and costumes, don't they? They imitate conventions, they celebrate \"re-inventing yourself,\" etc. In fiction, people are what they are and quietly or dramatically deal with their problems, and authors create a context in which we learn more about the \"why\" and the \"how\" of their lives and struggles. Fiction broadens and deepens my compassion for the people around me in real life, while the behaviors of people in real life don't reveal much of their real life to me. A paradox. An irony.I was recently reminded that Elbert Hubbard was the one who said the lemon/lemonade thing, in an obituary for an actor. Others used and varied it afterward.

{"title": "Still Happy", "date": "Wednesday, February 19, 2014", "text": "On Blue Monday in the blog, I needed to get happy, and, thanks to some sunshine and Pink Martini, I am still happy. Also, Pink Martini notwithstanding, yesterday was National Drink Wine Day, so I did not have a pink martini, nor any other kind of martini. (But Diane Keaton did, with French music in the background, in Something's Got to Give, which I watched again in order to stay happy. Once again, I adored the crying-laughing-writing montage in that fun movie.)Anyhoo, what I meant to say was 1) you can make your own collage at the Pink Martini website and 2) I love the song \"Je ne t'aime plus (I don't love you anymore),\" sung by China Forbes and Philippe Katerine and written by them over several years--1997-2013. They sing in French, but the translated lyrics include such romantic lines as \"And I think that you are fat / And I know that you are bald / And I think that I don't love you anymore.\" Don't worry, as 1) there's a context: \"I am angry with you tonight / Because you told me that I belong to you\" and 2) like Something's Got to Give, it's got a happy ending.But, speaking of hair, please go read \"Girls with Moustaches\" and \"'I Wish My Dad Had Hair'\" and other poems by Yvonne Zipter, up today at Escape Into Life, with fabulous art, some of which you also see here, by Sean Mahan. Zipter's poems are sweet and funny but also elegiac, and today calls for an elegy. Our community has lost another theatre person, and a masterful singer, Phil Shaw. There is sadness in town today, and fond memories. And fading sunshine.Here's an Origami Girl.Now go make your own collage.And/or arrange buttons into a beautiful flower.And stay happy."},

Anyhoo, I thought, \"I know that voice!\"Sure enough, it was her.It is her smile, isn't it, that makes her so beautiful. The light coming from her, an openness.Phyllis Diller was on my mind, since I recently read We Killed: The Rise of Women in American Comedy, by Yael Kohen, which reminded me that many funny women also sang. Wikipedia told me about Diller's actual background in piano. And the Pink Martini notes (on the back of Polaroids) told me \"Smile\" was her last recording. Oh, thank you, Pink Martini, and thank you, too, for the song \"Get Happy,\" done in Judy Garland & Barbra Streisand style, that is, together with \"Happy Days are Here Again,\" but here it's China Forbes and Rufus Wainwright. (I do like him, even though he whines.) Thank you because I needed to get happy (hunks of snow still and again falling, together with ice pellets, another duet) and the song was over the top and I burst into tears! But I got happy.

The Sparrow stands alone,but readers asked her to keep going.**Despiteits awkward title, this is one of my faves by Munro. (I recommend any book ofher short stories; I haven’t read her two most recent books yet, so I shouldread those in 2014!)***Idiscovered Zenna Henderson in 1972 when I was living in London, though she wasfrom Tucson, Arizona. I was in my science fiction phase of adolescence andmissing the USA. While I usually read “literary” fiction or mainstream fiction,I love that I have science fiction at the top and the bottom of my list, whichcame out in no particular order! Just favorites over time. Ilove short stories, so I also recommend Eudora Welty, Flannery O’Connor, andEdith Wharton, but above I was going for mostly contemporary writers. In thelist above, the books by Strout, Munro, Henderson, and Lahiri are short stories(linked stories in Olive Kitteridge andin The People series, separatevolumes or collected). I’ve read a jillion novels by Anne Tyler. I love her forher compassion and natural storytelling. Try Breathing Lessons, too. TheAccidental Tourist. MaybeI’ll do a separate list of books of poetry by women, or two lists—recommendedand on a personal “to read” list. Likewise, I should do a “to read” listconnected to 1) book group and/or 2) ambitious reading plans for 2014. One ofmy ambitions is to finish Team of Rivals,by Doris Kearns Goodwin. I love it,it’s just long!Ido recommend other books by these authors, and perhaps I shouldn’t have putMarilynne Robinson in there three times, but her works really stick with me. Gilead and Home are novels that look at the same community and characters fromdifferent perspectives, at a quiet, steady pace in a rich and thoughtful prosestyle. The Death of Adam showsRobinson’s profundity as a thinker and her scholarship. She is a great writerof our time."},

{"title": "Farewell to Art", "date": "Sunday, February 9, 2014", "text": "We said goodbye to Art White, a sweet man, on Saturday, at a lovely service with New Covenant Community at the Campus Religious Center in Normal. He died at home on Tuesday, in hospice care. It was good to hear his family, friends, and colleagues speak of him--with laughter and tears. He was \"a peach of a man,\" a thinker, a seeker, and, later in life, a poet! He wrote his first poem in a poetry workshop of mine, and I got to read it at his service, along with one of his favorites, \"Stopping By Woods on a Snowy Evening,\" by Robert Frost. Art used to call me up and recite \"Stopping by Woods\" to me, or to my phone machine if I wasn't home. \"And miles to go before I sleep.\" No more miles to go.At the service, we learned that Art drank Scotch with some friends, bourbon with others, and sometimes martinis, which reminded me that he had taken me out for a martini once! Wooee! (It's a little odd to forget a martini date...  Or is it?) And with some pals he drank coffee or tea. I held hands with my dad (bourbon) during part of the service, and then he went up and spoke, too. Art hired my dad at Illinois State University. The whole past washed over us yesterday....and again today in church, on the 50th anniversary of the Beatles, when Russ the pianist played \"Yesterday.\" Sigh....The past washed over me in various ways this weekend. I judged individual events and performance-in-the-round at a regional speech tournament, and I was on speech team back in high school. My mom was my speech coach! What sweetness, joy, talent, and intelligence I saw in these young performers!Meanwhile, my husband had taken his team of 7th graders to a volleyball tournament up north. I'd had a chance to see them play Thursday and Friday. More joy, talent, and spirit!And, to make it a Random Coinciday in the blog, I received the next theatre review from Scott Klavan in New York this weekend, and posted it tonight at Escape Into Life. Scott reviews Bronx Bombers at Circle in the Square, a baseball dream play, and his review is also a thoughtful essay on sports vs. theatre in terms of 1) the human condition 2) commercial success. I like the background idea that being braver about the human condition might actually lead to greater commercial success.These crows belong to John Wentz, the wonderful artist who also accompanies the theatre review at Escape Into Life."},

Because this particular winter's not a feeble one. The art by Chris Ballantyne is gorgeous and scary at once, you'll see!Well, you can see a bit of it above. We have white roofs around here, and our own roof has a drift like a curling wave on it--a surfer's wave, or Camille Claudel's wave. It's all quite wondrous. But there's been a wave of grief, too. All around me, friends are losing their fathers.

Right now their clustered buds stand on three straight stems that resemble weird green eye stalks.But these camellias are by Jonathan Koch. And the lemony and the citrusy lantana have been blooming happily in their hanging pots, so I am cheered, though, today, unable to convince myself to go outside. I had promised myself (and others) to mail things, and I still do have time tomorrow, when it will be a little warmer, before the snow arrives around noon.So I've been doing indoor editing chores today, work I love. And I finished A Gate at the Stairs, by Lorrie Moore, a writer I love. She can be hilarious, though this is a serious one. With hilarity in the background in the justifiably witty prose style.January has been hard. Good things in it, yes.

I found it via the Best American Poetry Blog, its \"Hump Day Highlights,\" which led to PA (aka PoetsArtists), edited by Didi Menendez, and an interview by Grace Cavalieri with Linda Lee Bukowski, the poet's widow, conducted for PoetsArtists back when it was called Oranges & Sardines. What a roundabout journey! (By chance, I am also interviewed in the new PA, with 3 of the Claudel poems attached. As you know, I love chance.) I love the simplicity and quiet, funny sorrow of the Bukowski poem. I see the leaves. I hear the landlady.The interview reveals a bit of the tragedy of the roots, Bukowski's sad childhood. Hence, my favorite turnip, by Jonathan Koch, who also painted the tangelo and its bright leaves. And if you need some more brightness, as I did this week, here is a review of Jannett Highfill's chapbook, A Constitution of Silence (Green Fuse Poetic Arts, 2013), in the EIL Blog, containing 2 of her subtle sonnets. \"Scintillation\" contains pictures of fantastic light installations by Lee Eunyeol.

Camille Claudel knew herself and once said, \"Of the dream that was my life, this is the nightmare,\" and we saw that nightmare onstage, as well as the joyful dream. I hope it's OK to show you these production photos by John Ray, so you can see a bit of the \"fever vision,\" too.What a privilege and joy to have been part of this art collaboration! You could feel the excitement during and after every performance. One woman wept uncontrollably after the show on opening night. Others gathered in the lobby, eagerly discussing Claudel and Rodin or vowing to learn more. Dance students praised the dancers. Area musicians hailed the return of members of Carpe Diem String Quartet who live now in Washington and Colorado but reunited for this.My sister's colleagues from Otterbein University got to see her rich, gorgeous depiction of the older Claudel, turned to gold in the asylum where she lived the last 30 years of her life. It was a \"Wowie wow wow wow!\" event, as Junie B. Jones would say. Here is Chris as Claudel confronting (in memory and dance) Rose Beuret, Rodin's early model and mistress, then common law wife. The costumes, by Liz Hopkin, were amazing, evoking period clothing and marble purity, as needed. Turns out Liz was inspired to become an art historian by the works of Camille Claudel! How lucky she also became a costumer in time for Claudel at CDT!I did remember to pack shoes for this trip to Ohio!But I failed to pack boots. And there was a lot of snow.

{"title": "Wounded Niobid", "date": "Thursday, January 16, 2014", "text": "Tuesday was a two-interview day, and today is a three-poem day. On Tuesday morning,* I was interviewed by The Columbus Dispatch about the upcoming production of Claudel at Columbus Dance Theatre, in the intimate Fisher Theatre. (Last year's Cleopatra was in the larger Lincoln Theatre, with its very appropriate Egyptian ornamentation.) What an unexpected delight in life, the chance to work closely and in a variety of ways with a dance company!I had the occasion to spell the word \"Niobid\" for the reporter, and I had learned what it means--a child of Niobe--in my research on Claudel. Now this poem, \"Wounded Niobid,\" appears in Electica, with two others written in the voice of Camille Claudel, who sometimes inhabits the voice of a character in her sculpture. In this case, there's a doubleness; pierced in the heart, she feels her connection to a daughter of Niobe.As the poem details, sometimes Camille Claudel, like other sculptors, re-used figures from one sculpture in another. The Wounded Niobid is the female figure from Sakuntala, who leans on her lover in a reconciliation scene in that grouping.Like me, Camille Claudel loved the water. Swimming was good exercise for her, but she also liked walking, despite a mild limp. I appreciate the coincidence of her \"clay foot,\" as she was noted for her fine skills modeling hands and feet in clay while a student of August Rodin.And I love The Wave, her sculpture of three women under a huge wave that might overwhelm them. She was a fan of Japanese art, so I imagine the wave in Japan. If the women are lost, 1) first they had that glorious rush of water 2) they are like the children of Niobe, who all perished, as punishment for their mother's pride in them.Looking forward to reading the whole issue of Eclectica, and I've already read the short short \"Consensus\" by Laurence Klavan, who makes it a marvelous Random Coinciday by being the twin brother of Escape Into Life theatre reviewer Scott Klavan, who claims he's much better looking.

So, I hope you'll check out Trying to Fly at her website or ReverbNation, etc.I got to hear her live once, at the Encyclopedia Show in Chicago, and she was lovely. Wrote about it here. So it's a good Hump of the Week for me.It's also a Random Coinciday. Today is Martin Luther King, Jr.'s real birthday, even though we get next Monday off. (And also my mom's!) This morning I opened the newly received Poetry East (Numbers 80&81,Fall, 2013) to this epigraph by Martin Luther King, Jr.:What, then, is the answer? The answer lies in our willing acceptance of unwanted and unfortunate circumstances even as we still cling to a radiant hope, our acceptance of finite disappointment even as we adhere to infinite hope. This is not the grim, bitter acceptance of the fatalist, but the achievement found in Jeremiah's words, \"This is a grief, and I must bear it.\"I heard this, of course, in the context of social justice, but also in the personal context. The first poem in the issue, directly following the King quotation, is a long narrative poem by Michael Hettich, recounting the loss of their first child (\"unwanted and unfortunate circumstances\" of a home birth). I'd read his poems about this before, but not in such detail, nor from such distance, the distance of 30 years, which collapsed into the astonished woe of memory. One of the songs on Trying to Fly, \"Jennie Wise,\" has a sad story of this kind, too. Alas.And I heard the \"radiant hope\" and \"willing acceptance\" of Emily Dickinson, or any struggling artist not in denial who understands the patient woe of the unsung. Someone of her patience and strength and courage could indeed take on that knowledge.So, I wish you radiant hope."},

I am tickled, and this makes it a Poetry Someday in the blog, as well.The cover is based on Camille Claudel's famous sculpture, The Waltz. And here's a link to information on Columbus Dance Theatre and its upcoming production of Claudel, a world premiere. Plus, Juliette Binoche stars in a new film about her, Camille Claudel 1915, that I hope to see when it comes, but accounts of it do match much of my research and interpretation of her life. Looking forward to a busy January of dance and film!Poems from the book appear now in Arsenic Lobster, Heron Tree, and Fickle Muses (see links in list to the right) and are forthcoming in Eclectica, Menacing Hedge, and Wicked Alice. Thanks so much for your interest and support if you look for the poems and order the book!"},

I hope I have an epiphany tomorrow.My husband used to get his presents, in his shoes, tomorrow, January 6, on Three Kings Day. We expect to be snowed in tomorrow, or homebound due to bitter cold and the windchill factor, and since we did not hoard groceries in advance, I hope I have enough imagination to make meals from what's at hand.The traditional food would be a cake with a bean and a pea in it. I have some beans. Or I could bake a King Cake with a baby Jesus in it. Not happening.Instead, I offer this interesting account of Twelfth Night, or What You Will, Shakespeare's play performed as it would have been, in Shakespeare's time, with men playing all the roles. It's a production of Shakespeare's Globe in a limited run at The Belasco Theatre in New York, starring Mark Rylance and Stephen Fry. I'd love to see it.I was in Twelfth Night in college, as Olivia, and in Chicago, with the Steppenwolf Second Company (doing Shakespeare for school groups), as Viola. I was a better Olivia. I'd been instructed in a convoluted rationale just to speak in my regular voice, as a boy would have been playing Viola/Cesario before his voice changed, but I'm not very deep-voiced naturally, so it could hardly have worked. Sigh... Plus my twin (Sebastian) was way taller. I think back on what would have been the more natural casting and wonder why we didn't do that!Oh, well. I got to play two cool Shakespearean roles + all the women, at one point or another, in A Midsummer Night's Dream, not to mention a variety of fairies. What a nice life."},

What is happening?!Well, the going up and down stairs part has certainly kept me nice and warm. We had a lovely holiday woliday with family wamily and friends. I hope you did, too. On New Year’s Eve, we tookour annual short trip to Michigan to a house in the woods where we park our carat the foot of the drive because it won’t make it up without slipping back ortipping into the ravine. It acquired about a foot of snow on top, as did thedeck furniture out the window! We celebrated with old friends and young dogs. We used every single white card and every single black card in the Cards AgainstHumanity deck and laughed till we cried. We’d been drinking a champagne toast onceper hour from 8:00 p.m. on but still almost forgot to turn on the tv and seethe ball drop at midnight. Almost, but fortunately the kitchen clock was fiveminutes fast!While it was snowing, thenew issue of Arsenic Lobster came outwith 2 of my Camille Claudel poems in it, “Collage” (which means glue*) and “Working Small.” It’s a wonderful issue with a wonderful introduction. Many thanks to Arsenic Lobster editor, Susan Yount, andto Jonathan Koch for Scissors, Thread,Tailor’s Tape, the painting above.Thanks to Kristi and Alex for the New Year's pix, including pix of their dogs, Lucy and Archie.**Happy New Year!*I did not glue my fingers together on Christmas gifts this year.**And the lion shall lie down with the dog.Hmm, what's that I smell?

{"title": "No Zumba For You", "date": "Saturday, December 21, 2013", "text": "Remember this guy? He isyelling at me. On Slattern Day in the blog. With a sheet of ice out there onthe roads. We heard a prediction of “five inches of ice.” How could that evenhappen? (Don’t tell me! There are things I don’t want to know.) Well, the less-than-five-inchsheet of ice caused me to go around the block and come home this morning,instead of continuing on to my last zumba class of the season. I was glad Icould stop at the stop sign and turn into the proper lane, and my own driveway.On my way around theblock, part of my introverted mind (the neocortex, or “new brain”) was firmlyattentive to the road and the brakes. But part of it was also spinning titlesfor this blog entry. The first, before I realized just how slick it was, was “ReZumbaed”(meaning “zumba, resumed.\") Yes, I know. Not very funny. And strangelyconvoluted, also probably due to my essential introversion. I am reading Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a WorldThat Can’t Stop Talking, by Susan Cain. I feel so externally validated! So comforted,so relieved. Anyhoo, that was when I thought I was resuming zumba this morning.This quickly changed to “Re:Zumba,”as in “regarding the matter of zumba,” just as quickly discarded.  “Zumba: Epic Fail” skated by, but I didn’twant to imply the failure of zumba itself, only my personal epic fail. And then“No Zumba For You” reared its ugly head behind a deli counter in my mind, viathe “Soup Nazi” from Seinfeld.So, yes, I did not make itto zumba class this morning. Nor did I make it to the special, extra, holidayzumba class offered to Saturday participants this past Thursday, which wouldhave allowed me to make up one of the other classes I failed (or forgot) to attend.But I forgot. Instead, I was making adreaded Christmas shopping trip to Target, a store I haven’t visited in over ayear, I’d guess. So, of course, I go there when Target shoppers have had theircredit cards hacked. Fortunately, I just missed the hacking period. I hope. Itis the season of hope, right?Little did I know, when Iwrote of my “Slow Waltz” yesterday that I would be going so slowly down the literalroad this morning.  Not, thank goodness,figuratively waltzing on my half-new tires. So, I will “Rezumba Quiet” (heh heh) this morning, on my couch, maybe, wrapped in a cuddly sherpa (blanket,not a guy from Nepal). It’s the shortest day of the year, so I might be thereall day. I can write Christmas cards from inside a sherpa, right? And it's the longest night ofthe year. Here is some more to read, Re: Winter Solstice, at Escape Into Life, excerpts from thejournals of Chris Al-Aswad, founding editor, and from a book he was reading, The Happiness Hypothesis. More stuffabout how the brain works.I mention snow angels.Around here it might be mud angels, as it’s been raining. Or sheet of iceangels. Or Sherpa angels."},

I proofed galleys for Interior Sculpture: poems in the voice of Camille Claudel, forthcoming in January from dancing girl press. I think the cover will play with this famous sculpture of hers, The Waltz. This is a chapbook of poems written for the dance collaboration, Claudel, 20 poems, of which Columbus Dance Theatre will enact 15. Many thanks to Kristy Bowen for choosing the manuscript, designing the cover, and living with the crazy timing! She also took 3 of the Claudel poems for Wicked Alice, an elegant thing.

And here again is the poem, that retells the legend in the voice of Sakuntala but also in the voice of Claudel, whose lover made her a promise he could not keep.This and other poems will be spoken by my sister, an actress in Columbus, and performed by Columbus Dance Theatre, with new music by Korine Fujiwara of the Carpe Diem String Quartet in January. You can imagine what a thrill this is for me! Here's the Claudel sculpture, and Wes Kroninger took the photo of the CDT dancers!And here, at Escape Into Life, is another sculpture, a stone bride, her visions captured in songs by Nicolette Wong, in her chapbook Stone Bride Madrigals. I reviewed it in the form of a cento taken from bits of all eleven poems in the book. That was also a thrill. David Heg took the photo for the book cover."},

Both are based on the life and work of sculptor Camille Claudel. \"Red Umbrella\" incorporates a sort of legend about herself, based on local gossip that she escaped her room at night by way of a red umbrella. \"Sakuntala\" is the story of Sakuntala, spelled various ways, rejected by and reunited with her lover, from Hindu culture. Claudel created a beautiful, tender sculpture of Sakuntala, the recognition scene.It's been difficult to blog lately--due to fun things, like being busy with kids home for the weekend, but also because of limited connectivity issues with the fickle Internet. (Probably the modem. Sigh...) So, if you don't hear from me, 1) I've been kicked off the Internet 2) I'm stuck in a snowdrift 3) I threw my back out shoveling snow 4) I am lost in the freezing fog... 5) I am out (or at the window) gazing at the glorious full moon!But, surely, I'll be back."},

Needed to clear it so hubby could get off to volleyball practice and kids could get out for their planned Christmas shopping trip. Both kids are home--son for the weekend, daughter for winter break + boyfriend--and I got a good workout.Last week, instead of zumba...I forgot. The week before that, I was in Missouri for Thanksgiving. I am failing at zumba. I think next Saturday is my last class. I hope I make it.These wonderful celebrity-inserted-into-famous-painting images are thanks to 22 Words, Worth 1000, and my old theatre pal Julia, via Facebook. They are fun, funny, and sometimes a wee bit frightening. They also reveal some problems with proportions. Isn't Steve Carrell's head too big?It's Slattern Day in the blog, and I've also failed at that, I guess, by neatening up the driveway. Shoveling snow is a lot like zumba but without the music. The world was white and silent when I was out, very early. I felt like Scarlett Johannson with more clothes on. It's the flowy white resemblance of the snow I'm talking about here. I somehow entered the landscape. (Once again, I am yearning for red hair.) My husband was out a bit, too, but that was to throw an old volleyball at the snow-laden mugo pine to knock snow off a branch that was so laden it had leaned into the power line to the house.He did it! Without getting electrocuted or knocking out the power! You see I am focused on the positive today. Even the silly. It's a way to keep joy in the heart when bad things happen. So is Love Actually, which I have seen this holiday season and would be happy to see again, as needed. Yet to see: It's a Wonderful Life. And now I'm also in the mood for Space Jam.Speaking of Love Actually, here is Rowan Atkinson as Jean-Paul Marat being assassinated in a painting by Jacques-Louis David, via Worth 1000. I have a dark, dark sense of humor that gets me through a lot. Now I'll go write a few Christmas cards, but not in the bath. Even though he does look strangely cheerful."},

It's up to current code, the opening is wider than normal, and the quilt rack can easily topple over if he just kicks it.Yes, usually we hang stockings not tangerines, or in this case mandarins, as in the painting Satsuma Mandarin with Insects, by Jonathan Koch.

{"title": "Insidious Karma", "date": "Wednesday, December 11, 2013", "text": "OK, was it yesterday's weensy bit of snark that caused this morning's electronic glitch, or what? I don't really think things work that way, but I do think karma can be insidious, an ambush from within, in a perfectly reasonable way beyond superstition. I also think we can interpret our dreams the way we might interpret poems, looking for what's there and asking why, and how the evidence links up toward meaning, or paradox. Our dreams are in our own heads! We can figure them out by looking closely.What's all this adding up to? Well, this morning I posted the new poetry feature at Escape Into Life--Matthew Murrey--and emailed the poet to check it out and let me know if there were any problems. When I got back from a business meeting, he'd answered that only 3 lines of the first poem appeared in the post. How awful, and how embarrassing (for me...I hope he was OK!)Anyhoo, I don't know what happened, nor why comments are turned off on that post, but I did figure out how to restore the missing text, images, bio, and link by returning to a previously saved version and re-saving and publishing that. Whew!Was it a wack attack on our site? Was it some glitch caused by the \"limited connectivity\" message I keep getting today on my home computer? Is the Internet overloaded by online holiday shopping? OR did my grinchy spirit in yesterday's post and my self-righteous-sounding complaints against snark in the Sound of Music posts leading up to that collide to screw up my online karma? I'll never know, unless I can figure out how to fold up my origami brain into a cootie catcher in order to re-ask those questions.Speaking of \"insidious karma,\" that is a phrase in my poem \"Learning Simple Things #5\" up this month in the wonderful Redheaded Stepchild, \"a home for rejected poems.\" The poem is based on a wonderful whimsical but ultimately scary pastel drawing of a fanciful forest by John Cassidy. His whole show was about learning simple things, and I keep learning them over and over. I don't have his images, but I can show you these wonderful Samuel Jan images from Escape Into Life.And speaking of interpreting dreams, I had a sad one this morning about losing my shiny bicycle, which was, at first, in parts, then reassembled and whole, then stolen. I wept in the dream, already interpreting, and woke still doing both. Then the Internet ate my post, and now I am peeking out at a rhino from under an umbrella.

That is a real thing! I mean, I had heardof it before, as a music-making technique, and even tried it, the playing of water in glasses bytouching the rims, but there was also a musical instrument based on thattechnique, and, of course, Benjamin Franklin designed one. Yes,the glass harmonica (aka armonica, from the Italian word for harmony).Actually,as the Wikipedia article explains, the glass harmonica was based on what wascalled the glass harp, the arrangement of wine glasses filled with varyingamounts of liquid. So, “Gracie Lou Freebush” aka Gracie Hart aka Sandra Bullockis actually playing the glass harp, but I was tickled to find the glassharmonica.ANDto learn that the glass harmonica was the instrument used in the mad scene ofthe opera Lucia di Lammermoor that gives us the beautiful aria sung by DivaPlavalaguna (pictured above) in The Fifth Element. I love The Fifth Element.It is funny, inspiring, and has that song in it. I replay it over and over tohear opera singer Inva Mula sing, and watch the blue alien played by Frenchactress Maïwen le Besco move her lips and dance. Director Luc Besson had hoped to use thevoice of Maria Callas for the Lucia di Lammermoor aria, but older recordingswere not pure enough, so instead we got the pure voice of Inva Mula!Somehowthis all relates to Carrie Underwood and Julie Andrews and Marni Nixon singingfor Natalie Wood (in West Side Story)and Audrey Hepburn (in My Fair Lady)and Deborah Kerr (in The King and I)and that acting vs singing swirling controversy (see Snarkado), and somehow itdoesn’t. It just relates to my joy in hearing beautiful singing and finding outcool information. Forinstance, how lovely to learn that Marni Nixon played Sister Sophia in the 1965film of The Sound of Music! SinceJulie Andrews could sing for herself! Hence, so could Marni! Finally.Anddo you know what else? Playing the glass harmonica was supposedly hard on thedelicate nervous system. You could go a little mad playing it, or getmelancholy (or lead poisoning). But healthy Ben Franklin called its sound “incomparablysweet.” LikeKirstin Dunst, dressed as Marie Antoinette. Because you know who else playedthe glass harmonica? Uh huh."},

Let it go, people!Imagine all the pressure she was under while preparing for this event. And while doing it! And, if we want to be cynical, snarky, and mean, we might vent about the commercials, specially designed to sell stuff at Walmart, including the CD.Anyway, watching The Sound of Music made me 1) play songs on the piano from the vocal score, recently obtained for 25 cents at the WGLT Recycled Music Sale 2) want to see the movie again, to watch Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer fall unrealistically in love according to the conventions of musical comedy 3) recall the joy of Mary Martin singing on the vinyl album. Now there's a good \"Lonely Goatherd\"!But, while I prefer to get lost in the story and songs when watching musicals, I imagine the at-home and online commentary was lots fun for some, maybe as much fun as what must have gone along with Sharknado during its airings on the Syfy channel this summer. When I first heard the word \"sharknado,\" I had no idea it was a real thing, meaning a real movie, as clearly a waterspout leaving man-eating sharks on the ground is not a real thing. Is it? Anyhoo, the sequel is on its way.Speaking of Christopher Plummer, I loved seeing Amanda Plummer in Catching Fire.Many thanks to Wikipedia for the beautiful white funnel cloud on the blue sky of northern Texas, a public domain image, and to Justin1569 at en.wikipedia for the scary tornado touching ground in Manitoba, a GNU Free Documentation Licensed image.And I've been doing this snarknado swirl instead of dusting my house because it's Slattern Day."},

Which reminds me, the host for Thanksgiving this year has asked straight out that no one discuss religion or politics. It's such good advice, and hardly anyone takes it. But she's asked, so I hope everyone will honor her wishes! I'd be grateful for that."},

Those guys did a great job. I love my town. I went out to thank the guys, and they said we did it right, making it easy for them. The trunk still stands, and now Tony wants to carve it into a totem pole. (Hmm, will the town allow that? We have seen numerous wood sculptures in front yards around here...!)How about this great art by Nigel Cox? The humans are so solid and real, the landscapes so surreal, and the shadows so precise, calling it all into question. This art seemed perfect to pair with Dave Awl's poems today at Escape Into Life, letters and \"night diaries.\" Poems that create relationship even as they expose solitude. Just like the paintings! I love my job. My labor of love poetry job.Today's sky, at this moment, looks like the floating sky in Nigel Cox's painting, The Pilgrim, a boy with a backpack. It's a day of \"intermittent clouds,\" as my smart phone tells me. (It is so much smarter than I am.) The intermittent clouds alternate with sunshine, making things golden and blue for a while. My brain is also intermittent today. I think I was in the middle of folding warm clothes when the bulldozer claw noise arrived, pulling me to the upstairs window...Yes, and there's more laundry to do, and to fold. And so I will walk away, but not in these beautiful red shoes, and not in this beautiful Basque dress. Sigh...."},

Today my husband and I worked in the sunshine chopping up the snapped pine tree in the yard, and taking down the remaining branches. Trunk and roots will have to wait for another day and heftier equipment. We have hunks of firewood, branches ready for the city to take to its compost heap, and the Christmas tree--the top of the pine, saved for this purpose, to honor it.Some of you know that I leave the Christmas tree up for rather too long, but only when it is artificial. This one is up early and will go down early, too, by necessity, I imagine. But it is so fresh and smells so good that I think it will make it to Christmas. If not, we will have loved it for a while longer.Meanwhile, the neighbor's tree still lies fallen in the back yard, most of its leaves still on it--yellow, red, and green! It's beautiful, too, but we are worn out for today, and don't know where to put it, so fallen it will remain. (We hope to hear from our remote neighbor eventually, but we don't mind the large presence in our yard for now!)Heart goes out to those in Washington, Illinois and East Peoria and many communities in the Midwest hit so hard by the storms. Heart still out, hovering, in the Philippines. Our hearts hover together, a cloud of love and sympathy, that sometimes rains down some practical help.

Illinois was hit hard with the bad storms that hurried across the country yesterday.A pine tree snapped in two in our front yard, and our neighbor's tree fell over into our back yard, crushing the fence. But we are fine and feel twice-blessed, as something similar happened (and at a similar tree-to-fence-to-yard angle) some years ago at a house in Chicago! That time, the tree narrowly missed a second-floor back bedroom where my husband was working. This time, my husband had just come in from cleaning the gutters (realizing while he was on the roof that this was a really bad storm) and was looking out the patio doors into the back yard when the tree fell into it. I was in the church basement, where we had gathered when the alert came through via cellphone (and did you know that a cellphone can have \"Assisted Light\" on it, a very bright flashlight?! Well, now I do!). We cheerfully continued our fellowship and then went home to our various messes and power outages, glad to be alive.A poem of mine went up at Heron Tree, and I found it there this morning. And I found this heron landing on a tree at birding information. The poem is about a tree. A sweetgum tree! We have one in the back yard, and the neighbor's tree missed it as well as the house. Today we put out more leaves for the leaf-sucking machines, creating room on the median for branches. Tomorrow, perhaps, we begin chopping up the pine tree. Today, I made a wreath with some of its branches.And, if you didn't see these already, take a look at William Lemke's photographs of trees at Escape Into Life."},

See how they are like nostalgia? And see how they are linked by melancholy longing? And you know I am of a melancholy nature! And that I love words.Anyway, I used both words in this review of Darling Hands, Darling Tongue, by Sally Rosen Kindred, a chapbook that revisits Neverland and its inhabitants and visitors, Peter Pan, Tinker Bell, Tiger Lily, Wendy and her brothers, and the Lost Boys.Here is another \"lost boy,\" missing Naples in Saudadesde Nápoles, by Bertha Worms.

Today, Collagemama, a wonderful, whimsical blogger in Texas who often comments here, sent me this picture of nuns on the train. (She was responding to yesterday's post, Nuns on the Bus.) The painting, called The Chair Car, is by Williamson Gerald [Jerry] Bywaters, an artist from Paris, Texas.Paris, Texas is a real town and a film (that was not filmed in Paris, Texas.) This summer the Nuns on the Bus went to Houston, Dallas, Austin, San Antonio, Laredo, and El Paso, Texas, but not Paris, Texas. And many other cities and towns across the U.S.A.Talking about social justice.Sister Simone Campbell, one of the nuns on the bus (not on the train), led worship today at New Covenant Community, and it was a packed church! She was inspiring, reverent, down to earth, and fun. She explained the loaves and fishes--the miracle was sharing (the women had packed food, of course). She mentioned stomach acid, in regard to St. Paul's epistle on the metaphor of the body of Christ. She advocated talking to people in the line at the grocery store. And she read more of her poems to us.Plus, remember wallpaper? She talked about wallpaper! Remember \"in a lonely place\"? Well, she spoke of being \"in this lonely place\" of life on earth and the need for community, for radical acceptance and love. It all made sense, and I had that lovely weird feeling of everything being pertinent, everything coming together in a delightfully unexpected way.Which, I admit, is how I often feel. It was just nice to get that Nuns on the Bus bump."},

She was a guest on The Colbert Report and got the \"Colbert bump.\" Or vice versa, as I'm sure Stephen Colbert would agree! As she explained in her talk last night, she and her fellow \"nuns on the bus\" probably got the Vatican bump--by annoying the Vatican. And when the Vatican draws attention to your cause, you get noticed.The nuns on the bus (who vary all along the route) were on a cross-country journey, literally by bus, to share their message about the issues of economic justice, immigration reform, peace, and affordable healthcare.You can read more about these and other causes they support, including ecology, here on the Issues page of the Network website. Network itself is a national Catholic social justice lobby.Here is Sister Simone speaking to students yesterday at Illinois Wesleyan. You can hear her tomorrow at New Covenant at 10:30, 210 W.

Our son had visited, too, so while we were driving south he was driving north, back to his apartment in Chicago. We were all under a clear sky on a beautiful starry night. Bright and early the next morning, our daughter went to class, our son went to work, and we parents were empty nesters again, on a Blue Monday in the blog. But grateful and oh, so glad for the joy of the visit, the beauty of the night.Our kids were tickled that we, their parents, had a date night planned for Saturday. While they went off to Gravity at the local movie theatre, we went to hear Iris Dement sing at the Bloomington Center for Performing Arts. She's a songwriter in the country and folk traditions, who has sung with John Prine, Ralph Stanley, Steve Earle, and Emmylou Harris, among others, and I first saw her on, of all things, the Conan O'Brien show, probably back in 1994. She invited him over for Thanksgiving.She sings with a high, plaintive wail, piercing at times, in mountain style. Not everybody likes it. She writes a lot of sad songs. Ditto. But some of them reveal her great capacity for joy and acceptance. I connect. \"My Life\" is one of my favorite songs of all times. She sang that and \"Easy's Gettin' Harder Every Day,\" which she somehow hilariously described as being as low as you can get, and \"Our Town,\" and a bunch of the new ones. I loved the contrast of her gentle humor and sad content, sewn together with the thread of her fierce honesty.I think she was blonde when I saw her on Conan, but she was a redhead in the concert and in this picture from a 2007 gig, by Ron Baker (shared via Creative Commons). Also enjoyed her in Songcatcher, a sweet film with Janet McTeer and Aidan Quinn about collecting songs in Appalchia. Yes, I have the soundtrack!I have two of her albums, Infamous Angel and My Life, and there's a new one out now, Sing the Delta. You can see all of her album covers here, at her website.  I'm going to be playing Iris Dement while I cook for the next couple of weeks, you bet."},

The professional wallpaper stripper and installer has left this one patch because it is problematic; it's on a different surface than the rest of the wall and won't come off without doing damage. She'll solve this problem.But she won't do a small job, a patch, in a house where my husband is doing repair work so the owners can put their house on the market. So my husband had to do it. And you can't just patch the one trouble area (he had fixed a hole in the wall). You have to re-do the whole strip in the area affected. Sigh...  Poor him.And poor me, sensitive wallflower, on a hopeless search for a patch of birds, a sample of the vintage wallpaper with birds and their names, to show you, dear readers. For one thing, \"wallpaper\" means something else these days; for another, some would consider this particular pattern, er, better off left in the past.I did, of course, find the home decor kind of wallpaper, samples of which you see here.

I wore my inside shoes (only for gym floors) and used my inside voice (no energetic yelps from me). If I survive Saturday morning classes, I may add weekday classes. Until I can swim again outdoors!Today I took a walk on the trail--warm, breezy, sunny, beautiful smells, the fall leaves. Then, since it's been cold already, I did my transplanting into pots to bring indoors: white geranium, heirloom Martha Washington geranium (two-toned purple and magenta), yellow snapdragon, and a bit of balsam already sprouted from seeds that dropped in late summer. Birds are here to eat the rest of the seeds, balsam and morning glory.Above is Joe Tiernan's harvest moon, shared at Facebook (so I hope it is OK to share here). Some say the harvest moon is in September, but really it depends on the timing of the harvest. It could, in October, be the hunter's moon, but Joe was visiting Polyface Farm, and I think he knows his moons, and his harvests from his hunts. I've seen this kind of moon, this low and huge and golden, before. I saw it tonight, high up and white, emerged from the mist, between branches. I love the moon. Though man has walked on it, it never lost its romance for me.Speaking of the past (moon landing, dead poets), I have a poem about Nebraska in the 1960s in the new issue of Hobble Creek Review.

Hmm,probably I haven’t yet reassured you. As poetry and painting are sister arts, let me just say that Iam married to the perfect man. I am pretty sure you must be married to theperfect woman, and I am glad we both have two children.Ilove you because 1) you are hilarious 2) all that good and silly stuff aboutpoetry in The Anthologist 3) all the good stuff about music and 4) your generousacceptance of human foibles, and I love you in spite of the vague discomfort Ifelt with what I like to call “the hifalutin’ porn” of The Fermata.

You know. The history of love. But it's a novel. So.Another scary thing: I am speaking in lists and sentence fragments. This is probably due to reading too many books simultaneously.I can tell I'm going to like The Anthologist. It's about poetry, and it promises to be hilarious. The narrator is a poet who confesses, on page 2, \"My life is a lie. My career is a joke. I'm a study in failure. Obviously, I'm up in the barn again...\" I'm, you know, identifying.If only we hadn't knocked down the barn.And buried it.True story.

Unexplained fevers are pretty scary.And Seana Graham has reviewed Don't Look Now, a book of stories by Daphne du Maurier that includes that one, which was made into the scariest movie ever.

It's part biography, part literary criticism, and right up my alley, the kind of guy, poet, mythological figure, or angel I wouldn't mind meeting in a dark alley, however scary that might be.

It was a blue sky October day, one that got warmer but which caused us to turn on the furnace in the morning. I was a little blue about being old enough to be cold enough to turn on the furnace on October 14, but then I remembered they turn on the heat lamps on the el platforms in Chicago on October 1, and I was younger when I eagerly awaited that date, shivering on the platform, waiting for the A train. But that, too, shows how old I am, as now it's the Red Line, and the train stops at both A and B stations. (Maybe it's changed again.

I knew I would be too technologically challenged to sort out what my computer had done to mute or block sound, so I asked my son. Other helpful people had advised me to turn on my speakers or turn up the volume. I am not being sarcastic here. I do know that this is often the solution, as is unplugging and re-plugging one's computer when it keeps kicking you off the Internet. Thank you, Al Gore.My son instructed me, by email, to go to Chrome, click the 3 bars in the upper right corner, and clear my browsing history. I had a choice here, about how far back to clear it, and chose From the beginning of time. I found this thrilling as well as alarming, and waited to see if I would actually explode, or just disintegrate little by little.Also, I am reading The Fermata, by Nicholson Baker, about a guy who can stop time. People kept telling me I would love Nicholson Baker, and I saw him interviewed by Stephen Colbert and thought it was time to give him a try. Why did people think I would like a book about a guy who can stop time in order to take off women's shirts? Well, true, they thought I would like The Anthologist, about a poet, which was not on the shelf at the library, and Double Fold: Libraries and the Assault on Paper, a nonfiction book about preserving words on paper, also missing, and I probably will, because I am pretty darned fascinated (and simultaneously alarmed) by The Fermata.So, anyway, just because sound was paused indefinitely on my computer, it didn't mean 3 million other people couldn't hear the delightful daughter of Ben Ames sing \"Tonight You Belong To Me\" to ward off fear of fireworks. They could! I couldn't! Not till I cleared my browsing history From the beginning of time. And now I can. She is very cute.And that, my friends, is a Random Coinciday in the blog."},

That also happened last time, and perhaps the time before!Now, yes, once you get on a dental schedule, aided by electronic calendars at the receptionist's desk and all that, it's reasonable that people might be in dental synchronicity, but this occurred even after my mom had canceled and rescheduled her exam & cleaning! So it's a Random Coinciday in the blog!OK, here's another coincidence. I visited a gallery on our town's First Friday open studios/galleries event last month and really liked these tintypes I saw in the window and on the wall. I asked about the artist, whose name seemed vaguely familiar but whose work I'd not seen before. Then the artist walked in the door, and we were introduced, and he sort of recognized me, but we couldn't figure out where or when.Background music: \"Where or When\" as sung by Ella Fitzgerald.Then, suddenly, me: \"Oh, you're Rashod!\"He was, indeed, Rashod Taylor, who'd been my high school student several years ago when I served as a replacement English teacher for someone who left on short notice. (I was a college teacher but got a temporary teaching certificate that lasted for the 90 days they needed me to teach!) He was in the yearbook class and was a fantastic yearbook photographer. Since then, he's been to Africa and New York City, he's developed his portrait photography skills, and he's gotten interested in some historical photographic techniques, making tintypes and ambrotypes, using the collodion process. You can see a couple here and more at his feature today up at Escape Into Life!In another coincidence, my computer is in slow motion today as I try to show you these rapids by Rashod, so I am going to sign off as soon as I can. But I'd just like to mention that my mother, my daughter, and I are all getting our teeth cleaned on December 26!"},

Here's one of them, the dog star herself! (With equal time for cats below...)Seriously, the dog days are associated with Sirius, the Dog Star, which got its name, Wikipedia tells us, from being the brightest star in the sky (seirious = \"glowing\" or \"scorcher\") and its nickname from being part of the constellation Canis Major (Greater Dog). For the Egyptians, the appearance of Sirius coincided with the flooding of the Nile, a good thing; for the Greeks, it announced the potentially hot, dry days of summer; for lots of us, by now, it has come to be associated with those long, hot, muggy or dry days of summer when even the dogs are too tired to get up. And, as man's best friend in the car, there's Sirius satellite radio.I love the connection of Sirius, the Dog Star, with Isis, the Goddess associated with Cleopatra, a recent obsession of mine!

Here, he looks so earnest as the Drama, Stagecraft, and Junior High Drama teacher, making an important point. I want to thank Nancy Mastalir Ruder for these wonderful photographs, and for sharing the sad news with some of Mr. Mike's former high school students, who loved him. Nancy and I are blogger pals who have never met; she learned of his death here in my blog, and I learned of her connection to Mike that way, too. She lives in Texas, I live in Illinois, and both of us used to live in Nebraska (different towns), which was coincidence enough. Now this.And a sad, sweet remembrance now of Thomas Michael Pullin, known to locals and Heartland Theatre pals as Mike Pullin or Michael Pullin. He told me once, shortly before he died, as it turned out, that no one would know who he was when his obituary appeared, as it would say Thomas. Indeed, the local paper called him Thomas Pullin. But we all knew it was him.And Mike, Michael, E. Mike, or Mr. E. Mike Dobbins, we know it's you who's gone now.  Nice to see you standing on the left, second row, with your Dionysians at Lincoln East High School, Lincoln, Nebraska.Services for Mr. E. Mike Dobbins are August 3 at Calvert Metzler Memorial Home, and you can learn about how to make a memorial donation to Heartland Theatre there or here.I am touched that Mike Dobbins will be buried at Evergreen Memorial Cemetery, where an actor might someday bring him back, laughing, in the Evergreen Cemetery Discovery Walk.

I've been on the phone a lot lately, though usually it's a cell phone, and now I carry a charger around with me, too, and I'm getting good use out of a \"Phoney Pocket\" made by Betty Toland. I do also have a rotary phone like this one, black not red, but it's not off the hook. This just represents the bit of disconnect I feel between my head and my ability to recall the day of the week.Here in the blog, though, it's Slattern Day, and I have an untidy poem up at WGLT's Poetry Radio. Yes, it's called \"Off the Hook,\" and it's about this kind of hook. As usual, in my origami brain, a source of disconnect has led to a kind of re-connect, and the poem is sort of word play wrapped in a fighting song. Brilliant WGLT producer Bruce Bergethon helped me see that by attaching music by Charnett Moffett: \"Haitian Fight Song\" from The Bridge: Solo Bass Works. I love this mad, mad world and its constant connections, though, lately, my origami brain feels a little squashed, like a wad of the newspaper funnies, in color, crunched when somebody sat on it.In my anchoring search for Random Coinciday images, I was pleased to discover, via red phone, the blog of children's writer, poet, and book lover Martha Calderaro. And also Ninja star coat hooks, by Thinkgeek; my son would like these.In addition, these paint brush coat hooks would hang well on the wall of our home (the home of an artist/carpenter), and we have the stiff brushes to prove it. (One, oddly, is in the freezer.)These are created by Dominic Wilcox at Variations on Normal, a pretty irresistible name for this Normal (IL) woman. I hope it's OK to show you his work and link to his site. You can also find him here!"},

But I'll start again tomorrow. Lap swimming!Each thing contains its opposite, doesn't it.My dad is having three-dimensional dreams."},
{"title": "Found Our Way Out", "date": "Tuesday, June 18, 2013", "text": "OK, well, despite being lost in the labyrinthine hospital yesterday, my mom and I found our way out. And so did my dad! (Sort of.) He's being moved to the rehabilitation wing, where they will make him move his limbs till he can get around better and go home. He is quite chipper today, though some crankiness and discouragement are quite understandable when your active lifestyle is, er, clogged by blood clots.There are many Exit signs in the hospital, but, in my recent experience, none of them led to exits I recognized as being also the entrance I'd used coming in. It was a bit like being in a Kafka novel or a play by Jean-Paul Sartre. Yesterday, attempting to exit by way of the elevator I'd come up on, I noticed a wall sign that had not been there the day before.  (\"Twilight Zone\" music.) It clearly showed patient room numbers that included my dad's room number! When I'd come up, for two consecutive days, the only signs showed other room numbers, not those on my dad's hallway. (Minotaur music.) The suddenly-appearing sign had a different font size and a satiny finish, and I thought, \"Gee, that's probably something about expectations and perception, etc., blah blah blah.\" (Really. I say that kind of stuff in my head. And sometimes out loud.)Finally, today, I tied a string to the front door and unrolled it as I went, made easier by all the automatic doors in a hospital. It was tricky going up the elevator, but it's elastic string...Those are actors in Sartre's play, laughing at my silly myth. Anyhoo, I learned that I'd been using a staff-only elevator on my way back, and needed to pass that in order to find the regular elevator and retrace my steps without the aid of mythical elastic string. \"Gee, it's nice not to be going bonkers while my dad's in the hospital and both he and my mom could use a little practical help!\" (Sometimes my brain gets stuck in a feedback loop or an origami fold.)Thanks for all the good vibes.  Evidently, they worked!!"},

My dad had some surgery this morning, and is doing fine, resting, and will no doubt be a good candidate for a quick recovery via physical therapy. His blood clots and baker's cyst are still there, but now he's got a filter that will keep any floating debris from colliding with his heart. So that's good.Every time I go in the hospital, I find his room, Room 241, just fine. Or eventually. It's getting out of the hospital that's the problem. I can't seem to retrace my steps. Or I retrace my mistaken steps many times.True, there's been renovation and new construction. And, yes, some of the staff don't even know how to get from here to there due to the changes. But they all seem to be able to get out!And, though lost in the hospital, I always get out. With help.Meanwhile, I remain a little lost in the space of my head. Today I got maybe two things done, besides lap swimming and visiting my dad and mom. Maybe three. But with a lot of retracing my mental steps."},

He is doing all the right stuff about it: taking it easy, elevating the leg, giving himself shots (er, medication), and going to the doctor. Please send some good vibes to my mom, too, who is doing all this with him.The Cranky Doodle Day part of this post is that he was supposed to leave Saturday for Gambier, Ohio, to attend the Kenyon Playwrights Conference and this looks less and less likely, alas. And darn it.He also couldn't attend last night's History Makers Gala at ISU's Brown Ballroom, a lovely event created by the McLean County Museum of History to 1) honor local people who are making history by living their lives! 2) have a cool way to hold their annual meeting! With food and wine!My dad wrote the script for this event last year, and I wrote it this year. He was part of the initial planning and is responsible for the bells!--but was too busy with directing Middletown at Heartland Theatre to do this year's script. It was great fun and a privilege to be involved this year. Rhys Lovell did a wonderful job directing spirited actors who brought people from the past back to honor people in the present.

That poet was me. Co-inka dink #1!My daughter wandered into the kitchen for breakfast, and, not only does she know this nephew, she just helped him get a job at the restaurant where she works! Co-inka dink #2!As our meeting progressed, my poet pal called to confirm with another poet who'll be involved in the reading. She said a friend of hers has a grandson who just graduated here and was enthusiastic about a poet who'd read at graduation. Co-ink #Mee!I think this may be the biggest moment of my literary career.Speaking of sweet co-inka dinks, yesterday I posted a review of Inksuite, by Sarah J. Sloat, over at Escape Into Life. I love her work--smart, short, often funny poems, and also beautiful, heart-punching poems with indelible images--and this chapbook from dancing girl press is unified in being about typeface and printed matter.

Will it ever get all the way warm this May? May is almost over. Golden columbine and Ohio blue spiderwort are blooming. Pinks are beginning to open--today!

{"title": "Indoor Picnic", "date": "Monday, May 27, 2013", "text": "Happy Memorial Day. Today it'll be an indoor picnic. I'm responsible for the fruit salad. But I've been thinking about alignment, the universe, synchronicity, synchronization, and so on. Thanks to all that, it's a Random Coinciday in the blog. Thanks to the rain, it's a Blue Monday.And real thanks to veterans today. Remembrances to those who have died, veterans of life if not war.And thanks to this NPR story, I've been thinking about synchronicity and alignment via metronomes. I recommend watching these two short videos and reading about how and why they synchronize. We talk about \"good vibrations,\" and I often send \"good vibes\" out into the universe when people ask me for prayers--sort of a thought ripple of hope, rather than wishful thinking addressed to a god figure.Sometimes I talk about realigning myself in the universe, meaning straightening my spine via yoga, but maybe I should reconsider it in view of these metronomes. What am I really asking? Or doing? Am I trying to enter the flow of good vibrations? Or am I seeking some kind of conformity?I'm more of a fruit salad kind of girl. I didn't even notice that the colorful metronomes were all in rows, until...they were synchronized! Once they were, they reminded me of soldiers.On Sunday, the pastor quoted Forrest Gump: \"I don't know if we each have a destiny, or if we're all just floating around accidental-like on a breeze, but I think maybe it's both. Maybe both are happening at the same time.\"I think it's both, too. Some of us chart our lives, and some more evidently float, but we usually don't see the story till we look back. Even if my life is more like the path of a floating feather, it may have hit points in the air that create an invisible constellation. A dot-to-dot picture. A story. With meaning."},

And, um, rejections are rolling in again, but nice ones, saying to send more. And a few acceptances, too!I got a little behind in my poetry book reading & reviewing, but posted a review yesterday of Survivor's Picnic, by Debra Bruce, at Escape Into Life. She has a reading coming up in Chicago on Friday, May 31, with an open mic attached, if you are a poet in that area. (Details at the link.)I do connect summer with summer reading, even though I am not a student or teacher anymore, tied to an academic schedule. I just read Look Me in the Eye, by John Elder Robinson, the teen & tween paperback edition, minus most of the swear words, and learned so much about Asperger's syndome!

My daughter graduated from high school on Saturday, and my son came home to cheer her on. It was a lovely, breezy day--a little hazy in the morning, which kept it comfortable and not too hot, and then the sun came out right when the graduates came out to take pictures with friends and family.Graduation from Normal Community High School used to be a pretty hot, crowded affair in the gym. You could only invite a few people. Now it takes place in a huge coliseum that also accommodates ice hockey, Olympic volleyball, and the Bob Dylan concert we attended a few years ago, with Elvis Costello as the opening act!So a jillion people can attend. Comfortably. High up and all around, with a good view of the proceedings and close-ups provided on a big screen (of which I was blissfully unaware any time a camera was aimed at me, fortunately). Because, by happy chance, I was up there on stage at my daughter's graduation, receiving a Distinguished Alumni award, along with Walt Byerly '48 and Judith Preno Boekholder '60. The awards committee was delighted when they found out my daughter was graduating, and I got to read a poem to her class and hug her when she came up for her diploma!Don't worry. I checked it all out with her beforehand, and she was fine with it. She okayed the poem in advance, too. And her friends liked it. And their families. And that's what matters.Book of the HeartThe wise ones say to know yourself. They’re right.If you don’t learn to know yourself, you mightsomeday wake up in the middle of the nightafraid, unable to get back to sleepand wonder if you lived your life right.But the wise ones, who are many, are very deep.They know already what you keepinside you, like a secret flame:We are all human.  We are the same:hopeful, yearning, timid, if there’s need,bold, courageous, able to succeedat loving one another, if we really try.That’s all that really matters.  You andI,we know that, don’t we?  We learned ithere,in the book of the heart, year after year after year."},

In Chicago, I took public transportation everywhere (& did not own a car) for 20 years. Here, I walked or took the bus to jobs, though it's true that colleagues at one job started picking me up at the bus stop, but, hey, that was carpooling! But for 4 years, I commuted to a job 35 miles down the road, and that used up a lot of gas and emitted a lot of CO2. Sorry. So far, I've logged 14 miles of walking, burned 2128 calories doing it (!?!), and avoided 11.97 pounds in CO2 emissions.Now I mostly work at home, but I am logging my commute to work-related destinations: post office to mail submissions and editing jobs, bank to deposit freelancer checks, poetry readings, etc. I was delighted yesterday to attend a poetry reading by Katy Didden, who read new poems and poems from her book The Glacier's Wake. (Paulette Beete, please notice that her book launch is in D.C. on May 30 at 7:00 p.m. in the Hill Center, Old Naval Hospital! Maybe you can go!)On my way, I noticed many tulips still blooming.

And if you missed yesterday's sprawl of tulips or fleurs de mai, just click those phrases to see more fabulous flower photography by Katinka Matson.

Sometimes these \"secrets\" arise in back story or character study, and sometimes they occur during the rehearsal circumstances.Here's one of mine. Actually more than one. These are book-related secrets. Surprise, surprise.As The Librarian in Middletown, a role I played recently at Heartland Theatre, I lock up the library one evening and head home with my book bag, putting into it two books-in-progress, with bookmarks in them, and keeping out one book that I open and read aloud to the audience. It is, fictionally, Yesteryear in Today's City of Tomorrrow, the story of the history of the settlement of Middletown, back to the Chakmawg Indian days.This was, in fact, an ex-library book, call number on the spine, and I wrote in the margins \"in a bright red pen\" the things the script says are written there: \"anxiety, sickness, death, spiritual,\" and, a few pages later, \"atmosphere.\" I also provided the blue barrette used as a bookmark by the imaginary child reader who wrote those words in the book's margins.The other two books in my book bag were, in fact, books I was in the middle of reading, too intense to continue during the rehearsal and performance process: The Book of Disquiet, by Fernando Pessoa, with a melancholy narrator rather like John Dodge, one of the main characters of Middletown, and When I Was a Child I Read Books, by Marilynne Robinson, chosen by me because it is intelligent, rigorous, has \"child\" and \"books\" in the title, and relates to my attempt to remind a smart, writerly guy, The Mechanic, who he is, was, and will be if he can figure out how to live \"in the middle of all of our different ideas about life.\"The book bag was my AWP Chicago 2012 book bag with red handles that matched my red Converse high tops. Yes, my entire costume was from my own closet, a sort of goofy outfit I have, I hate to confess it, actually worn in real life: blue flower print, um, \"clown\" pants; pale beige button-down shirt; navy blue sweater with beige and brown embroidered fall leaves, plus gold stitching at the edges and random shiny beads; and said red high tops.Costumer secret: The Everyman, Earthmother, and Essential Child characters in the play all wore Converse high tops: black, red, and gray.

Just as I have the Random Coinciday, Cornell had the \"eterniday,\" the one that lingers on forever, extending melancholy into a permanent state in which one wears a bathrobe.Or something like that.I love Joseph Cornell's boxes, his assemblage, and I can't help but love him, an odd man with a love of sweets. Of course lines from the Prologue of Middletown, by Will Eno, seem to apply. Cornell was one of the \"gentle gentle people, infinitely injured, lost souls, ghouls, ghosts, descendants, shades, shadows, future ancestors\" that Eno celebrates in his play, down to the \"last lone dying and inconsolably lonely person\" lying on his couch on Utopia Parkway.

It's the last weekend of the show, coming up after 3 much-needed restful days off, with real spring outside, yellow tulips blooming, white bleeding heart, lavender creeping phlox.Last night I watched Finding Neverland again, with Johnny Depp and Kate Winslet, and that sweet, sweet boy, but I fell asleep...."},
{"title": "Poetry Tarot", "date": "Wednesday, April 24, 2013", "text": "I love these poetry tarot cards created by Susan Yount, up now at Escape Into Life in a new poems-about-poetry feature in the ongoing celebration of National Poetry Month in April. Walt Whitman is gorgeous as The Sun. And look how the golden orb transforms into the moon with Lucille Clifton as The Empress and a sort of halo around Federico Garcia Lorca as The High Priest.More cards here, with captions. Just keep clicking \"Older Posts\" and eventually you'll find Charles Bukowski as the Devil. And so on. And Emily Dickinson as Death, of course, here.With butterflies.I've called this mini-anthology \"Joy in Transgression\" to honor Yount's duende process, from Lorca, her personal \"high priest\" in art, using the word \"transgress\" to mean \"crossing a boundary,\" as well as the idea of \"transgression\" as disobedience or sin, as we poets are so often told not to write poems about poetry.But we do! I hope you'll enjoy the poems. You can click on each poet's name to find more of her or his work at EIL. There's even a poem by me, a further transgression. But, hey, I was a contributing poet at Escape Into Life before I was an editor there, so I guess it's not so bad. But it does cross a boundary!Hey, I think that's me in the background, leaning on my elbow."},

{"title": "What We Witness", "date": "Tuesday, March 19, 2013", "text": "Today, a sunny one, driving home from exercise class in my Scatter Joy baseball hat with a good brim, I witnessed what was nearly a disaster. This is to calm you in advance, to scatter joy (weal, instead of woe). As I came up to the train tracks, the signal lights began flashing, and the striped bars came down. I saw the light of the engine car as the passenger train approached the crossing.And then, on the slight hillside beside the tracks, a man in a black winter coat walked straight toward the tracks, and on them, running a little as he touched the ties. The train was slowing and stopped.The man was in black, not orange, like one of the manual signal workers, and not near the signal at all. He seemed a pedestrian, but in those few moments in which I leaned forward in fear for him, gasping, he was a potential suicide. I was feeling for the driver, too, wondering if his heart stopped. There was no awful screeching of brakes. The brakes had already been applied. But still...A door opened, and a conductor stood there for a while, looking. He was too far away for me to tell if he was concerned, or talking to the man in black. Or what.Then the lights stopped flashing, and the bars went up. It was safe to cross the tracks in our cars, and the train would pull into the station a little while later. Once home, I listened for and heard the horn.I told my husband all about it, and he listened patiently, as a priest listens to confession. We've been dealing with a suicide that touched the family. Our hearts are open.Then, eating my delayed brunch, I read a short story in the December issue of The Sun, something I had somehow missed when it arrived. \"A Good Idea,\" by Craig Hartglass, about one man saving another from suicide. That wasn't a spoiler; you'll know right away. You can read it here.What a great name, \"Hartglass.\" Like a glass heart. Or a glass hart."},
{"title": "More Weal, More Woe", "date": "Monday, March 18, 2013", "text": "I had the pleasure on Sunday to meet with a couple people to discuss poetry--and this was on top of the pleasure of having my son home for the weekend! There was plenty of family wamily conversation at meals, cuddle time, giggle time, serious planning. It all connects, because there is what can be said and what can't be said. With family, it, the ineffable, is conveyed through love and hope and small services we perform for one another. With poets, we know we are engaged in the activity of expressing the inexpressible.Or, as Marilynne Robinson would say, about all kinds of serious reading and writing, we are engaged in \"demonstrations of the extraordinary power of language to evoke a reality beyond its grasp, to evoke a sense of what cannot be said.\" Yes, I am still reading and loving her book of essays, When I Was a Child I Read Books. A little later in her essay called \"Imagination and Community,\" she says, \"We live on a little island of the articulable, which we tend to mistake for reality itself.\" That seems so often and so clearly true to me.It's like that picture of the iceberg, used to illustrate what goes on in the theatre, just to articulate a play to an audience.Here's something she says to which I powerfully, viscerally, connect: \"I seem to know by intuition a great deal that I cannot find words for, and to enlarge the field of my intuition every time I fail again to find these words. That is to say, the unnamed is overwhelmingly present and real for me.\"I feel this way all the time now--overwhelmed and thus tremulous and fragile in the world--but also floating on a sea of awe, my natural home. Since there is so much I sense but cannot articulate to others, I sometimes feel adrift (see iceberg), disconnected from the major land mass, endangered, and, perhaps, perceived as dangerous (again, see iceberg), but I am not intending to wreck any ships, and, by the way, I am in the process of melting.It is reassuring to read Robinson's provisional definition of community: \"I would say, for the moment, that community, at least community larger than the immediate family, consists very largely of imaginative love for people we do not know or whom we know very slightly. This thesis may be influenced by the fact that I have spent literal years of my life lovingly absorbed in the thoughts and perceptions of--who knows it better than I?--people who do not exist...I think fiction may be, whatever else, an exercise in the capacity for imaginative love, or sympathy, or identification.\" Robinson is a fiction writer, in addition to being an essayist, professor, and great reader, steeped in all kinds of knowledge. She knows that her community includes characters she has created in books, met in books, and, of course, all the authors of those books, most of them now dead.I, too, belong in her community. \"I love the writers of my thousand books,\" says Robinson:\"It pleases me to think how astonished old Homer, whoever he was, would be to find his epics on the shelf of such an unimaginable being as myself, in the middle of an unrumored continent. I love the large minority of writers of the writers on my shelves who have struggled with words and thoughts and, by my lights, have lost the struggle. All together they are my community, the creators of the very idea of books, poetry, and extended narratives, and of the amazing human conversation that has taken place across millennia, through weal and woe, over the heads of interest and utility.\"In the context of the essay, \"interest and utility\" cover the day-to-day practicalities, commerce, self interest, and such small-group interests of politics and business as usual that have contributed to \"[t]he cultural disaster called 'dumbing down,' which swept through every significant American institution and grossly impoverished civic and religious life, [and which] was and is the result of the obsessive devaluing of the lives that happen to pass on this swath of continent.\" If, for example, education is seen only as the creation of workers, we have devalued education and also ourselves. It makes me sad. I feel, in my gut, the woe.But then I read, I laugh, and I am inspired again. (I'd like to show you an image of Homer Simpson here, saying, \"D'oh!\" but I don't own the copyright.)"},

(Was.)OK, hold your horses. Back up, start over, go slowly, in linear fashion, calmly. OK, so, yesterday, quoting Marilynne Robinson, I wrote the phrase \"weal and woe.\" I made sure \"weal\" meant what I thought it meant in that context, not a red welt but the public good, as in the commonwealth. A care for all, generosity through awareness, and prosperity or good stuff, as opposed to \"woe.\"So far, so good.Today, I pursued it a little further, discovering Weal and Woe in Garveloch, political fiction by Harriet Martineau, from her Illustrations of Political Economy, which you can read via the Online Library of Liberty. (I gather it is more successful as an \"illustration of political economy\" than as fiction, which reminds me of my synoptic major in Poetry and Politicial Philosophy at Kenyon College, and thesis projects for it involving Shakespeare, Shaw, and Emily Dickinson. But I meander.)That Harriet Martineau was quite a woman!Anyhoo, The Weal and Woe is also the name of a band that just produced The One to Blame, an album full of \"[g]orgeously harmony-driven oldschool honkytonk and 1950s style proto-rockabilly sounds,\" to quote their website quoting the New York Music Daily blog's praise of it.

In Robinson, it is given a name, a context in literature, and a buoying calm: \"lacrimae rerum, the tears in things.\" She is citing Virgil, the Aeneid, and reminding us that the ancients saw, knew, and intuited so much. Why do we ever reduce or dismiss them?So I am still reading Pessoa, experiencing his tenderness alongside his sadness in Lisbon, but now I am feeling uplifted, comforted, and calmed by Robinson, who remains remarkably afloat on a sea of tears, even in the face of our potential destruction from the unintended consequences of our actions. Which the ancients took on, repeatedly, in literature. New threats: bacteria, nuclear fission; old source: human nature, hubris.Meanwhile, there's a new poetry feature up today at Escape Into Life, which references good old Walt Whitman, author of Leaves of Grass, singer of \"Song of Myself.\" Laura Madeline Wiseman has continued to imagine him in poetry and in love. Beautiful photos there and here by Sebastien Tabuteaud.I read a lot of science, and my husband is educating himself on quantum physics. This morning, I read to him from Robinson's books of essays:\"Having read recently that there are more neurons in the human brain than there are stars in the Milky Way, and having read any number of times that the human brain is the most complex object known to exist in the universe, and that the mind is not identical with the brain but is more mysterious still, it seems to me this astonishing nexus of the self, so uniquely elegant and capable, merits a name that would indicate a difference in kind from the ontological run of things, and for my purposes \"soul\" would do nicely.\"I have a feeling Walt Whitman would have liked Marilynne Robinson, so \"elegant and capable\" a soul. She continues, later in the paragraph: \"At this point of dynamic convergence, call it self or call it soul, questions of right and wrong are weighed, love is felt, guilt and loss are suffered. And, over time, formation occurs, for weal or woe, governed in large part by that unaccountable capacity for self-awareness.\"That's self-awareness, not self-consciousness (in a negative sense), nor self-absorption. Self-awareness takes its place among other humans, being generously aware of them, too.Pessoa felt his alienation. Whitman felt his connection, though one of a kind. Hmm."},

Come on over at 7:30 for ¡Fiesta,Forever! ¡A Celebration in Poetry!   Poets in the community are reading poems composed in response to objects and information in the current exhibit on Mexican popular arts. The museum exhibit is set up like a tourist visit if you could travel through time, getting your passport stamped in every region, seeing colorful stuff and learning a lot about history, pottery, handicrafts, stone, the Mayans, and Catholic saints as you go! Free, fun, colorful, cultural.Thanks to the museum for the graphic, Country Financial for helping to sponsor the exhibit, and Richard Bartz for the ducks."},

What a thrill!All this week we've been celebrating March as Women's History Month and today as the arrival of International Women's Day over at Escape Into Life. Today there's a sort of Whitman's sampler of lines from poems by 13 women who live all over the world writing poetry. Several live in the USA but have a heritage from elsewhere, and several live elsewhere but came from the USA; it's an amazing array of women writing in English who live in Australia, Mexico, New Mexico, Germany, Norway, Austria, etc.The fragments of poems make up a sort of collage, and there is collage art by Ashley Blanton, who is cutting and pasting and inking on pages from old books. You can find more of her work at her website, Paper Doll Parts. I love the sweet ironies in all this. And the taste of iron in blood."},

And I've been listening to The Blue Room, the newest CD from Madeleine Peyroux. Hits the spot! I love her gorgeous slow, easy voice and choice of songs. On this one, I'm drawn to \"Born to Lose\" and \"You Don't Know Me,\" and last night I wept to her rendition of \"Gentle On My Mind.\" Not because of the car. Just because the song is sweet and sad and lovely.I'm still reading The Book of Disquiet by Fernando Pessoa. Also waiting on a patient stack: Where Good Swimmers Drown, by Susan Elbe, winner of the Concrete Wolf chapbook contest, and Survivors' Picnic, by Debra Bruce, both poetry books, both a little blue-sounding (and making it a Blue Monday on a Thor's Day in the blog). For instance, here's a very short poem by Debra Bruce:Her Ex Sits Next To HerIt's far too soon for her to make a joke of it,scuttle him away with a swish of wit,This is a love seat, isn't it?but too late to reach across the child-size spacebetween them, or look directly at his face.Good stuff, that. I'll be able to read and review Survivors' Picnic for Escape Into Life, because Debra Bruce is one of our EIL poets, so more on that later!In the meantime, everything is gentle on my mind."},

Gabriel of Austria, writing about Austrian physicist Lise Meitner (later a Swedish citizen), Jeannine Hall Gailey writing about Austrian-American movie star and mathematician Hedy Lamarr, and Ren Powell, currently of Norway, writing about Cuban revolutionary Haydee Santamaria. With photos of sculpture by Petah Coyne.The various photos of interesting peafowl here, um, all male, since they are the fancy ones, are thanks to posters sharing images at Wikipedia. The amazing white peacock is from the uploader Abdominator. This peacock feather, which reminds me of decorative feathers in my childhood home, is thanks to Schnobby. (Here's looking at you, bird.)Here's another wonderful peacock on display, thanks to Jebulon. These birds are so amazing, but also so annoying, I hear--from Flannery O'Connor and Joan Didion, to mention a couple women writers! Didion's husband threw things at the screaming birds, I just read in The Year of Magical Thinking.Ah, yes, it's a Random Coinciday in the blog, a Poetry Someday, and the Hump of the Week.

{"title": "Magical Thinking", "date": "Tuesday, March 5, 2013", "text": "I've just read The Year of Magical Thinking, by Joan Didion. It's about grieving and coping and going a little crazy (just part of the grieving) the year after her husband died. Fascinating and beautifully written book. In it is a passage about geology that relates to \"the grand indifference of the stars\" in Fernando Pessoa's Book of Disquiet, which I am still reading, mentioned in a past blog entry.Here's Didion:\"As a child I thought a great deal about meaninglessness, which seemed at the time the most prominent negative feature on the horizon. After a few years of failing to find meaning in the more commonly recommended venues I learned that I could find it in geology, so I did. This in turn enabled me to find meaning in the Episcopal litany, most acutely in the words as it was in the beginning, is now and ever shall be, world without end, which I interpreted as a literal description of the constant changing of the earth, the unending erosion of the shores and mountains, the inexorable shifting of the geological structures that could throw up mountains and islands and could just as reliably take them away. I found earthquakes, even when I was in them, deeply satisfying, abruptly revealed evidence of the scheme in action. That the scheme could destroy the works of man might be a personal regret but remained, in the larger picture I had come to recognize, a matter of abiding indifference. No eye was on the sparrow. No one was watching me. As it was in the beginning, is now and ever shall be, world without end.\"This gets at my sense of things, how science and whatever the soul is co-exist. What is, is, as the Buddhists say. And as I say, frequently, in conversation.Sometimes with myself. What a comfort to read, in this Paris Review interview, that Joan Didion is, essentially, talking to herself, too! \"Are you conscious of the reader as you write?\" asks the interviewer, Linda Kuehl. \"Do you write listening to the reader listening to you?\"\"Obviously I listen to the reader,\" Didion answers, in her usual smart, blunt way, \"but the only reader I hear is me. I am always writing to myself.\"Thanks to Joan Didion for her acute insights and to Facebook for \"talking to Myself....\""},

Cheerleading is another great way to keep warm.Many thanks to Wikipedia for its public domain image of the common hazel and to Tony the Tiger for three hazelnuts (aka filberts), skin-on, skin-off, and halved.

{"title": "Dis-Quieted", "date": "Thursday, February 28, 2013", "text": "I live a pretty quiet life. And I read a lot. Right now I am reading The Book of Disquiet, by Fernando Pessoa, as part of a research project and because I kept hearing good things about it, namely from poet Sarah J. Sloat, at her beautiful, quiet blog, the rain in my purse.Yesterday I wrote about the meditative silence of an art piece in Chicago, a soundscape called Prairie. Today I write about \"disquiet,\" or an unsettled, anxious feeling, a lack of peace. But I feel perfectly at peace reading Pessoa, whose narrator goes back and forth between tenderness for his everyday life and the uneasy sense of its utter meaninglessness.\"I feel love for all of this, perhaps because I have nothing else to love or perhaps too, because even though nothing truly merits the love of any soul, if, out of sentiment, we must give it, I might just as well lavish it on the smallness of an inkwell as on the grand indifference of the stars.\"Recently, I came to the disquieting conclusion that I trust the indifferent universe more than I trust most individuals. The universe makes no promises to me, suggests nothing but indifference. Individuals, on the other hand,...And speaking of inkwells and Sarah J. Sloat, she has a new chapbook out, Inksuite, from dancing girl press, cover art by Emmanuel Polanco. Poems about typefaces and books and reading.So this is a day of book covers. My son saw The Book of Disquiet sitting (quietly) on my desk and wanted to read it, based on its cover.  The butterflies and swirlies are silver, shiny. The gray and black are matte. Ah, shiny vs lackluster. It fits."},

Talent, grace, silence. The only sounds, in addition to clicking and whirring of the exhibit, were the padding and running of feet, breathing, and sometimes the dancers' hands slapping their bodies.And here's poet and artist Alice George walking through the Prairie created by her husband!"},

Where you can find a recipe for cranberry granola bars and see entrepreneurial moms at work.2) Granola 2 Glam. Where you can find a sneak peak, pix, and instructions for making a fabulous Happy Keyboard with washi tape, whatever that is.Just found out. Washi tape is decorative semi-transparent Japanese masking tape. Much prettier and more delicate than duct tape, but just as useful!You can buy some here, at Cute Tape (\"where cuteness sticks\") or on Etsy.

Yes,it’s a Blue Monday.So far it is working:1) The sun came out. I did not know drinking beer could dothat!2) Mardi Gras is tomorrow. Yes, beer drinking causes lineartime. Blue Monday will be followed by Fat Tuesday, not only in the blog but inthe religious/drinking calendar of many people.3) I solved my printer cartridge problem. Shandy, you’re suredandy!4) The Pope resigned. I think I know what he’s giving up forLent, and it’s not shandy!Really,* I know beer did not cause any of these things tohappen. But sometimes I find life a tad confusing and technology more than atad. For instance, yesterday, my poems were looking weak, very weak, when I printed them out. I’mtalking ink here, not artistry or meaning or craft, because, you know, thatwould be devastating and require another beer.*MaybeSo I changed the black inkjet printer cartridge. No help.The poems looked just as faint as before. Must be a dud cartridge, I thought,resorting to logic.**  So I tried again—openedanother box, tried another brand (as in Office Depot brand) new (as in recycledreconstructed) printer cartridge, just like before. I know someone will saythat doing the same thing and expecting a different result is the definition ofinsanity, but that is not supposed to apply to printer cartridges you just tookout of the box. Am I right? (See logic, above. And crippling self doubt,below.)**True, it might have been quantum physics rearranging realityvia crippling self doubt.Anyhoo, I have learned from experience (and Scarlett O'Hara) to set any technologyproblems aside for a day and to solve them the next morning. [Pause to explain thatI did not have beer for breakfast. We are in a flashback back-story part ofthis blog narrative.] [Also, I know full well that Scarlett O'Hara did not avail herself of printer cartridges, recycled or not. But on with my shandy tale!]So today, Blue Monday, I took all of my old and new printercartridges back to Office Depot to recycle them and get some new ones, with thewacko color printouts proving the absence or weakness of colors in the cartridges,and the great guy there was very honest and said the reconstructed cartridgesonly work 50% of the time and to stick with the brand name cartridges, heremeaning Hewlett Packard. So I did. This would have been pretty annoying except forthe joy of 1) honesty in commerce and 2) full refund applied to the newpurchase!I celebrated with a) very strong, dark poems b) very light,refreshing citrus and berry beer!"},

So today we had a wonderful reflection, and slide show, on how the hand is like the wing, etc., plus dinosaurs.The dinosaur above is made of balloons.It was interesting to hear our presenter, Tasha Dunn, say, \"Birds are dinosaurs,\" as if it were what we had always known, even while acknowledging that we've only known that for about 20 years. That is, she's younger than I am, getting her graduate degree during the time of this new knowledge and teaching students growing up inside a certain worldview. I grew up inside a previous worldview but in a century that similarly privileged scientific knowledge as the truth (even when it changes). It's an interesting tension.Meanwhile, the new interview in The Sun magazine, with biologist Rupert Sheldrake, warns about science becoming too dogmatic!But I don't think we'll get too dogmatic in our under-standing, thanks to Tasha's fine musical-comedy take on her topic, today titled, \"Elongated Fingers That Turn Into Wings--These Are a Few of My Favorite Things.\" And, as I understand it, though I might not be able to spell it, Tasha and her partner may have written new lyrics to another Julie Andrews song, newly titled, \"Supraacetabularybipedalicmotion.\"Which is, I think, how we humans walk.Thanks to Wikimedia Commons for the picture of Julie Andrews singing to a dinosaur."},

Also, the pouring rain.It reminded me of this poem, first published in Willow Review.Fog at NightIn fog, at night, the whole world closes over, nothing behind in the rear view mirror,nothing ahead beyond the dome of streetlight mist.It’s possible to live an entire lifethis way, closed in the vehicle of bodybehind the gray-draped hospital room curtains of fog.To drift in and out of awarenessor move in a cushion of fear,wishing vaguely for two red brake lights to appear ahead.Those lights could come uptoo suddenly, layered in a funhouse of mirrors.It could be too late to stop.They could be the devil’s eyes, winking.The devil might come with his legion of red-eyed angels—laughing, the tow-truck, screaming, the ambulance.No use imagining the worst.In fog, at night, it’s possible to get all the green lightson the beltway home.To take the curve gently,at reduced speed, sometimes lit by headlightscoming up behind, benevolent as guardian angels,and to believe in such things."},
{"title": "Still Howling, Still Weeping", "date": "Sunday, January 27, 2013", "text": "Today I finished The Bay of Noon, by Shirley Hazzard, because I could not put it down. It was cold outside, and I was wrapped in a sherpa (cozy, very soft couch blankie, a Christmas gift), lost in the world of love and Naples and fine, fine writing, acute observation of human nature, humans still traumatized after a war (as humans always are, since we keep warring). Shirley Hazzard is a genius, and I wept.And tonight is the official (by some calendars) full Wolf Moon. I hope we can still see it through cloud clover, when it rises, as it's raining.By chance, I heard the tail end of a RadioLab story, Paul Auster (of Winter Journal, Smoke, Lulu on the Bridge, etc.) talking about how we can't know our story as we move forward, only as we look back, which seems obvious yet turns out to be subtle and miraculous. I've mentioned some of Auster's screenplays here because one of the characters in The Bay of Noon is a filmmaker and another a screenplay writer. This book was first published in 1970, though I am only reading it now, as Picador put it back in print, no doubt because it was up for the Lost Booker Prize in 2010. It has Naples in the foreground, Mt. Vesuvius necessarily and prominently in the background.Not everyone will like this book, or its kind, but I do. And today, a Random Coinciday in the blog, I connect it to Paul Auster, saying we can't know the narrative of our lives till we look back on it and see it making sense, and to a reflection on water that I heard this morning. Here's Hazzard on the search for water (and sense-making narrative):\"We are like those early explorers of Australia who died of thirst on expeditions to the dead centre of a continent, always thinking they must come ultimately to water--to an inland sea, to a lake, a river, a cascade. Deceived by salt deposits, by rivers that flow inland, by the fossils of seashells, they were driven on by incredulity as well--by disbelief that one could come so far without drawing nearer to what one sought.\"There's more, but I've spent enough tears; there are salt deposits on my cheeks. I am a perpetual seeker, and to know this is sometimes very hard."},

I've already encountered half of what's mentioned in the NPR account, and I'm only on page 13. Hmm. But I am gripped, maybe because I am so cold, wrapped in a scarf and various sweaters. It's winter in the Midwest.The other journal--I titled this \"Winter Journals\"--is my new red leather heart-stamped diary, 30% off Valentine's-Day-related items* at Barnes & Noble, the coupon waiting in my email this morning, found just after coming to the last page of my previous diary. So it's a Random Coinciday in the blog.To celebrate, uh, besides buying a new journal with a fine discount, I will say that I forgot to mention, in Meetings, that I found out about Jack Schwarz, my most recent poet at Escape Into Life, thanks to meeting in person his daughter Hannah when I was working on Cleopatra in Ohio in November!

A brainstorm meeting for an upcoming writing project, to which I am taking my \"brainstorm notes,\" and a meeting of my book group: we read The Book Thief, by Markus Zuzak. Normally, I don't much like meetings, but these should be good.Here are some meetings of pages, via spiral notebook spine, in the art of Tifenn Python, paired with Jack Schwarz in the new poetry feature up today at Escape Into Life. I like how I know when an artist is \"the one\" to pair with a poet in my fantabulous job as poetry editor. It's different every time, but it's some wonderful meeting of poem and art, some set of coincidences. Here, the doubleness of page in the notebook art did something, the mix of animal parts, the mix of words and images.And that the word \"python\" appears in one of the poems!Schwarz is writing about Susan Sontag writing about art, so there's a doubleness in that. In the love poems, there are two people, an \"I\" and a \"you.\" There are meetings of text and image, of mind and heart, of criticism and creation. And Jack is the father of Hannah Stephenson, featured earlier at Escape Into Life, with the wonderful multiple images of Claudia Rogge, some of which also use writing & image.And if you don't like art or poetry, you still might want to click on Jack Schwarz's feature because he looks a little like George Clooney, or, as Jack himself says, like \"a cross between Paul Newman, George Clooney, and Steve Buscemi.\" What's not to like?"},

My sister played Cleopatra this weekend in a marvelous spectacle, a dance theatre version of Shakespeare's Antony and Cleopatra, a production of Columbus Dance Theatre, at the restored Lincoln Theatre in Columbus, Ohio. The interior of the Lincoln is itself spectacular in Egyptian Revival style.All text was Shake-speare, pulled to the essential story in scenes with Cleopatra. The rest of the story was told in dance and video projected onto a huge screen, with costumes and painted columns dropped in on panels, and so much to look at. The asps were danced by lithe children.My sister is magnificent.Here she is, not too happy with the messenger and his news that Antony is remarried in Rome.And here is Dancing Antony, aloft! The dancing Antony and Cleopatra were a husband-wife team, and so were the talking Antony and Cleopatra.Here they are together, the dancing ones, with my sister Chris still pleased behind them, in her white sheath of a dress. She looked like the pictures of the willowy youthful Cleopatra, a Macedonian Greek. Her dancing equivalent wore the characteristic serpent headdress and very little else, perfect for the athleticism, passion, and eroticism of her dance.This was a wonderful thing, like opera, with scene-by-scene synopsis provided in the program.Original music by Charles Wetherbee, performed by Carpe Diem String Quartet.You can read the rave review here and a summary account here, with all the credits!"},
{"title": "Ars Dentifrica", "date": "Thursday, January 17, 2013", "text": "Don't worry. That's an entirely made up phrase. I've been reading Doc, a historical novel by Mary Doria Russell, about Doc Holliday, the famous dentist of the Wild West. The novel is mostly set in Dodge City, Kansas, but also visits Georgia, Texas, California, Arizona, and Colorado. Doc Holliday sets up a practice in Dodge, and we get to see him make a marvelous partial denture. Alongside shootouts and poker, of course.But on p. 215 of the book there's a sort of ars dentifrica that could serve as an ars poetica as well, a sort of explanation for why a poet writes, what is the essence of poetry, and what is that particular person's essential task in poetry. Here, the essence of dentistry.  Doc's girlfriend, Kate, is wondering, since he can make way more money dealing cards, \"why in hell you bother with this!\"\"Why?\"She grabs his papers and equipment, frustrated, and asks again.\"'Because,' he said, astonished that he had to say it, 'I can relieve sufferin'.\"She's stunned, still not understanding why he would do something if can make more money doing something else, why he helps people who can't pay him, etc. She can't understand why he has to do the thing he is good at and has a talent for, whether or not people can or will pay him.\"I bother with all this because I can relieve sufferin,'\"he repeats. \"I can improve lives. Sometimes I can even save them.\"I think many a writer, poet, artist is similarly driven. We create in order to relieve suffering. Sometimes we can improve lives, even save someone, depending on the circumstances. The right word falling on the right ears, or heart, at the right time. We don't know. And, in some cases, it's ourselves we are saving. We don't do it for the money, and we can't not do it.Of course, dentistry advanced, and people pay for it. Art continues, and people are less willing to pay for it.But look at this tooth, the Roman Coliseum carved into it! (Many thanks to Maureen E. Doallas for showing me the carved tooth. She shares a lot of poetry and art via Twitter, Facebook, and her blog, Writing Without Paper.)"},

She's a classy babe.I sort of giggle (and sort of don't get) that some people responded to the card shower invitation by saying they wished they could come.

I thought I was appealing to both visual and verbal learners and Facebookish people far more technological than I am! But maybe I somehow didn't make the map visible, though I made the event visible to \"Friends of Guests,\" which I thought would cover it.

Here are a few:Thomasand Beulah by Rita DoveSaint Monica by Mary BiddingerPinion and Figure Studies by Claudia EmersonAnd TheWild Iris, by Louise Glück, poems that speak as flowers, God, times of day.Whoor what inspired you to write this book?I was looking at cornfields in fall,and began to see Cassandra, who, of course, never actually lived in theAmerican Midwest.  So that was weird.  The poems gushed out like blood.Whatelse about your book might pique the reader's interest?It’shilarious.  And scary.  And there are pancakes in it.Links to some of the poems:4Cassandra poems at blossombones,including“Cassandra Reads Beowulf Aloud to Her Imaginary Daughter”“Cassandra Goes Over the Top” at Fickle Muses“Cassandra Stands in Front of the House” at FickleMuses“Cassandra Teaches Everything to Her Brother” at FickleMuses  “Cassandra Observes the Midwestern Landscape in September” at Arsenic Lobster“Cassandra Confuses the Chorus for a Flock of Birds” at Redheaded StepchildOtherCassandra poems appear or are forthcoming in Poems & Plays, Slipstream,and Spillway.

I suppose you could see a tilted, makeshift cross in the duct tape on the window, especially with the ghostly strip of glue on glass extending past the main vertical, but I see a symbolic, makeshift \"Y\" saying, \"Why?\" about so many things.This is a sad, dark, dangerous time of year for those who suffer from depression, who live side by side with the joyful tidings of others. I feel grateful and lucky to be able to come up out of my own darker moods. It's not an act of will for many.But I do feel at times like the road signs are down in our society.How lovely, then, to be able to gather with women friends last night for book group. Pam, the hostess, had asked if I'd read the last chapter aloud, and I did, though I cried where I always cry, in this hilarious book, The Worst Best Christmas Pageant Ever, by Barbara Robinson, when the Herdman kids make an old story new, and real.And the soup was yummy! And I took pumpkin muffins (some sprinkled with chocolate chips) and gluten-free pumpkin bread in a loaf soon to be delivered to my mother, as our gluten-free member is no longer gluten-free! Small joys, small pleasures, small acts of sharing. Never-ending consequences.Please take a look at World Without End at EIL, a variety of poetic responses to the idea of the end of the world. What that means in some personal ways."},

A friend emailed to say he'd heard me on Poetry Radio, so here's that: \"Nocturne,\" a poem from Nocturnes (Hyacinth Girl Press), with music by Nina Zanetti from Beside Still Waters. Then another friend sent me this link to a favorite Chopin piece I used to play on the piano! But this is jazzy and on the clarinet. (It's a prelude, not a nocturne, but who's counting? As I recall, the nocturnes were harder.)Another friend sent pictures of Emily Dickinson stuff, including this letter seal! I love how the name is necessarily backwards. These small, sweet, steady, kind connections keep me going. Thank you, dear ones.Meanwhile, as misinformation and rants still fly about the internet, there are also sweet, calm tributes and reminders, including this opinion piece in the New York Times, \"Don't Blame Autism for Newtown,\" by Priscilla Gilman. I'm glad I read it.And last but not least, these ancient bones, evidence that people and communities have always been willing and able to care for one another. \"Ancient Bones that Tell a Story of Compassion,\" by James Gorman.

Not very far, just for local errands. This morning, downtown to the indoor farmers market at the museum—soybeans,organic flour, zucchini. Supporting local farmers and a cultural institution,mingling with real people. Since Friday afternoon, when I heard the news aboutConnecticut, I’ve felt like a flattire—deflated, dysfunctional, in the midst of being replaced. But connecting withothers and doing small homey things has felt right.I’m sad about my country. We’re sick. We’re polarized. Wedemonize each other. We politicize everything. We live driven by the desire formoney and power. We live driven by fear. I don’t want to live this way, but Iam stuck in a society in decline, like the Roman Empire (as people have beenpointing out for years.) America is a clock that’s winding down.The relentless cheer-fulness and be positive crap gets to me.It’s a kind of denial, causing Americans to be “brightsided,” as BarbaraEhrenreich would say. If you point this out, you’re considered unpatriotic,negative. Whistleblowers get fired, etc. But somebody’s got to say there’ssomething wrong. Real hope isn’t faked and isn’t a cliché. It happens in theface of real sorrow, shame, anger, and despair. Real positivity takes quite abit of real courage, I think. It’s not a simple set of rules to follow, orpretend to follow (while you are out aligning yourself with money and power).Real love is genuine. You feel it.I’m glad for the tight little spare I carry around for thetimes I get deflated. It’s sort of like the Grinch’s heart, I guess, “two sizestoo small.” But it does the job. Tomorrow I’ll sorrow with others; we’ll standin a circle and sing, like Whos in Whoville. Monday, I’ll get a new tire, theright size. Tuesday, maybe my heart will be huge, and I’ll have love to…spare.Yes, to spare, to waste, to fling about like glitter that’ll get stuck oneverything."},

Sue me.Hafiz was a Sufi master. (I might be part Sufi.*) *ecstatic desert momentfrom “The Life and Work of Hafiz” by Henry S. Mindlin (theintroduction to The Gift, poems byHafiz, translated by Daniel Ladinsky): “In the West, Sufism is usually regardedas a form of Islamic mysticism.” Despite my ecstatic desert moment, I am noIslamic mystic.  But wait:“However, the Sufis themselves say their ‘way’ has alwaysexisted, under many names, in many lands, associated with the mysticaldimension of every spiritual system. In ancient Greece, for example, they wereidentified with the wisdom (sophia)schools of Pythagoras and Plato. At the time of Jesus, they were called Essenesor Gnostics. After Muhammad, they adopted many of the principles andformulations of Islam and became known in the Muslim world as ‘Sufis,’ a wordgiven various meanings, including ‘wisdom,’ ‘purity,’ and ‘wool’ (for thecoarse woolen habits of wandering dervishes).”Yes, dervishes!Rumi was a dervish!

Pi, an interfaith guy, has been patient in the face of mockery and ostracism for his ability to study and practice religions that usually don't get along with each other.\"There are always those who take it upon themselves to defend God, as if Ultimate Reality, as if the sustaining frame of existence, were something weak and helpless. These people walk by a widow deformed by leprosy begging for a few paise, walk by children dressed in rags living in the street, and they think, \"Business as usual.\" But if they perceive a slight against God, it is a different story. Their faces go red, their chests heave mightily, they sputter angry words. The degree of their indignation is astonishing. Their resolve is frightening.\"These people fail to realize that it is on the inside that God must be defended, not on the outside. They should direct their anger at themselves. For evil in the open is but evil from within that has been let out. The main battlefield for good is not the open ground of the public arena but the small clearing of each heart. Meanwhile, the lot of widows and homeless children is very hard, and it is to their defence, not God's, that the self-righteous should rush.\"So there.And now I can say goodbye to that pink mini-post-it note.  And now, thanks to Rei at Wikipedia, here is some inner life of blackberry pie with ice cream."},

And sometimes they refer to the bloglater, IRL, showing they were there.(I always hope my own Lurkers mainly love me. Example: Mymom) (Who sometimes comments, here or IRL.)(Mom, IRL = in real life.)Know-it-alls—Theycomment in a way that suggests some flaw or error in what you posted and also suggeststheir greater knowledge, even if they don’t provide evidence of that byactually correcting the error or proving that it was an error in the firstplace, as when they just add additional facts, as if you were really stupid toleave those out, or elaborations that pretty much destroy the subtle joke youprovided in the original post. Well, really, they probably don’t care what youintended, as they are just displaying their own knowledge. Over and over again.(This happens mostly at Facebook, where I mostly look the other way.)Anonymous (plural, Anonymi)—It is possible for “Anonymous” to post here, just likeeveryone else, but I generally hope for some informal signature or little clueas to the identity/safeness of the comment poster. (Example: “—Love, yoursister, Chris” or “—the real Shakespeare”) (I don’t post commercialsby Anonymi.)Snarks:  They rarely comment, but when they do, it’ssnarky.Sharks:  They may read, i.e., lurk, but they areunable to comment, having fins instead of fingers and being always underwater,swimming. (If someday they find a way to post, they must prove they are notrobots.)Robots—Robots arefree to post if they identify themselves as robots and can prove they are notrobots.(Let’s all expect a Know-it-all to tell me what’s wrong withthat.)HumorlessKnow-it-alls—See above.Skimmers—Theymerely skim the blog entry and leave a comment that proves it.(I leave them at the mercy of Know-it-alls who happen tocomment after them.)Pretenders—If anyof the actual Pretenders, say, Chrissie Hynde, wish to comment, they shouldfeel free.  But pretend Pretenders pretendto know me, leaving an Anonymous comment that suggests a familiarity with mewithout proving that we really know each other, in person or online. So I don’tpublish their comments/commercials.  Sameas with:Stalkers—I save their unpublished comments, whichthey may think are untraceable, but which aren’t (that’s a double negative, youHumorless Know-it-all, that makes sense in this context) if you know technologyand law-enforcement people (and I do), in case of legal action later. (If I end up dead someday, my mom knows what to do.)Zombies—I thinkmy origami brain is safe from zombies, here in the blog, anyway.(My mom won’t know how to handle zombies.)TMI-ers—OK, I amprobably one of these, and I don’t mind them at all when they post here (unlessthey write seven paragraphs about their childhood and psychological diagnoses,which I have seen/skimmed at other blogs), as long as it is fairly short and mostlygood-natured.  (If you have more to say,hey, you can start your own blog!) I know I often make a personal connectionwhen I comment at other blogs, noting coincidences, etc.  (Example: “I baked pumpkin bread today, too!”or “I have also written a poem with that title” or “Is that a fin, or are youjust happy to see me?”)So, generally, it is not too much information!

I have a copy given to me by Gary, who writes in books, so it was fun to read it noticing his underlining and the occasional marginal note, like, \"Hallucination?\"My husband read it before me, and he stuck a post-it (hot pink) on the back jacket flap: \"Chapter 56. Fear.\" Chapter 56 is indeed about fear. My husband's handwriting looks remarkably like Gary's handwriting, but Tony claims he doesn't write in books, so 1) maybe I am really married to Gary and am just hallucinating that I am married to Tony 2) Tony forgot that he wrote in this book 3) the handwriting similarity is a mere coincidence.But why didn't he warn me about Part 3? I finished Part 2, and said, \"I think the part where you've written 'Hallucination' is real.\" He 1) said he doesn't write in books 2) thought I was talking about the algae island. I was talking about the voice with a French accent. (So maybe I'm not married to Gary.) He (Tony, not Gary) also mentioned quantum physics, but I did not find any in Life of Pi.Anyway, then I read Part 3, finishing the book weeping. You'll recall that I finished the book The Worst  Best Christmas Pageant Ever, by Barbara Robinson, weeping, too. I have been asked to read the last chapter of The Best Christmas Pageant Ever aloud when our book group meets, so I practiced tonight, right after finishing Life of Pi, and wept all the way through. I will be a laughingstock. Or a cryingstalk.While tear-laden sensitivity does run in my family, neither book is sentimental. The children's book nicely cuts through the crap of Christmas pageants, and Life of Pi was a fascinating adventure novel with zoology and comparative religion in it till I got to Part 3, when it bumped itself up a notch.Both books contain a fine, dark hilarity.

The butter recipe is better.But butter was also on my mind because of WGLT's Poetry Radio, which paired two of my very short poems from Nocturnes--\"In the style of a Japanese courtesan\" and \"Almost Winter\"--with the song \"Butter\" from The Hidden Treasures of Taj Mahal, a bluesy album.These poems aired on Thanksgiving, a buttery day, just my kind of Random Coinciday, but you can also hear them as a podcast if you like.Little did I remember that there is a movie called Butter, about butter carving, but now I feel I must see it someday. It has Jennifer Garner in it and Alicia Silverstone. And butter!And Hugh Jackman.Hugh Jackman.And little did I know, not having been there at all, let alone in the right light, that the actual Taj Mahal is known for turning yellow.It could be carved from butter.Thanks to Wikipedia for the stick of butter (by Steve Karg) and the Taj Mahal! Thanks to Bruce Bergethon at WGLT for taping and airing the poems. Thanks to IMDb for the movie poster. Thanks to Taj Mahal for the smooth music. And thanks to Hugh Jackman."},

They are longish poems, pursuing their topics thoroughly, withrichness and subtlety, each one often containing the seed of its opposite. ButI must return to those women in “Positions of Strength,” noting the wonderfulcalm title:A couple of women talk to the fire, ask why it dies, ask whymenembrace them, erase them, use them to get born or get a leg upto heaven,leaving them behind, Bodhisattvas at the gate,and in the rain and cold of interiors that no man knows.            There areno sexual mutilations here, no bride burnings.Just two women talking.Just one woman, really, with nothing leftbut that she can still blush, fall in love, extend herselfto anythingas if it were as sentient and complex as she.            Nothingleft but that when the columbine opens wideand the trees seem female, she can cry for them.For the delicate evergreens, and for the chestnut tree as itpulls itself to leaf again.For any man, for each hour, for every brick and creature,and for the dust that will be back every other dayon the street paved with oyster shells, in the faded yellow housewhere a woman’s glad to sayhow much she had that she could give away.Thanks to JJ Harrison and Peter Ruhr and Wikipedia for the columbine.

{"title": "\"It\"", "date": "Tuesday, October 16, 2012", "text": "This is not about Stephen King's novel, It, nor the scary 2-part movie/mini-series based on it. (Heh, \"it.\" Get it?!) This is not even about It, the 1927 film starring Clara Bow, the original \"It girl,\" though understanding the  importance of the word \"it\" in that helps to understand the \"it\" in this (and helps establish the free use rationale for this poster of that film!) (\"It\" as opposed to \"that,\" as in That Girl, for instance, an ABC sitcom about another \"It girl,\" played by Marlo Thomas.) (Wait. What?!)Anyhoo, yesterday I posted a link to the new issue of Eclectica and my poem \"Blackberry Moon\" in it. Over on Facebook, a friend asked if the \"it\" in a line of the poem referred to the moon or the garden hose. And that is the subject of today's blog!*As you can see if you scroll down this Poetry Contents page, the sentence containing the line is highlighted as an excerpt from that poem. In the excerpt, the \"it\" seems, grammatically, and from the only evidence provided there, to refer to the moon itself, the blackberry moon, black as a snake:When I went to look for the blackberrymoon, it lay uncoiled there, a hardslick snake.But in the poem itself, these lines are preceded by others that provide more evidence and another interpretation of the \"it.\"I'd dragged the garden hose here and thereall the unknown day.So, in the narrative logic of the poem, the \"it\" could refer to the uncoiled garden hose, left in the yard \"all the unknown day,\" as the speaker didn't know rain would creep in overnight (which is how the poem begins, if we continue to go backwards, as I often do--born that way). The more precise and correct grammar of the sentence is suspended (like the word \"blackberry,\" hanging off the end of a line and over the \"moon\" it modifies and over a stanza break...though not in the centered excerpt on the Poetry contents page, which loses the gap and compresses the grammar to the precisely correct kind...for a moment. This is why form is inextricable from content in poetry, and why poetry drives some people a little crazy! If they weren't already born that way.) Two things can happen simultaneously in the poem then: the \"it\" can be the moon or the hose.  And then, oddly enough, the moon, as well as the hose, can be a snake.My close-reading friend asked, next, whether this would be the new moon or a sliver, and also about the size of snakes that could lie curled in a basket, which sent me on a Cleopatra journey in my mind (to become a geographical journey in November, though not to Egypt--to Ohio, instead--wait. What?) and the answer, from evidence in the poem, might support the new moon, as the only light comes from the interior of the house, or another phase, with clouds covering the moon (the rain of the opening line). Also, the sky is a really big basket. Also, the line \"What light there was from the inside shining out\" seems also to have emotional and/or spiritual content in the poem, as well as a concrete effect on the new trash can. (See poem.) (The new trash cans are huge, but not as big as the basket of sky.)But back to \"it.\" I don't want to trick or mislead the reader, so it was a risk to use \"it\" in this way. I do want to help the reader to pay very close attention to the words and other choices on the page, as this attentiveness is I think crucial not just to appreciating and interpreting poetry, but to appreciating and responding to life itself. (And why else would I write?)I think a close reader of poetry can hold the garden hose in his/her mind and the hidden moon in her/his mind long enough to see and imagine both a \"snake\" in the grass and a coiled and uncoiled moon in the sky, and to wonder whether some things are \"meant to be kept hidden\" or not, and why, and not just trash cans, and so on. I think if we look at and listen to the world attentively enough, it comes alive with possibility and full of wonder, whether the moon is visible or not. And when this happens, even the ordinary acts of watering a garden, taking out the garbage, and wishing on a star are extraordinary and full of beauty and joy. But, hey, that's just me. Wait. What?! Oh, surely it's you, too.And, by the way, some snakes are egg eaters. Take a look at the blackberry moon on this giant egg, part of the fabulous Faberge Big Egg Hunt in London!*Darn it! (Heh, \"it.\" Get it?!) I should have called this \"The Moon or the Garden Hose.\" But then we wouldn't have Clara Bow or Marlo Thomas to look at, although Cleopatra probably would have gotten herself in here, thanks to Shakespeare's asp. (Heh. Shakespeare saved her asp.) Cleopatra was definitely the \"It girl\" of her time--the one with phenomenal magnetism! What is \"it\"? It's hard to define, but it absolutely attracts.If you are still here, thank you. It means you are coiled in my origami brain. Heaven help us."},

I have two moon poems in it, \"Cusp\" and \"Blackberry Moon,\" the latter coming from the American Indian (Choctaw) name for the October full moon, according to this interesting list of moon names.That list also gives the English Medieval and Neo Pagan name of Blood Moon to the full October moon, which gave rise to my poem \"Blue Blood Moon\" in Stirring last year around this time! The blue moon is the second full moon in a month, so the blue blood moon is when that happens in October...if you are medieval or a neo pagan.

Really, he is funny, and I understand all ofphilosophy much better than I did before, and I am only on page 175.You can find him and it here. I am reading the navy blue hardback withyellow lettering, but I love the swimming elephant on the paperback cover.The elephant comes from Haidt’s metaphor for what we are, eachof us with “a divided self” : a rational rider on a huge elephant, withinstincts and desires of its own. Willpower, rational control, and rightthinking are all great, but the elephant is really big, strong, and goes whereit wants to go.Haidt connects this to how the brain really works, using“controlled processes” and “automatic processes,” and so much of what we do isautomatic, involuntary, and habitual. “In sum, the rider is an advisor orservant; not a king, president, or charioteer with a firm grip on the reins.The rider is…conscious, controlled thought. The elephant, in contrast, iseverything else. The elephant includes the gut feelings, visceral reactions,emotions, and intuitions that comprise much of the automatic system. Theelephant and the rider each have their own intelligence, and when they worktogether well they enable the unique brilliance of human beings. But they don’talways work together well.” Ain’t that the truth!?Anyhoo, I am delighted and comforted by this book, becauseit honors the elephant! The elephant 1) does really good things for us and 2)can be trained. Too often, people who advise me think the human is simply therider! They ignore the elephant. Or think the elephant is the servant. The rider is the “advisor or servant” or, inmy view, both, along with loving, respectful animal trainer/circus rider. Thewhole human being is the reasoning being AND the powerful animal, and we needto recognize and respect gut feelings and intuition, hungers and passions,etc., and not pretend 1) they are not there 2) they are easy to “tame” orcontrol 3) they are not part of the real human being.There was more I wanted to say about the elephant and thebook, but, if I go on (and on) it will no longer be 10-11-12. So I’ll stop now,resume later, and you can leave elephantine comments.Thanks to Wikipedia and Peter H. Wrege for the whole elephant and the African forest elephant!"},

Thanks, also, to advice from Advance Computing, a local computer repair shop. We will give you our business on affordable repairs, and I love the glittery blue pencil with your name and number on it!!But this Red Sea Fan, Coral, Shells is another fine painting by Jonathan Koch.*and the one I chose during a wonderful mystical Sufi moment in the desert of Tucson, Arizona...hard to explain...!Hello again. So, I think things are back to normal here. New monitor is a couple inches wider than the old one (which should be good for watching Glee on hulu). At first I put the little stand on backwards (spatial challenge, as well as technology challenge!...but I am good on the Sufi mysticism stuff), and, after a week and a half of no action on my computer it was super slow, as if it had to wake up, clean itself up, and remind itself how to work, but, here we go now!While I was gone, I got poems rejected and accepted, did a jillion outdoor performances in a variety of weather conditions, and watched a bunch of old movies to warm up and wind down from that, while drinking wine.

{"title": "Praying Mantis", "date": "Thursday, September 27, 2012", "text": "The other evening, I took my husband out in the back yard, to the balsam growing three feet high by the fence, to see both the praying mantis and the hummingbird moth. The mantis, with natural camouflage that makes it look like leaves and stems, also has an abdomen that resembles the seedpods of balsam, also known as touch-me-not because these seedpods explode at a light touch!The praying mantis was out eating baby crickets, no doubt. The hummingbird moth was exploring the nectar of the pink and pale pink blossoms. We were in twilight, and darkness settled around us, inside the awe, an expansive, opening state of mind. Then, because there were things to be done, we went inside and did them.I've been reading After the Ecstasy, the Laundry, by Jack Kornfield, subtitled How the Heart Grows Wise on the Spiritual Path. I'm glad to be on a spiritual path, however meandering, and glad to know I'm not alone in 1) wishing the ecstasy could last and 2) needing to do the relentless laundry.Balsam is a variety of impatiens (aka impatience), and I cannot be impatient with myself, waiting for my heart to grow wise. Sigh...The hummingbird moth, or Hemaris, a kind of sphinx moth, has that nickname because it is, and looks like, a moth, when its wings are still, and, with its wings beating, looks like a hummingbird. In Britain and Europe, a similar moth is called the Hummingbird Hawk-moth, or Hummingmoth (love that!). I'm going to ponder the twilight confusion of the hummingbird moth and the ecstasy of warm, fresh laundry, and how good it feels to fold the clothes and deposit them in the rooms of the ones who wear them.Here are the furiously beating wings of the humming-moth, in a photo by IronChris. Reminds me of myself, spinning my wheels in search of sweetness. Getting nowhere, but ecstatic, aloft, and up close to beauty.

I've slowed down in the blog, result of a busy summer preparing for a busy fall: some upcoming performances (of a historical nature), a trip to Ohio to help prepare a dance/theatre performance, etc. But as my life and mind scatter, I am also all the more open to synchronicity--some marvelous nonlinear random coincidii too hard to explain--and my heart fills with awe.So what I'll remark on today is the coincidence that the summer issue of Poemeleon, its Epistolary issue, has come out on the Autumnal Equinox, as mentioned by editor Cati Porter in her letter to her readers on the Table of Contents page. This page will link you to all sorts of wonders, and I have much to read (and have barely got going on the new issue of storySouth! Ah, the busy fall reading starts with a bang!)I have two poems in the issue, one that resulted from writing some Amnesty International letters with blogger and real life friend, Kim, and from haphazardly planting a cantaloupe in my back yard (it blossomed and twined! but bore no fruit), and one inspired by mutual disappointment and fireworks (and Jiminy Cricket!).I love the coincidence that my statement above the poems mentions the annual cemetery walk, about to begin at Evergreen Cemetery in Bloomington, Illinois (check Events, at right), and if this issue had come out in the summer, as planned, rather than the fall equinox, as happened, the connection would not have been so pertinent as it is now. Synchronicity.Isn't it cool that a \"poemeleon\" is a poem + a chameleon and can resemble anything it needs to resemble, as a poem can resemble a letter, and vice versa. Oh, Emily Dickinson!: \"This is my letter to the world...\"Thanks to Wikipedia for the shareable chameleons--the green one (coincidentally female), by Chiswick Chap, and the Madagascar chameleon, above, by Bernard Gagnon.

Very loud, very sci fi, very wonderful. (More, perhaps, on Total Recall and Philip K. Dick later.)We had extra cookies, so we had our choice of fortunes. My second fortune was this: \"Your power is in your ability to decide.\" First I had to decide what the heck this meant. Was it about the nature of my power? How much I have? Whether and how to exercise it?  As in, Your future is in your own hands. OR did it mean, as I just realized today, \"Your power [resides in] your ability to decide,\" or, again in other words, \"Your ability to make decisions determines how powerful you are.\" Ack! I am a crappy decision maker. This is not only a weakness of mine, but, because of past crappy decisions, an ongoing source of mild anxiety. No wonder I blocked this particular interpretation. Sigh...Fortunately, since I had not ordered the shrimp (a crappy decision), and since my own boy had returned to Chicago and work, A Boy and His Lobster arrived in my mailbox today--that is, the Arsenic Lobster anthology 2012, including my poem, \"Cassandra Observes the Midwestern Landscape in September\" from the Spring 2012 issue online.

So change, I guess, disrupts that, briefly, until it resettles into whatever is (now).Some people who know me might not realize I'm that way, just as I didn't realize it, because I am also stable, reliable, responsible, and always ticking things off a to-do list and looking ahead on the calendar to plan, to be available, to get the job done, etc.I imagine many of us are aware of balancing the now with the oncoming future, the linear of our lives with the swirling nonlinear of it. But I think there are degrees of awareness, and mine must be acute (now) in this area. (And I'm aware that I'm unaware in other areas!)This musing reminds me of a wonderful blog post on \"growing up backwards\" by Natalie the Singing Fool in her blog, The Cat Lady Sings.

I do love to write poems in response to paintings. Perhaps there is a pink-capped hot-chocolate poem in my future!Lastly, a big fluffy black cat named Boo Radley is living with us this week. He appears to be hiding at the moment, perhaps because of the thunder, but he's very comfortable here, lounging with us, luxuriating under the petting, and purring up a storm. Every morning at 4:10, he checks to see if I wanted to get up or anything, and again at 6:10, and, after some petting and purring, I do.Ooh, reading on the couch.** Another good option on a rainy day! **Possibly with a cat."},

Mine always has a few dishes in the sink, or next to it, a few crumbs on the surfaces, and many, many non-kitchen-related items on all surfaces: car keys, volleyball schedules, volleyball bags, sometimes even volleyball shoes. Today's mail, yesterday's coupons, a drawing of somebody else's kitchen rehab or hip roof, a book or literary journal with a bookmark in it, and various random items. Often, I put these random items on the stairs to go up. And there they remain.It's Julia Child's 100th birthday. This may inspire me to make tomato sauce from garden tomatoes for supper tonight. They were left for me on the picnic table in the back yard by my mother, along with a bag of fresh-picked green beans. Thanks, Mom! I was off at work, conveniently time around my daughter's morning volleyball practice. (Freelancing is good!)Now she's off at practice, round 2, which today is community service as a team, for team bonding. She = daughter, not mother. (Community service is good!)I was celebrating Julia Child at Escape Into Life today, too, by telling you \"what's cooking\" for 3 of the EIL solo feature poets. If you are a poet with something good cooking, please tell our readers over there!And here is a delicious new painting by Jonathan Koch, Peach, Black-berries, Walnut. That could make a mouthwatering crumble, couldn't it? With lots and lots of butter."},
{"title": "Following Up", "date": "Sunday, August 12, 2012", "text": "Synchronicity again, and following up. The service for Michael Pullin was just lovely. I choked up immediately, when the minister choked up, telling about the sign on the door of The Garlic Press that said they were closed to celebrate the life of their friend. And there was the staff, in a row (and scattered about the church). Here are some of the cooking classes he taught--alas, with his name still on them, to add a pinch of nostalgia.And here is a wonderful and thorough profile of Michael Pullin, at Julie Kistler's blog, A Follow Spot.Michael received great applause and a standing ovation at the end of this service, just the right touch.Today, over at my own church, the reflection was on \"the fragility of existence\" in terms of its very unlikeliness. \"How are we even here?\" we might ask ourselves, as a way to more fully appreciate that we are, and, as Bob Ryder reminds us, not to take life for granted, nor \"to get too used to it.\"And my post on the \"well-earned bravada\" in the robot voice of Curiosity on Mars led poet Ron Hardy to comment that his poem \"Hearing Her Voice\" was about the inability to hear the voice of the planet herself, that Mother onto which our Curiosity descends. You can read the poem here.I am struck each time by this:The moment we see the other will bethe moment of helpless compression.Ron's poem made me think of \"Mars is Heaven,\" a Ray Bradbury story, and a scary one, with irony as well as nostalgia. And I was just reading a profile of the moral philosopher Derek Parfit, who questions the whole concept of personal identity, reinforcing the fragility of existence. And I saw the end of a documentary on quantum physics that makes me want to see the beginning of it. Which I will. But, hey, end, beginning? It might all be now."},
{"title": "Behind the Bravada", "date": "Saturday, August 11, 2012", "text": "I was behind an Oldsmobile Bravada yesterday, right after hearing the term \"bravada\" on NPR. I love when that happens. It's as if the universe has decided to neatly collate itself in my mind. OR as if I am folding blueberries into pancake batter. Completely different images, both from my origami brain.Anyway, the bravada on NPR was about the voice of the Mars rover Curiosity, in a story about the tweets from Mars on Morning Edition. Curiosity's tweets were given a male voice and a female voice, and scientist Stephanie Smith said Curiosity spoke with \"well-earned bravada.\" This sent me scurrying toward the word \"bravada,\" which we often hear changed into \"bravado,\" often used to mean a show of bravery, or swagger, even if no real courage exists, or there's not much foundation for the apparent confidence. But the real and root meaning, from a Spanish term, does go back or \"wild\" and \"brave,\" so \"well-earned bravada\" can refer to a swagger based on true boldness, backed by action!This, by the way, was swagger as expressed in tone of voice and choice of phrasing. (And it's hard to convey tone at all electronically, so mainly choice of phrasing.) You can hear it all at the link to \"Followers Embrace Curiosity's Mars Tweets.\"Then my brain folded back to that phrase \"fake it till you make it,\" which can mean swagger until you succeed, which is something I cannot do myself. Odd, since I worked as an actor, I suppose, but I can't really fake it. I have to mean it. \"It,\" whatever it is, has to come from somewhere real and deep in me, so I have to summon real courage and real competence to succeed at anything.Curiosity can be my robot role model, then, thanks to her \"well-earned bravada.\"I am unlikely ever to own or drive an Oldsmobile Bravada.Anyhoo, I admire and forgive those who can \"fake it till they make it,\" even when it comes off as a bit arrogant. We are all on a difficult journey, I imagine. Look at this nice quotation (thanks to poet Kelli Russell Agodon) from David Rakoff--another NPR connection, This American Life--from his book Half Empty:\"People are really trying their best. Just like being happy and sad, you will find yourself on both sides of the equation many times over your lifetime, either saying or hearing the wrong thing. Let's all give each other a pass, shall we?\""},

His obituary says he was 65. I think our last deep, extended conversation was about such things--he was philosophical about life and death, very calm and at peace--and I recalled him saying that when his obituary was published, no one would know who he was because we know him as Michael Pullin and the paper would print Thomas Pullin, as it did. But we all know who he is.What a funny, energetic, talented man he was. He was my husband in the play Dinner With Friends, at Heartland Theatre, and my fantasy lover in the play, A History of Things that Never Happened. We cracked ourselves up in the latter, re-enacting scenes from Wuthering Heights and Anna Karenina.And, of course, there's the butcher block moment in Dinner With Friends. What a good sport. And an actual gourmet cook, very pertinent to this play, who taught cooking classes in town! I am only one of the many, many people who will miss him.How do the living handle these losses? So many ways. There will be a celebration of Michael Pullin's life on Saturday, and I'm sure it will have plenty of laughter with the tears, as he would want to be remembered with joy and a sense of fun.For those who ponder death and grief with the aid of poetry, here are two unsentimental poems that handle these dark topics well:\"How I Will Outwit Grief,\" by Donna Vorreyer, in The Bakery (Fresh Out of the Oven)and\"When He's Dead,\" by Mike Puican, in The Cortland Review.Now I offer you some Strawberries and Cream (hold the cream).

{"title": "Midlife Scrimshaw", "date": "Wednesday, August 8, 2012", "text": "Well, dear readers, I've been \"gone\" again and will compress myself here, doing multiple days of the week in one (see labels at bottom of blog entry).Today I celebrate the new poetry feature over at Escape Into Life: Carol Berg. Her \"Wife's Mid-life Crisis\" poems are accompanied by albatross photographs by Stefano Unterthiner (which you can see a glimpse of here, too). The albatross was an omen of good luck for mariners, until one of them killed one (in a poem) and then the phrase \"an albatross around my neck\" came to mean a great burden or curse. So keep that in mind.Speaking of mariners, my book group just discussed The Art of Fielding, which has a character named Henry Scrimshander in it, and a running Moby Dick/Herman Melville component, and now, in a perfect random coinciday moment, we are reading Cloud Atlas, by David Mitchell, in which a character in the first section possesses \"a handsome army of scrimshandered chessmen.\"A scrimshander is someone who makes tools or art from the bone, teeth, and tusks of whales, walruses, and other marine animals, this all being called scrimshaw. I'm interested in Mitchell's choice of language here; he didn't say \"scrimshaw chessmen\" but instead \"scrimshandered,\" emphasizing the maker and the making. So I'll keep that in mind.My own making and work and daily action have been inter-rupted lately, by good things--a vacation, a weekend with old friends, a visit with our son to see his new apartment--and by not good things, which continue to preoccupy me. I've been thinking of the phrase \"heart goes out,\" as my heart goes out to someone who is suffering and, perhaps while it is busy glowing there, my heart goes out like a light and is dark for a while at home. I need one of those long-lasting environmentally aware heart lights.Oh, I have one!! (light bulb hovers over head)"},

I learn & feel so much.

Tomorrow may or may not be an actual Thor's Day.Today I am showing you some beautiful women cheerfully guarding the dessert table at the 2nd (annual) memorial celebration of the life of Chris Al-Aswad, founder of Escape Into Life. You can read more about it in the EIL Blog today (and see more pix) and more about Chris, including a journal poem about his connection to his mother, here.I'll pause to mention that my church used to have a fundraiser called Just Desserts that was indeed just desserts but that the phrase \"just deserts\" is about justly receiving what you deserve, a common misspelling and misconception. But a sweet one!In life, I don't know if we all receive our just deserts. Or we do and don't always know it. Oh, karma!I just paused to Google the question, \"Is there a dessert called karma?\" and found this: Sweet Karma Desserts. Thank you. And you're welcome!What was I saying? Oh, yes, I also enjoy this photo of the men discussing the problems of the world and my husband guzzling beer in the background.I think there was more I wanted to tell you, and more that ties in with just deserts/desserts, making it also a Random Coinciday in the blog. Yes. Tonight I will be discussing The Art of Fielding, by Chad Harbach, and eating angel food cake baked by our hostess, with the book group, inviting partners to partake this evening (whether or not they read the book, but it's a baseball-philosophical novel, chosen with partners in mind). I will be taking cherries, because life is a bowl of them.In The Art of Fielding, a promising young baseball star encounters unexpected personal failure and self-doubt. It's perfect to be looking closely at this book during the Olympics, with all those stories of high expectations, upsets, glory, and confidence lost and found. And, of course, driving home from lap swimming this morning, I got to hear Frank Deford talking about \"Four Sports Superstars, Four Years Later\" on NPR, which ties right in."},

{"title": "Hometown Blues", "date": "Sunday, July 15, 2012", "text": "Yesterday I was praising my hometown and its new transportation center, and today in church Jesus was having the hometown blues. “People who tell the truth are honored, except when they’re in their hometown,\" he said, according to the pastor and the Scarlet Letter Bible.The Scarlet translation continues, saying he was \"exasperated\" with his hometown residents, \"couldn't do anything significant with them,\" and sent his apostles off in pairs to do good works for those who were open to them. “'Whenever you go somewhere,' he told them, 'stay in one house until you leave. If you and your message are unwelcome somewhere, just shake it off.'”I love that advice: \"just shake it off.\" If only it were that easy. But, as Pastor Susan reminded us, the contemporary \"shake it off\" advice captures the image of \"shaking the dust off your feet\" when you are out healing the sick in your sandals.Yep, Jesus sent them off with \"[No] food, no bags, no money in their pockets. He had them wear sandals, and let them take only one shirt.\" This reminded me of how I travel, and the reflection was titled \"Traveling Light\" and was about the burden of possessions in addition to the hometown blues.I do travel light. I take my purse--which, it's true, has a brush and comb in it, a toothbrush, and a tube of toothpaste (yes, a whole tube...until it's less than a whole tube...which takes a while)--and a cloth bag that usually has my rolled-up jammies and a change of underwear and socks and, yes, one (extra) shirt.And, a natural Blanche DuBois, I often depend on the kindness of strangers. Or old friends.(I'm sure, by the way, that you can find a picture online of Stanley Kowalski in a ripped t-shirt.) Anyhoo...I reflected on a lot of stuff today: how we can be appreciated by strangers and unappreciated in our hometowns, how we can shake it off, and how we can travel light. And now I wish you well on your own journey.

I admired the collaboration and dedication and excellent planning it took to build Uptown Station and renovate our little town.There we all stood--important people (well, they were sitting), townspeople, the media, and union laborers in orange shirts--listening to the congratulatory, grateful, and inspiring speeches of our town mayor, Amtrak's board chairman, U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood and Senator Dick Durbin. It was joyful, respectful, and bipartisan! You can read about it or watch a video here, via local radio station WJBC.There was a rumor that President Obama might be there--he was invited to this event back in April--but he wasn't, unless they were hiding him inside the station, to go on the first tour of the station's interior with the other important people.

{"title": "Blackberries and Forgiveness", "date": "Sunday, July 8, 2012", "text": "Here is a Study of Blackberries, by the wonderful Jonathan Koch. Today, the heat broke--came down from 105 to 85--and while it did not rain here, there was distant thunder, and the sky was dark in the south, so it probably rained somewhere. I bought a birdbath at the arts fair for the poor, hot birds, watered things in the shade, and I think we'll all be fine.Church made me happy, full of peace, thanks to the topic of \"The Sacred Self,\" or realizing one's \"sacred potential.\" Oddly enough, this tied in with a novel I just read, The Art of Fielding, and three time-loop films my husband and I watched over the last three days, exploring the paradox of freewill and destiny. In all of these works of art, people do or don't realize their [sacred] potential, and I can study them to try to figure out how, or why, or why not.I was a bit surprised to encounter the phrase \"television shows\" in Matthew 6:1-6, but I suppose this is one of those modern translations. Anyhoo, I still got the message that when I do good or give to charity, I should not do it publicly or to get admiration; instead, \"don't let your left hand know what your right hand is doing.\" Ah, I seldom know what my other hand is doing, so I'm OK, I think! Likewise, re: translation, I still hear \"pray in your closet\" when Matthew advises me to \"go into your room and shut the door, and pray to the sacred one who resides in mystery...\" and I see that, at this very moment, the closet door is ajar, so what the heck does that mean? Ah, I should not have announced the birdbath--a charitable act toward the birds!?--but it made me so darn happy. It's beautiful, and I bought something from an artist, which is the way I practice what I preach.Oh, forgive me. Also, the new issue of Hobble Creek Review is up here. I have not had a chance to peruse it yet, but I will! I am glad to be in it, and glad of the fine company. Here is my poem, \"Forgiveness in Lafayette.\""},

To see Sarah's Garden at the David Davis Mansion, a local historic site, with information provided by local master gardeners. When I got there, though, a perfectly reasonable handwritten sign said that no master gardeners would be on hand, due to the excessive heat.I was free to wander the grounds alone, the sign indicated, and the gate was open. But a master gardener appeared! Thank you, Kay! And we looked at what was blooming, stood in the shade that existed, and then sat in the shade of some trees to look at a book of photos of the gardens, laid out as Sarah Davis (a contemporary of Abraham Lincoln) had arranged them, and containing original and heirloom plants: many perennials, some annuals. The gardeners who maintain Sarah's Garden harvest seeds or take cuttings--say, of scarlet geraniums--just like little old me. Or Emily Dickinson!In Sarah's Garden, as in mine, the balsam* is compromised this year, due to the excessive heat and lack of rain. It has begun to bloom but is shorter and sparser than last year. I am hoping it will recover by next year.Meanwhile, the crops are also suffering, and so are the people--for instance, those at the Sugar Creek Arts Festival, which I will put off visiting until tomorrow, on the strength of a hint that it might be a weensy bit cooler tomorrow.At the moment it is 101, but it feels like 110 in the shade (also a musical, based on the play, The Rainmaker). And I was surprised to learn--from Wikipedia, of course--that \"Danger, Will Robinson\" was actually uttered only once during the television series Lost in Space, because I have uttered it numerous times since, and so have many others, including celebrities and characters in films.*aka touch-me-not (as the seedpods will explode!)(\"Danger, Will Robinson!

{"title": "Thistles", "date": "Thursday, July 5, 2012", "text": "Last night, as we sat in the dusky glow before the sun sets, watching the first fireflies, instead of fireworks, appear, I mentioned that, due to the recent visit by goldfinches to the catmint, I was thinking of letting thistle go ahead and bloom instead of digging it up as usual, as goldfinches love thistle seed, too.\"It's illegal to grow thistle in Illinois,\" said my dad. \"Thistle is strong enough to break a combine.\"So, early this morning, still in my swimsuit from lap swimming, as I let the hose soak the flowerbeds in the shade, I dug up the thistles about to bloom, and the little ones along my side of the fence, the ones I could budge with a pitchfork and uproot.Then it occurred to me to doublecheck the law. Indeed, a certain kind of thistle, Canada thistle, is illegal in Illinois. So is purple loosestrife, a beautiful but invasive plant that made its way into one of my poems, along with the legal wildflower yellow loosestrife. (Pretty much any and everything makes its way into my poems. And, hey, thistles made their way into the work of Robert Burns and Edna St. Vincent Millay, too!)The thistles in my own back yard were about to bloom yellow, not lavender, as pictured here, in the beautiful photo by Richard Bartz. So, alas, I may have removed a perfectly innocuous, legal thistle, but they are prickly and could easily do harm to my husband's ankles, if not the lawnmower. Anyhoo, they are gone, and in the bin awaiting compost/yard waste pickup by our lovely town, which now also picks up recycling at the curb. Wooee!And here is the globe thistle, also called Russian thistle in this area, that grows in the ditches beside the cornfields. Russian thistle made its way into one of my first short stories. I used to ride my bike out to the Russian thistles gone to seed, spray them with hairspray to fix them, and bring them home for use in dried flower arrangements--for home use or the county 4-H fair. Mabel, married to the farmer next door, told me how to do this. Mabel is buried up the road in Hudson, Illinois, and I will never forget her--her warmth, her jet black hair.Who knew today would bring Mabel back to me so dearly?"},

Starting with how we treat each other as American citizens and residents of this wonderful country.So I'm going to keep thinking about all that while I gather with family in some \"traditional\" American ways--cookout, game playing, maybe a flea market, maybe not, because it's so hot, and maybe no fireworks, also because of the heat. The fires in the West make me not want to participate in \"recreational fires,\" as our town put it, that might lead to dangerous situations. The cookout will be monitored and self-contained, and no doubt the town fireworks, if they have them, will be extra-supervised, but still....Meanwhile, a new poetry feature is up today at Escape Into Life! It has the work of Bethany Reid, of the American Northwest, a hotbed of poetry, along with rich, provocative collage art by Dave Barnes, starting with a Wild West theme and ending with what I like to call the \"Once upon a time bear.\"Bethany's first poem, \"America, America,\" helps us look back at 9/11, contemplate issues of gun control, and consider the state of American education, all at once! She encourages us to look at things in a context, and to have compassion for one another, even if we don't absolutely agree. Sigh...  I wish we did more of that.Many thanks to EIL, Reid, and Barnes for this meditative morning. I close with another image by Dave Barnes that I fondly call the \"I miss you wolf.\" Faced with my technology challenge, I was not able to crop it successfully enough to use in the EIL feature (see how it has a little of the jump-roping girl's understory?), so I offer my imperfection and his marvelous image here."},

{"title": "Natural Buoyancy", "date": "Wednesday, June 27, 2012", "text": "Today the pool felt great. I felt so naturally buoyant! \"Buoy,\" \"buoyant,\" and \"buoyancy\" are words that always look weird to me, and I pretty much always have to look them up to make sure I put the \"u\" and the \"y\" in the right place.Today I needed to type it to tell you about the new poetry feature, by Peg Duthie, up at Escape Into Life, with collage paintings by Karin Miller. This one is called Natural Buoyancy, but I see that whoever labelled it at EIL (when you hover over the image there) left out the \"u,\" though natural \"boyancy\" sounds pretty fun, too.It's so much fun to pair poems and art at EIL. When I saw the Guess Who? painting, I knew that was a perfect fit with the secret-admirer valentine poem, and everything felt, well, naturally buoyant from then on!And I had fallen in love with Let's Do Lunch when I first saw this Artist Watch feature in mid-June. Generally, I go back a little further, to make sure readers/viewers see some of the previous artists featured at EIL, but this was too perfect a pairing to pass up.But back to buoyancy! As Archimedes said, in 212 B.C., so he could not have been discussing my early-morning lap swimming, \"Any object, wholly or partly immersed in a fluid, is buoyed up by a force equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object.\" I am the partly immersed object!(See gray ball in Wikimedia Commons diagram.)Also, I have been remembering that lover's note, in a famous movie, a romantic comedy, I think, that reads, \"You are my density.\" What is that movie, please?(That guy was naturally boyant.)"},
{"title": "The Empty Protest", "date": "Tuesday, June 26, 2012", "text": "Oh, how I love The Sun. I've been reading the July issue, excerpted past interviews with the late James Hillman, so much to think about.Today I am thinking about his concept of the \"empty protest\" and find much comfort here. Some context: the interview starts with some criticism of the self-absorption of modern psychology, its tendency to focus on a \"fixing\" of the self, not the self's engagement with the world. He's trying to say feelings are important, but so is social justice; so is political action. How can the individual validate his or her feelings and act in the world, and maybe by acting in the world?Near the end of this interview, Hillman says:It's better to go into the world half-cocked than not to go into the world at all. I know when something's wrong. And I can say, \"This is outrageous. This is insulting. This is a violation. And it's wrong.\" I don't know what we should do about it; my protest is absolutely empty. But I believe in that empty protest.Now the \"half-cocked\" might be a little disturbing as an image, related as it is to firearms in our overly-violent, and often half-cocked, as in \"inadequately or poorly prepared\" definition, in American society, except that \"half-cocked\" is safer, as firearms go, than fully-cocked. The gun can't go off yet at half cock.But Hillman's image is simply underscoring his point about 1) lack of a fully-thought-out solution (I like his honesty in knowing he doesn't have a solution for everything) and 2) his relative lack of power against, well, the \"big guns,\" the power structure. He goes on:You see, one of the ways you get trapped into not going into the world is when people--usually in positions of power--say, \"Oh, yeah, wise guy?\" What would you do about it? What would you do about the Persian Gulf crisis?\" I don't know what I'd do. I don't know. But I know when I feel something is wrong, and I trust that sense of outrage, that sense of insult. And so, empty protest is a valid way of expressing feeling, politically. Remember, that's where we began: how do you connect feeling with politics? Well, one of the ways is through that empty protest. You don't know what's right, but you know what's wrong.I love that: his encouragement to express the feeling, openly, that something is wrong. His own willingness to express outrage, to speak up. We know, from history, what awful things can happen when people sense something wrong but don't speak up.But, yes, the powers that be are always telling us to shut up, in subtle or overt ways.So I'm going to keep speaking up when I feel that something is wrong. Even if I don't know what to do about it. Speaking up is a way to start (the ball rolling toward the kingpins)."},

There was outcry and weeping + human and animal empathy.A little while later, we figured out we could tuck the tiny (week old?), apparently uninjured rabbit back in its burrow (latex glove), cover it with dry grass and rabbit fur, see it snuggle in with siblings, and wait for the mother, who had been hanging around for an opportunity, to come back.We also blocked a hole in the fence with bricks so Abby the Tiny Hunter would not come into our yard, poop, and gleefully escape into other yards through other openings to randomly hunt the neighbors' rabbits. We knew exactly where she tends to get into this yard because she had left one of her (hated) hair bows, a tiny blue and white one, at the spot.This afternoon and this evening, I am indeed going to theatre, Heartland Theatre, to make theme of the day, Drama, complete. Young at Heartland, the senior acting troupe, this afternoon, and the 10-Minute Plays tonight, if they have room.I will be wearing the same dramatic theatre-going outfit to both plays: wild jungle floral print dress (from Goodwill via Kim!), floral Chinese slippers, and 3D zebras in my ears.And, to make it a true Random Coinciday, that's the Salade Nicoise with local greens I fed my mom yesterday.

Two are in the feature.I'm tickled by the nearness of last names in the paired artist, Saana Wang, whose bed you see here, and window below. I paired them when I saw the photo of the little girl with white \"doll\" face; it strikes with and against \"Hinamatsuri (The Doll's Festival)\" like a sad gong.Yesterday my husband pulled into the driveway, had a quick lunch, and was headed back to work when he saw the flat tire. Jacked up the car to relieve the burden on the wheel, took my car back to work, and attempted the repair later. Tire was shot. We were so lucky it didn't blow on the road to or from Chicago! So lucky it didn't spoil the day of college-campus and zoo visits! So lucky it didn't make us late for the surprise party! So lucky it didn't inconvenience the friends with whom we were staying. So lucky!So on this hump of the week, we'll get a new tire.And the mini-scones (Ticklepenny Corner, from yesterday's Farmers Market) were devoured by teenagers! This is good, as I am now keeping a food diary. I am making sure I eat healthy things by writing it down, inspired by my sister-in-law who said, \"You think, 'Do I really want to write that down?'\" (to show to the nutritionist, trainer, doctor, or self).My doctor will probably look at it and say, \"You do realize that coffee and wine don't really have that much nutritional value?\"And I'll say, \"What about coconut M&Ms?\"Food diary thus far today: coffee, nectarine.So there."},

I passed the dry creekbed on the way to the Farmers Market, where I got mixed greens for dinner, 3 fabulous zucchini, snowpeas, and glorious mini-scones from a local kitchen--literally, a kitchen!--called Ticklepenny Corner, and heard some live folk music. The Ticklepenny women will only be selling at the Farmers Market. I also saw Trish the pie lady, to say hello, but did not buy a pie.  (I was walking...but there were mini-pies, but I thought I should support the new Ticklepenny ladies.  Anyhoo...I will get a pie from Trish another day.) Sweet brief conversation with the man buying a strawberry rhubarb pie, the kind his wife used to make, but \"she's no longer with us.\" He was tempted to buy a mini sour cream apple pie, a snack for the ride home, but, in the scheme of things, it was too expensive. The giant strawberry rhubarb pie was a better bargain. With added nostalgia.The greens woman said, \"We're not certified organic, because I don't like the organic chemicals and the $1500 fee.  Chemicals are chemicals. We don't put anything on them.\" Just like me. So I washed them, and we ate them. The greens, chemical-free.Meanwhile, I have been feeding the baby and teenage rabbits...um, my greens, the lupine I planted from seed. Everything had been coming up so nicely but sometimes disappearing. So I put up a little wire fence. Keeps the big fat rabbits out just fine. But lets in the little ones, who are not a weensy bit scared of me when I approach with a watering can.They don't touch the balsam, though.

Gullible is my middle name.But the red panda does look a bit like a fox, and a bit like a squirrel, and a lot like a raccoon, and a little (the middle, black part) like a bear, and sort of like a cat, especially when grooming. One of its names is \"shining cat.\"Thanks to Greg Hume for this red panda descending a tree, and to Wikipedia for both of these free-use images.We were also celebrating the 50th birthday of an old friend, and saw many other old friends, as well as new friends, at her surprise party, along with all her siblings.

{"title": "Swimming in 'Shrooms", "date": "Thursday, June 7, 2012", "text": "This morning I started my summer lap swimming again! Wooee! I would have started Monday except for morning rain, distant thunder, and a temporary mix-up re: what the heck day is it? I was convinced that it was still June 3, and my receipt said that lap swim began on June 4. Yes, yes, I am number challenged and day-of-the-week challenged.Then I strained my back lifting big dresser drawers full of clothes, which reminded me why I go so long without cleaning out the dresser drawers. (Bend the knees, bend the knees. I did. It's just the awkward bigness of these particular drawers.) I can swim with a strained back; it's just hard to get in and out of the pool! So I rested, and started today. Oh, joy! Oh, thrill. I love the water and gliding through it.I have been gliding through The Omnivore's Dilemma, by Michael Pollan, since last summer. I love reading this book, and have learned so much from it, but I kept reading it in spurts at just the right time. Also, I have to have my notebook or journal handy, as I keep writing stuff down from it and riffing on it. It has inspired several poems and numerous informal short essays in my private journal and public blog.I also loved Pollan's book The Botany of Desire, which is actually mentioned in my poem, \"The Apple,\" in Blood Lotus #20 (p.37), and gave me tulip info for a poem called \"Tulips\" in After Hours #17. The Omnivore's Dilemma--the section on corn (zea mays)--was on my mind when I wrote \"Cassandra Observes the Midwestern in September,\" in Arsenic Lobster. (Also, it was September, and I was observing the Midwestern landscape.)Yesterday, moving toward the book's conclusion in \"the perfect meal,\" I was struck by many things Pollan said about hunters and foragers that apply to 1) being an artist and 2) being human. So I wrote them down.Speaking of true \"mushroomers,\" people who live in their vans and follow the mushrooms the way birders follow the birds (see The Big Year!), Pollan says, \"They cobble together a living selling their mushrooms to brokers who set up shop in motel rooms near the forests, post signs, and pay the hunters in cash. Anthony and Ben [chefs who are taking Pollan on a mushroom expedition] aren't really a part of this world; they hold jobs, live in houses, and sell their mushrooms directly to restaurants. 'We don't think of ourselves as professionals yet,' Anthony said.\"This wowed me. Anthony and Ben, who \"hold jobs, live in houses, and sell...directly...\" don't think of themselves as \"professionals.\" They think of the guys living in vans as professionals. The guys who are fully committed to mushrooming and who risk everything!Likewise, poets and artists, musicians and actors often cobble together their lives, taking what work they can find in their fields, committing fully, and risking everything. Their erratic schedules doing what they do best don't always allow them to \"hold jobs,\" but I'm glad most of them can find a way to live in apartments, at least, though I know it's sometimes someone else's apartment and, yes, sometimes it's their cars. For a time.I am very glad to be living in a house while cobbling a life together. And lap swimming. More gratitude.***And specific thanks to Wikipedia for the mushroom photos! Lactarius indigo by Dan Molter, for the blue stripes that are like lap swimming; Michael Maggs for the traditional red polka-dotted gnomish Disneyesque toadstool, Amanita muscaria; and Alan Rockefeller for the hallucinogenic Psilocybe zapotecorum.

It was a famous Paul Celan poem, and we were given a vocabulary list with some translated words, and I could recognize nouns as capitalized, etc., but I was basically in the dark.So I wrote several \"translations,\" put two together, and kept revising till I got this, \"After Celan.\" I love the desolate image the editors have paired with it, the two main buildings like the two sections of the poem, the blue car having something lurking about it, like a predatory animal.My fumbling with the language reminded me of the story of JFK supposedly accidentally calling himself a jelly donut in a famous speech in Berlin, but it sounds like that incident is mainly misunderstood, too. You can read all about it here, at Wikipedia, of course, which also offers the fine image of a Berliner Pfannkuchen, the pastry you see above.Speaking of misunderstandings, THIS has a call for submissions for work on the theme of \"Misreading.\"And, if you are looking to get more involved with an online magazine, they need a Columns Editor and a Fiction Editor, both unpaid positions, as are most literary editor positions.Overheard in my house last night: \"I don't see any donuts.\" (In a slightly accusatory tone.) There had been a vague promise of a late-night donut run based on early rising for a volleyball-tournament trip to north of Chicago today...  Instead, the volleyball coach husband/father of the household ate the last bagel.

{"title": "A Wicked Apple", "date": "Wednesday, May 23, 2012", "text": "New review up in the EIL Blog of Escape Into Life, where I do something related to poetry every other Wednes-day. This is a mini-review of Susan Slaviero's chapbook, A Wicked Apple (Hyacinth Girl Press, 2011).The fabulous art is by Chiarina Loggia, works called Enchanted and Here I Am, which get at the fairy tale twists and presence of reality in Slaviero's poems. Another work that ties in and features the red mirror is called Will You Look in the Mirror?I tend to be fascinated by re-tellings of myth and fairy tale, even though people keep doing it. Like the originals, which got told and told, the newer versions still have a pull. I note that late-20th and early-21st-century versions keep warning against ingenue status, favoring the tougher woman with a bit of witch in her to survive. Or at least without as much passivity or gullibility.Somehow this relates, ironically, to my career as an actress, so often playing the ingenue (or, if less than virginal, the saloon girl with a heart of gold, and shiny yellow dress, and fishnets). Anyhoo, just like lots of little girls hearing and reading fairy tales, I had yearned to be a beautiful princess but never was one in real life! My mom threw in \"The Ugly Duckling\" among the fairy tales, promising me I'd be all right when I grew up, and somehow getting across the swan-is-a-swan-not-a-duck message in just be-what-you-are ways, too, not about superficial beauty (though that was still what I wanted at the time). Then, growing up, aauugh: stringy hair, braces, pimples, pudginess, not the cover girl on Seventeen. No swan there. When I became an actress, the princessy roles came my way, and people who knew me then always assumed I'd been the blonde, blue-eyed pretty one all my life. Nope.So when I look in the mirror, I don't know what the heck I'm seeing.But Chiarina Loggia does!"},

{"title": "Not a Psychopath", "date": "Saturday, May 19, 2012", "text": "I loved this book, The Psychopath Test, by Jon Ronson, a \"madcap journey\" indeed. I learned a lot, and it was funny. Just like the author, and probably all medical/psychology students, I was self-diagnosing, but I am not a psychopath. Neither is he.It does seem possible that lots of tyrants and heads of companies would pass the psychopath test. Next up: All the Devils Are Here.But I want everyone in my house to read this one before I take it back to the library.I appreciate how the author takes up the issue of diagnosis and over-diagnosis, seeing both sides. Quoting Allen Francis: \"There's a societal push for conformity in all ways....There's less tolerance of difference.\"This always surprises me, given the age of Political Correctness, the tolerance we are relentlessly encouraged to bestow, all the celebration of \"diversity,\" and the real compassion and kindness and respect for human rights I see so often around me. I guess the point here is that difference is tolerated in terms of \"political identity\" but not if your way of being human breaks the conventions too much.On the other hand, as Francis continues, \"And so maybe for some people having a label is better. It can confer a sense of hope and direction. 'Previously I was laughed at, I was picked on, no one liked me, but now I can talk to fellow bipolar sufferers on the Internet and no longer feel alone.'\"Yes, if there is a name for what is wrong with you and a legitimate reason for your behavior, you are, perhaps, more accepted, can find your own, can fit into the larger community, thus labeled, can be treated and accommodated. Although I don't see labels as stopping bullies from bullying. Oops, I just labeled bullies, who are sometimes psychopaths.But Francis immediately says that the diagnosis of childhood bipolar disorder is not good. It's a label for life, and it is probably a mistake. And probably an excuse to give medications. And even the originator of the DSM (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, about which there is always plenty of controversy), Robert Spitzer, does not like to speculate on the mistakes that may arise from it, in which ordinary behaviors may have been labeled mental disorders.I read an article recently on how there is no sympathy for the parents of psychopaths. Other people who have children with various disorders get plenty of sympathy, but not these. And psychopaths have a problem with the amygdala. It's not the parents' fault, though, of course, they might aggravate the situation or not deal with the problem.But it's the psychopaths themselves that are and have the problem. Looks like we all need to spot them, guard ourselves against them, and not continue to let them bully the world or individuals in it. But we'll have to do this with the empathy we feel...and they don't. Ouch."},

I am going back out in it.I had walked into town for a meeting, thinking maybe I would stop by the library on my way home to see if The Psychopath Test, by Jon Ronson, is in yet, but I got a ride home from my mom, which gave me a wee bit of chatting time with her. Came home to the email saying the book is in, so I have a perfect excuse to do more walking.Ah, but I had just started, finally, A Story Like the Wind, by Laurens van der Post, and that is going to be hard to set aside. Fortunately, I am only on page 9, so I can easily start over again if I don't read these simultaneously. I am re-reading Olive Kitteridge, too, before book group meets, and I notice, over at Goodreads, that I am in the middle of a couple of other books, too! But I have to read things at just the right time!And place. And van der Post can come to the beach with me, perhaps!Anyhoo, I stopped in here to show you this Sprouted Onion by Jonathon Koch, just arrived in email. And to tell you I tried another Salade Niçoise, this time with tuna and green beans, and it was delicious. And green onions.When my onions sprout, I try to plant them, by tossing them into the yard. I planted my sprouted garlic by putting it in a hole and watering it. We'll see. This same hole previously held a sprouted carrot...pulled up by squirrels.Email also had the good news of the acceptance of 2 (sprouted!?) poems, so a good Random Coinciday all around."},

It's true I've used the colloquialism, \"I'm starving,\" to mean \"I'm really hungry,\" but that was more when I was younger and not thinking in the larger context. I try not to do that now.But I was struck by the short story \"Starving,\" inside the novel-in-stories Olive Kitteridge, by Elizabeth Strout, when Olive says to a young woman who is truly starving, from anorexia nervosa, \"We're all starving,\" meaning emotionally. Or spiritually. We are all hungry for something we lack.\"Why do you think I eat every doughnut in sight?\" she asks the young woman, who gets it. Sympathy and empathy are achieved.Looking for art to pair with Kristine Snodgrass's poems for the current feature at Escape Into Life, I was struck with how Lee Price is dealing with women's relationship with food in her paintings. Here is her EIL feature, with an artistic statement about that.And the Snodgrass poems also have something wonderfully obsessive about them, with a Gertrude Stein-like repetitiveness, and an odd mix of calm and chaos, of the sort Lee Price is creating, too, in her paintings. What a lucky match this time.Above, Lemon Meringue, by Lee Price. Below, Strawberry Shortcake III."},

She wears high heels and wants to live in the city. He wants to live in the country and shop for fertilizer. I won't give away any more of the domestic secrets of these two endearing speakers, but I do want to quote from the poem \"Ars Poetica,\" that's like the avocado pit heart of the book:On the walls of my work room, I hung aframed, poster-sized copy of the periodictable...                                        ...When I feelunfocussed, I try to name a random element...***Chemists took time to name elements withsuch little purpose or quantity like number75, Rhenium. I had to look it up. A rareitem extracted from other materials to makesuper alloys primarily used in jet engineparts. Someone took the time to findRhenium, to name it, measure it, to findsome purpose for it. Then I can begin.I love the patience and focus here, the way the speaker can center herself with a kind of compassion for the rare, unsung element, and then apply this to her own work.You can explore more of her work here at her website and blog, and at the marvelous \"nesting site\" of Referential Magazine, where I get joyfully lost for a while each time I visit!"},

Mom found some impatiens for her shady areas. And I got a variety of lovely little plants for my hanging pots: asparagus fern, a purple lobelia, delicate white euphorbia, and yellow and white lantana (which I hear grows like a weed in Australia). The idea of the pots is that 1) the rabbits won't eat these delicacies as they hang from the eaves 2) the squirrels, likewise, can't dig in the pots, burying their treasure and kicking up the plants.And beauty.Planning to get together with my mom on Sunday, too, to talk poetry!!"},

I felt addressed! I felt connected to her. \"This could be my song!\" I was thinking.I kept listening and driving in the beautiful, blue sky day, figuring Jon Norton of WGLT Jazz would eventually repeat the song title and tell me who was singing it. But then all sound stopped, and some alarming noises came out of the radio, and, worse than technical problems, it was an Amber Alert! Two babies kidnapped by their \"non-custodial mother.\"  That could make anyone hopelessly blue.Hoping these kids will be safe & loved.What I was hearing, without knowing, was a really famous Beach Boys song, by Brian Wilson and Tony Asher, called \"I Just Wasn't Made for These Times,\" but it was sung by Kat Edmonson, so that's why I was so strongly identifying. Her pacing, her mellow melancholy.The lyrics come out a certain way from her, making it quite different from the Beach Boys rendition.It's from her new album, Way Down Low, which also has a song called \"Hopelessly Blue\" on it.Meanwhile, my spiderwort is blooming, gloriously blue.

There's an open mic afterwards, so you can read, too.I'm very glad of our \"eat local\" and \"shop local\" and \"good to go\" (environmentally responsible, sustainable commuter challenge) local programs for healthy, socially aware living. Going to area theatre and literary readings is a way to \"listen local\" and support your homegrown artists. Likewise, with the visual artists. \"See local.\" Let's do it!In this case, Kathryn and I like to appear together now and then to prove we are not the same person. Our names are so similar, and we both write poetry, and we've done some of the same things--Illinois State Writing Project at ISU, AWP Conferences in Chicago, college teaching, chapbook publication--that sometimes people think we are each other. And, of course, we are both \"local poets.\"Coincidentally, I just finished Olive Kitteridge, by Elizabeth Strout, which I read for my local book group. The New York Times book review of it is titled \"The Locals,\" as it's about people in a small town in Maine. I loved this book, a tender look at the tough lives of regular people. I've been wanting to read it for a long time and was glad the library had the hardback with a leaf on the cover.It's like Winesburg, Ohio, by Sherwood Anderson, in being a novel-in-stories or short-story-cycle held together by a central character whose life intersects with other lives in the town, and in revealing the \"quiet desperation\" of many lives, and the quiet joy. It helps you understand your neighbors better, and yourself.Also by chance, I read a short article by Augusten Burroughs this morning (thanks for posting it at Facebook, Sarah Sloat!) that connects with these two books in presenting the common, shared unhappiness of people, that some unhappiness is part of a normal life and that we can't all always be relentlessly cheerful despite the current trend to be always, always, always \"positive.\" \"How to Live Unhappily Ever After\" appears to be an adapted excerpt from Burroughs's newest book, coming out this month.But I imagine our local poetry reading will have a mix of humor, tenderness, beauty, awe, intense observation of human and animal life, ordinary speech, and, perhaps, \"local color.\""},

In that movie, basedon a book (a roman àclef, ack, the kind I sort of hate, except when I love them, but I haven’tread this one), a young woman starts out with inner beauty and ends up with itagain, but the bulk of the movie—containing her fashion makeover andthe “dragon lady” boss woman editor of RunwayMagazine that we love to hate—is all about external beauty.“Oh, sure,” says the Stanley Tucci character of Nigel, “thisis a multi-billion dollar industry based on…inner beauty.” He is mockingAndrea, pre-makeover, for having a hard time as the personal assistant to afashionmonger.Next, we watch him re-dress Andrea in designer clothes, withdesigner accessories, until a professional model can say, honestly, “You lookgood.”And isn’t part of the fun of this movie that we get to seeher “look good” right before she returns to inner beauty? Maybe she will retain her new sense of style, but she’s giving allthe designer clothes back. Maybe shewill continue to cut her hair this way, but maybe not, based on her restoredpriorities, her low salary, and her lack of a built-in “beauty department” atwork. I have a feeling she won’t keep wearing spike heels.And, of course, we wouldn’t be happy with the ending of themovie if the main character didn’t get to “make good”—get a new job—or bewatching the movie at all if the author of the roman à clef didn’t “make good” by writing abestselling novel based on her experience as the personal assistant to ahigh-powered woman in the fashion world.Do we really value inner beauty? Or do we just keeprepeating platitudes about it until somebody “makes good”?"},

Fold up a poem and stick it in your pocket!

(I am likely to do more gardening, so I hope I remembered to take the rolled-up poem out before I launder these jeans.)I clipped it from an old issue (Fall 2009) of American Concierge Magazine, a classy glossy handed out free in hotels that uses poetry as filler (a grand old tradition) in a lovely pocket-like feature called \"Pause for Poetry\" slipped in among the ads. (Holy moly, look at the little river of \"pockets\" in the paragraph above!) Anyhoo, I am delighted to appear in American Concierge, in this instance across from a picture of Maggie Miley's Irish Coffee, and a recipe for it, and katty-korner down from a picture of swirled coffee from the Coffee Hound. Of course, my poem, \"What I'd Tell You,\" very romantic and sad, is directly under an ad for Allied Waste of Bloomington, Illinois. But there is no picture of that.Speaking of pictures, here is a picture of early pockets, reminding us 1) of pocketbooks and 2) that men and women wore them 3) even while threshing.I've also clipped my poem \"On the Back of the Seed Packet\" from the current issue, Spring 2012, of American Concierge, to have handy in another pocket or for Poem in Your Pocket day next year. I was surprised and delighted that the editor picked this one, as it has sadness and darkness in it and this is a cheerful magazine, full of things to do in town for people in hotels looking for something to do.On the other hand, these are people in hotel rooms, pausing for poetry.On the Back of theSeed Packet Behind each poem you must have some sufferingthey can trace to your daily lifeor another way to dismiss the truth of shared suffering.If you try to hide your sadness & show the shining path to joy, they will call you sentimentalbecause they are afraid of how easy it is, and how hard.Now that you know this, your own deep sufferingshall be as roofer’s nailspounding through heart and gut, top of head, soles of feet,to be hidden while you walk beside the fencedropping moonflower seedsfor a fragrant night blooming vine."},

Submissions to Adanna must reflect women’s issues or topics, celebrate womanhood, and shout out in passion. *It's cool that Granta, a magazine my folks love and gave me a subscrip-tion to, represents men and women writers pretty equally, this year swinging toward the women!"},

{"title": "Salome", "date": "Thursday, April 12, 2012", "text": "On Easter Sunday, Pastor Bob spoke of Salome as being one of the women who fled the tomb, afraid, after seeing that the stone had been rolled away and Jesus was gone. I asked if this was the same Salome who had asked for the head of John the Baptist on a plate.Since Jesus and John the Baptist were contemporaries, this didn’t seem too far-fetched for me, and it led me on a riff about repentance.*Bob didn’t know, and both of us were intrigued. So I have taken it upon myself to find out. The short answer is no--thanks, of course, to Wikipedia. The real answer, as usual, is a bit more complicated and stickier to find out, partly because a lot of people have the same names and partly because some history is really legend. Along the way, I learned that Jesus had a sister named Salome. And that this would be a weird Random Coinciday in the blog.I admitted to Bob that I mainly know Salome from the Dance of the Seven Veils. That is, I often get my religion through literature, in this case Oscar Wilde’s play, Salome, and the operas and cultural depictions since of Salome as a femme fatale.Salome danced for Herod at his request, and he offered her whatever she wanted in return. In some fictional accounts, she wants John’s head because she desires him and he spurned her advances, or she wants to impress another potential (sophist) lover. Ew. That guy is not impressed by the head and goes back to Plato.In a Biblical account, Salome’s mother tells her to ask for John’s head, because the mom is mad at John for saying her marriage to Herod, her first husband’s brother, is unlawful; she divorced her first husband to remarry. Yes, this is the same Herod whose actions led to the death of Jesus. And this Herod is the son of “Herod the Great,” the King Herod associated with the massacre of the innocents (children under two when Jesus was a child), but apparently he really just massacred his own family, pretty common among dictators of the past, alas, in various cultures, including Cleopatra’s.**And in an apocryphal version, it’s not John’s head but Herod (the Great?)’s daughter Herodias’s head (did all these people marry their brothers and sisters? oh, um, yes, re: Cleopatra and various mythical gods and goddesses responsible for the creation of the world), and she was playing on the ice, fell through, and her head remained on the ice, which reminds me of stuff in the Jane Campion film, In the Cut.****If Salome, after asking for the head of John the Baptist, repented and became a follower or disciple of Jesus, present at the crucifixion and at the resurrection, then, wow, cool. Alas, it is a different person. But my insight still holds: we can only repent of what wrong we ourselves have done, not wrong done to us. Only the perpetrator of that wrong or harm can repent of that.  Unfortunately, we often take on the shame and blame for the harm done to us because the wrongdoer is neither willing nor able to do so, and society, too scared to go after the wrongdoer, or finding that too difficult to do, joins in, piling shame and blame on the victim, the one who has been damaged.This is not a new insight. And it certainly happens. What intrigued me was the thought that Salome, who had done wrong, even if urged unto it by her mother, might have repented and spent the rest of her life doing good. Nope.**random coincidence***random coincidence starring Meg Ryan and Mark Ruffalo, involving ice skating and a “disambiguated” head. In Wikipedia, disambiguation means separating one use/meaning of a word from another (to avoid ambiguity). In In the Cut, it means separating a head from the body, in police jargon. This is pertinent because Meg Ryan’s character, a poet, who reads short poems on public transit intermittently throughout the film, is researching word meaning, specifically slang. Oh, wait, no! It's a \"disarticulated\" head, not a \"disambiguated\" head, but that's still about language, speech, words, meaning. And, boy, did my origami brain enjoy that brief misapprehension.Have I mentioned how much I love Mark Ruffalo (rhymes with “buffalo”)?Salome art by Titian, Gustave Moreau, and Aubrey Beards-ley. Buffalo thanks to the United States Department of Agriculture."},

{"title": "Irresistible Grace", "date": "Thursday, April 5, 2012", "text": "OK, here is the insight I promised at the end of Répondez s’il vous plaît. In a comment, I warned Seana that it might have something to do with Calvinism (or reformed Calvinism, or Calvinism as it is commonly...um, misunderstood, according to Marilynne Robinson, but that's another story), and it might. Or it might not.But even Wikipedia understands that Calvinism understood as a response to the 5 points of Arminian Remonstrance has little to do with Jean Couvin (aka John Calvin), as \"Calvin died in 1564 and Jacob Arminias was born in 1560.\" (Still with me, Seana? Anyone?)Anyhoo, I was realizing on Cranky Doodle Day that not only must I live peacefully and patiently without hope of reward, which I mainly do because there so seldom is one, and, of course, for philosophical and spiritual reasons and because I am nonlinear, but also I must live patiently and non-crankily without hope of response.Likewise. Because there so seldom is one.Even though not responding seems sort of ungenerous and unpolite, people have their own reasons for doing that, which have nothing to do with me. I have to just get on with it. I can be momentarily annoyed, and forgive myself for that, and then be as responsive and as patient and polite as I, personally, can possibly be, because that is who I am and who I want to be. If I behave badly in response to...the lack of responseAck! My head exploded.But, to speak Calvinistically, I have to work to be who I am and I have to choose to be, um, chosen for grace, even if I am not, and even if I am. Head is trembling...*I have to try to do the gracious thing even if people are ungracious toward me. Because...? I am hard-wired that way? I was raised that way?

I use it perhaps to illustrate the abundance in my life right (joy, spring bloom) and the tartness, as I was pondering something that tends to make me cranky.Aha! That makes it a Cranky Doodle Day as well as a Fat Tuesday in the blog.Why do I always feel a little guilty for leaving out Cranky Doodle Day? It's good not to be cranky, right? Um, remember Bright-Sided, by Barbara Ehrenreich? Yes! Because I just returned it to the library. Well, hey, sometimes crankiness and complaining is good because it 1) points out crap 2) can lead to change 3) is part of real life, not falsely optimistic oversimplified unreal life. OK, that got me in the mood to crank!So, what was making me cranky was the lack of response in several areas of my life. I won't go into it too much, but some is in personal relationships, and I can handle that in 1) risky conversation and 2) poetry. In fact, while today's poem-a-day prompt is \"a particular kind of tree,\" the title of the poem I got from that is actually \"Répondez s’il vous plaît.\"Aha! That makes it also a Random Coinciday in the blog.Anyhoo,...hmm, by now I am perfectly cheerful and have lost all crankiness, but I'll still try to crank it up. Yes! One of my poetry workshop participants was lamenting the lack of response to some of her submissions, and I'm sure a number of you can identify with that. I got a response today to a submission. It was a rejection! But even that doesn't bother me.What bothers me is when a person (or organization) only contacts me when they want something from me. And they want it right now.But if I need something from him or her or them, there is often no response. Usually, I just need more info, some kind of clarification, etc. If it has to do with what the person wants right now, I might get a response, so that I will give the person what he/she wants right now. If it is information that is important to me but not deemed important or urgent by that person...I will probably not hear back at all.Or there will be a long silence.Sigh...Was that cranky enough?

{"title": "Bird on Glass, 3.", "date": "Saturday, March 31, 2012", "text": "I hope this is the last “bird on glass” entry, for the sake of the birds! (No birds were harmed in the writing of these blog entries: Bird on Glass, Bird on Glass, 2.) But it might not be.In a comment on “Cool Snap,” Carol said that “it's always somehow surprising and informative for us novice poets to hear someone more established getting rejected as well,” and I was surprised to be considered “established,” since I don’t feel very established. Hence, that “outside looking in” feeling.I joked back that I am not part of “the establishment” and am old enough not to trust it (my kids think their parents are hippies—I’m a weensy bit too young to be a true hippy, but I have a hippy spirit), all the while aware that a younger generation of poets is joyfully engaged in kicking an older generation of poets out of here 1) until they die, when it’s OK to revere them or 2) unless they were beloved mentors or teachers, and it’s wise and good to love and respect them.  I hope my own joyful, joking tone is coming through, not just the cynical awareness. In me, most things are sifted, blended. Makes for very fine pancakes. Drenched with pure maple syrup, or Cary’s sugar free. And a few burnt ones.Anyhoo, I get rejected along with the best/rest of us, yes. No string of past publications makes the next poem any more likely to get accepted. The poem must speak for itself and get itself accepted, and that will also be a matter of the tastes, preferences, judgment, and needs of the editor or publication to which I have sent it. I hope to have sent to the right place, by reading the publication or samples from it, and the guidelines, but I can’t know the literary journal’s individual needs at this moment. That understanding of the process (aided by years of being on the other side, the editors’ side) and that conviction that the poem is more important than the poet’s name or resume helps me move on from the momentary pang of rejection, which is as brief and routine (and annoying and necessary) as, I imagine, pricking the finger to check one’s blood sugar. I have been so lucky to learn so much by working for a time with 3 publications: Poetry East (where I was associate editor in graduate school), RHINO (where I was with a group of editors for a decade), and Escape Into Life (where I get to read poets at large in the world and choose some to feature every couple of weeks, to share with online readers). Part of what I learned is that a jillion people are writing poems in this world, sharing their hearts, minds, and skills. I am amazed and full of respect for these poets. I like all kinds of poems. I am impressed most by those who take care, who respect the world and the poetic process (and the submission process), and who find a way to “tell it like it is” in their work. There are a jillion ways to do this.But I remain alone and at large in the world myself, not connected to some group or cultural institution that supports me, morally or practically, not part of any establishment. And, as you well know if you are a poet, the world doesn’t tend to value or respect poets on a daily basis. American culture pushes us to the frivolous fringe; we are not contributing to the economy in important ways. Etc.But we know our own value, yes?  “So,” to quote Emily Dickinson, “let us keep fast hold of hands, please, that, when the birds begin, none of us be missing.”"},
{"title": "Bird on Glass, 2.", "date": "Thursday, March 29, 2012", "text": "Ruth wanted to know more about my “bird on glass” feeling earlier this month, and I have continued to ponder it. It’s that “outside looking in” feeling of alienation or distance, at times a longing to belong.Oddly, I felt it on a day of being inside looking out.  Only the metaphorical (but based on literal) bird was looking in, and not really. The bird was seeing the reflection of the sky, not wanting to come in or to belong to any human group. Just mistaken and confused.Of course, Plato’s cave is pertinent here.  If we are inside one way of looking at things (the cave) and learn that all we are seeing is a reflection flickering on the cave wall, we’d have to realize and turn around to be able to walk out through the mouth of the cave into the true world.  Likewise, if the bird could just turn around, she would see more sky, more trees, and her true home. Yes?Why do we get confused and bang our heads on the wall, or our wings on the glass? Yes, it can lead to death! The bird’s death, the heart’s death, the death of the soul perhaps. Or the dulling of the mind, the numbing of our existence.My dad turns 80 in a couple days, and I was just telling him how he has comforted me during my moments of alienation, reminding me that my true community includes the dead, and people in the future, people not now living but who have written things down or painted things. Yes, the writers and artists are no doubt my true community. (And his.)  Especially the writers, but I am married to an artist, and I drew before I wrote, so I feel an affinity there, for sure.In the recent tributes to Adrienne Rich, I encountered this quotation: “You must write, and read, as if your life depended on it.” I do. It does. Reading and writing are my natural activities, my (good!) habits of being. But it’s true that we are living in a time of quick info, often gained through quick visuals, sound bites, quick, too-quick, and often dubious “facts,” some of which (in the political arena) are outright lies. Very little paying attention and sustained attentiveness going on and rigorous attachment to what is real or true here. So that probably intensifies my “bird on glass” feeling. Though I am part of a natural world, I am not part of this “new” world. And it is hard and shiny.Mostly, though, I simply feel the slight distance of the artist, the person standing on the edge and looking, listening, paying attention. I’m not eavesdropping on purpose or to use anything I hear in a harmful way. I just understand that I am not in the “in” group at hand or of much interest to them. I am what I am, and it’s hard to explain to people who are not really interested.“What are you up to these days?”“I have a rich inner life.”See what I mean? (It’s OK to laugh. I do.) But I see the irony here, too. In my answer, alas, they are on the outside looking in, and not able to see what I am up to because it is part of the inner life. (Although I do make it outer in my writing.)Then again, as I said, they are seldom really interested. Not in my inner life, anyway. I hope they are interested in their own!I love this piece on vulnerability in Maureen’s blog today. Partly because I imagine many people feel vulnerable and have rich inner lives, and that if we could connect, share, respect and protect each other, truly pay attention to each other, many feelings of alienation would fade….And I have to say, I do feel I belong to a community here, of people who read, write, and care about each other. Thanks. And thanks again, to artist Pamela Callahan, for her birds."},

So, time to find the right homes for some lonely strays.Audrey Hepburn is cool! Love in the Afternoon. And another rose from my daughter."},

Unrelated, but probably both related to students. Two were walking behind me, noticing and commenting on the handcuffing incident, and I turned to ask them about it, but they were just witnesses from afar, like me.\"He came out of the apartments,\" they said. They had just come out of a CVS under these apartments. Later, closer to church, the birthday greeting was in front of another set of student apartments and visible from a dormitory.In church I learned of the unrelated deaths of two students on Friday night, found in their residence halls. Heart goes out to their parents, friends, to all affected.So much heartache, so much trouble. Side by side with so much joy, so much com-passion.Take a look at this short account of Mather Schneider's book, He Took a Cab, in the new issue of Prick of the Spindle. (I'm the Poetry Cheerleader again.) Then take a look at his book. It's an education in being human.Ah, and, in church, to celebrate Women's History Month, pastor Susan gave an account of Margaret Sanger, who gave us birth control (Thank you!), and, at Susan's request, I read this poem, \"Unauthorized Version,\" by U. A. Fanthorpe, a New Zealand poet, setting the record straight in the persona of Mary, sister of Martha.Rose pix taken by my daughter. (Thank you!)"},

I told him I was headed to a talk in the afternoon, by Greg Koos, director of the McLean County Museum of History, about the opening of the new exhibit on Irish history, The Greening of the Prairie: Irish Immigration and Settlement in Mclean County, and he wanted to go, too! So he turned up at the talk, \"It's Not Easy Being Green,\" after a nice walk at, get this, Evergreen Lake!I visited with my mom and dad, taking Dad a copy of Poems & Plays, with three of my Cassandra poems in it, as his production of The Agamemnon fired my curiosity about and enhanced my understanding of the character of Cassandra, and because he likes them. Mom likes them, too. While she and I went to the talk at the museum, Dad was on the green! Meaning golf course!The talk was great, full of information and humor. And making clear how hard it was to Irish, in Ireland or the United States, at various times in history, notably the 1800s, as the Irish left their own country to settle here, to escape economic and religious persecution or the potato famine.As soon as I got home, my daughter wanted to go shopping for prom dresses. Sigh. It's not easy finding the perfect prom dress. My favorite was...2 shades of green! With sparkles. Her favorite...has not been found.Miss Piggy found hers, though.I have lots of fun on Slattern Day in the blog!"},

(Now potato salad.)It was overcast.Now, 2:00 p.m., the sun has come out, so I am going out.  Bye!But wait. Wasn't there an insight I hoped to share with you? Yes, it was about feeling on the outside looking in, confused, and odd. Like a bird banging itself against the sliding glass door. I do feel like that often, and recently. But why, if I'm a bird, would I want to get in? I am free! I can fly! I can sit on a branch and sing!So, as I said, out I go! To gaze again at those bleeding hearts."},

Products, recipes! Here, for instance, is the recipe for Chic Lemon Meringue Nests, and I'm sure these Orange Chantilly Cream-Filled Oranges are equally healthy and have more vitamin C.Anyway, I am trying to show you the colors of the sky this morning. The pinky clouds had orange in them.I am not trying to drive you crazy, though, so I will give you a tip: Click the button at the top/center of the PEEPS page, the one that says, \"Stop Music.\"Here's a yellow & chocolate-edged PEEPS topped cake that I like to call PEEPSamisu in my mind. Where is the recipe for that? And see how you can submit your own PEEPS recipes?!  Maybe I will make up something called Pink & Yellow PEEPS of the Sky that explodes in your microwave.And here is something I actually want to make, see up close, and eat: the PEEPS Sunflower Cake.Speaking of PEEPS, Denise Duhamel was delightful last night, reading her poetry. She has bright blonde hair.Afterwards, I walked over to the Ames Library to hear part of the Homerathon, sections read aloud in German, French, and English.  When I went back at 3:30 a.m. to do my stint in the wee hours, the library was locked, and a sign said they had already finished their marathon reading of The Odyssey. So, though I had my Fagels translation in hand, no one heard a peep of Homer out of me!This morning my white bleeding hearts bloomed exactly like yesterday's image!

I will be reading an English translation. At 4:14-4:30 a.m.  Yes. A.M. I frequently wake up at 3:ish a.m., so this will give me something classy to do at that hour.Both of these fine poetry events take place on the campus of Illinois Wesleyan University. Once again, it's wonderful to live in a two-university town (twin cities).Now I am going out to celebrate World Poetry Day by 1) writing a poem (I hope) 2) raking up sweetgumballs 3) continuing to be pelted by fragrant white blossoms 4) communing with the rabbits, as a jillion of them are out there hopping and eating.I hope they are not eating off the tiny blossoms of bleeding heart just about to open...."},

{"title": "Bright-Sided", "date": "Monday, March 19, 2012", "text": "It's been very bright & beautiful here, but now a Thor's Day kind of thunderstorm is rolling in on a Blue Monday in the blog. Over the past couple days, I've enjoyed reading Barbara Ehrenreich's book Bright-Sided: How the Relentless Promotion of Positive Thinking has Undermined America, and she supports her thesis very well.She's not saying that positive thinking is bad in itself. She's a remarkably cheerful person here, despite having had to suffer through the pink optimism associated with breast cancer, as well as the disease. What she objects to is the substitution of superstition and optimism for real information and real action in the real world, a world that remains complex despite so many people's effort to oversimplify it.And if you are constantly told that you won't be cured unless you are blindly optimistic, that's a bitter pink pill to take. It's not that positive thinking might not indeed help the healing process! It's that if you are not cured, you would be blamed for that. Meanwhile, carcinogens still go into the environment, thanks to big business practices. Meanwhile, mainstream state-of-the-art treatments for cancer continue to pour toxins into the body, etc.Ehrenreich acknowledges the real effectiveness of much positive thinking, so she's not blindly critical, either. She's just making it impossible to look away from the greed motives and ridiculous detachment from reality in much of the guru- and hunch-based motivational thinking of today, which relates to similar movements in history, all of which come back to bilking a blindsided bunch of wishful thinkers. She points to how the hugely successful megachurches are run with big-business motives, while, oddly, despite the surge of MBA programs, a number of companies are run by not very realistically-thinking guru types, who, she argues, helped push the country over the brink into the current economic abyss.So I recently re-viewed Yes Man, to see motivational speaker Terrence, played by the charismatic Terence Stamp, and Baby Mama, to see business guru Barry, played with giggle-producing calm intensity by Steve Martin, in action as the kind of money-making manipulators who benefit from blindsiding those around them with the need to be positive. I love how both films gently mock the gurus while demonstrating their undeniable success.One of the book's sentences that sticks in my mind as \"Most of the money is made at the back of the room\" (at motivational speaker events) is evidenced in the scene from Yes Man, where, even before Jim Carrey hears the great \"Yes!\" speaker, he's there buying books and DVDs in a labelled plastic shopping bag that continues the relentless promotion of positive thinking.Comedy is such a great way to criticize society. The viewer gets to laugh and make her own choices."},

It's still warm and soft today, but now overcast, which might make for a more pleasant walk or ride in the St. Patrick's Day parade about to start soon.I just visited the opening of the Irish history exhibit at the McLean County Museum of History, called The Greening of the Prairie: Irish Immigration and Settlement in McLean County.

It's probably in grocery store beef, too, but how would you know, as it's not required to be labeled...One problem with it is that it can contain E coli, but fear not, as it's treated with ammonium hydroxide to kill that. Not the same stuff you use to clean your kitchen, but still...a gas. It's all so gross, I am glad I continue to avoid red meat and to share my lettuce, celery, and apples with the rabbits and squirrels in the back yard. Whom I also do not plan to eat.I'm also cranky about mean-spirited, racist bumper stickers I've been seeing around town and on Facebook.

Other things are coming up, as well: tufts of columbine and bleeding heart, the little tongues of wild violet, buds on the clematis vine, tulips, iris, and day lily. Plus hydrangea, forsythia, and lilac are beginning their budding.It will be 80 degrees, perhaps, today, and I am tempted to do lots of yard work, but I also resist pulling off all the fall leaf cover because then the big fat rabbits will find and eat it all, getting bigger and fatter. I am OK with them eating some of it, but not all.So I plan a long walk on the trail into town to get some library books: Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close, by Jonathan Safran Foer, our next book-group book, and Bright-Sided by Barbara Ehrenreich, because, happy, optimistic, and joyful as I am, I am not blinded by the cheerful light, nor fooled by it, and I need a wise crone to tell it to me straight so I know I'm not crazy when my cynicism surges up.I do need sunglasses.Thanks to Karen Roe for the daffodil in England above, and to BerndH for the Narcissus pseudo-narcissus, a name that implies all that's making it a Cranky Doodle Day for me in the privacy of my own mind. That's why I'm going outdoors, to be in touch with reality and to let the big fat rabbits know I'm here."},

It was a joy to see some of the teams from all over the state, to know how hard they've worked. And I felt the pang of disappointment in many, also part of the learning process. Our region is a particularly tough and talented region, and we don't always make it out, so we feel for the talented players left behind at regionals this year. And KJHS is going to have a great 8th team next year, too, so watch out!The team came home with individual medals, a trophy for the trophy case, and a Rawlings game ball. I think the players will sign it, and it will go in the trophy case, too.Escape Into Life site maintenance is done, so I've done more AWP recap over there, at EIL at AWP.

Look for its spring issue to come out soon, and I'll have a new Poetry Cheerleader column up, reviewing Mather Schneider's book, He Took a Cab.

The girls and their parents appreciate and admire him, and he brings out the best in them. In the second game of the first match, he started several \"bench players,\" girls who have been improving all season in practice, and were ready now to perform, and they did. This was an appropriate risk to take against this particular team, and our girls won the match in two games. In the next match, which went all three games, the regular season starters went back in, rested and fed, and played at the top of their abilities against a well-matched challenger. Tight fight all the way through! Screaming final point on a spike. Yay!This morning it was darker driving my daughter to school, but spring is coming, more light, and it's already 55 out there and due to be in the 70s all week, we hear. I was driving straight into dark blue beauty, clouds opening, somehow perfect Blue Monday weather.I am a little blue, sort of that post-sickness lingering faint fatigue and post-thrill sighing release.

Jannett is a beautiful human being and poet who teaches economics at Bradley University in Peoria, and I was glad to make her acquaintance gradually over the years, as she attended the RHINO Poetry Forum when I facilitated it at the Normal Public Library. We took her work at RHINO and, since then, I was also able to feature her at Escape Into Life! Now here's this lovely book from Finishing Line Press, and it contains 2 of the EIL poems, \"Deal Breaker\" and \"Still Married,\" if you want a little sampler!And, yes, Jannett is someone I bumped into at AWP, in the Emily Dickinson session. David Baker, Carl Phillips, Ann Townsend, and Stanley Plumly looked at Emily's poems focusing on her birds, flowers, books, and obsessive topics. Fascinating!I'm over the \"conference crud\" and most of the AWP recap, but I will weave in other reactions and remembrances as I report on my reading. For instance, I am still reading Absence of Mind, by Marilynne Robinson, who spoke eloquently, during the Literature of Evil session, on literature as what can teach us compassion. And I will probably gush again about The Sun as I read the March and then the April issues, but I can say now what a privilege and thrill it was to hear the writers read their essays at AWP. I had read them all in advance, but here they were in the voices and with the facial expressions and emotional nuances of the writers themselves!Likewise, it was a thrill to hear Jannett read her work at the recent ekphrasis event at the McLean County Arts Center.

Of course! There were many, many poets, writers, and editors in the women's restroom after all events! The hotel even had the good sense to convert one of the men's restrooms, between floors, into a women's restroom! (Paper sign taped over metal plaque.)I'm surprised I didn't run into Donna Vorreyer, someone I've met online, and who recently led an ekphrasis workshop for RHINO, in the women's restroom, too. (She reading at the RHINO Release party on April 15, I see!) Or Grace Curtis, who called when my phone was off. Most of the time it was off, or I couldn't hear it. Anyhoo, the women's restroom was always busy, and I took care to thank the cheerful, harried, overworked, overwhelmed housekeeping staff!The rhinoceros is a fierce creature, lovable at a distance, in zoos, or in drawings, and constantly endangered, its horn sought as a medicine and sold in the black market. The legend is that rhino horn was an aphrodisiac, but probably it was always known for its curative potential. While it is used in making dagger handles, it is not really a bony thing, instead made of keratin, the same stuff as hair and nails, leading to this couplet from one of my nocturnes:Which rhinoceros lends its hornof matted hair to love?And this armored-looking fellow is a woodcut by Albrecht Durer."},

We'd finished dinner; the timing was perfect. I was so glad it was our neighborhood Girl Scout at the door, and not someone selling me siding. We ate some Thanks-A-Lot cookies, which have a thin fudge layer on one side and say \"thank you\" on the other in various languages.So this is a day I want to pause and say a big thank you to women all over the world working toward human rights and equality for women. This year's UN theme for the day is \"Empower Women--End Hunger and Poverty,\" so I feel acutely the irony of eating Girl Scout cookies in celebration. They are a luxury, but they do support a good cause. And I think they've gotten a little healthier: Thanks-A-Lot cookies have a little iron and no cholesterol."},

They were a delight and had clearly been drinking. This isn't gossip: Duffy referred to her margarita (not as good as the ones back home), and Levine spoke of being wined and dined well in Chicago, and how nice it was that somebody else (AWP) was paying!The alcohol is pertinent. While Levine gets an actual salary as Poet Laureate, Duffy claimed to be paid in sherry. She's not exactly joking. Even Wikipedia states that, in the U.K., \"The salary has varied, but traditionally includes some alcohol.\" It goes on to call this sack or Canary wine--a \"sack\" or fortified wine from the Canary Islands or \"Sherris sack\" from Spain, which is sherry.Carol Ann Duffy is Scottish, and just before I heard her read I was in a bar with some men in kilts. I praised them and found out they were about to play as the opening band for The Chieftains, a popular Celtic band originally from Dublin, Ireland. So Chicago was really hopping that night!Ah, alcohol and poetry and men in kilts. That should get us over the Hump of the Week!Escape Into Life is undergoing site maintenance.

The fabulous cover art is by Kathryn Renee.I have 2 poems in this issue, \"Doorknob\" and \"Biopsy,\" and by chance \"Biopsy\" just recently aired on WGLT Poetry Radio with music by Matt Flinner. You can hear a podcast of it here.And I had the thrill of reading with other women poets for Adanna Journal on Saturday night at AWP at an on-site reception, meeting Sandy Longhorn, Debra Bruce, and editor Christine Redman-Waldeyer, and hearing the work of many fine poets, present and not present (but graciously represented by Christine!).Keep an eye on Adanna's submission guidelines, as I think the next themed collection will be on how women grieve, already represented on the featured poets page here. And thanks to Wikipedia, as usual, for Amelia Earhart!Look for more AWP debriefing here on tomorrow's Fat Tuesday! And probably all week."},

And, of course, the stalls, preventing any actual peeing. Sigh....So I won't be blogging till after the event. Will be attending panels, readings, receptions, etc., and reading for Adanna Journal Saturday night. (See Events on the right.)

I was beginning to line up poetry features for March at Escape Into Life, and when I read these \"The day I fell in love with...\" poems by Gabriel, they seemed so perfect for Leap Day, a day when women can declare their love in \"unconventional\" ways, that I posted them on this special extra day of February.There's a golden ring hanging from the split rock above, so a marriage proposal hovers, too, and butterflies are circling in the poem.

Trouble, but under control, and no ambulance. Just not a good start to that particular day...The heart goes out in so many ways, to so many people, and I'm glad people can sometimes share their burdens, prayers, sympathies, wishes, woes, and joys by way of social media these days. Sometimes I get worn down by the political messages and self-promotional moments, and sometimes by the trivialities, but mostly I am glad to rejoice in good news and to be able to send good vibes to those who are suffering.And grateful for the great ideas and art & lit posted via link!I always love The Writer's Almanac, which today reminds us that it is the birthday of Michel de Montaigne, essentially the inventor of the essay--the essai or attempt to go forth in words, discursive-ly, as we say now, which can imply both rambling and reasoned discourse.As a blogger, I take to heart, and cringe a little at his advice, \"Don't discuss yourself, for you are bound to lose; if you belittle yourself, you are believed; if you praise yourself, you are disbelieved.\" Ack! I hope I don't belittle myself by embracing my own whimsy! And I hope I am not full of self-praise when I announce my own good news. A comfort is that other bloggers worry about this, too--The Scrapper Poet worries about the \"me, me, me\" slant even as she shares the good news we want to hear!--and so I hurry to her aid!It's good to remember that Montaigne himself acknowledged, \"I am myself the matter of my book\" and that he frequently uttered the gentle self-deprecation \"Que sais-je? (What do I know?)\" (as we learn in Wikipedia)! Surely it's a matter of striking a balance.Or perhaps a match. Hmm. Set the world on fire? Or go up in smoke? What, ultimately, will one's words do?"},

How about that shiny bronzing?!Anyhoo, it seemed perfect for Slattern Day in the blog, a day on which I will not be blogging much longer and, instead, defying Slattern Day with a heck of a lot of housecleaning.But what I really wanted you to see, and so I am sending you back, is the wonderful entry (scroll down past the \"bums\") on Pat Ingoldsby, Dublin poet, who sells his many books on the street. Goulding tells us that Ingoldsby used to be in children's television, and now he writes poetry. I admire his gumption and sense of humor. An Internet friend in Dublin alerted me to all this after buying one of Ingoldsby's books!

The sad news is hard, but it's real, and we must face it.

And a linocut of the cover art, Awake Before Dawn, by Nashay Antoinette Jones, aka \"Nyela,\" as she has signed it, that I can hold up as an example of \"reverse ekphrasis.\" She created the image based on an image in one of the poems! Usually ekphrasis goes the other way.Bad news: The Bloomington Post Office processing facility is scheduled to close by midsummer....  Sigh.How do you say ekphrasis? A recent newspaper article on another ekphrasis event this week told us to pronounce it ECK-fray-sis. But I usually hear it pronounced ek-FRAS- iss in the poetry community, partly because another word, possibly made up, \"ekphrastic,\" is pronounced ek-FRAS-tick. Like fantastic.If you try to say the long \"a\" in ECK-fray-sis, the accent on the first syllable sort of forces it back into the short \"a.\" The online dictionary audible pronunciation is more like EK-fruh-sis, the middle syllable being like the schwa \"upside-down e\" sound.Don't worry. If I attempt to address this issue in tonight's reading, I will just sing it.Anyhoo, many thanks to Hyacinth Girl Press, Margaret Bashaar (editor), Sarah Reck (internal layout), Hudson Rio (graphic design), and the beautiful Nyela, aka Nashay Antoinette Jones (cover artist), for their work on Nocturnes. I'll be getting the rest of my copies at the AWP Conference next week, and the press will ship book orders after that event, too.Tonight I look forward to hearing the poems of Jannett Highfill, guest poet, reading her art-related poems from Light Blessings Drifting Together, still forthcoming from Finishing Line Press.And the new \"ekphrastic\" work of Candace Armstrong and Janice Witherspoon Neuleib! They took the 6-week ekphrasis class at the MCAC and wrote a wonderful bunch of poems based on pastel drawings by John Cassidy, still up in the smaller gallery, where we will be reading, and black and white photographs by Rhondal McKinney and Jin Lee, recently up but just taken down from the large gallery.

Weyant's new chapbook, Wearing Heels in the Rust Belt, sometimes a dusty place, just posted at Escape Into Life, with art (there and here) by Casey Weldon.Here are two poems and a brief meditation on Ash Wednesday by Kristin Berkey-Abbott.Here are a couple of reviews (by women, one of them me) of chapbooks by women, To the Husband I Have Not Met Yet, by Mary Kathryn Jablonski, reviewed by Mary Ellen Geer, and Saint Monica, by Mary Biddinger (short review in right-hand column), over at Fiddler Crab Review. Wait!

So I am showing you luscious fruits by Jonathan Koch, as usual, plus the turnip we can eat tomorrow.It's been a busy couple of months, and this is a busy week, with two poetry events in it, both involving ekphrasis. Tonight, at Illinois Wesleyan University, in Westbrook Auditorium of Presser Hall, at 8:00 p.m., people can attend the New Music Cafe, for free (!), and hear new vocal music, as well as Mackinaw Ekphrasis, new music composed by David Vayo in response to photographs by Ken Kashian, with Mario J. Pelusi conducting.Earlier, several central Illinois poets responded to these central Illinois photographs with poems, and some of the poets will be reading those poems before the music is heard. I've heard a rehearsal of the music, and it's gorgeous! I hear water, I hear weather--thunder, lighting, the wind--and somehow maybe I hear corn growing! The poems and photographs can also be found in Kashian's book Along the Mackinaw River. You can also find the photos here, at Ken's photosharing website.Then Thursday (7:30 at the McLean County Arts Center) is the Ekphrasis Class poetry reading, with Candace Armstrong and Jan Neuleib reading new work, and guest poet Jannett Highfill reading art-related poems from her new book Light Blessings Drifting Together. I am reading two new poems based on the MCAC exhibits, and ekphrastic poems from Nocturnes, hot off the Hyacinth Girl press.We timed and rehearsed our part of the program today at the MCAC at our last official class meeting, and it was fun!

It was Ginny, one of my poetry students, with blueberry turnovers for my birthday! My mom called! And a jillion people are saying \"Happy Birthday!\" on Facebook. I love birthdays, even though it means I am getting older. I would like to think I am getting wiser, but I think a weird other osmosis thing is going on: I am taking it all in and being affected by it all. And even as my metaphorical skin gets thicker, it gets thinner, and there is very little barrier now.Another way of saying this, as I said to my mom on the phone, is, \"I guess I'm 55. But sometimes I feel like 5.\"\"Sometimes you act like 5.\" And there, in that nutshell (with an emphasis on nut), is our relationship, both of us laughing.Imaginary soundtrack: The White Album, specifically \"Birthday,\" by Paul McCartney and John Lennon.It's also Presidents Day, so take the day off! And the birthday of photographer Ansel Adams, whose pix I cannot show you, unless you click the official website, here, but this picture of him is in the public domain!Also, it's sort of the birthday of the United States Post Office, and I am pretty sure they are taking the day off, too! According to the Writer's Almanac, George Washington established the Post Office Department today in 1792. And John Glenn orbited the moon in 1962, when I actually was 5, not just 5 in my mind and on my red-high-topped feet. This may account for my enduring fascination with the moon and outer space. Or it's a random coincidence.And Margaret Bashaar of Hyacinth Girl Press says she is going to print my chapbook, Nocturnes, today, because it's my birthday. Yay. It has stars in it, the moon, black holes, and the large hadron collider. Songs at night, some about art, Whistler's nocturnes...Thanks to Nashay Antoinette Jones for this cover art and Hudson Rio for the graphic design. Thanks to Sarah Reck for the interior design and book layout. Thanks to Margaret Bashaar of Hyacinth Girl Press for loving the poems and making the book!I'll be reading a couple of these poems this week at the McLean County Arts Center, 7:30 p.m., along with ekphrasis class poetry students Candace Armstrong and Janice Witherspoon Neuleib, plus guest poet Jannett Highfill, who often includes art in her poems. I'd be happy to see any of you locals there!

Punches you in the heart.I love it when a film does its own thing well, letting the book stand alone and do its own thing well. I love the book To Kill a Mockingbird, which does one thing, and my favorite movie ever is To Kill a Mockingbird, which does its own thing, a little different, necessarily condensing the book. Compare/contrast is natural, but they each do it well, one on literary terms, the other on cinematic terms.Likewise with Le Herrison. The film works fine without a central narrative from a central character's past and without all the existentialism. I loved the philosophy in the book, but I did not miss it in the film. The film made me all the more curious about the Japanese film loved by Renee Michel; we see a clip. It made my experience of the book even richer without causing any problem at all for viewers (husband, friend) who had not read the book.Trailer here.I am such a slattern, I did not post yesterday, nor do anything but laundry and teaching today....  Oh, that is not even very slatternly...  Sigh, I'm such a lousy slattern."},

This was actually a fine and hilarious release! And I am grateful to Kim J. Kimmel for reminding me to blame the full moon for that building tension and unsettled feeling.Full moon tonight! (And here's a cool calendar about that.)If you, too, have been feeling unsettled of late, fictionalize your personal horror in 1500 words or less, and you could be anthologized at Smashwords. Learn more here at The Leaky Pencil about Eight Days of Madness, now expanded to 9. Many thanks to Seana, of Confessions of Ignorance, for this information.OK, so I do write down some dreams to know what the heck is going on in my subconscious and because writers have been known to get great poems, prose poems, and even fiction from dreams. The heckler in my dreams was an annoying man who had accepted an invitation to a poetry \"party\" at which I was the guest (paid) workshop leader. He sat at the end of the table--it's OK; I'd already chosen the middle, a more cooperative/collaborative position--and casually dismissed the whole idea of workshops and especially any poem with the word \"armpit\" in it.I was quiet and gracious in my insistence that no workshop would proceed while this heckling was going on. They had a choice, the other participants, to let this just be a party or to stop the heckling and I'd proceed. As in so many cases, no one spoke up except me. I spoke up!The dream ended before this was resolved but not before I acquired a superpower. At one point, and I admit that this was less than gracious, with my left hand (which knew what it was doing), I flicked the heckler against the wall. He slid down horizontal on the floor, dazed and silent.Part of me liked this quite a bit. The other part me revised the dream to take up where it had left off just before the superpower flicking and resumed its standing up to evil with words and without violence.My husband also revises his violent dreams into non-violent dreams. We are lucid that way.I would just like to say that in my Ekphrasis class today--in real, waking life--the students very graciously received my poem based on a photograph by Eudora Welty.

I own my opinions (and am annoyed by anonymous commenters all over the Internet, who don't) and place my values and concerns firmly in the context of whatever I am discussing. Often I see the complexities in a topic, not just the black and white.Today I am seeing pink. On Facebook, for now, the arrow points at me. (Once I get Timeline, I don't know where the heck it will be pointing.) Here, it is pointing out at all the others who are standing with Planned Parenthood in the current controversy involving the Susan G. Komen for Cure foundation. Here's a summary article on the current state of affairs from the New York Times.I am distressed by the polarization in our country right now. This is a great example of it. And of the \"black and white\" stance taken by so many, who, in this case, seem to have reduced it all to an abortion debate, at the same time reducing Planned Parenthood to an abortion clinic. I have to confess I lived many, many years not even knowing that abortions were one of the services provided by Planned Parenthood. I have always considered it a place I could go for information and education about contraception, family planning, sexual and reproductive health, and STDs, as needed. That I could go there, that teens could get information there (if unable to get it from parents or school), and that people of all income levels could go there. In Chicago, the nearest Planned Parenthood office to me was around the corner from a religious bookstore. They co-existed peacefully in my neighborhood.Here is the handy pie-chart on the services Planned Parenthood provides. Here is their website for more info.I have participated in Race for the Cure (walking) and worn pink shirts at numerous volleyball games via Volley for the Cure. I have lost friends and relatives to breast cancer, and have friends and relatives who are healthy survivors. I am grateful for all that has and can be done by Komen and other organizations to raise awareness and help fund research for treatment and cure. Like Barbara Ehrenreich, I don't think that wearing a pink ribbon and relentlessly smiling will be enough, and I will watch what happens next and think long and hard about how I will support breast cancer research in the future.I imagine I'll keep buying and using those Fund the Fight, Find a Cure stamps at the post office.

Not so much because of what happened to them, but because of what happened to the others! Until they run around and smell each other, they no longer recognize any other sheep. I can't help but make a human connection, of a spiritual or emotional or psychological sort. When we are naked and vulnerable together, shorn of our protective covering, yes, we don't know who we are! But this is us! The real us, the old us, and the new us. And we are finally focused on each other! By necessity! To know who we are collectively, to figure ourselves out individually.And running around smelling each other somehow seems perfect for the Hump of the Week in the blog.You can read some of Sherry O'Keefe's poems here, and her blog, here. I think her Making Good Use of August chapbook must be sold out at Finishing Line Press, as the link doesn't work, so contact her through her blog, if you want to get hold of that.The fabulous art here, at the interview, and in Sherry O'Keefe's solo poetry feature is by Escape Into Life artist Michal Geidrojc."},

Her poem, \"Tact,\" by Margaret Kirk, is on page 103. It was inspired by an incident in the McLean Museum of History, but it is the kind of thing any of us might have witnessed somewhere or had to handle ourselves, which, as my mom puts it, takes \"stoic kindness.\"She is my poetry \"student\" now, but I first learned about poetry from her, not to mention everything I know about stoic kindness. Thanks, Mom! And congratulations!An extra delight is that a poem by Patricia McMillen, \"Running Wild,\" is a couple pages away, and there's this poetry friend from Chicago running wild as a child (and a horse) in her front yard and in her imagination, becoming \"a whole herd.\"Further on, the poignant \"Too Late,\" by Barry Silesky, a poetry friend and mentor. I learned about prose poetry from Barry. Favorites Michael Hettich and Lee Rossi are in there. Oh, and many more. I've only had the issue a few hours!

{"title": "Going to Heaven", "date": "Sunday, January 29, 2012", "text": "Today I was smacked in the head and chest by Emily Dickinson's poem on The Writer's Almanac, titled there as \"Going to Heaven.\" Don't ever think she's sappy. She isn't. Wait till you get to stanza three.Likewise, smacked by a quotation from Anton Chekhov, who had been praised in a letter that also challenged him to take his writing more seriously. \"Your letter struck me like lightning. I became very emotional upon opening it. I nearly cried. I understand now that if I have a gift, I should honor it, which I have not always done in the past.\" I nearly cried, too, on reading this! Again, not sappy. Serious! Takes courage to do that. And, the Almanac reports, as he became more monetarily successful as a writer, he kept up his doctoring, providing free medical care to the poor. I like that guy.To make it a Random Coinciday as well as a Poetry Someday in the blog, I was just discussing an excellent production of Three Sisters with an actor last night, in the green room of a Gala event for the McLean County Chamber of Commerce. Yes, a glorious combination of business people and creative people; sometimes the twain shall meet! (And, no doubt, great businesses have plenty of creativity; and great artists, even those without good business sense, figure out how to get the job done!)RE: Gala. Actors recreated business people from McLean County's past for the business people of McLean County's present, who were receiving the annual Chamber of Commerce Awards. Ruth Steele, who appeared in the wonderful Mitsubishi commercial that made Normal, Illinois famous, was there to speak, and great fun was had by all. I was glad to be a part of it and to join the business community for cordials in the after party.RE: Three Sisters. A marvelous collaboration of the MFA program at Illinois State University and Heartland Theatre, where the play was performed, directed by Sandi Zielinski. The production itself was both moving and funny, as Chekhov should be, but I was also powerfully moved between acts, as the actors, in character, rolled up rugs and moved furniture to change the scenes. It was part of the change of household going on in the play. Terrific!Yesterday, I left the house at 11:15 a.m. and returned at 11:15 p.m.--yep, actors work hard. So it was not a Slattern Day. Hence, today is not a church day but a work day: all the laundry, all the dishes, a chicken soup to prepare, plus two poetry class preps. Does this mean I am not going to heaven? (Or that I am!)"},

{"title": "Offer Your Art Up to the Whole World", "date": "Thursday, January 26, 2012", "text": "As if to contribute to yesterday's discussion on asking the most basic questions about art, Lucinda Williams says this, \"Above all, the listener should be able to understand the poem or the song, not be forced to unravel a complicated, self-indulgent puzzle. Offer your art up to the whole world, not just an elite few.\" It's her birthday, that fact and this quotation thanks to The Writer's Almanac. Thanks to Wikipedia and Creative Commons for Lucinda with her guitar.Of course, Lucinda's music and lyrics are right out there, raw and repetitive (in the way refrains are, so we can sing along and really feel it), her heart offered up to the world. Her dad is the poet Miller Williams, and I got to hear them together in a program of the Poetry Center at the Art Institute of Chicago once! Great evening.But her country-music out-thereness is not for everybody. And I don't mind unraveling...a braid, or putting together a puzzle, if I see that the unraveling frees the wild mane or the jigsaw diligence reveals the whole with my participation, and if there is something of interest available right away. So it is still a matter of balance. We can be available and accessible as artists and still offer a reasonable challenge.If we are seeing something new, that's what we want to show, yes? If we are feeling something intensely that we sense is probably a shared feeling, we want to communicate our experience, not just express a feeling (the self-indulgence Lucinda warns against).Oh, I know that English departments have broken off from Communications departments on just this issue, with Communications identified with delivering information for some specific purpose (advertising or public relations, journalism or broadcast journalism, etc.). But what I mean is that when I read or write a poem, I am hoping to commune with someone in some way!Uh, and it's not \"an elite few,\" really, I hope, but it is an intimate communion with each member of the community I find there. Let us share this moment together, whoever we are, via the tangible poem or song and the intangible experience created by it."},
{"title": "Cold Enough to Cry", "date": "Wednesday, January 25, 2012", "text": "It's not that cold here today, but it could be, and has been. No, I am quoting from the poem \"Snow, the Lane Home,\" by Angie Macri, up now in her feature at Escape Into Life. Don't worry, you won't stay cold. The seasons change in her poems, and in the photos by Mahbubur Rahman, which also offer a different geography and terrain, other waters.The sky is a diffuse cloudy blue-gray here today, and the tall wheat-colored prairie grasses in the ditches are coated with frost. But it's above freezing, and tomorrow it'll go into the 40s, and I may take a long walk into town to the post office to mail a letter to Switzerland. I give myself reasons.Today I'm still thinking about that desire in us, as writers or as visual artists, to let the work speak for itself. We don't want to have to explain or interpret. But in what ways can we help listeners at a reading, or viewers at an opening or \"art talk,\" perceive the offered works? What little bit of context will ready the hearer for the poem? Or what interesting question can get a viewer looking more closely at a painting or photograph, or seeing something s/he didn't see before?Is your first impression here of one tree, or of two? Is this a new tree growing from the roots of the old, dead tree? Or is this a young, vibrant tree that sucked up what the old tree needed, killing it? What is it about the rest of the photograph that provides evidence to support you in either impression? Or a third impression?These are the kinds of simple, natural questions that I like to ask about what I am seeing. It doesn't bother me if someone thinks I am simple, as I know myself to have a side-by-side sophisticated awareness of various things, or the ability to research what I don't know, etc. It doesn't bother me if the photographer turns out to be more interested in how he manipulated light or color, or if the painter is more interested in texture and composition. When I write a poem, I, too, am aware of some formal things going on that are essentially invisible to many readers. As they should be!But truly, if I look at two trunks in the foreground, I am going to ask the simplest questions about what I am seeing, and wonder why the artist pursued that particular subject matter. My simple questions will cause me to pay attention, look closely, and start to see new things.I see here a road somewhat traveled. I imagine I will keep walking and won't sit down on that bench."},

Got to hear a double art talk by the last two, so more abundance.I find a particular pleasure in the pairing of Lee and McKinney as all the photographs are bisected horizontally by the horizon, making me stand there and contemplate it in peace, as I do in life.And another particular delight in looking at wild color and motion muted by soft pastel in the work of Cassidy. It all makes me meditate on the interplay of motive, technique, and effect in visual art as compared to literary art!Not to mention the particular irony of an \"art talk\" by people who would prefer not to talk about their art and/or who wish, as Jin Lee put it, \"to circumvent language.\" So now, I will simply contemplate cabbages.

{"title": "Tangled Nets", "date": "Sunday, January 22, 2012", "text": "This morning I had just been looking at a poem I've been revising for months (OK, years), printing it out to get some feedback on it later this week. It has the ocean in it, \"a slipper silver as a fish,\" and a fishing net.So what's the reflection about when I get to church? Fishing nets. All right, dropping them to follow the big guy. But enough to make it a Random Coinciday!Pastor Bob was interested in what would make you drop everything and start a new adventure, and, specifically, what would you need to give up to do so.This was not leading to an easy equation, nor a conventional platitude: to win big you have to take a big risk, etc. This was a suggestion that we might have to give up a sense of identity. When Simon and Andrew left off fishing, they were leaving a way of life. When James and John stopped mending their nets, they were leaving a family business:We can safely suppose there were sacrifices involved--psychological ones as well as material, having to leave behind not only their livelihood but something of their self-understanding, too.If I've thought of myself one way, how do I think of myself a different way in order to grow or try something new? And it might not be the positives I am leaving behind but the negatives. As Bob put it:But we don't pay as much attention to ideas and attitudes that keep us from more creative and satisfying possibilities.  For instance, what about self doubt?  What about resentments and grudges?  What about taking responsibility for problems that belong to others?   What about the need to please someone who'll never give their approval?  What if some of our mental baggage amounted to the fishing nets those first disciples walked away from to promote a more optimistic and worthwhile agenda for our neighbors and family and friends?Yes, the nets could well be seen as entanglements, or things we hold onto that can drag us down into the swirling depths, or even drown us. It's hard to swim tangled in a net or lugging a lot of mental baggage.So this is something I'll be thinking about for a while and hoping to implement. I realized I could report in church today that I had been a good goatherd this week! A guy who could have gotten my goat didn't. I let him talk and let it go. I suppose it could be said that I did not take any responsibility for his problem! He gets to do that! (Poor him.)Meanwhile, I had some poem acceptances this week, including a poem called \"Grudge.\" I'm not sure what to make of that."},

Between sets and matches, I was reading an interview in The Sun--oh, how I love The Sun! thank you, Kim J Kimmel for that gift subscription!--with Ina May Gaskin, author of Birth Matters and the book that rocked my pregnant world, Spiritual Midwifery.This makes it a Random Coinciday in the blog, as well, since my recent finalist chapbook manuscript (over at Comstock Review) is also titled Spiritual Midwifery, in honor of that book, and contains a poem titled \"Spiritual Midwifery\" about a sad childbirth (that also stands for several losses in lives close to mine) that prepared me to accept what might go wrong at my own labor and also served as the contrast deepening my joy at my own wonderful luck.I seldom read this poem aloud at public readings, but whenever I do, it releases something in someone who lets me know. And thanks me. So I am moved, grateful, and reluctant to read it in public again, lest someone be unprepared to revisit a sad moment, but I shouldn't be, right? They are glad to know someone realizes, and cares. Dilemma.The interview in The Sun is powerful, reminding us that the mortality rate for mothers is rising in the USA, where many do not have access to midwives and doulas, and is very low in countries that do. I was surprised to learn that 100% of women in Germany have access a midwife because \"there's a law that a midwife must be present.\" Here, doctors are no longer even instructed on how to handle a vaginal breech birth and routinely do a caesarian. Etc.Part of what surprised me was the lessening of awareness that natural childbirth, aided by midwives or doulas, is a wonderful way to have a baby. My son is 21 years old, and somehow I thought we'd have progressed in this...return to the older, natural, woman-centered ways...but no. Gaskin points out three main ways to have a baby in America: planned home birth with a professional midwife, hospital setting with a certified nurse-midwife (and doctor handy if needed), and hospital setting with a doctor and nurses.I had both my babies with certified nurse midwives in a hospital, no pain meds, which was right for me, and all was well. If my daughter chooses and is able to have a baby, she will probably need to be in a hospital setting, as well, and I am glad of our medical knowledge today, and glad of the midwives who understand that love, encouragement, and support are crucial.Also on my wishlist is Home/Birth: a poemic, by Arielle Greenberg and Rachel Zucker. Maybe I'll have read it by the time I can hand it down to my daughter!The Sun's cover photo is by Corey Hendrickson."},

And to join Wikipedia, the people's encyclopedia, in solidarity!Since my first job was an as encyclopedia editor and staff writer, back in the days of print, I am also aware of the complexities of a people-written information source, believe you me! I know the Facts-On-File fact-checking we did as a staff to keep information accurate, objective, and up-to-date, and we hired experts in the field to write the appropriate in-depth articles. And as a college teacher, I required students to use regular and scholarly sources like journals and databases, where the information is reviewed and double-checked, and also to \"know your source\" or the slant of the particular journal or writer, as needed. Etc.! But I do love Wikipedia as a quick, fun, and easy place to get an overview, crucial details, and links to other sources, a starting place to see what you're going to have to find out and confirm.

Hmm, how would you let me know? I ask because my friend Kim J. Kimmel is having such trouble, and I don't know 1) the reason or 2) how to solve it. I see that the new \"Reply\" function creates a text box that requires you to scroll down to find the place to type in the verification word if you want to comment, and I had to click around a bit to figure out how to comment on someone else's blog, so I suggest 1) patience and 2) clicking around until Blogger figures out...a fix."},

I was not a winner of the Jessie Bryce Niles Chapbook Contest, but I was a Special Merit finalist (back to being a bridesmaid for me!), and have 2 poems forthcoming in anniversary issues of the Comstock Review.I can't help but be glad for the winner, Lucinda Grey, and look forward to receiving her winning chapbook The Blue Hills: Poems After the Life of Maud Gonne, which sounds intriguing, Yeatsian, historical, and actressy, all coincidences of the sort I like. I do appreciate it when contest entrants receive the winning book.And how wonderful that Jonathan Koch is now offering some of his gorgeous art on notecards! See them and get them in his Store!"},
{"title": "You Say Libero, I Say Libero", "date": "Sunday, January 15, 2012", "text": "In volleyball news, the teen club season has begun, and I got to see my daughter play again yesterday. She is the libero, a back row player who can come in for two other players without a special moment at the line with the referee to handle the substitution. It makes for swifter play.At high levels of competition, there is a \"libero tracker\" to make sure these entrances and exits are all in order. The position of libero started in international play, and went to the clubs and colleges before it went to the schools, filtering down from high schools to junior high, but soon it will be pretty standard.It is pronounced LEE-burr-o, evidently from the Romance languages and related to being a \"free\" substitution player. Around here, people say Luh-BEAR-o, as nobody knew how to pronounce it when it first arrived. So, either is correct, but, given the accents, you can't really sing it to \"Let's Call the Whole Thing Off,\" by George and Ira Gershwin, from Shall We Dance. \"You say potato, I say potato...You like tomatoes, I like tomatoes...\"My daughter is playing in Peoria today (theatre joke), where my husband was coaching a younger club team yesterday. He's there with her, to watch, and then has to turn around and come back to coach his team at the local club. This extra driving could have been avoided if I were not part of the 50%. Yes, really, as a team (marriage, family, American citizenry), we are part of the 99%, not the rich 1%, but in the scheme of things, I am part of the vast majority of women whose husbands only listen to 50% of what they say. As in, \"Do you have to go to Peoria tomorrow? Because, if not, she can get a ride with a teammate. She has to be there at 9:00 a.m.\"\"I have to be there at 11:00.\"\"Do you want to take her and see her play before you have to start coaching?\"\"Yes, I can do that.\" Etc.Suddenly, this morning, my husband realized he had to drive to Peoria.Shall we dance?"},

The temperature went up to 12 degrees.I was plenty bundled up for the job, as I kept my jammies on under my jeans, wore two scarves around my neck, hat and gloves, the thick, non-slippery gloves good for driving and shoveling, and only the tips of my fingers felt cold.

It was a late-start morning at school, so when I drove my daughter to school the recently-full moon was in a different place in the sky, higher, a faint globe of white hanging in the blue among white clouds. I thought I was done with the goatcheese moon, but I'm not. I'll never be done with the moon.I don't know how to credit these marvelous moon-shots that have been going around Facebook. If you know who took these photos, please credit the photographer in the comments! I am charmed by them.And Ren Powell posted a link to this great article on stress in Wired. It's fascinating, explains so much, and rings so true. I agree that stress damages and kills us, and I'm glad that scientists are paying attention to that.I'd say my concern (beyond all the bad human and bad baboon behavior) is that the scientists see the \"cure\" as a vaccine, and see that as getting to the source, while I see that as still addressing the symptoms by attempting to prevent them in advance, with a drug.I'd like to see us pay attention to the root causes of stress, and attempt to solve those in global & societal ways, in a shift of attitudes, and/or using a combination of natural and organic ways...but that's complicated and takes hard, patient, diligent, cooperative work.  A vaccine is easier.Oh, you'll see. The article has all kinds of social, economic, and political pertinence, as well as the science and health aspects, and is funny and a smooth read. Long, but if you are patient and stick with it, you will learn a lot and win the Be a Better Baboon Award.***Update, with info from Susan Elbe!  Thank you, Susan.  The moon photos are by Laurent Laveder, and you can see more and get some at his website, here!"},

{"title": "Big Fat Moon, Married Love, and a Goatherd", "date": "Monday, January 9, 2012", "text": "OK, it took all my concentration this morning to be a safe driver, once I'd seen that big fat full moon hovering on the horizon. I pointed it out, over my left shoulder, to my daughter, as we turned right, or east, toward her school, and then I chose the route home that would let me drive safely west, straight at it, watching it elongate (become more oblong than round), drop, and disappear. This happened rather quickly, on a stretch of rough road that takes me by the home of Chris Al-Aswad (founding editor of Escape Into Life), as part of the moon's appearance in the morning at this time of year, I hear, is illusory. It's there and not there, visible through refraction? That is, illusory at the moment of sun coming up on one horizon and moon going down on the other horizon. Tonight, look up! Tomorrow morning, arrange the routine to see as much of that moon as I can!I also realized this morning that I'd come round in the Poetry Radio rotation again last night. Alas, I missed the cool 20-years-of-Acousticity show, with Allison Krauss as a teenager!  You can hear the poem if you want, \"Married Love,\" as a podcast, or read it in the Love Poems issue of Poetry East, #53, which you can find here. It's also in my chapbook Broken Sonnets, as it is a \"broken\" (and unrhyming) sonnet about an \"unbroken\" (sometimes, OK, often rhyming) marriage.And I am my own goatherd, I hope, thanks to this fine reflection by Bob Ryder, in the Reflecting Pool. Bob was reminding us at church yesterday of the vigilance it takes to remain nonviolent in life, down to not letting someone \"get our goat\"--that is, not letting someone provoke us into being cranky and irritable in our own actions and speech. Bob told about a job interview, and a boss's warning about a certain manager:“This guy seems to know how to get a person's goat,” he explained. “No worries.” I countered, “I’ll leave my goat at home.” Heh heh. Bob then confessed to his own failure to leave his goat at home, and I have been known to be cranky and irritable in response to the bad behavior of others or to actual or perceived insult, offense, or injustice, so this was a good goat's heads-up for me. (Also, I had been craving drunken goat cheese on the walk to church, but that's another story, and a great excuse for the drunken goat cheese illustration again!) While I did not speak into the microphone at church about it, I had a little epiphany! I had just run into a guy who not only gets my goat but resembles a goat! And I was gentle with him, said happy new year, and wished him well. I wasn't letting him off the hook, er, the shepherd's hook(!), but I was letting him be his own goatherd, as I'm not interested in that job.Thanks, once again, to Jonathan Koch for the watermelon, which is neither goat nor moon."},
{"title": "Heaven and Hell", "date": "Sunday, January 8, 2012", "text": "Well, it's Sunday, so today's long walk will be to church and back, where I may or may not ponder Heaven and Hell. (We reflect on a wide variety of things at my particular church but seldom that.)But I invite you to ponder Heaven and Hell via these poems, compiled by poet and poetry editor John Guzlowski, in the new issue of The Scream Online. John asked me (at Facebook!) to help spread the word, so I hope it's OK to do this way, including the photo by Richard Beban, also a poet!First up in this issue is Kirstin Berkey-Abbott's wonderful poem \"Heaven on Earth,\" which begins, \"I saw Jesus at the bowling alley, / slinging nothing but gutter balls.\" There's a link to Garrison Keillor reading the poem for The Writer's Almanac, and Beban's photo on that page includes chocolate, or, as it reads in French, chocolat! Now you're tempted, yes?!This afternoon, my poetry workshop starts up again, with red wine and new assignments. I was tickled by the coincidence that Richard Beban and his wife Kaaren Kitchell also teach workshops in their home! Kitchell is also represented in Heaven and Hell, with the stunning poem \"Blue Town\" and the glorious gift of \"Gift.\"Later this month, I start teaching a couple of classes in ekphrasis, or poetry in response to painting, at the McLean County Arts Center. Yes, the new year begins! Heaven on earth, in bowling alley or art gallery, living  room or kitchen, church or hiking trail.

{"title": "On the Trail", "date": "Saturday, January 7, 2012", "text": "I've been on the trail lately, our local hiking/biking Constitution Trail, one of those rails-to-trails renovations, thanks to the wonderfully warm weather. Yesterday I bumped (not literally) into a poet friend on his bicycle, teaching his \"new knees\" (post-surgery) how to bend and getting some of the fresh winter air. Conversing, we right away went deep, as he noted; it's what we always do: get to the heart of things. We are poet friends.The day before that, a total stranger, out for a run, cared for me, my random life. We were crossing the street together, where the trail crosses the road, in opposite directions. We had waited for one car, and another was just then turning left out of the school parking lot. She'd had time to see us and was driving slowly, and had paused, but I think he noticed how she was now blinded by the sun, and he made eye contact with me and said, softly, \"Watch out,\" not to frighten but just to alert me in case she lost me in the sun. We all survived.This small spontaneous kindness fills me with all kinds of wonder. Of course, this is what we should be doing for one another in the world, caring for and protecting one another, but so often we don't. People go on in their routines, neglecting one another or not paying sufficient attention, and wham! or alas! or dwindle...sigh...Anyway, my heart was warmed, and so was my body, by the winter sun.Somehow this connects to Once, by Meghan O'Rourke, a book I reviewed for Rattle here. I was reading it before Christmas, not knowing that the poet's mother would die on Christmas Day in these poems. There was plenty I did not know about O'Rourke, and, I guess, was glad not to know, and only learned today, reading this other review, by Greg Weiss, also in Rattle, of Halflife, a book I got hold of, used, after reading Once. (I look forward to reading it but will wait till the perfect, random time!)And, by chance, I had a lunch meeting with a poet friend over the holidays who had just finished reading The Long Goodbye, O'Rourke's memoir about her mother. She found it sentimental. I did not find the poems sentimental, just straightforward and fairly spare. I must ponder what is meant by \"sentimental\" each time that comes up about someone's writing, including my own. (And I have to answer a question about avoiding sentimentality in love poems for an interview pretty soon!) I consider myself tenderhearted but not very sentimental. I have too much irony in me for that. But that doesn't stop anyone from accusing me of it! Which I say laughing, because, among the things one might be accused of in life, sentimentality is harmless and not illegal.Anyhoo, like Greg Weiss, I didn't know anything about Meghan O'Rouke before I read Once, except that she'd written these other books and had a professional career. I find myself cringing a bit at the \"gossip\" that Weiss notes has attached to her, and I continue to feel the same compassion I felt before, now adding some for the suffering that goes with being gossiped about. I wish her a full and gentle healing as she continues the lifelong grieving for her mother, and I am glad she has writing as an outlet for this grief. All the rest is her own business, and no doubt she's attending to it. If I were a runner on the trail, and saw a car too near, the driver blinded by the sun, I'd make eye contact with her and say softly, \"Watch out.\""},
{"title": "In the Pink", "date": "Friday, January 6, 2012", "text": "If I say I am starting the new year off \"in the pink,\" I mean it more literally than an expression enclosed by quotation marks might suggest. And, while I am enormously healthy, I probably don't mean \"in the pink\" as in perfect physical condition, though I do start my Stretch & Tone class again soon, as I can't swim laps outdoors now and walks will become less frequent as winter progresses, though I took one on the trail yesterday and will walk into town today.* This gentle fitness class is a gift from my mom, and she'll be in it, too! Thanks, Mom!By \"in the pink,\" I mean I have been surrounded by pink at dusk and dawn the past few days, glorious pink. Last night the pink surrendered completely to blue fairly quickly, but the night before it was like living in a world of pink for some time, yes, a sustainable pink. This morning, on the brink of post-holiday nostalgic despair while driving my daughter back to school, I was a Jonah inside a pale blue whale with ribs of pink.Sometimes when I use a particular expression, I remember asking my mom, \"What does that mean?\" Those wonderful moments of childhood confusion and delight return. I remember asking my mom, \"What are whores  devores?' and her asking to see the exact place in the book I was reading. Yes, they were hors d'oeuvres, and if I could graze on a steady diet of not-too-rich hors d'oeuvres, I probably would. Hoping they'd keep me in the pink.These days I can Google a phrase, to learn more about its meaning and origins, as I did with \"in the pink,\" finding this delightful article on its history and this fashion website. I am unlikely either to shop in the pink or to hunt foxes (also, we learn, an unlikely origin of the phrase, as the fox hunting jackets were scarlet and the tailor Thomas Pink might not have existed), but I am very likely to see pinks in my garden again come spring and was delighted to learn (or re-learn) that the name Pinks relates perhaps to color, perhaps to the \"pinked\" (as in pinking shears) edges, and to the Dutch name for these pink Dianthus flowers, \"'pink-ooghen'--'little eye' (literally--to blink).\" (And I am glad the flower connection is \"to blink\" and not pink-eye, or conjunctivitis.)The other place I go regularly to learn about word origins is the Con-fessions of Ignorance blog, where a fine discussion of trifles is ongoing! Yes, this is the same excellent person who once thought I had called her a Versatile Slattern!*And I was urged out of doors yesterday not only by the fine winter weather (40s, 50s, and today maybe even a high of 60!) but also by the blog & walks of poet Carol Berg, who has lovely poems up in the new issue of IthacaLit, which, she says, she found thanks to me!

{"title": "Crab Creek, Sugar Creek, and Spoon River", "date": "Wednesday, January 4, 2012", "text": "When the mail did arrive yesterday, in answer to my question, “Where’s the mail?”, it brought the new issue of Crab Creek Review, where, in a wonderful random coincidence, I found myself back-to-back with Marie Gauthier, the lovely poet I also mentioned yesterday as having just been reviewed at Fiddler Crab, home of the poetry chapbook review! Marie’s poem “Dispatch from the Sick-House” is on page 17, and my poem “Waking Up Fragile” is on page 18 of the winter issue of Crab Creek, with its marvelous magical rowboat cover! I hope it is all right to reproduce it here, sending you to more of Lucia Neare’sTheatrical Wonders here!This particular photo reminds me of a performance of A Midsummer Night’s Dream in the woods of Saginaw, Michigan, many years ago.  I was Titania (and Hippolyta) and was rowed across to a clearing for one of the scenes. Of course, I was not the one wearing the ass head. Then yesterday I was gazing into the cold but rippling water of Sugar Creek, snow and ice on its banks, as we stacked a tower of freshwater mussel shells for a new ad to go with a new logo for Spoon River Poetry Review, now edited by Kirstin Hotelling Zona, who wants to make a clear distinction between the review, named for the actual Spoon River, and Spoon River Anthology, by Edgar Lee Masters, a completely different poetic endeavor.Spoon River, as Zona explains in her introduction to issue 36.1, the winter/spring 2011 issue of SRPR, “was itself purportedly named for the palm-sized freshwater mussels to which it was home, bivalves whose shells, so the story has it, were used by the region’s Native Americans in preparing and serving food.” Yes, as spoons.So that’s what we were doing: stacking shells like pancakes in a heap, or pearly inside up as spoons, and strewing them on the crackly ice and snow in that “certain slant of light” (not at all oppressive) of a winter afternoon.Here’s how this came about: in “Amelie” fashion, when Kirstin asked if any of us Sugar Creek and Spoon River poet naturalists might have some photos of stacked mussels, or a set of mussels to stack, I recommended Dennis Campbell, a biology professor, whose class I’d once accompanied down to the banks of Sugar Creek to find and sort mussel shells.*Soon after that field day, I wrote a wacky poem incorporating the wacky names of freshwater mussel species in Illinois. Look for it to appear in a forthcoming issue of SRPR! I connected Kirstin and Dennis by email, because, hey, that’s what I do, and sure enough he drove up from Springfield, stopping in Lincoln, to pick up mussel shells from his Lincoln College lab, and we spent a lovely afternoon under the blue sky, looking at water, and taking pictures of shells.  Look for them in a forthcoming ad for SRPR.*Dennis and his class also found the world’s largest woolly mammoth on another field day that spring!  Look for it (in pieces) in the Illinois State Museum and the soon-to-open Environmental Center at Lincoln College! Both tusks were found (and I got to stick my arm up one), a partial jaw, and other pieces, and perhaps there will be more (mammoth) to come!So, from Crab Creek to Sugar Creek and Spoon River, from freshwater mussels to woolly mammoths, all in one blog entry. That should get us through the hump of the week!For me, it’s back to the “exquisite dark beauty” of Crab Creek Review, as editors Kelli Russell Agodon & Annette Spaulding-Convy call it in their Editors’ Note. Exquisite, indeed."},

{"title": "Lo, How a Rose", "date": "Saturday, December 24, 2011", "text": "While it is true that I kept a poinsettia alive all year only to kill it at Christmastime, I do have a tiny rose just now opening in a pot here on Christmas Eve. The Exotic Angels are doing a blooming dance of joy, as well, and there's new burst of blue lobelia. The pale pink begonias in the once-hanging pots just keep opening, all of these in a row on woven straw mats in the sunshine of the patio doors, taking the spot once reserved for shoes and boots, which are grudgingly clumped here and there on rugs and in corners. Oh, forgive me, shoes and boots and the feet who wear them!I baked my tropical husband a coconut cake for Christmas, soon to be iced with Joy of Cooking boiled icing (unless I kill it) and sprinkled with the remaining coconut. This 7-Minute frosting at Food Network is essentially it, and I will take Alton Brown's advice to beat the frosting over the simmering water, and to use the frosting itself (instead of strawberry or raspberry preserves) between layers. Also, my cake has two layers instead of four. Why am I baking a cake from scratch and making boiled icing on a Slattern Day? Because it's Christmas Eve! (But I did not smash an actual coconut, so I think I can still claim to be a true slattern. Also, you should see the thin layer of flour on my kitchen floor.)Happy and sweet holidays to you. Peace and goodwill."},

Well, now I am one! Officially. I'm it! Over at Prick of the Spindle, in the newly redesigned site just up today with the new issue!This means that even though I could never really do the tiger jump, I can be a cheerleader!The Poetry Cheerleader is my new poetry-review column! First up is The Unemployed Man Who Became a Tree, by Kevin Pilkington. I also have a couple reviews in the regular review section: Ghost, by Gaylord Brewer, and Four of a Kind, by Mark Neely.Plus, you can read a bunch of other reviews, poems, stories, interviews, essays, and even drama, as you can see from this table of contents page! I do like the new design at Prick of the Spindle! Very easy even for somebody as click-challenged as I am. So, congratulations to editor Cynthia Reeser on all her hard work!Now I want to tell you about a random coincidence (which, yes, is redundant, right?) involving epigraphs. Killing the Murnion Dogs, by Joe Wilkins, reviewed over in the Escape Into Life blog, begins with this quotation from Bruce Springsteen:Everything dies, baby, that's a fact.But maybe everything that dies someday comes back.The Unemployed Man Who Became a Tree, by Kevin Pilkington, begins with 3 epigraphs, one of which is this, by Ben Jonson:Time will not be ours forever;He at length our good will sever.Spend not then his gifts in vain,Suns that set may rise again.This kind of thing makes sparks fly out of my poetry cheer-leader origami brain. Thanks to Phillip Compton (EIL store artist) for the spider mums that resemble cheerleader pom pons.

These are the cookie bars I gave to my husband early in our courtship, which, evidently, made him think I could cook. (I can't, except accidentally.) The theory is that the rolled oats will roll away the sweetened condensed milk, chocolate, and cholesterol. No worries.And there's a nice picture of the sun and moon on the same horizon, a thing that happened during that recent eclipse, over at Escape Into Life, in the blog, where I have posted a mini-review of Killing the Murnion Dogs, by Joe Wilkins, decorated with art by Phillip Compton.

A different car. First was a gray wagon; second, a white mini-van. So people are out there driving around with reindeer antlers.I am glad I am staying home now, baking more pumpkin bread. Of course, yesterday I was out there as the Christmas Bunny, delivering red velvet mini-cupcakes in an egg carton. But I did not put bunny ears on my car.OK, this bug is cute."},

It provoked quite a discussion, I hear, not exactly in response to the questions at the end or the continuing theme of \"Fear not.\"My mom and I missed church for that train trip to Chicago to hear readings from Solace in So Many Words at Woman Made Gallery. So we were reflecting on important things, but we were not discussing Mary's virginity (or lack thereof) or the virtues of fine storytelling as part of most religions.Actually, I was discussing religion and mythology in my Solace essay, so I guess this is a Random Coinciday in the blog, too.To that end, I would just like to say that it was not quite coincidence that I picked this art for Mary's poems. That is, I chose this coincidence of hairstyle. See the straight-across bangs on the girl in this collage? Just like Mary Biddinger's! Although that's a bit hidden under her green winter hat in the EIL bio photo. Just like \"hidden\" meanings in poems (or lack thereof).Hail, Mary, full of grace."},
{"title": "Comfort Food for Thought", "date": "Tuesday, December 13, 2011", "text": "It’s Fat Tuesday in the blog, so I should perhaps discuss the upcoming pumpkin bread blitz, the weird cupcake extravaganza (exploding in my origami brain), or the Rolo turtles (Rolo melted on a mini-pretzel, topped with a pecan) that I hope not to burn, my excellent mashed potatoes (secret ingredients: potatoes, butter, cream) (always my Christmas dinner contribution, along with the pumpkin bread), but, after this fat sentence is over, I intend to mention two statements that were, for me, a kind of “comfort food for thought” involving poetry.Both statements come from The Writer’s Almanac, which, like everything else, needs your financial support.Today there is this, from James Wright, who, like me, went to Kenyon College.  He’s talking about thinking he was done with poetry and discovering he was not:“Sometimes there is a force of life like the spring which mysteriously takes shape without your even having asked it to take shape, and this is frightening, it is terribly frightening. …Being a poet sometimes puts you at the mercy of life, and life is not always merciful.”And on Sunday, there was this from poet and novelist JimHarrison:“Life is sentimental. Why should I be cold and hard about it? That’s the main content. The biggest thing in people’s lives is their loves and dreams and visions, you know.”Yes, exactly! As poets we resist and fear being sentimental--that is, asking for more emotion that is warranted, or manipulating the reader (jerking the tears), or telling the reader how to feel, etc. But, sometimes, we should…yes, fear not! And remember that our “loves and dreams and visions” already connect to theirs.Now, I could complain about male writers getting away with tender, honest statements like this and women writers getting dismissed or insulted for similar tenderness…but I won’t. That’s been said before, noticed by many. I want to be done with that and let us all speak as openly and honestly as we want in our poems. And, anyway, the tenderness was criticized in these male writers—for instance, in this Poetry Foundation article about Wright. But tenderness seldom bothers tender-hearted me, and one of my favorite poems is “A Blessing.” Oh, how I love the tender eyes and ears of those ponies “[j]ust off the highway to Rochester, Minnesota.”We are sentimental. Being a poet is frightening.Fortunately, there’s chocolate. And mashed potatoes. Not together though, OK?"},

I have to say I like the revisions that emerged in the movie and in recordings since.Here is the youtube clip of Judy Garland singing the song to Margaret O'Brien in the window seat scene, complete with the smashing of the snow people! The first time I saw this movie, that scene amazed me--very dark, very crazy, real tears. I guess Margaret O'Brien was quite well known for her real tears.But it was a beautiful, sunny, blue-sky day on this Blue Monday in the blog.

Not everybody in my book group enjoyed Weiner's whiny humor, but Man Seeks God sounds like a book I will seek out, being, if not a \"gastronomical Jew,\" at least, like him, a perpetual seeker.Plus there is the coincidence of seeking out Sufism, which I did accidentally in Arizona on the desert at a Catholic poets' retreat. Haven't I already told you this story? Never mind. Let's just say Weiner and I both like the Sufi poet Rumi. So, sue me.Woman Seeks PoinsettiaRecently I said to my husband, \"I like keeping things alive,\" which he was happy to hear. I was referring to houseplants and pot plants I'd brought indoors to keep alive over the winter. I've also managed to keep a poinsettia alive since an after-Christmas sale at the grocery store last season. This one was thriving outside during the hot, sometimes wet, sometimes dry summer, and doing OK inside, too, until I re-located it, twice.First, it was in a spot under the counter getting plenty of sun from the sliding glass patio doors, but getting bumped and broken by people who don't pay attention to poinsettias in pots. So I moved it to the downstairs bathroom, mainly to cover up a hole in the wall (don't ask), but also in hopes of protecting it and giving it the indirect window light that the African violets seem to love.Poinsettias do not love this same light.So now it is pale and spindly, but maybe, just maybe, this is the spindliness before the storm of red color?I fear not.For red color, tips on poinsettias, and a picture of hers, see Kristin Berkey-Abbott's blog today!

Yoga in the morning now, so why not do it at night? (P.M. Yoga, the other obvious choice, is too much for me.)This is a roundabout way (my usual way) of getting to the subject of yesterday's second-Sunday-of-Advent reflection, \"Fear Not,\" by Bob Ryder, the husband half of our doubled pastor. I did find it comforting and sustaining, and it was fun to remember that I have a poem called \"Fear Not\" based on the renovation of beautiful Uptown Normal, when a big crane sat there for months. Now, where there was once a hole in the street, there is a lovely award-winning traffic circle of green space.Driving my daughter to school in my pajamas, I got to listen to some more of her music, this time \"Breakable\" by Ingrid Michaelson, on the album Girls and Boys, about our fragility. Lyrics here.

Blood moon is one of the names of a full October moon (see Farmer's Almanac), and a blue moon is an extra full moon in a season, so I put them together and got this, though now the term \"blue blood\" resonates a bit for me as the end of aristocracy, as I just saw a beautiful production of Three Sisters at Heartland Theatre, and I can't remember the Italian for \"window\" or \"ceiling.\" I understudied Irina years ago at Steppenwolf Theater, so my past is laying me flat with steamroller force...Oh, yes, this is a Random Coinciday in the blog.

{"title": "Advent", "date": "Thursday, December 1, 2011", "text": "When I moved back to my hometown and started going to church, I was delighted by the home made and ongoing Advent wreath, a kind of art installation on the altar table. On the first Sunday of Advent, people bring rocks to shape in a semi-circle around the Advent candles that will be lit one at a time. The next Sunday, it's greens (evergreens or dried flowers or creative representations of greenery); then animals (photos of pets, figurines, toys); and, finally, humans.I was so charmed by this that I wrote a poem about it, which is now published annually in the December edition of the church newsletter. I am honored. It might not make sense to anyone but us, but here it is:AdventFirst, we bring rocks: earth curves in a bowaround the source, light.  Is it miracleor did rock bend always as the willow?What next?  Acorn, walnut, holly, bluebellpressed with a ribbon, tuft of baby’s breath,pine cone, lighting of the second candleby a child.  Magic again? Now our wreatha parade of fauna: camels, a cat, a cow,marble hippo, rocking horse.  Nothing yetprepares as well for what’s to come: our ownmeager arrival as human figurines,plaster or plastic, a fragile sturdy crowdof admirers, rigid with unspoken awe.We stand alive, wild at heart, hope raw.The first Sunday of Advent this year was actually November 27, when I stood on the train platform on Sunday morning, sending my son back to school instead of bringing a rock to the wreath. This Sunday I will take the weird little stand-up cardboard triangles of \"greens\" I've constructed from recycled greeting cards.Here is the reflection from that missed Sunday, if you, too, want to ponder the Sacred Mystery. I was struck by the lines quoted from Mark Nepo about the seeds cracked open in the dark. They remind me of Leonard Cohen's song \"Anthem,\" this famous verse:Ring the bells that still can ringForget your perfect offeringThere is a crack in everythingThat's how the light gets inI just heard him singing this in the documentary Leonard Cohen: I'm Your Man that I finally saw after many people had recommended it to me. Before I ever heard this song, I wrote a poem called \"Damage\" about banging on and cracking a wooden door and seeing the light stream in. People who read it and liked it alerted me to the famous Cohen song, which I have loved ever since. I wish I wasn't so clueless all the time...except that it allows me to fill with wonder repeatedly at the newness of what I've missed, or forgotten, thanks to the cracks in my brain.And thanks, again, to Jonathan Koch, for another branch of persimmons! And the first, in case you missed it."},
{"title": "Pajamas or Pyjamas?", "date": "Wednesday, November 30, 2011", "text": "OK, do you wear \"pajamas\" or \"pyjamas\"? If you wear \"pyjamas,\" you are \"chiefly British,\" according to my American Heritage Dictionary. I love to look up words, and have looked up this one before, forgetting and then remembering that pajamas are loose-fitting Persian trousers, intended for sleeping or lounging. I wear mine to drive my daughter to school in the early, early morning.While I did not see a windmill or a little person standing on the peak of a barn roof, as in this wonderful screenprint by Daniel Danger, the sky was this blue that early. Danger's art accompanies the new poetry feature just up at Escape Into Life: Bertha Rogers. I hope you will visit it to see more and to read her wonderful poems. Notice how she's a bit of a Chesire cat in her author photo!!And I love that this one, in its title, hast thou slain the jabberwock?, references \"Jabberwocky,\" by Lewis Carroll!Have a good hump of the week!(I don't think the Jabberwock is wearing pajamas.)"},
{"title": "Feeding Time", "date": "Tuesday, November 29, 2011", "text": "I remember when this book arrived in summer, just in time for me to take it to the beach to read! It's full of fiddler crabs and other marine creatures. Of course, I was at the lake, not the ocean, but there was sand and water. I'm glad to be reading FeedingTime, by Emily Scudder, again now, as the cold comes on, so I can remember that summery shore.The first poem, \"Transitory Adhesion,\" introduces the conversational tone and a fine \"transitory\" randomness:Seagulls bore me.  I like this boredom.The mind can wander, like this.Snails latch onto other snails. Or a rock.Clump.With drop lines, kids fish.Pull them up. Throw them back.I once did that.Sand robins are ugly fish.And so forth. I can hear the water plopping. I can look around and see what she's seeing. I'm leaving out the heart of the poem now, the center, the personal, a loss, something for you to find on your own.  Now I'm looking around again, as she does, to recover. The poem resumesIs it the fiddler crabs?I count on crabs when other things change.I call this monotonous attachment.The ocean is like this: reused, remembered.The mind can wander, like this.And morning fog burns off, like it does.Oh, I love that repeated line, \"The mind can wander, like this,\" and the perfect use of a comma there, as demonstration of how easily it's done, this mind wandering, which the whole poem also demonstrates. I love the use of \"like\" here, too, conversationally, and especially in that last line, to resist simile and insist on what really happens, the morning fog burning off.I have so many favorite moments in this book, and so many come from its blunt honesty, its simplicity of statement. It's like the opposite of Virginia Woolf, but here's one I love called \"A Room of One's Own\" that takes place at a writer's retreat and begins:I am not very happy.I am supposed to be very happy.I am supposed to eat very well.I order clam dogs and Cokes.Clam dogs! I didn't even know such a thing existed, but I've wanted one ever since I read about it in this poem.The women at the Lobster Pot like me.The women at the women's bookstore like me.The women at the women's bookstore offer methe lesbian discount and I am pleased.I would be pleased, too! This poem keeps building to its solitary writing room and attached \"supposed to's\" and with wry humor and poignant honesty goes somewhere new that is somewhere familiar, too. I'll let you find it via Pecan Grove Press!But before you (and I) go, I want to give you the heart of another poem, this one called \"Because We All Die Someday.\" It opens with a Woolfean sentiment, \"And all I want is an hour to myself,\" which is also a Rita Dove sentiment...or any hardworking woman's sentiment, especially the writer kind. But here's exactly what I identify with, connecting me to my mother, who mows, and grandmother, who picked up sticks in the yard, and to the chores we ask our kids to help us with:When I pick sticks off the lawnmy kids hate to help. Groan.Why are we doing this anyway?Because I did when I was a kid.Because sticks jam the mower.Because we all die someday, and pickingsticks is a small thingand makes Grandma happy.I love that \"Groan,\" like the earlier \"Clump.\" I love, again, that simple repetition that gets the job done.Despite the reminder of death and the line \"I am not very happy,\" this book is full of animal joy and family joy. I love the poetic renewal of vows in \"If I Married You Again\" with its new wedding attire--\"I'd wear pants / and black boots\"--and its raw desire! (Ah, I appreciate this \"monotonous attachment\" so different from the snail's!) \"Throw my flowers like a shortstop.\"I celebrate this book the way she'd re-do her wedding:  \"Raise a fist / for the real of it.\"Poet Emily Scudder is also the founder of Fiddler Crab Review, dedicated to reviewing chapbooks, new or old. I was thrilled when I first found this site, kept reading and admiring, and now I do reviews there, too! So if you have a chapbook, here's where to send it!"},

The garden has two stalwart mums in bloom and new growth: columbine and pinks just up from the ground, thanks to that long Indian Summer in October and a warm November.There are even patches of new grass since the last mow. And on the curb, mountains of leaves awaiting the post-holiday leaf pickup. I took a chilly walk into town for fresh air and to shake off any post-holiday blues. All the time now I am buoyant on an ocean of joy, a calm ocean in this metaphor.And now a time of advent is coming, that death of the year that makes us put up lights and bring out candles. Soon I'll begin my own incessant playing of \"In the Bleak Midwinter.\" Pink Martini's Joy to the World. Blind Boys of Alabama singing \"Go Tell it on the Mountain.\"  The Trans-Siberian Orchestra's Lost Christmas Eve.   New this year, thanks to a gift last year, Tori Amos, Midwinter Graces.I love Christmas music!

{"title": "Emotional Opinion", "date": "Sunday, November 27, 2011", "text": "Ah, I like this definition of poetry as \"emotional opinion,\" which I found in Ruth Stone's obituary in the New York Times. She died at 96, so she had a good (I hope) long life, though filled with sorrow and struggle. A poet's life.I read her book In the Next Galaxy last year and will seek out her others, gradually, if I can bear it. The obituary quotes from a couple of the poems about her husband's suicide, and here's another set of lines: \"What is imperative is the Off switch; / which he, at one point some time ago, / opted for himself.\" She opted to live, and to write, and I am glad of it, but now the Off switch has been flicked for her.Also sad to learn of the death of biologist Lynn Margulis, a favorite of mine. She was a trailblazer in evolution-ary theory, proposing symbiosis as one path to new life forms, not just random mutation. She allows for a kind of altruism as the basis of life, not just selfish survival, as evolution is so often interpreted, and her definition of \"altruism\" is, likewise, not the selfish conventional one in biology, which reduces it. That is, to preserve life itself, Margulis suggested, two organisms may share materials and give up their own lives, which is different in essence from those who say the organism is simply desperately trying to save itself and randomly produces something new. Since, in both cases, this is an unthinking intention, as far as we know, someone might say it is just two ways of seeing/stating the same thing. Fine. But they are importantly different ways of seeing/stating, with ramifications beyond biology, and Margulis's own research provided evidence at first rejected, now accepted in mainstream evolutionary theory.Not surprisingly, she is also the mother of Gaia theory, which should interest and please some science fiction lovers, and was once married to Carl Sagan (\"billions and billions\" of stars).And one more recent loss: Shelagh Delaney, the author of the play A Taste of Honey. I am thankful that these women lived and wrote, teaching us what to value and how to live, which, as always, is why I read.And thanks, again, to Jonathan Koch, for the persimmons, pears, and mandarin."},

Then I might loll in bed for a half hour, awake but pondering life. I love when I wake in joy. Waking in anxiety, or in nothingness, tends to happen at 3:00, or 3:03, or 3:06. An excellent time to read a book. But, hey, what isn't an excellent time to read a book?This morning I woke remembering to post Poems of Thanks and Praise over at Escape Into Life, a mini-anthology of lovely poems by 4 poets whose names link to their solo features there. It has gorgeous art by Christy Lee Rogers, reminding us of the glory and beauty of the human body and the eternal dance. Of the swirls of water and air and color everywhere in our lives. And the darkness always in the background.And there is a quiet political statement in the center of her feature in a piece called The Promise that seems terribly pertinent this particular Thanksgiving in America, when many are hungry and suffering, or fearful and uncertain; when many are actively protesting injustice; when many are still not seeing or solving the problem; when a few keep a brutal hold on the money, power, and status quo. I'd like to see us instead come together in a feast of thanksgiving and peace. But I see that the promise holds the shape of a V, as for Victory, and remains open to interpretation.Please enjoy the poems of thanks and praise of Susan Rich, Richard Jones, Maureen E. Doallas, and Robert Lee Brewer, and escape into your beautiful life."},
{"title": "Bravo, Farewell", "date": "Tuesday, November 22, 2011", "text": "This beautiful magazine, the fall issue of Confrontation, arrived in the mail this morning, with a poem of mine in it. For that honor, I give thanks. The cover art is a detail from a painting by Claudio Bravo, called Red, Rose and Orange Paper, courtesy of the Marborough Gallery in New York. Bravo's art is featured inside as well in a color portfolio at the center of the magazine, beautifully done.Alas, Bravo died this summer in Morocco, where he made his home. He was Chilean, and his work was shown all over the world. I am glad he had a long life, and that his art had come to this \"crescendo,\" as Edward J. Sullivan puts it in his essay in Confrontation. I look forward now to reading the poems and stories in this issue! So far I have allowed myself the prizewinning poem by Zoe Donaldson, \"Nonesuch,\" a gentle elegy and a villanelle.I will also allow myself some pumpkin bread this morning, as I have baked loaves for Thanks-giving gatherings and an extra loaf for us to eat now, and some pumpkin muffins with cream cheese frosting...but those are to take to Phyllis, home from surgery and rehabilitation just in time for the holiday."},
{"title": "A Handy Image", "date": "Monday, November 21, 2011", "text": "As I had hoped and predicted, the subject in church yesterday was the sheep and the goats on the left and right hands of God in Matthew 25:31-46, and you can read it here, in the Reflecting Pool. It is written by Bob Ryder, the husband half of the powerhouse duo that is Our Double Pastor, aka the s/he unit. I am comforted by Bob's suggestion that division into sheep and goats is \"a handy image,\" not a casting of aspersion onto goats, whom I dearly love for their drunken goat cheese. (See handy image at left hand of blog.)Though I did not attend church that morning, Matthew turned up at the kitchen table during the poetry workshop, as we tracked down a reference to \"Rachel weeping for her children\" in one of the poems, a New Testament Rachel (common name) weeping after Herod's murder of the children.All too timely, this harming of the innocent by those protecting the powerful and the status quo. Sigh.... A reason to be blue on a Blue Monday, despite the beautiful blue sky. (See handy image at right hand of blog.)Yet, in the midst of my country's current troubles, and trouble all over the world, I am thankful and full of praise and a sustaining joy as we enter Thanksgiving week. For those of you who celebrate this holiday, have a good one. I will probably post on into mid-week. If I am silent for a time, I am giving thanks with family."},

{"title": "Shall Not Perish", "date": "Saturday, November 19, 2011", "text": "It's true that I get a lot of my news from NPR and Comedy Central (via Hulu). So I often get it highlighted and/or a day late.Or on Facebook, via links to timely stuff in various publications. It's random but not more biased than Fox News--indeed, much less so, as I can glean from clips from Fox News on The Colbert Report.My scatter shot method works rather well in keeping me informed and exposing me to a variety of points of view. It is a far cry, of course, from my days at the City News Bureau, where my job was to read the paper--several papers, every single day, and clip the leading news stories, especially local, to have background information to give to reporters who called in for it so they could understand the context for what they were covering that day, and to flesh out the story for their readers, as needed.Today various things come together on the anniversary of the Gettysburg Address, Abraham Lincoln's famously succinct speech at the dedication of the soldiers' cemetery in Gettysburg, PA. In honoring the dead, Lincoln also encouraged us to recommit to democracy itself and make sure that \"government of the people, by the people, and for the people, shall not perish from the earth.\" I think the Occupy movement is another instance of this, a reminder \"by the people, and for the people\" that the \"government of the people\" ought to remember its purpose and not favor the rich nor continue to rig the system toward the advantage of the few.Comic and cosmic ironies are the specialty of sweet Stephen Colbert, whose feature \"The Word\" on November 17 pointed to the idiocy of a Super Congress who would take health benefits from the 1%, meaning veterans, to help balance the budget, instead of taxing the 1%, meaning the super rich, which would be fairer.Meanwhile, on The Daily Show, Sarah Vowell came on to remind us of Evacuation Day, November 25, when the last of the British troops left Manhattan, marking the very end of the American Revolutionary War. Many of us are unaware of that former holiday, as it was taken over by Thanksgiving, as Vowell notes, humorously casting the blame on Abraham Lincoln, the same guy who did not want us to forget the Civil War dead and what they had done for us.And for another interesting war connection and collection of observations on what's going on today and how it fits into a historical context, please visit Confessions of Ignorance on the Bonus Army, a World War I soldiers' protest during the Great Depression...The winding and layering of our stories somehow also coincides with Leonard Cohen: I'm Your Man, a documentary film about the songwriter, and his story of a great general who suddenly sees the truth about war, with a Lincoln-like melancholic awareness, but is reminded by Krishna that he is a warrior and must do his work and be what he is, anyway, though all these people will die, including himself. What are we to do?We shall perish. What shall not?"},
{"title": "Presumed Dead", "date": "Friday, November 18, 2011", "text": "Speak of the devil! Or the \"presumed dead,\" as I sometimes mark poetry submissions that have been gone far too long. I refer here to the submission, or even the magazine itself, not to my poems. Many of my poems may be presumed dead, too, but I can resurrect them, or, egad, cannibalize them, and voila! new poems, or, rather, the poems they were probably always meant to be.In What Counts, a recent blog entry on tallying submissions, rejections, acceptances, etc., I referred to the \"presumed dead\" that I try to deal with responsibly by inquiring about and then officially withdrawing. Today I finally received back in the mail my self-addressed stamped envelope with 5 poems submitted August 26, 2010--so, a year and 3 months ago--with a nice, handwritten note apologizing for the delay and ending, \"Best of luck, & try us again.\"It's been an emotional morning. I finished Home, by Marilynne Robinson, and wept. Why? It's hard to explain, but I think I wept at the beauty, the mystery, the love, and the hope. OK. Read it yourself, then, as in read it and weep.And I've been listening to Leonard Cohen songs all morning while baking red velvet cupcakes for my daughter's birthday. It's the beauty again, in Cohen, and the raw truth. Hearing them in the light of Home was almost unbearable, in a good way. Cooking, without Cohen, might have been unbearable in a bad way.And speaking of Joan of Arc and the song of Bernadette...that is, Leonard Cohen songs...what you see above are some exotic angels from this website, with info about them. I found some exotic angels recently at my grocery store and took them to a friend in the hospital, and then they were marked down, tempting me terribly, so I got some for myself, too. Mine are a paler yellow and a paler orange than these but similarly beautiful. Here's another website with info \"all about exotic angel plants,\" the name for a variety of houseplants trademarked by Hermann Engelmann Greenhouses of Florida, and I was glad to learn that some are begonias, what I had guessed about my own, based on leaf and stem. I had been afraid to Google \"exotic angels,\" so finding solid plant info instead of scantily-dressed dancers or Victoria's Secret models, or worse, was a comfort!Not that there's anything wrong with exotic dancing or fancy bras."},

So the mums are in a crystal vase, a wedding present nearly 22 years ago!This painting, by John William Waterhouse, in the public domain, is titled Gather Ye Rosebuds While Ye May, a quotation from the poem by Robert Herrick about enjoying youth and beauty while you can.Today, another \"bright sunshiny day\" but colder than yesterday, I celebrate ekphrasis (poetry in response to painting) in addition to this painting in response to a poem! Ekphrasis journal, which gave me the Ekphrasis Prize for my poem \"Repose,\" has honored and delighted me again by now nominating it for a Pushcart Prize.

{"title": "Bright Sunshiny Day", "date": "Wednesday, November 16, 2011", "text": "It's another bright sunshiny day out there today, so I've got this Johnny Nash song running through my head: \"I Can See Clearly Now.\" I'm not sure I can see clearly now, about all things, but I'd like to, and I do have some perspective on a few things. Wouldn't it be nice to become a true elder, a repository of some of the wisdom of the ages? Sigh...But now, thanks to the word \"clear,\" I've also got the song \"On a Clear Day You Can See Forever\" running in my head, sung by Barbra Streisand, though I don't know if I've ever actually seen the film all the way through. Is there a scene with Barbra standing like a figurehead singing on a ship? The plot of the film and the play involve clairvoyance, based on reincarnation.Clearer in my head, is a scene from the play version, with Barbara Harris, played live on television, in black and white, probably as a promotion for the Broadway show. Fuzzier in my head is how and why I viewed this recently. Barbara Harris is an utterly charming performer, and a wacky one! The play, a musical, as is the film, is sort of loosely based on Berkeley Square, a sort of time travel adventure, so the layering and reincarnating just keep going on, not increasing my clairvoyance, but definitely enhancing the origami of my brain.For more bright sunshine, plus clarity, wisdom, rust, and high heels, see this guest blog post by poet Karen J.

{"title": "Pruning Roses", "date": "Monday, November 14, 2011", "text": "Yesterday was fall clean-up day at the church garden. I remembered thick gloves, and could not fit my rake into my car, so I was given the job of cutting back the roses. Happy to do it. I should have worn longer, thicker sleeves, but no harm done. I took a windbreaker but did not need a coat at all, after all, thanks to the warm weather. The wind was feisty but the roses are in an enclosed area.After the fact, I read this advice on pruning roses from the All-America Rose Selections (rose.org) website, but, if I remember, I can apply this to my own trellis roses, in late winter, as they recommend. Perhaps a little later than January or February in my weather/gardening zone, depending on the actual conditions this winter and...global warming.Meanwhile, I am pruning poetry, always a good idea. And still reading and marveling at Home, by Marilynne Robinson. I admire the subtlety and focus, the attention to the inner life.Today I gasped at this, a description of the \"black sheep\" of the family, or prodigal son, Jack:The brightness in his face meant anxiety. When he was anxious a strange honesty overtook him. He did understandable things for understandable reasons, answering expectation in terms that were startlingly literal, as if in him the skeletal machinery of conventional behavior, the extension and contraction of the pulleys of muscle and sinew, was all exposed. I am like this, too, so I identify with Jack, though not a black sheep nor a prodigal son. In terms of life narrative, I am more like Jack's sister, Glory, the good girl who came home to tend her father, after some trouble away from home. But not trouble of Jack's sort, as the paragraph goes on:And he was aware of this, embarrassed by it, inclined to pass it off, if he could, as irony, to the irritation of acquaintances and strangers, and, she [his sister, Glory] could only imagine, employers and police. I am aware of and embarrassed by my own excruciating honesty and transparency and tendency always to make things worse by way of this awareness, so that everything I do is the \"wrong\" thing, only reinforcing the conventional expectations of those who find me in the wrong. There's no way out. But what a comfort to find a character to identify with in this, and an author who understands it.But more than that, the man was at once indecipherable and transparent. Of course they watched him. That is, in the moments after their conventional expectations about his wrongness are confirmed, he is his usual transparent, indecipherable self, and I think I strike some of my friends and acquaintances this way, too. May they forgive me. I have, I hope, a good heart.Blue roses thanks to Wikipedia and Wikimedia! And Christopher Goodband."},
{"title": "The Third Servant", "date": "Sunday, November 13, 2011", "text": "Ah, my excellent pastor has sent me back to my bible (King James version, blue cover), Matthew 25:14-30, the story of the three servants, which comes right after the story of the ten virgins, five of them foolish and without lamp oil. Here is Susan's account of \"The Third Servant--Coward or Hero?\" at the Reflecting Pool. I very much appreciated her historical reminder that the listeners at this time would not have identified with either master or slave, and would not have approved of \"usury,\" or interest (money making money), or \"ursury,\" as it is spelled in my King James version. What struck me on this third reading was that the master gave his slaves each 5 talents, 2 talents, or 1 talent \"to every man according to his several ability,\" an odd reversal of communism: from each according to his ability, to each according to his need. (A talent is a huge unit of money, also important in Cleopatra's time!) And also that these verses are followed by the famous sheep and goats verses, which might tempt someone to connect the sheep on the right hand with rich usurious slaves and the goats on the left hand with the poor one-talent slave sent off to weep and gnash his teeth. Watch out for temptation, I'd say. I suspect that this is a contrast, not a comparison, this sheep and goats business, or a completely new metaphor, nothing to do with slaves or virgins!Anyhoo, Susan pointed out this section of Matthew often shows up during the fall stewardship campaign at a church, and she did not use it that way. Instead, she challenged herself and us to think of it in light of current events (Occupy Wall Street) and local protests (against high interest rates on payday lending) and/or not in light of that, but for its own sake. What are we to glean from such a parable?I glean a warning similar to that of Philip Levine, the current poet laureate of the United States and a champion of the working person. He is a feisty troublemaker, as you can see in this interview in the New York Times Magazine, and a courageous man, not at all afraid to say what he thinks. A \"slave\" to no one.\"There’s a kind of Protestant ethic that believes that if you’re really a good person, God will reward you with a full table and a garage full of automobiles and a beautiful husband or wife — that we should be judged by what the world has delivered to us,\" says Levine, and I see that as a typical and problematic interpretation of the story of the third servant, as if 1) we are supposed \"create wealth\" given to us by an unjust, \"hard man,\" a master of slaves and/or 2) we are to be judged by our apparent privilege, luck, and wealth, by our goods and not our deeds or our intent.  Sigh....  But the parable in Matthew is very rich, and very open to interpretation, however conveniently it may be used by anyone to make a point or justify a particular way of life. Eh?"},

The aim is to send out enough work to earn 100 rejections, and here in the \"first\" quarter (Sept., Oct., Nov.) I have sent out 25 packets, and we are only halfway through November, a nice cushion in case of a later slump. I've had 11 rejections since September 1, 2 acceptances, and the rest are still pending. In the meantime, of course, there have been rejections, acceptances, and publication of work sent out earlier--including a couple nice surprises.Also, as we approach year's end, I am tidying up by officially withdrawing poems from places that have exceeded their usual reporting time, or marking others as \"presumed dead\" if even the withdrawal process seems not to matter here. In the Accepted folder, awaiting publication, are 15 poems yet to appear in fall, winter, and spring publications. And I'm doing a pretty good job of sending more when a publication says, \"Please send more.\"Meanwhile, in the blog, hedgehogs still lead the pack, with 80,471 hits on \"Hedgehog Hodgepodge.\" My origami brain still runs second and has no hope of catching up. Posts with picture of bananas and mousetraps are also very popular.

After that, and “Ae Fond Kiss,” I was in love with Eddi Reader (and Robert Burns, of course, whom I had met in high school) forever.*Have I mentioned that I must listen to music in order to cook? My family always forgives my infatuations.Currently I am listening to Angels & Electricity and obsessing on the song “Wings on My Heels,” which I think of, fondly, as “Three-Quarter Time.”  To quote Eddi Reader:(and please hear this in three-quarter time!):I never was too good at dancingsomewhere I’d step out of linebut I knew that I hadwings on my heelswhen they played in three-quarter timeI love that line “somewhere I’d step out of line” for its rebellious as well as its self-deprecating qualities. And I’m sort of OK at dancing! What I was never too good at was math.As the song continues, the local boys have a lot of swagger but then they “hold on for dear life / when they played in three-quarter time.” Love that.To continue with Eddi Reader:one by onethey pulled down those mirrored hallsone by onethe winters came forgetting namesThis may comfort me as winter comes.To return to Eddi Reader (and Boo Hewerdine):money might slip through my fingersand there won’t be much to call minebut I’ll know that I hadwings on my heelswhen they playedin three-quarter timeThis may make ¾ sense, but, with full joy, I say, “Happy full moon!”"},

{"title": "The Jackal at the Door", "date": "Friday, November 4, 2011", "text": "OK, I am in love now with Eleanor Lerman, who wrote this book of poems, The Sensual World Re-Emerges. It had been on my wish list for a while, and, yes, I judged a book by its jackal-headed cover, and I read it now, end of October, beginning of November, at the end of my first surge of Cleopatra research (for a project next October!) I quoted from Lerman's days-of-the-week poem in yesterday's blog entry.You can learn about more Eleanor Lerman here, her own web site, which lists her books, and where I was pleased to find her new novel, Janet Planet, from Mayapple Press. I had seen the cover (wolf head floating on crescent moon) visiting Mayapple before, but this time I got smacked in the head with it.The Egyptian God Anubis wore a jackal head and was associated with mummification and the afterlife. (Thank you, Wikipedia, and thank you, Wikimedia, for the free-use images!) Lerman's poems have death and worry lurking in them and are also hilarious, often, so I am gripped with fear and haunted by...a weird vicious delight while reading them. They speak with an odd floating urgency.They also give me something to be cranky about in the proofreading department. Just like my mom, I find myself reading with a pencil and making little corrections—adding a \"d\" here, deleting a \"y\" there, and shuddering at the use of \"lightening\" for \"lightning.\" Once again, I ask, \"Why, why isn't an editor doing this?\" How can a fine book of poems like this get out into the world with errors like that? (And I don't know who to blame, a proofreader or the lack of a proofreader, or a copy editor who introduced the errors instead of correcting them...and why am I so darn persnickety?)The lack of periods also drives me a little crazy, but that is a clear choice so I tell myself it has something to do with the meaning and the inextricability of form and content of poetry. I choose to think the lack of periods adds to the eerie floating quality in these poems. And sort of suggests immortality or afterlife**please note lack of period above**"},

Heh. Sigh. Thank goodness for online journals!  Anyhoo, I would be between Galway Kinnell and Carolyn Kizer.  Not bad at all!Not all of my books are alphabetized, or not all by author.  My personal bookcase is alpha-betized by title of journal or anthology, with my freestanding books slid in at \"K\" or lying atop the stacked books if used recently for a reading or a reference (as yesterday when a composer friend called in need of some lyrics!). In addition, not all of the journals fit, sizewise, on this shelf, Kaleidoscope, for example, a \"K\" journal, and Ninth Letter, and Seeding the Snow, so they are in various other places tall enough for them, or supportive enough, as Kaleidoscope and Seeding the Snow are tall and saddle-stapled.Elsewhere in the room are little stacks of books in what we might call random organization, helped up by bookends, with handmade dividers identifying them as waiting to be reviewed for Fiddler Crab, Prick of the Spindle, or Rattle, for instance, or lying atop the poetry shelves to be read, which is gently italicized on my brain. And a couple of books are 1) temporarily lost in the piles on my desk and computer desk and/or 2) in process.One of these is The Sensual World Re-Emerges, by Eleanor Lerman, and today, waiting for the computer to warm all the way up, I opened the book to my bookmark and read the poem \"The Days of the Week are Explained To Me,\" which, as a blogger who writes \"eight days a week\" is 1) right up my alley and 2) urgently necessary.How wonderful that it says, \"Plans / can be made on Thursday, next steps / mapped out.\" How reassuring! And also apt, as I have a meeting today to talk out some \"next steps.\"Ah, but how disconcerting, the next stanza: \"Therefore, she [the friend explaining the days of the week to the speaker of the poem, who is now the friend explaining the days of the week to random me] suggests, if we / intend to get anything done, / we must meet on Tuesday, / in a sober cafe, with sharpened / pencils and clean white pads...\"We are meeting in a \"sober cafe,\" for coffee. It is only open for breakfast and lunch and serves no alcohol!But Lerman continues, accessing \"zero at the bone\" chills for someone like me, and keeping me honest:as if we are normal peoplewith good intentionsAs if we have the kind of jobswhere we are paid with moneyAs if in our vicious little heartswe really want anything to changeMore on Eleanor Lerman's book later. That's all I can handle today, a Random Coinciday on a Thor's Day, a rainy, vicious Thursday in the blog.But with happy art by Mo Conlon, the paintings I Love This Rabbit, Sophia, and Joy Blessing, leading you to our Best of the Net Nominations at Escape Into Life."},

I woke with a headache--in the dream ascribed to a bear that was attacking us--and realized it was because of dehydration, the furnace now on. We escaped the bear by going into the other classroom, and closing the door by lifting up the hinged doorstop, which I managed through panic even though it is the kind of thing I cannot usually accomplish in dreams.Those of you who follow the news will find it easy to interpret my dream based on the recent escape and slaughter of wild animals in Ohio, but I was not aware of that news at all until this morning, preoccupied on the day it was happening by local grief, the death of a dog named Wolf.If you, too, missed that news, here is one of the recent stories about it. (I am not going to show any pictures of the dead animals, but they are out there.) This is a sad, sad thing, and surely better laws, education*, and awareness will result.*Is this why my dream was set in an educational institution?Meanwhile, I wondered about the impact of this event on a new movie due out for Christmas, We Bought a Zoo, based on a book about a real family who did this in England. Of course, the Wall Street Journal wondered the same thing, meaning economic impact, in their Speakeasy blog, in this piece, titled \"Will the Exotic Animal Slaughter in Ohio Hurt the Movie 'We Bought a Zoo'?\"The money aspect occurred to me, too, but I was mainly wondering about the tact issue, the shared concern over the welfare of animals, etc., and the charm of the movie as presented in the trailer I saw at The Big Year (the film about birders that just opened). I told my friend Kim Kimmel, mother of Wolf the dog, how glad I was of a nice family film coming out at Christmastime, etc. So now I'm hoping the movie will help with the education and awareness aspect and the revive the animals in joy.

I realized I had passed the house many times without knowing it when taking a certain route to drop my daughter off at school.I saw, in real life, up close, the swan and family paintings and drawings of Rosalind Al-Aswad, Chris's mother, that I'd seen only online before. I saw Chris's office, his library, his Gogol...Dead Souls.I saw the sweet, quiet corner at the top of the stairs set apart for Buddhist meditation.I am glad and grateful for this. Thank you, Basel.And this morning, looking once more at the family's tribute to Chris--this article and the magazine itself--I looked again at Chris's handwritten excerpt from Wordsworth's \"Ode: Intimations of Immortality...,\" a poem significant in my own youth in awakening my awe, for poetry and for everything.I had again that little shock of recognition, having known but forgotten that Chris and I were moved by the same thing. He mentions intuition in one of his last journal entries, and his own sense of recognition that a life can lead to one inevitable discovery: \"The best comparison is to a scholar or scientist who comes to discover that their life-work revolves around a single theme.\" I'll be pondering this all day, and thereafter."},

{"title": "She Slumps There Shredding Documents", "date": "Thursday, October 20, 2011", "text": "I've been enjoying the blog and poems of Kristin Berkey-Abbott for some time now, and today I'll tell you a bit about her chapbook I Stand Here Shredding Documents. The title alludes to a famous Tillie Olsen short story, \"I Stand Here Ironing,\" from her collection Tell Me a Riddle.Berkey-Abbott's poetry chapbook handles themes and concerns similar to Olsen's--work life, the working person; women and their work lives, often domestic, or balancing domestic labors with other labors; women in family life. I Stand Here Shredding Documents is also a gentle, humorous, and pithy critique of contemporary life, particularly 20th- and 21st-century woman's place in it.The opening poem, for example, notes the irony of wildly expensive kitchen remodeling projects and television cooking shows in \"a culture that doesn't cook.\" In another, a fashion design student doesn't think she needs to know how to sew. What's important is the runway, the logo, the sexy slit. \"Besides, [she's] a little afraid / of the sewing machine.\"And of course today's working woman has left \"her ancestors' farms\" behind for the new crop of gas-guzzlers on their way to offices:She looks across the lanes of cars,row after row of metal husks,pod after pod with precisely one personper car, lying fertile,waiting to blossom in the workplace.Berkey-Abbott revisits myth and fairy tale to look at culture and her personal dilemmas, and also explores escape via \"Alternate Career Path #1\" (\"chief bread baker / to the Abbess) and \"Alternate Career Path #2 (\"dessert chef / to the homeless\").  I like her imaginary professions a lot--body and spirit nurtured and nurturing in both! She also gives herself and her readers the comic relief any of us might need after a long and tedious workday or day spent in \"Meeting Hell,\" also a slightly dismembered sonnet!I love her use of the mythological character of Penelope (here at her loom, as painted by Leandro Bassano), patiently weaving and unweaving her tapestry as she waits for her husband to come home, now displaced to the workplace as \"Penelope in the Office Cubicle,\" where she makes and dismantles a work chart, makes and pours out coffee, and endlessly revises departmental objectives. What comes home is the meaninglessness of our modern work lives.That is present in the title poem, too, which ends:I am a woman of file cabinetsand endless meetings of infinite boredom.I stand at the shredder,my daily friend, and think of workthat is never finished.But there's a sense in the book as a whole that some of the unfinished work is yet to come, after the regular workday, and isn't boring, and is meaningful, and it's here, woven into poems."},

{"title": "I Won the Ekphrasis Prize!", "date": "Tuesday, October 18, 2011", "text": "Usually I am a finalist, not the prizewinner, \"always a bridesmaid, never a bride,\" but in this case I actually won the Ekphrasis Prize for Poetry for 2011 from Ekphrasis, a literary magazine devoted to poems in response to visual art.I won for \"Repose,\" based on a painting by John White Alexander, pictured here (click link!) published in the Spring/Summer issue. The poem begins:There is no repose in the woman     draped across the divan          like milk spilling, or a white wave               crashing on a red velvet rock.So why am I showing you a picture of limoncello tiramisu? Well, I think there is some sensual connection, but also because I don't think I have the rights to show the painting, but the lemon tiramisu can be found here, at The LoveBite, with a recipe you can \"totally cheat on,\" and also here, at epicurious. Limoncello is a lemon liqueur. And it's Fat Tuesday in the blog.And we had limoncello tiramisu at my poetry workshop on Sunday afternoon in little glasses similar to the ones shown above (actually candle holders, as revealed by Ginny, the poet/cook, as anything cooked by me would not have been as delicious as this was, oh, my God!)Also, she brought some for my family, and I had a 2\" x 2\" square of it for breakfast on Monday morning, to prove my decadence, and I might do the same today, to celebrate Fat Tuesday, since I can't believe my husband didn't eat it all up last night after volleyball.I still await the fall issue of Ekphrasis, which, I think, will announce my award, but I think it is safe to announce it here, as not only was the check in the mail, it is also already in the bank, and I have silver-edged certificate. This was a total surprise, and editors Laverne Frith and Carol Frith just called me up out of the blue one day, September 10, to give me the good news.I am excited just remembering it, and I think I need some cake, lemon curd, limoncello, Mascarpone, and whipped cream."},
{"title": "Why I Love Shaw", "date": "Monday, October 17, 2011", "text": "I love George Bernard Shaw. Why? Let me count the ways:1.  He's brilliant.2.  He's funny.3.  He's brilliantly funny.4.  He tells the truth (as he sees it).5.  He's annoying.  (I like his kind of annoying.)I am starting a project that has me reading Cleopatra, A Life, by Stacy Schiff, and re-reading Caesar and Cleopatra, by George Bernard Shaw, and, pretty soon, Antony and Cleopatra, by William Shakespeare. (I will probably re-read Shakespeare's Julius Caesar, too, for good measure.)So yesterday I re-read Caesar and Cleopatra, prologue by the Sun God Ra (hawk's head) and Shaw's notes at the end and all. Ra reviews some history for us and scolds the British theatre-going public of Shaw's time in delightfully funny and annoying ways.  For example:And the gods smiled on Caesar; for he lived the life they had given him boldly, and was not forever rebuking us for our indecent ways of creation, and hiding our handiwork as a shameful thing. Ye know well what I mean; for this is one of your own sins.OK, I might find Shaw's use of the semi-colon annoying, as well as his lack of use of the apostrophe. Plus, I don't know well what Ra means, but I have some guesses.(That's Ra with a sun disk on his falcon head above, via Jeff Dahl and Wikimedia.) (And here's Shaw, looking sort of hawk-headed himself. I think it's the eyes. Or maybe the way he parts his hair.)All of this reading and re-reading is reminding me of my undergraduate major, Poetry and Political Philosophy, at Kenyon College, actually a \"synoptic major\" in English, Drama, and Political Science. My thesis was on the character of Caesar in Shakespeare in Shaw. This time around I will be focusing on Cleopatra. And spending some time with Mark Antony.But at the moment I am looking at how Shaw looks at Julius Caesar, as a great and original man:Originality gives a man an air of frankness, generosity, and magnanimity by enabling him to estimate the value of truth, money, or success in any particular instance quite independently of convention and moral generalization....He knows that the real moment of success is not the moment apparent to the crowd. Hence, in order to produce an impression of complete disinterestedness and magnanimity, he has only to act with entire selfishness; and this is perhaps the only sense in which a man can be said to be naturally great.Shaw pursues this kind of Superman in various characters in his plays, poo-poohing the conventions of his own times:[The] distinction between virtue and goodness is not understood in England: hence the poverty of our drama in heroes. Our stage attempts at them are mere goody-goodies. Goodness, in its popular British sense of self-denial, implies that man is vicious by nature, and that supreme goodness is supreme martyrdom. Not sharing that pious opinion, I have not given countenance to it in any of my plays.I do so love his annoying self confidence! And his frank expression of doubt:The really interesting question is whether I am right in assuming that the way to produce an impression of greatness is by exhibiting a man, not as mortifying his nature by doing his duty, in the manner which our system of putting little men into great positions (not having enough great men in our influential families to go round) forces us to inculcate, but as simply doing what he naturally wants to do.So much going on here! Shaw is:1. Talking about playwrighting--producing an impression of greatness--but of course today's politicians work on their image!2.  Damning the nepotism of British society...and that practice anywhere, ongoing.3.  Examining human nature, and assuming that man is not naturally vicious.4.  Differentiating natural selfishness from greed for money or power.5.  Criticizing Christianity: It must be a constant puzzle to many of us that the Christian era, so excellent in its intentions, should have been practically such a very discreditable episode in the history of the race.That puzzle continues.Meanwhile, here is the painting Cleopatra and Caesar by Jean-Leon Gerome. She appears to be emerging from a carpet, as Plutarch and Shaw tell it. Schiff says she was smuggled in by way of a hemp or leather bag.And, as I recall from The Apple Cart, Shaw's favored political system is the benevolent monarchy! If the monarch is indeed benevolent (not vicious) and natural."},

{"title": "Iodine", "date": "Saturday, October 15, 2011", "text": "I am reading Iodine, by Haven Kimmel, and I am absolutely gripped. I love Kimmel. This one is dark, and I am pulled right in by the archetype info--the main character is taking classes in archetypes in literature and psychology, and also a \"wounded women in literature\" class--while trying to figure out her own story.She's also reading about UFOs and abduction stories. Seeing some of the actual literature on this, when I worked at the used bookstore, published from 1947 on, always made me a little sick to my stomach. I was troubled in so many ways: something really happened, something happened and the government covered it up, UFO stories were a cover for something else icky that happened, or UFO story writers were playing on the vulnerabilities of the people who yearned for the stories to be true, for various reasons.Iodine is a blue-black solid in nature, or a metallic gray, and violet as a gas. The main character's eyes are violet. The title and author's name on the book cover are the deep purple of iodine as a gas. I've been calling my blooming mums maroon, but they have an aspect of iodine.Here is iodine as a gas in the laboratory, by Matias Molnar. Iodine is important in nutrition, and that's why our salt is iodized. A lack of iodine can lead to thyroid problems or mental retardation. Iodine is used in the X-ray process sometimes, also seen on the book cover. Tincture of iodine is a disinfectant. So far in the book, iodine has been used on the cuts of the main character as a child.I await illumination."},

The maroon mini mums have opened. The air is sweet. I celebrate with Confetti Crow.Ah, but as the leaves fall, the rejections begin to arrive in the 1 Year, 100 Rejections tally, begun, with Brett Elizabeth, on September 1.

The more usual response time is 1-3 months or 3-6 months for print journals, or sometimes 1-6 weeks for online journals. Of course, there have been other rejections and acceptances during this time, but I'm talking the tally since September 1. I love these little projects, for the sense of community!Now that the cemetery walk is over, my poetry workshop can meet again this Sunday, and I so look forward to that gathering!

{"title": "Stealing Thunder", "date": "Thursday, October 13, 2011", "text": "It's Thor's Day in the blog, but I hear no thunder; there's just a gentle drizzle. Looks like it will last all day, and we could use it!I've been wondering how to write about an odd thing that happened last night, when I attended a new play by a young playwright (still in college), but referencing \"stealing one's thunder\" is exactly how. The wonderful definition at The Phrase Finder tells the little theatre story that is the origin of this phrase. The playwright John Dennis invented a thunder sound effect for the short run of his play Appius and Virginia. The play failed, but the thunder was a great success, used soon after for a production of Macbeth.In response, Dennis may have said, \"Damn them! They will not let my play run, but they steal my thunder.\"Or he might have said, \"That is my thunder, by God; the villains will play my thunder, but not my play!\"At any rate, this incident is the source of \"stealing one's thunder,\" the act of using someone's else ideas or accomplishment to one's own advantage. And I witnessed an astonishing example of that last night.The play was well done, showing us \"old racism\" and \"new racism\" in powerful and charming performances by black and white actors, including a boy in second grade! Wow! A panel discussion followed that brought the audience together in just the ways desired by director Jamelle Robinson in her program note:The purpose of Soda is to bring up some social issues that are not openly discussed on a day to day basis. It is the goal of Kamaya Thompson (playwright)...to bring these issues out into the open so that they can be discussed and a change can come forth from our generation.But then an audience member, who had spoken earnestly during the discussion, got the last word/s...and during these last words walked up to the stage area, facing the audience, her back to the actors, playwright, director, and discussion moderator, and her \"comments\" revealed themselves to rhyme a bit, developing into a full-out spoken word performance.We all survived. There was graciousness and goodwill afterwards, people seeking each other out in joy and praise and to continue the discussion. But during the mingling, the spoken word artist handed out photocopied flyers of herself, with 3 of her poems, and, I discovered this morning, full contact information and lots and lots of copyright protection notices, some in boldface.I shake my head, if not my hammer, in disbelief. And I don't think she knows or cares that she stole a young woman's thunder.The painting above, by William Hogarth, is David Garrick as Richard III. It's from a production at the Drury Lane Theatre, where Garrick was theatre manager as well as actor, where Dennis's play had its short run, though it would have been pulled by the previous management, as Garrick wasn't there yet! Here, as Richard, he's experiencing some fear and regret. And here, in another painting by Hogarth, is a happier-looking Garrick with his wife!"},

While I was dead...Tomas Transtromer won the Nobel Prize for Literature and Sweden erupted in jubilation, and so did plenty of other people who love poetry! Over at Escape Into Life, you can read Patricia Clark's poems, including one called \"Poem Ending with a Line from Transtromer,\" and a beautiful line it is. So is the rest of her poetry.I interviewed Patricia Clark on her work, here, in the EIL Blog, and I was especially curious about her take on \"nature poetry\" and its stigma/sudden trendiness. She points out, quoting Gary Snyder, that it used to be \"'death' for a poet to be called a 'nature poet,'\" and I have certainly read guidelines that say, \"We don't want garden poems\" and heard editors say, \"I hate nature poems.\"I agree with Patricia that it's usually best to read the poem closely and see what's going on, rather than labeling and dismissing it, and I wish more readers and editors would do so. This ties in with The Geography of Bliss, too, by Eric Weiner, whose happiness research confirms that we find great joy in being open to nature and to the beauty of our surroundings.And nature is not all beauty, either. It's what's going on. (\"It's what's for dinner.\")Anyhoo, I'd be interested in your thoughts on \"nature poetry\" here or at the EIL Blog interview.  How do you define it? If you have written poems about nature, have you run into the stigma? If you are a reader, what turns you off or on in poems that include nature? If you are a reader and writer of poems, have you, too, noticed the irony or hypocrisy of \"eco-friendly\" poems emerging in an age that has tended to despise \"nature poetry\"?Here, again, is that great photo by Dana Col-cleasure, as, tomor-row, I head back to the cemetery, for the final weekend of the Voices from the Past Evergreen Cemetery Walk 2011.

No matter! Icelandic mythology, in the book called the Eddas, “could be a muddle of thought, but,” according to Hilmar the Happy Heathen, “everyone needs a belief system, in order to have these transcendental moments.”As Alice in Wonderland might say, in a happy mood, “Happier and happier.”Anyhoo, I find Iceland endearing, and right after reading that chapter, I cooked dinner while listening to Bjork. Vespertine, the swan CD. (See above, and click title for details.) It has a song on it called “Pagan Poetry.” Hilmar mentored Bjork.

{"title": "Show Up, Look Good", "date": "Wednesday, September 28, 2011", "text": "Show Up, Look Good is a soon-to-be-released novel by Mark Wisniewski. I read an advance copy of it that clearly states on the peach-colored cover, “Please do not quote for publication without checking against the final book,” so this is a personal response and not any kind of formal review. Mark has said it’s OK to quote from it, as long as I don’t misrepresent the book, and his publicist has sent me cover art—looks good, doesn’t it?—and permission to use it. (Also, I found a typo for him! Maybe he had time to fix it before the book’s official release.)You can find out more about the book here and here, and the scheduled release date is October 5, but I will be in the cemetery then, so I am writing about it on this Hump of the Week. Why?  Well, because this book starts with a bang, or, rather, a solitary act performed with a marital aid.I also promised Mark “no spoilers,” and I don’t think that spoils anything or reveals too much. I don’t think it misrepresents anything, either, as the book starts out and continues with this kind of casual and blunt humor, and contains “sexual situations” and a bout of hilarious snarkiness on the “MFA-at-NYU.”  There’s also an early hint of some poignancy to come. Literally, the book begins:I know of a secret murder, and I’ve loved a speechless man, and sometimes I’d like to tell someone how death and love have changed my life, but any of three thoughts give me pause.And then he, the author, speaking as she, the narrator (Michelle), lists the three obstacles to telling us all about it…and then proceeds to do so. And here’s where I point you to the interview that explains how the author/narrator are related, done with such charming transparency that I can forgive some things that usually annoy me:1) thinly disguised autobiography2) a man pretending to be a woman (to sell more books)*3) blatant substitution of a visual art for literary art as the occupation of the narrator***But, hey, what a fine ironic reversal of the way it used to be, except that it did not actually solve Mark’s marketing problem (again, see interview), perhaps rightly so!**But, hey, my husband, a visual artist, pursued me precisely because he had heard in college that poetry and painting were sister arts, so what’s my kecking problem?***(yes, yes, I know there are no corresponding asterisks for this) Thirdly, I think Mark probably wanted me to read this because his narrator is a woman from Kankakee, Illinois who heads off to New York City and gets caught up in show biz for a time (before dabbling with visual art), and I am a woman from small-town Illinois who was caught up in show biz for a time in the big city of Chicago (before dabbling with a visual artist). So, of course, I am an expert.And I say this is a book I would love to see as a movie because I think there is a core story, with the gentle wisdom of those opening lines (Mark is also a poet), that could be told efficiently, effectively, and well by a very good filmmaker. There are things Michelle must leave unsaid, so she says a lot of other things instead. Her ex-fiancé says she “thinks too much” and, in dialogue, she doesn’t talk too much, so the meandering narration may substitute for a thinking-too-much aspect of her personality, even while it obscures and delays rather than reveals the core narrative. A film could show the whimsy, edginess, and absurdity of Michelle’s life with camera angle and selection of detail, and perhaps even a bit of voiceover, while also pursuing the plot of the core story.

Good snack for a Halloween party?Wikipedia tells me this food product came out in the summer of 2011 (that's this summer), and I vaguely remember hearing about it and thinking, \"Who's going to eat that?\"That's still my question! Who is going to eat that? Did anybody? How did this product fare? How does it taste? Has anybody who reads this blog ever tasted it, bought it, found it on the shelves, etc.? (I am a pop culture...zombie...coming to trends late, perhaps resurrecting them in dreadful folly.)Of course I did see the film Soylent Green when it came out. I did not read the book it was based on, Make Room! Make Room!, by Harry Harrison, in which there were \"soylent steaks,\" not green wafers.Gives me second thoughts about going green. But great for a Fat Tuesday in the blog. Recipes here.P.S. Also already this morning, I redefined Zumba as a popular Zombie-based dance fitness craze that leaves you dead on your feet."},

(You might have to wait a bit for the banner art at the top to upload, but it's worth the wait.)  So many fine poems, an essay, an interview--so much to enjoy in this inaugural issue of IthacaLit.I appreciate the editors' view of art and their suggestion about how to enjoy it:“Please sit down with your favorite cup & journey to that home inside you, reached when we connect with powerful writing and strong images. The best art holds a slightly different journey with each visit.

Yes, long book title!I love it.I did give my own poetry workshop this same assignment: write a very short poem with a very long title.  Here's one I wrote myself:What doesn't make us better makes usbitter.It's short enough to be put in the category of poems we can also call epigrams. Who knows? Maybe this is an existing epigram, but my arrangement of it makes it a short poem. All I know is, I certainly felt that when I wrote it, and it seemed funny to me in echoing such useful but often annoying, cloying platitudes as \"What doesn't kill us makes us stronger.\" Which is probably true, but, on some days, pisses me off.Oops, I've just had to add \"Cranky Doodle Day\" to the labels for this post. But I wasn't cranky when I started it. I just remembered my bitterness! Ah, the power of short poems.Anyhoo, I look forward to reading your short poems over at the EIL blog post on Sloat!And I highly recommend her book.

I did not have a parasol, like this woman in a Library of Congress photograph, posted here, at the Visit Gettysburg site, which the Civil War Era Dresses page tells us was to protect fine ladies and their skin from the sun. I was in the mercantile class, the wife of a shopkeeper.All the characters this year lived during the Civil War, as this is the 150th anniversary of that conflict. It's a sad thing to remember but probably good to reflect on, so we don't let current divisions and political conflicts get the best of us, eh? And that Wikipedia link takes us to the controversy of such a \"celebration,\" as well.This stark photo shows a prisoner released from the infamous Andersonville Prison, a confederate prisoner-of-war camp where the conditions were awful, many died from hunger and disease, and many who lived never fully recovered. The prison commandant was convicted of war crimes for his ill treatment of the prisoners. This is a Union soldier who survived.I'm keeping him in mind as I go about my own peaceful, healthy, happy life.

If we're lucky s/he's a good guy/gal! And there. Most of the time. And listening. At least some of the time.Another great place for motherhood poems is Literary Mama: Reading for the Maternally Inclined, and I probably directed you to my poem there, \"After the Playground,\" when it appeared in August. It has acquired some comments since, one added today by me, incorporating a typo, I see, after I came back to re-do, having failed originally to type in the \"code words\" that allow me to post by proving I am not spam.Sigh...evidently, I was spam.I tried not to be too cranky in responding to a comment by \"Chris,\" who did not leave his/her last name. Is that my sister Chris? I don't think so, as I think the tone of the comment is accusing me of some dishonesty and calling me \"clueless,\" but maybe I am too sensitive to slight.**pause to clarify: 1) I am too sensitive to slight 2) but I have a sense of humor and get over myself almost immediately now, after many years of practice, and just laugh 3) especially if I can vent a little in my personal blog, where I reveal everything: weakness, strength, flaws, typos, outright mistakes, human frailty, silliness, and sometimes a flash of thigh**It was time to get a little cranky, too, as Cranky Doodle Day has been sorely under-served in this blog.Anyhoo, I hope you will go read some motherhood poems at Adanna and Literary Mama.And note that Adanna has a call for submissions for the Featured Poets Page up now for poems on the theme of \"body image.\""},

And since it's the back yard, we might not get a letter from the city! The front yard is pretty scraggly--two huge trees (roots, shade), extended dry spell. But if it gets over 8 inches tall, in an effort to encourage new growth and deepen the roots, you can bet the town will send a gentle reminder to mow. Nobody complains about the back yard.So the back yard has: red and white clover, wild strawberries, crab grass, various bluegrasses, leftover lawn grasses, plantain, black cohosh, corn, violets (state flower), nettles, dandelions, spearmint, lemon balm, the various perennials and wildflowers I have planted in beds at the edges and corners, asters, raspberries, a bit of bedstraw, and scattered delicious as yet unidentifed prairie plants.And a trailing, still-blossoming cantaloupe vine. I was warned that this would happen in this zone: lush growth and blossoms, death before fruition. (My life in a cantaloupe rind.)Third, thanks again to Jonathan Koch for his wonderful art.

I love this project and have started keeping track, myself, as of September 1, 2011, in the spirit of Brett Elizabeth Jenkins, blogger/poet. You've got to love someone who calls herself the Angry Grammarian, right?!Also, in honor of Brett, I am making it a Cranky Doodle Day on Thor's Day in the blog. Partly because I was so disappointed to start reading a literary journal received recently--looking forward to poems by poets I admire--and having to set it aside after finding three significant typos by page 18.  (And, you know, there's front matter, so the poems didn't even start till page 5.)I'm OK with typos and even grammatical errors in blogs.  (Forgive me, Brett, if you ever come here, as you are likely to find some!) Blogs are quickly posted and often informal.But a literary magazine has an editor!One always hopes the poet has a chance to proofread her/his/hir poem, but that's not always the case. One hopes there's a chance to send the poem electronically, so there won't be errors introduced in re-typing or corrected from scanning. Again, not always the case.It's true, I picked up the magazine later, to give it another chance, and this time just skipped around in it, seeking out poems by some whose names I recognized. Immediately, an error of \"lie\" and \"lay\" confusion, evidently the fault of the poet. Again, there's an editor! If the editor does not know the difference or make the change, then what?I do sound cranky, don't I? I must hasten to confess that I have introduced errors into the editing or proofreading process of my own work, often stymied by technology or stupefied by lack of caffeine, sometimes just plain wrong. So I know it happens, and I accept and forgive all concerned.Except...there's an editor! Isn't there? Sigh....Anyhoo, I was tempted to cheat on the 1 Year, 100 Rejections project I started for myself on September 1. If only I had started on August 30! I would have an immediate acceptance, one of those rare, wonderful things, on August 31!But, no, as of September 1, instead I have an immediate rejection of something I sent for a special project; true, two of those poems were already published, so does it even count? And does it count as one rejection, or three, since I sent 3 poems? I can tell that math challenge might get the better of me here.As of September 1, I have sent out 5 separate packets, a total of 18 poems, and, have had one rejection. Mostly, I'm waiting 4-8 weeks or 3-6 months to hear on these, as on the many others still out there in the world.Also since September 1, the summer Sow's Ear Poetry Review has arrived, with me in it, along with Traci Brimhall, Ellen Bass, and many other wonderful writers and artists, and I have proofread (I hope correctly) the electronic version of a poem for Confrontation. Where there are meticulous editors!I am no longer even a weensy bit cranky, and I am just as grateful and enthusiastic as I was at the start about The Angry Grammarian!"},

Today, I refer you to Art as a Labor of Love, by me, with art by Aurelio Madrid, also at EIL, where, of course, I work for free. Please let us know what wonderful ways the arts community is giving back to you.Lest you think all I do is moan and groan and visualize ideal jobs emerging from slightly erotic seedpods, I want to assure you that I am actively looking for real jobs and actually applied for four fine jobs this summer for which I was well-qualified, except maybe by strict online keyword standards if your application is being graded by a machine.Clearly, I did not get them. I had a fabulous interview for one, but it went to an internal candidate, as so many ideal jobs do. I had even asked about that possibility during the interview, so I had a heads-up. It would have been “ideal” in being part-time and allowing me to pursue my artsy fartsy interests on the side and on the job, but less than ideal if internals wanted it to go to someone else. Which is often true, as is the fact that many jobs are merely posted for legal reasons but will go to previously determined very, very likely candidates.This is the current job market, and it stinks. But I am still somehow “furiously happy,” as The Bloggess puts it!For one thing, I still have my excellent job as Poetry Cheerleader, which does not require me to do the tiger jump.The right job will come my way, and I wish it would come my way the way it does in books. In the book I am currently reading, which shall remain nameless to avoid spoilers, all three sisters have been offered ideal jobs in passing during random conversations.Would you like to be a barista? Yes! How about a tenure-track teaching position where you always wanted to teach? You betcha! Oh, by the way, I’m taking a leave of absence. Even though you don’t have any experience or a degree in this, would you like my job as head librarian?OK, some of this is going to work out, and some of this is going to get complicated for all three characters, because that’s what happens in novels. But why don’t I ever get offered a job in passing during a random conversation?Oh. Yes. That’s how I got my last ideal job. Which I really did love and was grateful for.

I reside here and write poetry, and get paid.Or Generalist in Residence. (As I can also teach short fiction, literary editing, and acting, etc.)In this ideal position at a local college or university, I teach but am not required to attend department or committee meetings.  I am paid to teach workshop classes with no paper grading, and to set up readings and performance events for the students, inviting the town, and having lots of fun. The students would be traditional and nontraditional college students and members of the community who write, act, or whatever.  We would have a big event every year and invite The Bloggess as our guest speaker.

Right now, I wear jammies on into the day, forget to eat breakfast, and then, if I have to go beyond my back yard or my front stoop, put on an outfit I might wear off-and-on for the next week, until there’s some real reason to wash it.I did have a reason to wash my clothes after creating the homemade compost bin from a garbage can, and after climbing up a ladder into the lilac tree to pull down the seedpods of sweet autumn clematis, which resemble the lady parts of the Wicked Witch of the West and all her female progeny. I can’t even find images of these on the Internet, and I know why!Fear not, I am actually making a go of it with freelance work and visualizing labial seedpods opening to spread money into my eagerly cupped hands.  I am furiously happy to blog and write poems for free.

{"title": "4 Humors", "date": "Sunday, September 4, 2011", "text": "Happy Labor Day weekend. I am in a holiday humor, as Shakespeare would say. Specifically, as Rosalind would say in As You Like It.By coincidence, 1) I am (still) reading The Weird Sisters, by Eleanor Brown, in which a character, Rose, has been named for Rosalind, and 2) I have been looking into the four humours, or humors, as in the four main bodily fluids connected to personality types (now) and physical health (in ancient Greek and Roman times), dating back to the famous Dr. Hippocrates.Based on the looks of these guys, and the bodily fluids connected to them, I so do not want to be melancholic, but I probably am. And phlegmatic, too. Sigh....I am looking into the 4 humors again, a concept I encountered several times during my formal education, thanks to a wonderful essay assignment in my daughter's honors English course. Yes, they have to determine their main personality type using characteristics related to the four humors. I went to the school open house on September 1, so I know my daughter is supposed to read her draft aloud to me this weekend! Yay! And her retired English teacher grandmother will be here to listen, too!Reading aloud is such a great composition and revision strategy!We did some \"prewriting\" together, by way of a conversation about how she perceives herself--easygoing, responsive--and how I perceive her: those two, yes, and sociable. She is clearly of a sanguine humor--the happy guy under the phlegmatically happy guy.So her main bodily fluid is the blood, a good fluid to have. Mine is black bile (ew!), for melancholy, or phlegm. Really, who wants to be ruled primarily by black bile and phlegm.I am OK with being associated with water and earth, though, among the 4 elements. Annoyingly, in the course of this wikipedish 4-humors research, I ran into the Enneagram again, and took the test, the long version and the quickie comparison version, and I am an annoying mix, as usual, of all the things I do and don't want to be. (Sorry, Enneagram Institute. You are cool, I am not.) First encountered this as entertainment with group of friends--fun discussion, etc. At least I am a consistent mix of personality types in the 1-4 range: Reformer, Helper, Achiever, Individualist. But no one clear thing. That riles my black bile. That brings my phlegm nowhere near boiling point."},

(It's at About.com, after a little commercial.)  The woman telling us how is Danielle Lessovitz, and she makes it look so easy!  It is so easy. I now have a home made compost bin sitting in the sandbox under the old tree house, \"cooking\" up some compost from old leaves (stuffed by squirrels into an old Dogloo), fresh grass clippings, fruit & veggie peels, coffee grounds, and some newsprint torn into strips.My variation on the video instructions is to use (or have your handyman husband use) an electric drill to poke the holes because 1) individual nail hammering would take two days and 2) my particular kind of plastic had too much give to take the nail.Also, my can is not round, and I can't roll it, so I have to stir it now and then.  Have stick, will stir.In future years, gradually, I hope to build a little wall of flowers and blooming vines around the old treehouse to mask this compost bin. Wish me luck with that. In the meantime, it's still fairly unobtrusive behind a mature sweetgum tree, and masked from the neighbors by their big pine. I realize I could turn the treehouse frame into a grape arbor if I were really ambitious.But I am not really ambitious. Also, I can't really plant morning glory there, or let the sweet autumn clematis take over, tempting and aromatic as the latter would be, because electrical lines hang too near, and the power company would not be happy with me. But wait! I've just imagined the tree trimmers for the power company coming, finding the vine, an incident involving electrocution on a metal ladder, and **Zap!** a new superhero: Sweet Clematis Man!That's it for Slattern Day!"},

We are plagued by what I call \"provincial driving\" where I live, people who are following their own local routines, living in the center of their own little world, driving down the center of the road, even a road divided into lanes.My husband is known for his laid-back nature and the thing we call \"Cuban time,\" which does not require getting anywhere fast or strictly on time (although he has been cured of this by me when it comes to theatre and sports events, work, poetry readings, doctor and dentist appointments, movies, and stuff involving other people and their feelings), but  even he grows impatient and testy driving behind someone who will not choose a lane.I stay in my lane and signal all lane changes, as it's the law, it's polite, and it's much safer to let other drivers know your intentions, right? Unless you are a self-absorbed, provincial driver who doesn't want anyone to know you are just about to turn (left or right) in case you speed up to pass him before he does, which this same driver might do as soon as I signal my intentions.This is a life lesson for me that I never quite learn. Do not signal your intentions. Someone will take advantage of the situation to speed up and endanger you and everyone around you.  Am I overreacting here?Anyhoo, the other side of this...road...is that provincial drivers who are better drivers than I am are alert to the selfish and even the spaced-out habits of other local drivers. And might I just mention that it is not good to be driving while writing a novel in your head, or vice versa, as I learned the other morning while driving 30 mph through a firmly red light after dropping my daughter off at school.OMG, I'm a provincial driver. And, worse, a creative type trapped in a car and a routine that lulls me into thinking I'm safe and can be thinking of other things while driving.  Life lesson, life lesson, life lesson. Learn it! Anyhoo, no drivers or pedestrians were harmed while revving up the engine for this blog entry. Thank you, provincial drivers everywhere.Eventually, though, please choose a lane."},

The new moon for the new month was a little earlier this week, and September begins with a waxing crescent!I did write and send out 31 short poems on postcards, one a day for August, though I started a little early, as recommended, in late July, working around a week in Michigan. Postcards were surprisingly hard to find, compared to their abundance in my youth, on traveling vacations, but I got a bunch of art & photography postcards all at once at The Garlic Press, a kitchen and gift shop in my town.As suggested, I did write about place and in response to the card's image, but this always mixed with whatever was going on right in front of me.  So \"place\" often turned into my back yard, its gardens, along with the postcard image, and sometimes also my reading.  For instance, here is \"Omnivore,\" clearly influenced by The Omnivore's Dilemma, by Michael Pollan, and also in response to William Eggleston's color photograph of a man in Memphis, TN eating a fast-food hamburger circa 1965-68.

(I \"learned\" that I still remembered this...was also Lady Macduff in the same production.)]4.  This book is set in Ohio, where I lived for a time.5.  I cannot escape corn; from pages 33-34:Summer, however, is different, because in the midst of all these farms, there are roadside stands, fertile with the bounty of the season in Ohio: crisp, sweet, Silver Queen corn; perfectly ripe, yielding tomatoes the size of baseballs; delicately flavored cucumbers with satisfyingly watery flesh; strawberries, blackberries, peaches--a dizzying array of colors, lush with juice.  Often, in summer, this is all we eat, a table laden with fruits and vegetables, and Rose saw as she entered the kitchen that this was the case that night. Fortunate, as this also meant dinner would be ready before the crickets came out in earnest.6.  I am not alone as a haphazard cook, preferring a raw-fruits-and-veggies meal whenever possible. (But the Weird Sisters' mom walks away from the stove and forgets what she's cooking sometimes, and I am guilty of that.)7.  I am not sure about Eleanor Brown's use of \"fertile\" above, but she's using a community voice of sorts, the voice of all three \"weird sisters,\" so maybe it's OK. Likewise, \"dizzying array,\" which is a readymade phrase. But a narrator, even a community voice narrator, does have to talk the way people talk.Thanks again to Jonathan Koch for fabulous fruit art!

{"title": "All Flesh is Grass", "date": "Saturday, August 27, 2011", "text": "Yesterday I mentioned coming across the phrase \"living downstream\" in the corn section of The Omnivore's Dilemma, by Michael Pollan, and noting the coincidence that it is the title of Sandra Steingraber's book on the relationship between the toxins we use in our industrious lives and our health. Her full title says it all: Living Downstream: An Ecologist's Personal Investigation of Cancer and the Environment.Like Pollan, Steingraber is a beautifully clear writer. Just as Pollan makes agribusiness clear to the layperson, Steingraber makes science clear to the non-scientist, for instance, in lively descriptions of benzene and atrazine. Both writers use anecdote and charming personal experience alongside hard evidence to make the issues clear and let their significance come home.There are other striking parallels as well. Steingraber quotes Isaiah 40:6--All flesh is grass--at the beginning of her chapter 7, \"Earth,\" and I've just finished Pollan's chapter 8, titled \"All Flesh is Grass\" at the beginning of his Part II: Pastoral: Grass.  Both writers refer to the importance of the Rodale Institute Farming Systems studies. And Steingraber elegantly sums up for my home state what Pollan detailed in his journey through industrial cornland--\"Central Illinois is the beginning of a human food chain that ends in meat and snack food.\" (Steingraber, in \"Earth\" chapter).In both books I read about natural nitrogen fixing in soil (legumes, lightning) and artificial nitrogen fixing, by way of fertilizer, the ingredients also leading, sadly, to meth labs in rural America. In Pollan I read about \"the shock of electrical lightning, which can break nitrogen bonds in the air, releasing a light rain of fertility.\"Steingraber puts it this way: \"Lightning, that mad scientist, also fixes atmospheric nitrogen, which rains fertility into the fields.\" And makes it personal: \"My cousin John considers himself a friend of lightning and looks for it in the night sky when storm fronts wake him from sleep.\"I'm reading the second edition of Living Downstream (2010), updated to include the latest statistics and scientific information, but I read the first edition (above) a couple years after it was first published in 1997. A documentary came out last year, too, timed to the book's release, and I saw it here in central Illinois, with Steingraber and family members and filmmaker present.I'm impressed once again, not only by Steingraber's clarity and mastery of the information, but also by her balance and her passion. She advocates a shift to organic farming (not, presumably, the \"Big Organic\" that Pollan sees as just more agribusiness) as a remedy for our public health and the farmer's plight but also clearly sees that farmers can't do this own their own. Like Pollan, she sees the complexity and near-inextricability of it all, and the difficulty of as well as the necessity for change.Steingraber's cousin John, the \"friend of lightning,\" is a farmer, a conventional farmer who uses chemicals, but not too many, as he has \"a lot of respect for weeds.\" In the \"Earth\" chapter, she rides along with John during a harvest, saying that this is usually discouraged--\"guests in the cab are distracting and can compromise safety\"--and I'm reminded of the day my neighbor Gus offered to take my fascinated two-year-old with him on the combine. I imagined my son about half a row down frightened by the deafening noise, suddenly screaming and scrambling to get out...and thanked him but declined.My \"corn-fed\" son, now 21."},

And this is indeed sweet corn we'll be eating in the street while listening to sweet blues. Pollan's opening section was on \"industrial\" corn, the agribusiness of corn, feed corn, field corn.Corn is a grass, but not the kind of grass cows naturally eat. They have to be taught to eat corn, and, in the feedlot, it comes in a trough in a mashed, fat-laced, liquidy form. (Eww.)I was sad when the calf Pollan was tracking had to leave his mother. Remember Dumbo?! Yes, even some feedlot-destined cattle get to spend the first year eating grass with their mothers. But then off they go to eat corn and antibiotics instead of grass. Antibiotics because they stand close together and on manure, which has a lot of bacteria in it.\"Hell,\" said Dr. Mel, the vet, \"if you gave them lots of grass and space, I'd be out of a job.\"At the end of the corn section, which lays out all the specific evidence, Pollan reminds us of the farmer's dilemma--having to grow more and more corn (or corn in rotation only with soybeans) just to get by, and that's on the big farms. The small farms already went under. \"Corn's triumph is the direct result of its overproduction, and that has been a disaster for the people who grow it.\"\"Growing corn and nothing but corn has also exacted a toll on the farmer's soil, the quality of the local water and the overall health of his community, the biodiversity of his landscape, and the health of all the creatures living on or downstream from it.\" That phrase, \"living downstream,\" made me look in the back of the book--index, notes, and sources--for Sandra Steingraber. Though I did not find her book Living Downstream there, Steingraber and Pollan must be fully aware of each other's work, as both are interested in health, ecology, and the environment, and in the we-are-what-we-eat (drink, and breathe) dilemma.I did find Ruth L. Ozeki's book My Year of Meats, which Pollan calls a \"[v]ery funny, well-researched novel about the U.S. meat industry.\" I agree.And I'm old enough to remember the \"Where's the beef?\" commercial.Where's the beef? In the feedlot, eating corn."},

She’s looking closely at fairy tales to see how they function, transformed, in her poetry, and how they always functioned, as cautionary tales often about coming-of-age experiences or handling life’s “dark undertones,” as she puts it.Or disillusionment, as I see it.There's an irony. Fairy tales as illusions that record our disillusionment, and then restore us. Yes? Restore our innocence? Make us whole after a terrible fracturing? The Grimm versions help make that clearer. Open your eyes. Do not go gentle into that weird forest….That’s how fairy tales often strike me—as something at once gory & useful, containing the awesome/awful truth that my innocence might be shattered and nothing can help me but magic…or wit and grit. Plus courage in the face of the worst. “Don’t give up,” I learn and relearn from fairy tales…In this poem, first published in Ekphrasis, I look at a painting titled The Fairy Tale, and imagine the mother telling her daughter a fairy tale, side by side with an autobiographical moment of closeness with my own mother, who left a drunken party (to which wives & children were invited) in mixed patience and disgust.The Fairy Tale                                    William Merritt Chase, The Fairy Tale (1892)The woman and the girl are pink and white confections on the picnic cloth in the center of the grassy field.They wear their necessary layers, but the fabric is tissue thin,the parasol laid aside for the thrill of the story.It is safe here at the seaside, away from the men,to be so exposed,the girl’s face all raw color inside the white bonnet.And in the tale, the prince will hack away at thornsto offer the princess loveand a kingdom, even as she sleeps her long sleep.From this far awayboth painter and viewer can justify the blurbut I can see more clearlymy mother one summer day, walking away from the party, sitting at the base of a treeto wait for it to end.I use the “it” at the end here with an Emily Dickinson-like looseness and precision, to mean, of course, to wait for the party to end, but also the “fairy tale” of marriage and family life, the long sleep of women who believe in that fairy tale, and perhaps even the tree…for it will take a long, long time for that to end, won’t it?Alternate background music: “Hard to Be Soft,” by Paula Cole, on the Courage CDOr Peter Gabriel & Paula Cole singing “Don’t Give Up” here on youtube.  (Or, with Kate Bush on the So album, which has “Sledgehammer” on it, a song I played over and over, wildly dancing….)  Really, don’t give up!"},

That is, we know we have  a national obesity problem in the USA, but this chapter spells out for me the contribution of HFCS (high fructose corn syrup) as the thing piling sugars upon sugars in our consumption. Yes, I was aware of its danger and the bruhaha about it, but I was surprised to learn that humans only started eating it in 1980.  (I know from previous chapters--The Feedlot and The Processing Plant--that what we eat is also what the animals we eat..eat, so 1980 is apparently when it first went directly into our food products.) So this is a 30-year epidemic.But there was an earlier one! Corn whiskey! Earlier the corn surplus went into whiskey--we were drunken fools, and eventually this led to Prohibition. \"Corn whiskey, suddenly superabundant and cheap, became the drink of choice, and in 1820 the typical American was putting away half a pint of the stuff every day.\"The personal random coincidence is that today is my first rehearsal for the annual Discovery Walk at Evergreen Cemetery, and my character is Martha Rice, whose husband ran a store and got into a little trouble during the Civil War for offering to sell corn to Southerners.

I grew up in farmland, surrounded by the corn/beans rotation described here, and, of course, learned a lot about ecology and agriculture in school and in life while growing up.Speaking of school, I am glad there is a Young Reader's edition of this book!The particular copy I'm reading (of the grown-up edition) is a gift of my poet friend Bill, who is restoring the prairie on some land he owns around here in the midst of farmland.With the song \"The Farmer and the Cowman Should Be Friends\"*** running through your brain (handy link here, in case you want it as a ringtone), ponder this irony from The Omnivore's Dilemma:These two companies [Cargill and ADM] now guide corn's path at every step of the way: They provide the pesticide and fertilizer to the farmers; operate most of America's grain elevators...; broker and ship most of the exports; perform the wet and dry milling; feed the livestock and then slaughter the corn-fattened animals; distill the ethanol; and manufacture the high-fructose corn syrup and the numberless other fractions derived from number 2 field corn. Oh yes--and help write many of the rules that govern this whole game, for Cargill and ADM exert considerable influence over U.S. agricultural policies. More even than the farmers who receive the checks (and the political blame for cashing them), these companies are the true beneficiaries of the \"farm\" subsidies that keep the river of cheap corn flowing.

(Image, Dinner With Friends, Heartland Theatre.)I will actually be in a live performance in a local theatre this fall, Sirens, at Heartland, in early and mid-November, and a cellphone going off in the middle of it is, sadly, a real possibility. Hence, the elaborate fantasy.Here's what happened in my head:Mike, the artistic director, gave his usual pleasant curtain speech encouraging season tickets & volunteers, offering bottled water during intermission, and delivering the please-turn-off-your-cellphones request.Then I came out and said, \"Hi, I'm Kathleen Kirk, an actor in tonight's play, and I'd just like to ask you again to please turn off your cellphones. You may think your cellphone is off, or on mute, but it might not be, so please check. Also, I am technologically challenged, so even when I put my cellphone on mute, I might not have turned all the sound off, so if someone leaves a message, that little song starts singing later, and whoa! is that embarrassing! We wouldn't want that to happen to you, would we?\"I ask because, even though Mike asks every single night in his curtain speech, every single night someone's cellphone goes off during the performance. Really! No kidding! It's terribly distracting for the actors and the audience, and the people next to you will hate you and think you are stupid.\"You're not stupid, right? So, please, doublecheck, and turn your cellphone off, all the way off.\"If you are a super-important doctor-on-call, I'm not sure why you came to the theatre tonight, since you are on call, but, if you did, you can leave your cellphone on vibrate in the box office and, if there's an emergency and you have to go perform an appendectomy, the person in the box office will come out and stop the play and get you.\"I don't even want to mention texting.\"On a personal note, I could be at the state volleyball tournament tonight, watching my daughter play, but I made this commitment to my theatre colleagues in the spring and to you, tonight's audience, and, even though I am eager to hear about the game, I have turned off my cellphone so it doesn't ring or sing or buzz or vibrate backstage, causing any audible distraction for you, or physical disturbance to my fellow actors. \"Once I step out on this stage, in character, I am all yours and won't be thinking about volleyball at all. I will attend to that after the performance. But if a cellphone goes off tonight, while I am playing Rose in Sirens, it's possible I will have to step off the stage and out of character and escort you out of the theatre because of the disrespect to all...\"Cut to middle of play...cellphone goes off in the date-with-an-old-high-school-pal scene...Rose rummages around in her purse thinking it's hers, then listens, looks, and steps to the edge of the stage and off and up a little red-carpeted stair and rummages in the purse of an audience member and answers her phone:\"Hello? No, this Kathleen! I'm in a play right now, and you've called [expletive deleted] as she sat in this theatre audience watching the play.  ...I know! Pretty rude. So, I'm going to have to hang up now, and turn off this phone, and escort her out of the theatre. If it's really important, you'll call her back, right? Bye!\"Kathleen/Rose turns off the phone, fumbling a bit in her technology challenge, and looks around for a big man.\"OK, ma'am, I'm going to have security escort you out.  Security? Sir, could you be security for a moment, and escort this woman all the way to the front door?  Here, you can give her her cellphone when she's outside. We'll wait for you. We won't start the play again till you get back.\"Anybody else need to doublecheck your cellphones?\""},

Watch out for jellyfish!Back inside my braided brain, I detected a science strand, an art strand, and lots of drama and language.

Then, in the afternoon, I read about the red hibiscus in Clark's poem \"Tawny Light.\"  It begins:If I could be carried back to this, the just-before-dark            peach explosion of light touching the trees, and then                        the tips and serrated leaves on the wasteland chicory,if I could be lifted back to this before I die,…And then the poem is one long sentence, suspended, sustained, as is the sunset, but inevitably dropping into night. And in it is \"a red, tissue-thin shred / of hibiscus.\"Also the \"wasteland chicory\" I love, which is blooming now beside cornfields and in median strips in my town, and Queen Anne's lace. Fat Tuesday:Not so random, since RHINO sent me the book, in a box with others, \"Tawny Light\" was first published in RHINO 2009 (where I was an editor, reviewer, and advisor in the past). Yesterday, I opened the box again, and it was like Christmas! And that is the paradox of...Slattern Day:I'm behind on my attention to these books because I cleaned up! That is, to protect and keep them safe, I stacked them neatly in a box in my closet and got distracted by my life, other tasks and duties and reading. If I had, in a more slatternly fashion, left them to collect dust in a stack on the floor, I would have read this book sooner. But, given the synchronicity of chicory, lace, and red hibiscus, this was the perfect time.But I do want to keep reading and reviewing or drawing attention to RHINO poets and their books, as the magazine used to have a review section at the rear, RHINO Reads, now a reading series in Evanston. You can follow news and events in RHINO's Big Horn Blog.Poetry Someday:See above! But also, for poets, remember that RHINO has been reading submissions since April 1, and their reading period ends October 1.

{"title": "Back to the Drawing Board", "date": "Saturday, August 13, 2011", "text": "I love the short animated films by RSAnimate with the cartoon drawings, words, and narration. They make things so clear! And, of course, appeal to all kinds of learners--verbal, visual, aural--and various attention spans. Here is a good one on education (via Youtube) that describes the current context/situation and handles the tough realities with humor. While I know we must educate ourselves for the workforce and our economic times, I'm also troubled that education is primarily seen and only changed to suit political/economic needs of those in power.I always go back to Sputnik for an example, because 1) it works and 2) it corresponds to my own life span. Science and technology had to surge in 1957 so the USA could compete with Russia in the space program and the military-industrial complex, as it is called.We need another such surge now to stay competitive in the changing world and because of our own complacent habits, but two political/economic realities seem in irreconcilable conflict here: 1) Improve education from the young ages on up so we can have a strong country and 2) Keep Americans stupid consumers so the rich can keep their hold on most of the wealth.Sounds cynical, but of course the \"bread and circuses\" aspect of the USA today has been a topic of discussion for some time.I favor a liberal education strong on the humanities to balance an equally strong commitment to science and technology in our schools today, at all levels. We have to keep the whole human being in mind and know what's at stake.I've talked to too many students who went to college to get a good job. How did they define \"a good job\"?  Good salary, good benefits, lots of vacation time. \"And what would you be doing?\"No answer.If it's all about the lifestyle--the job = the money to enjoy leisure activities + nice house--then what are we doing to contribute back to the community*? And to keep ourselves feeling productive and happy with what we do?*feel-good charitiesBelieve me, I have not solved this for myself, and I'm no expert on this, but I can see the dilemma."},

I love it when the people speak, and it's interesting to see both sides claiming victory because, when we let real democracy work, we all win...or lose...together.When we rig the system, only the powerful win, right?Wisconsin's non-violent people's protests earlier led quietly and gradually to the great victory of having recall elections, a fairly rare thing and an accomplishment in itself.In sad contrast, we have London burning. Perspective on that is yet to come. I've heard commentators call it pure criminal violence, a seething social unrest from ongoing poverty and injustice, a response to a recent shooting, and so on. It's probably a subtle, complicated mix of all this.I think of Martin Luther King, Jr. alongside Spike Lee's film Do the Right Thing reminding us that if we don't \"do the right thing\" while the protests are non-violent they will become violent. And I am optimistic enough to think that we basically know how to \"do the right thing\" before it comes to that, and what the \"right thing\" is. We know when we are doing wrong, don't we?Well, I've gone philosophical and universal, but to keep it to the United States, here is Part 1 of the Right Hand Pointing United States of America issue, and the editor's Note on disillusionment and the reawakening to beauty.

{"title": "Dolores Oh! Oh! Oh!", "date": "Friday, August 5, 2011", "text": "Just when I think I might have to set Cordwainer Smith aside, he amazes me again with the complexity of his thinking. I refer now to his story \"Golden the Ship Was--Oh! Oh! Oh!\" which sets a real mystery into motion with a scarecrow ship described as a \"golden bubble.\" [This golden bubble spaceship image is from the film The Fountain.]All the rest was a golden bubble of the feinting ship, nothing more than thin and incredibly rigid foam with tiny wires cast across it so as to give the illusion of a hard metal and strong defenses.Sounds like various made up financial products that have led to various real economic crises. Sigh.What almost made me set the book aside forever was the story \"The Crime and the Glory of Commander Suzdal\" in which the commander listens to the \"siren song\" distress signal of a planet where Femininity became carcinogenetic. And it just got worse from there.But the story begins with the warning, Do not read this story; turn the page quickly, etc--and once more I am reminded of Flannery O'Connor who advises no suspense, in essence to know what you are getting into so you can watch how the people behave--and the story did upset me, as promised, the warning serving as its own suspense tactic and inducing close observation of how the characters behaved.So I read the \"Oh! Oh! Oh!\" story, a very short one, all the more closely, coming upon marvelous irony and paradox, and an admiration for a writer/foreign affairs expert who could say this about some full-of-themselves-bribed-and-foppish-world-leaders: \"With the launching of the attack, Earth itself changed. Corrupt rascals became what they were in title: the leaders and the defenders of mankind.\" Ha! Transformation was possible, after years of self-satisfied corruption!Furthermore, even the most foppish among them discovered he was longer addicted to an electrical current stuck into his brain, delivering pleasurable illusions: \"The contemplation of the golden ship and of what he had accomplished--alone, deceptive, without the praise of all the worlds for his solitary daring--gave even greater pleasure than that of the electric current.\" Now \"deceptive\" still gives me pause, and the knowledge that he was flying a scarecrow ship, but finding an inner peace from an unannounced accomplishment, that interests me.So does Dolores Oh, the character in \"The Burning of the Brain\" who seems so maligned for giving up her beauty and allowing herself to grow old:Wife to the Go-Captain was Dolores Oh. The name was Japonical, from some notion of the ancient days. Dolores Oh had been once beautiful, so beautiful that she took men's breath away, made wise men into fools, made young men into nightmares of lust and yearning. Wherever she went men had quarreled and fought over her.[I pause to point out that while the narrator appears to blame Dolores Oh for her beauty here, and for what men do because of it, I have a feeling that the men are to be held responsible for their own actions..., yes? Also spoiler alert.]But Dolores Oh was proud beyond all common limits of pride. She refused to go through the ordinary rejuvenescence. A terrible yearning a hundred or so years back must have come over her. Perhaps she said to herself, before that hope and terror which a mirror in a quiet room becomes to anyone:\"Surely I am me. There must be a me more than the beauty of my face, there must be a something other than the delicacy of skin and the accidental lines of my jaw and my cheekbone.\"What have men loved if it wasn't me? Can I ever find out who I am or what I am if I don't let beauty perish and live on in whatever flesh age gives me?\"Yes, here the narrator accuses her of pride and vanity, and yet isn't she asking a just and pertinent question? Isn't she pointing out the male gaze, etc.? Isn't she exposing a flaw in her own culture, dependent on a santaclara drug (stroon) that fends off aging, as well as one in our own that leads to a valuing of surface beauty and all kinds of plastic surgery for the preservation of that? Isn't she asking a real question about real identity, and also exposing a true human vulnerability?Later in the story, she's seen as grasping and insecure and dragging down her loyal Go-Captain husband, but (and here's the spoiler) then another amazing Cordwainer Smith transformation/complexity thing happens:Magno Taliano [his brain burned out by heroic action] had risen from the chair and was being led from the room by his wife and consort, Dolores Oh. He had the amiable smile of an idiot, and his face for the first time in more than a hundred years trembled with shy and silly love.I can't help it: I think the \"shy and silly love\" is a good thing. In addition, he'll be succeeded now by a young and brilliant female Go-Captain, so the anti-feminism implied elsewhere is undone. Paradoxically.OK, if you have stayed with me this long, please go and see this, a short piece at Her Circle about the 15th anniversary edition of Backlash: The Undeclared War Against American Women, by Susan Faludi, and the \"new feminism.\" (It also refers us to an article in Harper's.) Mull it over for yourself.Also, that fine old lady is the writer Mary McCarthy, who, like Dolores Oh, did grow old."},

Hot\"to see if the barista cracks a smile                                                       or not.--by Sarah ReckYes, there is a poem by me in this, and poems by many other poet/Star Trek fans, including Susan Slaviero of Cyborgia!As almost every day of my life now is a synchronicity jam or a Random Coinciday, I have to mention that in the waiting room this morning (ultrasound, nothing to do with pregnancy) I picked up a copy of Time (Future of Fish cover) with an article about fan fiction in it, and, of course, there was plenty about Star Trek (all generations).I wanted to be sure and celebrate Make It So... here, especially after complaining a bit lately about science fiction writer Cordwainer Smith and his odd anti-feminism. But geeze, he comes down hard on his character Dolores Oh in \"The Burning of the Brain.\" On the other hand, the whole story might be a criticism of a certain state of mind and culture, as these stories span thousands and thousands of imagined years. So, more on that tomorrow, perhaps."},

Fondly known as \"Star Boy\" now in my strange, shiny mind.Meanwhile, as I continue to read the science fiction of Cordwainer Smith, I am rediscovering why I sometimes don't like science fiction. Perhaps I will discuss some of this in an entry to be titled, \"Oh, my God, cats again?!\" noting the science fiction writer's terrible prescience.But, really, could he have predicted Hello Kitty? Could he have predicted the relentless cat humor all over the Internet?OK, it appears that this will be my anti-cat rant, after all, after reading \"The Game of Rat and Dragon,\" a Cordwainer Smith story that ends with a space hero upset with a nurse who is upset with him for favoring cats--that is, telepathic pin-lighting cats better known as \"partners\"--over humans. Underhill, the human hero, has read the nurse's mind briefly, but then:He cut off the sight of her mind and, as he buried his face in the pillow, he caught an image of the Lady May [his space partner, a cat].\"She is a cat,\" he thought.  \"That's all she is--a cat!\"But that was not how his mind saw her--quick beyond all dreams of speed, sharp, clever, unbelievably graceful, beautiful, wordless and undemanding.Where would he ever find a woman who could compare with her?OK, there you have it. It's a cute story, with appropriate concern for animal welfare and cats-in-space, etc., etc, and I love cats, my friends' cats, the bookstore cat, etc., but, come on, \"wordless and undemanding\"?! As you can see, I am not wordless and undemanding myself.But, to get back to discovering the stars, I'd also like to send you to \"Old Icarus,\" a poem by Colin Pope, up now at Linebreak.Lots to mull over there, eh?"},

So today, Fat Tuesday in the blog, I will toss some of them into my little Parisian net grocery bag (that I just made up in my head, to take along on that roller skating vacation under the Eiffel Tower).Personal joy: 2 poems in the new \"Lucky #13\" issue of Soundzine!Shared abundance: all those cool places that offer audio and/or video with poetry, or a wacky & wonderful conglomeration of varied stuff: Whale Sound, Via Negativa, The Nervous Breakdown, The Rumpus. And, of course, Escape Into Life!*I love these wild & generous collaborations.*See this t-shirt? I now have one! So do my husband, daughter, and son! We all got to attend an Escape Into Life party on Saturday night, and a sweet celebration of Chris Al-Aswad, founder, and his sister, Mandy, who has taken on the adventure, and we got to meet their father and other family members and friends. A lovely time, and fireworks on Lake Michigan!So...while I was swimming...but wait! While we were in Chicago, we saw the gigantic statue of Marilyn Monroe that just went up (like her skirt). Here are some pics, at the blog of Coffee Lovin' Mom! (Plain white panties underneath.)  Her pics were posted the same day we were standing there looking up at Marilyn. Hmm, so now it's also a Random Coinciday in the blog.Anyhoo, while I was swimming...I was comparing Cordwainer Smith, science fiction writer, with Flannery O'Connor, literary (Southern Gothic?) fiction writer, in terms of a moral worldview and the ability to enjoy the work in multiple ways, and also in terms of complexity, but most of that is now lost in the chlorine.But I still remember my husband climbing up and down fallen trees in the Michigan woods to get off or back onto the beaten path...and the splendor in the grass."},
{"title": "Helen America", "date": "Monday, August 1, 2011", "text": "I'm just back from a week on the beach in Michigan, where I finished a book of Cordwainer Smith stories--The Instrumentality of Mankind, edited by Frederik Pohl--and started another--The Best of Cordwainer Smith, edited by J. J. Pierce.These two paperbacks were tucked into the wonderful box of Philip K. Dick books sent by college friend Doug Robillard! I read two of the Dick books earlier this summer with a vague feeling of having read them before, and the same thing happened with Cordwainer Smith, along with the feeling that I understood and appreciated these stories much more the second time around. For one thing, I read the introductions, which told me that Cordwainer Smith was the pseudonym of Paul Linebarger, a multilingual scholar and expert on Asiatic politics, foreign affairs, and psychological warfare, and a consultant on numerous small wars, but not Vietnam, as he thought it was a mistake for the USA to be involved in that one. So this time around, I read not just for plot and character, as I must have done as an adolescent, but for his human insights and worldview.I was wowed.And moved all over again by \"The Lady Who Sailed The Soul,\" the story of Helen America, \"girl\" sailor. You can read it online here, if you want.The \"wow\" factor went warp speed a few minutes ago when I logged onto Facebook and saw one of those status updates inviting me to turn to page 56 of the book nearest at hand and put the 5th sentence up as part of my own status update. Also, the \"whoa!\" factor. Page 56 is what I wanted to quote from today, the 6th & 7th sentences! And then the 8th.Helen America had a tough life, but as she is getting ready to sail The Soul into space, she is advised to avoid drama. \"Tragedy is not the hard part. The hard part is when you don't quite succeed and you have to keep on fighting.\" That struck me as deeply true. And then this:  \"When you must keep going on and on and on in the face of really hopeless odds, of real temptations to despair.\"How many humans, in all kinds of lives, past, present, and future, can identify with that?!There's a specific science fiction space travel context for this advice to Helen, and particular kinds of physical and psychological pain she will encounter, but this lives very well outside that context, too. And that even parallels a plot aspect, one kind of travel--sailing--being superseded by another, easier, safer kind of space travel--planoforming.This particular story was a collaboration with the author's wife, Genevieve Linebarger, who also completed some of his stories after his death. Which also somehow ties right in."},

Ever since we gathered as a large family wamily 8 years ago, to celebrate my parents' 50th wedding anniversary, we've been re-gathering for a week in various locations, in recent years, Michigan.This year we were in a lake house in the woods with wooden steps down to a private beach, which meant that I sometimes went down in my jammies. Mostly in swimsuit & sunscreen, though.Great time talking, swimming, reading, sunning, drinking, floating, eating, drinking, boogie boarding...and just being together.Sympathique is the Pink Martini album that Sarah Jane likes. (You can buy it here or here! Or in vinyl here!)

On this one I hum along to “Clementine,” “Lilly” (dog or woman, that’s what I want to know!), and “The gardens of sampson & beasley.” I love this band for 1) China’s voice 2) wonderfully various instrumentals 3) charming tunes 4) lyrics in multiple languages and 5) Eugene.

Dick and 2) other stuff. And still writing. Also there will be a family wamily poetry reading + a big Escape Into Life party to celebrate the brief and shining life of founding editor Chris Al-Aswad.Meanwhile the big and little tomatoes are hanging on (as on the cover of this book by Terra Brockman, The Seasons on Henry’s Farm) or falling off and being eaten, sliced or in sandwiches, as in my folks’ garden.Possibly I will find recipes for 1) Filipino-style Chinese donuts and 2) pink martinis. If so, I will share them, so hang on!P.S.  I finished The Yiddish Policemen’s Union, by Michael Chabon, and read the glossary!

{"title": "Owls & Goals", "date": "Friday, July 22, 2011", "text": "The past couple of days, while swimming laps in the early morning, the water the same temperature as the air, I have been musing on small goals. Lately, the lap swim lanes at the pool have been crowded--no doubt partly because of the heat, but also, perhaps, because of small personal goals.People who planned to lap swim regularly but suddenly realized the summer is already slipping away. People who are participating in triathlons, now in training for the swimming part.Except for post-biopsy week and a couple travel days, I have been there every day the pool was open (that is, not on theft day and not when there was lightning). I realize I'm like those runners who run in all weathers! I've been there when the air was in the 60s, shivering when I got out, shivering on the ride home, but swimming anyway!I am steady and regular, swim at a constant pace, and this is basically how I live my life. It's like the patience and persistence with which I pursue poetry, or anything else.And it lacks small goals. So did my other \"careers.\" There weren't milestones, there weren't specific things I wanted to achieve. I just wanted, simply, to do what I love doing and make a living at it. Sigh....I stumbled upon some major achievements! Became part of the Steppenwolf Theatre's Second Company and  did mainstage shows there when I was a \"struggling actress\" as they say. Co-edited a literary magazine for a decade! And I'm glad of that. But none of this helped me \"make a living,\" as in support myself financially, at what I love doing. And I haven't been able to turn my head around, like a wise old owl (?), to any other way of looking at it.I still think my head's on straight, though. I'm OK in spirit. This is what I am, and I am still going along swimmingly.Three things have reinforced me in this, in wildly different ways, yesterday and today--making me laugh, wince, and nod in assent. Take a look at this wonderful article by David Graham on Emily Dickinson's \"barefoot rank,\" this funny poster on misery at Book of Kells, and this wonderful poem by Hannah Stephenson, called \"After After.\" Read the poem, and then click on the small title under the poem's title to see the image.

{"title": "Stealing Dust, Shining Lives", "date": "Wednesday, July 20, 2011", "text": "In the past few days I’ve read Stealing Dust, a book of poems by Karen J. Weyant, and These Shining Lives, a play by Melanie Marnich.  Both are about working people, factory life, and the families of people who work hard for a living, and both focus on working women.Stealing Dust is set in the steel and paper mills, factories, and coal mines of small town Pennsylvania. These Shining Lives are the lives of women working at the Radium Dial company in Ottawa, Illinois, who literally glowed, alas, and got sick from radium poisoning and cancer.I have seen Radium City, a documentary by Carole Langer, so I know that particular story is sad and gets worse.  The play by Melanie Marnich tells the truth in a creative-nonfiction-docudrama kind of way, and is poignant with an uplift connected to the bravery of women standing up to the company with a lawsuit.Weyant’s poems tell the truth about small town life, its joys and disappointments, yearnings and mistakes. And factory dust! While the canaries-in-the-mines are here, and open-eyed awareness of the ill effects of industrial pollution, I get the strong feeling that most of these people will make it through their hardworking lives, while the “radium girls” mostly did not.Radium girls used to put the paintbrush in their mouths to make it come to a fine point for painting the numbers on Westclox alarm clocks and wristwatches that would glow in the dark. Sometimes the radium girls painted their nails with this radioactive paint.In Stealing Dust, it’s useless to put on red lipstick (in “Makeup at Midnight”) because nobody cares, nobody notices. The men in the factory are concentrated on the machines, the quotas, the end of the shift. In “Beauty Tips from the Girls on 3rd Shift,” we learn that “Brillo pads will get rid of most of the dirt on your hands.”  And…Wear red polish. The color hides dark stains and dirt,especially grime that gets pushed back where hard nailmeets soft skin, that place a metal file can’t find.These Shining Lives specifies in the cast list that “everyone is in their mid- to late twenties,” because so many of the radium girls died young.  Ottawa is still troubled by radioactivity, affecting kids, grownups, pets, and wildlife.Stealing Dust concerns itself with mill towns people want to leave and livelihoods people must keep.  (The need to making a living is also what kept people in Ottawa, still working with radium-based paint when the plant re-opened as Luminous Processes.) “The Youngest Girl on 3rd Shift” is a naïve 18-year-old who has to work on “press number 69” and doesn’t get the sex joke. “The Oldest Woman on 3rd Shift” has arthritis in her hands “and her legs are bent, like a child with rickets,” but she “can still load three furnaces at once…[and] still flirts with Mike, / the head machinist, by stealing his cigarettes.”I praise works of literature like these that help me know about and care about the people, working hard, often in good faith, trying hard to make a living. Both Weyant and Marnich give us gritty truths about luminous women, and we always need this kind of wake up call.For new poems by Karen J. Weyant, see her feature up today at Escape Into Life! With images by Pennsylvania photographer Mark Cohen, who says his photos are “not easy pictures. But I guess that’s why they’re mine.”"},

That is, I spoke to the repairman and paid him, and learned about the leak, the new kind of (safer) \"freon\" in the pink canister, the kind that is less harmful to the ozone layer than the old Freon-12, and that fits our new energy-saving unit, and so on. I also baked him that lemon & chocolate cake and cupcakes, right before the heat wave, the one we are having now, with the \"feels like 110\" temps. This is the one week a year we will use the AC, so I had to get it going! He gave himself a new doorknob, having removed the existing one on the door between kitchen and garage, leaving a fine round hole, which actually worked better than the previous doorknob. This was a longstanding problem with cheap door & mickey mouse doorknob, exacerbated each summer by heat and humidity. Now it is fixed until the poor fit of the cheap door causes the next set of problems and/or until the fabulous husband finds the perfect new door at Menards.Meanwhile, my daughter continues her volleyball conditioning--summer weight lifting, running, etc.--after last night's league game in a hot warehouse. She's grown up so much since being afraid of everything except the air, the wild claim I made in this poem, first published in Drought, an online magazine that no longer exists.  Oddly enough, I wrote it before our house fire, and she did know where to meet, the big pine tree in front of the house, near the sidewalk.The Air My daughter is afraidof everythingexcept the air.At night she cannot sleepunless she clutchesmy fingers through the barsof her bed.  When the sirenwails its warningwe go downto the basement, bringblankets and zebraor the red velveteen bear.In kindergartenshe learns to crawl along the floorand reach up to feel if the doorknob is hot.She knows wherewe will meetwhen the house burns down,when there is nothing leftbut the air."},

It started with the palest of pink blooms, and now a Pepto-Bismal peppermint pink has also opened. Hot pink is next, still tightly curled in its buds, but soon to unfurl.This is a flower from Victorian gardens, from Emily Dickinson's garden. It is sensitive of seed pod, known as touch-me-not in some circles because the seeds will explode from the pod if touched. It is generous of frilly bloom. Its edges are like the ruffles on some lingerie sold in Victoria's Secret catalogs.You will want to read or listen to Billy Collins's poem \"Taking Off Emily Dickinson's Clothes,\" perhaps, on this Sunday morning.

It's a lovely book, primarily \"poems of place,\" as they say, mainly Springville, Utah, where the poet grew up, but also Nevada, where he lives now.I like the talking quality of these poems, as if the poem's voice is speaking directly to me, straight on, trusting me with his observations, interpretations, evaluations, and, yes, personal history. He names the girls of his past--Emily Jensen, drowned. Kathy Greene, Cindy Peterson.Here's the opening stanza of the opening poem, \"In Twilight\":I will go, walking down the dark canyon roadsoftened beneath a malleable sun.  Once more,one final descent into the valley of my home.I hear other voices, other men, poets, who have spoken to me this straightforwardly, in light or somber, measured tones.  William Butler Yeats--\"I will arise and go now...\"  Robert Frost, William Stafford.Here's a favorite stanza from a favorite poem, \"Dawn Psalm, Salt Flats\":A man might walk into the morninga thousand times and still not seethis same color or know the pleasureof learning its name.These poems of place also capture the community truths, as in \"Singing Back the River\"--\"With farmers / it's either too much rain or not enough\"--so the diction of the book as a whole can easily sustain the ready-phrase alongside a more personal lyricism--\"The past is a thief / escaping on the wings of blackbirds\" (from \"Nevada Wildlife.\")You can see more samples and excerpts at Justin Evans's page at Foothills Publishing and at his blog, One Man's Trash. Or read other readers' reactions in these blog posts by Sandy Longhorn and Kristin Berkey-Abbott. And Evans edits an online journal of poetry and place, Hobble Creek Review.If you really, really love towns, I have more for you!

One day he got a charley horse! \"What's a charley horse?\" I asked, and he tried to explain to me the injury that was a cramp in his hamstring.  \"What's a hamstring?\"Today, in the beautiful 74-degree cool perfect blue-sky summer day outdoors, I finished reading Fifty-Nine in '84: Old Hoss Radbourn, Barehanded Baseball, and the Greatest Season a Pitcher Ever Had, by Edward Achorn, who recently came to town and threw out the first pitch for a Cornbelters game.I so enjoyed this book and reading it during baseball season. Learning how the game was played in the 1880s, finding out about the scanty rules and equipment, and coming to admire the somewhat sullen and eccentric but dedicated baseball player known as \"Old Hoss\" who retired to Bloomington, Illinois and is buried here in Evergreen Cemetery.Achorn handles the history so well! Whatever is confirmed fact is confirmed in the book by stats, quotations, appendix, etc., and whatever is likely but not certain is gently acknowledged as such. And I like the way he handles baseball legends, as in the case of the \"charley horse.\"  Achorn in his Epilogue:As Old Hoss became a mythic figure, legends formed around his name. In 1907, an oft-told tale appeared in print about an incident during one of the famous Boston-Providence battles. Radbourn, running the bases, had sped around third when his leg cramped up and he had to limp home. Sandy Nava, \"a Spaniard, who spoke broken English,\" piped up: \"What's a malla you, Charley Hoss?\" That's how the term \"charley horse\" entered sports lingo, supposedly. Supposedly!You can get this book at Amazon, of course, and also in the gift shop of the McLean County Museum of History!"},

Not a piece was broken!I mention this because of yesterday's mention of a building collapse, which has had numerous follow-up stories in the newspaper, including this one about a glassblower being spared his life, if not his glass or equipment, because it was just too hot to work that day! Whew!Meanwhile, in water news, we were able to swim our laps this morning, in a calm pool, the area lawns and gardens also benefiting from a good soaking rain last night.

No laps for the not yet weary.So I came home and had cherries for breakfast, outside, before the return of abundant heat. In celebration, here is a new painting from Jonathan Koch, who allows me to illustrate my blog with his wonderful paintings. Go buy one here!Sometimes people collapse in the heat, but you don't expect a building to fall over. Yesterday, though, one did, in downtown Bloomington. A woman was trapped inside a neighboring building but rescued, and the Illinois Department of Transportation came in to inspect the bridge that also received some of the rubble. It's a comfort to know our twin cities have such good emergency and rescue operations in place, ready to go. Thanks to all who helped, and best wishes for full recovery for those injured and stressed by this unexpected event.Reminds me of when my kids fell over when small and, to help them not get too scared if they were clearly OK, I'd just say, \"Fell over!\" And we got back on our feet and on with our fun."},

As the interview cleverly put it, \"Watch this space.\"I watched a colorful rubber-band ball bounce toward me off my windowsill this morning when I finally came inside once a brief rain blew in--very brief, but the breeze was lovely. Then the rain stopped, and I went out to hose-shower the impatiens, columbine, violets, sweet william, and yellow poppy that had not got anything through the leaves of the trees and overhang of the roof......and watched this space on my front stoop fill with Magnolia: A Journal of Women's Literature, with my poem \"Lazy Heart\" in it! Yes, \"Lazy Heart\" is, in part, about the space program! And, more overtly, about civil rights and the walk from Selma to Birmingham.\"Lazy heart\" is a condition suffered by astronauts, and in the poem I also apply it to the bishop who advised people to stay home rather than join in the march, despite the plea from his fellow clergyman, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Amazingly, this was all happening at the same time, in a kind of Random Coinciday in our U.S. history.I am so moved that editor Gayle Brandeis quotes the end of my poem saying these lines could be \"the theme song\" of this collection. Wow! \"Mother Muriel would be so proud,\" she goes on, about the writers in this book. To be linked to Muriel Rukeyser is a real honor; she's the one who said, \"What would happen if one woman told the truth about her life?

(Small lap swimming world!)Swing dancing by the Infamous Backsteppers! A bagpipe band, the Prairie Thistle, in kilts and knee socks! An elephant! (Not a live one, a Republican one.)  Boy scouts, Cub scouts, and 4-H'ers!What a thrill.  And residents 90 and up were driven by in classic cars, so we got to wave to our neighbor Gus Ziebarth, local farmer, who is 94!There were horses and ponies in glitter shoes. They pooped in the road!Plus, Abraham and Mary Todd Lincoln waved to us from their horse-drawn carriage.I met a descendant of Dr. Silas Hubbard, who had donated oldtime medical instruments to the library, along with some medications made from herb, lead, and ergot in little tubes, the kind of thing that might have exacerbated President Lincoln's melancholy...so I hope he gave them a good talking to after the parade.I will head back this afternoon to see my mom in the cemetery. She'll be alive there, playing the role of Juliana Read Hubbard, wife of Dr. Hubbard, in the Hudson 175 Cemetery Walk.These Hubbards are indeed related to Elbert Hubbard of A Message to Garcia and the Roycroft Press.Instead of resting in between these historic events, I went to the Sugar Creek Arts Festival in beautiful Uptown Normal, and it's a beautiful hot, sunny, lovely day for that, too.  The arts festival continues tomorrow.  More info here.So...so far I haven't been much of a slattern on this Slattern Day in the blog!

Beautiful here, so I send good weather wishes along with my safe travel wishes to the astronauts and NASA.It's also a Random Coinciday in the blog, a day to pre-order Sex on the Moon, by Ben Mezrich, from Amazon. Ben Mezrich is the guy who wrote The Accidental Billionaires, on which the movie The Social Network is based.Hmm, maybe I should accidentally read that!Meanwhile, the Yiddish Policemen have landed at my house, for free, thanks to Amazon Prime, which I announce to my book group gals whose books I ordered.Sex on the Moon might be a little about sex on the moon, but it's mainly about stealing moon rocks and going to prison for it.NPR was covering the last space shuttle flight as I drove to and from lap swimming, and one fellow spoke about what we had hoped to learn from our space program, which he summed up as rather little. Then he spoke about what we might do next, mentioning space tourism, etc. Later, another guy, speaking of safety and rescue issues, explained that only 4 astronauts are going as only 4 can be safely brought back to earth after maybe hanging out at the space station for a while.All this 1) reminded me of the science fiction I have been reading lately, and in my youth 2) made me urgently sad all over again about the Challenger and other losses 3) gave me a lingering poignant feeling about the space program and its purposes.I recall the competitive aspect, to compete with Russia and Sputnik, and the military knowledge aspect, and the business aspect (jobs, money). But I also recall the awe, the desire for knowledge for what's out there! And how the science fiction of my youth truly captured that! I still want to know what's out there.In random coincidii mode:\"Sputnik is up there, I think--\", a poem by Richard Fox at Escape Into Life\"The Rocket Man\" by Ray Bradbury, in The Illustrated ManBackground music: \"Rocket Man\" by Elton John and \"Space Oddity\" by David BowieSometimes I swim in a lane by the pipe surging water into the pool, so when I am doing breast stroke toward the wall, I am suspended, going nowhere, till I break through that artificial current.I feel like a rocket man, lost in space...."},
{"title": "Swagger & Remorse", "date": "Thursday, July 7, 2011", "text": "I've been re-reading Swagger & Remorse, a book of poems by Richard Fox that I read a few weeks ago while preparing his poetry feature at Escape Into Life, up now with fabulous photographs by Katinka Matson (that are actual flowers reproduced by scanner!). This one is called Spiders.And pondering (sometimes while lap swimming) the phrase \"swagger & remorse,\" which has a terrible perfection to it.I hate \"swagger\" in myself and am uncomfortable around it in others, and so often, yes, it is accompanied by remorse. Or followed by it, often quickly, as in the shaking of salt & pepper onto one's food. Excerpt:Am having Coke & meatloaf:everything is too salty--there is such saltto make everythingtaste like something:does taste like something:tastes like salt[...]I remember some of the poems in this book from their appearance first in journals: \"Medusa/Superman\" in Court Green, \"There were multiple things we did in all the wrong order\" (a line that might describe my own life!) in Diagram, and \"Cinderella\" which we took when I was at RHINO, so I probably also recognize others from that particular submission, too.In fact, I wonder if that was a moment of \"swagger & remorse,\" as \"Cinderella\" is here titled by its first line, \"The dead shall know the dead by their shoes,\" as are many in this book, and sometimes, when there was disagreement in the group during our decision-by-committee process, we'd ask a poet to re-title a poem, etc. Well, it's done now, and no doubt Richard Fox has a way of accepting it, as in this (otherwise untitled) poem:If your house is on a hill, it's because someone decided it would be.If your body feels tense, then it is.You leaned for so long against your hall locker that your grade school principal said       You holding that wall upYou wanted to talk to me, but could not find the time;looked for the vanishing point & saw none.I am getting ready now to age.Everything is fearless in the wind.Thanks to you, I have never walked into the same room twice.This is a gorgeous book, melancholy, precise, and wise. It feels like a sustained elegy, and is indeed a book-length series of meditations and observations, some titled and some simply beginning. The table of contents is a poem in itself, therefore.I might quote anything from the book to show you its beauty and melancholy, but I will quote one last poem in  full, choosing it because I once wrote a poem to my son with the phrase \"Choose happiness\" in it, so this resonates in that personal way with me and, I hope, in a personal-that-is-universal way with you.So, another by Richard Fox, from Swagger & Remorse, a Tebot Bach book:Happiness is in the smallest hands.Where could you be when the air smells of boxwood;the new-mown lawn of watermelon.What could it be when sweat bands your shirtbefore clouds genuflect in front of the sun.What turns happily large & luminous, suffers the little onesto touch the skin of others,rises & falls in the happy atmosphere.Choose.You can't.You won't.You will."},
{"title": "A Maze of Daisies", "date": "Wednesday, July 6, 2011", "text": "I'm not giving up on Dick! Having just read UBIK, I'm now reading A Maze of Death, by Philip K. Dick, who seems like a really great guy. Though dead, and surely now really discovering what that's like.In A Maze of Death, people go as a small group to another planet--also part of the plot in UBIK--but now they are getting picked off one by one, as in a murder thriller.Will a detective arrive in a noser (small spaceship with only enough fuel for a one-way trip) to sort it all out?! Or is it all a metaphor for death? (That seems likely, given the title. Don't tell me, though!)In both books, it's important to stick together. People die when they go off by themselves....It's interesting to note the parallels and to discover Dick's obsessions. I see why people like him, and how these novels can turn out as really cool movies. I know (from Wikipedia) that a film version of UBIK is in the works! It's great that the age of special effects can handle Dick's ideas about perception and alternate versions of reality. What is reality?Answering a comment from Kim, I tried to clarify something about my preference for realistic fiction, as it's true I have complained before about 1) easy happy endings in feel-good or genre fiction and 2) fiction that is really disguised autobiography. She is reading Widow for One Year, by John Irving, in which characters discuss writing and particularly fiction based on real people and real events...I think science fiction writers, just like realistic fiction writers, might easily base characters on real people they've observed, or people similar to themselves or versions/aspects of self, or composite characters drawn from real life.Write what's at hand, so to speak.What I admire and desire, then, I guess, is the transcendence of self through art. That might sound uppity! I mean that I find it disappointing to learn that such and such a novel is a roman a clef, unless it was a really, really funny satire. If it's a personal vendetta, or an achingly sensitive self exposure, then, pfft! I still sound uppity. Well, pfft! on me then.Meanwhile, 1) my flowerbeds are a maze of Gloriosa daisies and 2) I am still reading the baseball book (but it's hardcover and signed, so not poolside or lakeside).

Big housecleaning plans fall through. Summer writing deadlines come up too fast, like road signs. I almost miss the turn! And so on.I almost titled this Summer on Speed, as I've begun the summer reading of Philip K. Dick, planned since a great boxful of books arrived from college friend Doug, and Dick apparently sometimes wrote on speed, or so says Wikipedia.I read Ubik with a faint feeling of familiarity, as if indeed I'd read it some previous summer. Since it folds back in time and suspends reality, I couldn't be sure and I couldn't remember what might happen next, but I expected to be left hanging...and was.That's often my reaction to metaphysical science fiction, a feeling of vague disappointment. You've got a good story going in a realm of utter fantasy, where you can make it all work out, Mr. Author. Why don't you? I know that's not quite fair. And I hate when it works out just to be parallel to an existing religion, usually Christianity.What seems to me to be the greater challenge, to read or to write, is realistic literary fiction. At least when things don't quite work out there, I am affirmed in my own experience of life, and might have picked up a few pointers on how or how not to cope with that. Again, I read to learn how to live. In this world, in this life.So that's my bias.Nonetheless, I am now reading A Maze of Death, also by Philip K. Dick, and will take the VALIS trilogy with me, to share, on a beach week later this summer. I think my dad might like Dick, too, especially this A Maze, where the Author's Foreword states, \"The theology in this novel is not an analog of any known religion. It stems from an attempt...to develop an abstract, logical system of religious thought, based on the arbitrary postulate that God exists.\"We'll see."},

{"title": "Gone With the Wind", "date": "Thursday, June 30, 2011", "text": "\"Good old-fashioned American sportsmanship seemed a thing of the past--in baseball as in business and politics.\" --Ed AchornYou could certainly say that today, but, wonderfully, it's a comment about baseball in 1884, soon after it became a professional sport.  It's from Fifty-nine in '84, the story of Hoss Radbourn, a \"barehanded baseball\" player in the days before gloves and helmets and few regulations when players were literally putting their lives in each other's sometimes broken hands day after day of play.Already the National Pastime in the 1860s, and as the country built itself back up after the Civil War, it was at first a joyful, fun, leisurely, healthy game played by whole towns--one early version was called \"town ball\"--and celebrated in poetry, notably by Walt Whitman!Once cut-throat competitive strategies and money moved in, the game got fast-paced and ruthless. A pitcher could throw the ball straight at the batter if he wanted. And did. Hoss Radbourn was hit in the chest the season before his titular season and unable to pitch for a time but got back in the game by grit and willpower.Sort of like Scarlett O-Hara! Gone With the Wind is 75 today.I heard this story on NPR this morning, on my way home from lap swimming in the glittering sandy-bottomed pool. (I took swimming lessons in this same pool and did \"water ballet,\" or synchronized swimming as it is called, olympically, today. Ah, those water ballet days are gone with the wind....)Susan Stamberg went to Atlanta to see where Margaret Mitchell wrote her novel, in a tiny ground-floor apartment, on a Remington, while laid up with an ankle injury.

Herons, a few fishing boats, no mosquitoes, plenty of wine and chocolate.I asked Susan about her preference for books with happy endings, and about how Anne Tyler fits into her reading pleasure, since things don't always lead to happy endings in her books. Susan likes Tyler because there is hope and authenticity in her stories, even if things do not always turn out the way a reader or a central character might wish.And that's what I want to ask you, too.  If you prefer happy endings, do the happy endings help you live your life? Aim toward a similar happy ending? Keep you optimistic and cheerful and goal-oriented?Or are happy-ending books an escape from the way life usually turns out, a sort of wish fulfillment?Pam mentioned Romeo and Juliet, just the kind of random coincidence I love, since I had just seen the play, saying she never wants to see/read that one, as the tragedy is so depressing. You know it's not going to work out for them, there's nothing you can do to prevent the disaster or help them out, so why sit through it?I was happy to sit through Part One of Romeo and Juliet at the Illinois Shakespeare Festival the other night, and see the delightful falling-in-love part, butterfly wings, and pink high-tops with glitter, plus a wonderfully traditional balcony scene, but I agree that Part Two (post intermission) was harder. Juliet suddenly grew up, the speeches lacked the glittering clarity of the first half, and death and doom were inevitable.Here, by the way, is Julie Kistler's review. And the traditional balcony scene above is by Ford Maddox Brown. And here are Clare Danes and Leonardo DiCaprio.Anyhoo, I escape pointlessness by seeking out the other way of seeing it. If a happy ending is unlikely, where is the joy or hope or meaning in the moment at hand?Yes, the one he's kissing!And the question answers itself.***Moments later:Oh. Apparently I originated this movement. Postpointlessness. In 1988. I knew I had seen the term somewhere...."},

But, as he tells his grandson, who is coloring Noah's ark in a Bible coloring book, \"Noah didn't need to figure out directions, because the whole world was underwater and so it made no difference.\"While swimming laps this morning, my heart and mind were full of parent-child relationships. I recently saw Romeo and Juliet at the Illinois Shakespeare Festival, thanks to theatre reviewer Julie Kistler, and I look forward to her review!We chatted a bit about how the play gets presented to high school readers--sometimes stressing the rashness of youth (hasty young love!), sometimes the rashness of parents (Juliet's father's cruelty), sometimes the \"star-cross'd lovers\" aspect, sometimes the folly of blood feuds.Seeing Juliet and Lord Capulet, we were naturally reminded of Cordelia and King Lear, the one who said, \"How sharper than a serpent's tooth it is to have a thankless child\" as part of a longer, bitter curse. Sigh...All I will say is that we have been very lucky in our children and have navigated the teen years with them without much upset, but that I am looking forward to a placid pontoon ride tonight on Lake Bloomington, with or without a compass!"},

{"title": "A Sense of Community", "date": "Saturday, June 25, 2011", "text": "Tom Ashbrook, host of On Point, was so funny, wise, and inspiring.He spoke of his roots here in central Illinois, growing up with a real sense of community, 4-H, communal farmwork among rugged individualist farmers, and his feeling that church was a place you went where all those people loved you--how that gave him the feeling that wherever he went in the world he would be similarly embraced.And he was.He also saw the horrors of the world, while they were happening, and reported on them as a journalist, and had to step away for a time, when he thought maybe telling the world what's happening does not actually stop what's happening, that maybe history isn't a progressive journey toward a better world.This is surely an ongoing dilemma for many human beings. And journalists. But now he's back, interviewing people on all sorts of topics.Ashbrook is the kind of journalist raised on Walter Cronkite, with an assumption that objectivity is a good thing to strive for, that you should try to get the real story and all sides of the story, but that journalism must be self-aware and self-critical and not blind to its own flaws and biases. He also thinks the opinion-based \"news\" is a lot of crap, and that was refreshing to hear.There was also a great Swede joke, and general joshing about his dad and the phenomenal number of Presbyterians in the room.As this was an event sponsored by Senior Professionals at Illinois State University, and the first Charles W.

I was driving home from lunch with a friend yesterday, listening to the news on NPR just as the sirens went off in Minot, to tell people still near the waters to get out. The evacuation program was working well, and people have been through this before, so they know when it's time. After the destruction, \"Some people just walk away,\" the reporter said, as there is sometimes nothing to rebuild.In this CNN account, you'll see a call to help via the Red Cross.  And here in the Minot Daily News, at the bottom, you see the poignant cancellations of local events. At the top, the caption \"Hope and Despair,\" and a resident facing the truth, \"Unfortunately, it's all over.\"Meanwhile, the ABC video and text report details as well the flooding along the Missouri River further south, endangering two nuclear power plants. The \"catch-22\" that flood waters could knock out power on a power plant, stopping the cooling system.Soon we are to head that way to see family in Missouri and some coming from Omaha, also a danger zone, and I hope this annual get together can work out.

Kafka! She's learning to talk. I have no ideawhat she wants. I, the petit bourgeois familywho keeps her trapped.Like Kafka's writing, the scene is notabout struggling, but how people invent struggles,and is more joyful than it appears to me.I say, \"Honey, I love you.\"She says, \"Shampoo.\"See, aren't you laughing? This is a great book for pooh-poohing that advice to writers, \"Never write about your pets or children,\" because Chris Green does both beautifully. If you're a poet, you could read this book to find out how to do it well, without sentimentality.Indeed, I had one of my poetry students read \"The Night My Grandmother Dies I Watch a Documentary About Sharks\" to learn how to write about a grandmother's death without being sentimental. My own advice, based on this poem, was, \"Just write about what's happening,\" and, \"Read this,\" shoving my book at her. In that case, the book was The Sky Over Walgreens, also with Mayapple Press.There's a lot going on in both these books, and I hope you will seek them out at Mayapple, where other poems are provided as excerpts. Chris Green is a wonderful poet, and I love the blurb on the back of Epiphany School by E. Ethelbert Miller, that ends, \"This is the Green movement we've been waiting for.\""},

I will celebrate by reading Fifty-Nine in '84: Old Hoss Radbourn, Barehanded Baseball & The Greatest Season a Pitcher Ever Had, by Edward Achorn, in the back yard, and taking Julie Kistler to lunch!I have read excerpts from this fun book already and lots of articles on Old Hoss and various articles by Ed Achorn, so this is not my \"first pitch,\" but now I have my own signed copy of the book and can read it straight through from the beginning. A baseball book is perfect summer reading. Ed Achorn is a wonderful speaker. He was here in town because Charles Radbourn, a great pitcher for the Providence Grays in the days of \"barehanded\" baseball (yes, no glove--except, say, the swelling up of the catcher's hand!), grew up here, returned after his baseball career, and is buried here. The local history book club read this book together, and the history museum brought Ed here for their annual meeting & special event for members.After his talk, Ed threw out the first pitch for the Normal Cornbelters at The Corn Crib, against the Evansville Otters. Maybe he'll report on that, at his website or by commenting here, as I did not get to go to the game, just the talk. I think it was a \"Fireworks Friday,\" as I heard a lot of popping later.And Radbourn himself was quite a firecracker. He had true grit, as they say, pitching through the pain in his arm, and lots of professionalism, as the game was played in those days (1880s), but he eschewed celebrity and bristled against the petty tyranny of baseball owners in those days, who rigged players' contracts so they could be sold to another team, with no say in it, but not sign on with another team, ever.\"He may have worked as loyally as a horse, but he felt little if any devotion to his supposed masters, the men who paid his substantial salary. As far as Radbourn was concerned, the capitalists who ran professional baseball were grasping thieves bent on stealing what was rightfully his.\"Please note the flipping of the  bird on the book cover."},

I was thinking about \"garden poems\" recently, reading the guidelines of a magazine that doesn't want any, and what those editors might have meant by that, or assumed about \"garden poems,\" no doubt based on receiving a bunch of the kind they don't want. Would these be overly pretty poems? Poems only about the garden? Poems suitable for greeting cards?I've got to hope my own garden poem is not just about forget-me-nots (stanza 1), not just about me (stanza 2), but also about the world and its \"rough men\" with beautiful, delicate souls, and so on, and what we are to do here, with each other, and in the garden of the world (stanza 3).Of course, my poem, as a poem (a written artifact), must be a way of saying \"forget me not,\" with all the ironies attached to that. But isn't it also saying, \"Let's don't forget to pay attention to what's at hand, and let's don't forget to really see?\" Or is that just another \"fond belief\" of my own?On the other hand, left to themselves, forget-me-nots could easily take over the garden.

{"title": "Dream Work", "date": "Friday, June 10, 2011", "text": "Did I dream it was summer? Back to gray 50s, and bit of a blue mood. (Can it be a Blue Monday on an actual Friday? The answer is yes.)Yesterday I read Dream Work, poems by Mary Oliver, to get back a sense of the poet I had come to love in American Primitive and House of Light.  Her more recent book Thirst had left me thirsty.Dream Work starts with sort of a bad dream, \"Dogfish.\" A dogfish is a kind of shark, and though she sees it as a \"relaxed and beautiful thing,\" smiling, we know right away it is dangerous and that this is not a good smile.When she says she wants the past to go away, we can figure the dogfish must be like some awful predator in her own past. \"Slowly,\" and now a stanza break, white space, new stanza of a single line, \"the dogfish tore open the soft basins of water.\"Still, he is only tearing open the water itself. The little prey fish still have a chance:And look! look! look! I think those little fishbetter wake up and dash themselves awayfrom the hopeless future that isbulging toward them.[This reminds me a bit of the constant advice to potential victims of sexual predators on how to avoid them, and of the wonderful hard biting irony of the poster now circulating on Facebook, that redirects the advice to the predators themselves.]But Oliver's book is from 1986, and she is telling the fish, and readers, to get the hell out of there.  That is not a friendly dogfish, as in man's best friend; that smiling thing is a shark.She is telling herself, too, not to wish for the world to be any easier:And nobody gets out of it, having toswim through the fires to stay inthis world.And, about the fish, she shares a bit of encouragement:And probably,if they don't waste timelooking for an easier world,they can do it.So this is a thing I can take to heart and also smack myself on the head for, as I'm sure I have wasted some time looking for an easier world. But I did not consider it a waste of time to read the rest of this book in the shade of a tree, and, like Mary Oliver, I never consider it a waste of time to walk out in the beauty of the world, grateful and full of praise.And I hope it is not a waste of time to ponder, compare, and contrast poems about animals in this book with poems about animals in Thirst. Here, in Dream Work, Oliver seems to avoid the pathetic fallacy or any sentimental oversimplification about what an animal is thinking or doing.  In \"The Turtle,\" she goes there, describing the female getting ready to lay her eggs on the sand, but pulls herself back to the reality of instinct, saying \"you thinkof her patience, her fortitude,her determination to completewhat she was born to do--and then you realize a greater thing--she doesn't considerwhat she was born to do.She's only filledwith an old blind wish.It isn't even hers but came to herin the rain or the soft wind,which is a gate through which her life keeps walking.OK, it's true that it gets a little pretty after the \"old blind wish,\" but the speaker is understanding and connecting to the turtle, so she's got to see and walk through that gate herself. (And the turtle is not pretty; she's ungainly.) So, in \"The Turtle\" it's clear that the human speaker is the one doing the human feeling, which is different from claims made in Thirst that certain dogs adore flowers or sunsets, though I think that poem, \"Musical Notation: 1,\" might also simply be making a claim about what humans think about animals, just less artfully. I could be wrong.Likewise, in \"Milkweed,\" she does not really say milkweed plants were \"once young and delicate, also / frightened; also capable / of a certain amount of rough joy\" but instead says \"it's easy to believe\" that about milkweed, once you compare them, as she does, to \"a country of dry women.\"She ends the poem this characteristic way:I wish you would walk with me out into the world.I wish you could see what has to happen, howeach one crackles like a blessingover its thin children as they rush away.OK, I am going to walk out into the world now, even if it's only my own back yard. And bless my firstborn, off in the big city, rushing away into adulthood, 21 today!"},

Thor is shaking his hammer at me for that shirtless actor comment a while back. But the water felt great for the short time I was in it, and I got several laps in before the very responsible lifeguards whistled us out of the pool.So today I will use those four overripe bananas to make some more vegan banana bread, a recipe I now prefer to the one in Joy of Cooking. It uses maple syrup and apple cider vinegar and the bread stays very moist! Oops, I left the soy milk in my mom's fridge...but last time I used water, for lack of soy milk, anyway.Speaking of my mom, the poetry of Mary Oliver sometimes drives her crazy, er, bananas. All that wandering around in the beauty. My mom points out the need to mow and pull out weeds, the little maple trees growing in the rain gutters, etc. I read Thirst recently--can't recall when/how I obtained a copy. Seems new, not from Babbitt's, not from our dead friend Griff, but I don't remember buying it, and I gave up buying books for Lent and have not much resumed. Sort of a sustainable living choice, that.Thirst drove me back to American Primitive, House of Light, and Dream Work, for poems that weren't banging me over the head with goodness. This was a good thing to do. The human story before the huge beauty story is there, right away, in Dream Work. In \"Dogfish,\" in \"Trilliums,\" in \"Rage.\" In \"Dogfish,\" Mary Oliver says this, halfway through:You don't want to hear the storyof my life, and anywayI don't want to tell it, I want to listento the enormous waterfalls of the sun.But this is quite a dilemma. I do want to hear the story of her life, transformed as she offers it, yes, in poems, but I do want some version of the personal story, in the \"flickering\" of the dogfish down in the water, in the flash of \"the sun's fire\" on motionless stone (in \"Knife\"), in the terrible dark anti-optimism of \"The Shark,\" in which a shark is caught by fishermen, mauled in its own thrashing, and hauled home:And I say: in the wilderness of our witwe will all cry out last words--heave and spit theminto the shattering universe someday, to someone.Whoever He is, count on it: He won't answer.The inventor is like the hunter--eachin the crease and spasm of the thing about to be doneis lost in his work. All else is peripheral,remote, unfelt. The connections have broken.Consider the evening:the shark winched into the air; menlifting the last bloody hammers.And Him, somewhere, ponderously lifting another world,setting it free to spin, if it can,in a darkness you can't imagine."},

{"title": "The F Word", "date": "Saturday, June 4, 2011", "text": "The new issue of Granta is out: Granta 115: The F Word, and just in time to answer some Naipalling* comments from a male Nobel Prize winner. The \"F\" word in this case is Feminism, and we get a variety of views on it, and a historical overview, by writers who include A.S. Byatt, Francine Prose, Jeanette Winterson, Linda Gregerson, Louise Erdrich, and even Eurdora Welty, who is dead. Eudora Welty's contribution is a bold and hilarious letter of application to The New Yorker, from March 15, 1933. She offers to cover movies and art exhibits, saying she \"could review them with my old prosperous detachment, I think; in fact, I recently coined a general word for Matisse's pictures after seeing his latest at the Marie Harriman: concubineapple.\"So, in celebration of the F word and Slattern Day in the blog, I let other women speak by quoting them today. (Plus, a nod to Bill below.) I return for the moment to Carol Shields, in her novel Unless, an excerpt from her fictional letter to a reviewer in the Chicago Tribune, who is, as so many do, damning women writers in familiar ways:\"Women writers, you say, are the miniaturists of fiction, the embroiderers of fine 'feeling.' Rather than taking a broad canvas of society as Don DeLillo does, or Philip Roth, who interprets relationships through the 'lens of sexual yearning,' women writers as such--and here you list a number of female names including my own--find universal verities in 'small individual lives.' This, you go on to say, is a 'tricky proposition,' which only occasionally works.[She continues, and here I quote the section that parallels my education and its assumptions that writers recognize and honor the universal value of the particular human life]:\"...Way back in high school we learned that the major themes of literature were birth, love, understanding, work, loneliness, connection, and death. We believed that the readers of novels were themselves 'small individual lives,' and so were the writers. They did not suffer, as you intimate, from a lack of range in their subject matter. These lives apprehended the wide world in which they swam, and from their writers' chairs they thrummed to the tune of sexual longing, but their gaze was primarily on the locked-up consciousness of their individual, human, creaturely being and how each separate person makes sense of all that is benevolent or malicious.\"[I love this honoring of the effort of each separate person to make sense of it all! And then she makes a further, important philosophical and moral claim]:\"There weren't any rules about good and evil, and no Big Rule. It just seems that our species is happier when we are good. This is observable, though difficult to document.\"This last applies specifically and importantly to the theme of goodness in the novel, and also, of course, to the theme of goodness in human life, and I am struck by the phrase \"difficult to document\" and how it also applies to the physical and obvious pollution in our life, not only the moral \"pollution\" that is evil. In Living Downstream, Sandra Steingraber confronts this difficulty and slowness in science being able to track and document the effects of toxins in our air, soil, and water and their effects on our health.  They are indeed \"observable, though difficult to document,\" because people move away from cancer zones and businesses resist regulations and reporting, etc., etc. We know better. We know that putting toxins out there is likely to make us sick, give us cancer, etc. Each time a new alert comes out--cell phones may indeed be carcinogenic--there is much mockery at first, and people go on happily using the next modern convenience or happily eating the large, pretty fruit.Or smoking that calming, glamorous, trendy, cool, addictive cigarette. Until they get cancer, and look for someone to sue.We know better. We don't have to be this way.Hmm, it appears I am a slattern on a soapbox.*Thanks, Bill Harrison! But I had thought of that pun, too!

I really did wake up at 3:03 a.m. one morning in winter and sit up for a while in the front room, pulling the curtains closed so I wouldn't scare the paperboy, or paperwoman, as it might have been at that time. (Now I read the paper online, so I don't keep track of the delivery patterns in our neighborhood.)I really did have mini lights on the windows all year round at that point. Well, in fact, they are still there, or a different couple of strands, but they are multi-colored now, and one strand doesn't work, so I seldom turn them on--mostly just to guide someone to my house at night or to the light up the wine rack, around which a third strand is tangled.Those are details that have nothing to do with the poem. I hope the details that do matter are the ones in the poem that connect my personal experience to other people's personal, even intimate, experience of life and help illuminate it: vulnerability (naked or nearly naked), loneliness or a joyous solitude, concern for others (not waking, not frightening), noting the time (for the reason mentioned...and other reasons) and, for poets, the connection to \"Danse Russe,\" and all the layers of that, including his reference to a Kathleen!And the not Kathleen of my own poem's conclusion. No one's looking, no one cares, and that doesn't matter. Nothing to see here, carry on with your own lives!Poets and/or people who read poems aloud as a way to understand them will appreciate, in \"At the Window,\" how stanza two connects to stanza three in difficulty of saying these actual words. The physical difficulty of pronouncing \"Upstairs waits that wasps' nest\" leans into the emotional difficulty that comes next. And I hope many readers will understand what it might mean to \"lean away\" from expectations about housework, or women, or identity, or just the tasks of dusting windowsills with spiders and their wrapped prey on them, or removing wasps' nests, tasks shared by men and women. A woman might be expected to dust the windowsill; a man might be expected to remove the wasps' nest. But whatever expectation or \"pose\" might be captured here, it does not define us. We are more than one isolated view, yes? And who wants to sit in a \"birdcage throne,\" eh?Anyhoo, I hope you will read this whole issue, and think about this kind of thing in response to all the poems there, and look at and through all the window images gathered for you here by editors Rose Hunter, Sherry O'Keefe, and John Riley. They've done a wonderful job, and I've so enjoyed reading and gazing at these Windows!"},
{"title": "When It Rains...", "date": "Thursday, June 2, 2011", "text": "...it pours random coincidii. It is raining lightly here today, watering the lawn and flowers, not attacking with a tornado, as in Massachusetts, nor, so far, with thunder, though it is Thor's Day in the blog. My daughter, finished with finals, has plans to go swimming, but if there is even a glimmer of lightning, this will not be allowed, in fifteen minute increments, at the public pool.Today I finished Unless, by Carol Shields. It was urgent to do so, as I was wrapped up in the story and also in the sad, stark view of the persistence of inequality, silencing, and subjugation of women in the world today (in a novel set at the dawn of the 21st century), despite so many advances.Of women and of women writers.This was exacerbated--my sad urgency--by an article about VS Naipaul in the London Evening Standard, posted by Ren Powell on Facebook. Naipaul's comments about women writers strike me as appalling, tactless, and representative; his opinions are his own, of course, and from his own cultural standpoint, but are clearly shared by many. I leave you to it.What I hoped for in the book was some kind of generous, subtle, nonviolent triumph--some brilliant resolution of all the strands that was more than any neat tying up of loose ends, after the necessary tight knot and its unraveling. I got what I came for, and leave you to that, as well. I do recommend this mother-daughter story that has women and men in it, in all kinds of engaging ways.The blurbs on my green paperback include this: \"Lives may have cracked asunder, but wry comedy leavens the tale,\" from the New York Times Book Review. Very wry, I'd say, and not obviously comic. If this is not on that list of 250 books by women that men should read, it should be.And here's some wry and gentle comedy. We've just had some wonderful family-wamily time over the Memorial Day weekend, brother and sisters gathering with parents in the Midwest, teen/grown children mingling. My brother's family had seen Thor, the new movie. His wife and daughter shrugged, saying the film would have been better if Thor had taken off his shirt sooner and left it off longer. \"Why cast that actor if he's going to keep his shirt on?\" My brother enjoyed it thoroughly, reminding us that he used to buy and read the Thor comic books.So I'd say some things balance out in these areas. If women can be discussed as sex objects, so can men, and it can be done gently, with good humor.But for women to continue to be routinely dismissed as lesser, sentimental, weak, and so on, after all this time, whether as humans or as artists, no, I can't shrug that off.Vive le différence! as the saying goes, in comic and tolerant appreciation, but let's get rid of the inequality and constant judgments, please. No more salt in the wound."},

And with using books for interior decoration. I just didn't know it could be a \"sideline,\" an actual job!Oh, and of course there are distressed jeans, the really expensive ironic ones.Anyhoo, it's also the hump of the week in the blog...and the week...and this novel has also delighted me, as did Megan Snyder-Camp's poem about pretending the ceiling was the floor, with reminders about how we thought about the world as children.That is, she recreates the experience of a child lying underneath a peony bush, seeing the secret world of ants, and so on, and discovers that the moon follows her wherever she goes, and I remember these experiences, too.  The narrator learns that the moon also follows her friend Charlotte everywhere she goes, so she is alerted early that some private experience is actually shared, that the childhood world will turn out to be a different world in adulthood.What I'm saying is I'm glad to find this in a book, someone talking about that. And also the chance to re-experience it by reading it. It might also make me lie down under my mom's peony bush.Her peonies smell wonderful--that intense, nearly intoxicating sweetness. (I wouldn't be able to lie there too long). Yesterday I was wandering the gardening Internet, checking out the rumor/reasons that peonies don't have this wonderful scent anymore, that only \"antique peonies\" do. Some do, some don't--variety of possible reasons, including pollution, evolution/adaptation. As usual, some sources try to blame it on the person's nose, rather than whatever it really is, what conditions in the world or the particular variety of peony.While I can still smell, and while peonies still have scent, I am glad of June, June, June!"},

(I picked the right one, with buds not seedpods, and it is blooming now, that yellow poppy!)Lemon balm is in the mint family and spreads itself and comes back. We had some actual spearmint in the back yard last summer, good for iced tea or mint juleps or mojitos, but where is it? Alas, only the lemon balm has returned.A mojito is the Cuban highball. We like mojitos in our house due to specific and general attractions to 1) Cubans 2) James Bond movies 3) Halle Berry 4) lime and mint.Later in June, I'll probably tell you about day lilies taking over the world yard.After Memorial Day--love, family, remembrance--I am glad to enjoy this abundance of life after the rains, even if I pull some of it out.And then smell like lemon Pledge.Credits: Melissa officinalis (lemon balm)& Franz Eugen Koehler (public domain)And now today's wonderful random (reading) coincidence: After I pull up the lemon balm and smell like lemon polish, I read, in Unless, by Carol Shields, \"I won't even mention the swift, transitory reward of lemon spray wax.\" The kind of sentence that defies itself, in a passage about the common experience of comforting oneself with housework. (Or gardening.)And on the next page, the main character, a translator, tells the writer she is translating that she might want to use the word \"brain\" instead of the word \"heart,\" because \"heart\" is fey and passé and not-very-enlightened in a feminist way.\"But this is where I feel pain,\" says the writer. \"And tenderness.\"And that is what I must tell anyone who tells me not to use the word \"heart\" in a poem or that taking up gardening, and writing about it, is clichéd or risks sentimentality. So what? I take the risk.Even if I am writing in my own language. Not in a language of the heart, being translated, which generally allows the trendy American translator to say the old-fashioned, straight on, wonderful thing...and get away with it, because it was written by someone from another country.Oops, I sound a little bitter. Or bittersweet. But that's a plant of a different color."},

Bone Burnett's soundtrack to Cold MountainYesterday's reflection in church reminded me that Memorial Day had its origins in Decoration Day, a day set aside for remembrance of the dead after the Civil War, and that William Tecumseh Sherman was the General who said, \"War is hell.\"Wikipedia reminds me that the day was created and first celebrated by black Americans, particularly former slaves honoring the dead Union soldiers.After World War I, this day of remembrance in the United States began to extend to all Americans lost in war, and gradually it became a day to decorate the graves and remember all our dead.Susan Ryder's reflection begins with \"The Young Dead Soldiers,\" a poem by Archibald MacLeish, who was himself a veteran and also served the United States as Librarian of Congress and in the Secretary of State's office. Giving voice to the young dead soldiers, he says, \"We leave you our deaths. Give them meaning.\"Please read Susan's thoughtful piece, and be sure to click and read the article by Kevin Cullen, called \"The fatal touch of war,\" which makes you keep asking whether particular military and civilian deaths during wartime had meaning or were for nothing. It clearly demonstrates that war is hell.And I continue to be struck by what General Sherman said about the impulse to war: \"Suppress it!\"I woke this morning to bright sunshine and the joy that family will gather today for this Memorial Day holiday, but also with the phrase \"lost to me\" floating in my consciousness like the ethereal voice of Alison Krauss.I thank our veterans, whether they served in a \"good\" war or not.

I guess the song they were singing at nationals in New York (show choir competition) was 1) too loud and 2) in the same key as the sirens.I can gleefully report that damage was minimal around here, no injuries, and that the tree in rural Heyworth did not fall on the farmhouse!(But yesterday's Judy Garland singing \"Over the Rainbow\" just before the twister did fit the weather post-blog entry.)Everybody else around here went to their basements, I discovered later on Facebook.I should pause to say I did check on my family--was talking to folks on phone, who had come in from mowing before bad weather rolled back in, so I knew of the warning in the area. Called daughter, elsewhere with my car, to tell her to stay put, not travel if it was bad, OK to stay longer where she was, etc. Hubby had come home from his staff/student junior high volleyball game, gone out again for gyros, and returned safely, saying daughter shouldn't drive in it--\"I called her,\" I said.I should have noticed the funny, sly grin he was giving me as the Glee kids kept singing.Vanity Fair, a sort of glamor magazine with good articles, used to be my guilty pleasure. Now it's Glee, high school kids singing, silly plots, tortured romance, ridiculous grownups. Sue Sylvester, the cheerleading coach you love to hate. (I've played volleyball with her!) I cried when her sister died.Glee has plenty of redeeming social value. Gay kids get to love one another. Bullies are exposed, resisted, given a chance to change. Incompetence and school politics look as bad in Glee as they are in real life.But mostly it's unreal life--sudden singing with professional musicians and sound engineers and rolling cameras.Sometimes life is unreal in this way. I have a poem coming out in Sow's Ear this summer, called \"Mowing.\" It's got five white funnel clouds in it, hanging over the farmhouse I grew up in, doing no harm."},

We just watch the play, or read the story, caring about the people and what happens.In fact, I finished it outside yesterday, in sunshine, before the rain came rolling through overnight.There is only a glancing reference to Noah, the ark guy. Other Bible stories are mentioned, by way of a Bible coloring book. But here's a snippet of dialogue that demonstrates Tyler's humor, spot-on observations of real life, and ability to be deeply provocative in a subtle way that resonates later, or on re-reading:\"Louise, what's the meaning of the Joseph story?\"\"Which Joseph story?\"\"The coat of many colors, the slavery in Egypt--what are people supposed to learn from it?\"\"They're not supposed to learn anything,\" Louise said. \"It's an event that really happened. It's not made up; it's not designed for any calculated purpose.\"\"Oh,\" he said.(This is Louise's father asking, and deciding not to pursue the conversation further, after babysitting the boy with the Bible coloring book.) The sentence, \"They're not supposed to learn anything\" made me laugh out loud, in a choked-in-the-throat kind of way. That's exactly the problem, isn't it, with a literal and fundamentalist interpretation of the great stories from the Bible (or any religious text). The conversation stops.Progressives cannot talk to fundamentalists. Too often, atheists and agnostics assume anyone who goes to church or reads about religion must be a fundamentalist, or some kind of literalist. So the conversation halts there, too.Of course we are meant to learn something! Of course there are helpful and harmful \"calculated purposes,\" all around. Open your eyes! Etc., etc., laughing and choking.So I do like Ralph Waldo Emerson's idea that we can intuit what's out there, in terms of a spirituality, or a moral or political philosophy, from Nature. No one text or one spiritual or political leader has to teach it to us, or could. The conversation is ongoing, and scientists and historians and political philosophers and poets participate in it, too. And marvelously funny novelists."},

OK, I am just now getting around to it.1.  I am old enough to have watched the original To Tell the Truth on TV. (I hear in my head \"a Goodson-Todman production!\")  With Bud Collyer as host and, often, Kitty Carlisle as panelist.2.  I always think Kitty Carlisle was once Miss America. Am I confusing her with a panelist on another game show? Kitty Carlisle was married to Moss Hart.3. I played Alice in You Can't Take It With You, by George S. Kaufman and Moss Hart, in the Steppenwolf production of this play in Chicago.4. Alice is the \"normal\" member of a wacky family.  I am the wacky member of my Normal family.5.  Dove soap is 1/4 moisturizing cream! (I think they used to say \"one quarter cleansing cream\" on television commercials during To Tell the Truth.  My mother told me that once Kitty Carlisle, doing the live lead-in to the commercial, pronounced it \"dove\" with a long \"o,\" so it was about the past tense of \"dive\" instead of the bar soap with the bird of peace as part of its logo, but the past tense of \"dive\" as \"dove\" is also a bit apocryphal and was earlier, and more correctly, \"dived,\" though \"dove\" is now in common use and perfectly acceptable. That's what happens to language. It wears down, like a bar of soap.)6.  \"Will the real Justin Evans please stand up?\"  To Tell the Truth is a game show in which three people answer questions about the identity of one real person, who is there, the other two being imposters. The celebrity panelists, usually including Kitty Carlisle, try to figure out which one is the real bar of soap. At the end, Bud Collyer asks, \"Will the real so-and-so please stand up?\"  (But he never called anyone a so-and-so.)After reading all about the poet Justin Evans in some recent poet blog entries, I stumbled on Justin Evans in the blog of Margaret Evans Porter (via Julie Kistler's theatre blog); she was claiming him as her cousin and the author of White Devil. When I checked Amazon, I found yet another Justin Evans (Justin Wayne Evans), who has written a book of poems called Moonlit Memories.They can all stand up, and Kitty Carlisle can, too!(Not really. She died in 2007.)7.  I love random coincidii. But you already knew that. For example, Kitty Carlisle was in the opera The Rape of Lucretia, by Benjamin Britten, mentioned in yesterday's blog entry.Who gnu?

Munro has that ability to just say it, to include everything true and of interest, down to Canadian geography and exploring crypts in an old cemetery.Now I've returned to Part One, No Advantages, where I'll learn more about family history and people who left Scotland to settle in Canada.Good that I'm reading it how, as I'm headed to Canada this summer for this, a week of Toronto Pursuits, and specifically this, Strange Bedfellows, for which I'll need to re-read Billy Budd, by Herman Melville, Death in Venice, by Thomas Mann, and \"The Turn of the Screw,\" by Henry James, linked by the marvelous coincidence that they were all made into operas by Benjamin Britten.This and other fantastic \"learning vacations,\" chances to travel and talk with literary-minded people, are available at Classical Pursuits, the lovechild of Ann Kirkland.Additional random coincidii here are that the discussion leaders for Classical Pursuits are often also discussion leaders for Great Books Chicago, where short story writer Lindsay Tigue helps it all happen in her job with the Great Books Foundation.

(We also did an interview in that call, so I guess that’s forthcoming, too, and I hope it worked out!)Here is a link to the Rose Hunter feature in Escape Into Life.  It has amazing art by Kirsty Whiten.  The poems make you think, the art makes you think, and the juxtaposition makes you think again.  That’s what I hope, anyway, when I match up art and poetry! Once again, if you deeply admire a poet you think is right for Escape Into Life, send me contact info for that poet & some links to the poet’s work online (or blog, or press) to Kathleen [at] escapeintolife [dot] com. Speaking of which, who can put me in touch with Jeanette Allee?!(I do appreciate the effort it takes to nominate another poet. Sometimes it seems that many poets are eager to promote themselves, but that fewer poets take the time and effort to promote others, and/or to do the necessary reading! Other times, I see great generosity in this regard! The upcoming Jessy Randall feature comes from just such a nomination, for which I am very grateful!! Also grateful to Nic Sebastian, who uses this refer-a-poet method at Whale Sound, and who inspired me.)  In other news, it rained plenty, good for the grass, perennials, and new plantings.  And I have 4 gigantic bags of mulch to spread once it stops.  The hydrangea (from Solace reading!) is in the ground and thriving. Thank you again, Ellen Wade Beals, for the gorgeous flower. And her good news is a new review of her just-launched anthology, Solace in So Many Words!"},

(I might do this gradually, referring back to this post, and I might not reach 15, as I have given out other awards, and some blogs I read don't do this kind of thing. Others will have already been awarded!)--Contact each blogger who receives this nomination. (Will do this in a slatternly way. For instance, if you are a regular blog reader, and you see yourself here, you are notified!  You can let me know if you want to follow these rules or not.

{"title": "Ian Belknap is Brilliant", "date": "Friday, May 13, 2011", "text": "1) Ian Belknap is brilliant!2) Today is Cranky Doodle Day in the blog. How do these two \"fun facts\" connect? Ian Belknap is the best cranky doodler I have ever met.  And I have met him.  Briefly.  At the Encyclopedia Show.  Where he is the stern, frequently cranky \"fact-checker.\"  He scares me.Just look at his rants here, at his blog!  There's a lot of swearing as well as ranting.  I think he might like Clockwise Cat, where there is also swearing and ranting.  The new issue, #21, is up there now.  I do think Alison Ross, editor/publisher of Clockwise Cat,  might like the ranting of Ian Belknap, formerly attractive man.One of my favorite rants by Ian Belknap is this Essay Fiesta about the difficulty of obtaining corporate sponsorship. And it's not just because it was written to benefit the Howard Brown Health Center. I like it because it is funny, right on, and descends into the depths.One of my persistent cranks is how corporations keep trying to improve their images by aligning themselves with causes, and the brilliant Ian Belknap decimates them and himself for that impulse.  (Wait. \"Decimate\" means to kill every 10th person. Oh, never mind. I'm cranking at myself now.)For instance, yesterday I was watching The Daily Show and The Colbert Report--both were doing a nice job of decimating idiots--and a J.P. Morgan Chase commercial kept playing, muted grays and white animation showing how great a company they are, and how good they are to people! I loved the irony of it all.And I love the Japanese Hornet.And this guy, at Arthropoda.I would say more, but it's late in the day. Blogger was down in the morning (which made me cranky), and I am headed to a Cinco de Mayo party with margaritas today.Yes, I know, it's not Cinco de Mayo. It's Friday the 13th. But here is the Battle of Puebla, and there will still be margaritas, so I am going!"},
{"title": "The Forest of Sure Things", "date": "Thursday, May 12, 2011", "text": "Many thanks to Karen Weyant, who sent me The Forest of Sure Things, poems by Megan Snyder-Camp, because I was a winner in her Big Poetry Giveaway in April.  (Once again, Nandini, Where are You?  You are the winner in my Big Poetry Giveaway, the fine event initiated by Kelli Russell Agodon to celebrate National Poetry Month!)  Anyhoo…I read the book in my back yard yesterday, in the new summery sunshine, and enjoyed it so much! This account will be more personal reaction/connection than formal review, and probably more interpretive than evaluative, because that’s the way I am.  I do encourage you to read the book and discover your own connections & interpretations!Right away, in the pre-poem “Sea Creatures of the Deep,” I was socked in the eye (“O sockeye O rock sole O starry flounder”) by recognition and connection (“Dear threespine stickleback”), having written my own poem with species of mussels in it in just such odd juxtapositions.  So there was delight, and the pang of “Oh no! It’s been done!” that a fellow poet sometimes feels.  But, fear not, our poems are significantly different!  And hers has sea creatures; mine, the mussels of creek and river.Much later in the book, I thrilled to “Confession,” a poem that begins, “I used to pretend the ceiling was the floor.”  So did I!  So do I still, sometimes, hanging my head off a bed or couch to recreate that surreal landscape first discovered in childhood.  This poem is also fun for the artists’ shared dilemma: “I faked my way through office job / after job, the boss’s approach triggering / my blind clamor on the keyboard,” which is a fine reminder to me not to take a fake office job as I continue the search to make a living!I like “Parks Inspector,” too, another poem about a job-job, as I like to call it, one the poet has to have in addition to being a poet.  In this one, the speaker writes reports on “[w]hat the land did wrong,” and it gets fixed, sometimes immediately, by a “cold-patch truck” that follows her around.  Not surprisingly, with the inspector around, park “wardens hid in their huts,” a nice reminder that it’s not necessarily the “land” that’s doing something wrong.  (Pause to recall a sitcom, Parks & Recreation.)But the heart of the book, for me, is found in the poems of marriage, family, pregnancy, pregnancy dreams, birth, or (imagined? feared?) stillbirth in a seacoast locale, sometimes called Oysterville, where interesting things keep washing ashore.We get our bearings in the poem “Bearings,” which doesn’t really ground us in anything but mystery.  Has a little stillborn baby been buried in the back yard or not? It’s OK not to know, to let the grief and uncertainty build, the poem ending without end punctuation.In “Dream at 39 Weeks,” which sounds like a pregnancy dream to me, we are invited into another surreal landscape, a river with real but mechanical fish in it and a sudden quarry right in the middle of town, “The quarry held, among other things, / other ways we could have gone.  Softened boats / and our parents’ clothes, everything we’d been afraid to want.”I love the poignancy of that and the weird image of “softened boats.”  How could they float? In a poem later in the book, too, there is the image of a tree parting “a soft slab of rock.” I love this softening of hard things.  And, as you must have imagined by now, there are hard things tucked in among the mysteries in this book.One mystery unfolds as a sort of fabled ekphrasis in “Still Life as Landscape.”  The ocean stops, the tide “quit[s] its ebb and flow,” making the fish easy prey for the seabirds and confusing the townspeople: “We hoped it was a glitch, / a toe in the drain or a typo in the almanac.”  Nobody knows why it stopped or what to do to fix it. Together with the other poems, this, too, might be about a stillbirth. Or not. “Outside our sea held its breath.”I will simply mention a title, “41 Weeks,” to suggest a bit of relief here, and to sustain the mystery as well, as this is not a spoiler. After all, the titles are all there, laid out for you in the table of contents.  There is also a poem called “Wake,” and it has chairs and casseroles in it.And the title poem is one that grips from the first line: “In this land the children tear their hearts in half.” It makes me scared of “the forest of sure things” and pretty sure I should not live my life expecting any sure things, which might not, however, halt the desire.Now, having mentioned a central mystery in the book, I’ll mention that a blurb on the back cover offers a narrative summary I couldn’t quite gather—or didn’t want or need to—from the poems.  Either I’m dense, or it truly doesn’t matter that there be a prose explanation for how the poems fit (or don’t fit) together. I’d prefer to get my bearings (or not) from the poems themselves.For instance, and the title makes this pertinent, in “Narrative Distance,” we get a brief unlikely story of scientists experimenting with rats on empty islands with vacation potential.  We don’t know what these scientists hope or intend to find! We have no hypothesis. And yet I have a strong sense that random experimentation is 1) senseless and 2) these poems hope and intend to have meaning. So I continue to trust that poems will have their meaning in ways unaided by prose explanations, including my own!Now I want to point to a favorite poem from the book, called “As Light as Dark,” that exactly captures this inability to capture things…! (See what I mean about poetry?) The speaker of the poem is leaving a museum at a certain time of day, and there are no lights—“just pale roses”—to light the way.There is a word for thisbut I can’t remember it, a word for the sky in balance, just as lightas dark. For years I have tried to call it up.(Here’s where I urge Seana, word definer in Confessions of Ignorance, to find that word for Megan. Unless this is a mystery to be sustained, to go unsolved!) The speaker continues to long for it—the word or the sky in balance or the kind of light—as the poem goes on, until the constancy of not being able “to hold a single thing” must be accepted as part of movement and change—“even the good days seem rolled / in some other carpet”—and perhaps transformed:May this slipping away protect us,may the loss of days ease the ones I lovefrom their anger, that sturdy chaircircled all day by its shadow, without whicha dim sea would come to level our yard, levelas in make right."},
{"title": "Birdsong", "date": "Wednesday, May 11, 2011", "text": "Sudden summer here in central Illinois, with temperatures in the 80s, maybe going up to 90 today. The back yard is full of birds--the annual cardinals who nest in a pine shrub, robins, cedar waxwings, juncos, a woodpecker who comes and goes, a variety of sparrows and finches, and, lately, the brown-headed cowbird.The cowbird is so named because it tends to live near herds at the edge of agricultural areas, but we had three shiny males in the back yard. The males go ahead to \"case the joint\" and females come along later to lay their eggs in other birds's nests! In this case, probably the cardinals' nest. I saw a brown female a day after the visit from the males...The fate of these eggs varies. Some birds raise them, some recognize and toss them out, some build a new nest over the old. Yes, I've been working on a poem about this!You can learn more about the cowbird and hear the song at the link above, and learn all about birds at All About Birds, the Cornell Lab of Ornithology. Another fun place to listen to bird calls is Birdjam, where you can even get an app for your phone. Great bird pix at both places.These bird pictures are familiar to regular blog readers as paintings by Pamela Callahan (used by permission). You can see more of her work in her portfolio at Woman Made Gallery, or via the website and art studio she shares with her painter husband, Otter Creek Arts.  You can see from the photos of their environment that they must hear plenty of birdsong all the time!"},
{"title": "Up the Down Staircase", "date": "Tuesday, May 10, 2011", "text": "Oh, my gosh, it's Bel Kaufman's 100th birthday!  Thank you, Writer's Almanac!  You can read all about Bel there, or a brief article here, at Wikipedia.  As you can see if you click the wik, there is no free image of Bel for me to use, so I am showing you Sandy Dennis, from the film version of Up the Down Staircase, a book that just thrilled me when I read it, probably as a pre-teen preparing for high school! Then, when I got to high school, there was sort of an \"up the down staircase\" situation! It wasn't as strict or ludicrous a rule as in the book, but there was a preferred time for going up and down a certain staircase, sort of like rush hour lanes on Lake Shore Drive or escalators at the train station. Well, not even that strict. You could go against the flow and be smashed.Hmm, as I ponder my life, that is my life. But that's another story.Bel Kaufman's story is hilarious and satirical and could warm the cockles of many a frustrated or urban teacher's heart. It's an epistolary novel, proceeding mainly by way of letters and memos, the story unfolding inside these documents, as with Dracula! And there are urban high school horrors, as well.The Writer's Almanac tells us how Bel Kaufman really, really wanted to be a teacher and had a hard time passing the oral exam because of her Russian accent; it seems the examiners were predisposed against her, as well, flunking her on her interpretation of an Edna St. Vincent Millay poem even after Vincent herself praised the interpretation! Kaufman then used her novel to expose this kind of incompetence and bureaucracy as well as other obstacles in the public school system of her time, also revealing the dedication to teach and the desire to learn that can survive alongside such obstacles.Speaking of high school teachers, I enjoyed learning more about Justin Evans, teacher and poet, in two blogs this week. Sandy Longhorn discusses his new book, Town for the Trees, here, and Kristin Berkey-Abbott, who had earlier also reviewed this book, interviews him in her blog, here. Look closely at his answers to questions #7 and #8, aspiring poets and teachers!! Read, read, read, he says! And don't enter into teaching lightly!(And I'd add, read Up the Down Staircase!)I was tickled that, in the Wikipedia article, Bel Kaufman confesses that she hates writing. It is hard to do, for many people, including writers! My daughter was working on a paper for school last night, and there I was advising some \"prewriting,\" which indeed she tried, despite resistance. Encouraging her, I also called it her \"messy draft,\" the fun term from elementary school. I thank all those teachers who work so hard to help our children and students learn, think, and write! Thank you, thank you, thank you.Hang in there, all you tired public school teachers, here in May as the year winds up and down!"},
{"title": "Blue Lobelia", "date": "Monday, May 9, 2011", "text": "Last year my dad started a new fundraiser for his Kiwanis Club, the Mother's Day weekend flower sale. It was a wild success, as was the second annual event this past weekend. He modeled it on the Kiwanis flower sale in Akron, Ohio, after visiting family and hearing about it there.So, loyal to my dad, the local Kiwanis causes, and to flowers, I added sweet annuals to my perennial gardens yesterday.  I love tiny blue trailing lobelia, so that is in a couple hanging pots. I am also hoping my fantastic Swingtime Fucshia returns in its pot! Something is growing in there! Last year it bloomed gloriously, was entirely eaten by caterpillars, then bloomed gloriously again.Meanwhile, violets (the state flower) are blooming in the yard, along with wild strawberry. Both of these infiltrate the garden beds. My friend Lorel laughed when I told her I transplanted violets from the back yard to the front, as she yanks out and tosses all wild violets, but I am still trying to get something to grow naturally and return in front, shaded by two large trees.  The violets are taking, and the lily-of-the-valley are valiantly returning.Speaking of valiant, my poetry workshop, given the assignment of a poem-a-day in April, survived and resumed yesterday at the picnic table on my patio! With sparkling Prosecco and Rex-Goliath Free Range Red. Wine, poetry, beautiful blue sky on Mother's Day.  What could be better?If you need some blue lobelia, and didn't have a Kiwanis flower sale fundraiser handy, you can go here for these."},
{"title": "Mothers, Mist, Solace, Hydrangea", "date": "Sunday, May 8, 2011", "text": "I woke this morning to mist and the alarm, at six, and sent my husband off to his volleyball tournament (spring club season, middle school age girls). I woke again, at seven, to mist and the howling of a dog, and it was time to get up and see the white-misted world on this Mother's Day.Happy Mother's Day, if you are one, a fine thing to be. Many thanks to our mothers--we all technically had one--and I feel so glad and lucky to have a wonderful mother, still alive. My mother and I have been asked to read in church this morning the Mother's Day Proclamation by Julia Ward Howe, abolitionist, suffragist, poet, and author of the lyrics to \"Battle Hymn of the Republic.\" The proclamation is a call to women of the world to arise and stand against war, for mothers to meet and choose not to train their sons for war. Alas!The Proclamation is from 1870, and this country had just been through the Civil War, with Julia's \"Battle Hymn\" (1861) a popular song among the Union soldiers, says Wikipedia. I am impressed by the apparent contradictions here, the ultimate pacifist (post-war) having written a \"battle\" song.Now here are two connections:1) I met D. J. Lachance and his wife Lucile at the Solace in So Many Words release reading this weekend. He listened to her when she advised that he write in order \"to reunite with his family after returning from the Gulf War,\" as it says in his Solace bio. Many soldiers do not wish to speak of their war experience, but Dave (D. J.) has found a way to transform it to express it. Interestingly his piece, \"Nagasaki Shadows\" (referencing another war), is part of a stage piece, Voices From the Cafe, to be performed in Iran. Here again, war and peace, hand in hand.2) Ellen Wade Beals, editor of Solace in So Many Words, chose an anthology as her way to spread comfort in the world after 9/11 because she had contributed to a previous anthology of pieces by women who had lost their mothers when they were young, Kiss Me Goodnight.  As she said in her introduction to the book and in her opening remarks at the reading, she wanted this new anthology to include men's as well as women's voices and to address all kinds of needs for solace. And that's indeed what the book does!You can find the book at Amazon and independent bookstores, including Women and Children First bookstore in Chicago, site of this recent release reading, and at Barbara's Books on Halsted, near University of Illinois, site of the next release reading, Thursday, May 12, at 7 p.m.*  Here is the Events page for the book, and here is the home page. Ellen is eager for submissions of questions and comments on the book, or for your own slice of solace; go here for that!*And Seana, perhaps you would be interested in hosting a West Coast reading, as contributors include Ellen Bass!  [And I just realized--so I am back to edit in this link--that Seana has also written of Howe in her post on Mother's Day, including the text of the proclamation.  Go here to see that!]As I approached the bookstore on Clark Street, some gigantic gorgeous hydrangea plants were emerging from a car, hiding the humans behind them. It flashed on me that perhaps these were decorations for the reception after the reading, and indeed they were. What I couldn't have guessed was that I would get to take one home!And that it would fit in the jam-packed car of my son's belongings after he moved out of his dorm at UIC. In fact, I didn't fit in the car after that, and was left on the street to be scooped up later after he was dropped at a friend's place. He had a fun day at the Shedd and came home on the train. We had a fun day unpacking his stuff and buying a few more flowers at the second annual Kiwanis Mother's Day flower fundraiser, already in the ground or pots: white impatiens, blue lobelia, bright yellow marigold, variegated vinca and dahlia.  And on the patio sits the beautiful lavender blue hydrangea."},

{"title": "Izanagi & Izanami", "date": "Wednesday, May 4, 2011", "text": "As promised, here is the text of my Izanagi & Izanami Japanese creation myth, written and performed for The Encyclopedia Show: Creation Myths, April 29, 2011, a special event connected with Great Books Chicago: In the Beginning….My main source was my beloved Wikipedia, all the clickable and related things there, including links and articles on anime (Japanese animation).  But see also notes at the end!Don’t Shtup Your SisterOnce upon a time in Japan, at the beginning of the world,Izanagi and Izanami, boy & girl twins, took a jeweledspear to the bridge between heaven and earth, stirred up the ocean with it & where the spear spilled salty drops an island formed, called Self-Forming Island, and, voila (!), they’d created land!  Izanagi and Izanami fell in love and built a pillar so they could walk around it, which is how you got married in the olden days in Japan.  “Hello!” said Izanami when she met Izanagi going around the pillar.  Izanagi thought he should have said hello first, but they stillgot married, and had deformed children, and sent them off to sea in a boat.  “What did we do wrong?” they asked the gods, hoping to try again. “Izanami spoke first,” said the gods.  So round the pillar they went again, and this time Izanagi spoke first, and they had a bunch of undeformed children, who were Japanese islands & little gods.  Then Izanami died giving birth to the spirit of fire!Right at the end, she pushed out a baby water god, to douse future fires, but she herself was toast. Izanagi, who loved his Sister Wife, was so pissedhe chopped his fiery son Kagu-tsuchi into eight little volcanoes.  Poor Kagu-tsuchi, his nature was fire, his birth, the beginning of death.(Somebody has to be blamed first for a last breath.)                                                Izanagi went down to Yomi, the underworld,to bring back his love, Izanami, shrouded now in shadows and dark mists, never clearly seen.  Izanami even means “she who invites” illusion.“Come home,” said Izanagi.  “Too late,” said Izanami, “I already ate a pomegranate.”  Not daunted, Izanagi waited till she slept, took the comb from his long, long Japanese hair, lit it like a torch, the combnot the hair, and, voila (!): he saw his sweet hottie!Woe to the loss of illusion, for Izanami was a rotting carcass covered with maggots, so Izanagi yelpedand ran, waking Izanami, who sent the helpafter him, her women, in the form of a dozen shitakemushrooms (possible factual error), but he distractedthem by throwing down his headdress, transformedinto a bunch of grapes, by throwing down his comb,which sprang into a forest of bamboo, and finally peeda river to keep all of Yomi’s creatures on the other side.But Izanami, his twin, having seen the pee thing,his annoying but effective cure for jellyfish sting,pursued him to the opening of the Gates of Hell,as they were named, years later, in an anime sequel,so he pushed a boulder in her face but heard her yell“I’ll kill 1000 people for this! I’ll kill, kill, kill!”“I’ll make 1500 more!” he yelled back & felt her shakethe rock in her rage, and felt the self-formed earth quakeand saw the harbor wave begin to swell…(!) Oh, Izanami,Izanagi, oh, horrible origami, oh awful tsunami—anime!“Shtup” is a word meaning “push” or “nudge” as when you push or nudge a boulder into your sister’s face to keep her in the underworld, but of course it has other meanings, fully explored and exemplified in the Urban Dictionary.Fortunately, as Wendy Doniger made clear in her discussion of the Rig Veda and other creation myths, the closing talk on Sunday of the Great Books Chicago weekend, incest was simply part of the creation myths of many cultures for practical reasons (where else were people supposed to come from?) but not something advocated by these cultures. New myths got rid of the practice when it came to the behavior of the people. As we might recall, gods do a lot of things the people are not allowed to do.And, as Don Whitfield reminded me, Joseph Campbell also tells the story of Izanagi and Izanami in The Hero With a Thousand Faces.  So that’s where I’d read it before!  Campbell’s version is somewhat different from mine. In his, the underworld is known as the land of the Yellow Stream.  In mine, and Wikipedia’s, we learn where the yellow stream actually came from!  But both Campbell and I made the connection with Orpheus going down to the underworld to rescue Eurydice, and how that does not really work out well in either myth.When I rehearsed my poem for my son, he giggled at “pomegranate.”  I thought he’d gotten my joke on the Persephone/Proserpine eating of the pomegranate in the underworld (another connection of Japanese and ancient Greek/Roman myth), but, no, an industrial design student, he was laughing at a marvelous industrial design joke involving the pomegranate phone.  (Takes a while to load, but worth the wait.  Hilarious.  Trust me.  Click every option!)"},
{"title": "The Encyclopedia Show", "date": "Tuesday, May 3, 2011", "text": "My first job out of college was as a staff writer and editor for an encyclopedia. It was a digest encyclopedia, culling the main facts of, well, everything in the world, from the other, bigger encyclopedias and Facts on File in order to update yearly the existing entries, most originally written by experts, but this was also the year of a major revision, with the addition of new material, so I got to do some of that, too.Fun fact: I got to engage Alvin Goldfarb, now the president of Western Illinois University but then on the theatre faculty at Illinois State University, to write the theatre history article. (That's for Hannah Stephenson. See her poem, \"Name Dropping\" in her wonderful poem-a-day-in-response-to-images blog, The Storialist.)And today's rambling is to link up encyclopedias and theatre for the fabulous Encyclopedia Show, a hilarious event in Chicago, dandelioning up in various other cities now as well. A regular cast of actors, comedians, and musicians, and a fact-checker, plus invited guests, present encyclopedic knowledge on a theme.This was a special event we got to attend as participants in Great Books Chicago this past weekend; the theme of our show was Creation Myths, and I got to write an \"article\" and \"perform\" it (more on that tomorrow).And tomorrow night's show--Wednesday, May 4--is Flightless Birds. Transport yourself there, somehow, to see it, if you can.But I would like to rhapsodize a bit right now on the singer/songwriters Diana Lawrence and Naomi Ashley who sang their encyclopedia entries in the Creation Myths show.  Diana sat at the piano and played and sang \"Purusha,\" her haunting song about the cosmic self in Vedic origin myths.  In Diana's song, a contemporary soul is seeking to give herself over completely in order to fly and be free in the universe.  In the Rig Veda myth, Purusha is a giant sacrificed and essentially dismembered by the gods to make the people and animals of the earth.  (This tied in with Wendy Doniger's talk on dismemberment and origin myths of the Rig Veda on Sunday at Great Books Chicago.)Naomi Ashley played the guitar and sang her original and hilarious song about Al Gore inventing the Internet. Known around town for her comic songs, Naomi is also a serious singer/songwriter, and I have been listening to her CD, Another Year or So, which has a country/folky feel and lyrics both poignant and ironic, the mix working beautifully in the title song, about what a couple is doing to hold together for \"another year or so.\"Most of the songs are by Ashley herself, but album ends with \"All the Best\" by John Prine. And I love the note about \"Soft on My Shoulder,\" music & lyrics by Fred Eaglesmith: \"Recorded in our crappy apartment on Foster in 2003.\"  Another song is recorded at the Uptown Poetry Slam! Otherwise, the CD is recorded at Strobe Recording in Chicago, but I love that mix of raw into the  professional studio sound here. Ashley's honest, yearning voice and lyrics come through in everything.Pictured above: Encyclopedia Show hosts Shanny Jean Maney and Robbie Q Telfer, who, by marvelous coincidence, are people from my town (via their schooling).  Met Robbie and Patrick (the Intern) Carberry (a regular cast member) in Babbitt's Books when they were regular customers, and will meet Shanny now for coffee or wine in beautiful Uptown Normal as soon as we can, now that we know we are weird sisters."},

After looking at the creation myths of the world over this past weekend at Great Books Chicago, its theme this year “In the Beginning…,”  I can point to the spot (Ch. 9, verses 5-6) in Genesis (King James Version) where (the character of) God seems to sanction blood vengeance. Or at least to acknowledge and accept the bloodthirsty nature of the humans sent from Eden and newly disembarked from Noah’s ark, humans made in God’s own image and in a new covenant with God.  “Kill yourselves,” God seems to say here, “for it won’t be done by me.”And, according to this author, this God spoke \"in his heart\" as well as out loud:…and the LORD said in his heart, I will not again curse the ground any more for man’s sake; for the imagination of man’s heart is evil from his youth; neither will I again smite any more every thing living, as I have done. (Ch. 8, verse 21)It’s also the birthday of the King James Version. So it must also be Random Coinciday in the blog.This weekend I had amazing conversations with people from all over the country, including a doctor from Cincinnati who is a Muslim from Pakistan. I am thinking of him with special fondness, sympathy, and concern this morning. I am pondering the Abrahamic tradition, which links Christian, Jew, and Muslim in the texts so often referred to as the Old Testament (by those who have a New Testament).As I literally unpack my bags this morning, I will also unpack what I have learned, or re-learned. If I can. I have a translation of the Rig Veda to read, a talk by translator Wendy Doniger spinning these Hindu hymns in my head in harmony with other mythic traditions.I have a copy of Quantum Physics for Poets, co-written by Leon M. Lederman and Christopher T. Hill, signed by Lederman, a gentle and funny man who spoke to us about the need for science education in the United States and who won the Nobel Prize for Physics. Obviously, I seem to be an intended reader of this book.I’ll continue to report on this event this week.  I’ll continue to ponder “the imagination of man’s heart” through the imagination of those who write about it.For now, I’ll be humming “Blue Moon” while I gather myself up into one person after communing with many persons."},

{"title": "Voice Lessons", "date": "Wednesday, April 27, 2011", "text": "National Poetry Month is dwindling down, four poems to go, and people are exhausted, poets losing their energy and inspiration. So, 1) today’s poem-a-day prompt is “exhaustion,” and 2) you might get a lift by looking at Paulette Beete’s poetry feature, just up today at Escape Into Life.  Sing it, baby!I've been reading Voice Lessons, Paulette's new poetry chapbook, in small, sweet bits since it arrived from Plan B Press--perfect name for a small poetry press, eh?  Sorry, I can seem to get an image of the book cover any larger than this thumbprint (or it gets blurry), but you can enlarge it at the press's website.  It's a lovely drawing.Paulette is also included in the anthology pictured above, Full Moon on K Street: Poems About Washington, D.C.  Paulette lives in the D.C. area now, but our paths crossed at poetry workshops when we both lived in Chicago, so I have been a reader of her work for a long time.  I reviewed her first chapbook, Blues for a Pretty Girl (Finishing Line Press, 2005) for RHINO, and I am glad to see a couple of poems from that, including “Voice Lesson,” here in Voice Lessons.  (You can see samples from both books in the Escape Into Life feature.)And, yes, this book is about all kinds of singing—songs of praise, songs of woe, choir singing, blues, jazz, birdsong.  And about finding, developing, training one’s voice. There are poems like prayers, litanies, incantations. There are prose poems, numbered poems, and even collage poems that mix voices, the poet as arranger of a new song.There are poems to Billie Holiday and to Eva Cassidy. There are poems to a street, a poem to the vagina. Anything that can sing or be sung to might be here! Somehow, somewhere, a voice will be breaking to make someone whole.There is a rich, conflicted relationship with the mother in these poems.  “Naming,” a ghazal, begins:In prayer, my mother gargles my name, in her throat a small stone.I tremble on her tongue light as a stone.and ends:She names me Paulette, meaning small:I grow smaller still, my name growing cozy as a stone.And “Prophecy,” a prose poem, begins:Mama, I said, I’m going to be a poet.  Mama, I said, I will make your words mine. Her large hand winding its way around my small hands like a manacle, her lips parted.Throat, tongue, lips recur throughout this book.  “I didn’t know I loved my tongue,” she says in “Poem after Hikmet.” “I used to think it was a liar. My own tongue!” The mouth is used to speak, to sing, to taste, to kiss, to eat, to love. And, in “The Woman’s Wardrobe,” to ask:Am I an intersection of skin & voicethe shadow of that intersectiona manipulation of skin & memorya blank wall?And maybe to let us know what voice lessons are for:Later after you’ve unhooked yourself……later when you are sleepingI’ll count your brokenness..…            where the harmonicabruised Stormy Monday from your mouthI’ll count the places my body mournsyour hands the fleshy length of your fingersharp-bit rough worry your lipslike a stone greedy unstitchingthat raw place where you measure lossmy tongue building a sacristy for hunger.  And here is Paulette, reading, on the Big Read Blog!"},

And it's Ted Kooser's birthday, one of our Poet Laureates of the United States.I have three of Kooser's books, two inherited from Griff, a family friend who collected books and movies, his tiny apartment an overflowing library.  Local Wonders, a sort of memoir on place, contains Griff's little yellow post-it notes and more elaborate notes on yellow lined paper, and Flying at Night has his characteristic pencil checkmarks and loopy marginalia beside the poems. Delights & Shadows is clean, and my own.Today's Writer's Almanac quotes Kooser from an interview in Guernica Magazine, saying, about his \"success\"--I guess the success of being named Poet Laureate--\"The image is this feeling like one of those telephone poles...on which a lot of notices have been stapled and then torn away, and they leave little triangles of paper, held by staples. On those notices were things lost and things found and the photos of people missing, and now even the photos are missing as a metaphor for what happens in life. All this experience is tacked upon us and then torn away, and we become a residue of this experience.\"Competing in my head at this moment, the wry and cheerful \"Sadder but Wiser\" song from The Music Man, sung by Robert Preston, and \"Genius Next Door,\" sung by Regina Spektor.And this very short poem by Kooser, from Delights & Shadows: StarlightAll night, this soft rain from the distant past.No wonder I sometimes waken as a child."},
{"title": "When the Emperor was Divine", "date": "Sunday, April 24, 2011", "text": "I am reading too many things at once.  One of them is When the Emperor was Divine, by Julie Otsuka.  It is a lovely book--a crystal clear prose style, a quiet truth telling from the perspectives of multiple characters inside that unifying style, and the story of Japanese Americans in 1942 suddenly \"reclassified\" in the middle of their lives and sent off to internment camps.I'm reading this one at my daughter's request, as she is reading it for school and really likes it. Whenever my daughter asks me to read something, I do it. It's a wonderful way to connect. The other night she asked me to read it aloud to her while she ate her bedtime snack of sliced strawberries and mandarin oranges.My book group read Hotel at the Corner of Bitter and Sweet, by Jamie Ford, which addresses the same historical moment, but I am liking this even better for its swift telling and simplicity. I use \"simplicity\" as a word of praise here, far from \"simplistic,\" a damning word, and I notice that not everyone out there makes that distinction, so I am clarifying here. It is a directness, and, in this case, a fullness inside restraint. It is a trust, a confidence, that saying what is there will be enough.No need to embellish or over-explain or tell the reader what to feel. The reader can be trusted to feel what is there if you say what is there. I admire this in poetry, too, so I'd call this a poetic style.The subtlety and complexity of human existence are beautifully handled by the simplicity of diction and style in this book. There is selection of detail, and of what to say and what not to say, so there is mystery, human mystery, and a respect for the things we can seldom know or say.  All are evoked in few words. I love that!*****April 24 poem-a-day prompt: Easter"},
{"title": "Odes to Tools", "date": "Saturday, April 23, 2011", "text": "I once had a dream to start a website called Men’s Tools.orgI thought better of it. Hear it as if announced on NPR, as in “N-P-R-dot-O-R-G”. Yes, it’s “men’s tools dot orgy.”  See what I mean?  But my husband really does look good in a tool belt.  (And I call him “my husband” above, because I don’t like to name my family members online.  I’m not claiming possession of him.  Though, um, yes, I am.  And I am fine being called “his wife,” though I did keep my own last name.)In April, I’ve been cheering on Kristin Berkey-Abbott and Dave Bonta who are reading four poetry books in common for National Poetry Month.  In particular, Dave has been reading (just about) a poetry book or chapbook a day, including one of mine.If you click the link to his review of Broken Sonnets, you may be worried that Dave is insulting me. Maybe he is! But if you keep reading, and some people don’t, after the first two sentences, he says some really nice things.  So fear not!But he did read and review the book while drinking, and, in fact, he says, got drunk.  So, tit for tat, last night I drank two glasses of wine in order to finish reading Odes to Tools, by Dave Bonta, and report on it!  Seemed best to do this at night so I could check to see that I didn’t say anything rude or inappropriate (other than “tit for tat”) before posting this morning.Also, this is in keeping with Slattern Day in the blog.So!  Odes to Tools is great fun, and I learned a lot about tools.  Living with a carpenter-electrician-car-mechanic-reluctant-plumber with a tool-belt, who just fixed our overworked sump pump, I know a few things about tools, but not everything, and certainly not everything about what can be done with tools in poems.First off, even the titles of the poems are delightful: “Ode to a Socket Wrench,” “Ode to a Claw Hammer,” “Ode to a Hatchet,” “Ode to a Hoe,” “Ode to a Coping Saw,” “Ode to a Shoehorn.”Second off, you might worry that a book called Odes to Tools is full of stodgy old odes, just as Dave worried that my book might actually be full of stodgy unbroken sonnets.But these odes to tools are not dictionary odes, as in:“1. A lyric poem of some length, usually of a serious or meditative nature and having an elevated style and formal stanzaic structure.”These are short poems, mostly a page each, informal and lively in diction, in praise of the particular tool, or, yes, quite lyrical and meditative, sometimes seeming to go off topic into a wonderful, wild musing, as in this opening stanza of “Ode to a Claw Hammer,” which is dear to my heart, given that Thor’s Day is a category of my own existence:Back when all angels were male,the hammer was the firstperfect androgyne.That’s just gorgeous!  And here’s another stanza about the claw hammer:This is no claw, but a pair of legsstrong enough between themto give birth to nails.That gets it exactly, both the look and power of the tool and the experience of childbirth.  And “Ode to a Musical Saw” reminds us that tools have other uses, including as musical instruments.  This poem ends breaking my heart:There’s a sweet spot, the streetmusicians say, & they find itin you.  Where the heart might be,systole & diastole in perfect balance,if you were more than cartilage.The pure tone floats upthrough two octaves of rejoicingat your deliverancefrom lumber.Or is that grief?Again, gorgeous.  And rings so true.  (And remember there is also such a thing as a “clawhammer banjo”!)Nor are these odes“2a. A choric song of classical Greece, often accompanied by a dance and performed at a public festival or as part of a drama”but they could be! Or“2b. A classical Greek poem modeled on the choric ode and usually having a three-part structure consisting of a strophe, an antistrophe, and an epode”but it was fun to revisit my theatre history in anticipation of Odes to Tools, which are more like free verse songs of praise, though there is a bit of Greek right away in “Ode to a Hand Truck,” by way of the opening line, “Eohippus of the truck family,” surely a great image, made even more fun by lines 2 and 3, “divergent offspring / of wheelbarrows,” so we see a kind of evolution before our very eyes!Eo + hippus (Greek for horse) = extinct ancestor of the horseSo much depends upon divergent wheelbarrows! But Bonta provides his own allusion to the famous William Carlos Williams poem, the bane of so many high school students, the joy of so many poets, in his last stanza:The job over,I return the hand truckto its spot underthe barn forebay,between the Ford dump truck& the old wheelbarrow,no longer red, on whichso littlenow depends.(Who needs a wheelbarrow when you’ve got a hand truck?)I highly recommend this man’s tools (and this man’s odes) and suggest you read about his inspiration for the book here.I admire the precision of language and observation in this book, how the setting unfolds around the focus on the tool at hand, and how each poem, moving quickly and lightly, can also, if it wants, take on a large philosophical idea. I love how there’s a life here, a personal history, work, a childhood.And I love how the poet can provide his own little river of anaphoric love in “Ode to a Shovel”:I love groundbreaking...…I love cutting sod……I love giving the earth…And I can guess, from “Ode to a Chalk Line Reel,” that he would love the fact that my husband still uses a reel with string for an “electric blue” chalk line.  And, of course, we both love a spirit level.  (Yes, I sound a little sentimental about tools, but it turns out I am not drunk at all.)You can get a copy of Odes to Tools via the publisher, Phoenicia Publishing, in Montreal, here, where you can also click to listen to Dave read the poems.  And be sure to visit his blog, Via Negativa, and his online magazine, qaartsiluni.*****April 23 poem-a-day prompt: Shakespeare's birthday!"},

And wild laughter!So, although it is not at all Tuesday, it is Fat Tuesday in the blog. Surely I will still be fat on Tuesday.I enjoyed the movie Eat, Pray, Love, which had plenty of food in it, including the pizza in Naples, and Javier Bardem is delicious. Richard Jenkins (Richard from Texas) is appropriately bittersweet. Don't worry, I'm not going to keep mentioning the tasty men.When I got home, I had a poem acceptance from Sweet!

I hope the pizza made it into the movie. (Is it possible the pizza could be made with drunken goat cheese?!)Now to follow up on yesterday:First, here is the Etsy site for Dan-Ah Kim! This is where Julie, who commented yesterday, got a print of \"Seek Me,\" the Red Riding Hood one, and where you can get any one you want! Yay!Next, here is Sandy Longhorn's blog entry on her EIL feature, and you'll see you can sign up at her blog for the Big Poetry Giveaway, too, and maybe win Blood Almanac, her book!And, because I love the third-party submission option and overall generosity of Nic Sebastian at Whale Sound, I'd also like to let you know how you can let me know of poets I can scout for Escape Into Life!If you know of a poet living anywhere in the world who writes in English and who seems perfect for Escape Into Life, you can let me know, now that we have email, at kathleen(at)escapeintolife(dot)com. Please look at several of the poetry features, and see if your favorite poet might work out there.  Then send me an email with some links to your poet online and contact info, and I will try to check it out in a timely manner. As with many poetry editor gigs, this is a volunteer job, so I have to fit it into my wacky life.Know that I am also reading books and journals, and looking for poets in print, too, but as Escape Into Life is an online adventure, the editors want readers to be able to find their contributors somewhere on the web, too.See Nic's description of a \"web-active poet\" here, and also know that I can feature less \"web-active\" writers, too, sort of helping them have a web presence, hoping that there's at least a blog, a press with a website, or a few online publications for EIL readers to seek out on their own.And while you are at Whale Sound, read and listen to the wonderful poems there!!*****And finally, because I am retreating, here are the next few poem-a-day prompts:April 15: your take on taxation this yearApril 16: being quietApril 17: field trip, free choice, maybe a ghazal"},

There you will find a grouping of her saint poems and fairy tale poems, including \"Fairy Tale for Girls Enthralled by the Storm.\" They are paired with lyrical collage paintings by Dan-Ah Kim.Kristin Berkey-Abbott suggested that I talk about how I do things as poetry editor for Escape Into Life, and it is about time I explained myself!  But first, let me cheer on Kristin and Dave Bonta, of Via Negativa, who are celebrating National Poetry Month in their blogs by reading and reviewing/reporting on the books they read!As poetry editor for Escape Into Life, I work as a poetry scout. When founding editor Chris Al-Aswad asked me to do this, as his previous poetry editor, Mark Kerstetter (a fine poet and blogger himself!) was stepping back, I told him I would prefer not to read submissions as I had done enough of that already! (I had paid my dues as an editor for RHINO for ten years and, before that, as an associate editor for Poetry East.) Since I read a heck of a lot of poetry in books, journals, and online, anyway, I figured I would stumble upon poets I admired who would fit the readership and artistic sensibility of the Escape Into Life \"adventure,\" as I call it.This \"poetry scout\" strategy was fine with Chris and, in fact, matched what he and the art editors were already doing--looking at lots of stuff online for their Artist Watch features! And, Chris confessed, most of the poetry submissions he was getting were \"bad.\" Probably from novice poets, excited to be writing, but who hadn't \"paid their dues\" by reading enough poetry yet. Sigh....  It's a dilemma.So I scout out and invite poetry submissions from poets I think would be good for Escape Into Life. Not everybody follows up, but most do, and I get to pick some wonderful poems.  After I choose the poems, I look through the Artist Watch selections, or search by category for Paintings, Drawings, Collage, Photography, to find the perfect match of poem and art. Sometimes, while arranging the feature at the website, I try the poems out with 2 or 3 artists to see what juxtapositions I like best--sometimes the best \"match\" is a strange contrast! I love doing this.But I must share with you my sadness about Chris, who died young, and here is the odd coincidence connected to that, in an entry from last August. I cannot tell you how glad I am that his sister, father, and fellow editors are keeping the adventure going as his legacy.It's a beautiful blue day here so far, and I hope to walk out in it on the local hiking trail later today.  The thunder and lightning are coming tomorrow.*****April 14 poem-a-day prompt: thunder and lightning"},

I was so glad to learn more and be there in support. And it’s possible I’ll be on the tv news or have my picture in the paper and someone will want to civilly unite with me.  (Sorry, married to a man already.)One source of humor was what to call oneself: “civil unionized,” “civilized,” or “civilly united”? They all sound fine to me, especially “civilized,” but I understand how “married” would be so much simpler, so I’ll hope for that someday, too.Interesting quirks and complications re: taxes. Yeesh. Double paperwork will be required, as one can file jointly on state taxes but must still file separately on federal taxes, and the numbers all have to work out. Tax accountants will be getting some good business out of this, and I am thankful that 1) we have a tax man 2) he is humorously willing to be our “marriage counselor,” as in keep us together since trying to do our taxes without him might lead to divorce, and 3) the government hasn’t shut down, meaning our tax refund might come reasonably soon in the scheme of things.Plus, there was cake.  As in wedding cake.In other news, I won’t necessarily have to lead a discussion on Genesis for Great Books Chicago, though I am really enjoying re-reading it and creating discussion questions.  I will be the back-up leader in case anyone gets sick or delayed.  The organizer made this switch to give a new leader his own discussion group and so I don’t have to be super-focused on that, because I am performing in The Encyclopedia Show that same night!  (If my creation myth is approved.)This is a sort of live encyclopedia event, also recorded for the radio, and I have been listening to past performances on WBEZ to prepare.  You can listen at Audiopedia; click the show title to be taken to the WBEZ program.Yesterday I got what I hope is a final draft of my piece, which is in rhyming, slant rhyming, or internally rhyming couplets!  And, by random coincidence, I used to be an encyclopedia editor.  I love how my life keeps going in circles.Er, um…?!

It's also Part 2 of my rhapsody on Willa Cather, as I re-read \"Tom Outland's Story\" in preparation for Great Books Chicago, later this month.\"Once again I had that glorious feeling that I've never had anywhere else, the feeling of being on the mesa, in a world above the world.\"I feel like that when I write sometimes.  (Other times, as on yesterday's writing projects, I feel like I'm typing and typing and getting nowhere.) A writer friend, Candace, was talking about how happy she feels when she writes, that time slips away. Or, as Willa Cather says, \"Happiness is something one can't explain. You must take my word for it.\" (I think I quoted this a while back, too.) \"Troubles enough came afterward, but there was that summer, high and blue, a life in itself.\"But there's also something terrible that happens in this story of \"two poor cow-punchers\" entrusted with a herd in New Mexico. They find something wonderful on the mesa, know it to be valuable, and lose it anyway: \"something that had been preserved through the ages by a miracle, and handed on to you and me, two poor cow-punchers, rough and ignorant, but I thought we were men enough to keep a trust.\"As I type it out, I know it applies not just to the treasures they find but to the treasure of their time together, and the story is indeed about misunderstandings of tangible and intangible value, one of my own obsessions.These two men both seem to know when there's hell to pay, and that some things can't be undone.  All I can say about that is, no matter how terrible it gets, don't punch any cows. And here's this from Cather: \"Every morning, when the sun's rays first hit the mesa top, while the rest of the world was in shadow, I wakened with the feeling that I had found everything, instead of having lost everything.\" A good way to wake up.*****April 12 poem-a-day prompt: terrible twos"},

To the northwest, over toward Utah, we had the Mormon Buttes, three sharp blue peaks that always sat there. The Blue Mesa was south of us, and was much stronger in colour, almost purple. People said the rock itself had a deep purplish cast.  It looked, from our town, like a naked blue rock set down alone in the plain...Sometimes I feel like a naked blue rock set down alone in the plain...Later in the story, the sun comes up and goes down on the mesa:It was light up there long before it was with us.  When I got up at daybreak and went down to the river to get water, our camp would be cold and grey, but the mesa top would be red with sunrise, and all the slim cedars along the rocks would be gold--metallic, like tarnished gold-foil. Some mornings it would loom up above the dark river like a blazing volcanic mountain. It shortened our days, too, considerably. The sun got behind it early in the afternoon, and then our camp would lie in its shadow. After a while the sunset colour would begin to stream up from behind it. Then the mesa was like one great ink-black rock against a sky on fire.Oh, my. Gorgeous. I hope we can always see, care for, and appreciate such beauty here on our world. Cather is describing the Blue Mesa in New Mexico.  When I visit the National Park Service site for the Curecanti National Recreation Area of Colorado, I see that there will be no access to the Blue Mesa Reservoir in the case of a government shutdown.  Sigh... Numerous dilemmas. And I hope it is OK to share this beautiful picture of Blue Mesa Lake, which I found here.I love \"all the slim cedars...\"  I love that \"great ink-black rock against a sky on fire.\"*****April 11 poem-a-day prompt:  Blue Monday"},

Yes, many of us, poets or celebrants, are writing a poem a day.Every April, I get 30 drafts, some that develop into real poems after tweaking or deep revision, some that get left behind forever, and some that turn out to be \"gift\" poems, the ones that fall out whole. I am always amazed and delighted, once I've got a poem out there in the world, to realize how many of my published poems were generated in these April celebrations.Today's prompt, in my blog and my real-life Poetry Someday workshop, is \"the need for wine or beer.\" I imagine I made this one up to fit the day of the week, as in TGIF, just as yesterday's prompt was \"Thor, Norse god of thunder,\" to line up with Thursday. But other prompts have been and will be entirely random.And that brings me to another tally--my \"eight days a week\" project. After the 365-days-of-reading project, I lined up my life in \"categories of existence,\" seeing if I would indeed have seven, to line up with the days of the week, but I had eight, and I don't believe in linear time, so now I write about things eight days a week, sometimes doubling up, sometimes skipping or neglecting certain categories.I am happy to report that Cranky Doodle Day is lagging behind in the tally! I am not very cranky these days! (I do sort of doodle. These would be verbal doodles, on scaps of paper that pile up in various areas and turn into poems, blog entries, job applications, or to-do lists.  And I do sing nonsense songs around the house.)So I was looking for anything to complain or crank about, and I only came up with these:1) An editor wanted to remove two commas from a poem, saying they were ungrammatical.  (There was a reason for them, but it surely wasn't worth explaining or arguing about.) I said it was fine to take them out. I think Mary Oliver would agree.2) My husband has a bad cold (poor him!), but now I might be getting it just before I have to do a poetry reading in Chicago on Sunday. Water, juice, tea! (Oh! Wine, beer!)3) It's raining. What's the point in cranking about the weather?!  Soon, soon, it will be warm and sunny, and, as far as I know, this rain isn't particularly acid or toxic. It will bring May flowers.In the background of Cranky Doodle Day is Crafty Doodle Day and, alas, I'm behind on crafty things like poetry collages and the book purse, but soon I will be making a 5x7 piece of art work for a local exhibit (it shall remain anonymous until sold to benefit the gallery, so I won't say any more about it here!), as, I hope, will my actual artist husband, once he gets over his bad (poor him!) cold.So, not cranky! Rain, rain, go or stay, then come back on the eighth day... Not logical! Non-linear!

{"title": "Buddha's Birthday", "date": "Thursday, April 7, 2011", "text": "Happy Birthday to the Buddha, to Billie Holiday, and to the Internet, and thanks to the Writer's Almanac for this Random Coinciday in the blog. The Buddha's actual birthday is not exactly known, and the date of its celebration varies in the world, according to the lunar cycle and the specific cultural customs, but today is the celebration of Buddha's birth in Japan.In Japan, children will pour a sweet tea, traditionally made of hydrangea, over the heads of statues of the Buddha.  This holiday, called Vesak or Vesakha, among other names, is a day of thanks and re-commitment to living a noble life. In the legends of the Buddha's life and death, this was a day of April showers leading to May flowers, in a sense, as the rain at the time of Buddha's birth caused all the flowers to bloom, and the weeping as the Buddha was dying caused him to remind his attendant Ananda not to sorrow at the disintegration of life but to remember the eternal truths.Today's celebration in Japan seems especially poignant and horrific, as the local rain and local vegetation in some areas will be dangerous and not the life-giving nurture we want it to be for some time to come. A new commitment to a noble life is all the more urgent, and must result in action. It is a day of thanks in Japan; from afar, I thank the workers who are giving their noble lives to clean-up and repair.Today's imaginary soundtrack is Lady in Satin, Billie Holiday's last album, her vibrant voice now more fragile but steeped in her life of dark struggle and deep emotion. I was moved to read of her generosity in a life of poverty; most of her earnings were sucked up by the unscrupulous, but she'd leave a plate of money on her table for out-of-work musicians, for food or cab fare.It's William Wordsworth's birthday, too, and one of my favorite poems ever is his \"Ode on Intimations of Immortality.\" He is also famous for his \"Daffodils,\" now blooming.  So, daffodils for Wordsworth, hydrangea for the Buddha, gardenias for Lady Day.While you're on it, say happy birthday to the Internet, and be sure to thank Al Gore for inventing it.*****April 7 poem-a-day prompt:Thor, Norse god of thunder"},

Speaking of blue, I continue to admire Gina Berriault's stories in Women in Their Beds. A lot of them of are blue. A lot have a slice-of-life quality, showing us the blue moment and/or the tender, aching moment of love or grief or regret, and doing nothing artificial to resolve it, erase it, or appease the gods.I love the coincidence that some of her stories are about actresses, artists, or novelists, and about the dilemmas of balancing life and art, or what is reasonable to reveal in art, or why it might not be reasonable to reveal (or distort) it.That reasoning goes on in the reader's head (my pretty blue head), not necessarily the story.*****So, prompts for April poem-a-day:April 1--personal follyApril 2--slatternly tendenciesApril 3--group dreaming (Google Inception or Jung)April 4--back-to-work"},

Apparently, via Facebook, local college students had invited college students from all over to come to Normal (what an exciting location!) to party this weekend. Local university and town officials were proactive, increasing security, closing liquor stores early, and reminding tenants of fines for big, loud parties, and, poof, not much happened.That is, there was no Saturnalia.  Saturnalia was a feasting, gift-giving, drinking party and pagan holiday that in some ways resembles Christmas, falling in mid-winter, the timing noted by scholars and theologians. And while it is April, we do have winter temperatures at the moment, and we did have hail yesterday, a fine April Fool's joke on all of us hoping for spring. But I do love this detail of Saturnalia:\"Saturnalia involved the conventional sacrifices, a couch (lectisternium) set out in front of the temple of Saturn and the untying of the ropes that bound the statue of Saturn during the rest of the year.\"I don't love the sacrifices. I do love the couch coincidence.  As this is the time of year when couches and armchairs start to emerge on front porches and lawns, to ease the drinking parties of students. Except for when there are ordinances against that. I wonder if the council debates do include references to the ancient Roman rites?Anyhoo, the sun is up, the sky is blue...Ah!

(It's been made into a movie, with Robert Duvall and Glenn Close, and Berriault also wrote the screenplay for it. And it was previously adapted for television.) After I'd read \"The Stone Boy,\" I thought, \"Who is this writer?\" and kept looking for her in anthologies and bookstores. (I found her collection at Babbitt's, when I worked there, on the floor.)Alas, she was, apparently, a \"writer's writer,\" defined here as someone admired by other writers for \"purity and passion\" but sidestepped by fame.  \"It seems I'm going to be famous,\" Emily Dickinson once wrote (to whom? my source is The Belle of Amherst, the play by William Luce that pieces together snippets of notes and letters) but it seemed her fame would come in the form of immortality, a thing she also hoped for.  Berriault eventually met with fame and acclaim but, the above article claims, wrote mostly in obscurity.No wonder Richard Yates loved her! He, too, was appreciated by other writers but suffered obscurity after early acclaim, and the film of his novel Revolutionary Road was made after his death. Yates said, \"Gina Berriault is one of the finest writers alive.\" But, as you can see from her New York Times obituary, she's dead.I like Berriault in the way I like Alice Munro--although the scenes and characters are very different--for the close observation of real human behavior, the understated but firm connection to the emotional life, and the quiet, steady confidence that just to say what's happening is enough, to leave as is whatever is mysterious, to reveal whatever can unfold on its own.Here is a brief Salon review of Women in Their Beds; reviewer Katherine Whittamore doesn't like the title story as much as I do but we both love the librarian/homeless man story, \"Who Is It Can Tell Me Who I Am?\" By chance, I am about to read \"The Overcoat,\" the story mentioned at the end of this review, and a title also used by Nicolai Gogol for a story I have also discussed in a Great Books salon.Full circle.And I am a woman in her joy, who answered the doorbell last night to find my son, the home boy! College friends dropped him off on their way elsewhere for the weekend. I knew he was coming but did not know the details, and at that moment was expecting my daughter at the door. He then surprised his father and his sister, as each came home, and was himself surprised to find his mattress stolen, as was the overcoat in Gogol.But that's another story."},

And this morning I bought a metal meat tenderizer, because yesterday I realized once again that I didn't have one, and some meat needs pounding.At some point it occurred to me that all this was coming together for Thor's Day (Thor = hammer-wielding Norse god of thunder) in the blog, and I was taken aback.  There are articles and blog musings out there about how blogging is changing people's consciousness, as is the whole technological revolution--cellphones, iPods, iPads, texting, cloud thinking, etc., etc.Wait! Am I My Blog?!I'm pretty sure I am not my blog: I have a life outside it, I don't do things just to blog about them, and, as I like to tell people who ask what I'm doing or how I am these days, I have a rich inner life.But blogging sure is fun, and I've \"met\" a bunch of really nice, interesting people doing it. And learned a lot of new things. So, thank you all, readers and fellow bloggers!OK, the hammer, nails, and spools of crochet thread are related to math projects by my daughter and her boyfriend, accomplished separately but together in this house, after a trip to Hobby Lobby. Beautiful string designs on blocks of wood.The meat tenderizer is for pork tenderloin sandwiches, eventually, yes more from the \"noble pig,\" or, as Homer Simpson calls it, that \"magical animal\" that is the source of everything he likes to eat. I love the noble pig's contribution to survival on the prairie and to medical science (insulin). Thank you, noble pig.I respect anyone's dietary restrictions against pork. (Don't read the bacon and chocolate/drunken goat cheese blog entry.) And against meat or red meat. I am gradually getting rid of red meat in my diet, and note that pork is advertised as \"the other white meat.\" Tonight's dinner is entirely roast vegetables! Including fresh asparagus!And I've been thinking about how the pounding life gives us can indeed tenderize us.Tenderly yours,Not Just My Blog"},

I did imagine a drunken goat, but I have enough brain cells left also to imagine the actual soaking process, which you can read about here, where drunken goat cheese is referred to as \"booze's best bud.\"Alas, the wine bar has closed, but last night, after the poetry reading, I discovered hot goat cheese balls at Reality Bites, a local tapas bar. Goat cheese balls are lightly rolled in breadcrumbs and served warm on a plate with honey and cayenne pepper.  Wonderful with 14 Hands merlot.Kim and I had gone carousing (on a Tuesday night, after a poetry reading at the local history museum, to give you a context for our kind of carousing), so we were recalling spiced nuts and other wine-associated pleasures, and that's why it is both Fat Tuesday and the Hump of the Week in the blog today.The reading went very well!  A big bunch of people came despite the morning's snow, including an old friend who now makes cheese!! The Ropp family also has field trips to help the kids of today know where milk and cheese really come from, and we know it's true that some kids are growing up somewhat detached from that knowledge.Many nice comments after the reading, plus the exciting news that Bill's daughter-in-law has a blog called Bacon and Chocolate.  In my desperate search for it this morning, I found instead  Noble Pig, a site that is \"...a little about food...a little about wine...and a lot about nothing,\" so, of course, I highly recommend it. And there you can find a recipe for bacon chocolate chip cookies. And there's also Chocolate University Online, where you can read about Scotch with chocolate covered bacon and other bacon & chocolate delights.Wikipedia covers chocolate and bacon, as well, including chocolate-covered bacon on a stick, for all of you meat-on-a-stick lovers out there.  (Or There's Something About Mary lovers.)I'm sure I'll talk about books again soon, but for now I'm waxing poetic about stuff you ought not to be eating, Lent or not.Update! Bacon and Chocolate found! And followed! She hasn't updated lately, but she's been busy. And you will enjoy the other food pix & recipes!"},
{"title": "Brave Old World", "date": "Tuesday, March 29, 2011", "text": "I finished Brave New World, by Aldous Huxley, last night, and will re-read it again before the shared inquiry discussion of it in late April at Great Books Chicago. I love shared inquiry, which works by way of interpretive questions and answers supported by evidence from the text.  We are all together in the adventure of discovery; we are equals, responsible and accountable for what we think and say, we talk only about the text, and we learn a lot from each other.  We are not being lectured to by an expert—neither a real expert (although I love listening to real experts at other kinds of events) nor a fake expert, male or female, who mansplains.A Great Books shared inquiry discussion is like going to a really good book group where everybody has actually read the book and will talk about it. Not about their work day, or how they got bogged in the middle of the book and went golfing and realized that Huxley was the same guy who took LSD in the 1960s, or how Oprah got poets to model the new spring fashions.I just realized it must be Cranky Doodle Day in the blog.And I just realized \"cranky doodles\" are a real thing, and people draw them and blog about them.  See A Bird on the Head for more wonderful cranky doodles, like \"Extremely Depressed Poop.\"Anyhoo, I did read the contextual material at the back of this particular paperback edition of Brave New World:—a  biographical essay, “Aldous Huxley: A Life of the Mind”—a summary of the critical reaction to the book, “Too Far Ahead of Its Time?: The Contemporary Response to Brave New World (1932)” (literary critics saw its shortcomings as a novel, and it has some, but it surely became a popular classic as social criticism, science fiction, and political philosophy)—A letter from Huxley to George Orwell, upon receiving 1984 from Orwell’s publisher in 1949—a list of Huxley’s publications, reminding me to get Point Counter Point and Eyeless in Gaza from the library someday, and to re-read Island, which is on one of my bookshelvesOK, Huxley did sound like a bit of a mansplainer in his letter to Orwell, telling him that the future will probably be more like his own description in Brave New World, based on the advances in hypnosis, and that “the ultimate revolution” with which 1984 concerns itself really has its roots in the actions and philosophy of the Marquis de Sade, etc.According to Wikipedia, Orwell suggested that Huxley must have been influenced in his dystopian vision by the novel We, by Yevgeny Zamyatin, but Huxley denied this. Orwell says 1984 was modeled on We, and Huxley says he wrote Brave New World in response to H.G. Wells. More re-reading and library visits to come, although I am afraid of the cover of We.I am happy to hear from all experts, science fiction readers, and, yes, mansplainers on the connections between these novels! As long as you’ve actually read them.In weather news, it’s snowing.  The brave old season, winter, has resumed, just in ironic time for The Architecture of Spring: A Poetry Reading in response to A Passion for Detail: The Architectural Legacy of A.

Pillsbury, tonight at 7:30 at the McLean County Museum of History.Thanks to Julie Kistler for covering it in her blog, A Follow Spot, where she gives biographical information about Pillsbury, the golfing architect.Until spring returns, I'm still with Ella, a Little Girl Blue."},

Willis (University of Iowa Press, 2005), first edition, first printing, new, shrink-wrapped!  Shakespeare is one of my favorite poets of all time, and In a Fine Frenzy includes poems by Marvin Bell, J. P. Dancing Bear, Kathleen Lynch, Charles Harper Webb, Eva Hooker, Cecilia Woloch, Ken Pobo, Sherod Santos, and many more (including me, which is why I have this extra copy!)Bonus gift: October, by Louise Gluck, Quarternote Chapbook Series #3 (Sarabande Books, 2004), first edition, saddle stapled.  Gluck is one of my favorites—especially her book The Wild Iris—and I have two copies of October because a poet friend gave me one for my birthday and I had at some point gotten myself a copy.  So I am keeping the gift and giving away this very gently used copy, along with the other 2 books.So, if you want to enter the drawing, leave a comment here with your name, and I will write it on a slip of paper and put it in a basket to draw out randomly in early May.  (Look for the winner announcement here in my blog on May 1, 2, or 3.) Once I announce the winner, he or she should then leave me a comment with mailing address (which I will record but not publish to the world), and I will send the books out that week!You can also comment on any post here during the month of April, leaving your name and saying you want to participate in the Poetry Giveaway, and I will put your name in the basket!"},
{"title": "Brave New World", "date": "Saturday, March 26, 2011", "text": "I'm now re-reading Brave New World, by Aldous Huxley, in this Harper Perennial Modern Classics edition with back cover blurb reminders that it is terribly pertinent still today. Ack, it is!It is a dystopian novel that first came out in 1932, but it does anticipate a world built on self-centered and money-based values we have now in a future he imagined, satirically, then.Workers and citizens tend not to have a say, as they are genetically engineered and socially predestined.I'm only on page 27 of this re-reading, having first read it in my teens--and will re-read again, as this, like Genesis and Willa Cather, is for shared-inquiry discussions with Great Books Chicago in April--but already I see shocking connections to now. \"A love of nature keeps no factories busy,\" says the Director of Hatcheries and Conditioning, explaining why babies are being taught to hate and fear roses.  \"It was decided to abolish the love of nature, but not the tendency to consume transport.\"  Nature is free.  Cars, gas, and other consumer goods keep the economy going.  Oh, yes, and time is figured as A.F. in the brave new world: After Ford. (It's all coming back to me now.)The society and the economy also run on: \"Standard men and women; in uniform batches.\" Alphas, Betas, Gammas, Deltas, and Epsilons, a biological class system, specifically: \"The principle of mass production at last applied to biology.\" People no longer live in small families with a \"mother\" and a \"father\" (now \"smut\" words) but are raised in appropriate groups according to society's needs.So it's icky and funny and makes you think and re-think. There are technologies Huxley couldn't predict--card files for record-keeping instead of computers--but it's a good way to think about drastic changes during his time, after one world war and just before another, and ours.Horribly, discussing the need to replenish the population to produce more workers after \"unforeseen wastages,\" Mr. Foster of the hatchery says, \"If you knew the amount of overtime I had to put in after the last Japanese earthquake!\"Moments like that in this book make me cringe. In addition, I now read it in the light of Never Let Me Go, by Kazuo Ishiguro, which both my mother and father (not smut words; instead, terms of respect and love!) have now read. And the Matrix movies.The Wikipedia article on Brave New World shows us the blue first edition cover and traces Huxley's inspirations and (disputed) influences, including that he \"found a book by Henry Ford on the boat to America.\" I love details like that, showing how what's at hand comes together in a piece of writing.And how the title comes from Shakespeare--Miranda exclaiming on the beauty of humans in The Tempest--and a Kipling poem that contains these lines:  And that after this is accomplished, and the brave new world begins / When all men are paid for existing and no man must pay for his sins...My husband came to bed last night, finding me immersed in Brave New World, with updates on the nuclear power plant in Japan. Alas, as great writers keep suggesting, the man who doesn't pay for his sins commits future generations to that awful debt."},

Sometimes I watch it just for fun.But a couple of times watching the slide show guidelines has actually resulted in me sending some poems, hoping to land a raw carrot in the brain of the poetry editor! (Makes actual sense if you watch the slide show.)Anyhoo, this last time it worked, and, despite my own harsh math challenge, I have 2 poems in issue #40: Harsh Mathematics, along with a bunch of other cool* poets, including a longtime favorite, Mather Schneider. *them, not me; I’m so not cool it sometimes burns a little.I think I once revealed to Mather my secret fantasy that I would get to ride in his taxi.

{"title": "Genesis on a Thursday", "date": "Thursday, March 24, 2011", "text": "I am re-reading Genesis in preparation for leading a discussion for Great Books Chicago: In the Beginning…in Chicago in April. I am always surprised by how quickly things happen in Genesis, by how many stories are jammed in there, and by how little specificity there is, except about who begat whom and how many years they all lived.Much of what I “remember” about those old stories comes from other people’s assumptions and interpretations. It’s good to go back to the text and see what’s there, and what isn't.Of course, Genesis coincides with Thor’s Day in the blog—thunder, justice, and vengeance galore. What I’d forgotten was all the Vagenda. No, really.  Chapter 16: Verses 1-2: Now Sarai Abram’s wife bare him no children: and she had an handmaid, an Egyptian, whose name was Hagar.And Sarai said unto Abram, Behold now, the LORD hath restrained me from bearing: I pray thee, go in unto my maid; it may be that I may obtain children by her.Well, he does, of course, and there is a child, a son, Ishmael.  But Sarai regrets her vagenda: My wrong be upon thee: I have given my maid into thy bosom; and when she saw that she had conceived, I was despised in her eyes.Uh oh.  Sounds like Hagar has her own vagenda.  Later (21:9), there is more “mocking” perceived by Sarah (renamed by God by now), and Hagar is sent into the wilderness.  Sarah’s vagenda is to protect her son Isaac as Abraham’s heir.[Painting by Adriaen van der Werff, Sarah Presenting Hagar to Abraham (public domain)]On and on it goes. There is water in the wilderness for Hagar, provided by an angel. Much good, and a terrible test, come to Abraham. And there will be two nations descending from these sons Isaac and Ishmael.  Turns out no woman’s vagenda really mattered back then.But I am also reading, for the same event, Willa Cather, “Tom Outland’s Story,” about discovering the ruins of a beautiful Indian cliff-dwelling civilization. Thunder here, too, on the mesa, and questions of justice and injustice.There is even a hammer, or the lack of one.  Tom Outland goes to Washington to try to interest government officials and members of the Smithsonian in preserving and studying the beautiful Cliff City. He encounters bureaucracy—its delays, incompetence, and self-interest.Then he is advised to take the Director to lunch—yes, on a Thursday!—but he hardly gets a word in edgewise. “I was amazed and ashamed that a man of fifty, a man of the world, a scholar with ever so many degrees, should find it worth his while to show off before a boy, and a boy of such humble pretensions, who didn’t know how to eat the hor d’oevres any more than if an assortment of cocoanuts had been set before him with no hammer.”Poor Tom has more to be “amazed and ashamed” of soon enough—and I find it important that he takes on what should be the Director’s own shame—but he also has a summer of happiness, living in the Cliff City.“Happiness is something one can’t explain. You must take my word for it. Troubles enough came afterward, but there was that summer, high and blue, a life in itself.”"},

{"title": "Happy Twosday", "date": "Tuesday, March 22, 2011", "text": "Happy Birthday to poet Billy Collins and lyricist Stephen Sondheim!  I love The Writer's Almanac, for its daily poems and birthday news. Today's poem is \"Forgetfulness,\" by Billy Collins, and you can read it there, hear it, or both, and it does trace the loss of memory and also, coincidentally, nods to the Supermoon.At Writer's Almanac, you can read brief stories of the development and careers of these two witty writers. Though Collins hung out with the Beat poets, he is identified now with charming domestic and \"suburban\" poems and often bashed by contemporary poets who are bored by his \"accessibility,\" a bad word among some poets.As for me, I enjoy accessible poems as well as less accessible poems, that need more unpacking, as they say, as long as there is something gripping there, something more than a virtuoso display of language or self.  As Collins says, \"I don't think people read poetry because they're interested in the poet. I think they read poetry because they're interested in themselves.\" So Collins, writing honestly as himself, addresses a real reader and thus escapes the trap of self.Mostly pleasant and unaffected in his poems, Collins allows himself some edge and annoyance in Ballistics, as if some of the criticism and negative opinion has gotten to him.  And wouldn't you know, this is a book people tend to like less? But I like that he can be as spiteful and petty, in spurts, as the rest of us. And he has a good answer to the charge of accessibility, too:\"I think clarity is the real risk in poetry because you are exposed. You're out in the open field. You're actually saying things that are comprehensible, and it's easy to criticize something you can understand.\"And, of course, hard to criticize something you can't understand. So it tends not to get criticized. That, or meaning itself is given up by critics and poets alike, something else elevated in its stead.Sondheim not only means, he rhymes! And does so with great sophistication and cleverness in songs that revolutionized musical comedy, using while twisting the prevailing conventions.I wish I could say the two-pound weights were pertinent. They are not to suggest either writer is a lightweight. Nor to suggest that I am using 2-pound weights in my exercise class. I have shifted to 3-pound weights. Do you think that will make me a more muscular writer?"},

But nuclear disasters have a manmade component. We always have another choice. I won't get into arguments here about energy sources, but, as the human community, we always have choices on how to generate and use energy. We can choose to close down nuclear power plants, as Germany did. We can choose better safety regulations and oversight agencies for existing plants, as the United States recently didn't. We can choose to build no more. We can choose to use less energy, and/or to make more efficient use of energy.We can choose to put human energy into innovations that do not harm the land and its creatures, including us humans. So often, \"we\" don't make that choice, and \"we\" know perfectly well why.I won't speak for anyone else, but I will vote and act according to my choices on this. And I hope we will come together at least as far as 1) helping Japan 2) changing our practices enough to avoid similar disasters in the future. You can choose your own charity or private/public action.My dad was laying out his ethical system (again) when I visited him Monday, and it is based on choice. (I grew up on this.) Any government or individual or boss that takes all choice away from its citizens, fellow individuals, or employees is using its power unethically in my interpretation of my dad's system. Working out the details and complexities is important, of course, but you can easily see that the boss taking away the employees' collective bargaining option is unethical in this system, and you can see from protests in the U.S. that many workers agree.I stopped watching 24 for many reasons, but mostly because Kiefer Sutherland kept saying, \"I had no choice\" to justify doing whatever he wanted to do. (He had a choice, and he made it. Why say he didn't?) I kept watching the original Star Trek for many reasons, but partly because Captain Kirk kept insisting there was another choice, even in a really tough spot.And, hey, just because stuff went wrong out of the blue for Maxwell doesn't mean he should bang other people on the head with his silver hammer.You can hear or read this fabulous poem, \"The Beatles,\" by Dorianne Laux, at The Writer's Almanac.If you want to see Steve Martin as Maxwell Edison, crazed plastic surgeon from the film Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, starring the Bee Gees and Peter Frampton, there are many clips to choose from at Youtube.And I don't think it's right to be a serial killer, but I am fascinated by Dexter, who is trying to work out his own, er, ethical system. Maybe someday he will put away his silver tools for good."},

After 9/11 he was troubled by nightmares of people jumping from burning buildings. Sometimes he was one of them. So he's taking Japan to heart, too, as so many of us are.But I did go out yesterday, early and on time, and it turned out to be my last day on my new, perfect job, which is as it should be, as this was by nature temporary and part-time, and maybe my favorite job** ever (!), so my morning sadness seemed a bit premonitory in retrospect, as premonitions...are.**as International Woman of MysteryIt may not surprise you that I am reading Cloud Atlas, by David Mitchell, which is 1) nonlinear 2) interrupted 3) soon to be a major motion picture.So now I need a new job and have started/continued to think about college teaching again, which has so many joys to it, and summers off, but tends to drain me of lots of the energy I need for writing. Shared dilemma of so many writer/teachers.In my stumbling around to get through this hump of the week, I also found another Cloud Atlas, with a World War II setting, by Liam Callanan. Everything's coming up Japanese weather balloons.Finally, today, there were good things! Blue sky, faint clouds. And I posted the new poetry feature, by Risa Denenberg, at Escape Into Life. I find her spare lyricism bracing and healing, wounded and fragile, all at the same time.And the images, stark but beautiful, are overhead views quite different from the overhead views we have been seeing of Japan. I can't explain how this all fits together, but you see it does. And I do sort of understand why I kept mistyping and got Cloud Atlast.  But really I'm glad to see the sun at last!"},

{"title": "Real Help", "date": "Monday, March 14, 2011", "text": "Imaginary Playlist:\"Blue\"--Joni Mitchell\"Blue Lips\"--Regina Spektor\"You May Be Right\"--Billy JoelThis weekend, like many of you, I spent time reflecting on Japan, reading news accounts, viewing photos and videos, hearing radio interviews, and reading some personal, eyewitness accounts. I alternated this with daily, familial joys and the usual duties and chores, feeling intensely my human responsibility to live on and live joyfully, somehow a way to honor those lost in the midst of their own joyful lives.Plus church, which provided more reflective time, on the topic of mercy.  \"Blessed are the merciful...\"You know how you often find mean, annoying anonymous comments after online news stories? Here and there, of course, someone angrily says something along the lines of \"No prayers, please! Real help is needed.\" (Or money. Always a good stand-in for real help. To erase the hint of sarcasm there, money does pay for real help and supplies.)I have to confess, I don't pray. Not in one traditional sense, of asking a personal God for help. I do ask for help--from actual people, and in a huge open-ended plaintive way. So, if God is a person, ze* can hear. But God is not a person for me; it is the name we give to What Is. This idea of what God is honors all religions (and atheism and agnosticism) and does not put them in conflict, but only in my little mind. Clearly, in the world, they are still in conflict. (But I may be right. Or I may be crazy.)I must also confess that I send good vibrations out into the universe whenever anyone asks. Recently, I sent healing energies to my sister and her family in Ohio. I paused in the middle of the day, upon reading emails from my sister-in-law in Santa Cruz, to send vibrating sighs of relief and hope to the people connected to her company in Japan, rippling out to everyone. This may not be \"real help,\" but I continue to do it.I hope to find ways of really helping the world in this situation and others. I think there are dark shared times yet to come, related to the pollution and fallout from this particular disaster and to our continued habits on the earth. But right now Japan needs real help, urgent and particular, and I see our world coming together to give it, in whatever ways we can.*gender-neutral pronounBirds again, from Pamela Callahan."},
{"title": "Daylight Volley Time", "date": "Sunday, March 13, 2011", "text": "I remembered to spring forward on the upstairs clock, and I saw a lot of springing forward at the 7th grade state volleyball tournament yesterday, so I am giving you the heads up: there may be sports analogies. My brother-in-law, a dancer & choreographer, finds sports analogies annoying when applied to art, and I have met people who hate them in a classroom. Fortunately, ignorant as I am about most sports, I don't use many. But I was pondering networking in terms of school volleyball, and it helped me illustrate a point in my own nitpicky little head. Alas, that humorous adjective is too close for comfort, as nits are exactly what you'd want to pick off your head, but here goes.I've been pondering a good discussion of networking in the blog of Sandy Longhorn--its virtues, its attendant doubts--in the context of sending your writing to magazines where you know the editor, or being asked to send work, and how this parallels job networking, applying for a job where you know someone. I understand that, these days, most jobs really are had by networking, not by answering newspaper ads or filling out the online application form, but I continue to be troubled by a world that works primarily because of \"who you know.\" That aspect still seems smarmy somehow.Lest I be misunderstood (see yesterday), I am all for the generosity of recommending people to each other (in workplace or literature) because they do good work and are not too flaky to handle the job requirements, editorial deadline, etc. I'm fine with the boss's son being hired in a position of responsibility, if he can handle it, and eventually taking over the company! That's part of why his dad founded the business, right?The only part I don't like is somebody getting the job because she knows someone if she's not really the best person for the job. Somebody else was; she applied, too, but the friend of a friend got it. This has not happened to me, but it happens around me, and it disturbs the nits, who raise a ruckus. (I should have warned you of the lice analogy, too.)  Anyhoo...Let's say a girl has played volleyball since grade school, learned her position well, been a real team player, played freshman and junior varsity in high school, practiced hard, cheered from the bench when she was not a starter junior year, because it was a senior's turn to start, and comes to tryouts her own senior year, and someone new has moved into the district who is trying out for the same position.  Let's say, middle hitter. Now the girl knows she will have to compete for the position, and that's fine.  But let's say the new girl is the daughter of a friend of the coach, and it turns out the coach told her friend what neighborhood to move into to be sure to come to this high school, and now the coach puts the new girl in as a starter even though she is not as good as the first girl! This has the specificity of gossip, but I assure you I am making it up. (I write short stories, too.) This is the kind of networking I don't like.Caring for the area volleyball players is on my mind because of all the great playing, good team spirit, and heartfelt commitment I saw yesterday. Great spirit on the floor, great spirit on the bench, and good matches. Good referees, too, which helps the spirit in the gym! May the best teams win Tuesday night at the championship, and I hope I get to see it.  My husband and daughter will be playing in their adult league, where my daughter is now a substitute for someone who can't come for a couple weeks, and that's not really a spectator situation, so I might go to the 7th grade finals on my own.

{"title": "Miss Understanding", "date": "Saturday, March 12, 2011", "text": "How I love the blog Confessions of Ignorance, where Seana Graham is \"Correcting My Limitless Lack of Knowledge, One Post at a Time.\" She keeps me from many a parlous mistake, although, alas, I go on and make many mistakes of my own. Hoping to be tactful, compassionate, and kind, I have too often in life said the wrong thing...or, the other side of this coin, been heard wrong. If my legacy were to be remembered as Miss Understanding, well, that, too, would be heard wrong.I remember working on a board, hoping to solve a sticky personnel problem, and reassuring a colleague that I was \"a pretty politic person\" and could probably handle it.  I meant \"politic\" in its political philosophy context, as judicious and having to do with the group's existing policy, looking out for the body politic, doing what's wise for the whole group, with connotations of prudence and being a good citizen. I later realized my colleague heard instead connotations of being \"political\" in the glad-handing, shrewd sense, saying what needs to be heard to get something done expediently, the cunning sense. The icky feeling of being misunderstood was compounded by the realization that somehow I had confessed to being worse than I probably am.The ickiness increased when this same person asked me, when I was moving to a small town from the big city of Chicago, if it was to be \"a big fish in a small pond.\" I couldn't answer at first, astonished by the tactlessness of this, and how it had so little to do with our decisions to scale back, live at a slower pace, raise the kids near my parents, and send them to public school. My status in the community was not a concern; feeling part of a community was indeed a goal.After a short silence, I said, in seeming complicity, \"I guess so,\" which is what I always say now when what I must mean is, \"I guess that is the way you see it, yes.\" My friend and colleague could only see me through the filter of her own literary ambition.So it was with understanding, delight, and a parlous background feeling of vindication that I learned that poet Arielle Green Bywater (Given) is leaving her fulltime job in Chicago and moving back to Belfast, Maine, where she will feel part of a community that already loves and welcomes her, and live with her family a simpler life. I sense it is a whole-life decision, a  choice to live according to principles and beliefs, and it helps me understand her poem \"This is to Find Out About Something\" in the book Brute Neighbors in a whole new way. Her poem ends, \"Do not end with the wind or grey / that is the name Chicago.\"And now I send you to parlous, part 2, Seana's account of a particular misunderstanding involving Santa Cruz, and her sense of the \"Pacific being just a small pool.\"And I send myself off to enjoy the sunshine and blue sky of this day, and the junior high state volleyball tournament, the joys and pleasures of my little life on this earth in this community, while they are here. They might not be here by 2:45 p.m., as many in Japan suddenly learned in the midst of their daily lives."},
{"title": "Les Fleurs du mal", "date": "Friday, March 11, 2011", "text": "Yesterday I had the pleasure of attending a retrospective poetry reading by James McGowan, who graced us with a few poems from each decade of his long career.  He is the translator of Charles Baudelaire's Les Fleurs de Mal (The Flowers of Evil), from Oxford University Press, and re-released as one of the Oxford World's Classics. (I've linked you to Amazon, but locals can probably find a fine copy at Babbitt's!) He read from this sexy edition, but you'll see another cover below.Jim organized the reading by decade, starting with a few poems from the 1960s, and incorporating some translations along with his own work (including a collaborative translation from a German poet! Why didn't I write stuff down? Enthralled, I guess.)  He had a perfect balance of humor and seriousness. For example, he revealed that the only poem he's written since 2010 is a limerick...and he'd spare us that. (Of course, now I want to hear it.)And he left us, somehow, gazing at a universe of stars and listening to the breathing of whales.I'm delighted to report that Jim used the two-poem warning--in fact, a three-poem warning--something I recently read about at Voice Alpha, a site devoted to advice and support on reading poetry aloud.  He began, \"I have two more poems from...and then one more poem,\" and made the audience laugh with \"only three more poems to go,\" but we were perfectly content!There were other poets in the audience. So lovely to see John Knoepfle, whom I had also heard read on the Illinois Wesleyan campus, though in the new Ames Library, and Lucia Getsi, who had returned from retirement in the South for this event in central Illinois. Poet Jim Plath introduced his colleague. Kathryn Kerr, of Turtles All the Way Down was there, and Kirstin Hotelling Zona, the new editor of Spoon River Poetry Review.  A plethora of poets, an abundance of love.  And a fine turnout from the community, as well.  A roomful of joy and appreciation, for the flowers of evil."},

Let the people be heard, and let this wonderful change in our country happen without violence.Oh, I do hope we can find a way to work together in cooperation and collaboration, with fair wages and salaries, living wages and salaries, health care for all. Why can't we? We've been a proud, industrialized country for years, admired for our freedoms and our working democracy, a haven for so many. Why fall down now into a land of petty mini-tyrants? And greed.  Well, alas, we know why. The money and power question always answers itself. It's the \"business as usual\" answer.Still, I think we are more creative than that. I think we can find solutions, shift to sustainable living (to use the new jargon), and be proud of ourselves again. It will mean providing and encouraging real education, not teaching to tests. It will mean real American workmanship again, not manufacturing intentionally disposable products. It will mean supporting a real economy, not an economy that depends on endless consumption of intentionally disposable \"goods\" many of which are bad for us (bad foods, products made with toxic materials, etc.) Sigh...I'm not a journalist, politician, nor political pundit, but it is Thor's Day in the blog. So I am shouting out with the protester.Now I will stand up in my own field and sing out some good fortune:--3 poems in the new blossombones, just out--by coincidence, in sparkling white against a black abyss--2 poems out soon (April) in Right Hand Pointing, a hilarious place to do business--a poem in the new issue of After Hours--a poem in the new issue of Ekphrasis (poems about paintings)--a poem in the new (print) issue of Burnt Bridge--work forthcoming in Adanna and Poetry East--work in the anthologies Brute Neighbors (just out) and Solace in So Many Words (soon to be out)Sometimes I wonder if I am speaking out enough, but I see I have been doing my own proper work and speaking in my quiet but steady voice all along.

This puts me on the same, strict diet my brother is on: no more books till you read the unread books you already have. One of the books I already have is The Springhouse, by Joyce Wilson, and today I read it straight through.The book opens and closes with the springhouse, literally, a title poem and then \"The Springhouse in Winter,\" to end the book as the year ends, with all kinds of life in between: natural life--poems about chickens, a fox, tadpoles, hoar frost, the brook, a spittle bug, a walking stick, and a dead bee--and poems about family life, which include trouble and grief.But, in honor of Ash Wednesday, I'll share with you a favorite (in which family and nature mix):The Ash TreeTo reach so wide, it must have been alonefor a long time and in an open field.Our mother walked an old hemp rope aroundthe trunk of the ash tree and marked it,and then we spread the rope out on the lawnto measure just how much our love had grownin the ten years since she had counted lengthswith him, our father died, and we had moved.Ten years since she had wrapped her arms around--!It showed an increase of eleven feet.We got the car to take us back to townand left the tree, our house, and our old street.I love the simplicity of that first couplet, and seeing the tree there alone, which I can do thanks to the title. Other poems in this book contain lots of true rhyme, even rhyming couplets, and well-used slant rhyme, but I like the subtle and mere echoes of rhyme in this poem--how \"alone,\" \"lawn, \"grown,\" and \"town\" ring together like church bells, how \"around\" is repeated, how \"feet\" and \"street\" make the poem end on a rhyme.I like how the nostalgia here is restrained.I love learning things from poems and poets.  I learned from poet Richard Jones that ashes are good for the garden.  I learned from Joyce Wilson how love can and can't be measured.To learn more about Ash Wednesday from a poet, take a look at Kristin Berkey-Abbott's blog entry on it.

A few chocolate-covered raisins and cashews.  As a breakfast, that's not so bad. Cashews are evidently so good for our teeth that a cashew toothpaste has been in development for some time, but, ew....)On my way home, I stopped by the Borders store closing sale, and, yes, here began the real indulgence, and perhaps I will now have to give up something for Lent. Books. Not reading them, of course, just buying them. It makes perfect sense. Don't buy another book, no matter how good the sale price, until I read all the unread books in the house. And then, like so many sensible people, go to the library.Already, I quibble with myself: What about the books already in my cart at Amazon, that I can get free with the coupon that comes when I pay my credit card bill? Nope. Wait till after Easter.Sigh...So, at Border's I allowed myself three Christmas items drastically reduced: a box of beautiful Japanese bird cards and the Tori Amos and Pink Martini Christmas CDs, to wean myself off James Taylor and the Trans-Siberian Orchestra at Christmastime. I had just filled my latest personal journal, which is why I went to the Borders sale in the first place, and the nicest journal left was the Desire journal, with lock and key, that has steamy quotations in it. I can write with that.And the books I got were the ones I told myself this about: \"If these happen to be on the shelf, I will get them.

{"title": "What is Writing?!", "date": "Monday, March 7, 2011", "text": "I am still reading Gourmet Rhapsody, by Muriel Barbery, a perfect book to be reading on the Blue Monday before the actual Fat Tuesday, let me tell you. And I'm not even Catholic, nor planning to give up anything for Lent.  Certainly not the Chocolate & Nut Frenzy array I got to serve to the Poetry Someday workshop I now teach at my kitchen table! (But what you see above is a Charlotte Russe.)Last night I was even inspired by the book to watch Ratatouille, thinking it might somehow be a vague, uncredited source material for the film, which sometimes happens...but I have enjoyed reading about Ratatouille in Wikipedia and I applaud the on-the-scene research done by all those who made the film!Of course, I fell asleep in the middle, so I will be watching it again, little by little, and as I continue to read the book. And will simply make mental notes of the remarkable coincidences.Anyhoo, I was struck by this passage:  \"What is writing, no matter how lavish the pieces, if it says nothing of the truth, cares little for the heart, and is merely subservient to the pleasure of showing one's brilliance?\" Exactly!The narrator of this section of Gourmet Rhapsody is reflecting on his work as a food critic and on the excellence of the tomato, but his words (which are of course the words of Muriel Barbery, a writer) apply to imaginative literature as well.We could ask, \"But who can know the truth?\" and yet we know our personal truths and can be honest about those. Caring for the heart, to me, means caring for the hearts of others, not just my own. I wonder about this any time I read a virtuoso poem somewhere, enjoying it like a cream-filled, gloriously rich pastry. Afterwards, I remember nothing of it; it was a momentary delight, did not nourish me beyond the moment. Did it set up a craving? Not even that, in most cases. Will I enjoy the pleasure of such a pastry again? Yes, a thousand times, yes!And so I do not judge the poem, nor write a critical review of the sort that Anton Ego writes in Ratatouille, the kind that can remove a star from a restaurant rating. I guess I simply note that this poem is a luscious dessert, and I will read others for sustenance."},

We were in regulated traffic, steady but slow, occasional stop and go, and eventually we passed the trouble, nothing awful, a row of cars bumped.When one is done, I wonder--is there not another?\"It's a teenager,\" said my daughter.And then, if God is willing, perhaps we are neighbors again.We got home safely, and I fed everyone. Life's fragility makes me grateful for each safe return, every meal.I cannot tell how Eternity seems. It sweeps around me like a sea.My folks got home safely from their two weeks in Florida yesterday, too.  I had taken the moldy stuff out of their fridge and checked their house in the morning, before the brake light came on.  Most clocks were on, but the stove clock was flashing, and the microwave clock off, so the power must have flickered, probably during the hailstorm last weekend.And this world is such a little place, just the red in the sky, before the sun rises.And now the dear sweet husband tells me, \"Your brakes are OK.\" It was the brake fluid, he refilled it, and in the spring he will replace the brake pads.

I stared at the draft in progress.  I stared at a previous draft. I copied and pasted chunks of both into a new document. I deleted a bit.

Pretty random, huh?Then K-- called to say I should go ahead and have lunch as the incompetence appeared to be interminable, and she'd had to step out to a 7-11 for a candy bar, where the counter clerk was blinded by her beauty, shielding his eyes in a swift motion as she tried to pay.  \"Oh, were you blinded by my beauty?!\" she asked (using my own characteristic punctuation).It turned out to be a sudden migraine, but he went along with it, and I went along to the Park Grill in Millennium Park, noticing the ice skaters but not the SWAT Team.I got a table, asked if I could linger, which was fine as long as I was going to order lunch, and alerted the staff that I might be joined but probably not, when lo and behold K-- called, and lunch together was possible, and I gave her walking directions, stood up and waved in the window, perhaps drawing the attention of the SWAT Team as well as the wait staff, and K-- found her way to me, and we had fabulous salads. And I ate a lot of bread.  Proof of hunger.K-- pointed out the SWAT Team and their binoculars and guns. They were either in training for a possible incident or avid winter bird watchers.On the way home in the car, I read her a story from the current issue of The Sun, one of my favorite magazines, called \"World Enough and Time,\" by Linda McCullough Moore, a phrase that many other writers have been fond of, including Robert Penn Warren, who used it as a title for a novel (and titles cannot be copyrighted). The story made me sob, and I couldn't read the last paragraph, so we watched the rain a while, she made a call in to her workplace, and so on, until I got it together and read the ending through the lump in my throat.The phrase \"world enough, and time\" comes from the opening line of \"To His Coy Mistress,\" by Andrew Marvell, which also contains the phrase, \"Time's winged chariot hurrying near,\" which, indeed, it is.The moral of the poem is let's do it while we can! Let's do!"},

Or to workplaces where everyone kept getting laid off, and there was an atmosphere of fear. We noticed how this novel was set in the downturn just before 9/11, as was The Cookbook Collector, by Allegra Goodman, another book we’d read together, and how now we’re in another one.We also noticed the “we” narrator of the Ferris book, though Pam noticed it “ramping up” as she got to the end, when she first realized it, and started flipping the pages back to see if it had been a “we” or community voice all along.  It had, except for one important interlude!I think the only other community voice I’ve read before is in the short story “A Rose for Emily” by William Faulkner.  Does anyone know of another whole novel written in community voice?That’s it for Random Coinciday.  You’d think I’d have more.You can add stuff.  More song titles with days of the week, for instance."},

Or reading.  But I always have to look it up. Back to The Anatomy of Melancholy:My eye first fell upon Subsection 7--Envy, Malice, Hatred...as causes of melancholy, and I skimmed a bit here, finding Burton quoting Felix Platurus noting, Envy so gnaws many men's hearts, that they become altogether melancholy.  Shortly thereafter the phrase the rotting of the bones arrested me, and the last sentence on that page begins, \"It crucifies their souls, withers--\" One hesitates to turn the page, eh?So I didn't.  I looked higher on the page, and found the phrase, \"Odds bodkins!\" uttered in connection with \"many base, impudent, brazen-faced rogues, that will be moved with nothing, take no infamy or disgrace to heart, laugh at all....\"  Yes, the kind of person who would say, \"God's body!\" as an oath, instead of \"Odds bodkins!\" to temper it, make it less offensive, and so on.  (Hmm, even Shakespeare had to learn this, according to The Phrase Finder.) Or the kind of person who would indeed say the softened oath, and move on.  Burton dismisses them handily in Subsection 6--Shame and Disgrace.And here, on page 228, I learn the shocking news that Aristotle died of shame. Wait, maybe I had heard that in the past, and dismissed it as unlikely, or a legend. Burton says that shame and disgrace cause some people to \"melancholize in corners, and keep in holes.\" Note to self, and to groundhog: come out, come out! It's March, and spring will come later this month! The sun is shining, but there's no need to fear one's own shadow! Some comfort: \"The most generous souls are most subject to it.\"And that's when he drops the A-Bomb: \"Aristotle, because he could not understand the motion of Euripus, for grief and shame drowned himself.\"OK, Euripus is a strait with wild tidal currents (that anyone might drown in) and Wikipedia tells me that its motions were not fully described and understood till the 20th century, so Aristotle need not have felt so ashamed!  Wikipedia also tells me that Aristotle probably died of natural causes after leaving Athens to avoid angry feelings aimed at philosophers, especially those who had tutored Alexander the Great, who also had a beef with Aristotle later in life.  Oh, those ancient politicians hated intellectuals, too!Anyhoo, legend and Wikipedia report that Aristotle fled saying, \"I will not allow Athens to sin twice against philosophy,\" meaning he didn't want to suffer the same fate as Socrates, arrested for \"corrupting the young\" by sharing his ideas, but then why do some say that Aristotle also took poison (as Socrates did, in prison)?  Well, it's just as likely, then, that Aristotle did die of shame, or stress, or a mix of emotions.  Natural causes in a generous, sensitive, hard-working soul. Odds bodkins! That can happen!But I hoped to provide another option, for what to do with shame, and suffering, in my tiny (3 1/2 line) poem, \"Red Nasturtium.\""},

{"title": "Cranky Doodle Two", "date": "Monday, February 28, 2011", "text": "I was on the train this morning at the time I usually blog, coming home from the Oscar party in Chicago and finishing The Elegance of the Hedgehog, by Muriel Barbery.  Oh, how I love the mixed crankiness, tolerance, melancholy, and sweet joy of Renee Michel, and the yearning for meaning of Paloma Josse, and the acute intelligence of both these characters.  I recommend this book to anyone who doesn't mind pausing to philosophize or to examine grammar & usage before the story resumes.  It's worth the wait.Madame Michel gets a bit cranky when the upper classes look down on the lower classes, and when the rich and powerful cannot even imagine that \"ordinary little people\" might have thoughts in their heads or a sensitivity to beauty. \"Who has ever heard of a maid and a concierge making use of their afternoon break to ponder the cultural significance of interior decoration?\"When she continues in her meditation, I am sure I am one of the \"ordinary little people,\" though firmly in the middle class in the USA.  \"You would be surprised by what ordinary little people come out with.  They may prefer stories to theories, anecdotes to concepts, images to ideas--that doesn't stop them from philosophizing.\" I am an ordinary person, so, yes, I prefer stories, anecdotes, and images, and a poet, so I prefer the concrete to the abstract, but there is a place for all of it, and this book pursues that, too.Another thing that makes Madame and me cranky is what is overly academic or wasted intellectualism.  She respects the great mind, of course, just as I respect the erudition and prose style of historian and academic Marilynne Robinson, but she is impatient with the usual course of the academic's career. Looking over a student's thesis, she sees it as \"a perfect illustration of the way the university works: if you want to make a career, take a marginal, exotic text...that is relatively unexplored, abuse its literal meaning by ascribing to it an intention that the author himself had not been aware of (because, as we all know, the unknown in conceptual matters is far more powerful than any conscious design), distort that meaning to the point where it resembles an original thesis..., burn all your icons while you're at it [and here she lists the personal icons of the student writer], devote a year of your life to this unworthy little game [and here Madame Michel resumes the story and her own sharp humor, having been roused before her work day officially began by the rich girl student who treats her like a servant and whose father can afford a courier] at the expense of a collectivity whom you drag from their beds at seven in the morning, and send a courier to your research director.\"Of course, living down to the expectations of the upper classes, Madame Michel also removes the paper from the unsealed couriered envelope and reads it, and later accepts a dress not her own from the drycleaner.  Ah, well, but we all have our flaws and the price is dearly paid. (Read the book!)The cover of my book (see above) is blue, and I'm a little blue that I was bumped twice by people flinging their bags around and spilled coffee on it.  But at least I spilled coffee on my own and not the red-covered Gourmet Rhapsody, also by Muriel Barbery, same characters, same residential hotel, the first novel, happening before The Elegance of the Hedgehog, which I borrowed from the Oscar party hostess! So now you know what I'll be reading next!And the elegance of the rooster comes from Nashville Scene, where you can visit the Red Rooster and the Blue Rooster restaurants...."},
{"title": "Cranky Doodle Day", "date": "Sunday, February 27, 2011", "text": "Tonight I am going to an Oscar party, woefully unprepared to vote because I have not seen enough of the nominated films, not even Toy Story 3, which has been around for a while, and which everyone tells me is wonderful and will make me cry.I have seen:True GritThe Kids Are All RightThe King’s SpeechInceptionI could be cranky with myself for not having seen more of the Oscar nominees before Oscar night, or I could accept that it will be cheaper to get them from the library and it won’t hurt my ears so much, as movie theatres are really, really loud these days. I’ll just be cranky about that. And about the commercials, for cars and tv shows, that turn up among the movie previews and concession stand jingles nowadays.But enough of that.  I am very much enjoying The Elegance of the Hedgehog, by Muriel Barbery, in the voices of a 12-year-old girl and a 54-year-old French concierge autodidact philosopher. I had to look up the word “loge” which I had always thought of as a theatre box (see Renoir painting above) but which is also a sort of compartment, apparently, where the concierge lives, inside the elegant residential hotel, with a door easily accessible to the public.  “Loge” can also mean “lodge,” and thus a dwelling, not just a kiosk or box. But, in random coincidii mode, it is also the name of a moon of the planet Saturn and the Swedish or Germanized name, Loge, of the Norse God Loki.  The gods Saturn and Thor appeared in my blog posts this past week.  As a compartment or area of theatre seating (also the front rows of the mezzanine), it is pronounced lozh. As a natural satellite or person, it has 2 syllables, and the \"g\" is not softened by a \"z\" sound.I am making these distinctions and clarifications so Madame Michel, the French concierge, a fictional character who is deeply offended by the misuse of a comma, won’t get cranky with me.And, so Lorel J won’t get cranky with me, I credit her with the actual Crafty Doodle Day on which Cranky Doodle Day is based. Lorel puts Crafty Doodle Day to much better use, such as an elegant light switch cover she made herself! But we are building up anticipation for the book purse party, yes?!"},

They were comfortable, OK?Those of you who have read the Bridget Jones books will recall that Helen Fielding uses \"sluttish\" to mean careless washing up (see the Wikipedia article!).

{"title": "If I Had a Hammer", "date": "Friday, February 25, 2011", "text": "I told you I might have a non-linear week.  On Thursday, I wrote about Jorie Graham, making it Poetry Someday, and on Friday, today, it's Thor's Day.  Thursday really is named for Thor, the Norse god of thunder, a guy who wields a hammer. Unfortunately in this painting he seems to be wielding it on humans and horned goats, rather than using it for good.But I've been flailing around for a name for the day I might rant, and I've tossed out Petty Peeves as I don't really want to be petty or peevish.  There are better things to do with one's time and energy, like build a cool bookcase. If I rant, I want it to be funny, so it might go into the Hump of the Week. But I'm human, not a god or a stand-up comic, so I might fail at all of this, and flail some more.As to the Wasteful Love aspect, the Throwaway idea, love so plentiful we can fling it around, well, yes, but neither of those names quite works.So, for the nonlinear time being, Thor's Day it is, a weird catchall for stuff I love or stuff I might be tempted to complain about, right before smacking myself in the middle of the forehead with a rubber hammer for being so petty.For instance, yesterday, there was Jorie Graham, wrapped in scarves, casual among the formally robed academics milling about before the convocation at Wesleyan, walking up on stage to clear her area of the water bottle, notes, et cetera that she had placed there by her chair, kindly contributing to the formality, leaving the stage bare before the rituals and music and words that would fill it...and nothing to complain about, but I didn't know how to interpret her actions till afterwards, after hearing her, after placing them in the context. A petty complainer might have seen her 1) drawing attention to herself and/or 2) disturbing the formality by picking up the items 3) she shouldn't have left there in the first place, and 4) I have made many a petty assumption like that in my past, alas, and/or 5) sat beside people who make them.Likewise, soon all the academics file in down the two aisles of the auditorium, in their robes and hoods of colors that mean something specific (where they were educated, what degrees) and among them is Jorie, with a paper cup of strong coffee, and all the items she previously removed from the stage, dressed as before in layers and scarves, not formal academic robes, though she is a major formal academic at Harvard.  I am just watching, noticing, sifting, not judging, yes, categorizing a bit (as in classical rhetoric), but not forming any particular opinions (what have I got as evidence for any opinion yet?), just feeling a bit apprehensive about whether this will all be too formal and intellectual and academic to mean anything to me, one of the assembled masses. (I've worn robes, too, but I cringe a bit at long-winded introductions, if that helps convey a part of my apprehension.) An onstage organist is playing Bach. We remain standing for the invocation.And then?!: everything is sweet, everyone is plainspoken, students perform in a brass quintet, and Jorie Graham blows me away with her call to empathy.  No need for apprehension, in its meaning of petty fear, dread, foreboding; only for apprehending, in its meaning of understanding.And that's Thor, above, in layers, being dressed as a woman, a bride, in an elaborate prank to fool a guy who has demanded the goddess Freya as his wife and stolen Thor's hammer as a way to get her. Although it's a comic poem, it's not going to end well (see humans and goats above). So, on Thor's Day, I might rant and rave, I might rage against the man or the machine, but I will hope to do it humorously, in love, and aiming for a better understanding, so I don't break anything with my hammer."},
{"title": "Jorie Graham", "date": "Thursday, February 24, 2011", "text": "Yesterday I went to hear Jorie Graham speak at the Founders' Day Convocation at Illinois Wesleyan University.  Wow!It was a call to empathy. A powerful, honest, sometimes funny, humble and humbling speech. She wants those of us who grew up with empathy to reawaken and exercise it, to walk out in the world again and know it, cherish it.  She wants those of us who are growing up on technology to realize there's a real world, not just a virtual one, again by walking out in it.She wants us to have empathy for future generations we will never see; we must imagine them in order to feel for them, of course, so we will be exercising our imaginative as well as our empathic parts to do so. She told us that the part of the brain sparked by empathy is the same part sparked by information received at the tips of our fingers.  (Nancy, your reading on the brain, learning, and Braille connects to this, yes?) It's as if our fingertips are an insect's feelers or a cat's whiskers, alerting us to what's all around, helping us to function, warning us of danger. Graham wants us to put our fingertips out metaphorically into the future, with empathy, so we don't with our actions now make it horrendous for our descendants, if there are any, then.Will we be satisfied with cute animal pictures on the Internet, she asked.  What about the real animals? Likewise, the Disneyfied world of animated animals.  What about their real lives on the real earth?  Yes, she was asking us to reconsider what we value and make sure we care for and appreciate what we have, so we don't ruin it.  An environmental call to \"arms,\" asking us to embrace our world and our task, which will be to change our behavior.Atlanta ran out of water, she said, and asked Mississippi for some. Mississippi said no. The federal government had to step in. We are already saying no to our fellow humans, in our own country, she was pointing out, and already using up our natural resources. We must change.This is all summary and paraphrase, mixed with my own interpretation and examples. I hope she will publish the speech somewhere (the college paper?) and/or that essays of this ilk are out there for you to find and read, and her poems certainly are plentiful and available.  I have The Dream of the Unified Field, her Pulitzer Prize-winning Selected Poems, 1974-1994, which I will return to now, galvanized by this speech.At the end of her speech, she read 5 poems, not her own (which will interest the Voice Alpha people!), about human empathy. I confess they made me cry, even though I had read them before, in that gasping, OMG-not-in-public kind of way. But it was OK: semi-dark auditorium, shared empathy, we were/are all in it together.She read the poems from the page, in a voice like talking, as they were projected behind her on a large screen, so we could read them, too, white letters on a black background, stimulating two main parts of the brain!

In my last part time job, Wednesday was my day off, so I had a little valley mid-week, in which to loll around and handle chores, errands, and medical appointments.In my blog, Wednesday often became a similar catch-all or hodge podge.  And I do hope it mostly has a humorous or fun feel henceforth. Or shall I say humpforth? (This is why you don't want me to do stand up.)But the Libyan people are on my mind, their protests not going so well as those of the Egyptian people. And the people of Christchurch, New Zealand, their daily lives toppled by an earthquake.  All over the world everyday, someone is struggling with some awful reality. It makes me all the more grateful for my little life, and its littler humps.And for the Tootsie Roll.  I read about it today in Garrison Keillor's Writer's Almanac as \"America's first individually wrapped penny candy,\" as of today in 1896, a chocolate candy almost anybody could afford (not just rich people). Now it's true, then, that the Tootsie Roll may have started us on our way toward addictions to high fructose corn syrup and partially hydrogenated vegetable oil, but we don't want to think about that right now.  Nor how it gets stuck in our teeth, or to our braces or dental work.In fact, I gave 4 little Tootsie Rolls away the other day, to a friend with two young children, as I know they will handle Tootsie Rolls much better than I do now.But let me turn my mind to Tootsie Pops. Fond memories of childhood, yes, all the flavors of hard candy wrapped around a Tootsie Roll center.  I don't eat those anymore, either.No, what I'm pondering is amaretto and orange juice, a holiday beverage mixed by my brother-in-law that, to me, tastes exactly like an orange Tootsie Pop.  A semi-healthy (Vitamin C) drink to get you through the hump of the week."},

As this article in the New York Times points out, some of that went by the wayside when teachers told us not to write in our books (raises fees on book rental at school, etc.), and writing in the margins might be a habit lost forever with the new surge of e-readers.  On the other hand, college writing programs have been using electronic notation systems for a several years, so I’m sure, as they say now, there will be “an app” for e-book notation soon enough. But, yes, it’s great to find that wonderful note in the margin by a famous writer! Or that sweet anonymous note by a previous reader! Or that mass of underlining, circling, stars and symbols, and words-followed-by-definitions…all evidence of the close reader, the engaged reader!Yes, that will be harder to do and harder to find with the new e-reading trends.But, in Fat Tuesday fullness of life mode, I confess that a bunch of my books are full of marginalia.I re-learned messy marginalia when I started discussing books with the “shared inquiry” method at a Great Books home salon and the public event called Great Books Chicago some years ago.  It is so much easier to find the page with the quotation you need if you have highlighted or underlined it, written a star in the margin next to it, and dog-eared that dogarned page. (Good to do this with Dover Thrift or Penguin paperback editions.  Not so good to do with first edition, first printings!)I often fill the margins with questions, too. And then ask them of my fellow readers!Yes, you might call me an engaged reader. Some people are reading not to engage but to escape. They might not want to take notes, make stars, or write questions.  E-reading & the lack of marginalia won’t be a problem at all for them!And that’s a circling around to the what-are-you-reading-and-why project I began a little over a year ago.

Finding nuts in the general area of the kitchen is OK.I won't be drinking any of this--Wild Turkey--and I notice you have to enter your birth date even to enter the official Wild Turkey website.Speaking of birth dates, mine is circling around again tomorrow, making me finally old enough to enter the Wild Turkey website.Heh heh.No, really, this is the year in which I will be reading The Elegance of the Hedgehog, by Muriel Barbery, because I will be the same age as the French concierge philosopher woman.No particular birthday plans with family wamily, but a poet friend is coming over in the afternoon tomorrow, and that will be a treat.  I will offer her leftover turkey chili (leftover is the best! spices steep, etc.) but no Wild Turkey, unless I can get hold of this beautiful bottle. And then we might just want to run our fingers over the glass ridges. Because we are poets."},
{"title": "A Common Liberation", "date": "Friday, February 18, 2011", "text": "I have been reading The Common Review, current issue, Fall/Winter 2010 and first issue under the new editor, Danny Postel.  You can see table of contents and samples here, and read Postel’s generous editorial praising the previous editor, Dan Born. Postel also praises the recently departed historian/writer/political philosopher Tony Judt, who sounds fascinating for the complexity and nuance of his thought. I always appreciate reading about people who can balance apparent contradictions and who don’t have to take one simplistic, trendy, or extreme stance on a topic.  But what I’ll report on today is a book review in this issue, by John Clark, of the book Why I Am a Buddhist, by Stephen T. Asma. And I’ll start right off with a digression by saying I love this title because it reminds me of a poem I like, by Molly Peacock, called “Why I Am Not a Buddhist.”  (And that’s just one of the ways I myself balance apparent contradictions and dancing angels on the pointy tip of my origami brain.)The Asma book’s subtitle is even more fun: No-Nonsense Buddhism with Red Meat and Whiskey, and hints at both the “blue-collar Buddhism” the book’s author celebrates and the problems addressed by Clark in his critique. While there might indeed be ethical ways to eat meat for some contemporary and historical Buddhists, Clark brings up today’s “ethical vegetarian” Buddhists (including traditional herder Tibetans) and the “factory farming” that compromises meat-eating in today’s economy and in a philosophy of compassion.I pause to recommend My Year of Meats, a novel by Ruth L. Ozeki. (And to mention the contradiction that last night I ate a hamburger.)Back to John Clark’s review in The Common Review…But first, I have been pondering my own Emily Dickinsonish retreat-from-society tendencies and how, oddly, they do not at all conflict with my yearning for social justice, nor with Dr. Zhivago’s insistence that caring for individuals is the way to make a truly livable society. I pause to note that I connect strongly to a dead reclusive poet and a fictional character poet.  How shall I live in this world?!  Anyhoo….Clark: “It is said that the final message of the Buddha was that we should work out our own salvation with diligence.  We do, indeed, need to travel that lonesome highway.  However, the Buddha also taught the doctrine of no separate selfhood.  The suffering that is so central to the human predicament is not ultimately an individualistic thing.”  We all suffer.  So we can all have compassion for one another. And both of these things bring us together.If you live in a state where the needs of the society are elevated above the needs (and rights) of the individual OR if you live in a mental state where one individual (the self or the totalitarian dictator) is elevated above the community, no one is going to be happy.  Or not for long.  Push will eventually come to shove.  The people will gently or violently push out the reigning government, or the individual living in a shack in the mountains will email his buddies and create a flash mob with AK-47s in a mall, right?  There’s got to be a better way.“Perhaps the best reason to be a Buddhist,” says Clark, going on to clarify that not every “awakened person” need actually be a Buddhist, “is to have the opportunity to be part of a compassionate community in which we ourselves, those we love, our coworkers, and our fellow citizens can all be part of, as Asma says, a ‘collective flourishing’or, as the Buddha put it, a common liberation.”I think this “common liberation” can start as a state of mind, one that would lead to an exemplary human community, and generally is a state free from all kinds of fear. Blessed indeed are the meek, who keep saying no, standing up to oppressors, asking them to reconsider, and courageously shrugging off their fears and burdens.“And I’ll gladly pay you Tuesday for a hamburger today.”"},
{"title": "Mousetrap", "date": "Thursday, February 17, 2011", "text": "Maybe once I had a mind like a steel trap. But now? Well, you've heard about the muffin. You've heard about the origami. Now it might be more like holey cheese. Holy Cheese! That fits perfectly.Some things stay. Some things get away. Like mice. I love sweet cute little mice. In children's books. And mice are fine, close up, in real life. But I don't like them in houses I live in. They poop a lot in kitchen drawers. I grew up in a farmhouse, where my parents still live, every winter catching a lot of mice that run in from the fields. They keep a running tally. Last year they caught 99 mice, as I recall.But I might not be recalling the actual total from 2010, just from a particular conversation on a certain day in 2010. I am fascinated by what happens in the nips & tucks of our whole and demented brains. And that brings me to Agatha Christie, dementia, the fugue state, and NPR. I'm sure I heard a reference to Agatha Christie's failing memory in her later writings, and her possible defense of that in a later book, on an NPR story this past Sunday morning, probably on Radiolab. But I can't quite track it down. Paul Auster was mentioned, too. I can search these terms, but everything folds together into the other stories offered there.So I leave you to listen to Vanishing Words and to read about the Nun Study, which have folded into my blog before. Agatha Christie really did run away from home one day in 1926, possibly in a fugue state of near amnesia, stressed out and depressed by her philandering husband. And she really did write a mystery play called The Mousetrap, still running in London, that started out as a radio play called Three Blind Mice!And we really did experience another mystery in our household, this one The Mystery of the Mousetrap. It's this kind of a mousetrap, the plastic recyclable kind that you can get here, at Trendy Gadget, but which we got at a local hardware store. We caught a mouse in it (sigh...moment of silence/sadness) and put it outside in the snow, where the actual dead mouse was quickly extricated and devoured in the circle of life. (This comforted my husband, whose father did keep, feed, and live with mice in the house.) The trap was left there on the ground to be cleaned later and then, yesterday, appeared on the corner of the picnic table, not placed there by a human who lives in this house, not by a Dog Named Wolf, and not by a passing garage door repairman.Who put the mousetrap on the picnic table?  Was it a) a crow b) an owl c) a squirrel or d) Agatha Christie?"},

Ouch, ouch, ouch.  People keep losing their jobs! But it's also very funny.See, I will keep telling you what people are reading, but I am not going to keep track of days.  Still planning to introduce some categories of existence in future blogging, but today is a busy day of new starts, errands, and appointments, so I am just going to fill you in on the true \"facts\" of the memetastic award entry, and be random.OK, to set your mind at rest (as I already set my mother's mind at rest), no pipe has burst in our house!  No, we will not paint the house lavender.  And, while people do come to the door offering to paint our house, trim our trees, and replace our windows, no one has yet arrived on a Saturday night, drunk, to offer these services. A friend and neighbor assures me that the finger gluing is impossible, as she repeatedly tried to glue her fingers together as a child, and failed, so that leaves....The Mystery of the Muffin.We still do not know why a flattened muffin wrapper and many chocolate muffin crumbs appeared in the middle of the kitchen floor the other day...but a Dog Named Wolf was visiting, and we feared the worst. Diarrhea, followed by death.  But the Dog Named Wolf is fine and evidently did not eat the chocolate muffin.Who did?  Every human who lives in the house has been questioned and denies the recent acquisition and ingestion of a muffin.  (I know from the weird news that sometimes people live in attics and come down to eat and steal things while the homeowners are away, but I don't think that applies in this case.) That leaves...The Garage Door Repairman.Did he, in fact, have a crumb-covered muffin wrapper in his coat pocket after a hasty breakfast and early morning garage door repair job?!  Did said muffin wrapper fall from repairman's pocket to our kitchen floor to be nosed to the center of the room by a Dog Named Wolf?These and other true \"facts\" may never be known.But it's \"true\" that I have compared my brain to 1) origami 2) gray batter and 3) a blueberry muffin."},

Here's a big heavy heart.A couple of things to share with you today:1) A Visit from St. Valentine for those who resist all pink & red sentimentality2) The lovely blog of Susan Rich, who always shares the love.She's the author of The Alchemist's Kitchen, a book of poems with this green and lavender glow (though the cover has more of a matte sheen than a glossy glow in real life).And I've been waiting to feature this book today because of this poem, \"At Middle-Life: A Romance,\" for any of you who might be waiting for or right now experiencing a romance at middle life. It's like a train!So here are her couplets, in italics, followed my responses, in regular font.  I do love couplets in a love poem.Let love be imminent and let it be a train;let it arrive at dawn, its whistle whiskering the air--all brightness and verb.  Let it nearly race bybut not quite--this could be the story of your life.You can hear and see the speed of this train, partly thanks to those dashes.  And the \"whistle whiskering\" sound is something to say out loud.  Try it!  It also creates the hiss of wheels, the train pausing for us.  The urgency here is powerful, life-changing, and the poet has rapidly put us on the train and created suspense.Don't hesitate outside the dining car of eccentricand dark-eyed strangers, contemplating their espresso--ordering half the nerve. Let love be a breakfastof creme cakes, pomegranate juice, a lively Spanish torte.We do get to hesitate outside the dining car on this rumbling train, peering in at the exotic possibilities, maybe at tables with white tablecloths, as on older luxury trains, or in movies.  We don't want to be \"ordering half the nerve,\" do we?  We want the full, lush breakfast!Love ambles its way through post-industrial towns,past fields of alfalfa blooms, past poplarsthat have always been there, though you've neversensed their sacredness before. Let love be amazing.Now that we're aboard the love train, love can take its own sweet time.  We can be happy with the scenery.  And look at how we get to see the poplars, suspended at the end of a line, the ones \"that have always been there,\" but that we've never really noticed, for themselves or for their sacredness, a surprise that love can bring, and that makes the poem's claim different from \"a silly love song\" on the radio.  (Though John Lennon and Paul McCartney also worked that out.)  Love is amazing.And when the next station appears in full view--all green tones and jazz tunes;let two of these travelers disembark--primed to begin their nights in pursuit.Well, that's a happy ending!  But we do have to remember that it has all been imagined, and hoped for, and brought on with the word \"Let,\" which is both plea, as in, \"Let it be me,\" and command, as in, \"Let there be light.\"  What an amazing balance and suspension.There are many other amazements in The Alchemists's Kitchen that I'll let you discover on your own!"},

Pierpont, the get-ahead-fast window washer, has real gumption and will be headed for politics soon.  American politics, in a capitalist society.And that brings me to a comment I got recently on my quitting-my-job blog entry, that I chose not to publish.  My first impulse was to publish it--why not?!--it was cleverly written and made its points well about bosses being kings and employees being peons, but it ended with an insult and was signed with a humorous but fake name.  That is, the commenter claims to have met me, but doesn't own up to a real identity. I guess in my blog you can't get personal if you won't be a real person, or acknowledge common humanity.And I guess that means I'm still queen here.Ever since I read Shakespeare and Company, by bookstore proprietor Sylvia Beach, after reading two books about literary feuds, I've been wanting to quote this generous and tolerant comment: \"Wars between writers blaze up frequently, but I have observed that they settle down eventually into smudges.\"I'm sure this feud, too, will settle down into a smudge soon enough."},
{"title": "Egypt & Dr. Zhivago", "date": "Friday, February 11, 2011", "text": "In my ongoing are-these-DVDs-damaged? project (some DVDs we inherited were subjected to rain), I watched Dr. Zhivago in two parts over the past two days.  I remembered it would be a very long movie, and I kept waiting for the scene where the writing room is covered in snow and the appearance of Julie Christie and Omar Sharif.  The actors playing young Zhivago and young Lara were doing a wonderful job, and the one playing young Lara looked amazingly like Keira Knightley.Because, of course, she was.  I finally realized I was watching the 2002 British television version, not the film I remembered from childhood.  (Must have still been a little discombobulated from quitting my job.  I also forgot to go to my exercise class, but I blame that on the broken garage door.  Intense cold, broken coil spring, etc.)  It also explained why the destroyer of Zhivago's father and seducer of young Lara looked so much like Sam Neill.But watching Zhivago coincided with following the news on the people's revolution in Egypt, where things continue in turmoil and where I have a college friend covering the events for the news and also posting notes at Facebook.  I worry about her safety and her spirits.  And caring about her is key to the difference between one way of looking at the world and another.In Dr. Zhivago, the doctor cares about the individuals more than the society, knowing that this care and love is what makes life worth living and would lead, anyway, to the best kind of society.  Boris Pasternak, who wrote the book (which I read in youth after seeing the film), was criticized by his own society, for just this kind of love and way of looking at things. He was forced by the USSR to reject the Nobel Prize he was awarded after first accepting it with gratitude and awe.  Pasternak tried to figure out how to live in his world, a repressive one, and met criticism from within his country and without, because it was a hard figure.Whether the Russian revolution, the French one, the one in Egypt, it's clear to see that those in power will never willingly give it up, and those who take power run the risk of becoming the new oppressors or the new dealers in violence.  I hope for the safety of my reporter friend, and for the safety of those attempting peaceful protests and working hard to change their country.  I hope for a transition that values life.And Dr. Zhivago is a poet. Pasternak, too, was a poet.  The book and film show how poetry is easily, and sometimes not so easily, dismissed by the powerful and beloved by the people.  In story and in life, Zhivago and Pasternak were spared arrest or execution because of their genius and integrity.  I find that inspiring, and see how it leads to a great responsibility.***Update:  Holy Moly, Mubarek stepped down!  Yay for the persistence and patience of the people, and for their conviction, and ability to stand up for one another.  Let there be peaceful transition now.CBS radio roundup: \"Revolution in Egypt\""},
{"title": "Among Women", "date": "Thursday, February 10, 2011", "text": "Thank you all for the outpouring of love and support in response to my blog post yesterday, Wait! I Quit My Job?!, in which I accidentally but for real quit my job. I cannot express how touched and amazed I was by your generous and feeling responses. So, thank you, thank you, thank you.I did not sleep that night, and mostly forgot to eat the next day, but your support, and a similar showering of hugs at Facebook and in real life, plus naked cuddling with my husband, has done wonders!  I woke up smiling!Hey, I don't have to go to work today!Before that unexpected blog post sprang up in my life, I had planned to tell you some things I learned from 365 days of blogging about what people read, both about reading trends and blogging stuff, including what seems to inspire blogger comments.I learned on Day 366 that revealing one's vulnerability and raw need, risky as that is, inspires the most comments. Again, thank you.And that brings me to Among Women, a book of poems by Jason Shinder, an astonishing and beautiful book of vulnerability and raw need.  It begins with revelations in the first poem, \"The One Secret That Has Carried,\" and never lets up.  Here are the first few lines:  \"Irene loves a man / who is afraid of sex--/ she's attended // to everything, / said it was okay, / held me until I slept.  (Those slash marks are line breaks and stanza breaks, for you non-poets.)  At the end of this poem is the revelation that some things must be denied: \"I've never told this story. / Even at the moment / of dying, / I would say / it was someone else's.\"This is especially poignant because Jason Shinder did die, young, recently (2008), and his last book, Stupid Hope, was released posthumously.  Here is his New York Times obituary, and here is an article by a woman he once dated, discussing his dance with death.  I was astonished at how much I connect with him in what I learned from Melanie Thernstrom in that article--he was \"a cheerleader for poetry\" and he avoided chemotherapy.  (Which I would probably also avoid.  Having some similar throat symptoms, by the way; yes, that kind of over-identification sometimes occurs when I read, but I'm pretty sure it's from thyroid issues that run in the family wamily, so don't worry.)While some thought Shinder was in denial of death--and denial is a complicated and risky business--he was evidently confronting and accepting, while also fearing, death in these last poems. You can bet Stupid Hope is on my wishlist!And the experience of not being able to stop reading a book of poems is the one I want to share with you.  Among Women was a non-stop read for me a couple nights ago.  As people say of thrillers and \"page-turners\" of all sorts, I could not put it down.  I tend to read books of poems more slowly, as I've mentioned before, sometimes poem-by-poem, sometimes section-by-section, mostly straight through in order after perhaps sampling a bit, but not always without interruption by other kinds of reading.  This one grabbed me and wouldn't let me go.It challenged and inspired me.  I want to write a book like that, that someone won't be able to put down.  I will have to look at the poetry-manuscripts-in-progress with that in mind.Thanks to poet Sarah J. Sloat for recommending Shinder to me over at Goodreads!  And thanks again to Pamela Callahan for yesterday's bird paintings.The pertinent random coincidii:--the cover is a painting by Edward Hopper called Excursion into Philosophy--naked husband and I both love Edward Hopper--I've written a poem called \"Excursion into Poetry\" that responds to this same painting, published in Poems & Plays--Jason Shinder started out as Allen Ginsberg's assistant (HOWL!)--last night I was \"among women\" beginning to plan a women's retreat about nurturing our...selves.--the whole \"cheerleader for poetry\" business mentioned above--raw vulnerability (Will it Blend?)"},
{"title": "Wait! I Quit My Job?!", "date": "Wednesday, February 9, 2011", "text": "Good thing I finished the 365 Days of Reading blog project yesterday.  Yes, in the same way I started my blog--accidentally--I quit my job. Now I knew something was building to a head because I found myself requesting a conversation at work, as I felt we needed to clear the air about a few things.  During the conversation, a few things did become excruciatingly clear.In short, that I was disposable and easily replaceable.So I left.No job is perfect.  I can put up with a lot—the chaos of the back room, shoveling myself out of the back lot, you know, the annoying crap we often find ourselves stumbling around in, sometimes literally, if the cat box gets too full, low pay, etc.—but I’ve never been able to stay in a situation where I’m just plain not valued.And it always takes me just a little too long to realize that.Call me human.  Call me equally human.I loved my job.  Goodbye, charmed life with books.  Goodbye, random shop talk.  Goodbye, hourly wage.And I felt icky leaving.  But, as often happens, reading came to my rescue.  Not only that, but Marilynne Robinson, one of my favorites. She’s the author of Housekeeping, Gilead, Home (three novels) and The Death of Adam, a book of essays so intense it took me about a year to read. (Plus, Mother Country, which I yearn for.) So I was reading another of her intense, dense essays, the one that saved me, before a junior high volleyball game (at Epiphany!!!!), and I had to read the same three paragraphs three times over during the loud warm-up music to actually retain the words and their meaning.  OK, and I also might have been a bit preoccupied by accidentally quitting my job.I might have been replaying in my head a moment late in the day, one I can already laugh at for its perfection, but which was pretty icky at the time.  It needs a little set up.  Trying to explain to my boss about ways he might value his employees intangibly, as that can go a long way toward employee satisfaction, I’d told him that I wished he wouldn’t keep saying, when people came in looking for work, “All my current employees are tenaciously holding onto their jobs.”  I knew he meant it as humorous, but it was getting tedious to hear.“It’s not funny anymore,” I said, “and it makes it sound like if I’d just get out of the way you could hire that person.  But we do need more staff.  And you’re not hiring for other reasons.”This open and honest communication, something I was asking for more of in the workplace, did not go over well.  So, having mulled it over in a somewhat fragile state for a few hours, alone in the store, tending to a string of customers and people bringing in books, and handling a series of phone calls, while also trying to attend to my real job, of data entry….as I said, later, when the boss returned, now almost unable to look me in the eye, but I have a gentle manner, so, eventually, he did, I said to the boss, referring to how he’d spoken to me earlier, “I don’t ever want to feel like that in my workplace again,” and offered him this option: “Should I just leave now, or should I give two weeks notice, so you have time to look for sometime else.”“I’m not firing you,” he said.  Yes, now he was looking me in the eyes.And then, as in a movie, a tall, skinny college kid walked in and said, not knowing which one of us to address, “Are you hiring?“Yes, as a matter of fact we are,” said my boss.There was a flurry of small cruelty, on his part, and math challenge, on mine, as I totaled the hours on my last pay card, and off I headed to the volleyball game.  Easy come, easy go.What I read three times over during the volleyball warm-ups was this, a summary of the contemporary myth, in America, that has replaced other origin myths:  A central myth of ours, if it were rendered as narrative, would sound like this: One is born and in passage through childhood suffers some grave harm.  Subsequent good fortune is meaningless because of this injury, while subsequent misfortune is highly significant as the consequence of this injury.  The work of one’s life is to discover and name the harm one has suffered. This is not a myth I live by, but I realized yesterday, at Epiphany school, it is a myth lived by many people whose lives I have passed through.And, believe me, I respect myths.  In fact, Myths to Live By, by Joseph Campbell, is on my bookshelf, held together by a rubber band.  So, yes, I confess that the myths I live by are probably all ancient.  And that I recognize them as myths.  Stories that tell deep, abiding truths.But Marilynne Robinson has a bit of a problem with the current abiding myth: “It is a myth that allows us to keep ourselves [my italics] before our eyes as the first claimant, in extreme cases the only claimant, upon our pity and indulgence.”Ourselves the only claimant.  Doesn’t sit right with me.Marilynne Robinson continues, “This entails indifference to certain values celebrated in older myth, for example, dignity, self-possession, magnanimity, loyalty, humor, courage, selflessness, reverence expressed as gratitude for one’s experience of the goodness of life, reverence expressed as awe in face of the pain and mystery of life.”I cannot tell you how awed and glad I am that the last words I said to my boss were, “Thank you, Brian. I’ve loved it here.”"},
{"title": "365 Days of Reading", "date": "Tuesday, February 8, 2011", "text": "It's Day 365 of the \"What are you reading, and why?\" project!! For 365 days, a full year, I posted about what someone was reading (including self, family, friends, and strangers). I discovered this by asking or observing, in a variety of places, including the bookshop, of course, but also the beach, church, homes, and volleyball tournaments.  I focused on print matter--mostly books, but sometimes periodicals, including magazines and literary journals. And, even with all the electronic ways to read, people are still reading books, and, whatever way we read, people are definitely reading and loving it.  What a joy it has been to chat with you all.  And thanks so much to those who commented here, furthering the discussions and sharing recommendations.Yesterday, I looked back at some of the blog entries at the beginning of the project, to remind myself of its impetus and to make sure I hadn't lost track.  I am math challenged, you know.I was reminded of the whole chick lit/dick lit thing--equal time for annoying sexist labels--and Julie's suggestion of the more Internet-search friendly term \"lad lit,\" so I will tell you that a man looking for vacation reading walked out of the bookstore yesterday with what we might call lad lit:  Catcher in the Rye, by J. D. Salinger (time for a re-read); Songbook, essays on music by Nick Hornby (he would have taken The Wishbones, if we'd had it); and Stranger Than Fiction, a book of short stories by Chuck Palahniuk.  I almost bought the latter myself, as soon as I saw it, riffling through to see if there was a story in it that was the basis of the film Stranger Than Fiction, which I love, but it isn't. No, now that I realize Palahniuk has an official site called The Cult, I may stay away.  But you can let me know otherwise.  This is the lad who wrote Fight Club.I may have realized that before, even here in this blog, as info seems to fold like blueberries into the gray batter of my brain when I am writing an entry a day on what people are reading!And, as far as math challenge goes...I started this project on February 10th, but, here it is, Day 365, on February 8th.  I know there's a reasonable explanation for this...but I already put those muffins in the oven.Kathleen's brain.Blueberry muffin.Blueberry muffin is clearly larger.Anyhoo, I began the project after watching the film Julie and Julia, and musing on Julie's blog project of cooking Julia Child recipes and blogging about it.  Like random clockwork, the book Julie and Julia turned up in the shop the other day, but I resisted it, leaving it to some other happy customer, as I would also have to resist Mastering the Art of French Cooking, by Julia Child, if it turned up.  One, because I am a lousy cook, and, two, because it would be very, very expensive.Again, anyhoo, wait...what was the anyhoo?!  Find out tomorrow...!  How's that for a page turner?"},
{"title": "Post Howlism", "date": "Monday, February 7, 2011", "text": "Day 364 of the \"What are you reading, and why?\" project, and yesterday all the streets were closed off in front of and surrounding my workplace, the bookstore, when I headed there after church.  It promised to be an annoying afternoon.  When the orange-cone situation turned out not to be 1) a murder 2) a pending explosion 3) a major ongoing leak, but, instead, 4) temporary-but-ongoing utility work, I got to work and promptly got stuck in the unshoveled back lot.I will pause to mention that the boss bought a $100 electric shovel on a whim during the snowstorm...and then did not use it on the employee parking spaces in back.  Yes, yes, I was pissy and annoyed, but I got over it. I had to vent a little, to everyone around me, but I got over it.  Oh, wait, I am venting now!!With a regular hand shovel, I shoveled myself out, and shoveled a space for myself  behind my fellow employee who had, originally, driven briefly and \"illegally\" (I quote her) down the other side of the street to get to work. Later, she shoveled under her car, which was able to get in but unlikely to get out, we did the move-the-cars shuffle, and she went home, while I kept working...till it was time to find something to eat and see Howl, the movie about Allen Ginsberg.I was in two nearly deserted public establishments during the Super Bowl--one, a restaurant with a bar, where, indeed, the Super Bowl was on above the bar, so I saw glimpses, and the second, the theatre itself, which had maybe 7 moviegoers + 6 staff.  Many locals had seen the film when it was shown Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, and more when it was shown last year during the LGBT Film Festival, when I got to see Leading Ladies, a sweet, funny, dance film that we hope Ellen Degeneres is watching right now!Anyhoo, I can report that a woman is soon to be reading a stack of local history books, searching for the \"food ways\" of local college students, faculty, and staff during the early days of Illinois State Normal College.  What did they eat, where did they eat? What restaurants were available? What local foods? What campus meals, and when were they available? Who cooked it? I remember my dad talking about the wonderful home-cooked foods at Wooster College in Ohio, the townswomen who baked cakes* and pies for dessert.  I hope our current reader discovers similarly delectable facts about this area.*This is actually a home made Smith Island cake, the state dessert of Maryland, photographed by Paul Johnson, on Flickr, who allows this use with attribution!! (\"Howooo!\" Woman [this blogger] howling for cake under moon.)And I can report that Howl is a real treat.  James Franco is up for an Oscar this year for 127 Hours, and he is surely a delight in Howl.  And I was so moved by the clip of Allen Ginsberg at the end.  I love the blend of black and white filming, color filming, and animation in this movie, and also the chance to hear sections of the poem more than once!  It really aids in understanding this long poem to hear it as voiceover behind animation and then again in the context of Ginsberg reading it to his friends in a smoky cafe setting, or vice versa. And the film has the excitement of a courtroom drama, since it is one, with poet/publisher Lawrence Ferlinghetti as the defendant in the obscenity trial for Howl and Other Poems, published by his City Lights Books.David Strathairn is marvelous, as always, as the prosecutor who does not understand and is troubled by the poem, and Mary Louise Parker and Jeff Daniels get to do cameos giving testimony you love to hate.  And Jon Hamm and Bob Balaban get to speak up for free speech.So, that's my short, late review of Howl.  You can read a better one here, in the New York Times.  That reviewer doesn't like the animation, but I thought it had the little-boy vigor and enthusiasm of these on-the-road little boys discovering themselves. It brings to mind Ginsberg's answer to the interviewer, asking, \"What was the Beat Generation?\"\"There was no Beat Generation,\" said Ginsberg.  \"It was just a bunch of guys trying to get published.\"So there you have it: my pissy rant, and a real howl about the loss of the best minds of a generation."},
{"title": "Super Howl Sunday", "date": "Sunday, February 6, 2011", "text": "Day 363 of the \"What are you reading, and why?\" project, and I finished Shakespeare and Company, by Sylvia Beach, in bed last night, not at the volleyball match, where I saw someone reading the new George Bush book and someone reading an old-fashioned print newspaper. And someone right beside me reading something very tiny on a hand-held device.I sat in a little river of libero parents.  Yes, by random coincidence, I sat next to the dad of the Blue team's libero, #41, the dad of the visiting club's libero, #10, and I am the mother of the Red team's libero, #30.  The libero is a defensive player in the back row who can come in for, not one, but two front row players, and freely (the libero part, I think), not having to be waved in by the ref.  In high-level school tournament play, there is a libero tracker to make sure all this is kosher. All three liberos were very good, and two had been coached by my husband, as that is his special duty this season of high school age club volleyball. Hubby joined the river and sat beside me after his team (from the morning matches) was done, having won all their games, and after driving all the way home to the fine stew I'd left him in the crockpot and then all the way back for our daughter's crowning match. Her team also won.How does this tie in with Sylvia Beach? Her last chapter is about the Liberation, after the German occupation of Paris. \"Hemingway Liberates the Rue de l'Odeon\" is the last titled vignette. I don't think that gives anything away. We know what happened at the end of World War II. (This is a picture of Hemingway in World War I.)The Rue de l'Odeon is the street Sylvia Beach was living/working/hiding on by the end of the book, and one day she and her friends carried all the books, furniture, and shelving up two flights of stairs to a hiding place to save it from the Germans. Ernest Hemingway, in full bloody, dirty war hero mode, came to make sure they were all right on the day the last of the German tanks were rolling out of the city.I learned lots about book biz & publishing biz in this little book, and more about James Joyce, who seems a charming, shy, lovable, quirky guy afraid of dogs and bad about keeping track of money but good about spending it. Yes, I will probably have to go ahead and read his book Ulysses, that no one would publish (except Sylvia) and that kept getting banned, confiscated, and pirated, so that neither she nor he could benefit from the demand for it. Or maybe I won't. I'm glad it's out there, and that I have the choice.I don't really know what everyone objected to.  Obscenity?  Bad words, people having sex?  It's all around us, all the time. We do it. Oh, and you might enjoy this blog entry by Carolee Sherwood, called penis paintings on friday, vagina monologues on saturday.At any rate, I feel free to go to the movie Howl tonight, about the poet Allen Ginsberg and his obscenity trial, instead of watching the Super Bowl."},
{"title": "On Beauty", "date": "Saturday, February 5, 2011", "text": "Day 362 of the \"What are you reading, and why?\" project, and my goofy sense of humor inspired 3 people to tell me what they are reading.  That is, over at Facebook, I posted a link to my previous blog entry, Random Shop Talk, with its image of Bond, James Bond, talking shop with his true love, along with the comment, \"Book.  Need book.\"Diane then brought up On Beauty, by Zadie Smith, which I love, and I told her about White Teeth, another Zadie Smith book, made into a mini-series, which the hubby and I just watched on Hulu.  Told Ben about this in the bookstore, too, as he had enjoyed White Teeth, which I recommended to him!Both of these novels weave history and cultural conflict into the main narrative beautifully, generally exposing the flaws in anyone's extreme adherence to one thing or one stance.  On Beauty looks at art and religion, and White Teeth looks at science and religion, but that is too much of a generalization and summary.  So much goes on in both novels.  So much is brilliant, so much is funny.  Both build to a big public event...and I like the tenderness at the end of On Beauty, and how Smith can be subtle even while laying it all out there.Wikipedia tells me On Beauty is an homage to Howard's End, by E. M. Forster, and I liked learning that she followed the structure of another novel in writing her own.  On Beauty was short-listed for the Man Booker Prize, and she later won the Orange Prize for Fiction, and I tend to like those British literary award winners.Phyllis is reading Brightsided by Barbara Ehrenreich, about Americans' constant need to be chipper and cheerful and look on the bright side, which can lead to being blindsided by reality, when it smacks you in the face.  Reading some Zadie Smith could help Americans look at reality.And Sheila read The Girl She Left Behind during the blizzard, snowed in with no electricity, by daylight, and then, quite reasonably, went to bed. By Karen Brichoux, this one is a novel about a girl who leaves Montana for life in the big city, and then comes home.  Sounds like it's quite a journey of self knowledge.And me, I like how the pinks work in these images.  And I am still reading Sylvia Beach, and will, once again, take it to a volleyball tournament, later today.  Meanwhile, the state cheerleading championship is also going on in our town."},

White faux fur, pink ears, a pink bow or rosette, long white furry dangling ties. I don't know what kind of animal it was. A fantasy animal, perhaps. (But they have something similar at Hot Topic, via Amazon, here, that purports to be a rabbit.)Back to the other young couple, and an inexplicable shift to present tense. The young man comes to the register with two books, one a contemporary paperback I've forgotten, and one a small, dark hardcover. Behind him is the young woman. Both are friendly.\"Ah,\" I say, opening the hardcover to find the price, and the little yellow post-it, showing it was shelved in our Etiquette section. \"What a Young Wife Ought to Know!\" I pull off the post-it, with our stock number on it, so we can mark it sold later in the database, and look up, a twinkle in my eye, first at the young man and next at the young woman, to say, \"We also have What a Young Husband Ought to Know!\"I know this because that's my job--I just described it in our online catalogue and carried it to what I like to call, sometimes fondly, and sometimes with a toe-stubbing lack of fondness, \"the chaos of the back room.\"In the split second it takes my eyes to twinkle at the young woman, I am also imagining a foray into the chaos of the back room--\"Danger!  Danger, Will Robinson!\"--and fearing my own and the young couple's possible disappointment if I never returned....Not to fear! And a twinkle in the eye is often contagious. \"We also found,\" says the young woman, \"What a Middle-Aged Woman Ought to Know.\" And, speaking of danger, a former co-worker came into the store yesterday, too, to give us a jazz book and look around a bit, while illegally parked on the snow-heaped street, and I learned that his middle name, a family name, is Danger.  Oh, my!  He is a man who can actually say, \"Danger is my middle name.\""},

Sigh...  I get various brochures about writing conferences in exotic places, some warm, this one perched above a beach....  Well, we'll see. Back to the present.  (And the other customer bought a $3 ex-library anthology of science fiction stories, muttering to himself, and sometimes to me, but he was charming, if a little off-putting also, and clearly a science fiction aficionado and collector.)Back to the past.  I had forgotten that Thornton Wilder was also an actor.  How can I forget these things?!  Here he is as Mr. Antrobus in The Skin of Our Teeth.  (As I recall, the world gets covered in ice in that play.) And he played the Stage Manager in Our Town.  And here's another thing I forgot, or never knew.  Our Town was inspired by Gertrude Stein's novel, The Making of Americans.  I wonder when/if that will come up in the book I am reading, as Beach does talk about Stein and other intersections and influences.  However, on page 111, she has just let Thornton Wilder walk off to the rue Christine, \"that is, Steinwards.\"Soon, I must go upstairs, that is, breakfastwards. So I leave you with Michael J. Fox, playing the guitar, and one of my other favorite lines from Back to the Future, uttered by Huey Lewis, of Huey Lewis and the News, a rock and roll band: \"It's just too loud.\""},

She writes of him so feelingly, and tells in such detail the difficulty of publishing his book Ulysses, that now I might just have to read it! I love the short stories in Dubliners but had never attempted Ulysses beyond the odd excerpts provided in odd literature anthologies. It's so long! Or, as concerns booksellers who must carry, stock, and ship it, so heavy!Another coincidence is that Joyce had eye surgery, and I have been reading the account of poet Mark Doty's eye surgeries in his blog. Excruciating, but the good news is he can read again!If you did not get out to the bookstore yesterday, here are some things you can read online:--new Paul Hostovsky poetry feature at Escape Into Life--new issue of Soundzine (click the beautiful blue image to enter), which you can also listen to!I have a poem, \"White Morning Glory,\" in the new Soundzine, which I was able to record with the help of my son and Audacity (a sound program you can download) (on his laptap with a good microphone) on the day the city came to trim the trees.  Somehow we got the poem recorded between power saw noises. They trimmed the very branch these Pearly Gates had entwined on their climb!Also announcing the release of Brute Neighbors, an anthology of poetry and photographs that explore how nature and culture live side by side in the city (sometimes tree trimming). You can click around at that website to hear/see a couple of the poets in videos, and a reading is coming up in Chicago on March 7, and maybe later in April. (I have a poem in that, too.)OK, hunker down, dearies.  And I am going to imagine the groundhog curled up with a book today, so he doesn't come out at all, and there's no risk of seeing his shadow, although, it's true, it might still take him six weeks to come out if he's reading Ulysses."},

Since then, my neighbor has posted photos of empty grocery store shelves on her Facebook page, so I'm glad he thought of it, and I checked on my folks yesterday, who are well-stocked and have drawn some water in case the electricity goes off and the pump stops...or freezes.  They have lots of blankets in case of the power loss, too.  But once the snow comes, they'll be stuck up that long driveway until the neighboring farmer plows them out.  And he will.The snow hasn't come yet, not much anyway.  Some ice balls came, so I don't look forward to driving out there, but I do plan to go to work, as the boss and the manager are headed out to a big book buy at 11, so I'm it.  For all the people coming in to stock up on books for the blizzard!Since I left, I can't tell you what the woman stocked up on, but, once I got back, a man came in looking for Jeff Shaara, The Last Full Measure.  \"What kind of book is it?\" I asked.\"A paperback.\"\"Fiction, mystery?\" I said, nodding toward the mass market paperbacks and beyond, to the general fiction aisle.\"Civil War,\" he said.\"Oh, history?  Not fiction?\"Then there was a little more conversational stumbling, in which he used the words \"might not be true,\" but he insisted on being taken to the Civil War section, which was fine by me, while I was assuring him this was the history aisle, about actual history.  And I headed off to look up the book on Amazon.Fiction.  Part of a trilogy of books set in the Civil War.  Meanwhile, a regular customer came in, looking as usual for any new arrivals in the African American section.  \"We have some!\" I said, delighted, having just handled some.  \"But they might not be on the shelves yet.\"Meanwhile, my other customer was coming down the general fiction aisle, where I'd located Gods and Generals, the first book in the Civil War trilogy of novels. \"I've already read that,\" he said. \"Sorry,\" I said, \"but at least we know we're in the right place.\"Then he stood around disappointed for a while, and I went off to try to find the unshelved new-to-us books I'd handled at the end of last week which 1) were lost in the chaos of the back room or 2) sold online already and were found in the chaos of the back room by someone else.  Sigh...before our regular customer got a chance to find them on the shelf.  Happy Black History Month.So, it might be one of those kinds of days again.  If anyone comes it at all.Bundle up.  Safe travels.  Read."},

And here is a link to the Schaller book at University of California Press, and to Dr. Jill's website, where you can click all over the place, including Oprah.  I had just attended a little farewell gathering for a friend, where people were talking about Dr. Jill's book, so encountering both books made it seem like the universe was calling my name.But Radiolab has dealt with that, too, talking earlier this month to writer Paul Auster and animation expert Michael Barrier, in The Universe Knows My Name.  But, as some of the comments show, some of their listeners did not appreciate either the whimsy or implied mysticism of that particular program.Which brings me to my question:When my current \"What are you reading, and why?\" project ends, what would you like me to do next?  That is, can you tolerate my whimsy and random coincidii?  Do you want more of the same, but with variations or a particular focus? More of what other people are reading, or more of what I'm reading? Random bookshop conversations? More poetry reviews, more poetry interviews, more poem explications? More musical comedy? More of my own personal comedy? (It might make you roll your eyes.)During the next week or so, please comment and say what you've enjoyed here and what you'd like to see more of.  Or suggest a new topic or focus you'd like to see me handle.

I am not the only one trying to fit in a few pages between matches, between games, or even during a time out. Most people reading at volleyball tournaments are engrossed in 1) print newspapers or 2) thick mass market paperback mysteries or romances. And of course there are a lot of hand-held devices, but I don't know what people are doing with those...At the volleyball tourney yesterday, which continues today, I was reading Shakespeare and Company, by Sylvia Beach, about the famous bookshop and lending library in Paris, because my co-worker Sarah snagged me an ex-library copy in a recent book buy. Thank you, Sarah!This is a charming book, with photos of Sylvia's famous writer and composer and theatre friends in the middle. I love seeing Gertrude Stein and Alice B. Toklas in their everyday lives, and Sherwood Anderson has already walked into the store, drawn by the book in the window, his. Which is basically the way writers are...So, off I go to read a few pages in between my husband's match at 9:00 a.m. (he's the coach of the Blue team) and my daughter's match at 10:00 a.m. (she's on the Red team), before work at noon in the used bookshop.

She called the book a \"self parody,\" had a sense of humor, and also said she was \"humbled\" by her experience as a mom, especially when her second daughter didn't take so well to the strict Chinese parenting style she was using and basically rebelled.  Both daughters were in the audience, and Colbert asked, \"Are you OK?\"  He is so funny.  (You can see more about Time's coverage and the Colbert episode here, and the whole show at Comedy Central.)Of course, all this somehow connects to Seven Brides for Seven Brothers, the musical comedy I saw half of last night.  Howard Keel, as Adam, is a redheaded, red-bearded man, with six brothers of similar hairage, until Jane Powell, as Milly, Adam's new bride, makes them all shave.  Yes, she's sort of a tiger mom.I don't think I ever saw this movie before (it was definitely made before I was born), but I had seen clips of some of the famous dancing. And I used to watch Here Come the Brides on tv, which seems clearly based on this movie as well as its civilization-of-Seattle-after-the-Civil-War historical components.  Bobby Sherman was in Here Come the Brides!  As Jeremy, a character with a charming stammer!  Briefly cured by a traveling con artist! (Suddenly both The King's Speech and The Music Man come to mind!)And here's another interesting connection. Seven Brides was based on a short story by Stephen Vincent Benet, called \"The Sobbin' Women,\" itself based on The Rape of the Sabine Women of Roman legend.  Wikipedia assures us that \"rape\" here means \"abduction,\" as it does in the musical comedy The Fantasticks, but 1) they changed the song called \"Rape\" when they made the film version of The Fantasticks and 2) whether in Seattle, the generalized American frontier, or ancient Rome, it appears that men feel fine about taking women by force. At least here, as in Paint Your Wagon, there is 1) singing and dancing involved and 2) amazing respect for the woman's wishes after the fact.But there are also some wonderful accounts in writing and film of women who went west to homestead, answering men's advertisements in search of wives, getting to know each other a bit in letters first, or just taking the big risk. I like the sound of an adventure involving more choice than force, though circumstances can indeed \"force\" certain choices. Then, of course, there is the \"tiger mom\" aspect of the Sabine women themselves, who are depicted in this painting by Jacques-Louis David, sometimes called The Intervention of the Sabine Women, as running between the fighting men and making peace."},
{"title": "Wand'rin' Star", "date": "Thursday, January 27, 2011", "text": "Day 353 of the \"What are you reading, and why?\" project, and a sweet, earnest man came in to the bookstore yesterday looking for books by Karen Armstrong because he had seen her on Charlie Rose. (Here's her TED bio.)He particularly wanted her book on Islam, but we didn't have that, and other of her books had gone out recently, but I found for him The Case for God and The Spiral Staircase, an account of her life in the convent and why she left. We stood at the register for a while, waiting for Sarah to get off the phone so we could run his credit card (small business quirk) and talking about compassion in the world in times like these, or in any times.  What we have in common.  It was a small, sweet moment of connection with a stranger.  Now we are less strangers.And what could be stranger, you might ask, than the American theatre convention of musical comedy?  And, I might answer, a musical comedy western! I refer, of course, to Paint Your Wagon, starring Clint Eastwood as a singing Gold Rush guy, along with Lee Marvin, and a bunch of men in No Name City.  Then along comes Jean Seberg, gorgeous, and married to a Mormon who has another wife, so, upon demand of the lonely men, up for auction.  Tit for tat, so to speak, Jean is eventually interested in having two husbands.But it's a 3-hour film, and that's when I fell asleep.  Memory and Wikipedia assure me that all hell broke loose and literally swallowed up this Gold Rush boom town with fancy ladies in it from a kidnapped stage coach, etc.  I didn't actually get to hear Lee Marvin sing \"Wand'rin' Star\" in his wonderful drunken gravel, but I did hear Clint Eastwood sing \"I Talk to the Trees.\"  The plot of the film is quite different from that of the stage musical, which I've never seen.  Does anybody do that anymore?And to bring in a pertinent book, I own and have read Played Out: The Jean Seberg Story, a biography by David Richards, given to me by my parents one Christmas.  They were frequently giving me biographies and autobiographies of actresses during my own high-school musical years, and, back then, it was sort of hard to read why...  Were they supporting me in my vague career choice, or warning me?  Played Out is certainly a cautionary tale.In retrospect, of course, I see that 1) my parents were always supporting me, but 2) wanted me to be clear eyed about the realities of a career in the theatre, and 3) probably hadn't read these books themselves.  But, hey, the front flap of the dustjacket starts, \"Jean Seberg was forty when a policeman in the 16th arrondissement in Paris discovered her disintegrating body under a crumpled blanket in the back seat of white Renault.\" And Seberg took up writing later in life.  Hmm.  1) Thank God I've never played St. Joan (Seberg's first big role, after those high school plays she starred in, and, alas, a major film flop) and 2) Thank God (whatever God is) that, at 40, I just pierced my ears."},

Other Cole Porter songs were added to try to make it more popular, but it never fared too well, so my DVD mishap seems to fit right in (like Jesus, on a bus).Wikipedia tells us that Nikita Kruschev happened to visit Hollywood during the filming of Can-Can and was scandalized, using it to damn Americans for their depravity, sort of like the self-righteous judge in the plot except that he forgot to fall in love with Shirley Maclaine. (Whenever I mention Nikita Kruschev, I have to mention that I looked a lot like him as a baby.  A cross between Kruschev and Buddy Hackett, due to the black hair standing straight up on my head when I was born.  Fortunately it fell out.  And, yes, Buddy Hackett was in The Music Man.)"},

This all somehow fits together so well I am afraid to mention that last night I (semi-) watched How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying, in which the main character walks around holding a book with that title, by Shepherd Mead, which satirizes the striving and gamesmanship of the business world and works as sort of a cautionary tale, once you add the music and romance.The random coincidii just continue. American Gods is also about the business-as-usual world of power and money, except that it exposes the \"new gods\" of money, technology, celebrity, etc. as having displaced the old gods of various mythologies that immigrants brought to the United States in a kind of mythic journey to...what? restore them?  (I know some of you have read this, and also I suspect the novel ends in some suspended way that probably suggests a sequel? Or more to come? Or interpretation?) And Shepherd Mead also wrote some fantasy/scifi/America thing, where animalistic ETs impregnate the women of the world.  I hope nobody makes a musical of that.American Gods seems to be re-seeing and developing the idea, explored by others, that certain creatures--fairies, gods, elves--exist only as long as people believe in them.  Then other versions of reality or, in this case, \"gods\" take their place.  I remember this as an aspect of The Mists of Avalon, for instance.  So, all you Gaiman readers and fantasy readers can set me straight and/or recommend other books.  Feel free.But, wait, wasn't I talking about a musical earlier? Fun and corporate games?  (And Cokie Roberts?)1) Founding Mothers, by Cokie Roberts, is full of \"tough women,\" says Mary, connected to those founding fathers of the USA.2) Mary says that the Gaiman book is \"very strange.\"3) How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying has had various revivals since its first Broadway run and since the film, which features teased hair and blue eyeshadow.  The 1995 revival had Matthew Broderick in it, and Wikipedia tells me Harry Potter, er, Daniel Radcliffe, will star in a 2011 revival, coming right up in February.  (Julie, of A Follow Spot, is this true?!)"},

I've written here about Sinclair before, and he is a popular local read because he grew up here, renaming Bloomington, Illinois, and fictionalizing it as Everton, as you can read here.And there's more about him here, at the McLean County Museum of History, including pictures! One is with John Wayne on the set of The Horse Soldiers.Speaking of movies and memory lane, and, as I told CollageMama, who has a fabulous \"Itty Bitty\" blog of collages, art projects with children, photos, and funny and poignant stories, and who reminded me of Twiggy and her eyelashes in it recently, last night I watched The Boyfriend, in the ongoing musicals project that is causing me to relive bits of childhood and adolescence and question my sanity.Now I was sure I had seen this movie the year we lived in England, in a really big movie theatre, from way up high in a balcony, and thus from very far away. Holy Eyelashes! That's because a lot of the actual scenes are from the vantage of a high-up balcony, watching actors overact a musical, with the assistant stage manager/understudy (Twiggy) going on for the star, while a movie scout looks on, fascinated and laughing!!So now I can't recall the actual circumstances of my film viewing, except that the timing suggests I really did see it in London!It's a strange and silly film directed by Ken Russell, and I can see me not being able to follow it the first time I saw it, as the stage scenes morph into fully imagined film scenes in the minds of the stage director and film scout, and also into an outdoor bacchanal at one point. I do recall Twiggy as the spirit of ecstasy, and I knew that was Glenda Jackson (the star with the broken leg)!  Wikipedia tells me The Boyfriend was released in the U.S. in a shorter version and that it was never released on DVD, so I don't know what I've got here, but it has some damage in the middle, a few digitized puzzle-piece moments. (VHS at Amazon.)But it's worth keeping for the fabulous dance scenes by Tommy Tune, who tells a little story about being a child star during his American years....And anybody who thinks I am going to say anything embarrassing about anybody's actual boyfriend can just breathe a sigh of...wiener.  (Don't worry, it's an \"in\" joke.)"},

I wish I could hang Donna Vorreyer's beautiful flower on my Valentine tree.And how 'bout that belly button? I read Womb/Seed/Fruit too quickly, and too spottily, like the flower, when it first arrived, because I had recently encountered Donna's poems-in-process in the blogosphere and wanted to know her story. So now I've read it again, more slowly.If you are a poet yourself, she is providing poetry prompts in her new blog, Put Words Together. Make Meaning. And that's something that happens consistently in this chapbook! She puts words together to make meaning, not just for show! That is, she is able to balance telling with showing, and the book has a narrative arc predicted by its title and organization into 3 sections: Womb, Seed, Fruit.We hear the story of a womb that will not function as hoped, in poems with such titles as \"Diagnosis,\" \"Empty Handed,\" Misconception,\" and \"Barren Avenue.\" Even the titles tell you what you need to know, and the poems give you the images and feeling and hard thoughts to go with this difficult tale.And then the beginnings of change and possibility in the Seed section, which ends in this insight, gleaned from travel to the ocean, the fondling of a shell:...Perhaps this isall it takes to understand the nature of things,how they are reborn in different light,how something stirs in the deep fissuresof the heart, seeps through, overflows.And then there is Fruit!  Poems of the son, of the mother, of empathy with other mothers. Womb, seed, fruit, and that marvelous flower on the cover.The tropical flower might remind you of South Pacific, but last night I watched The Music Man, and enjoyed its special magic. The \"think system\" allows the blue-sky salesman's flim-flam plan...ah, with the help of real love, to bear fruit!  And fancy red uniforms!Meredith Willson, who wrote the book--which I just happen to have, in a Fireside Theatre Book Club edition, with pictures of Robert Preston and Barbara Cook as Professor Harold Hill and Marian the Librarian--does a brilliant job of showing and telling in that opening song with salesmen on the train. Their voices speed up as the train gets going, building in urgency and speed as they tell how this fake professor is ruining the reputation of other traveling salesmen, and then slow down again, and hiss like steam, as the train comes to a halt. And off jumps Harold Hill!And, speaking of travel, check out Donna Vorreyer's poem \"Navigation\" in the new issue of The Literary Bohemian, an online journal dedicated to travel!"},

Now I am going to have to check and see if we have a copy of The Fabulous Fanny at Babbitt's, on our Star Bio or Entertainment or Theatre History shelves.And while \"fanny\" is a fine euphemism for \"bottom\" in American slang, be careful saying it in Great Britain.  Or Little Britain, for that matter."},

In fact, I have actually handled the upside-down book version that puts the scripts for each in the same paperback, upside down from each other!I did not get far into the watching of this last night before I fell asleep...(it had been a long, cold day at the bookstore--no heat at Babbitt's--and at junior high volleyball afterwards), but I did see the stunning overhead views of New York that open the film (after the changing colors of the overture) and the spectacular opening dancing.  \"When you're a Jet, you're a Jet all the way!\"And I saw Tony and Maria fall in love at the dance in the gym.But I am in love with We Followed Our Hearts to Hollywood, by Emily Kimbrough, an account of going to Hollywood with Cornelia Otis Skinner to consult on the making of Our Hearts Were Young and Gay, a film based on the book of the same name that these two very funny young women wrote together about a trip to Europe.  I fell in love with the wild ramble on the two dustjacket flaps, and with the opening account of Emily buying a gigantic window display valentine to take on the train to Hollywood to meet up with Cornelia, and then, I gather, being trapped in her train berth with it.I would love to snap this book up, intact dustjacket and all, but 1) it's $18 and 2) you might want it or 3) Kim and I should go halvsies on it and then write our own quirky rambling account of some upcoming roadtrip, and then figure out who's going to play us in the movie version."},

Nicholas next, might just read the Edmund de Waal book from yesterday's entry first, due to the book review in the Guardian. (See his comment!) Both are about lost art, the Nazi threat to art, and saving art in and after wartime.And I might just have to read Tales of the South Pacific, that famous book of interconnected short stories by James Michener, after viewing South Pacific, the filmed musical, last night. A bit about why I am watching all these musicals: we have stacks of CDs, many taped from special cable television showings, inherited from a family friend who died a few years ago, and some were rain-damaged while stored in, and briefly, covered in plastic tarp, just outside, a garage.  So I am viewing to see which survived, and which are irretrievably damaged. (Gigi was irretrievably damaged, but I got the gist of it, and can go back and read the Colette short story for more. This one intrigued me as our son's first babysitter was nicknamed Gigi, by her mother, our son's second babysitter, who had seen the movie!) So I am also revisiting my childhood and adolescence, seeing again some movies I had imperfectly remembered.... And I think I first saw South Pacific on a black and white tv, and never experienced the strange intense color manipulation of this particular film. There's the vivid Technicolor of much of the film, in its gorgeous tropical setting (Hawaii, for the filming), but also scenes given a color filter so they appear golden, or pinkish gold, or bluish, etc.And Mitzi Gaynor is fine, but I grew up on the Mary Martin recording, so she's my favorite. Mary Martin as Peter Pan, Mary Martin as Maria von Trapp, Mary Martin as Nellie Forbush, and Mary Martin as Agnes in I Do! I Do! I love Mary Martin and her slightly raspy, rich full-bodied voice.

Wikipedia alerts me that some songs were left out of a \"re-release\" of the film, but, while I do sometimes fall asleep during home viewings (and while I did), I do remember hearing both \"Far From the Home I Love\" and \"Anatevka.\"  I did not hear \"Now I Have Everything,\" though, because it really was cut from the film.Grew up on the Broadway cast album and just loved \"Miracle of Miracles,\" sung by the tailor Motel Kamzoil, played by Austin Pendleton, an actor I love (and got to meet once, when he directed me in a play!!).Wikipedia tells me that the title Fiddler on the Roof comes from Marc Chagall's painting, The Fiddler.  And I already knew the play was based on stories by Sholem Aleichem about Tevye the milkman.Now it is snowing, I forgot to eat breakfast, and off I go.Please look at Joe Wilkins's poems in Escape Into Life today!

Books will never go out of style!So, yes, they found a Readers Digest condensed (but not overly condensed) hardcover Pickwick Papers, green with gold lettering, that will make some nice English major a fine purse.Sarah Jane made me laugh over in her blog, the rain in my purse, discussing the new changes in the horoscope.  When in a mocking mood, and referring to my online or newspaper horoscope-for-today, I call this the horrorscope, and think what a nice paying job that must be, writing those little snippets \"for entertainment purposes only,\" but the rest of the time, I love astrology.I see it as astronomy + mythology = astrology, and think those ancients were definitely observing something and some patterns, however they chose to interpret it.It's like a farmer saying, \"The trees know it's going to rain.\"  They've seen the leaves turn over, they know a storm is coming, and they've personified the trees.  There's another, more scientific reason for the leaves turning over, yes, there's an explanation for the phenomenon, but the farmers and the trees are right.  It is going to rain. Etc.Why is it so easy for me to suspend two kinds of interpretations of reality?  Let them float like dust motes and water vapor in the air?I don't for a moment take mythical and metaphorical truths as literal reality.  I guess, as with other things, I don't see them in competition.  It's an odd collaboration and cooperation in my odd mind.Of course, as Sarah Jane notes about the \"fraud and mass deception\" aspect, I don't want anyone to be duped, nor another American president whose wife is running the country with astrology. My suspension is indeed water vapor and dust, before real rain.It's like dream interpretation.  If I remember my dream in the morning and look at it, I am asking myself, \"Hmm, what's on my mind?\"  I think it's fun to find out what dream symbols \"mean\" and to bounce them off Jungian archetypes and universal symbols, etc., but I guess I think it's mostly going to turn out to be another personal prism, and help me ponder something I already was pondering, or see it now in a clearer light, uh, daylight, in fact.When dream symbols and psychological archetypes and astrological patterns turn out to be shared, and to ring true, I imagine there's something there, and I stand back in awe, aware that I don't have the full explanation yet, if there is one.  And if it's a mystery, it's a mystery I don't try to solve on my own.For instance, in my poem \"Large Hadron Collider,\" about the underground collider and the particles racing around for the scientists in real life, with surely dire import, I am also using the prism of a tarot card reading to try and understand what's going on in the outer world and the inner world.  I think, on the particular night of the poem's making, I was trying to find something, and to focus.  So I put together not being able to find the book-in-a-box-with-tarot-cards on the shelf, my heart, and the real meaning that will come from the collider experiment, which I cannot know, by laying out a tarot reading, and trying to interpret it.  Hence, the poem.Which surely has some meaning, other than this account of the process, which you can interpret on your own.Of course, I love it when, as in a comic play by Oscar Wilde, all clues point toward one delightful conclusion. \"Is this the hand-bag, Miss Prism?\"  She is so glad to have the hand-bag restored.  And the lovers can marry each other, and live happily ever after, uttering ridiculous witticisms!!Oh, Karen, who has new bookcases, to fit in more literal books, but who can no longer fit The Importance of Being Earnest into her syllabus, I feel for you!"},

It begins:Let the thunder clamor above and continueafter lightning has licked the heavy air.(Anyone who has seen a storm begin in the Midwest has seen this licking, felt this heavy air.  Somehow the poem turns me into the lightning, changes my tongue.)This is not a haunting.  I mean to be awakeand wide-eyed--to be both owl and field mousecaught in strobes of light.(Now the poem reveals an intention--to look and listen closely, to learn from the storm, to enter its characters, which turn out to be predator and prey.)The clock pushes past midnight, then one,then two, and I am counting backwardsinto what is left as the bruises fade.(Ever had a sleepless night like this, storm or no?  The phrase \"counting backwards\" took me to anesthesia for an operation, and those \"bruises\" and dull residual pain, but then I came back to the \"strobes of light\" of the previous stanza and the bruises were on the wall, as light and shadow.)One man told me love was a transitive verb,worrying me like a rosary bead to prove it.Another man stood me in the middle of Nebraskato prove the Permian seas once stretchedfrom Pittsburgh to Denver, home to creatureswe read about with our stone-caressing fingersbut could never know.  The last man was a thief,his voice a prayer to a god so exotic I bloodiedmy knees falling down before them both.(Wow.  Heart of the poem.  A list of lovers, or heart teachers.  Thudding like thunder into the room.  Bringing history and science, somehow archaeology and religion.  The earlier bruises have prepared me, somehow, to fall down, bloodied.)This is a recounting.  I mean to be accurateand true--to be both diary and documentheld open and up to the light.(I love the distinction between \"accurate / and true\" and the quiet insistence on \"both diary and document.\"  This stanza returns to the intentionality of stanza two and its \"I mean to be awake.\"  She is going to see it and say it, while listening to the storm in the dark.  It is, after all, a \"recitation.\")Let the storm pass, dawn taming the landscapeoutside my room, leaves and branches looseningback into the shapes of trees.(I've been up all night with the speaker of the poem.  Now it is daylight, the world is as it was, but I have seen  the truth, heard the inner storm as well as the outer, so it is also transformed by that.)To return to Lockward's poetry-book reading advice, you can also see this poem in light of the book's title, Blood Almanac, and bloodied knees and weather resound again in that context, of crucial calendar and the detailed information necessary for survival.Now, to ramble back over to the volleyball tournament, I did read between matches, but what I was reading was Never Let Me Go, by Kazuo Ishiguro, which I could barely put down.  As the Time blurb on the cover says, it's \"a page-turner and a heartbreaker.\"  I have a feeling my mom picked this one up at Babbitt's when she got his book Remains of the Day, because she said she got two of his and that one was \"like nothing I've ever read before\" and didn't say much else, so read the book and you'll know why and won't want to give anything away, either.And, finally, I am honored to appear in the new issue of Blue Five Notebook with four other fine pieces and fabulous art.  I am particularly tickled to have appeared as the last broadside of Blue Fifth Review, and the first poem in Blue Five Notebook, its new incarnation.  I came to e-zines late (technology challenge, busy teaching, editing, and childrearing), but I am glad to be here now!"},
{"title": "A Farewell to Huckleberry Finn", "date": "Saturday, January 15, 2011", "text": "Day 341 of the \"What are you reading, and why?\" project, and I told you I might tell you why John, from yesterday's blog entry, wanted a copy of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, by Mark Twain. He had heard that it might never be the same again. He already has a copy of The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, the one everybody is talking about, all text intact. The issue is the \"n-word\" and most teachers and people I talk to are upset, call it censorship, and are not happy about the new edition, coming out from NewSouth Books in February, that will replace the \"n-word\" with the word \"slave.\"I tried to reassure John that many editions will still contain the text as it was written, and this one is apparently designed for teaching, for young people, for \"community reads,\" and, as far as I can tell, to avoid controversy of the sort that gets the book removed from the American literature curriculum and/or takes up a lot of time to combat or explain, when teachers are trying to teach and libraries are trying to promote reading of classic or favorite texts. In short, to make sure the book is still read in the 21st century. Looks like it will be, and that the current controversy has created a demand for the original text.  For both Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer.I only just recently learned (or re-learned if I had known and forgotten) that A Farewell To Arms, by Ernest Hemingway, has always been published in its \"censored\" format, substituting dashes for some particularly offensive swear words. I was handling a facsimile of the first edition at work, and, sure enough, there were the dashes.Wikipedia lists the omitted words, if you are interested, and also tells us that Hemingway wrote the words back in by hand on two copies, given to Maurice Coindreau and James Joyce. Hemingway's three censored swear words are among \"the seven words you can never say on television\" made so famous by George Carlin. Those are also seven words I am not going to use in a classroom, as is the \"n-word.\" But I can read the \"n-word\" on a page, assign a book or essay that contains it, and handle student papers that repeat it, though I always give my students the choice of rendering it as the \"n-word\" if they prefer. And I give them the choice of whether to speak it aloud, although I won't say it myself. Discussing this issue has always allowed us to learn a lot from each other in my college classrooms, and I think many high school classrooms can handle it just fine, too. Young people today impress me very much with their generosity, easy acceptance of one another's differences, and general laid-backness, but there's also a lot of crap and bullying going on out there, so I guess we'd better stay alert.I just hope we tolerate the new edition and it helps in the places it's meant to help. It certainly would solve the  problem of teachers having to provide an alternate text when someone objects to the assigned text. Assign Huckleberry Finn, and if anyone objects, offer NewSouth's edition as the alternate text. Then have the usual conversations and lessons in class.For that matter, a purist who wants to make a point could ask for an alternate text if this edited one is assigned.  The original.  On and on it goes.Maybe it just seems easy to me.  Nobody can \"whitewash\" Huckleberry Finn, not really. What's there is there, and will still be there after the NewSouth edition is set aside. Huckleberry Finn grew up in racist times and was transformed by close association with Jim.  He came to understand that this man was not anything he might be labeled but a fully human being.I won't be buying the new edition.  I won't be saying the \"n-word,\" either, but I won't try to prevent its use in texts and lyrics.  People who say it can, as long as they can accept the consequences of doing so.I won't be saying those seven words on television any time soon. Nor, most of them, around the house.I doubt I will ever celebrate the word \"bitch\" the way many women now do, though I admire and support those strong women who choose to use it to transform it, just the way the \"n-word\" has been transformed in some of its uses, though it's good to remember the \"n-word\" has always had different meanings in different contexts, both historically and now; unfortunately, the insult attached to it is always with us.And I doubt I will ever accept the \"c-word\" that is used to insult women.  The Vagina Monologues did not convince me on the issue of the \"c-word.\"  I will say \"vagina\" and \"penis\" out loud and in print. There you have them. They are body parts. But I won't just toss them around to be silly. Oh. Yes, I will.And, by the way, Tom Sawyer's got this fence he won't let you paint."},

(I think I saved the wife.)Anyway, in John's fabulous stack was a book from the floor that I had been lusting after as I passed it day after day, The Book of Love, an anthology edited by Diane Ackerman and Jeanne Mackin. \"I'm a hopeless romantic,\" said John.Further evidence: the stack included Don Quixote, our favorite fighter of windmills, by Cervantes, which, by random coincidence, a young man had bought in paperback earlier in the day!  And Lincoln and the Court, by Brian McGinty, an account of Abraham Lincoln and the Supreme Court and their constitutional and legal \"battles\" during the Civil War.  We also looked for and found a hardcover Tom Sawyer, by Mark Twain.  More about that, perhaps, tomorrow.But now I will tell about what I love to do, respond to a snippet of conversation by turning and grabbing from the shelf behind me (the shelf of books I am about to list in our database) the perfect book for the person in front of me.  \"Oh, you'll want this!\" is the refrain.John had just asked, \"Do you have True Grit?\" as he had just seen the movie.\"We used to have one in the window [full circle return to image of John in the window!!].  Sorry, it sold right away,\" I said, turning to the shelf behind me. \"But you'll want this!\"The Dog of the South, by Charles Portis!  First edition, hardcover with dustjacket.  John, if not his wife, is going to be glad he has that one!"},
{"title": "Abide With Me", "date": "Thursday, January 13, 2011", "text": "Day 339 of the \"What are you reading, and why?\" project, and my book group was just reading Abide With Me, by Elizabeth Strout, because I had suggested it. Why? Because I found it at hand in the bookstore, when everybody was reading Olive Kitteridge, which got the Pulitzer Prize, and here was this one I hadn't even heard of, with a little girl on the cover, and a blurb on the back setting it in a small town with a main character of a pastor. Hey, we live in a small town, and a member of our book group is a pastor!So we met last night to discuss it, and 1) Yes, the gossipy nature of small towns does affect pastoral life and 2) We are not a bunch of ladies who drink coffee. There were six bottles of wine on the table and three in the fridge.But what happens at book group stays at book group, so you won't hear any juicy gossip from me. Maybe.What I really like about this book is how we gradually get to know the people of the town enough to see that the \"perfect\" people aren't, and the most unlikable characters are human and have something to love and protect in them. We see how they got that way, but we only see as much as is revealed by the people themselves via the omniscient narrative voice.Usually a \"godlike\" point of view, this is a subtle omniscience that moves around as needed and still doesn't tell us everything. Mysteries remain. Just as they do with the people we think we know well, the marriages we observe.  Outside the book.  So this rang true to me, as fine literary fiction. This is the kind of book I read to learn how to live, something I said at the beginning of this \"musing on reading\" project. I read everything that way, but this is the kind of book that actually helps me.So it was quite wonderful to find at the back of my paperback edition--one of those Reader's Guide editions, with questions--\"A Note About Abide With Me\" by the author herself, saying, \"In telling my stories, I am--as Tyler Caskey [the pastor] is--interested in the question: How does one live life? Does it even matter how one lives?\" I was feeling spoken to as I read along.\"Whether we approach life as Tyler does, with the question of how love can best be served, or whether we approach it with some other central issue, either of our own making or given to us by a religious guideline, most of us are still dismayed by how imperfectly we love, we are still surprised by the consequence of action, we are often at sea with questions of right and wrong.\"Hitting home, and still ringing true. My mom lives with the central question of how love can best be served, and she came to this by living, by reading, by raising children, by being an English teacher. That is, she might not have started that way, but she lives in love now. I knew her parents, though, so indeed she might have started that way!In college, my central question was that of political philosophy: \"How should men and women best live together on this earth?\" What are the crucial values, based on what discernible truths, and what are the equitable and practicable arrangements for supporting them?\"At sea seems to me an honest place to be,\" Strout continues in her Note, and I agree. \"My job as a storyteller,\" she says, \"is not to supply any answers, but to raise the questions in a way the reader may not have seen before--to record in a different manner what it means to desire what we desire, to fail the way we fail, to hope the way we hope.\"And now, for the \"river of stones\" people, another fine rock coincidence: In trying to describe her personal beliefs, Strout says they are \"like huge, smooth rocks that shift, sharply at times, as I run my hands over them, looking at them from different angles, always trying to keep the moss of cynicism and sentimentality from obscuring them.\" Love that!Then, oddly, or not so oddly, given all the wine, we behaved as if at a slumber party and called somebody's boyfriend!

Nathan Ferree makes cool robots from clay, etc. at Cyborg Clayworks, and Steppenwolf Theatre is doing Heddatron in their Garage Rep series, Hedda Gabler for robots. Chicago area Susan, you should go see that!Spektor Factor:  My daughter gave me some Regina Spektor CDs for Christmas, and I am in love with her voice and lyrics and want them as background to my imagination and incorporated into various soundtracks. Oh, wait! They are. Her music is already on tv commercials and shows and in movie soundtracks, but I definitely think of Cyborgia when I hear \"Machine.\" \"Blue Lips\"--with blue as the most human color, and \"the color of our planet from far, far away\"--and \"Genius Next Door\" haunt me. Wikipedia tells me that Spektor is writing the music for Beauty, the Grimm fairy tale set to music for Broadway in 2011-2012. Julie, please go see that and report on it in A Follow Spot!Double Feature:  Over the holidays, we had a family wamily movie marathon and happened to watch The Road, based on the book by Cormac McCarthy, and Where the Wild Things Are, based on the book by Maurice Sendak, on consecutive evenings.\"Oh,\" I said, after the second viewing. \"Where the Wild Things are is The Road for kids.\"  If you do this as a double feature, you will see what I mean. But, of course, they are not the same at all. But you will see.About The Road, my husband said, \"The book was better\" in a sort of humorous immediate way, so I pursued him on this the next morning, and he said he got the sense of desolation more purely from the book.  \"You'd think a movie would do that better,\" he said, meaning the visual opportunities, and he thought the film did it well, but somehow the book's bleakness got to him more. Both my son and my husband had pictured the scene in the woods, with the guy peeing, exactly as it happened in the film. Likewise, the ocean. The ocean scene was exactly as I had pictured it, too, in my reading. I must have blocked from my mind some blood and innards elsewhere in the book, because there they were, inescapable, in the movie.Sweets for the Sweet:  After that appetizing image, I offer sweet coincidii:  I happened to listen to Regina Spektor's \"Man of a Thousand Faces\" which has the word \"sweet\" in it, after writing yesterday's \"sweet\" blog, and Sara Gazarek's \"Blackbird/Bye Bye Blackbird\" mashup on the radio on the way to work, which is also sweet. You can hear Sara's sweet voice if you click on her website, here, and have your speakers on. Of course, it is a little freaky to me that as soon as I put up the robot arm by Nathan Ferree as today's blog image, Sara Gazarek started singing, \"Reach out your hand....\""},

A sweet woman called us at the bookstore as soon as we opened yesterday to say that she'd found two books (on our search page) that she'd been looking for ever since childhood.We located them for her, and before we could call her back, she called to say she was on her way (she lives about half hour down the road), and that she had a list of other Tennyson in her pocket. She called from her car, noise in the background (radio? grown son? talking GPS system?), and once I realized that, I said, \"We'll talk when you get here.\" And we did, a bit, and I pulled three more Tennyson books from the counter shelves where we store the pretty ones (thanks to Sarah; see also the vintage valentines!), and the boss took her into the rare book room, where she found some more, and she was one happy lady. I think this might have been part of her son's Christmas gift for her, because she mentioned that she found her Mother's Day gift in our store, too, and told him what he had gotten her on that occasion!Alfred, Lord Tennyson was the poet laureate of England after William Wordsworth and was beloved by many, even those who did not get speeding tickets! He wrote short lyrics and long narrative poems, often incorporating myth, legend, and history, as in the very well known \"Charge of the Light Brigade.\"  (Poor them...it's the story of a tough battle and stupid military situation during the Crimean War.)The lovely lady weaving is Tennyson's \"Lady of Shallot\" as painted by John William Waterhouse.  And here she is in her boat, sick in love with Lancelot."},
{"title": "Metaphysical Magi", "date": "Monday, January 10, 2011", "text": "Day 336 of the \"What are you reading, and why?\" project, and yesterday I did talk to people about what they were reading, but I posted my poem just because that seemed all I could do and because we were probably all reading the news, the followups, the updates, or listening to it.  I heard the first reports on NPR, traveling to and from the volleyball tournament.  Thanks to all for the wisdom and comfort in your comments here.To follow up with Harry, he has been reading George Herbert, one of the metaphysical poets, and had asked me if there was another name for poems like Herbert's poem that begins, \"Lord, who createdst man in wealth and store, / Though foolishly he lost the same, / Decaying more and more...\"  Hmm, which does fit right in with the weekend's horror.Herbert's poem, in the shape of wings, has come to be known as \"Easter Wings,\" and I found it in Five Metaphysical Poets, by Joan Bennett, which also discusses Donne, Vaughan, Crashaw, and Marvell.  It belonged to Christine Garrigan, who taught me Victorian Prose in graduate school at DePaul University, and this must be one of those free books professors put out on tables when they were cleaning out their offices.  I remember reading Ruskin with Professor Garrigan.To answer Harry, using the handy Handbook of Poetic Forms, published by Teachers & Writers and edited by Ron Padgett, the name for this kind of poetry is often simply \"shaped poetry\" or \"pattern poetry.\"  The term \"concrete poetry,\" which we often apply to shaped poetry, is associated with a particular modern branch of it and sometimes to poems that depend entirely on their shape on the page for their impact and effects.  Herbert's poems can also stand on their own, content-wise, but become themselves more fully in their shapes.But the T&W book did provide me with the name Harry had been searching for: calligram, a form developed by Guillaume Apollinaire in his book Calligrammes, which contains the beautiful \"It's Raining,\" which looks like it's raining.I do love the Handbook of Poetic Forms, which provides definitions and summaries of the history of the form, examples (often modern variations on it), and pronunciations! Oddly, I have been corrected on my pronunciation of, say, cento, but it is SEN-toe, as I had always said it, and means \"patchwork,\" and is the basic collage poem, once again popular.  It is, apparently, sometimes confused with the Italian for a hundred (CHEN-toe), and sometimes leads to 100-line collage poems, but SEN-toe is correct for the patchwork collage poem, if anyone was wondering, or worried!And yesterday a young man picked out The Magus, by John Fowles, as he had always wanted to read some Fowles. \"Oh, this is a revision!\" I said, opening to the title page. \"Do you know what he's revised?\"But then we simultaneously pointed to the new foreword by the author and realized Fowles would tell us.  I think the young man will, too, when he returns. I am interested because I loved reading The Magus but felt somehow cheated by the ending, and maybe the revision and foreword address this. **pause to check Wikipedia article**Nope, Fowles probably leaves the indeterminate ending; the foreword credits the sources. Which leads me to that story I always tell about reading The French Lieutenant's Woman at the time I was getting my wisdom teeth removed and writing a completely different third ending to the novel in my head, under gas. Wikipedia alerted me to the film version, and Michael Caine's and Woody Allen's humorous complaints about it."},

I think Dani (of Dewey and Dani) picked up the Sedaris, Squirrel Seeks Chipmunk, which sounds like it could do a lot of mayhem in the animal world.And I have just finished The Fine Art of Literary Mayhem, by Myrick Land, A Lively Account of Famous Writers & Their Feuds.  It was a lively account, and I liked it even more than Literary Feuds: A Century of Celebrated Quarrels, by Anthony Arthur.  But they both sort of freak me out, and they worked into my conversation with Harry, a philosopher who has lived through postmodernism and beyond.One wants to hear Buzz Lightyear say that!  Or, as a literary critic might render it, Buzzword Lightweight! No, really, Harry and I were discussing the harm literature and criticism can do one another if each is struggling to elevate itself above the other.  But while there were certainly feuds between rival writers and critics and writers, this Literary Mayhem book is also remarkable for conveying that sense of respect and responsibility that writers and critics have felt toward one another at various times. And it made me look up the word \"mayhem\" which I had associated with riotous disorder and wild confusion but which actually means \"the offense of wilfully crippling or maiming a person,\" which, indeed, some of  the feuding writers did, figuratively, to one another.  And there were some fistfights.Or \"wanton destruction\" which makes us think of the streets after the Michigan vs. Ohio game.A milder example of mayhem given by my American Heritage dictionary is children in the garden, but then ponder all those broken stems and beheaded flowers, and we are back to the maiming.\"Ah, love, let us not maim one another.\"  Uh oh, I've just maimed Matthew (\"Sweetness and Light\") Arnold.For \"Dover Beach,\" read by David Kirby, go here.  For more on Matthew Arnold, go here or here.

(OK, last year I left it up till Valentine's Day, reducing and replacing its decorations appropriately to fit the new red holiday, and I liked that, so I will probably do it again.)I have at hand Epiphany School, poems by Chris Green, and also, finally, The Alchemist's Kitchen, by Susan Rich, and Among Women, by Jason Shinder, and I hope to have little revelations while reading these, but I am still enjoying the revealed world in Blood Almanac, by Sandy Longhorn, for now.And the January issue of The Sun has arrived, a gift from my friend Kim, so I have read the revelations in the Readers Write section and the poems already! People are so wise and wonderful, so vulnerable, so generous. When we can make this manifest--our combined vulnerability and generosity--ah! that is a world to live in.But over at Facebook, S. Jane provided a link to a devastating short film on our Chernobyl Legacy, at Mediastorm, which reminds us of the other things we have made manifest in our world.

Some of the post-its are figurative instead of literal (see above) and on some days all post-its are lost, and the brain is oatmeal.  Without melted butter and brown sugar.But I can tell you that a birthday girl is going to be reading a collection of Edgar Allan Poe soon, because her friend just bought it for her, along with a non-fiction book on ghosts and hauntings. And before Christmas, another fine Poe collection went out as a gift for a young woman. Poe is a perennial favorite, to be sure.And I can tell about the Moleskin Project at Escape Into Life, where artists and writers are creating image and word journals as works of art! If you are interested, you can join at any time.And just up today at Escape Into Life is a poetry feature by Nic Sebastian, with marvelous art by Ruud Van Empel! Nic Sebastian is a poet who also does wonderful work reading aloud the works of others at Whale Sound, blogs at Very Like a Whale, and runs a community blog at Voice Alpha, always clickable in the blogroll at right.I got my Moleskine at Borders, half price in the half-price-on-all-calendars sale, also using a half-price coupon on an Illinois road map picked out by my husband, so he can put an updated Illinois on the wall above the phone for ease in navigating road trips to away volleyball tournaments. Alas! We opened it up and Illinois had been cut in half! Northern half on one side, southern on the other. No good, no good!I looked for words on the outside of the map, warning of this, and there were none. So back to Borders he will go, with the receipt and my credit card, and there may be no way to know if Illinois will be whole on the wall.Meanwhile, Borders is also in woe, and might end up a hole in the wall.And, speaking of moles and holes, yesterday I handled an ex-library copy of The Wind in the Willows, by Kenneth Grahame, illustrated by Tasha Tudor.  I am very fond of Mole in that story, but have only played a weasel, a field mouse, and the barge woman in a musical adaptation of it.Maybe someday, I can play Mole!An unlikely post-it."},
{"title": "Talking Books", "date": "Tuesday, January 4, 2011", "text": "Day 330 of the \"What are you reading, and why?\" project, and today's blog title, \"Talking Books,\" is not about audio books but about book talk in the bookstore, which just keeps happening. I talked with Bob, who is opposed to big bookstores for the way they treat authors and small presses and small indie bookstores and who will remain in love with print. He had come in to compare the contents of his Oscar Wilde collection of short prose writings with ours, at Babbitt's, to see if there was too much duplication, and there wasn't, so he bought it. He pointed out to me Wilde's long list of articles on women and then told me about Lewis Carroll's huge library of books about women. Somehow this follows nicely on yesterday's \"Thrilling Men.\"Then a fine fellow came in and bought a collection of fantasy and science fiction short stories by women. This book is the Penguin Book of Modern Fantasy by Women, which will save you the embarrassment of search words that bring up books about women's erotic fantasy...not that there's anything wrong with that. A fine Amazon reviewer has gone to the trouble of listing the entire table of contents for you (title and author!) and given individual star-based reviews and hilarious labels that summarize the subject matter: \"Taxi horror,\" \"Swanflict,\" \"Smart sheep look dumb,\" \"Grow up or be eaten.\" Makes me want to read books by the reviewer.But our customer has been reading all kinds of short stories for the past five years! He thinks he'll get back to novels eventually, but he really enjoys the short form, which can fit into his life in the evening, and he reads a whole range, having gone through a lot of science fiction, horror, and general literary fiction in that time. (And if you, too, like short stories, be sure to check out I Heart Short Stories in the blogroll!)Speaking of fantasy and science fiction, does anybody know the book Metatopia by F. N Ball? If so, please weigh in. A young man found it on our sci fi shelves yesterday, where it does seem to belong, but he wanted to know if it does any kind of spin on Sir Thomas More's Utopia, and that I could not tell him. Our attempts to Google it led us inexorably toward the Fun Ball, alas, or the Fantasy Sports Fanball.Anyhoo, I asked the young man, eager to read it, to come back and tell me about it, and I think he will. The other guy will also come back and tell me how he liked Modern Fantasy by Women, and maybe turn it back in for trade for another book of short stories. It is fun to talk books!And this morning, in the river of stones project, I paid attention to the \"cheep talk\" of juncos in the evergreen bush right outside my home office window.And, following up on New Year's resolutions, I am happy to be supporting poetry in today's \"live\" review of Stepping Through Moons, by Toni Wilkes, at Fiddler Crab Review. And yesterday my blog interview with Susan Slaviero about her book Cyborgia was linked in the Mayapple Press newsletter, a fun surprise!!"},

Women do, too, of course, and you'll recall the recent Sylvia Plath extravaganza, but I realized in bed this morning...pause*...that it is very often young men, some of them graduate students, doing some combination of private study and university project, who buy a series of books by one poet or a set of related poets.  (I see this as a local coincidence, not a gender fact.)For example, Jeffrey, yesterday, bought books by William Everson, Kenneth Rexroth, and Robert Creeley.  I think Robinson Jeffers would have rounded out the trio, but Jeffrey probably already has Robinson Jeffers, a California poet like Everson and Rexroth, though Jeffers is connected to Carmel and Big Sur, while the other two are connected to San Francisco.  Jeffers died in 1962, but the others were writing through the 1950s and 1960s, and snapping along with the Beat poets.  Brief Dalai Lama connection.  Everson converted to Catholicism and became the monk Brother Antonius.But Brother Antonius left monkery to marry a woman and later studied and edited Robinson Jeffers!Robert Creeley was from New England and is associated with Black Mountain College in North Carolina and Black Mountain Review, another strand in the poetry of the 1950s and 1960s, but he intersects with Allen Ginsberg, which brings us back to the Beats.  So there are thrilling connections here, though I think of Ginsberg's long \"Howl\" and Creeley's compression as a thrilling contrast in poetic styles.*pause to giggle, muse, whatever you like, but I was just thinking, and then I got up and made coffee.Oh, and did I mention the tall, handsome former body builder buying books yesterday on health and fitness?  We had a conversation about yoga and the common sense wisdom of many health writers of the past.  He was buying a book on body fitness first published in the late 1800's.  Wisdom in the past!  What a thrill."},
{"title": "True Confessions", "date": "Sunday, January 2, 2011", "text": "Day 328 of the \"What are you reading, and why?\" project, and I confess I am still going to tell you what I am reading, and pummel you with small glittery bits of coincidii, but I will surely talk to other people soon, probably as soon as this afternoon, at work, about what they are reading, and you can also check the blogroll to find lots of year-end book lists, plus all those \"best of\" lists at news sites, but I have been reading Blood Almanac, by Sandy Longhorn, and it's gorgeous, and, as is my wont, I want to share some stone coincidii, as the January river of stones ripples on...When I read the very first poem, \"Black Dirt Girls,\" I knew I would love this book, as I grew up on the fertile prairie, too, all that black dirt, and \"tall grasses, / bent by heads bursting with grain, were lit / with hosts of lightning bugs tilting like drunks.\"  Great image, huh?  We see the fireflies and the grasses, but it also sustains itself factually, with grain alcohol intoxicating the metaphorical heads of the prairie grasses, or wheat.Of course, I mostly saw the fireflies in corn rows, or hovering over beans, whatever was planted that particular year.  And still do, as my parents still live in the same place, and I spend lots of time at their farmhouse, in all seasons.Sandy Longhorn is a poet I have met here in the blogosphere--hers is the Kangaroo blog in the blogroll!-- and we exchanged books at Christmastime!  You can click to buy her book at her blog, or here, the Anhinga Press site, where you can also see sample poems and the full book design credits.  The cover photo is by George Byron Griffiths. And the title of her blog is an Emily Dickinson quotation, a memorable phrase from one of her letters to Thomas Wentworth Higginson.  So you know I was bound to love Sandy.  I sent her an Emily Dickinson collage bookmark with shiny rain and a button on it, and she sent me one of her poetry collage cards.  (So now I admire her ability with glue as well as poetry.)OK, and another coincidence of love--the title \"Black Dirt Girls\" is inspired by the title of an Emmylou Harris song, \"Red Dirt Girl,\" as Sandy says in the notes at the back of the book!  Yay, Emmylou!  I confess I have looked at the Notes before finishing the book--I am halfway through--as this is a full collection, not a chapbook, and I need to read it slowly and to re-read it; poetry takes great attention.Remember yesterday, attention, and that river of stones?  So here is what I wanted to tell you.  The poem \"Fence Line to Hill Rise\" tells about the boulders left behind by the Laurentide Ice Sheet, huge rocks that encounter the plow, glacial residue that contributes to the good black dirt, and then here's the last stanza:Smaller stones rise up each year,heaved to the surface by frostto clank against the disk blades,forcing us to reclaim the fields.The earth gives birth to what it wants,fodder for cairns at the fence corners.(Ah, again the words do their double work--\"frost\" is what it is, and the earth does what it does, and the rocks are there for building cairns, but in the background of this poem is Robert Frost's poem, somehow, \"Mending Wall,\" without any trouble at all--of course, Frost's name is its own metaphor--just \"echoes of receding ice.\")On a granite boulder in the poem \"Labor Day on the Bremer Blacktop\" you can see the \"sun catching mica flints / in the rock's grain, / dazzling as any city skyline at dusk.\"There was mica in yesterday's book, too, Stone for an Eye, by Karen Craigo, in poem VI:I like to think it's micathat glistens in this stone--they make windowsfrom mica, and that'sa handy metaphor.I first encountered mica, or \"fool's gold,\" in the Black Hills of South Dakota, and was forever charmed by it, still caught in the glitter of childhood memory.Back to Blood Almanac, and \"June,\" in which Sandy Longhorn provides a list poem, inspired by the structure of a Lucie Brock-Boido poem (credited under the title and in a note at the end of the book), of what \"I am,\" as \"June\" comes in a section of 12 self-portrait poems, each a month of the year.  In \"June,\"Am six river pebbles sucked dry...I'm just about to start the \"Listening in the Dark\" section now, which will contribute to my January attentiveness, I'm sure.  But here is an image and a stanza from \"December\" for you, that relates to Craigo's mica windows and the month we've all just finished:Winter is made of this muteness and these windowsand the long view of white fields through icy glasswhere nothing moves and nothing raises its voice.And now, dear reader, it's been a couple paragraphs since my last confession, so I will say that, while I confessed to not even knowing that True Grit was based on a book when all the hoopla about the film remake was going on, and people started wanting the book at Babbitt's, now that I have actually seen the new film, and been reminded of the book's original cover, I confess simply to memory challenge. As I was watching it, I remembered reading it! As a child, too young to get everything, but remembering the language and certain words--braggadocio--and having to look them up or ask my mom, and, oddly, the actual page and typeface. I probably got the book from the library. I remember being concerned about snakebite. And who recalls the snake in the grass scene from Elsie Dinsmore?! And, ah, Emily Dickinson...\"A narrow fellow in the grass.\" Anyhoo, I loved the film, seen yesterday at the theatre. I always forget how loud movie theatres are, but my mom didn't forget. She remembered not to wear her hearing aid!And what a delightful surprise at the end of the film to hear my girl, Iris Dement, singing \"Leaning on the Everlasting Arms\"! But if I start talking about Iris Dement, I'll never end this blog entry. Bye for now.Except to remind you that there's lots of blood in True Grit, and there will be more to come from the Blood Almanac!OK, one more tiny river-of-stones coincidental thing: this morning I paid attention to frost on the window glass! OK, two little things. Blood Almanac also makes me think fondly of \"Sestina\" by Elizabeth Bishop, with its recurring almanac!  OK, really, goodbye. You hang up.  No, you hang up."},
{"title": "Stone for an Eye", "date": "Saturday, January 1, 2011", "text": "Day 327 of the \"What are you reading, and why?\" project.  HAPPY NEW YEAR!!  It's the first day of 2011, and we're going to see True Grit this afternoon to celebrate with my mom and dad (who took me to see the original film, too).  Read the comments under Auld Acquaintance to see what a lot of people are reading as one year ends and another begins!Because today is also the beginning of the current river of stones project, and because I mentioned this book earlier, I want to share some poem excerpts from Stone for an Eye, by Karen Craigo, from the Wick Poetry Chapbook Series.  (This series is published at Kent State University in Ohio, coincidentally my mother's alma mater.)This book is 20 numbered poems, beginning with these lines:You won't live to writean elegy for a stone.I appreciate the line break, causing me to catch my breath at the idea that I won't live to write, before I carry on to the stone's permanence.  I am invited to praise the stone, and I do, and then told, \"Love / that it is humble, its raiment / plain\" and I do this, too, noting the word \"raiment\" and how the stone, so humble, is also now clothed in spiritual language.  \"Remember, it never flies / of its own volition.\"And then this:Assume the stone's great sadnessis the verb \"to stone.\"That is sad.  I can't help but think of Shirley Jackson's story, \"The Lottery,\" but last night I saw the film Dogville, so now I think of that, too.  The stone's great sadness is related to what people do with stones, which can be to harm one another.The poem ends, \"Don't make too much / of its attention.  The stone / is not listening to you.\"  I love the coldness of this.  And the human longing.  And the mention of \"attention,\" which is what the river of stones project is about, and what all poetry is about, to me.  Paying attention.Paying attention.  That is another thing humans do, and must do, and should do.  And sometimes don't do enough.  \"Attention must be paid,\" says Linda Loman in Death of a Salesman, by Arthur Miller.  And it must.  I may not live to write an elegy for a stone, but I hope to pay attention every day, and, in January, to write a little about it in a personal handwritten diary.  Sometimes I might tell you about it here, too. Yesterday I watched seven or eight squirrels run around the yard in the sixty-degree weather in the rain, running up and down the trunk of the sweetgum tree, running over to the evergreen shrub to leap out of it, running back to do it again.  A rabbit joined the fun for a moment, then sat and watched the squirrels, just as I was doing.  Ah, and it is the Year of the Rabbit, yes?\"Anyone can love nature,\" says Craigo in poem VIII:The trick is to lovethe world--loveits hunched-over people,each guarding somethingheavy and beautiful.Love even a Willy Loman, hunched over in his pain.  Love the world after watching Dogville, after listening to \"Dog Eat Dog\" by Joni Mitchell.  The artists who see it clearly, say it clearly, yes, they help us love the world, anyway.The next poem, poem IX, is a series of unpunctuated, uncapitalized questions, ending with \"does God have a stone / for an eye\" and giving the book its title.  This book took me from my petty concerns and deposited me in a river bed, to learn something new and to learn again something old, from a stone.Teach me permanence--how you don't moveunless moved, and when you landyou land forever.In poem XVIII the stone is compared to a shell you hold to your ear to hear ocean.But a stone makesno sound.  Hold itall day to your headand you'll begin to knowa humming.  The stoneis lost in meditation.It's a bit like youwhen you're sleeping--wholly reliant uponthe world's swirling mercy.Oh, I love that \"swirling mercy.\" And then you wake up.  Wake up. And pay attention."},

I was also pleased to learn that Mary Oliver and Sharon Olds are in demand, so much so that I had to send people off to the new book stores and hope they are stocking plenty of O poets.So here's a coincidence of the sort I love. I finished The Death of Adam this year...deep, informative essays on history and theology, among other things, by Marilynne Robinson, who seeks to restore the reputation of John Calvin (Jean Cauvin) and also to give Marguerite de Navarre her due (as women of the past were so often overlooked, and are still neglected), and what to my wondering eyes should appear in my hands yesterday at work but a book of Original Letters Relative to the English Reformation, published in 1846 for the Parker Society, which is dedicated to such things.I could not resist pausing in my examination and description of this book to read three of the letters to John Calvin, all three written in tones of great respect and acknowledging his kindness and generosity.  I am amazed by the world, over and over again.And just in case you want to stand under the mistletoe with someone, here's this."},

{"title": "Cyborgs, Part 2", "date": "Tuesday, December 21, 2010", "text": "Day 316 of the \"What are you reading, and why?\" project, and here is Part 2 of the interview with Susan Slaviero about Cyborgia, her amazing book of poems that is also a kind of science fiction, from Mayapple Press.Me: How did Cyborgia come together?  Did you plan it as a set of poems exploring these issues?  Or did you find yourself writing the poems and then group them accordingly?Susan Slaviero: Originally, I was hoping to have a small set of poems about female cyborgs that might be enough for a chapbook.  As I began writing the poems, I found I wanted to explore these ideas further.  While I did not plan out the individual sections ahead of time, I did have a rough idea of some of the divisions—such as the reinvention of fairy tale characters as cyborgs and the depiction of cyborgs in film—and the sections evolved during the writing process although the poems themselves were conceived of as a body of work intended to fit together as a kind of exploration of a specific image/idea. Tell me about the use of these punctuation marks in your poems: ( ), [ ], and < >.  And more!?Some of the punctuation is intended to imitate the look of code, such as the angle brackets you might see in html tags.  They also suggest mathematical equations, as well as simply create a certain visual ‘look’ for the poems as they inhabit the page.  Just as the bodies of cyborg women are sectioned off, broken, and disassembled, so is the language in the poems.  I think the brackets and parenthesis reinforce the themes of assembly and disassembly, of there being an orderly process to creation (that sometimes goes awry!)I would like to quote a short poem in full, to give people a taste of the book.  May I quote “Briar Rose, in Cryostasis”?  (And would you like to comment on it?  Suggest another poem as well, and/or instead?) [Susan gave permission for \"Briar Rose,\" from the Boolean Fairy Tales section of the book, and also suggested \"Manifesto for Ghosts,\" from the Ontology of the Virtual Body section, and the very last poem in Cyborgia.  So here are both!]:Briar Rose, in Cryostasis  Sometimes, the evil fairy wears a lab coat.She pricks your finger with an infected needle,suspends your head in a thermos flask.You might be trapped in a liquid nitrogenenchantment for a hundred years, surroundedby cracked class and jagged ice crystals,waiting for the prince to defrost you,to kiss the stump of your pretty neck.Manifesto for GhostsWhat connects is the mechanoid process, a feel for mathematica and puppetry.            Bio(r)evolution is a vicious spider.            We sicken & weave in our cocoons.Mutant.

{"title": "I Promised You Cyborgs", "date": "Monday, December 20, 2010", "text": "Day 315 of the \"What are you reading, and why?\" project, and a while back I promised you cyborgs, and today, here they are!  A reminder of the why:  I met poet Susan Slaviero when we were both scheduled as readers at Brothers K in Evanston, Illinois in the RHINO Reads series, and shortly thereafter her book Cyborgia came out from Mayapple Press.  I read it and found it fascinating, and asked her a bunch of questions about it.  Here are some of her answers. Me:  The book Cyborgia seems like a marvelous mix of feminism +  science fiction +  mythology +  language poetry.  Is it?  If so, why?  What prompted you to do this?Susan Slaviero: Yes.  I would say that’s a pretty accurate description.  I think we all have our obsessions, and my obsessions tend to appear as recurring threads in the things I write.  I’ve always had a fascination with gender-as-performance, and feminist theory in general.  As a final project for the Women’s Studies program in college, I completed a research project on cyberfeminist theory. I looked not only at the dominant theorists (such as Donna Haraway and Sherry Turkle) but also at poetry, fiction, hypertext and the ways in which technology influences our ideas about gender, work and sexuality in popular culture. Cyborgia is, in many ways, my attempt at explicating these ideas through verse.   Do you read a lot of science?  Non-fiction, I mean, and maybe medicine? I enjoy reading pretty much everything.  I do like non-fiction, especially books about psychology—which is more of a ‘soft science’ I suppose.  I read a good deal more fiction and poetry than non-fiction these days.  Do you read/watch a lot of science fiction?  Favorite authors/films?I would say I have always loved science fiction!  Some of my favorite authors include Margaret Atwood, Ray Bradbury, Mary Doria Russell*, Marge Piercy, Philip K Dick, Neil Stephenson, and William Gibson, to name a few.  I’m actually a big fan of science fiction television shows, too. I love the recent Battlestar Galactica series that appeared on the scifi channel—I think it’s one of the best things I’ve ever seen on television!—I also admire a number of other science fiction series like Firefly, LOST, and the X-files.  *[I'm pretty sure I introduced Susan to Mary Doria Russell in this blog!]  Re: above non-fiction reading/knowledge in science, algebra, computer science, George Boole.  I love the Boolean Fairy Tales section of the book.  I’ve done Boolean searches, and understand Boolean logic to be combinations of variables using: and, or, not, if, then, except.  Is this how you composed or conceived of some of the poems in Cyborgia?I do love the idea of variables, of combinations and permutations…I think this is most evident in the third section of the book—Boolean Fairy Tales.  Still, I think it appears throughout the work, particularly as the gendered cyborg bodies are imagined, assembled, and disassembled. I looked up the Red Queen Hypothesis, title of the first section of Cyborgia, assuming it related to the book’s Lewis Carroll epigraph, “Now here, you see, it takes all the running you can do to keep in the same place,” and it does!  That is the “red queen hypothesis” in evolution—that sexual reproduction, though prevalent, is sort of inefficient, leaving us “running…in place,” so to speak, partly because it works better in adapting the individual than the species for life on earth.  Is that a fair summary of the theory?  And is that indeed a context for the poems in this section and the book as a whole?  The first section of the book is especially tied to this theory.  I’m thrilled that you looked it up!  I think the evolution of reproduction—which has changed dramatically as technology becomes more advanced—is an important aspect of the book’s opening segment.  In many of these poems, reproduction is asexual, mechanical, violent.  There’s a certain inefficiency to these processes as well. Admittedly, I’m playing with the theory a bit!  I think as we make (human) reproduction a more technological process, we are not so much moving forward as “running in place.”Specifically, the Red Queen Hypothesis has the “evolutionary arms race” in it—the species fighting each other for life—and I notice how many of the cyborgs have actual “arms” or weapons built into their mechanical arms** or bodies***. **Example: In “Gretel Discusses Her Prosthetic Arm,” Gretel’s new “mechanical limb” has fabulously efficient kitchen tools built in and actual weapons: “my ulna is a loaded gun, …the bend in my elbow bears teeth.”***Example: In “A Cybernetic Mermaid Dreams of the Sea,” the speaker asks, “Would you have me hardwired with finger-guns, / tridents for arms, a death ray behind my uvula?”Tell me more about this, in terms of individuals (and their relationships) and in terms of “survival of the species” in Cyborgia.These cyborg women were designed as weapons, and intended to fall under the control of someone else (i.e. the designer or ‘creator’).  In both “Gretel” and “A Cybernetic Mermaid” this backfires upon their creators, as they are sentient beings, capable of autonomy and therefore unpredictable.  It’s a chilling thought, to imagine something we’ve made to suit our own purposes might evolve and become something “other than what (we) intended.”   I love how “Cybernetic Mermaid” progresses in self-consciousness and perhaps changes and the course of events under man’s seeming control:...I have become something differentthan what you intended.  More than webbing and talons, or a nuclearfishtail. I am fragments of your carefully drawn schematics:aquatic chimera           water-larynx                endsong.Are you saying that she can sing her own end to the world, or change the ending, turn it away from the inevitable, possibly nuclear, “endsong”?I think that’s a fairly astute interpretation.  She is, after all, an autonomous ‘weapon’ and that’s a very dangerous thing.   [More from Susan Slaviero tomorrow!]"},

We have several of his books, too, our family, personally, and also Babbitt's Books, and they have his distinctive little faint pencil Xs and curlicues in the margins, at sentences and phrases he loved and would write out or type out later on sheets of paper, the wisdom of the world digested.  The \"film version\" of Grif's notes would be the various post-its on the CD covers with dates and directors and stars and the occasional tidbit of information.In the case of A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, he wrote that it was directed by Elia Kazan, \"his first film.\"  And a fine one it is, too, with James Dunn, who played Francie Nolan's singing father, winning an Academy Award that year (1945) for Best Supporting Actor.  Lloyd Nolan is in this film, too, and Dorothy McGuire, Joan Blondell, and Peggy Ann Garner, as Francie.  My mom was known as Peggy Lou as a child, so it must have been fun for a Peggy Ann to play one of her favorite book characters in the movie.I was struck by the depiction of childbirth--none of that screaming and cursing we see now in sitcoms and comedies.  Just the quiet, patient pain and fatigue of the woman in a long labor, conserving her strength to get through, and finally letting her daughter see her emotional vulnerability because the stress has taken away her defenses.Makes me want to read the book again!  We don't have it at Babbitt's, but we do have Joy in the Morning.  (A film was made of that book, too, starring Richard Chamberlain and Yvette Mimieux, and click here for an odd tidbit about its premier...!)"},

The Amazon blurbed reviews and reader reviews echo Ashley's \"uplifting\" comment. I liked the explanation, from Bookmarks Magazine, of the title of the book as a Baltistan proverb: \"The first time you share tea with a Balti, you are a stranger,\" a villager tells Greg Mortenson. \"The second time, you are an honored guest. The third time you become family.\"This morning I needed three cups of coffee, after a little collage party--bookmark collages with images and words.  I stuck with my Emily Dickinson lines, and Sarah and Julie brought glue sticks and images and candy canes and wine and their wonderful minds.

{"title": "Generosity", "date": "Friday, December 17, 2010", "text": "Day 312 of the \"What are you reading, and why?\" project, and Dick and the SOBs (a men's book group) just read and discussed Generosity: An Enhancement, by Richard Powers, because they have liked his work in the past.  Previously they read Galatea 2.2 and Three Farmers on the Way to a Dance.Generosity is a book about discovering the \"happiness gene\" and the various risks and dangers (some of them emotional, and involving innocence) of that--of the knowing, of science getting involved in happiness, etc.Galatea 2.2 also engages science, this time in the effort to understand the nature of intelligence, re-seeing the Pygmalion/Galatea myth, where a sculptor falls in love with his statue, in a sort of man-falls-in-love-with-a-computer kind of way. The man, like the author, is named Richard Powers, so this may be a self-reflexive postmodern kind of thing.  There are various other associations with the name and myth/s of Galatea, and I haven't yet read the book, so I won't make any assumptions here. Powers is known as a very \"cerebral\" author, so I'm sure he has incorporated whatever ideas and allusions actually pertain. But I do love that her name, in Ovid's myth (of Acis and Galatea) means \"she who is milk white,\" so here is a milk-white version of her, though from the Pygmalion myth, in which the statue came to life, and they married and had a child.Three Farmers on the Way to a Dance is about the intersecting stories of people seeking information about a photograph from World War I. Its title sounds so homey and simple, but this appears to be one of those \"cerebral\" discursive novels that defies traditional linear storytelling. As Library Journal puts it, \"Because of its complex plot, this first novel will appeal mainly to sophisticated readers.\" Still, the SOBs liked it. So I might like it, too. Not that we're not sophisticated and cerebral, er, but....anyhoo...!Dick was reading Generosity on his iPhone and started highlighting phrases. He liked how the phrases that stood out to him (mentally, and as electronically highlighted) looked and sounded like they could be lyrics in Bob Dylan songs. Oh, my, I do love what people notice when they are reading!'Tis the season for many appeals to our generosity. May you find your own happy ways to give what you can to anyone in need."},

{"title": "No Frigate Like a Book", "date": "Wednesday, December 15, 2010", "text": "Day 310 of the \"What are you reading, and why?\" project, and I return today to The Death of Adam, by Marilynne Robinson, because I finally finished this amazing book of essays by a wonderful historian and novelist, and because of the marvelous mention of Emily Dickinson on page 211. This comes in the essay titled \"Marguerite of Navarre, Part II, \" which is really mostly about Marguerite, while the essay \"Marguerite of Navarre\" (understood to be part I) was mostly about Jean Cauvin, whom she sheltered and nurtured.In addition to revealing Robinson as an excellent historian and compassionate moralist, this book reveals her as a feminist and environmentalist. I remember that when I started this book, I kept wondering why The Barbaric Heart, by Curtis White, wasn't full of references and citations to Marilynne Robinson. Her book was first published in 1998, and his in 2009, a full decade later. I still don't know why! Her last essay \"Wilderness\" heralds a book like his: \"I think we are desperately in need of a new, chastened, self-distrusting* vision of the world, an austere vision that can postpone the outdoor pleasures of cherishing exotica, and the first-world pleasures of assuming we exist to teach reasonableness to the less fortunate, and the debilitating pleasures of imagining that our own impulses are reliably good.\" She points out that our own impulses quite often foist nuclear waste onto the wildernesses of Utah, Idaho, and the Lake District in England, so beloved of the Romantic poets. In fact, she has a whole book, Mother Country, about environmental pollution in Britain, evidently so ignored or so unpopular as to be out of print....People want pictures of koalas. They want to \"Save the Whales\" on bumper stickers. They don't want the cold hard truth.\"I am bold enough to suggest [that], to this point, environmental successes quite exactly resemble failure. What have we done for the whale, if we lose the sea?  If we lose the sea, how do we mend the atmosphere?\" And so on.*And Curtis White, in The Barbaric Heart, criticizes the environmental movement itself for falling short of the real change, which must come in the heart.\"Every environmental problem is a human problem,\" says Robinson. \"Civilization is the ecology being lost. We can do nothing that matters if we cannot encourage its rehabilitation.\" She wants us to civilize ourselves enough not to keep up with the current money-based industrial and military practices that require the relentless dumping of dangerous garbage into our seas and wildernesses, even to \"surrender the idea of wilderness,\" especially of wilderness \"as an escape from civilization,\" and instead become civilized enough not to destroy it and each other.But what about Marguerite and Emily?! Marguerite gathered scholars and writers together and promoted French as a literary language and advanced civilization in the time she lived, and herself wrote poems and stories that today read as modern but were neglected in her own time and \"read as lady's poetry and therefore as all she asked of herself, or the best she could do. Emily Dickinson comes to mind.\" And the dismissing of her innovations in language and punctuation.\"There is no frigate like a book,\" wrote Emily Dickinson. When I first heard that phrase, I did not know a frigate was a sailing vessel, often light and swift, that could carry me away to far-off places, like a book, and sometimes a war vessel, that could \"arm\" me with knowledge. But I had heard the phrase \"frig it,\" one \"f\" word substituting for another in a frustrated curse, so I thought I was hearing something I shouldn't have heard when someone, my dad, I think, first quoted that line in my hearing.But I have sailed backward into history, and forward into the inevitable deterioration of the environment if we do not veer off our present course, via The Death of Adam, by Marilynne Robinson. And still I look around at our present world, as she does, with childlike wonder and hope and ripples and waves of compassion."},

I am a sucker for humor and one of them is even titled You Suck. Yes, it's about vampires.  I resisted the temptation to buy this for my niece, a vampire connoisseur.  I thought it might be too risqué, but she is familiar with risqué vampires, too, so it might have been OK. I did not resist the temptation last Christmas to give my parents a humor book: In a Word--words by Margaret Ernst, and drawings by James Thurber--because it was too perfect.  She is a retired English teacher who loves words, and James Thurber is one of my dad's favorite humorists.  They have Columbus, Ohio in common, among other things.  Thurber, in fact, is one of the funny guys in Humorists, along with Laurel and Hardy, the Marx Brothers, G. K. Chesterton, and....Nancy Mitford?And I did not resist a skinny funny book on the history of toilets for some lucky kid in my acquaintance (who does not read this blog).What helps me resist temptation is a basic lack of cash.  Hence, today's bookmark reminder, and the fact that some of my gifts this year are indeed Emily Dickinson collage bookmarks.This one is made with a giant 500 bill folded over a piece of cardboard, with butterflies on front and back.  My son scanned both sides and then put the images together to recreate the whole bill and make the butterfly wings touch!  Isn't that cool?The Emily Dickinson lines are these: \"Each life converges to some centre.\"  The cut up phrases that make this line do converge on the center, McKinley's head.  \"A narrow fellow in the grass\" hides along the narrow margin.  (My son loves how the color of the money matches the color of the printed poetry page.)Above the butterfly on the other side: \"I measure every grief I meet.\"  And below: \"Heaven is what I cannot reach!\" At the utter bottom: \"It dropped so low in my regard.\"I find that rather funny."},

The stack included The Fantasticks, by Tom Jones and Harvey Schmidt, based on Les Romanesques, by Edmond Rostand, also famous for Cyrano de Bergerac; Mame, by Jerome Lawrence and Robert Edwin Lee, with music by Jerry Herman, based on the play Auntie Mame, by Patrick Dennis; Applause, by Betty Comden and Adolph Green, lyrics by Lee Adams, music by Charles Strouse, and based on the movie All About Eve (which I had completely forgotten!); and The Sound of Music, the famous Rodgers and Hammerstein musical with a book by Howard Lindsay and Russel Crouse, and based on the actual Trapp Family Singers and the memoir by Maria von Trapp.And, also braving the weather, three of us met for the Sunday afternoon poetry workshop. We met not in the rare book room, our usual haunt, but across the street at the Coffeehouse, so we could have hot liquids.  Alas, any time the back door opened, we got hit by the cold draft.Poetry is the occasion for today's images, two of my collage bookmarks, with first lines by Emily Dickinson: \"We play at paste,\" \"Victory comes late,\" \"The nearest dream recedes, unrealized,\" and \"We outgrow love like other things.\" I did not take pictures of the ones I gave to by book group, but my son, home now from college, scanned these for me and gave them pale gray backgrounds, and saved them as images I can use in my blog!!Yay for technologically savvy children!  Who help their mommies."},
{"title": "Figments of Our Imagination", "date": "Saturday, December 11, 2010", "text": "Day 306 of the \"What are you reading, and why?\" project, and today I return to The Death of Adam, by Marilynne Robinson, because this is a book of essays I have been reading slowly and carefully, as required by the author's content and style. She has depth and breadth of knowledge as a historian, and specificity in providing evidence for any claim and in building a subtle argument, and a clarity of style and slow flow that help it all come through. If you have read her novels Housekeeping and Gilead, you know that you need to read them slowly and pay close attention. There is such beauty! There is such wonder! (I am going to read Home, the follow-up novel to Gilead, next, if circumstances allow.)But today I offer Robinson in a compare/contrast mode to Figment, an exciting new writing website for literary teens, that might interest Donna and Nancy (and other blogger teachers). You can read about its founding in the New York Times, here, and visit some of its offerings here. I think this might be very fruitful (heh heh, see apples above) in a classroom, to spice things up and encourage reading and writing, as well as outside it, for teens who already love reading and writing. And part of me cringes, as it might just encourage more of the \"all about me\" mode of personal and expressive writing and sharing that I see out there in the web-based world of writing and blogging, and in the truncated print-based world of education. It was a thrill to read that teens were not interested in just more \"social networking\" at a website like this, but I've got to hope that there is sustained actual reading going on somewhere, whether on screen or in print, that strengthens the muscles of attention and clear thinking.I see a lot of clicking going on these days, the search for images, and the insistence on minimal text. And now, back to Robinson, who is discussing the guy we in America call John Calvin and tend to disparage as a super-prim religious prude, but who, according to her sustained scholarship, was not like that at all!! His real name, in France, was Jean Cauvin, which Robinson uses to distinguish him from his reputation. On the topic of images and idols, Robinson says, \"Cauvin rejected the 'old saw that images are the books of the uneducated' remarking, 'I confess, as the matter stands, that today there are not a few who are unable to do without such \"books\"...those in authority in the church turned over to idols the office of teaching for no other reason than that they themselves were mute.'\" OK, it's true that he is saying the educated are the ones depending on images, not words, here, a sort of insult, on the one hand, but, on the other, he is saying that those unable to read (unable to be educated in their times) have a right to the images if no one will take the time to teach them in words.... And, hey, some of us are visual learners! Cauvin wouldn't use that term but was certainly smart enough to imagine that concept, that real possibility.Robinson doesn't pretend that Cauvin was some kind of angel, or model human. She discusses his shameful association with the death by execution of Michael Servetus for religious heresy, an event wrapped in various ironies as 1) Cauvin opposed Servetus's views, but authorities used Servetus's trial as a weapon against Cauvin! 2) Cauvin was all about religious reform and religious freedom and was himself hounded out of various places for his views, including Geneva, where this trial took place, which had banished Cauvin and then brought him back, and 3) Cauvin's refutations of Servetus prove his great respect for God's covenants with various peoples, including the Jewish people, even though he is now associated, by wrongful reputation, with a particularly stringent and unforgiving Puritanical version of Christianity. Sigh... But (still with me? as this is rather a lot of text), Robinson notes that slow burning and other horrific tortures and styles of execution were common, not made up by Jean Cauvin. The Wikipedia article I've linked here even clarifies that Cauvin suggested beheading (a quicker death) rather than slow burning for Servetus, but the angry town burned him at the stake \"atop a pyre of his own books.\" This is what people did back then. We have hanging and electric chairs, and death by injection. Until we get rid of capital punishment altogether, we are stuck with whatever versions of barbarity we choose. And whatever mistaken executions.And now to Robinson's conclusion of that particular essay in the book. She has noted all along that we take the easy digested version of history, however wrong it might be, instead of reading closely and carefully all of what's actually there, and making real choices based on real scholarship. \"Yet, lacking curiosity and the habit of study and any general grasp of history, we have entered a period of nostalgia and reaction. We want the past back, though we have no idea what it was.\" And this is a definition of nostalgia--a longing for a sense of well-being in the past that might never have really existed.A figment of our imagination.\"Our ignorant parody of history,\" Robinson goes on, \"affirms our ignorant parody of religious or 'traditional' values.\" This is important, because despite the beheadings and burnings at the stake, it turns out that the real Jean Cauvin was rather more tolerant than some of today's fundamentalist Christians. \"This matters, because history is precedent and permission, and in this important instance, as in many others, we have lost plain accuracy, not to speak of complexity, substance, and human inflection. We want to return to the past, and we have made our past a demonology and not a human narrative.\" We have made our present such a thing, too. Look at all the demonizing that goes on in the news.Demons are figments of our dark imaginations.And this particular Adam and Eve is a projection of Albrecht Durer's imagination."},
{"title": "Echoing Emily", "date": "Friday, December 10, 2010", "text": "Day 305 of the \"What are you reading, and why? project, and today is Emily Dickinson's birthday and also Human Rights Day, so Sarah and I, and Babbitt's Books, are celebrating this in the store blog by offering up our books by or about Eleanor Roosevelt, who led an international committee in drafting the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and Emily Dickinson, who wrote a jillion poems and sewed them up in little packets and stored them in a chest in her closet.I celebrated in advance by making some collage bookmarks, each with the first line of an Emily Dickinson poem glued somewhere into the collage.Dave is celebrating in his blog today (Via Negativa in the blogroll) by airing some podcasts of various people reading poems by Emily Dickinson.  If I can master my technology challenge, or get someone to help me, I will send along a recording, too!  Here, by the way, is his Woodrat Podcast for Thanksgiving, as I am thankful for Human Rights Day!  (Which I will celebrate by writing some letters for Amnesty International.)I suggested to Dave that he contact Kelli Russell Agodon, who wrote the book Letters from the Emily Dickinson Room, for a recording, and I am further celebrating by returning to my reading of that book.  (I read around in it when it first arrived so I wouldn't just race through, and then last night I gorged on it.  I must have been really hungry for poetry after reading Loving Frank.  I promise I will re-read more slowly and carefully, and chew each bite 35 times, Amanda Wingfield...and Helen Stevenson.  OK, enough of that.)  Anyhoo....I am delighted that the Emily Dickinson Room is a real place not just in Amherst, at Emily's family home, called the Homestead, but in Oregon, in the Sylvia Beach Hotel!Kelli's poems are also delightful--clever, wise, funny, and oh, my God, the anagram poems are amazing!  Here is a snippet from \"Xanax Prescription Goes Unfulfilled.\"Let me trust my emotions          because even in my nuttiest rooms,I find safety in words.  I satisfy wonder,to alphabetize is to baptize and heal.And then, utterly resisting \"Dr. Xanax,\" she insists:Let me get through thiswithout you.Let meecho poemsas with thatas with thatcomes hope.These poems treat the huge subjects of poetry--God, love, death--as did Emily's, and echo and allude to other great artists.  She explores the letter form, as the book's title promises, in such poems as \"Letter to Vincent Van Gogh, Who Loved Silence\" and \"Letter to Walt Whitman, Who Painted Butterflies.\"  And, as I love coincidence, I just have to mention that some of my bookmark collages included cardboard butterflies, which feature in Kelli's Whitman poem, that starts off with this newsy epigraph:  In 1942, Whitman's handmade cardboard butterfly disappeared from the Library of Congress.  It was found in a New York attic in 1995.Of course, Emily Dickinson loved butterflies, too!And, of course, my cardboard butterflies came from a Kleenex box."},
{"title": "Frankly Loving", "date": "Thursday, December 9, 2010", "text": "Day 304 of the \"What are you reading, and why?\" project, and, as I told you a while back, my book group was reading Loving Frank, by Nancy Horan. It's about Frank Lloyd Wright's love affair with Mamah Borthwick, from her point of view (in a third person telling). We met last night to discuss it.And here's a dilemma. Kim had trouble discussing it as fiction because it is based on real incidents. That is, it is historical fiction, but not just a story set in historical times, but one where the outcome is necessarily pre-determined by what really happened. There's no fiddling with this \"plot,\" nor making the events that lead up to the ending actually make fictive sense. So there's not a good interpretive question related to the arc of the story or the characters' motives, and there is the dangerous tendency to ask, \"Did she deserve her tragic ending?\"Using the word \"tragic\" in its commonplace sense of \"a really, really bad thing happened\" rather than its classic sense of a fatal flaw bringing the character to his (usually his, as the classic definition is from Aristotle, based on the ancient Greek tragedies) inevitable fate. Frank Lloyd Wright has enough hubris, in history and in this novel, to be a classically tragic character, but it's not about him; it's about her. So did she invite her fate? Did she deserve her fate? Is \"fate\" even a function of this novel?So I came round to the question, \"Why did the author want to tell us Mamah's story, from the inside?\" Did she want us to judge Mamah, as American society did in the time she was living? Did she want us to understand her better? And find a way, frankly, to love and forgive her, rather than judge her? Is it a cautionary tale for readers (especially women) living now, specifically warning women not to get caught up in the man's goals and needs, but, if you want a frank and true love match, be whole yourself?We had a lively discussion of the book and also those reverberations in life--looking at how double standards still pertain, how the layering of generations still sends a lot of mixed messages to women, and how important it is, indeed, to find one's proper mate, if mating, or lifelong companionship of some sort, are in this mix.Susan pointed out that \"your soul mate isn't always the best life mate.\" Of course, she has a great life mate in her husband, Bob, and a great soul mate in her dog, Kayla.Book group gals, you might want to click here to see more pictures of Mamah, copies of some of the actual newspaper articles, and even the covers of the Ellen Key books she was reading and translating!"},

Dad said it was a deep story and they had a great discussion.So I read the story tonight, and it is pretty amazing.  Then I did a little research and learned that Kipling, whose own son was off in the Great War, wrote the story to try to keep the worst from happening, by imagining it. I've heard of other writers doing that, too. A kind of magical thinking.It didn't work for Kipling, though. According to the Sampler, Kipling's 18-year-old son died in the Battle of Loos shortly after the story was first published in the September 1915 issue of the Century magazine.Having read that little introduction, I read the story with rising grief, fear, horror, and, yes, anger.  It is a horrifying story. Kipling was angered by the war, by the Germans, in particular, saying in June of 1915, \"However the world pretends to divide itself, there are only two divisions in the world today--human being and Germans.\"  It's astonishing.  And that was the first World War. Repercussions of that world war led to the next, and think how the demonizing continued.King of Kings.  And Lord of Lords. Just pausing to hear hallelujahs.  And ironies.Today I noticed books by Kipling at Babbitt's--Kim and Just-So Stories. For a long time we didn't have any Kipling, much to the dismay of graduate students in Children's Literature classes. Perhaps that's why we have those fine nearly-new paperback copies; students had to buy them new...and brought them to us afterwards.  Sigh.... But at least they got trade or cash on whatever they brought in!And my dad recently read The Man Who Would be King.To hear Jeff Buckley sing \"Hallelujah,\" by Leonard Cohen, get Grace.

Oddly, when I went to Amazon to check this out, I actually viewed page 206, and there we were! Frank in a scene from The Golden Key and me in The Robber Bridegroom, part of the same Story Theatre production. The pictures show how stage lighting helps the actor create the setting, and projections throw fragile pictorial shadows on and behind us. Sweet memory.Now I will have to see if we have a copy of this, secondhand, in Theatre History at Babbitt's.I was reading some of the online literary journals, including The Furnace Review, and found a wonderful poem by Tara Deal, called \"The End of an Editor in a Secondhand Bookshop.\" I think you can click on it right here, but if not, just click her name to get to the poem. Then click around some more. What a beautiful journal.And, because I am all about print, here is her website (wait! that's not print!), which shows you three of her books in print.

Sutherland, the local editor and publisher) and Reynard is a local judge.  His poems, not surprisingly, contain justice and compassion in equal measure.And, probably not quite by coincidence, as producer Bruce Bergethon pays attention to these things, a poem from the book, \"Juvenile Day,\" aired on WGLT Poetry Radio today.  Yes, I had a \"driveway moment,\" or rather a parking place moment, behind Babbitt's Books, on my way to work this morning.  \"Juvenile Day\" is about juvenile court, and I've always liked this one for its handling, legally, and here, poetically, of \"fault\" and \"responsibility.\"To quote a few stanzas:Wherefore, I find it is not your fault,Danny, that you have Post-TraumaticStress Disorder, Oppositional DefiantDisorder, and R-O Bi-Polar illness.Or that you are under the influenceof Depakote 500 mg, Zoloft 200 mg,and Seroquel 40 mg.  But it isyour responsibility not to swallowshampoo or thumbtacks, not to runaway, steal gas, shoplift matchesfrom Dollar General, and not to knifeyour neighbor or your nurse duringthe manic phase of your moon....That's it, isn't it?  Some things are not our fault, but some things are still our responsibility.  A good judge knows the difference.In Charley's chapbook, Heart Break is a small town in \"a pear-shaped state, the name of which is regularly mispronounced by its own citizens.\"  But it is also a place to live in compassion and in tolerance, a place to learn acceptance, or a place to make important changes or die.  Some people die in Heart Break.  Some live and learn.  Some move, or are moved.  And that's the utility of heartbreak.Image = album cover, Kanye West; if you want to preview \"Welcome to Heartbreak,\" click Amazon here."},

Yes, Bond.  James Bond.\"Ben.  Born Ben.\" Ben did not actually say that.  What he actually said, in response to my question, \"Are you doing some kind of reading project?\" was, \"My life.\"  And I completely understood!Ben was at that point, after quietly moving through the aisles of Babbitt's Books, making a fine stack of books on a convenient computer stand.  He had hung his coat on the back a chair, and every now and then he asked a question. One was about Graham Greene.  Our Man in Havana, I said.  He said, The End of the Affair. But we didn't have either of these. Or, evidently, The Quiet American.  So Ben's stack includes others, instead.Here is Ben's stack of books:Graham Greene:*  The Power and the Glory, The Heart of the Matter, A Burnt-Out Case Arthur Rimbaud: A Season in Hell and The Drunken Boat (in one volume, paperback)Richard Adams: Watership Down (which Ben read as a child, but needed now to own again)Ken Kesey: One Flew Over the Cuckoo's NestSinclair Lewis: Main StreetNeal Cassady: The First Third Ben said it was time to read a book by Neal Cassady, as Neal had been the hero of about 4 books he'd read. Ben's favorite writer is Jack Kerouac, and he made a Kerouac pilgrimage to San Francisco and found Kerouac's house on North Beach, a A-frame that \"didn't fit,\" so it must have been his.He read Catcher in the Rye at about age 12, and also The World According to Garp, by John Irving, at the urging of his mother.  My parents recommended Garp to me, too! And I recommended Franny and Zooey to Ben! And also White Teeth by Zadie Smith, which he bought, because we had a nice hardback for $4!I didn't mean to put Ben on the spot by asking if he'd read any women. I was responding to his comment that he liked mainly the older stuff and the only contemporary writer he really liked was David Foster Wallace.* I recommended Zadie Smith as a contemporary writer who puts people together of different cultures and generations, the way Flannery O'Connor would stick people of different beliefs and attitudes into a paper bag and shake them up to see what would happen. Ben liked that, and also Salman Rushdie's blurb on the back.*Wikipedia tells me Graham Greene had bipolar disorder. Ah. Erm, David Foster Wallace.Ben is writing a novel himself!  And that's all I'm going to say about it.Ben remembered that the first book he ever bought at Babbitt's, at the old location, was Kurt Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse Five, when he was 15. It hooked him, on Vonnegut, and on Babbitt's, and on used bookstores in general, because new bookstores, he says, have plenty of cookbooks and mysteries, but not this great stuff.\"Why Rimbaud?\" I asked. Because Kerouac mentioned him. Lots of Ben's reading is of the one-book-leads-to-another sort, and, if you read my blog, you know the same thing happens to me. Why Main Street? Because we didn't have Babbitt, mentioned in the Nobel Prize citation, or Arrowsmith, which won the Pulitzer Prize. Ben asked us if Babbitt's Books is named for Babbitt. Yes, it was once a favorite book of the owner.  And there is a giant flat-Brian picture of the owner in the window holding Babbitt, one of those wonderful library Read posters. Sometimes it scares the baristas at the Coffeehouse across the street, because it looks like he is watching them. Telling them to read this book....And I asked Ben if he knew the Pulitzer bloggers.

My son loved the movie of Little Women, the 1994 version, with Susan Sarandon, Winona Ryder, Claire Danes, and Kirsten Dunst.  As he would have been four then, he saw it a year or so later when it appeared on cable television at his grandparents' house, probably at Christmastime. Maybe a year or so after that, confident of his reading ability, I gave him the book for Christmas...but the moment had passed. Actually, he was still in the Batman, Xena: Warrior Princess mode when he fell in love with Little Women, and that moment had passed, too.I read several of the Oz books as a child, and Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass, by Lewis Carroll, but my daughter didn't. She had her own tastes--children's historical fiction for a while--and grew up in a film and computer culture. Today in the store, a young woman was talking about reading the Wicked books, by Gregory Maguire (OMG, I am linking you to his \"Shopping-Enabled Wikipedia Page on Amazon.com,\" a thing I just discovered in this moment, showing that 1) I am clueless, and 2) we live in a shopping culture, but 3) I don't) and I realized, while referring to the original Oz books, by L. Frank Baum, that she had no idea what I was talking about.Which leads me to the Mad Hatters' Review, the \"demented\" brain child of Carol Novack (a goddess in yesterday's blog entry, a mad hatter in today's), an online multi-media magazine subtitled Edgy and Enlightened Literature, Art and Music in the Age of Dementia, and \"staffed solely by mad hatters\" (so the plural possessive is indeed correct)! And if that's not enough, here is her blog, where you can find out how to get hold of Giraffes in Hiding, which yesterday's Marcus Speh will be reviewing. Here is his blog, Nothing to Flawnt.According to Novack, mad hatters were \"mad\" because their working conditions exposed them to mercury poisoning. Me? I'm just a little crazy. And a lot grown up. But a child at heart.Today a young man walked out of the store with vintage grown-up short stories, by John Cheever, William Maxwell, etc., in a New Yorker anthology. He was Christmas shopping but hadn't spotted the perfect book yet, so he was getting this for himself.But he was sure tickled when I told him about Sarah's 30 Days of Christmas project with the new Babbitt's Books blog, so I am telling you, too! Pictures and descriptions of fabulous gifts!  (And it's working, as I see cross-outs, meaning some of those books already sold!)  (Wait, maybe I am part of the shopping culture.)"},

Annette Binder, and \"Housewifely Arts,\" by Megan Mayhew Bergman. I love the idea of this tiny print journal--one story per issue, saddle stapled, chapbook style.  At the One Story website, you can discuss the stories, subscribe, get lots of additional information, and learn how to submit.  But it's a sweet little print magazine that comes in the mail, like Inch (for short poems and short short fiction) and blink, before it.Marcus, a new Facebook friend and fellow writer, who lives in Germany, has an interesting stack of books on his desk right now:The Ballad of the Sad Cafe, by Carson McCullersSamuel Beckett, The Short ProseOur Lady of the Flowers, by Jean GenetGiraffes in Hiding, by Carol Novackand three by John Hawkes: The Lime Twig, Second Skin, and TravestyI would love to know from Marcus, why these particular books at this particular time?  Which will he read first? Will he read one straight through and then the next, or read around in several at a time?!Looks like John Hawkes has great admirers and writes lyrically in mystery or thriller mode and also in complex prose resembling a European more than an American sensibility.  Is this correct, Hawkes readers?Giraffes in Hiding looks like a wild ride!  And its subtitle is The Mythical Memoirs of Carol Novack, so she must be a goddess!  I love this bit of the author's bio at Amazon:  \"Carol Novack is a writer of sociopolitical neuroerotic rants and raves, poems, prose poems, and image drenched, lyrical whatnots, and a play.\"  Ah, Genet and Beckett wrote plays, too.Marcus, do you read a lot of plays?I am progressing in Other Voices, Other Rooms, by Truman Capote, and found the phrase that is the title on page 100, in the indirect dialogue of the character Little Sunshine, who lives in an old hotel because if he ever \"went away, as he had once upon a time, other voices, other rooms, voices lost and clouded, strummed his dreams.\"  And that is a taste of the lovely, lyrical, vaguely mysterious prose style of this particular novel.I took up this novel to encounter the Idabel Thompkins, who is based on Harper Lee, as I learned in Mockingbird, by Charles J. Shields.  I mentioned this in an earlier blog entry, spelling it Tompkins, as I'd found it on page 59 of that book.  Imagine my surprise to find it spelled Thompkins in the actual novel.  This is one of those moments of mild woe for me, when I ponder the state of print publishing, proofreading, copy editing, entry level jobs, graduates with degrees in English or communications.  Sigh....Fortunately, I write a BLOG, and can make all the errors I want.  Or, in most cases, don't want.And, finally, I am dog-sitting a dog named Wolf."},

{"title": "Little Did I Know", "date": "Wednesday, November 24, 2010", "text": "Day 289 of the \"What are you reading, and why?\" project, and little did I know when I mentioned the \"magical animal known as the pig\" recently that one of Harper Lee's apartments in New York is above Nancy Lee's Pig Heaven Restaurant.  A fact uncovered by columnist Jay C. Grelen, and quoted in Mockingbird, by Charles J. Shields.Little did I know, when I linked Harper Lee and Emily Dickinson in recipe mode here in my blog, and then later, this morning, discussing The Belle of Amherst, by William Luce, with a woman who is also writing a one-woman play, that I would come to think of them both, Dickinson and Harper Lee, as shy women with an abiding confidence in their work who would retreat from public life and publication for reasons of their own. Shields quotes Nelle Harper Lee as writing in a letter, \"People who have made peace with themselves are the people I most admire in the world.\"  She might not yet have made peace with herself when she wrote that, but I think she has now.  So does Shields, who says, \"From all indications, she seems to have done that.\" Likewise, some people watching The Belle of Amherst might think Emily Dickinson was not at peace, and some that she was, but I think she was.  I think she meant it when she came to say, \"Publication is the auction of the mind of man,\" and that she knew her work would live in the hearts and minds of those who would find it, and that it would be found, published or not.Little did I know, when I listed my stack of books to be read, that I would have to read Other Voices, Other Rooms, by Truman Capote (my ex-library first edition) next, though on a bookshelf, not a stack, at the time, because character Idabel Tompkins is based on Nelle Harper Lee.  Well, Kim, the inventor of serendipity-do, knew, because I told her.   And possibly Cindy Lou Who, knew, too, because children and fictional characters are so conveniently intuitive, and she is both, and so seasonal.Happy Thanksgiving, whether you are having turkey or the magical animal known as the ham."},

It's about Africa, a boy who makes friends with a Bushman, and how \"the living spirit needs a 'story' in order to survive\" (book blurb on rear cover).  I remember reading about this before, and yearning for it.But when, when, when can I read it?!  Things to read (stacked on desk & floor):Mockingbird (2/3 of the way through). Back on page 190 I encountered Harper Lee's recipe for cracklin' bread, which reminded me of Emily Dickinson's recipe for black cake.  Both are outlandish--Lee's because she is being funny and throwing out the pig to get the renderings used in cracklin' bread, which I learned about from a museum exhibit on kitchens last year.  Oh, and The Simpsons.  \"Sure, Lisa, there's a magical animal called the pig....\" Dickinson's, because her recipe is more than doubled, and intended to serve the whole town, apparently.Loving Frank (must re-read before book group in early December; must finish Mockingbird first).Omnivore's Dilemma (must read, having reminded myself of the magical animal known as the pig).Cyborgia (reading a few poems at a time; fantastic language and subject matter!)American Eve (part way through, set aside, must read before I give it away).The Death of Adam (still going slowly, requires great concentration, temporarily set aside).A fabulous box of poetry books that arrived in the mail yesterday from RHINO, which doesn't do reviews anymore, so I will!  (Here, or elsewhere.)And, by serendipity, The Utility of Heartbreak, a poetry chapbook by Charles Reynard, local judge, that arrived in my driveway today!  That is, Charley and I arrived at my driveway at the exact same time.  I was coming from the grocery store (bringing dinner and flour for tomorrow's baking of pumpkin bread!), and he was coming to deliver, and sign, at my kitchen table, the chapbook!!  Fortunately, chapbooks are short, and I have already read all these poems, so this will be a sweet dessert moment.Fear not.  Though I hugged him, I did not tousle his hair.  Nor put any serendipity-do on it."},

{"title": "I Am Curious George Yellow", "date": "Sunday, November 21, 2010", "text": "…and, as the beautiful yellow fall creeps inexorably toward white winter, I offer these poetic yellow daffodils as the reminder that spring will come again.On Day 286 of the \"What are you reading, and why?\" project, Kim has reported that first graders at Oakdale School will be reading all the Curious George books, as she helped stock the school library.  She also refers us to poetry by Marjorie Agosin, and she has recommended King Jesus, by Robert Graves, to my dad.Tom is recommending Divide’s Guide to the Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, by Joe Gioia, A Presentation for Modern Readers.  You can learn more about it at Cliffhanger Press.Meanwhile, Sarah of Babbitt’s Books posted a link to the New York Times article about Mark Twain’s autobiography “flying off the shelves” of new bookstores (which means we might not get one at Babbitt’s, a used bookstore, for some time) and connects this to the prolonged life of books in print!I just learned yesterday morning, at the tag end of the Sweet 16 slumber party, that my daughter was only reading a portion of Huckleberry Finn for school, but that they can earn extra credit by completing the book and taking a test to prove it.  So I encouraged her to do so, and that’s what she may be reading at the Normal Public Library while babysitting/supervising Kim’s kids upstairs on the library computers during the downstairs poetry reading this afternoon at 2:00 p.m.Tim Hunt will be reading from his new Finishing Line Press chapbook, Redneck Yoga, and poems from his other books, too, Fault Lines and the forthcoming White Levis.  You can read the two part interview with Tim here and here in this blog.Kathryn Kerr will be reading from Turtles All the Way Down, still on the new releases page, and I will read from Broken Sonnets and Living on the Earth, on the bookstore page at Finishing Line, and at Amazon.It’s always a bit awkward to promote one’s own work, but seems like it needs to be done.  Kelli Russell Agodon is having an interesting discussion of “branding” oneself at her blog, and not everybody is as literary-life shy as Harper Lee, nor as commerce-shy as I am. On the one hand, I can always come right out and say, “Please buy my book!” at a poetry event, and it comes out earnest and funny, which it is, and, on the other hand, I cannot.  One hand has the book in it, held up as a visual aid, and the other hand is empty!And, by the way, if you have actually read my book, please feel free to review it at Amazon or Goodreads, as it always appears that no one has ever read my poetry chapbooks, but I know from the kind comments of readers in person or in letters, that people have! (And I am curious and a bit yellow about this!)  And many thanks to Fiddler Crab and Comstock Review for their reviews!And, finally (almost), I think Babbitt’s has indeed had the occasional copy of I Am Curious (Yellow), and I have actually catalogued copies of I Am Curious (Blue), books based on the two Swedish films.  We shelve these far, far away from children.  Way high up, over a doorway.And, to circle back around, this time to Springfield Elementary School, you might recall “I Am Furious Yellow,” an episode of The Simpsons.OK, off to the kitchen, to bake chocolate chip cookies for the poetry reading, as the pale yellow butter should be softened by now!"},

Shields, which has come in and gone out of Babbitt's before, and she won the Pulitzer for To Kill a Mockingbird.  This book, with its careful introduction informing us that Shields wrote it without Harper Lee's cooperation, because, while she is a very community-minded person in her own community, she has been private about her writer life after a period of literary sociability, promises to tell me about her friendship with Truman Capote, the difficulties of that friendship (and I already know he lost a lot of friends), and why she never published a second novel.And Kathryn Erskine just won a National Book Award for her children's novel Mockingbird, about a girl with Asperger's syndrome, which has To Kill a Mockingbird in the background.  Erskine was one of four women honored with this award, as reported in this short article in Her Circle Ezine!Yesterday I was infected with Jon Stewart's anger, though everybody kept smiling, aroused by All the Devils are Here.  Today I am just glad to remember \"it's a sin to kill a mockingbird.\"  Even if they are sometimes annoying, in real life and in The Bat-Poet, by Randall Jarrell!"},
{"title": "A Curtain of Green", "date": "Friday, November 19, 2010", "text": "Day 284 of the \"What are you reading, and why?\" project, and Jon Stewart is reading All the Devils are Here, by Bethany McLean and Joe Nocera, and we all know why.  As the subtitle announces, it details The Hidden History of the Financial Crisis and exposes the bad guys, who, according to Nocera in the Daily Show interview, still don't think they did anything wrong and blame it all on people who couldn't pay their mortgages.You can find that episode and the extended interview, which made the authors late for their own book party, at Comedy Central, and you can find reviews out the wazoo.  What I'll riff on today is the epigraph that gives the book its title, \"Hell is empty, and all the devils are here,\" which is not only an album by a heavy metal band, as I just learned from Wikipedia, but a line from Shakespeare's play, The Tempest, which I heard again this summer in the Illinois Shakespeare Festival production.Ariel says it to Prospero, reporting on the storm and shipwreck that has just deposited on the island the very men who wronged Prospero in the past and on whom he might wish for revenge...but interestingly Ariel is quoting Ferdinand, the King's son, an innocent, horrified by it all.  And, since it won't spoil things to say so, revenge is not what happens.  There is forgiveness, love, and marriage; there is resumed responsibility to the human community.  There is a decision to leave off the magic that can rouse such a storm.  In Shakespeare's plays, everybody gets to learn something.One hopes we learn something from the financial crisis, but we've been here before.  McLean and Nocera say the business world is already at it again, creating new \"financial products,\" and starting up the money-and-power-greed machine.  Anyone who's read The Way We Live Now, by Anthony Trollope, or seen the fabulous mini-series, knows that's still the way we live now. Still riffing.  But wait!  What about Eudora Welty and A Curtain of Green?  I'm getting there.  And I'm just now getting to the end of Saving Jesus from the Church, by Robin Meyers.  **pause to finish Epilogue**  Whew.  In this book, Meyers warns about the Gospel of Prosperity, that religion of transaction that's apparently still rampant in the land.  We've been there, too--televangelists and popular preachers taking your money, themselves \"prospering\" and/or telling you that God wants you to have yours.  That if you believe the right things, success will come your way. \"Success,\" said Martin Buber (quoted in Meyers) \"is not one of the names of God.\" Shouldn't we know that by now?  From life, and from books?! Elmer Gantry, by Sinclair Lewis, exposes a con man who's selling religion as a commodity.  Another customer in the store yesterday--and this is one of those times when it's a wonderful irony to work in a shop called Babbitt's Books--said, \"Elmer Gantry is such a good book!\"But what he was walking out with, and what he's reading now, is the Selected Stories of Eudora Welty, containing A Curtain of Green and The Wide Net.  I happen to have the Modern Library edition of this, green hardcover, and it's got the real green world in it, not the facade of green that businesses like BP use to get you to buy their...gas.  No, not that gassy curtain of green, that cascade-of-money green.Of A Curtain of Green, the New York Times reviewer Marianne Hauser said, back in November 1941, \"Many of the stories are dark, weird and often unspeakably sad in mood, yet there is no trace of personal frustration in them, neither harshness nor sentimental resignation; but an alert, constant awareness of life as a whole, and that profound, intuitive understanding of life which enables the artist to accept it.\"  Welty shows you the world.  She doesn't judge it, but she loves it.  \"On each page one senses the author's fanatic love of people.\"This reviewer, who \"feel[s] certain that her stories will live for a long time,\" also notes that they are cut out of time, and could happen anywhere.  \"There are no wars going on behind the scenes, no revolutions or headline-disasters. The tragedies which Miss Welty invokes occur in the backyards of life.\"  They are occurring there now, too.  There are wars going on; there are headline-disasters; but people who couldn't pay their mortgages are having a hard time, people who lost their jobs are having a hard time, and people are still making it through in their quiet or desperate suffering, even if they lost their back yards.Robin Meyers would say, \"Help them.\"Eudora Welty would say, \"Love them.\" According to McLean and Nocera, Wall Street would say, \"F*!$ them.\"  And did.***And to carry on from yesterday, because \"What is Reading, But Silent Conversation?\", I will send you off to Drew Moody's Pulitzer blog, which invites you to a reading conversation!"},

Actually, just a couple months ago, I chatted with a woman reading this at a little table on the sidewalk in front of the coffeehouse....The Death and Life of Great American Cities, by Jane Jacobs.The Death and Life of Charlie St. Cloud, by Ben Sherwood. Baseball, brotherly love, now a major motion picture.The Death and Life of Malcolm X by Peter Goldman.OK, that's enough.  I've gone beyond delight.  But, wait!  What about The Death and Life of Sneaky Fitch, by James L. Rosenberg, a play?!  That's delightful.  In the long ago past, I played a saloon girl in a yellow dress in that play, recalling Gunsmoke on tv in my childhood....."},

Half seen a couple days ago: Deirdre, a character in Irish myth, as she appears in a portion of The Hound of Ulster, retold by Rosemary Sutcliff.  This book came in at Babbitt's, and I was flipping through it to check for interior soil or flaws and there she was, Deirdre--aka Deirdre of the Sorrows, her story retold by others as well, such as W. B. Yeats and J. M. Synge, including Eileen Favorite in The Heroines, where Deirdre stops for a while in a bed and breakfast (more time weaving), and we don't see her awful ending, but in The Hound of Ulster, we do.And we hear of the twisting branches of two tall yew trees, grown from their separate graves, where jealous Conchobhar had them buried, to join in love and in defiance of what had kept them apart.And, of course, I need to send you to Wikipedia for The Birth of Venus, by Sandro Botticelli, and Venus on the Half Shell, by Kilgore Trout.  Or is it Philip Jose Farmer?!"},

He has also been reading William Slusher, if I heard him right, \"because I couldn't put the book down,\" but I don't know which book it was, as he didn't mention the title.  I'll choose For Whom to Die: A Beautiful Story of a Terrible Time, a Vietnam story, because of its title, and it was the first one I found at Amazon, and because of the recent Veterans Day holiday. Another fellow came in looking for 10 Steps to Abundant Health by somebody named Jackson.  I sent him to Health and to Self Help, but we didn't have it.  Later he revealed that he'd been overseas, troubled, and looked up to see this book in the rafters, and it turned his life around.  Now he wanted to find it for a friend in need.  He said somebody at Amazon had it for over $100.Ah, yes.  It's called The Ten Secrets of Abundant Health: A Modern Parable that Will Turn Your Life Around, by Adam J. Jackson.  Indeed, it starts at $110 in the Amazon Marketplace, and I fear it is a self-help book in a series of self-help books, which sometimes, you know, are there to help you help yourself, and sometimes are there to help the author help hirself.Sure enough, Adam J. Jackson has also written Ten Secrets of Abundant Wealth, subtitled Ancient Chinese Wisdom to Enhance Your Life.  Ancient wisdom that has probably enhanced Adam Jackson's life, and wealth. But I sound cynical and judgmental and don't want to be.  The man seeking the book did find his life turned around, and does want to help a friend.  And, hey, I just read a sort of self-help version of Epictetus!  (But I blame J. D. Salinger for that.)What I'm getting at, I hope, is that we read some books at just the right time.  There is a powerful story in Poetry East #47-48, They Say This by the poet Bruce Weigl.  He was 18, in Vietnam, sick in bed at base camp from bad water, and a man threw a book at him and said, \"Read this.\"  It was Dostoevsky.  Crime and Punishment.  And it turned his life around.Any book could do it.  A great one, like Crime and Punishment.  Ancient Chinese wisdom, updated.  Stoic philosophy, revisited.  A self-help book.  Such as The Ten Secrets of Abundant Happiness.  A mass market paperback for $64.99.Or this version, used, starting at $58.31:But if it will make you happy, read it."},
{"title": "Lucky Ducks", "date": "Sunday, November 14, 2010", "text": "Day 279  of the \"What are you reading, and why?\" project, and my daughter is reading The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, by Mark Twain, because it is assigned reading in her American Literature class and has not (thus far) been banned!!It's one of the books, along with To Kill a Mockingbird, by Harper Lee,* and Of Mice and Men, by John Steinbeck, that routinely gets put on somebody's \"banned\" list because of what happens in it and because of the language of the times, which in these cases, involves racism. Alas! Since the message in all three of these books, if anyone bothered to read them, is against racism.  The trouble with literature is so often that nobody is really reading, nobody is paying attention, nobody is looking closely or past the surface. Perhaps I overstate.  I respect the real issues here, but I think a good book stands as literature and a record of the social injustices of a given time.  I have had no trouble with troublesome language in my own classrooms.  I choose not to say the \"n-word\" aloud, given its negative historical charge during my own lifetime, but I leave it to my students to choose to say it aloud or not in our classroom, if we are reading aloud, and always feel they can read it silently and handle it and put it in its context, and they always can.  Quite maturely and responsibly.  Of course we discuss in advance what is appropriate classroom speech, when we are just talking, and we do not use language that would insult each other.  Again, students are quite respectful of one another when given the chance.*Harper Lee was the name of one of my cats.So far, no controversy has arisen in the local high schools this year, but even since my return to this area in 2000, there was a flurry of trouble about books assigned at the high school level, which led to my research paper assignment for my college students: find a book that has been banned, or put on somebody's \"banned book\" list at some time in some community, or caused a controversy, and say why.I left it to them to argue whether a particular book should or shouldn't have been \"banned\" or put on some list, and they made all sorts of wonderful arguments. Mostly, they didn't want the book to have been banned, they saw its value, and they loved it when they had read it in school, but sometimes they agreed that the book might be too much for a certain age group, and ought to be taught, for example, not freshman year but maybe junior or senior year of high school. I love my students! Loved, as my college students are in the past..., but, of course, I still love them! I loved my high school students, too, whom I taught (as a replacement teacher when I first moved back to town) for three dreadful months, in which I went to work, came home, fed my family, and went to bed, pulling the blanket over my head in despair sometimes as early as 6:30 p.m. We read To Kill a Mockingbird together. Some refused to read, but came alive when we acted out the trial scene in class. And then cried when they saw Boo Radley for the first time, watching the film.And I love my current students, of all ages, in the rare book room at Babbitt's, including my mom! Yes, yes, I love and \"teach\" my mom!Speaking of my mom, my daughter was also recently reading the 1988 NCHS Yearbook, the Reverie, in which my mom, her grandmother, appears as the Old Loon in a play called Lucky Ducks, written by a man who still currently teaches at my daughter's high school! Perhaps the playwright will stumble upon my blog, care to comment, and identify himself. Perhaps the Old Loon will do likewise."},

C. Boyle. Arthur Pillsbury was Wright's contemporary, had similar training, a pretty wife from a prominent family, a prolific career in a life cut short,* and, evidently, \"a passion for detail.\"Indeed, one of the panelists clarified by compare and contrast that while everyone can recognize the Frank Lloyd Wright \"style,\" Pillsbury worked in a number of styles, according to the wishes of the homeowner, but his designs were unified by the care taken with the detail.  Another panelist went one further, saying \"Wright always did it the 'Wright' way\" but that Pillsbury listened and created the desired home.  And then a woman who had arrived late turned out to be an interior designer who had lived in four different Pillsbury homes, each a bit larger, and each \"eminently livable.\"  She called Pillsbury \"prophetic\" in the sense of being able to design a home in the early 1900s that would be comfortable and adaptable to life here in the 2000s.Pillsbury had a busy time of it in Bloomington, Illinois after the great fire of 1900.  He was engaged in the rebuilding of the McLean County Courthouse (now the home of the museum and this exhibit) and much of the downtown, he built churches, and numerous residences, many still standing and, indeed, \"eminently livable.\"   The audience was packed with people living in his homes, which this month have blue banners in front of them in honor of the exhibit.So, while there are countless books on Frank Lloyd Wright, who will write the great book on Arthur L. Pillsbury?  Will it be Greg Koos, director of the museum, who encourages a discussion of a print-on-demand publication possibility, to make it affordable, given the art reproductions.  Will it be a set of at least four museum interns, as curator Susan Hartzold suggests, from architecture programs, who might set it up as a website?  Or might it be museum archivist Bill Kemp, author of this fabulous article on Pillsbury.  Or some combination of the above?Cute in a different way than the Pillsbury Dough Boy, eh?*Kemp's article mentions the untimely death of Pillsbury, at 56, in a car accident, coming home from a University of Illinois football game.  I remember it well, having written about it in the annual cemetery walk one year.  And now the local poets in my rare book room workshop will visit the architecture exhibit and write poems in response.  They'll see renderings, photographs, and objects, including the scary wolf head that used to look out from the 6th floor of a building downtown.  A passionate detail."},

So, on Thursday, an old customer came in and is now reading The New Life, by Orhan Pamuk, because he's read three other books by Pamuk that he liked, because Pamuk won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2006, and because he likes Turkey--he's visited--and the intrigues set in Turkish history and locales in Pamuk's novels.Babette certainly loves her new life in the bookstore, where she is well-loved, well-fed, and lives quite happily the life of a chair thief.A young man came in from the half-price cart parked outside for the whole November day with a like-new copy of The Way of the Pilgrim and The Pilgrim Continues His Way (in the edition translated by R. M. French and introduced by Huston Smith.)  I think I got a little overly excited, as the young man promised to bring it back when he was done.  My excitement was not religious, even though the theme of this book is \"to pray without ceasing,\" but literary, as this is the book Franny is carrying around in Franny and Zooey, by J.D. Salinger, and I've been wanting to read it ever since I re-read that book for book group, and also ever since Salinger died.  It's the story of a Russian peasant on a spiritual journey, and, if the young man brings it back, I will indeed read it.  That particular copy, because of the sweetness of the conversation, and the act of returning.  Life is a constant wonder.Other old customers came in to see Babette and brought her 3 mouse toys--one white, one gray, one black--and a little bag of \"catweed.\"  Babette had a very exciting afternoon, hopping about the store with her mice, and then a very sudden and much-needed nap in a paper grocery bag.And, speaking of mice, Sarah is reading Maus, by Art Spiegelman, the two volumes in one edition, which passed through my hands, got catalogued, and now she can't give it up,\" so she will buy it, the main hazard of working in a bookstore.And that is the daily report."},

You can find it there in new releases right now, and also on the Science Fiction page and the Women's page, as it's a kind of \"cyborg feminism,\" as Brandi Homan says in a blurb on the back cover.Wow! It's going to be one of those I read slowly, taking in all the rich exciting images, and learning about cyborgs and everything else. Right now I am taking in the very first poem \"Postcorporeal\" and all the ways it zings in my life (and recent blog posts) right now.  \"Look, changeling,\" it begins.  \"No one would suspect / the monsterskin rustling / beneath your latex fleshtones.\"The super feminine fleshtones you see above are by Susan Jamison, and I send you to her feature at Escape Into Life, where I've also recently mounted (hmm) the next poetry feature, by Carolyn Sheehan Gandouin, an Australian poet I met in cyberspace.But back to Susan Slaviero for the moment, and \"Postcorporeal,\" which offered me today the coincidence of the phrase \"Your surface etching.\" And the glorious line, \"Naked, you are all hello, holograph.\"I love it when my life is a lovely lazy river of random coincidii.And the river runs alongside the trains in recent blog posts, providing this morning on Poetry Radio, WGLT, my own poem, \"Blue Basket,\" which has a train in it, a station, a rolling suitcase, and a distant wailing."},

Watts.Despite the provocative title, it is not a romance novel, as its subtitle clarifies: Spirituality and Religion for the 21st Century.  It is the \"unusual collaboration\" of Watts and Unitarian minister Carl Esenwein, who died four years ago, and, at Watts's request, bequeathed his papers to Watts.  The book that results is a weaving together of their thoughts and words.My dad read it first and calls it \"eloquent.\"  He says it doesn't \"advocate\" anything at the end, leaving things open.  This prevents him from arguing back, which annoys him, and saves us all from argument, but evidently it is an excellent introduction to \"liberal religion.\"  My folks are reading it as a softcover book, but it is available at Book Locker, which provides numerous reading formats, including your iPhone.My mom and I met up for lunch today, by way of the dentist's office.  At our last cleaning and checkup, we were delighted to discover each other in the waiting room, so we made our next appointments on the same day.  And on February 2, Groundhog's Day, we will meet at the dentist's office again.  For any of you who know and love the film Groundhog Day, this may indeed be an existential or spiritual coincidence.  (But, according to Sartre, not both.)

And Poets House!I read a book of poetry today, This Awkward Art, by Conrad Hilberry and Jane Hilberry.  Another \"unusual collaboration,\" this time a father and daughter.  They had written the poems separately, but have shared experiences, so the poems group and weave beautifully.  This can be had at Mayapple Press.And this mother/daughter dental team had pumpkin pancakes* for lunch, at Wildberries.*For a vegan recipe for the ones you see above, click here."},
{"title": "Room Not of One's Own", "date": "Tuesday, November 9, 2010", "text": "Day 274 of the \"What are you reading?\" project and Garnett has been reading Room, by Emma Donoghue. She says it's \"a real page-turner, a chilling story and amazingly fresh 5-year-old narrator who manages to sound poetic without sounding too cute or contrived.\"It really is about a room, a life trapped in a room, and you can enter the Room of the book here, if you dare. I think I am as scared of all the clicking and dragging--at the book's website--as I am of the plot. A bad man has stolen a young woman, kept her there, raped her, impregnated her, and now she has to keep her son safe.But if you enter the website, you can see the layout of the room. And at the home page, you can read what Audrey Niffenegger, author of Time Traveler's Wife, has to say about Room:  \"Room is a book to read in one sitting. When it's over you look up: the world looks the same but you are somehow different and that feeling lingers for days.\"Garnett had a similar reaction. She said, \"There were parts of Donaghue's book where I forgot I was reading.\"I'd be a little afraid to enter that room, via technology or imagination, but it sounds like quite a powerful reading experience. You can read about it more conventionally via the New York Times book review here.To follow up on a previous post, Barry Silesky has “entered” the conversation about his spiritual reading and questing and said, “No, you're not wrong. Only for sake of any clarification, I mean atheism literally--absence of anything ordinarily involved in the concept, 'God.' There may be a supra-human force; but I doubt any entity; whatever it is I suspect is our imagination. Which (imagination) might be, and I suspect is, the only divinity there is.”I think he may still comment to speak for himself, but for now I’m quoting from his email. His follow-up email said, “If only I knew what to pray to. The trouble with this atheism is, I'm stuck with myself.” Quite a dilemma."},
{"title": "Holy Coincidii, Bat Poets!", "date": "Monday, November 8, 2010", "text": "Day 273 of the \"What are you reading, and why?\" project, and first let me send you to The Bat-Poet, by Randall Jarrell, illustrated by Maurice Sendak, a favorite book of mine and a lovely holiday gift, if you are getting in that kind of mood, used or new from HarperCollins. I have two used copies, one hardcover, one paperback, both slightly damp-stained, but clean on the inside, poems and illustrations intact. It's pretty much a perfect book for poet adults to read to their kids, as it's a how-to-be-a-poet book with talking animals that helps you like and understand poets better. And not like critics and academics quite so much, though the mockingbird is still much admired by our innocent bat.But, lest you think I am reliving my childhood, or living in the past, let me reassure you. I am!Way too many poignant coincidii lately. For instance, we often listen to the Jimmy Durante station on Pandora at work. He sang this today, \"September Song,\" a gorgeous song with schmaltzy background singers and orchestra, rescued from utter sentimentality by his honesty, his big nose, and his gritty cigarette.Anyhoo, yesterday I mentioned the John Knoepfle interview in Fifth Wednesday, and early this morning I read it, along with his poems. At the end of the interview, Knoepfle talks about how being 87 is affecting his writing and publishing of poetry. He realizes that if a new book is accepted, called Stay With Us, it will still be 2 years till it is published. He's not worried about this, just aware. At the end of the interview, he says:You know the lines from scripture: \"Stay with us because it is almost evening and the day is now nearly over.\" How can I tell you this?  Not an occasion for fear or being heartsick.  I know whom the two men on the road were inviting to supper.  In a graceful interlude, I might be able to be there at Emmaus.Well, the scripturally aware will have caught the central allusion in my poem from yesterday's blog entry, \"On the Road.\"  In my pencilled draft, it was actually called \"On the Road to Emmaus\" and \"to Emmaus\" also appeared in a line in the poem. But I realized that it wasn't needed, and might lead people astray. When I inhabit that speaker, I make him simply a traveler on the road. Not Jesus. Any man, any woman (yes, \"just a slob like one of us, just a stranger on a bus\"--hear it in Jim Carrey's voice from Bruce Almighty for ideal effect) to be welcomed and invited to the table.  And not a ghost, not a vision, nothing supernatural, and not a \"resurrected corpse\" as Robin Meyers would say. But Emmaus was of course the inspiration, so to find it in the interview made me say, \"Holy Truffle, Mr. Knoepfle!\"And at the Fifth Wednesday event, I asked Barry Silesky how he was doing with his health and his grief. He said he was doing a lot of reading as he heads toward the end, and that, of course, a lot of it is about religion, and it was pretty much leading him toward atheism. Meaning, I think, no particular personal literal god, as there is lots of correspondence between the myths and narratives and basic values of multiple religions, and no linear, geographical afterlife.  (He can correct me if I'm wrong! Barry, I mean, not YHWH.) I was just about to ask if any of the reading included Karen Armstrong when he said, \"I'm reading a lot of Karen Armstrong.  The History of God is good.\"  Barry lost a son, a wife (not to death), and has MS, getting out infrequently but pretty darn well in a motorized wheelchair, and, like John Knoepfle, seems to be looking at things pretty clearly and calmly.  It was so good to see him!And now you know for sure that I'm a bit batty!"},

{"title": "Redneck Yoga", "date": "Saturday, November 6, 2010", "text": "Day 271...and here is the rest of the Tim Hunt interview.  He is the author of several books, including scholarly works on Jack Kerouac and Robinson Jeffers, but the three discussed here are his own books/chapbooks of poetry Fault Lines, Redneck Yoga (just now coming out from Finishing Line Press), White Levis, and 'Til Twangdom Come.  This will be of special interest to poets figuring out how to put a book together.You can hear \"Redneck Yoga\" here at the WGLT Poetry Radio page!  Read on and you'll find another poem at the end of the interview.Is Fault Lines a book you set out to write? Or did you find yourself writing poems that linked up with each other and wove themes? Or something else? How did it come together as a book?I stopped writing for many years, partly because the logic of what poems were supposed to be (at least as I’d learned that from my schooling) left me little sense of there being anyone on the other side of the page. To make poems seemed wasteful and empty. After a time I came to see that this was in part because I’d let myself be talked into believing that poems are things that we make—writing on the surface of a page. I realized that poetry could also be, instead, acts of speaking stored in writing—that poetry could be (in spite of the page and writing) an attempt to speak to and with other people. That’s one factor that’s shaped Fault Lines. Another was a sense that the past dies if we don’t express it, and if we lose the past (or rather some sense of connecting to a past) the present becomes terribly thin. The past is one aspect of how we orient ourselves to be fully in the present and to find our ways forward. The poem “When the Back Steps Seemed Very High” touches on this. The things we remember and find through the process of remembering are the proverbial mixed blessing, but a mixed blessing beats no blessing any day.Can you compare and contrast it a bit with the book just now coming out, Redneck Yoga, in terms of process and content? And White Levis?The chapbook White Levis mixes a handful of pieces that refused to braid into Fault Lines with newer poems that extend the direction of the fourth section. The chapbook Redneck Yoga is more of a veer—poems where I let my lippy inner redneck off the leash and he went off chasing squirrels and rabbits. The new book-length ms., ’Til Twangdom Come, sort of splits the difference between Fault Lines and Redneck Yoga. It’s out knocking on doors looking for a home. A main difference between Fault Lines and these newer projects is that I’m writing more quickly. I guess that’s partly a matter of trusting the process more. It’s probably, also, partly a matter of being able to focus more on the poetry, having shut the door on some other things in my life.  It also seems as if I’m more apt now to see things as possible multi-poem sets. The sequence “The Further Adventures of Poem” in Twangdom, is an instance of this. When we’re first writing, especially if we draw in part on personal material, it can seem like material is precious and that it can run out—only so much ore in the mine, that sort of thing. It takes a while to learn, and to trust, that each poem can call up the next one.

we operate in terms of structures that are necessarily partial.  From time to time that wholeness we’ve so carefully constructed and has come to be reality fractures.  In a geological sense, the ground is never fully stable or permanent; neither is the psychological (or the social, if that’s more what it is) “ground.”  Sometimes we remember or bump against what we haven’t included.  It’s like a child who falls and breaks an arm.  Sometimes the arm heals stronger, sometimes not, but we each time the ground shifts, the terrain is not quite the same.I love the light in this book, its variations.  I love how you set up that there are kinds of light in “The Language of Light,” a poem for your son, who sees these differences.  How does he like this poem?  And can you tell us more about the importance of light in your poetry?John is both a visual artist and a writer, and his comment quoted in the poem evokes both his eye and ear.  That of course is really the poem.  I think he likes the piece well enough.  At least he’s been very good natured about my co-opting his line.  We lived on a ranch in the White Mountain Desert of eastern California for several years.  In the high desert country, light is a part of the landscape, not simply a backdrop.  It’s part of the landscape’s language.  That’s true everywhere, but that became clearer to me at Deep Springs, and John’s comment helped me realize that.  It’s a matter of listening.  We live much of our life indoors and in constructed environments.  Those environments are rich and meaningful, but it’s also important to step outside, to step aside.  Light, it seems, can help us do that.“The Language of Light” for me connects to Prescript (Poetry) at the very beginning of the book, where it sits like an epigraph for the whole contents.  So, two questions:1)       Is there an actual name for that kind of pre-poem?Not that I’m aware of.  The poems in Fault Lines (as with many first collections) were written at different times from varied perspectives.  That was a poem I wanted to use, but it wasn’t fitting elsewhere in the book.  Then I hit on placing it as a kind of preliminary or introductory piece, which is when I added “Prescript” to the title.2)      Is this prescript poem your ars poetica, or statement about the nature of poetry?I mistrust the notion that poems say something, and I especially mistrust the notion that they are complicated codes for saying something simple.  My sense is that poems are often ways we attend to things that matter but that don’t fully resolve or allow themselves to be reduced to statements that we can file away under various tabs.  If poems were statements, Spark Notes paraphrases would not only suffice, they’d be better than the poems.  To the extent that that piece reflects this sense of things it could, I guess, be seen as a kind of ars poetica, but a partial one.  My hope, though, is that the piece might function more as an ars readica.To be clear about the connection I see here, Prescript (Poetry) includes a memory, precise and clear, of light on a puddle of water, and is about the sensibility of someone who would indeed notice and remember such a thing.  In “The Language of Light,” the small boy speaks of light in a precise way, and one senses he must grow up to be a poet or artist because that’s the way he sees.Right.  The world is fuller, richer than our understandings of it, which necessarily are entangled with the ways our awareness is filtered through our cognitive adaptations.  When we see something intensely, clearly, we sense both our connections to this fuller reality and our inability to completely comprehend it.  Our consciousness is both heightened and we are taken beyond consciousness.  Poems can do and be many things.  One thing they can do is enact a kind of witness to things that outstrip our ability to express and contain.You and I have a similar aesthetic sense, I think, in that we believe simplicity of language can express complexity of thought, ambivalence in feeling, and mystery or paradox in meaning.  Is that correct? Yes.  Complexity of perception, not complexity of expression.There are several family stories in Fault Lines, and some elegies.  Two questions here: are you ever hesitant to expose too much about a family member, and how do you handle privacy issues like this?  My second question is a version of one that editor Michael Latza asked me, in Willow Review.  How do you avoid sentimentality in family poems?  Family is another word for history and region.  The poems in Fault Lines that draw on family material are, by and large, less about psychological foibles or eccentricities than they are attempts to explore how we relate to region and time through the lens of family.  Urban life opens certain kinds of awareness, but rural and small town life open others.  As the urban and digital domains become more and more the only worlds we know, I think there’s some value in attending, also, to this other terrain.  The sense of space, of time, of connection, isolation are different in the hills than they are at the El stop or the megamall.  Seeing the fire burn the mountain is different than sound bites and video clips on the evening news.  Knowing how people can struggle with their interconnected histories is different than the exhilaration and emptiness of feeling as if one has no history.  Family is one way to access that, engage that.  As to “sentimentality”: that’s a matter of perspective.  Some people seem to think that feeling and responsiveness are “sentimentality.”  If the emotional dimension of a poem is an escape rather than an engagement, that’s a problem.  But poems aren’t simply thought acrostics.  I stopped worrying a long time ago about being sentimental.  If my relationship to the world is sentimental, the poems will be, as well, and they’ll suffer for it.  But that’s a risk one has to run."},

It is signed by the editor and annotator, Salvador Fajardo, and our young man might come back for it, or let someone know what he wants for Christmas.

Stevenson, II, none of which (even the Stevenson) was any form of electioneering.  (I have a wonderful odd life!)I joined the interview with Stamberg saying, \"Once Pinter started writing — in his studio at the bottom of their garden — he worked in a tear,\" something I can identify with as a writer.  Fraser said he would get into bed and out again, to write some more.Since I joined the interview in progress, I missed the story of their meeting, the reason for the title of the book, the scandal, et cetera, but I had heard about some of this before and I got caught up by reading at the NPR site.  This is a book I would like to read, a gathering together of incidents and insights from Fraser's diary during her years with Pinter.  And as she is a wonderful biographer herself, I'm sure it is well done.Stamberg asked Fraser to read the poem \"Paris,\" the first poem he wrote to her.  I came right home and read the poem again in Harold Pinter's Collected Poems & Prose, the first Grove Press edition, a gift from a playwright friend.  My friend got to hear Pinter speak toward the end of his life and found him blunt and curmudgeonly, rude even, but perhaps that was partly due to his long struggle with cancer, and partly due to the state of the world as he was saying goodbye to it. Pinter won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2005.But then he had to go."},

Also not there today, nor on Thursday, when I found it online for her with another used bookseller: the 1958 Illinois State University yearbook, called The Index, edited by a woman who was also one of my junior high school teachers.  I looked online again, and it was already gone, though there were other years, just not one she'd edited.  Somebody bought up all the local copies recently, probably to sell on eBay.  Sigh....There, but not in the house of the author, who might buy an ex-library copy from us at Babbitt's because she loaned her own to someone who never returned it: The History of Street Railways in Bloomington-Normal, Illinois, by Red and Mary Rozum.  It's always a little odd when an author calls or emails to order his or her (hir) own book!  I told her I hoped the boss would give her a discount!And not there yet in my yearning little hands, but heard of by my yearning little ears on NPR, are these two books:Origins: How the Nine Months Before Birth Shape the Rest of Our Lives, by Annie Murphy Paul.  Here's a great brief essay by her at NPR that you can read or listen to, and below that an excerpt from the book itself.This made me recall a book that is not there on my shelf, because I gave it to a midwife friend:  Having Faith: An Ecologist's Journey to Motherhood, by Sandra Steingraber.And, lest you think I am math-challenged, which I am, here is the second NPR book, one I want to read with my book group, because I loved Bee Season:The False Friend, by Myla Goldberg.  I did not happen to hear this NPR story back on Wednesday, but I read the excerpt today.  A women remembers a childhood friend and some bad behavior that evidently led to the death of the friend.  Ouch.  Talk about atonement....Nor have I read Atonement, by Ian McEwan, but I have seen the movie, which does make me want to read the book, even though I will already know what happens.  But that's the way Flannery O'Connor likes it.  Skip the suspense and focus on what the people do, and why, and ponder what they (or you) should be doing instead. Flannery would know that today is All Saints Day, and what that's about.  I don't, really.  Except that it's connected to All Souls' Day, and the Day of the Dead, which reminds me of little sugar skulls and skeletons.And the dearly departed."},

But, as Mark warns, and in honor of Halloween, we should be scared of editions that present the poems not as Emily wrote them!!  Instead, hacked, maimed, and disguised by editors who chose to conventionalize her.And it's always fun to see what Seana is reading or discovering over at Not New for Long!  (Currently A Corpse in the Koryo, by James Church.)I just remembered I have an Emily Dickinson dress in my closet, from past performances of The Belle of Amherst.  I could go as Emily Dickinson for Halloween!!"},
{"title": "What Would Epictetus Do?", "date": "Saturday, October 30, 2010", "text": "Day 264 of the \"What are you reading, and why?\" project, and I am still reading Epictetus, because he was a favorite of the Glass family created by J. D. Salinger, and because a former colleague of mine wrote about him in a book review, mentioned in this earlier blog entry, which also, probably by not-so-random coincidence, also mentions Saving Jesus From the Church, by Robin Meyers, a book being read by even more of the local community after his speech last night and workshops this morning (going on even as I write!).That is, I am reading The Art of Living: The Classical Manual on Virtue, Happiness, and Effectiveness, a new interpretation of Epictetus's manual by Sharon Lebell.  This reads like a self help book; gives me the insight that many, many self-help books are revisiting older, wiser, deeper books of ancient philosophy; and makes Epictetus seems like the ancient Greek Dr. Phil; but it's still, distilled to its essence, good stuff.It's good in that it helps me review and re-evaluate my life, and ask myself the question, \"What would Epictetus do?\" For example, this passage gave me pause:By considering the big picture, you distinguish yourself from the mere dabbler, the person who plays at things as long as they feel comfortable or interesting.  This is not noble.  Think things through and fully commit!  Otherwise, you will be like a child who sometimes pretends he or she is a wrestler, sometimes a soldier, sometimes a musician, sometimes an actor in a tragedy.Since I have done a lot of things, and have actually been an actor in a tragedy, I had to think about this for a bit.  (Also paused to consider, \"When I was a child, I spake as a child....\")  Indeed, in my little essay in Her Circle, I recount all the things I tried in the arts on my way to being a writer, and I became aware that some readers, never having known me or worked with me, might dismiss me as a dabbler or dilettante (those dreaded \"d\" words)! But Epictetus would remind me not to be concerned with what others think of me, as that is out of my control (and ignoble).Unless we fully give ourselves over to our endeavors, we are hollow, superficial people and we never develop our natural gifts.Again, I pause to remember my father's advice, \"You have a responsibility to your talent,\" very Epictetan, as it turns out, as I began my life in the arts, and both my parents have deep respect for people who nurture and develop their natural gifts, and have provided moral and practical support for their own and other people's children all their adult lives.  What a lucky girl I am to have parents like mine!We've all known people who, like monkeys, mimic whatever seems novel and flashy at the moment.  But then their enthusiasm and efforts wane; they drop their projects as soon as they become too familiar or demanding.We probably do all know people like this, and once I got to this passage I found a mix of relief and consternation.  I probably stayed a bit too long at some projects.  Patience is a dubious virtue at times, perhaps, and persistence, too!  If I had been truly responsible to my talent, as my father advised, and realistic in my goals and views, I might have left some of my pursuits sooner! Be honest with yourself.  Clearly assess your strengths and weaknesses.  Do you have what it takes to compete at this time?I don't think I have the vocal instrument to be a stage actress.  I worked in small intimate theatres, mostly, hmm, but also school gymnasiums, where my voice carried just fine.  And I could have developed my physical voice, seeking out a voice teacher, et cetera, as my sister did, but I didn't.  I think my inner voice told me otherwise, and I developed my writing voice instead, daily, as I have since childhood.Likewise, I recognize now, as I did not when starting out, that I do not have the right kind of ambition to succeed as an actress in the put-yourself-out-there world of auditioning and selling oneself.  I am not good at it, and cannot make myself do it.  In fact, I do not have the right kind of ambition to succeed in any conventional endeavor during the time I happen to be living!  I like doing the thing, not selling it, not striving for the next thing.  That may make me childish still, in a way, but, if so, it is also a joyful way to be.But it doesn't seem as childish, really, as having an enthusiasm and dropping it.  I like doing the work.  In acting and in writing, the work IS play for me, and I love doing it.  An actor friend, now also engaged in a more bookish life, had the insight that he loved rehearsing, doing the work, as well as performing, but that he met many actors who hated rehearsing and just wanted to perform, and, of course, it was rather hard to work with them in rehearsal!!Different people are made for different things. I think I am on the right path.  Now and always, or back on the right path.  I loved poetry from childhood on, and learned about it in immersion in dramatic literature as well as other kinds.  Being an actor helped me overcome personal shyness and taught me about what I love. \"Fear not,\" said Robin Meyers in his speech last night, quoting all the angels and Jesus, the teacher.  I must not fear laying it all out like this.  I must not fear being called, considered, or dismissed as a \"dabbler.\"  I must not fear being called or considered an amateur, another word for dilettante.  An amateur is someone who does it for love.  I am that.  And I am professional in all my pursuits.  I remember that, I know that, and I have worked with \"professionals\" who merely \"phone it in.\" (Do not compare yourself to others, Epictetus would here warn.)I am mostly patient, mostly persistent.  Mostly, with moments of grave doubt, I know what I am."},

This musical is not based on that!  (But a Simpsons episode is!)Evening Primrose is about a poet (yay!) who lives in a department store at night because the real world, the daytime world, is too scary.  And, as Pam told me, right after my driveway moment just before book group, the evening primrose is just that, a flower that opens in the evening, and can be watched opening as if \"in time lapse photography.\"And guess who is in Evening Primrose?!  Anthony Perkins, post-Psycho (also scary) and Charmian Carr of The Sound of Music (scary only to those who fear musicals), who wrote the book Forever Liesl, also featured, back when it came out in 2000, on NPR.  (Maybe she would not have been forever Liesl if Evening Primrose had been more readily available.  Maybe there will be a live production of it now, and Graham Norton can seek out a new actress for it.  See Nancy Devine's blog entry on this!)To learn more about evening primrose and its health benefits, go here.  To learn more about the zen biz of evening primrose, go here.  And you can find song lyrics books by Cole Porter and Oscar Hammerstein, II at Babbitt's at the moment.  I look forward to Finishing the Hat, and you'll find Sondheim in fine form, 80 and fiesty, in the NPR interview.  He is bleeped a lot, talking about some lyrics he wanted in West Wide Story, but I really, really like the clever subversive charm of \"Gee, Officer Krupke, krup you!\""},

In our very obliqueness to one another, an unexpected intimacy is born.The individual voice is the communal voice.The regional voice is the universal voice.I do believe that, too.  I see that it has been true in literary history, and I feel it in my heart.  I note the irony that some writers and readers tout the virtues of locally grown food but sometimes ignore or neglect the local or regional voice.  But a Winesburg, Ohio will always speak to someone at the right time in hir life!  (hir = the neutral-gendered \"her\" or \"his\" I just learned!)I also believe that patience and persistence can see a writer through the long meandering process of finding a voice and living the writer's life.  I am honored to have my take on this featured in Her Circle Ezine at the moment, here another circle of women quietly, patiently, persistently supporting one another.The Bronte writing women were all three bookish sisters!  And for a humorous excellent television version, see Modern Family, in which there's a bookish sister and a popular sister, and almost never the twain shall meet, except in love and fierce family loyalty and instructions involving how to talk on a cell phone.  (I see it on hulu.)  Alice James was a bookish sister in a bookish family!  And her book is her diary.Next, my women's book group will be reading Loving Frank, by Nancy Horan, related by marriage to someone in my local wine-drinking circle of women.  Loving Frank, which I read when it first came out in 2007, and look forward to re-reading, as re-reading is what made The Used World astoundingly lovely to me, is a fictionalized account of the real relationship between Frank Lloyd Wright and Mamah Borthwick Cheney, seen by some as scandalous, by others as unconventional.  I don't send you to Wikipedia for her as that will spoil the suspense of the novel!  Actually, so will the Frank Lloyd Wright article, if you read it all, so don't read the midlife controversy part if you don't know it already!And now let me send you to further delight.  The strawberry painting is by J. Bernard Kroch, who has given me permission to use his work. Here is his new website if you want to see more, or buy one of his spectacular small paintings!!And here is the new Richard Jones poetry feature at Escape Into Life! You can find more great poetry features--Sarah J. Sloat, Nin Andrews, Susan Rich, Kelli Russell Agodon, Diane Lockward, Jannett Highfill, etc., etc.!--on the Poetry page.  And also, me, from before I was poetry editor!! I like being a bookish sister."},

A number of customers blew in and out, one twice: a charming young man thrilled to purchase Shelby Foote's trilogy on the Civil War....for his dad's upcoming 60th birthday, until he called his mom and realized his dad would only want hardbacks, new.  But he'll be back for more for himself, as we just got a lot of Civil War books, and he is particularly interested in Stonewall Jackson.Carrie is reading RubyFruit Jungle, by Rita Mae Brown, because she loves that book, had always wanted a copy, and found one at Babbitt's.  Thanks to Wikipedia, I finally know what that means.  Why am I always the last to know?  In the random coincidence zone, the mother in the novel is named Carrie, but she is not a likable character, I gather, and Carrie the reader probably is.  She was very cheerful when I chatted with her.In the wind event zone, I am tickled to share again with you \"Wind Disorder,\" a poem by Ron Hardy read by Nic Sebastian at Whale Sound; you can hear it here in her wonderful voice, with just the right amount of slightly eerie wind disorder in it.  Whale Sound is always clickable in the blogroll on the right, and there are new offerings daily.An amazing variety of clouds flew past the picture window all day long at Babbitt's--white heaps on pure blue, dark gray flannel blankets, blankets with white lace.And now I am off to my book group, and will report on that, and more, in this blog tomorrow."},

Otherwise, the guy would have bought it, and I know he will seek it out, because he was very intrigued by reading around in it.Here's what the author said about it:  A surreal semi-autobiographical blackbook record of a semi-mad period of my life, in that mindless, timeless state most romantics pass through, confusing flesh madonnas with spiritual ones.  (According to Amazon.com.)  Know who and what it is?Yes, Her, by Lawrence Ferlenghetti. It's $40 because it is a first edition hardcover copy in very good condition, with its dustjacket also in very good condition. I'm glad that he'll be able to find it at Amazon in paperback as cheap as $5, new, and $1.83 used, and see that it would have been a good deal at $40, since the only hardcover offered in the Marketplace at the moment is $137. But it's signed.And Lawrence Ferlinghetti would probably be happy about the cheap paperback, too, as he co-founded City Lights Books for softcover books! We checked our paperback fiction shelves at Babbitt's, and even the poetry shelves (just in case) for a softcover edition. But I think A Coney Island of the Mind was somewhere in the stacks on the floor.Another sweet conversation was with a very young girl who likes very old books. She has some at home.  Her dad says our bookstore looks like his house, with full shelves and piles on the floor that make it hard to get to the shelves.  I was glad I had explained the trade policy to his daughter. They might be able to bring in more than they take back out, reducing their floor clutter....and adding to ours. Uh oh.And, indeed, some of today's conversations with were people who brought in bags of books and who will be back once somebody has a chance to look at them.  I got only a tiny stack done because on Sundays I teach my little poetry class in the rare book room.And that's how I got a copy of New Scriptor, published at Adlai E. Stevenson High School in Lincolnshire, Illinois as \"A Forum for Illinois Educators.\"  (I will peruse it and return it to the group, to be passed around among educators, next week!)  According to the inside rear cover, \"Any Illinois educator may submit ficiton [sic], poetry, drama, art, and expository writing.\"  Typographical error in the guidelines notwithstanding, this issue does contain poems by Martha Modeana Vertreace-Doody, well-known Illinois poet and educator.Gosh, I better not make any typos in this blog entry!  Oh, wait, it's a blog entry.  I can relax!Anyhoo, you can get more info about the journal here.And numerous conversations today were actually about Babette, of Babette's Books.  (That would be the very cute kitty you see here, who now lives in the bookstore.)"},
{"title": "Write Your Heart Out", "date": "Saturday, October 23, 2010", "text": "Day 257...and Candace has been reading The Faith of a Writer: Life, Craft, Art, by Joyce Carol Oates, because she is a writer herself, of fiction and poetry, and this is a book that helps you have faith in yourself as a writer.  She wanted me to read it, so I am, and it's such fine clear writing in several short--some very short--essays written for various purposes and published elsewhere, here gathered.For example, I have already read \"To a Young Writer,\" which begins and ends Write your heart out, because it appears in Letters to a Young Writer, edited by Frederick Busch, and I enjoyed that book.  Loved reading Oates again, because Write your heart out is good advice.  If you've got a heart, and you're a writer, what else are you going to do?There's some repetition in the book--of childhood stories or locales, of favorite books, like Alice in Wonderland--but that's OK.  It ties things together, and this is a quick read.  I loved \"Notes on Failure,\" because, yes, failure or just \"not making it\" in the eyes of the current culture or marketplace, so often deepens us, as writers or any kind of artist, and frees us to do what we do in our own way, anyway.I'm halfway through the book and feel that Joyce Carol Oates is the Barbra Streisand of writing, in versatility, perfect pitch, and pure, clear voice.  Also they share some sensitivity and honesty.  I recall that Barbra Streisand had severe stage fright for a time, preventing her from doing live shows, and the \"Notes on Failure\" chapter applies here.  Also, these two women share perfectionism, I sense, or intense devotion to their art.I was reading it between matches and during warm-ups at the Big 12 Junior Varsity tournament today, where other people were reading, too!  A coach was reading a mass market paperback mystery.  Parent spectators were reading hardbacks, library books, trade paperbacks.  One was 1776 by David McCullough.And one of the players, the one who writes poetry, was reading while lying in a heap with her teammates, resting after eating during the long break.  I'm not sure, but it might have been The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn."},
{"title": "Blind Assassin", "date": "Friday, October 22, 2010", "text": "Day 256 of the \"What are you reading, and why?\" project, and a young woman will be reading or re-reading a stack of bestsellers that includes The Blind Assassin, by Margaret Atwood, The Hours, by Michael Cunningham,  The Secret Life of Bees, by Sue Monk Kidd, and The Shadow of the Wind, by Carlos Ruiz Zafon, and here's why:1) She is going on a long trip and will have hours to read!2) She is working on an assignment to examine issues of appearance, specifically dress and behavior, in a recent bestseller.What a great assignment!  Now I want to read or re-read a novel with that in mind.  She was particularly excited about The Blind Assassin, an Atwood novel she hadn't read yet, which she found next to The Handmaid's Tale, the one she had asked about. (I had just placed them side by side on the floor, where they tend not to be an alphabetical order.  They are [supposed to be] in alphabetical order on the shelves, and are sometimes in alphabetical order on the floor, our overflow spot, but not always.)She hadn't read or seen the film of The Hours, which I had recently watched (half of), so I alerted her that the three main female characters are explored in three different time periods, so behavior, dress, and \"appearance\" in multiple meanings of that word are intensely present in that novel.She had read and remembered The Secret Life of Bees, and was excited to compare child and adult, black and white cultures, and matters of \"appearance\" in that novel.And I said, \"Oh, I have been wanting to read The Shadow of the Wind,\" and her friend sweetly showed me that we have another copy of it there at Babbitt's on the Select New Arrivals shelf!While the cover art and content of Reading Lolita in Tehran, by Azar Nafisi, directly address issues of clothing, behavior, and appearance, it is indeed a memoir, and she must read a novel for this assignment."},
{"title": "To the End of the Land", "date": "Thursday, October 21, 2010", "text": "And to the bottom of the soulful coincidii....Kim has informed me that the NPR story she actually heard was about The End of the Land, by David Grossman, an Israeli activist, so here is his book and a link to an article about it.  You can read or listen; it's NPR!  With related articles here.It's a novel.And here it is at Amazon....and soulful coincidii, you might want to watch this wonderful 10-minute animation, which you will also be reading!  (You'll see.)  It's by Jeremy Rifkin, author of The Empathic Civilization: The Race to Global Consciousness in a World in Crisis.I recommend also cell biologist Lynn Margulis, who says we are like this down at the cell level--and she's the co-author of Mystery Dance, with her son Dorion Sagan, mentioned earlier in this blog.And to Richard Rorty (R.I.P.), a wonderful philosopher sociologist.And, of course, back to Living Downstream, by Sandra Steingraber, and the new documentary film based on the book.You can find all these things on your own, and this is a much shorter entry, eh?!  Many thanks to Bill Harrison, who posted the youtube link at Facebook!Day 255 of the \"What are you reading, and why?\" project, and this will be a random linking up of yesterday's soulful coincidii, with a glancing reference to this book, Crossing the River: A Memoir of the American Left, the Cold War, and Life in East Germany, by Victor Grossman, which someone must be reading, because NPR replayed yesterday evening in our area, and this morning, on the website, a five-minute interview with Grossman on his 2003 book, in their Americans Abroad series.Victor Grossman is an interesting man, an American soldier who left the army, swam the Danube, and lived in East Germany, getting a new perspective on the events of World War II and its aftermath, and at the end of the NPR interview you can hear his criticism of the current religious-political agendas that continue to stand in the way of world peace and, his concern, a world without poverty, which is, to him, I gather, primarily a social justice issue. This must be the part of the interview my friend Kim heard, driving to the interfaith panel last night at New Covenant Community in the Campus Religious Center in Normal, Illinois, where a packed room listened to the kind, honest, generous, thoughtful conversation of 3 people of different faith traditions--Islam, Judaism, and Christianity--all descendants of the Abrahamic tradition.What an amazing and beautiful evening that was!  Such vision, such generosity of spirit!  I learned so much, and, of course, the Muslim man was Pakistani!  (See yesterday's colorful coincidence!)Kim mentioned the interview and book to me because I mentioned to her a brief conversation with my husband, before leaving the house, in which 1) I invited him to come to the panel discussion because 2) he mentioned Noam Chomsky in connection with South Africa and Israel, and how we, the United States, might be at the same juncture now with Israel that we were with South Africa, as the only country standing by at the last minute, before real change...I will let you put that together on your own.  But Jimmy Carter was the President who finally said, \"No,\" and South Africa, through long hard work and suffering, and with the long patience of Nelson Mandela, achieved its change with and without us (U.S.).The interfaith panel, arranged by New Covenant pastor Susan Ryder, and moderated by retired Presbyterian minister Dick Watts (a co-writer with John Dominic Crossen of this book, Who is Jesus? Answers to Your Questions About the Historical Jesus), came about in response to the negative press and reactions to the building of a community center and mosque (I am using the terms from last night) near the site of the World Trade Center.  (You will recall the very public threats of Koran burning and the Florida pastor [who has now won a car?!], and, as I learned last night, there was a private back yard burning of the Islamic holy book by someone somewhere.)  Our local Christian and Jewish faith groups stood vigil at the Islamic center right after the 9/11 attacks, a difficult time for everyone, and this interfaith panel emerged as a similar show of moral support as well as an educational opportunity, and the packed house and compassion in the room make me think it worked well.What I learned last night will also send me to some books by Karen Armstrong that I've not yet read: A Short History of Islam, Muhammad: A Prophet of Our Time, and  A History of God: The 4,000 Quest of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. (You can find them all at Amazon, but here is a link to the book pictured.)  You can imagine some of the opposition Armstrong faced when some of her books, or new editions of them, came out in 2002 and in the 9/11 terror and aftermath.  But she is the founder of the Charter for Compassion.This is such a delicate topic, and it's true that life is easier if we avoid talking about religion and politics, at least at dinner parties (or potlucks), but this is a conversation that needs to happen and happened last night in loving and compassionate, reasonable and honest ways.  And I hope we keep 1) talking and, of course, 2) reading!!And lest you be a secular humanist or an atheist, you were represented lovingly, too, though not on the Abrahamic panel.  Moderator Dick Watts reminded us of the recent religion quiz (Internet-based) and that the highest scorers were atheists, and speaker Dave Hirst mentioned his secular humanist friend who asked, \"Why isn't there a secular humanist on your panel?\"  That can be a conversation to come!And if you like drama, and I mean theatre, you might want to read Via Dolorosa, written and performed by playwright David Hare.  (I have seen a filmed version of him performing his one-man play based on a visit to the State of Israel, when both he and Israel turned 50.  Talk about a midlife crisis!)And if you like quirky but amazing, thoughtful movies like Wings of Desire, Adaptation, and Being John Malkovich, you might like Cold Souls, starring Paul Giamatti as himself, which ultimately shows another way of learning compassion.  I watched it with my friend Kim on Tuesday night and with my husband last night, upon returning home from the interfaith panel (OK, I watched half of it before falling asleep and woke up at the end), but it was my second viewing that enlightened me to this: actors are indeed mules of the soul, bearing many in the course of their work, and that is why we sometimes break down and sometimes don't know exactly who we are: Christian, atheist, secular humanist, hollow body?Forgive me the long entry.  Thank you for bearing with me."},

My parents must be reading the new Granta, because it came in the mail a couple days ago.  The beautiful colorful cover to the Pakistan issue reminds me of a wonderful summer day several years ago when a young man walked onto our grassy volleyball court one Saturday afternoon, joining our motley crew of actors, artists, and dubious athletes in a friendly regular pickup game.  We invited him to the evening barbecue potluck, gave him address and directions, and he came, bringing the 3-hour video to his recent wedding in Pakistan.And he put it in the VCR and invited us all to watch it!He was so sweet, so excited, and so friendly.  As it was my home, I spent as much time as I could watching, and asking questions, and smiling and praising, and then I would wander to the kitchen at the back of the house, tending to people, on out the back door to the grill, et cetera.  I do think the video was on for all three hours of the party....And people would wander in and out politely chatting and watching a few moments of the professionally filmed wedding video, bringing him food and drink.  It all worked out."},

Anyhoo, I am enjoying some books passed along to me by co-workers, one borrowed, to be returned to our reference shelf at the bookstore, and one a gift: Writing Illinois: The Prairie, Lincoln, and Chicago, by James Hurt, a scholar and English professor who, alas, died just this past June.  This is a work of literary criticism and historical inquiry that I will place next to Lincoln's Favorite Poets (picked up in a vintage bookshop in Ohio) on my special Lincoln shelf at home.Aauugghh, both are first editions!  Must get mylar jackets!  This I have learned from Book Finds, by Ian C. Ellis, and from working at Babbitt's for three years.  But I wasn't working there when I put my address label on the front free endpaper of Lincoln's Favorite Poets, by David J. Harkness and R. Gerald McMurtry.  Sigh....  On the other hand, these are books I want to keep and read, not resell.I have a jillion books.  Someday some of them may be very valuable, so my home library may turn out to be the legacy and inheritance I leave my children, who are quietly laughing behind their hands at me much of the time, because I am a poet.  No, really, my kids are sweet about all that, but they know I will never be rich and famous.  I love coming across phrases like \"much ignored\" in Book Finds, applying to writers now immortal because their work stood the test of time and their first editions are very valuable, et cetera, because then there is hope for the \"much ignored\" me! Because I am a great reader, and love to discuss books \"shared inquiry\" style, and because I have read How to Read a Book, by Mortimer J. Adler, I do indeed underline and write marginalia in many of my books!  But, now that I know better, not in any more first editions or advance reader copies.  This is my legacy, kids!Another thing I love about Book Finds is that I can identify things about it!  It is the first printing of the Updated 3rd Edition, which does not increase its value one whit because it is a remaindered trade paperback, with a black remainder mark in the spine corner of the bottom textblock edge, and full of Sarah's pen notes.  I am reading all the chapters, including the ones that say, \"Skip\" beside the chapter title!  It is a book that must frequently be updated, as prices and trends change, and the specific examples must change even if the core information holds true.  And it has some typographical and proofreading errors!Which reminds me!  I got to handle a Louisa May Alcott first edition yesterday, with a typographical error in it--a repetition of the word \"at--or a \"point\" that distinguishes it from other states and editions of the book.So, Sarah, when you are a famous bookstore owner, like Sylvia Beach of Shakespeare and Company in Paris, your pen notes are going to make that little remaindered trade paperback very, very valuable!And, if I keep at it, I may leave a legacy in books, if not in poetry.  But I'm still committed to the poetry, \"much ignored\" as it is!Please visit the blog of Bill Radawec, and see his art and read accounts of his work and exhibits.  You'll want to read about the Slightly Altered show, the John Lloyd Wright, son of Frank Lloyd Wright connection, and all about Lincoln Logs.  This is his log cabin."},

Anyhoo, we might have to pull Old Possum's Books of Practical Cats off the Poetry Cart...And, in the land of coincidii, of course today I handled a cartoon book by Beverly Guhl called Cats are Better than Men.  Beverly was pretty convincing.Oh!  The guy who wanted Paul Auster last week turned up as a waiter at the local organic foods brunch before Living Downstream.  The film is amazing.  I urge you to see it if it comes to your town and to seek it out if it does not.  An educational DVD is available now, and some of us hope to get this into the local schools, to build awareness.  It would go along with the healthy food information my daughter is already getting in her consumer science and physical education classes, and it would counter some of the status-quo information coming out in agriculture courses.  But Steingraber comes from farmland, her cousin is farmer, three of the speakers after the film were organic farmers.  She is not opposed to agriculture!  She is opposed to poisonous pesticides that harm us, our earth, our air, and our water.I was very moved by the scenes in which Rachel Carson, of Silent Spring, testified before Congress, making this a human rights issue.  We have a right to a clean environment and not to be poisoned in our own homes, in the midst of our lives, she said.  And Sandra Steingraber is carrying on that human rights fight.  \"Never give up,\" she wrote in our books."},

It is an epistolary and autobiographical novel, although Goethe himself survived.  The book made him very famous, everybody loved and read it, the author later distanced himself from it, and that'll teach you to write about unrequited love and to write to your beloved and ask for pistols.  That is, don't! Oh, gentle young man, maybe have the satirical Joys of Young Werther, by Friedrich Nicolai, on hand as an antidote.Or Emma, by Jane Austen, about a sort of clueless matchmaker.  (Hence, Clueless, the film with Alicia Silverstone.)  And possibly an inspiration for The Matchmaker, by Thornton Wilder, revised from his own earlier version, The Merchant of Yonkers, with The Matchmaker then leading to Hello, Dolly, which I watched half of last night before falling asleep.Then I woke up and attempted a little crazy middle-aged matchmaking in the fantasyland of my own clueless head.  And by email.  Please, please forgive me.  If you do, I promise not to turn my life into an epistolary musical."},

And that's where I found her as I approached.  We had a lovely chat, and I was able to show her where the actual bodies lie, Adlai next to his father and mother, his grandfather, the Vice President, set apart under a big monument.  You can see the monuments here, though the sidewalk is newer now, the flagpole out by the street path.This woman, who is 80, had voted for Stevenson when he was presidential candidate, twice, and was sorry that we don't have people like him in politics anymore.  She is convinced that money runs things now, and people vote to hold onto their personal money.  Sounds about right.But I see things changing, finally, gradually, some.And then, just before I left today, I had such a nice talk with a man in a motorized wheelchair, chugging over to see a pile of walnuts.  He lives next to the cemetery, harvests the nuts, and sells them at a local farmer's market!  We talked about the big commercial walnut place in Missouri, about how walnut hulls stain the skin, and all sorts of things.  His wife is buried in the mausoleum, only a few feet away from his house, but he has a new wife now.  People are beautiful!Well, for instance, here's Nicole Kidman, and the United Nations flag:"},

It's just like what Jiminy Cricket sings in \"When You Wish Upon a Star.\"And speaking of songs, a book I handled today was Lyrics by Oscar Hammerstein II, with a preface by Richard Rodgers.  Just the lyrics, to many songs from musicals.  I fell in love with that book, wrote down the lines I always forget from \"Out of My Dreams\" from Oklahoma, and now I will be singing that to warm up for the last weekend of the cemetery walk tomorrow.....Link to list of Nobel Prize Winners in Literature here.  (Thanks to S.

(You'll see that Wikipedia is already up to date on this, and will probably be altering the article rapidly as new info comes out.)Yesterday's winners in chemistry, for their work with palladium, put me in mind of Palladium, this book of poems by Alice Fulton, with its gorgeous palladium print by Ellen Foscue Johnson, \"Woman in the Grass.\"I loved the NPR story yesterday, on the chemistry winners, when the Morning Edition host Steven Inkskeep said, \"You lost me at 'palladium,'\" and expert Joe Palco went back to define it.Inskeep was thinking of the theatre definition, but Palco was speaking of the metal, used mostly as a catalyst. That is the definition that serves in the first section of Fulton's Palladium, followed by poems that, in some way, riff off that.  And then she provides the other definitions, section by section, including the one about theatres and music halls.Palladium process returns to the chemical definition and a print process in photography that produces beautiful rich blacks, and a precision and mystery, as in the black and white photo on the cover of the poetry book you see here. Other definitions are mythological.  Athena made a palladium, a kind of talisman in honor of her friend Pallas, whom she accidentally killed.  Athena's palladium is associated with a cult object, the kind that fell from the sky in Troy, meaning safety, later called palta and connected with meteorites.  We always want to turn the scary thing--a sudden hot rock falling from the heavens--into something that insures our safety, don't we?And, generally, the Nobel Prize secures the safety of a reputation, and honors a body of fine and valuable work.  But I definitely want to know more about this \"literary feud\"!!  Why did Vargas Llosa punch his friend Gabriel Garcia Marquez in the nose?!  Garcia Marquez is a Nobel Prize winner, too, from 1982, but the nose-punching incident was in 1976....still, professional rivalry, jealousy, or some personal issue?  Eh, Wikipedia...?!"},

But I learned this when I asked Stephanie, who is a museum intern and tour guide at the cemetery with me these days, \"Is your boyfriend reading J. G. Ballard?\"\"Yes!\" she said, \"Neuromancer!\"  Then we had a conversation about Atrocity Exhibition, by J. G. Ballard.So we are both a bit confused.  (I'm sure Stephanie's boyfriend will set us straight.  Or set me straight, the next time he is in Babbitt's.)Anyway, Neuromancer won the 3 biggies of science fiction, the Nebula Award, the Phillip K. Dick Award, and the Hugo Award.  I'm sure it's a wonderful novel.But as I continue in The Common Review, I am reading \"Like Pain to a Knife: Reading J. G. Ballard's Fiction,\" by Paul Youngquist.  I have got to read some Ballard, as we both grew up during the violence of the 60s (race troubles, assassinations, war), having our childhood innocence spattered with civil blood, even as we continued on in a fairly sheltered existence.  As the violence, and its commercialization and regularity continued, the world changed around us, like a shattered windshield nobody ever fixed.As Paul Youngquist explains it, Ballard went ahead and turned the psyche inside out in his fiction, since all that supposedly repressed stuff was clearly out there already.  And Youngquist himself could identify with that.  He says, \"It's not me who needs a shrink.  It's the world.\"I love the boldness of that.  Yes, the world is screwed up.  If you have a bit of borderline depression or generalized anxiety disorder, and Youngquist says he does, isn't that the most appropriate reaction to a world in which human life is valued very little, violence is commonplace, and no one really wants to fix things? Oh...yes, that's always been the dark side of reality.And the world could get blown up in a moment?  We have nuclear war."},

I was telling the radio interviewer how each year, to write the script, I read all the research and then wait for what comes back, what I remember about that real person's life, not necessarily the public history nor the readily-available facts.  This way, we all get to know the person buried there.Today I found a letter in the mail from a stranger who had attended the walk on the weekend.  What a sweet thing.  He had gotten to know Helen Davis Stevenson, mother of Adlai the governor, later appointed to the United Nations by President John F. Kennedy.  She died before all his accomplishments, but she helped make him a great man.And to see the sweet faces of children...ah!Well.  I am exhausted because we do this 16 times a day on the weekends, and 24 times a day on the weekdays.  Whew!  But they feed us.When I get home, I am too tired to read anything but magazine articles, and then, to make sure I fall asleep, I watch half a movie.  Last night it was Mrs. Parker, and the Vicious Circle, because 1) it is long 2) it has a lousy soundtrack 3) people talk at the same time and 4) I am in love with Campbell Scott.  Oops.  That doesn't put me to sleep, but the other stuff does.  Anyhoo....It's possible that we are all mysteries to each other, yes, but we aren't trashy.  This cemetery walk was begun, in part, to reduce vandalism in the cemetery, and it has worked.  People love it, schools love it (and Illinois history is part of the curriculum), and we learn to value one another.  Yes, let us value one another.  Alive and dead."},

Yes, I am still reading the current issue of The Common Review, and this is in his article \"Samuel Butler's Willful Machines: The Lost Wisdom of Erewhon,\" but I started reading it without paying attention to the author.  I loved the funny, personal style, and then got overly excited when he mentioned--calling it \"his nonclassic\"--The Books in  My Life, by Henry Miller.  Apparently Miller made 3 lists: Books You've Read, Books You Will Read, and Books You Will Never Read, and, frankly, that sounds like fun, but, as you know by now, my brain is slightly scrunched origami.Then the article mentioned philosophy, literary criticism, sheep farming in New Zealand (Butler's day job), and evolution, and I flipped back to find out who the author was.  Dorion Sagan!

I read it about 30 years ago but forgot most of it. The author, Robert Pirsig was a University Professor at U of Minnesota, I think, and doctoral candidate at University of Chicago when he was diagnosed as clinically insane in the early 60s. This book is the true story of his motorcycle trip with his son and two others about 6 years later. He tries to come to grips with his mental illness by describing the process by which he went insane - an intellectual process that takes the reader through a couple thousand years of philosophy. I think my son almost went insane by the end but he grappled with the issues pretty well for a 16 year old. Glad that book is over so I can start reading some Dean Koontz.....\"It's lovely when someone emails me about the book, because then I can quote him/her!  \"Yes, you can quote me,\" said Fred.I emailed back that I remembered the motorcycles and the philosophy but had completely forgotten the insanity.\"The insanity is the major point of the story. Pirsig went insane trying to develop a philosophy that could encompass both Classical and Romantic views (according to his definition of them). As he talks about this struggle during the book you see that he is starting to show signs of going insane again. At the end you aren't sure if he has turned back into his former self (and gone insane) or has merely incorporated that self into his current personality (and is therefore more whole than he ever was). \"Fred was very patient with me.  I see from the Wikipedia article that Pirsig was purposefully alluding to Zen in the Art of Archery, by Eugen Herrigel, a book I loved.  (It is not, I think, about insanity.  It is about learning not to focus on the goal/target/one's desire to hit it but instead to learn how to use the bow and arrow, and to focus on that in each moment, and rather literally let go of the arrow, gently, with beautiful form.)Today I got a call at work from a woman, a stranger to me, who heard my poem on Poetry Radio today, \"A House in Carlock.\"  She said it gave her goosebumps.  I was so honored and thrilled. Then another woman called with a research question, who had heard me on the radio in an interview about the cemetery walk!  So a lot of people heard me on the radio today!  But I was at work, so I missed me.Which is very Zen of me, perhaps.  And slightly insane."},

Erhman.  OK, I don’t know if anyone is actually reading this particular book, the one I handled at Babbitt’s on Monday, but I was reading the first few pages of it to figure out who he was.  Guess who Max Erhman was?!  The guy who wrote that prose poem “Desiderata” that is everywhere!  For instance, you can click here for it!He wrote it back in 1927 or so, it circulated among soldiers, it went out in his Christmas greetings, it caught on gradually, was attributed wrongly to others and to another era, as you can read here, and then, in 1965, guess who made it famous and popular again?!Adlai Stevenson!  By dying.  Apparently, Adlai Stevenson was also going to send out “Desiderata,” which means “things to be desired,” in his Christmas card that year!  As I have mentioned here, I will be playing Adlai Stevenson’s mother, Helen Davis Stevenson, in Evergreen Cemetery in October.  Looking over at his grave.  And mine.And guess who rode his bicycle to Evergreen Cemetery for Adlai Stevenson’s funeral?  Carlos Eire!"},

Like Carlos Eire, Tony never saw his father again, and like Eire, Tony has lived in Miami, Chicago, and Bloomington-Normal.  I want these guys to meet!  I hope Tony will go to the Q&A at the Bloomington Public Library and say hola.Tony can't go to the evening event because, since moving to the Midwest, he's become a volleyball coach, and his Lady Ironmen are playing that night at the local high school.  From lizards and palm trees, to fall leaves and pom pons.What next?  Learning to Die in Miami, which comes out in November."},

After she reads it, she might enjoy the film, with Swedish actor (and lush) Warner Oland as Inspector Chan.  I was fascinated to read that the Charlie Chan character only became popular in movies after being played by a white actor.  Why should that surprise me?  It was 1931.  What really surprised and delighted me was that the character was played by Asian actors in the first couple films!

We'll be selling the books at Babbitt's, and I'll be taking my poetry workshop to the showing of the film on Sunday afternoon, October 17.  She is a poet, and I've read her book of poems, Post-Diagnosis, as well as Having Faith, her book on pollutants in breast milk.  (Gave the latter to a midwife.)  Steingraber spent time at both universities here.I'm linking you to her books here, and the blue image is the movie poster, and it's on the little brochure I'm carrying around to remind me to get my ticket ($8) in advance at The Garlic Press.I read the edition published in 1997 a few years later when my brother sent me his copy, and will get the new one when it gets here.  In the wonderful-but-dangerously-polluted land of coincidii, she'll go from here to other places I've lived and also to San Francisco, near my brother.Here is the Illinois Screening Tour, which shows that she'll also play in Peoria, not far from Pekin (where she grew up and got bladder cancer at 22), Springfield, Champaign, and Chicago (where you can get your tickets at the fabulous Women and Children First bookstore).Here at her website, you can watch the trailer (as you can on the film page), listen to an interview, and see that she's also headed to Kansas, Maine, New York, and my alma mater, Kenyon College, in Gambier, Ohio.

Now Sideshow Bob really is wicked--he wants to kill Bart Simpson--and funny, as drawn by Matt Groening and played by Kelsey Grammer.But \"wicked funny\" seems to refer to sarcasm used to make fun of people, their flaws, and their work.  (One might even want to be wicked funny about Kelsey Grammer's life and recent woes, but, fear not, I am not going to link you to TMZ, and Wikipedia takes care of that, anyway.  Poor Frasier.)And \"origasm\" is a made up word meaning origami orgasm, as when the brain folds get so intense your hair corkscrews out the side of your head.Last night, for example, watching Woman in Mind, the play by Alan Ayckbourn, I heard Gerald, a not-so-sympathetic-till-you-get-to-empathize-with-him character, played sympathetically by Todd Wineburner, say something about sarcasm being the last defense of the mediocre mind.  That's not it, but Julie will correct me.  And there are many excellent quotations for and against sarcasm, some of them sarcastic!  Anyhoo....1) I have indeed noticed sarcasm used to easily dismiss writers, especially threateningly successful or popular writers who have worked very hard...2)  Being wicked funny is a way to get your own work read, or maybe that's just me being frankly cynical...3) I am backing further and further away from sarcasm...because Sideshow Bob has a knife.Meanwhile, the way-above-sarcasm-mentioned David just finished Hunger, by Knut Hamsun, and is reading a poetry book by C.

The controversy has generated a lot of interest in what was chosen as a good \"community read\" in the first place, but opposed by some parents and students who were offended by its \"true diary\" content, the life of a teenage boy.Learned all this thanks to the New Pages blog link to this news article in the Springfield, MO News-Leader (which, alas, has ads).So, while some people are not reading the book, it has turned out to be a community read, after all.Reminds me of all the banned books my students looked into for a research paper assignment and how interested they got in what was banned, or proposed for banning, and why.  Reminds me that one of them was Johnny Got His Gun, by Dalton Trumbo, which we hardly ever have at Babbitt's, because of its persistent popularity, but which I put on the Selected New Arrivals shelf by the door this week.Meanwhile, that pastor in Gainesville, Florida (one of my hometowns, the one with the alligators) has vowed never to burn the Koran, thank goodness.  He's flown to New York, and perhaps that is a good place for him to be on this particular day.Let us hope someone, this sad, fine day, is reading Fahrenheit 451, by Ray Bradbury.  (I've linked to a large print edition because Pastor Jones appears to be an older man, who might prefer it.)And let us hope someone is reading some O. Henry today, his birthday.  To circle back round to the public schools, I read \"The Gift of the Magi\" with my daughter for her English class last year.  She likes to read it herself and then, as a way to study it, have me read it aloud to her, so, as I said way back when I started this what-are-we-reading-and-why project, another area of the brain is stimulated.  Eyes stimulate one main area, ears another....And O. Henry allows us to circle back to irony, the opening irony here, the central ironies of our lives, our ongoing community read.P.S.

{"title": "A Rather Elaborate Kimono", "date": "Friday, September 10, 2010", "text": "Day 214 of the \"What are you reading, and why?\" project, and Michael, who was taking my measurements in the cemetery, told me he was reading a book called The Trouble with Life is Someday You Die, but I could not find that book by Googling, so perhaps he was reading How We Live and Why We Die, by Lewis Wolpert, subtitled The Secret Lives of Cells.Anybody can correct me if I'm wrong!  Michael described the book as full of \"factoids\" about life that show how we are going along, since the moment we are born, programmed to die.  One of the freakiest factoids is that, with medical advances and stem cell research, it's possible there are people alive today who will still be alive in 400 years!Michael doesn't want to be here to see that.  And probably won't be.Why, you might ask, was a man taking your measurements in a cemetery?Well, I might answer, this year for the annual cemetery walk in Evergreen Cemetery, Bloomington, Illinois, where Dorothy Gage (the Dorothy Gale of The Wizard of Oz) and Old Hoss Radbourn (of Fifty-Nine in '84) are buried, along with the Adlai Stevenson family, I will be playing Helen Davis Stevenson, Adlai's mom, and Michael is the costumer as well as an actor this year.  In the Wonderful Land of CoincidOz, I see that a movie might be in the works based on the book by Ed Achorn, subtitled Old Hoss Radbourn, Barehanded Baseball, and the Greatest Season a Pitcher Ever Had, mentioned earlier in this book blog!Additional coincidii: the name \"Lewis,\" as Helen Davis married Lewis Stevenson, who was always \"on the wing,\" off taking the cure.  There is a picture of Lewis Stevenson in a rather elaborate kimono that suggests a few things about that marriage.Wikipedia tells me that Adlai Stevenson is referenced in two episodes of The Simpsons, \"Lisa the Iconoclast\" (the one about the real Jebediah Springfield) and \"The Secret War of Lisa Simpson\" (the one about hazing at military school) and Adlai Stevenson II is indeed just the kind of witty intelligent true statesman that Lisa would idolize.Adlai, known as \"Laddie\" by his mom, acted in plays in school.  McLean Stevenson, the actor from M*A*S*H, whose character famously died in on his plane home from the Korean War to his beloved Bloomington, Illinois, is a cousin of the famous political family.There are more coincidii, but my brain is folding unto death...I will not be wearing a kimono.The kimono you see here--a detail of two cranes--is found in the Special Collections of the W. Frank Steely Library of Northern Kentucky University."},

My co-worker Sarah said she hoped he wasn't going to burn it.Another man walked out with A Good Scent from a Strange Mountain, by Robert Olen Butler, winner of the Pulitzer Prize.OMG, Robert Olen Butler is tweeting from Hell, and collecting books with inappropriate titles, like Invisible Dick!  Who knew?  Clearly, not me, not until today.I might have to create a new genre: invisible dick lit.A lot of Lincoln books came in, including Manhunt, by James L. Swanson, among the books I bought to put on reserve for my students when Abraham Lincoln was the general topic for the research paper that semester.Happily, a young woman found I Capture the Castle, by Dodie Smith, for a friend.  Dodie Smith, I always forget, wrote 101 Dalmatians!And somehow it seems appropriate that, finally, the white morning glories have begun to open, the ones called Pearly Gates.  I haven't seen a moonflower yet, also planted from seed this spring, but the white morning glory that opened today was open in the shade all afternoon."},

So now, of course, The Winter Sun, a memoir, subtitled Notes on a Vocation, is on my wishlist.Pause to digress, and fold brain:  I have a poem called \"Silver Sun,\" based on a painting by Arthur Dove, and published in an ekphrastic magazine called Beauty/Truth, which, with its editor, suddenly dropped off the edge of the earth.  I worry about that guy.I have a poem called \"Virga,\" and so does Diane Lockward, in her book, What Feeds Us.  They are completely different--hers is about the virga of snow, mine about the virga of rain--and this kind of coincidence, of title and topic in poems, happens frequently, no cause for alarm, only for astonishment, joy, and brain-folding.I missed church on Sunday, staying home with my family, my son home from college for the Labor Day weekend, then going off to work, seeing the man on the bicycle who wants to read Franzen, etc., but I read the reflection later online, so I know Susan was reading A Life at Work: The Joy of Discovering What You Were Born To Do, by Thomas Moore, a book that has been on my wishlist so long I finally took it off, figuring I'd get it at the library.Notice how the subtitle folds the brain back to Fanny Howe...And on the morning drive to the high school (deprived of school bus, thanks to redistricting, though one reason we moved here to central Illinois was safe, free public education and free school transportation with non-drug-using-non-drug-dealer-non-pimp school bus drivers) I pondered, in addition to opium-financed terrorism (NPR story on NATO), the fact that Helen Degen Cohen's chapbook, On a Good Day One Discovers Another Poet, is entirely about what she is reading--poetry, mainly, but also film--an intertextual, brain-folding, saddle-stapled work.I don't think I ever stopped digressing, so now that I've got my panties brain in a bunch, it's time to return to the ongoing euphoria of blue morning glories in my own backyard."},
{"title": "Hand Sewing Wild Oates", "date": "Tuesday, September 7, 2010", "text": "Day 211 of the \"What are you reading, and why?\" project, and Candace is reading a big stack of Joyce Carol Oates, perhaps the most wildly prolific writer ever!  Several in the stack were trade paperback size, a mix of literary fiction, short stories, etc., but one was a mass market paperback of Bellefleur, an example of her historical fiction.What an interesting writer, willing and able to try so many things.The same day Candace splurged on fiction, thanks to a coupon, Judy bought that Jonathan Franzen memoir, The Discomfort Zone.  Here is the New Times review, which finds it annoying.  But I think Judy was interested in reading about his relationship with his mother.That morning, Sunday, I'd seen the man who was looking for Franzen earlier in the week.  He was wearing his bicycle helmet and climbing back on his bike, presumably after breakfast at the coffeehouse, and a little too far ahead on a Sunday morning for me to call out, \"Hey!  I have a Jonathan Franzen book for you!\" but he'll come back, and we'll have another.And now to the hand sewing.  I sewed a torn seam on a beach chair, that low kind that sits on the sand.  It sat on the sand in the Gulf of Mexico when all the kids were little, and it sat on the sand in Michigan on the lake this summer, where the pebbles and a wild tide day got the better of it.  I repaired it with doubled-up cotton-coated polyester thread and a thick gray thread strong enough to mend a coat or a carpet.  It was so lovely to sew!And this beautiful Spool of Thread painting (already sold!) comes from the website A Small Painting, which artist Jonathan Bernard Koch is reconstructing.  So be sure to visit it and keep an eye out for the new site!"},
{"title": "Cradle to Cradle", "date": "Monday, September 6, 2010", "text": "Day 210 of the \"What are you reading, and why?\" project and my son is reading Cradle to Cradle for his design class in college because the teacher was wise enough to use the students' lab fees to provide this wonderful text.  Subtitled Remaking the Way We Make Things, it is a completely waterproof and highly durable book by William McDonough and Michael Braungart, an architect and a chemist who advocate making high quality products in safe ways and to eliminate harmful waste that comes not only from many production processes but also from some forms of \"recycling.\"My son's example is that making carpet from recycled plastic bags just makes a carpet that 1) involved toxins in its making and 2) will still end up undecomposable on a dump.  These guys advocate stuff like edible plastic bags, non-toxic materials, soil-based roofs, and designing \"eco-effective\" products from the start, not the \"down-cycling\" that is a re-use of eco-ineffective products.I am so glad that my son is getting this exposure to a kind of environmentally aware kind of industrial design as part of his education!  Seems to me the USA would surely benefit from a return to an ethic that respects the product, the worker, and the customer, and involve everyone in the making of something they can be proud of, reversing the current practices of making the cheap/disposable/designed-to-go-obsolete product that disrespects the worker and the customers and junks up the environment.  I hope we don't just \"go green\" in the pseudo-jump-on-the-bandwagon way that simply continues business as usual, which would just give us greed combined with \"feel good\" green labels.  We know better, but we don't always do better.  Sigh....Meanwhile, my daughter is also learning about food health issues, but when I recommend Michael Pollan's Omnivore's Dilemma, she rolls her eyes and says, \"Don't tell me to read about food!\"  Her brother laughs and says, \"You read about food all the time on the Internet!\"  Etc., etc.  They are both learning good stuff at school, in whatever ways they read, listen, learn, and think.And the rocking boat cradle is from Nerd Approved!"},

What the Heck! (Stuff to Talk About at Work When You Are Not Working).  (I am not at work, and I am not working.)So my brain is even further folded.Ron is reading The Brief History of the Dead, by Kevin Brockmeier, which sounds amazing (see his comment), and I know I will love Laura, a character who free associates even more than I do!Seana directed me to The Voices, by Suzanne Elderkin, which takes place in Australia, where the spirit world intersects with the tangible world perhaps more readily than here in the American Midwest, where I am taken by the wind....  Seana is great for international recommendations, so see her wonderful book blog, Not New For Long!And a character in The Used World, a novel by Haven Kimmel, is reading A Prayer for Owen Meany, by John Irving, out of which an important photograph falls.  I like this book except that I am having a hard time keeping track of all the characters, partly because I set the book aside so I wouldn't have one novel overlap another novel (The Cookbook Collector, by Allegra Goodman) before my book group meets to discuss it, but I am reading it early, anyway, because it is due back at the library, and partly because it folds back in forth in time, like origami, and like real life in various suspended states: alpha state between sleep and waking, death, dental procedures if you are given gas (and just happen to finish reading The French Lieutenant's Woman, by John Fowles, in your mind, giving it a few more variations.)"},

I love it when poems help me.  Stanza two begins, \"Another kind of man could turn into a tree,\" which is interesting in itself, and goes on, \"and still be a man,\" which did not exclude me even though I am a woman and also made me empathize with the speaker who is, evidently, not this kind of man...but maybe wishes he was, so he could \"take pleasure in the wind,\" something I did yesterday, \"in the water that flows up into his body,\" and, whoa! he is turning into a tree!, \"and out through his leaves like happiness\" (the title of the book!), \"refreshing/ that wind with its green life, that wind that travels everywhere,\" (and here tonight, writing, I recall that strange fact that we are breathing the same recirculating air of history, all over the world), \"poking its nose into root-crotch and grotto\" (ew!), \"calling who's there, who's there into the emptiness / and moving off quickly, before anything replies.\"And that was the part that helped me.  I could be 1) more like the wind, by 2) \"moving off quickly, before anything replies,\" and then 3) I wouldn't be troubled when nothing replies.But once I was the wind.  I had the visceral certainty of this, like memory.  I remembered being the wind.  Now that's a little freaky, and something I usually keep to myself, except for the poem I wrote about it, that I keep sending out.  Nobody wants to know you were once one of the four elements.  Sigh....  But once I met a perfectly sane, lovely, stable woman who knew it was time to pull back when she experienced being a river.  I'm sure there are reasons why I was the wind and she was the river.  Mine had to do with fatigue and hunger, evidently pretty common among people who see visions, et cetera.  But it was a wonderful feeling, amazing, pretty literally mind expanding.And not at all like volleyball."},

OK, I'll tell you why.  Thyroid vulnerability runs in my family, and is rampant in the Great Lakes region of the Midwest, where I grew up.  Put the two together and you get goiter, especially if sometime in the past a houseguest left a canister of uniodized salt in the house, and you and your family just used it as regular table salt, until stress on the body (childbirth) caused a little fever, then, and thyroid enlargement, later, together with a brief interlude of hypochondria induced by reading an outdated Merck Manual.Fear not!  1) We now have plenty of iodized sea salt; iodine is the prevention and cure for most of this kind of thyroid problem 2) I am already over my hypochondria 3) and, while I did look like a cross between Nikita Kruschev and Buddy Hackett as a baby, I was not, as my mother had at first feared, a cretin, which is a serious thyroid problem, and 4) I am still excessively happy, but I consider this a spiritual state.  Plus there is some really, really old iodine in the medicine cabinet.  If I have to, I'll drink it.Wait!  I have a topic?!  Oh, yes, books.Speaking of guilty pleasures*, I was eating/reading What Feeds Us, by Diane Lockward, at the rate of one chocolate/poem a day, and then I gorged on it and finished it today, while my computer was doing a full scan for whacked out thyroid problems.   It is a lovely book, full of beautiful food, funny and human moments, and a lost boy that keeps breaking my heart.  Plus fiery breasts.  There are bees on the covers, on peaches and sunflowers, and scary bees stinging people intermittently.Coincidii of the bees: 1) one is crawling down the throat of yesterday's morning glory 2) bees form a vestment in Sarah J. Sloat's poem \"Vestment,\" announced in her blog yesterday as being taped for Whale Sound, which you can find at the right on my blogroll.Coincidii of the blueberries: 1) when I resumed reading What Feeds Us today, it was with the poem \"Blueberry\"--Be a glutton and stuff in a handful, your tongue,/ lips, chin dyed blue, as if feasting on indigo--2) soon after reading about blueberries in Mythology and Milk.Wait!  Is that a mulberry rearing its annoying branch up through the morning glories?  Yes.  I hope they strangle it."},

{"title": "Textbook, Anyone?", "date": "Saturday, August 28, 2010", "text": "Day 201 of the \"What are you reading, and why?\" project, and college students all over the place are cracking open their textbooks and reading the first assignment in their basic texts in anthropology, art history, etc., etc.  Or still obtaining their texts, used or new.  Or otherwise handling the textbook racket.If you are a college student or have one as a kid, you know it's a racket.  If you write, edit, or publish textbooks, or if your ex-husband does, you know it's a racket.  Likewise, if you run a college bookstore.  I won't go on.Or I will only go on briefly, to mention the poetry racket.  I forgot to say, back when I was reading The Cookbook Collector, by Allegra Goodman, how I loved the character of the old poet--his annoying ego, his marvelous rebellion, and his declaration about cutthroat rivalry in that world.And a little further to say it may be so cutthroat because it's so hard to make a living if you write poetry.  You might have to give it up for a long time and do something else--sell insurance, manage a corporation, deliver babies, teach, or...stay a writer, but write children's books, which I think is what happened with Gary Soto, who wrote Junior College, a book of poems I found on a remainder table for $1.  Sigh.  He has written numerous other books for children and adults, but shifted toward young adult literature from poetry, I heard, in order to make a living.  I admire his dedication to reading and writing.  And I admire his poems!  I love the deep hole he digs, sweating, in \"Peach Pit,\" and how, eventually, it gets at poets' insecurities:My mother-in-law padded out in furry slippersAnd remarked, \"It's not deep enough,\"A line I have lived withSince I first sharpened a #2 pencil.And I love \"Rivers Inside the Blue Lines of Binder Paper,\" which begins:The English prof told us to draw our ideasAnd left the classroom feeling for the bottleOf peach brandy inside his coat.I love the coincidence of peach.Best wishes as you crack open textbooks and as you start back to school, teaching or learning. Best wishes at the beginning of the semester, as you try to find an affordable textbook, and at the end, as you try to sell it back.  I'm so glad students have found ways to sell and obtain used textbooks, sidestepping the racket.  Be careful out there."},
{"title": "The Stairway", "date": "Friday, August 27, 2010", "text": "Day 200 of the \"What are you reading, and why?\" project!  (165 to go.)  So far it's going well.  I love learning what people are reading, sharing little snippets of conversation with those of you reading this blog, and reading your comments.  (I would like a few more comments, just to know you are there, but I sense you are there, anyhoo, just like the people who appreciate the silver stairway in Stephen Dunn's poem, \"The Stairway,\" from The Insistence of Beauty.  So thank you.)Today will be a hodgepodge, and perhaps an odd one (because I am a bit of an odd one!)We have to read things at the right time, I think, and I am reading What Goes On, by Stephen Dunn, at the right time.  It's the right time for me because it is time to \"get serious,\" a little dream voice keeps telling me, which is something that can happen side by side with whimsy, thank goodness.  At some wrong moment in the past, I might have read Dunn's poems in which great writers exist in local habitations as a bit clever or glib, but I don't use those words to judge or dismiss anyone anymore, because they hurt when they were used that way on me.  Now I read these poems as quiet and deep, \"serious\" with a whimsical sheen.  Now I read them shortly after having read Dreamers of the Day, by Mary Doria Russell, that last chapter that returns us to the Nile, to some in-between state.  I read them after listening over and over to Patty Griffin singing \"Living with Ghosts.\" So now when I read poems titled \"Chekhov in Port Republic,\" \"Poe in Margate,\" \"Henry James in Cape May,\" \"Mary Shelley in Brigantine,\" and \"Melville at Barnegat Light,\" I go and live there, not just with the famous dead authors, but also with Stephen Dunn, who, like the alienated dead ones remembered and thus still alive, must also feel alone and apart in the world, by virtue of being a poet in it.  To quote Dunn:\"There goes Melville,\" the townspeople would say, proudthat a man whose books had been made into movieswalked among them.And I remember Scott Turow reading to a large crowd at the Newberry Library a lovely, literary, humane short story, and then giving the audience the opportunity to ask questions, and all the questions were about who would play the main characters in the movie of Presumed Innocent, and how do you get an agent?  What could he do but become a commodity?I remember Jean Baudrillard speaking to students at the Art Institute in Chicago.  \"Stop saying you are making art,\" he insisted.  \"You are making commodities.\"  They seemed, in their persistent theory-based and gallery-world questions not to get it.  Finally, he told them how to make art.  \"Go down to the river with a loaf of bread, a jug of wine, and somebody.\"  He meant, live.  Live first.  Love.  Get serious.So I know what Stephen Dunn is/was reading, to grow deep and whimsical: Chekhov, Poe, James, Shelley, and Melville.  I know what he was reading in an interview in 2000--that short story collection Women in Their Beds, by Gina Berriault.  I know that he doesn't remember what he was reading in this interview, at How a Poem Happens, about his poem \"And So,\" in the year he won his Pulitzer Prize.  I know my mother and I both read the poem \"The Routine Things Around the House\" in an anthology, and said, \"Wow. \"  And wow again.  So I'm glad he got to win a Pulitzer.  It's nice when wise, whimsical people do.But he's over 60.  And I'm over 50.  So if you are not yet over 30, it might not be the right time for you to read What Goes On.  You might have other things going on."},

She was fascinated, and didn't want to tell me too much about the gorilla aspect, so I would enjoy it when I got there, so I won't tell you too much, either.  But I will send you to the website, entirely copyrighted, so I won't even show you the gorilla reading a newspaper as an image here, and you can do the gorilla experiment on your own.  Best to click the video without reading the caption.There is even a sequel!Jan also finished Pillars of the Earth, by Ken Follett, recently, while on a trip.  There's a \"sequel\" to that, too, World Without End, which Jan mailed to herself because it was too heavy to carry home, at 1024 pages.She is a little annoyed with herself.  \"I went all the way to New York by train, and all the way to Maine by car, with my grandchildren, and all I can talk about is the two books I finished.\"She is also reading more W. H. Auden than she ever did before, because of many references to Auden in books by Alexander McCall Smith.  (I notice we got a couple Ladies No. 1 Detective Agency books in at Babbitt's this week.)  Jan doesn't much like Auden, or not as much as Smith does, anyway, but she does like \"Lullaby,\" the poem that begins, \"Lay your sleeping head, my love, / Human on my faithless arm,\" which kind of gets right at the human faithlessness at the heart of it all, as in many a poem by Edna St. Vincent Millay.  Or Dorothy Parker.  And the human love.And my niece walked into Babbitt's and found a copy of The Yellow Wallpaper, by Charlotte Perkins Gilman, which she will need for one of her first courses in graduate school in Boston, and which she left at home, which she could have gotten here, online, I suppose, and/or printed out, but she's like me and prefers books!  I was so glad we had it, as someone had just been in looking for it, and we were out, and it was even a slim paperback of just that story!  Often it is inside something else.Just like a gorilla."},

And a busy time is coming, too, so I was finishing up various books:I finished In the Next Galaxy, by Ruth Stone, which I have also written about here.  Poetry by a wise old woman.  Title sounds kind of scifi, but it isn't really, though alien things happen.  Even this title is a sort of poem: \"The Electric Fan and the Dead Man (or the widow as a useful object toward the end of the century).\"  And has alienation in it.  Plus this:What is imperative is the Off switch:which he, at one point some time ago,opted for himself.Tied a silk cord around his meat neckand hung his meat body, loved though it was,in order to insure absolute quiet,on the back of a rented door in Soho.But I also read much of A Civic Pageant, by Frank Montesonti, available at Black Lawrence Press, which made me laugh out loud in various kinds of delight.  \"Piranha\" is a good one to read before you start teaching your Creative Writing class this fall:Frank, do all our poems have to be about piranhas?a student asks--the piranha.No, no, not if you don't want them to be about piranhas,I tell her, of courseI really don't see the pointof not writing about piranhas......And then the poem has a fabulous climax, but you'll have to read the book to find it out!  I have to set it aside for a while, or all my new poems will be film voiceovers or somebody else's dreams, that is, Frank's.  And I need to go back and read or re-read the long poems, but I was thrilled that \"Film Noir\" appeared first in Poems & Plays, where I have also appeared.I laughed out loud at the epigraph to the poem \"John & Mary\" by Stephen Dunn, from What Goes On (New and Selected Poems 1995-2009):John & Mary had never met.  They were like two hummingbirds who also had never met.--from a freshman's short storyLikewise, on Creative Writing class.The other day Click & Clack, the brothers on Car Talk, were reading aloud that short story based on an in-class writing assignment to write a short story in tandem--you know the one, supposedly a real story, but probably made up, where a woman keeps trying to write a romance and a man keeps writing a scifi adventure, and pretty much they kill each other.  The Car Talk guys were discovering it and laughing in disbelief, and I almost wanted to call and say, \"You know, it's a fun assignment, that can produce some really creative stories that actually work, like the time you advised the guy to, sure, go ahead and use oatmeal to fix his radiator leak.\"  Which is a traditional fix, it turns out.Ah, Click & Clack.

We were discussing kudzu* at the time.  \"Mistletoe grows in big balls in the trees,\" said Jim.  \"They have to shoot it down.\"  According to National Geographic, this is quite true.  *Kudzu is considered an invasive pesky plant by many.  But I remembered reading somewhere about the beneficial uses of kudzu.  There is actually a documentary on kudzu!  Unfortunately, now it might be contributing to ozone pollution.  But if we could turn it into ethanol, we could have green gas!  Or it can treat cocaine addiction and alcoholism.  But at first the conversation was about kudzu technology, kudzu business ratings, etc., etc.  You see how this could just go on and on, like kudzu.I lived in Florida in childhood, so I did see it cover everything.  And I loved the Spanish moss, hanging from the trees.

Not having The Trial surprised us, and the boss will be checking the basement for duplicate copies, and bring them up tomorrow.  If I remind him.  (Google Alert might remind him, too, if I mention Babbitt's!)OK, but, here's the freaky coincidence.  BOTH of these men, who came into the store at different times, and who are not related to each other*, mentioned Baraboo, Wisconsin and a lovely used bookstore there, The Village Booksmith, run by Annie.*I asked, as returning college students and their parents have been walking around town this past weekend.My book life has also taught me that Baraboo is a circus town.In the afternoon, a completely different man, looking for Nancy Drew, mentioned that he is a little scared of people obsessed with the circus...And, to somehow complete some circle somewhere, I finished The Cookbook Collector, by Allegra Goodman, in which a rare bookstore features prominently, just in time to return Kim's copy of The Used World, by Haven Kimmel, about a used stuff shop, to the library and check it back out to myself.  Because she, too, came into the store today, but not at the same time as either Bariboo man, or the scared-of-the-circus man.I will pause to note another wee coincidence.  There is a lovely strand of mystic Judaism in The Cookbook Collector, giving the book a subtle spiritual undertone, which reminds me of one of Mary Oliver's \"rules\" for herself each time she writes a poem, to let it have \"a spiritual purpose,\" something I re-encountered assigning her poem \"The Swan\" and a little essay about its origins (in Poetry East) to my rare-book-room poetry workshop this weekend.I admire the joy at the heart of Hasidic Judaism.  I loved this book.  And I admire poets who know their purposes so well.

And this made me think of the Red Hat Society, and fun things women do when they get to the stage of wearing red hats.And tonight, for their 57th wedding anniversary, I took my parents to see Mid-August Lunch, a sweet Italian film about a man, his 93-year-old mother, and some other sweet old ladies who come his way.  Here is a New York Times review that offers you a color still and a clip.Mid-August Lunch, or Ferragosto, is a harvest holiday on August 15.  It used to last a month, and it apparently combines the harvest celebration and a celebration of Diana, the hunt, the moon, etc., leaning toward the Roman myth and agriculture, and the Feast of the Assumption, the later Christian celebration.  This harvest holiday reminded me of \"Grape Harvest,\" by Colette, in The Garden of Reading, edited by Michelle Slung.  Which reminds me of purple grapes and red wine.  In the movie, also known as Pranzo di Ferragosto, there's actually a lot of white wine.Which makes me sleepy.  Good night!"},

OK, it's not a book, but it's like a book.  And it lists books by its contributors on the right.And my Diane Lockward poem-of-the-day broke my heart and ended the first section of What Feeds Us.  \"A Change in the Air.\"There was a change in the air around here, thanks to a rainstorm last night.  The balsam out front that had flattened itself on the ground in protest of the heat is standing up straight again.  The back yard balsam is in better soil, and holds water better, too, so it was still standing, but is happier now.  The impatiens is restored in patience.  The sweet autumn clematis spreads its anise scent despite the tiny yellow bugs clustered all along the vines.  I'm saving seed heads of the black-eyed Susans for Kim, and the coneflower is coning.  All my pastel daisies are opening, taking over the bed given to perennial wildflowers.And my son, who goes back to college tomorrow, let me stand and hug him in his bedroom as he packed.  Hug him for a long time.  An unmeasurable moment.Day 194 of the \"What are you reading, and why?\" project, and way back at the beginning of the year a couple I know was reading Half Broke Horses, by Jeanette Walls.  It was for some reason on my mind yesterday, when I wrote about particular sadnesses instead, and this morning, when I stopped by Goodreads, there it was, in an ad by Target, like a little omen/reminder, so here it is now.  I'm interested in its subtitle identification as \"a true life novel.\"Walls's first book was a memoir, The Glass Castle, about her own upbringing, that was a \"common book\" at some colleges, including my son's, so it is in our house, he has read it, and I plan to read it someday.  I do like memoirs and need to read Zippy, by Haven Kimmel, mentioned a couple days ago.  Maybe I did read it.  Maybe that's a problem with memoirs....or my squished brain cells.  Hmm, if I am going to write my own memoirs, 1) I better do it fast, before any more brain cells get squished and 2) I better get vaguely famous fast, so anyone might be interested.  Oh, wait.  The Glass Castle is what made Walls famous!  One more squish.Anyhoo, in Half Broke Horses, she becomes her grandmother, to narrate that memoir, but thus, since she's not her, it's a novel.  Or it's fiction, anyway.  The Washington Post review (posted at Amazon) compares it to Charles Dickens in its sprawl of incident but also points out the limitations of true life as novel structure; it can't go where it needs to go if it didn't go there in true life.This comes back to one of my gentle peeves, the autobiographical novel, the one that some say everyone writes.  Some write one great one--To Kill a Mockingbird--in a lifetime.  Some put that first autobiographical novel in a drawer and move on to true fiction, that might, of course, be based on witnessed/experienced/rearranged true life.  Some do research, combine it with acute observation and wild imagination, and come up with true fiction.  Some do a conscious blend, at some point, as in Alice Munro stories, and The View from Castle Rock, in her historical particular.  And some do a con job, presenting fiction as memoir,  to make it sell.  With variations, blends, and blurrings in between.And so I am back to the fantabulous flowers in Lorel's garden as my image for today.  In my own true life back yard, the blue morning glories I planted from seed are finally blooming.  In Lorel's back yard, well, what you see is what you see."},

It's just one of those days, of loose ends, heavy humid air particles, sparse rain, squished brain cells.Anyway, a lot of people are reading it, as it's on a number of bestseller lists, so I needn't worry about the why, even if I've temporarily lost the particular who.Meanwhile, there is trouble, and particular sadness, at the Virginia Quarterly Review, where a managing editor committed suicide and his boss is accused of being a bully.  What a sad thing.  I wonder if this will end up in a future \"literary feuds\" book, or if the grief and anger in this situation will flare up, then turn to ash.  I feel sorry for everyone involved.Literaries in the mail this week include The Comstock Review and The Sow's Ear Review, both nice magazines with a wonderful variety of fine poems by new and established poets.  I am particularly taken with a center art section in Sow's Ear, Book Sculptures by Samantha Y. Huange, which you can see here at her page at Art Review or at flickr.  It's really gorgeous, in black at white in Sow's Ear, in color at these websites, and there's a particular sadness, perhaps, in the beauty that comes from the artful \"destruction\" of these old books.  But, of course, they have here a new life.Artists and interior decorators come to Babbitt's now and then, wanting old books to use as art, to cut up for collages, or to cut out the centers of to hide things in, or to place on shelves, in cabinets, on little end tables as decoration.  I went to a funeral home recently that used old books as decoration on shelves of its large coat closets and in glass knick-knack cases along with the dishes and figurines.  Even I have been known to cut up books--that were already falling apart--to make collages (or to recycle appropriately by removing the covers) or to stack books in a somewhat sculptural way....Even the indulgence of two poems from What Feeds Us has left a lemony sweet taste of sadness.  \"Heart on the Unemployment Line,\" by Diane Lockward, ends \"Even in grief, it keeps beating.\"  And \"Wren House\" ends, \"We had waited like this once before, / wanting some soft creature to fly in.\"  And so the sadness continues."},

The story involves 3 women who work together at a used furniture place.  The  story takes place in Jordan, Indiana, and Amos Townsend, the minister from  The Solace of Leaving Early, is a minor (so far) character in the book,  so some little bit of overlap with that book.

And what's got to be a dark turn in the plot.  And some twists in the love stories...Speaking of love, the Lockward chocolate of the day, from What Feeds Us, is witty, clever, fun--and a ghazal--\"Love Test: A Ghazal.\"  The ghazal is a Persian poetic form with a repeating rhyme on the second line of every two-line stanza (or couplet)--a sort of perfect form for its original theme and the meaning of the word ghazal: \"the talk of boys and girls.\"  Ghazals were about flirtation, love, and drinking!I have heard two main pronunciations of ghazal--gah ZAHL and GUZ zle.  The first is more graceful; the second, more drunken!Hafiz and Rumi were famous for their ghazals, and Diane Lockward has a lot of fun with hers! One fun aspect of the ghazal is that the poet incorporates his/her own name in the last line.  Yep, she does it!"},

She means, in print periodicals, acknowledging that this information may be quite accessible on the web, but she's not looking for it there.I finished Dreamers of the Day, by Mary Doria Russell, and liked it just fine, though wasn't as wowed as I was by The Sparrow, where the cultural anthropology and the departure into the fantastic were perfectly entwined and justified by the science fiction aspect. I don't mind anyone's genre twisting, but I am pulled more by realistic fiction, which engages me in the same complexities and conflicts I see in my own life.  Amazingly, this happened in The Sparrow, too, though it was mostly set on another planet, entirely imagined.  Thread of Grace had its realistic World War II context, and I was happy to re-learn that history that particular way.  Dreamers of the Day was delightful...enlightening...and is done.  With me admiring the delivery system more than the place I was delivered to.Meanwhile, I am immersed in The Cookbook Collector, by Allegra Goodman, and we are deep into computer technology, and IPOs, and rather far from the cookbook collector at the moment, on p. 161.  I can say that I really, really liked her book Intuition, and its close look at contemporary science and how it's done, specifically the male/female dilemmas still inherent in it, and that I really, really appreciate this book's elegance as it reveals the technology issues.  This is in high contrast to the Stieg Larsson books, which I liked for different reasons, and the way he brandished brand names and made the technology \"insider\" knowledge separate from me.  Goodman makes it intimate instead.  More to come on this.Today's Diane Lockward \"chocolate\" (poem of the day from What Feeds Us) is a tomato.  No, a peach.  No a tomato.

Which seems to happen often with Vonnegut.Now you see it, now you don't!I was fascinated, in my mini-pseudo-research on this topic (Wikipedia, Amazon.com) to learn that \"hocus pocus\" may derive from the ritual and Latin of the Eucharist, a sort of hoc est corpus corruption, or from a Norse sorcerer, Ochus Bochus (sounds good to me), or from the Welsh for \"hoax,\" which is Hovea Pwca, the second part pronounced Pooka, from which we also get Shakespeare's Puck (a personal favorite), or, perhaps some combination of all these into random coincidii form!!!  I love words, and word origins, even if they are far-fetched.  I know a bank where the wild thyme blows....Vonnegut's Hocus Pocus is structurally interesting, being a nonlinear collage of fragments by main character Eugene Debs Hartke (college professor/prison inmate) \"assembled\" by Vonnegut into this piecemeal satire.I love Vonnegut.  I remember reading the short story collection titled God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater as a mere teen, beside my hometown pool.  OK, I was weird.  But surely other teens I knew loved Vonnegut, too!My Diane Lockward \"chocolate\" for the day, from What Feeds Us, actually has a chocolate in it, with a date inside instead of a cherry or apricot.  (Hocus pocus, an unanticipated fruit!  But I'm so weird, I love dates!)  Anyway, it is a lovely and funny prose poem about...ah! dating!...that contains the phrase \"Yesterday a letter appeared in my mailbox...\" which sort of freaks me out, as I am just now proofreading a prose poem that takes place in the foyer and involves a letter in my mailbox!On the other hand, it is always nice to find a kindred spirit.And, to further the random coincidii, a fellow came in the store today who is someone I hope someday to set up with my accidentally celibate friend...who shall remain nameless.  But first, both of them need to read The Sexy Book of Sexy Sex by Kristen Schaal and Rich Blomquist."},

My husband loves The Daily Show, and Kristen Schaal is sometimes on it.  Plus, white socks with red stripes are definitely a turn on around our house.  As are red high tops.In the Unitarian Church yesterday, I actually read my poem \"Fishnets for Jesus\" and got some laughs.  It was part of my \"perverse interlude in which I read 2 poems that mention Jesus.\"  One was about Caravaggio's painting The Rest on the Flight into Egypt, and one was this, which is also posted on Facebook:Fishnets for Jesus  My Jesus-loving friend on Facebookreminds me just to pray harderwhen I’m feeling bad or sad,not to turn away from everyone & everything  and that’s when I pray for thigh-highfishnets, and remember I have some—I bought them for Alex, to wearto the New Year’s Eve party & thenforgot to pack themtill the following year, whendiscreetly I lifted my black skirtjust thigh high—  and I go upstairs and baptize myselfagain in the shower,step out, dry myself off, jot downa quick to-do & grocery listto let myself fully evaporate,and then ease them gently upeach thigh, breathing easily,the way we do when we pray for nothing."},

They were great fans of Harry Potter, Inkheart, and the Pendragon books, and now they are reading Percy Jackson and The Lightning Thief by Rick Riordan and the rest of those books, and the  Geronimo Stilton series.*Jordan, the 5th little houseguest, had to stay home and work her summer job in an ice cream parlor.  We missed her.Not currently engaged in a series, however, Conor is reading The Jester.  \"Who is that by?\" I asked.  \"James Patterson,\" said Conor.  But I see by checking Amazon that a co-author is listed, Andrew Grossman, and that there is some quibble about who is the main author.  At any rate, it's historical fiction, medieval history at that, and if a teenage boy likes it, it must be a good read.As Gaye and I discussed The Road, by Cormac McCarthy, which we had borrowed from her family, Conor also volunteered this:  \"I don't like books that make me think.\"\"Oh, well what kind of books do you like?\" I asked.\"Tom Clancy.\"I had to admit I'd never read a Tom Clancy novel, but I think I have seen some movies based on them.  Yes, I have.After a fond, end-of-summer, sweet goodbye, we watched them head down the road.  Then I headed back out to the picnic table to enjoy the cool evening breeze, the never-say-cicadas, and two \"chocolates\" by Diane Lockward's What Feeds Us--\"Gender Issue\" about a man and his doll, and \"The Shampoo Artist: A Really Dramatic Monologue.\"  Oh, she would have been great in our recent Glitterary Reading at Glitterati Hair Salon!"},
{"title": "The Solace of Coincidii", "date": "Saturday, August 14, 2010", "text": "Day 187 of the \"What are you reading, and why?\" project and Cynthia is reading Nickle and Dimed: On (Not) Getting By in America, by Barbara Ehrenreich, for her book group.  In fact, she is generously gathering used/affordable/recycled copies of the books at Babbitt's, where we can put them on the Local Hold shelf for her temporarily!Before my time, Brian Simpson, the owner of Babbitt's, featured in yesterday's blog and in the Illinois State Alumni Magazine, used to offer a \"wishlist\" at Babbitt's, but it got too unwieldy.  Who knows, though?  If we can add t-shirts and tote bags, maybe we can also revive the wishlist someday!I read excerpts from Nickle and Dimed when they were published in Harper's and other periodicals, and it was good to know the nitty gritty about how hard it is to survive in the United States on limited income.  (Which I have also known firsthand, at various stages of my life!) Some of the details reminded me of a film called Ruby in Paradise, about a young woman trying to get a good job in Florida--a coming of age story, not social criticism or economic critique, but definitely about personal insight and responsibility.  Googling Ruby for you, I realize it stars Ashley Judd, early in her acting career.  No wonder I loved it!Meanwhile, I read on in In the Next Galaxy, by Ruth Stone, and a poem a day, my chocolate indulgence, in What Feeds Us, by Diane Lockward.Diane's poem is \"The Summer He Left\" in which yellow takes over the world, turning to gold.  It begins, \"The lawn filled with dandelions,\" which the speaker finds beautiful, coinciding with my love of the modest, nutritious \"weed,\" poet Martha Silano's respect for edible weeds, and my neighbor Karen's love of the beauty of dandelions in blossom and in wish mode.Yellow is everywhere, in weed and flower and beyond, and this poem made me turn back to Ruth Stone's poem \"White on White,\" in which white flowers are present alongside other white things--Chablis, \"old woman's piss,\" \"white pear bottoms,\" and\"[w]hite mucus from healthy vaginas.\"  Stone's poem evokes, but is of course strikingly different from, Robert Frost's sonnet, \"Design,\" about a white spider on a white heal-all.But, for me, the other freaky coincidence with stumbling upon \"White on White\" this summer was that I'd just drafted a sort of list poem about all the white flowers I'd accidentally arranged (not by design) in my own back yard this summer.  When I get back to it, it will be deepened by awareness of the other poems, but must be its own \"new\" thing.And now, solace.  This morning in my inbox, I found the proofs and contract for works submitted to an anthology on solace that Ellen Beals began shaping in response to 9/11.  It will finally be published now, in ebook and POD formats, and I'll tell you more about that later; there will be a blog, etc.  The solace is of various sorts.  We have lived through, mourned, and considered the events of 9/11, as a country and as a world, and we seek solace for all kinds of things all the time, and Ellen's book is a repository of solace.  My essay on what I was reading for solace at the time mentions Mary Ber, editor of Moon Journal Press, from whom, coincidentally, I received an email yesterday morning, as, recovered from cataract surgery, she'd had a chance to read my chapbook, Living on the Earth.  The book somehow comforted her in her recovery, and coincided with her recent experiences on earth in the second half of her life.  I feel honored."},

Because it is way more fun than Olive Kitteridge.Here are some of the random coincidii related to Babbitt.Babbitt was, for a time, the favorite book of the owner of Babbitt's Books, who is not named Babbitt, no matter how many people call him that.  You can read all about Brian Simpson and the renovation of Uptown Normal* in this really nice article in the Illinois State Alumni Magazine.Said owner has one of those library posters of himself in the window of Babbitt's Books, holding up the book Babbitt, by Sinclair Lewis!  This one, a little mass market paperback.Babbitt's Books just celebrated its 25th year in existence this July, although I still might not have the story straight.  Books were a sideline at first in a vintage clothing store, but now it's all books, all the time.  Unless we add some of those cool book cover t-shirts!  Or tote bags!  (It's phun to be a philistine.)Lorel just celebrated a birthday on August 9.  I won't say which one because:1) I am a lady2) she is a lady3) I don't know4) I should know, but my brain now resembles steamed cauliflower, and I lost trackI am going to a 50th birthday party tonight!  I won't say whose.  But not Lorel's.  And not mine.I just read about Sinclair Lewis and Theodore Dreiser's feud, over the Nobel Prize, sort of--they both wanted it, of course, but there were other things going on:1) Lewis had an alcohol problem2) Dreiser had flirted with Lewis's wife-to-be, Dorothy Thompson3) Lewis had failed to provide a publisher blurb for Dreiser's book, An American Tragedy4) Dreiser had plagiarized or \"lifted\" passages from a book about Russia by Thompson for his own book about RussiaSigh.  You can read about all this and more in Literary Feuds by Anthony Arthur, which also explains, summarizing Swedish scholar Rolf Lunden, why an American finally got the the Nobel Prize, and why Lewis and Dreiser were the top runners.  \"Both writers were valued because they portrayed the United States as a nest of grasping, materialistic, bourgeois philistines and hypocrites, at best shallow and silly, at worst brutal and stupid.\"No wonder Lorel is enjoying the book so much.  Arthur says, \"The Nobel Prize was given to Lewis, in a word, because he insulted his country more entertainingly than Dreiser did....\"And then the two men insulted each other.  And nearly had a fistfight at a writers' dinner.*AKA \"Uppity Town Normal\" by Kim, who is addicted to hummus."},

I told him about when my niece was photographed with Rushdie, when he visited her college.  The photo gave him red eyes, so he did look remarkably satanic.And I am allowing myself one poem a day from What Feeds Us, by Diane Lockward, an indulgence like a fine chocolate.  The first was the title poem, \"What Feeds Us,\" and I can already tell the book will break my heart and make me smile; also, that I've found a kindred spirit, as I, too, have written a poem ending with a woman knowing she needs to eat.Likewise, with \"The First Artichoke,\" the second poem in Lockward's book.  I remember my first artichoke, eaten as a kind of research, as well as a pleasure, with my friend and fellow actress, Lorel Janiszewski.  I was directing her, I think in the Organic Theatre, in a one-woman play she had written called Art-I-Choke.  She is brilliant, so it was funny and pithy and poignant somehow all at once.  And surely she prepared the artichoke we ate in her kitchen.A stage manager would have prepared the artichoke she ate onstage.  Right, Lorel?  Nobody would have trusted me with that...."},

I had to admit to Steve that I had not read any Stephen King except On Writing, and he said he had just ordered it.  Didn't have the heart to tell him we usually have a couple copies of that at Babbitt's, hardback and paperback.  On second thought, he might have ordered a first edition from somewhere, as I think this Hearts in Atlantis was a first edition.  Plus, I realize I have seen the movie, with Anthony Hopkins.It's been one of those days of multiple, frequently interrupted tasks.  Lately I walk into rooms and forget what I've come in for, reminding me of the sleep-deprived days when my babies were...babies.  One is about to go back to high school, the other, to college.  Driving back from high school registration on a newly repaved road--that is, floating along on a fine black macadam--I forgot to turn left onto the street I needed to be on, had to curve and cross the tracks, turn left at a busier street, and there was a fire truck, parked but flashing, an ambulance in the park parking lot near the pool, a police car.  One wonders, one worries.The radio had just told me about yesterday's derailment of a freight train, no one hurt, but it does delay the passenger trains.  One hopes they have books to read.And a fellow who regularly brings books to Babbitt's gave me Strange Beckoning, poems by Helen Carson Janssen, 1951, signed and inscribed, with a card inside about her book signing at Coe's Book Store on October 15, \"the day set aside by Governor Adlai Stevenson as Illinois Poetry Day.\" This year, in the annual cemetery walk in our town, I am to play Helen Davis Stevenson, Adlai's mother.  They are both buried here.\"It's a vanity press,\" said the boss, not buying it, and clearly hurting the man's feelings.\"You can call it vanity, but she was a fine woman and a good poet,\" he said.And I can't see much difference between Helen Carson Janssen having her book published by Exposition Press of New York and Walt Whitman having his Leaves of Grass published, again and again, revisions of it, by a local printer, and at first at his own expense.  Nor much difference between that and a number of small publishers of poetry these days, who leave most of the editing, promotion, and distribution to the poets themselves.Helen Carson Janssen was born in Upper Sandusky, Ohio, famous now in popular culture for the Leather Goddesses of Phobos, a computer game, and before that because Doris Day's character in That Touch of Mink came from there, and, to bring us back to Stephen King, some scenes from The Shawshank Redemption were filmed there.But I want to turn to page 24 of Strange Beckoning, to the poem \"Old Mr. Kirk,\" a man thought \"queer\" by the farmers but loved by the kids because he gave them peppermints.  My great grandfather, of Akron, Ohio, sucked peppermints and shared them with us kids.I don't know what to make of it all.Have a heart.  Especially this one, by Robert Fornal.  Or a fine Italian alabaster paperweight, from Barnes & Noble."},

The non-SOBs (not our real name, as we don't have one), a women's book group, has already read both.Today I handled Iron Joe Bob, by Joe Bob Briggs, a pseudonym, a book dedicated to Bobby Bly, a comic answer to the poet Robert Bly's Iron Man movement.  Many years ago, visiting Seattle, I purchased Iron John, by Robert Bly, at the Elliott Bay bookstore, for a fellow who was showing me around the city when I was there to look at the papers of the poet Michele Murray, who died young of breast cancer.  He was a troubled man, the brother of a close friend, and I was glad to know what to give him, when he expressed intense interest in the book.Yesterday, watching Shutter Island with my daughter so she wouldn't get too scared, I saw a preview for Iron Man II.

{"title": "Never Say Cicada", "date": "Monday, August 9, 2010", "text": "Day 182 of the \"What are you reading, and why?\" project, and Patrick is going to be reading a lot of books, because he wanted to use his credit card and he'd come in for Walden ($3) and Daniel Quinn (which we didn't have), and we only take credit cards for $5 and up (because of the annoying charges)  so I said, \"Have you looked on the Select New Arrivals shelf?\"He found great stuff.  Because he had wanted Quinn, I pointed out Life of Pi, by Yann Martel, for its amazing blend of philosophy and circumstances, as reported to me by Gary, Tony, and other happy readers.  It is in a yet-to-read stack here in my house.I asked if he'd read Fahrenheit 451, by Ray Bradbury, because there it was, a classic we have trouble hanging onto, and, sure enough, he hadn't.  He had read two Vonnegut books he liked a lot--Slaughterhouse Five and Cat's Cradle--so when he saw Jailbirds and Breakfast of Champions, he snapped those up, too!When I asked why he wanted to read Thoreau's Walden, he said he'd seen the film Into the Wild, and wanted to see why someone would want to go into the wild.  In the book by Jon Krakauer about Chris McCandless, we learn that Chris was reading Thoreau before he went on his own discovery of wilderness and self.Odd, how a little technology hassle should lead to an armful of books.  Don't worry, no one forced him.  He chose them all himself and had time to change his mind.  Boss was on the phone, so I couldn't use the credit card machine till he got off.  (Hmm, unfortunate phrasing, perhaps.)  Anyhoo, that technology glitch gave Patrick time to think it over, and he wanted the whole stack.  And now for the cicada.  Billy Collins famously announced in his introduction to The Best American Poetry 2006 that he couldn't make it past the word \"cicada\" in a poem, even though his poem \"The Student\" in The Trouble with Poetry (Random House, 2005) of course has the word \"cicada\" in it.  I always see the fondness, subtlety, and depth in Collins, as well as the humor, and actually enjoyed his snippiness in Ballistics.  He has a right to be snippy; people are always sniping at him.  But, as I am writing prose at the moment, I have no fear of cicadas, alive, in language, or as empty shells.Last night, just before we surrendered to air conditioning, I was enjoying the bit of breeze coming in my window from an area with an evergreen bush and a flower bed that provide a little privacy screen in my cool, sunken office space.  Suddenly something crashed against the glass window above the screen.  A bat?  A transformer moth?  A persistent possum?  No, of course it was a cicada!  A Dog Day Cicada, here in the dog days of August.More about what people are reading to come, but I have a poem up at Leveler this week, if you'd like to read it and comment.  (Some people took this little car ride with me recently at a reading.)I love Leveler for its wonderful brief essay--click the box to the right when you get there--on how the poem works.  Then you can click Level With Us to submit a comment of your own on the poem and/or essay."},

The Complete History of the Universe, co-authored by Brian May, of the rock band Queen, and/or A Village Lost and Found, May's latest book, about early 3D photography.  Among those people are Chris and Kim, who heard a recent NPR story about May, and Bob, who posted a link on Facebook.  Ah, how I love NPR, Wikipedia, and Facebook.  Ah, how I love people who tell me about cool stuff to read.A Village Lost and Found, co-authored with Elena Vidal, is subtitled An Annotated Tour of the 1850s series of stereo photographs \"Scenes in Our Village\" by T. R. Williams.  It reproduces some wonderful photography and explains stereoscopy, a method of side-by-side viewing that produces 3D effects.  It is similar to the stereopticon that delighted Emily Dickinson, and showed her places she'd never been!  The book comes with a contemporary viewing device.The earlier book, Bang!, co-authored with Patrick Moore and Chris Lintott, came out in 2006, and is indeed about the Big Bang theory of the universe.  May studied astrophysics, and the NPR story explains how the \"stomp stomp clap\" effect in the recording of \"We Will Rock You\" was due to May's knowledge of sound waves.  It got into the song at first by way of calculation, of a different sort, and inspiration at live performances, and then had to be recreated for the recording.

It starts in the same territory I left with Houdini Pie, by Paul Michel, as there are bootleggers and trouble with war and influenza, but now we have gone to Egypt with Lawrence of Arabia!Agnes, the narrator, tells us we don't realize the terrible effects of the flu, and how soldiers spread it on the trains, and how more people died of the flu than in battle in World War I.  That is indeed sobering.  But I got the devastation from William Maxwell's work before this, in They Came Like Swallows. That was sad and poignant all the way through.  Dreamers is lively and fun and, as with Russell's other novels, I am learning so much about the people, the cultural and political conflicts of the time, and the inner life.  I am also still reading In the Next Galaxy, by Ruth Stone, poems.  They are marvelous, simple, and rich.  I can turn anywhere in the book and find something odd and wonderful, edgy or disturbing:  \"Corn is universal, / so like a Roman senator.\"  Or: \"The play yard with its automobile tire / hanging from the one tree, like a lynching.\"  Or, from the poem titled \"Not Expecting an Answer\":This tedious letter to you...what is one life to another?We walk around inside our bags,sucking it in, spewing it out.My sister, who had a lovely time in Michigan at the shore and here with family, has to go home to troubles in her house.

John Irving praises the book at Amazon.com, so probably everyone who loves Irving will love this one.

And waiting at home is Reading Lolita in Tehran: A Memoir in Books, by Azar Nafisi, which really is about women's experience in Iran.So now Maggie has plenty of women's and men's experiences at hand in memoir, fiction, and poetry, and also knows how to describe a used book and how things are organized (or not) in a used bookstore.

Well, not really old, just there and back.  During World War II or the Korean War.  OK, yes, probably old.  My dad was in the army during the Korean War, though he did not go to Korea, and he is pretty darn old!So, back to the topic of reading!  On Monday, a veteran of the Korean War came in looking for a book called Raid at Inchon: Left Behind the Lines by Katherine Jones.  Borders had sent him over to us at Babbitt's because they didn't have it and noticed that it was offered used online.  We looked on the shelves in our Military History aisle, the Korean War section, just in case, but no luck.  So I Googled Katherine Jones!  I love Google!  Anyhoo, I found a website for her, info on ordering that particular book directly from her, and info and a phone number for ordering through Author House.  So I made that old soldier happy!Then, later that day, an old soldier called me on the phone.  \"I'm looking for a book,\" he said.  \"Do you have time to hear my story?\"\"OK,\" I said, and he told one!  It was a story about being on a ship with other soldiers going back and forth to Pearl Harbor and then one day not being allowed on the upper decks.  He said he then read the book The Revolt of Mamie Stover and figured out what was going on!  They were transporting prostitutes!  The book is actually a novel by William Bradford Huie, but it was based on Huie's wartime experiences, and is about a woman abused by Hollywood who turns into a war profiteer of this particular sort!  Well, this is a book we actually had, a Signet paperback mentioning the film version, but not the 1951 cover pictured at the Wikipedia article.  You can see the whole cover, front and back, above!  It used to sell for a few cents, but our glamorous well-read copy was now around $20, as a vintage edition.  He definitely wanted to read it again, so we sent it off.  And he didn't know about the film, which he can now also seek out!  What old soldier wouldn't want to see a film set in Hawaii and starring Jane Russell?!So I made another old soldier happy!"},
{"title": "Electric Sheep", "date": "Tuesday, August 3, 2010", "text": "Day 176 of the \"What are you reading, and why?\" project, and yesterday, late in the day, a young man walked in the store and asked, \"Do androids dream of electric sheep?\"\"I don't know!  Do they?\" was my not-so-cool-I'm-someone-who-reads-Barbara-Pym response, but it was fun to say, and he actually enjoyed it.Of course, what he was hoping for was the novel by Philip K. Dick, which we seldom have on hand for more than a day or two.  Amazingly, the boss leaned over and pulled out the mass marketback from a stack at his feet, and the guy got it for $4, a real bargain, as this particular edition is $13-20 online now.  It pays to walk into our store.  (More about that, and military history, tomorrow.)We also have an ex-library copy of Maze of Death ($100) and an edition of the Uncorrected Proofs of The Golden Man ($300) in the rare book room.  Dick is a popular guy that everyone who loves science fiction tells me to read.Because I live in the Land of Random Coincidii, my son had just checked Blade Runner (Director's Cut) out of the library and wanted to watch it that night.  I hadn't seen it for a really long time, so it was all new to me except for Daryl Hannah's black eyes and acrobatics and Rutger Hauer's amazing beauty.  What a complete world is created in that film.  We had seen Inception the night before, with its phenomenal special effects on a high-density huge screen, and yet Blade Runner was just as rich, real, and intriguing, partly through atmosphere, and the consistency of rain and search lights.Anyway, as the credits rolled, I said to the family, \"This is based on a novel by Philip K. Dick,\" and just then the credit appeared, so I spoke the title, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? exactly when their eyes were reading it, and they were impressed by my esoteric knowledge.  Otherwise, they think I am goofy.The title itself comes from something else, also credited at the end of the movie, with thanks to William S. Burroughs and Alan E. Nourse (also hard to come by at Babbitt's).  Wikipedia explains that Burroughs did a film treatment of Nourse's novel, The Bladerunner, called Blade Runner.  I remember somebody trying to explain all that to me in the store one day, but I am grateful to find the details at Wikipedia now!OK, time to count my bishops instead of my electric sheep.  (It's sort of a Barbara Pym joke, Some Tame Gazelle.)Whoa.  But wait.  The random coincidii just got freaky.  There is a website called electric sheep about collective dreaming (theme of Inception).

He says people kept telling him about the series, and how the author died but secured a writer to keep the series going after his death.  He finally tried reading one and was standing in line, book in hand, dustjacket removed, when a fellow came up and said, \"Is that a Robert Jordan book?\" even though, without its jacket it was not readily identifiable....\"Oh, it looks about the size and shape of a Robert Jordan novel,\" answered the man.Gus calls these avid readers \"Jordan nuts.\"  Almonds, anyone?Me, I'm a roasted Pym nut, still enjoying phrases like \"the Ovaltine had loosened her tongue\" an bits of dialogue like \"Well, Harriet, there's no getting away from it, he reminds me of a sheep!\"A woman once told me I wrote like Barbara Pym, a compliment I could only truly appreciate once I had read some, and later when I needed a letter of recommendation, I reminded her of what she had said, and she declined to include the comparison, saying, \"No one would believe me,\" which is just the kind of awkward backhanded compliment Barbara Pym would enjoy.People keep dying.   Today it was the theatre photographer who took my headshot, the one you see here at my profile.  Sigh.  Wheel of time, indeed. Remember in the film Carousel, when the girl dances on the wheel at the beach?  And Billy gives her the star?  Everybody, rest in peace."},
{"title": "The Dead and the Living", "date": "Sunday, August 1, 2010", "text": "Day 174 of the \"What are you reading, and why?\" project, and today I am pondering the dead and the living.  That is a wonderful book of poems and was my introduction to Sharon Olds.  The Dead and the Living was the Lamont Poetry selection for 1983, judged by June Jordan, Charles Simic, and David Wagoner.  It also won the 1984 National Book Critics' Circle Award for Poetry.  I have taught several poems from this book in literature classes, or used them as prompts or samples in creative writing classes because they are straightforward, readily available in both language and feeling, and have jagged edges and hard emotions, so the student readers and writers respect them.  They are real. But there is nothing for me in them today, no phrase or set of lines to mark the sudden death of Chris Al-Aswad, a lovely young man who lived in my town, came into the bookstore where I work frequently and just a couple weeks ago, and who is/was the editor of a gorgeous online literary magazine called Escape Into Life.  The title so clearly, now, in retrospect, states what he wanted to do, \"escape into life.\"I don't know the circumstances of his death, nor what he wanted to escape into life from, but I know from his blog that he had troubles, tough times, and tenderness, and that he was driven by glorious aspirations.  He wanted to be a writer.  He wanted people to read what he wrote.  And they did.  He showcased art and poetry beautifully in his magazine, got people engaged in the essays; he gathered a bunch of lively, creative writers to make it an exciting place to visit...and now, dreadfully, he is gone.  I see that his mother, Rosalind Al-Aswad, was a visual artist, coming to that after a life as a businesswoman and clothing designer for Sears.  She died young, too, at 60, from a debilitating disease.  Chris died at 31, much too young. Sometimes I celebrate, whimsically, the random coincidii of life.  Randomness applies more soberly here.  In this case, I was at the beach in Michigan with family and had just been talking about Chris with my sister, Chris, saying how delighted I was to have met him and, very recently, taking over when his poetry editor left.  (We had just put up the Sarah J. Sloat feature the week before.)  Oddly then, mid-week, I had a pang.  Something troubling, undefined.Friday night I dozed on the couch while the rest of the vacationing family played a loud, raucous game of Catch Phrase, followed by Taboo.  Then I sat up, fully awake, and went page by page through the Chicago Tribune, not something I usually do.  Near the end, at the alphabetical beginning of the small-print obituaries, there was \"Al-Aswad, Christopher R.,\" an unusual name, terribly familiar.  I tore it out with my fingers, the 2\" x 2\" obituary, and carried it around in my pocket till I got home.  I kept hoping it wasn't him.  But it is.His wake was Friday, his services Saturday, in the Chicago area, when I was traveling home to the town in which he most recently lived.  He is of a mixed heritage, interfaith family--Russian Jewish mother, Iraqi Christian father--and memorials go to the Shem Center for Interfaith Spirituality, 708 N. Harvey Ave., Oak Park, IL, 60302.  Or to the Rosalind D. Al-Aswad Memorial Fund, School of the Art Institute of Chicago, Office of Development, 37 S. Wabash, Suite 818, Chicago, IL 60603."},
{"title": "I Was at the Beach", "date": "Saturday, July 31, 2010", "text": "Days 167 through 173 of the \"What are you reading, and why?\" project, and I was at the beach, where the basic answer to the \"Why?\" question is \"because I wanted something to read at the beach.\"  But there was great variety in what people were reading.I saw everything from a MAD Magazine cartoon book to The Passion of the Western Mind, with Oprah and Michael Crichton in between.  Oprah was represented by the biography by Kitty Kelley, and the Crichton was there via Next, which I have determined from the illustration, not from being able to read the title from my beach chair.  Yes, I did scrutinize and eavesdrop.  No, I did not intrude on people's reading, conversations, or family groups.I saw more hardcovers than I expected to see, and one was a library book, right down at the water's edge.  Egad!  (My husband took a library book, too, but he left it back at the house when he was at the beach.  It's still Last Call.) One energetic girl swam and played the whole time, then, packing up, dropped her brand new clean hardcover with pristine dust jacket (as they say) on the sand.  \"Oops,\" she said, then quietly kept brushing it off with a corner of her towel, while keeping an eye on her dad, who never noticed.I saw sudoku and crossword books, and many magazines.  One woman studied an issue of Handyman for a long while, then turned to Star Magazine.  A threesome brought a huge stack of magazines, with various titles, including Traveler.I saw The Nine Rooms of Happiness, happily set aside by a mother when her young daughter wanted her to come dig in the sand with her.  Digging in the sand at the beach has got to be the No. 1 room of happiness!Overheard conversations included a reference to Nietzsche, a mock scolding--\"You ought to be reading better literature than that, like what your husband is reading\"--and, from the literary husband, \"I'm going to meet this guy next week in Cincinnati at a book signing, not for this book, for another one.  They're all short stories about himself...,\" and then, as if he sensed someone eavesdropping, he leaned over to whisper the rest into another man's ear.   I have determined that this was a book by Tucker Max.  Beach reading, indeed.But I did have mini-conversations with a few individuals, including some family members and friends:Kristi is reading Last Night in Twisted River \"because John Irving is my favorite.  It takes me a long time to get through books, though, because I read them in bed at night.\"\"Me, I stay up till one,\" said Maggie, who, in the summer, sleeps till noon.  \"I'm trying to read Othello.\"  Maggie, a great reader, who, nonetheless, actually brought no books to the beach, has already read two things on her summer reading list: 1984 and Brave New World.  Judy is reading Blood Orange, by Drusilla Campbell, about an art historian (and Judy herself has a degree in art history) in a midlife crisis (don't know about that) who goes to Italy and then comes home to her husband and child, who goes missing.Alex is reading Hannibal, by Thomas Harris, and reads Raymond Chandler and Dashiell Hammett over and over in the summer, when he's not teaching.My dad is reading Dance of the Happy Shades by Alice Munro, not because all the women in his family enjoy Alice Munro, but because he read and discussed her story \"Boys and Girls,\" which is included in a Great Books Foundation anthology, and thought he'd like to read more.  Also brought to the beach, but already read by my mom, was Hateship, Friendship, Courtship, Loveship, Marriage, by Munro, which I have read and enjoyed, despite its awkward title.  My mom was reading To Kill a Mockingbird, which she finished early in the week, moving on to Remains of the Day, by Kazuo Ishiguro.  \"I can't believe this is written by a Japanese man,\" she said, then read a little about the author, and it made more sense, as he had moved to England as a child. She has the movie tie-in cover, and we had all seen the movie when it came out.  She was in the mood for To Kill a Mockingbird because of its 50th anniversary and because she hadn't read it for years, after teaching it to high schoolers for many.  She had snapped up Remains of the Day and The Lovely Bones because there they were on the Select New Arrivals shelf by the door of Babbitt's when she was looking for 1) 1984 and Brave New World (which are always stored there and always hard to come by, as always popular) and 2) looking for beach reading.  She's halfway through The Lovely Bones now, which my sister enjoyed (despite the difficult subject matter) for its sustained \"realism\" (\"Realism?\" asked my mom) in an imagined voice.  None of us has seen the movie.  I told them about Lucky, the author's memoir, and hearing about (and then reading) both books in an NPR interview, after having many college students recommend to me The Lovely Bones.  I have not yet read The Almost Moon, Alice Sebold's second novel.My sister Chris was reading Ghostwritten, by David Mitchell, because they did not have Cloud Atlas at the bookstore when she went, and she thought it would be good to read his first novel, anyway.  She was loving it, all week, stopping to read sentences to me.  She knew she was interested at the very first sentence, \"Who was breathing on the nape of my neck?\"  Then she noticed that each new voice somehow used the phrase \"nape of the neck\" and soon she was hooked and admiring.  I will \"inherit\" the book when she goes back to Ohio after her high school reunion, in our hometown.And I was reading Barbara Pym!  I read Excellent Women and then started re-reading Some Tame Gazelle, both about funny church women involved in the life of the vicarage.  There's much more than that going on, including a kind of wry, subtle feminism that co-exists with the prevailing values of a culture that is sort of pre-feminism, but is therefore a quiet and radical feminism in which, by all appearances, women are happily subservient to men.  But not really.I also finished Level Green, a book of poems by Judith Vollmer, with a more \"out there\" feminist impulse, and Houdini Pie, a novel by Paul Michel, who is a wonderful storyteller.  There is more to say about these, but I will say it 1) tomorrow and/or 2) elsewhere as 3) my hair is sandy."},
{"title": "The Big Cheese", "date": "Saturday, July 24, 2010", "text": "Day 166 of the \"What are you reading, and why?\" project, and Kay is reading The Mammoth Cheese, by Sheri Holman, because she could get a bagful of books for $2 at her library book sale, and it was available.  It really is about cheese making on a small farm.  And the birth of a bunch of babies.  And complications.One plot element is that the cheese maker wants to take a big cheese to the White House, which really happened once.  There's a picture book about that, A Big Cheese for the White House: The True Tale of a Tremendous Cheddar, by Candace Fleming, illustrated by S. D. Schindler.  (I think I have seen this one at Babbitt's!)Meanwhile, Zack, Kay's son, not usually a reader, has been zipping through books this summer!  He's already read Because of Winn Dixie, by Kate DiCamillo and Diary of a Wimpy Kid by Jeff Kinney.  Now he's reading Hoot by Carl Hiaason, which is really about owls.  Miniature owls!We sometimes have owls in the back yard.  Sometimes hawks.  Right now we have caterpillars. A jillion of them.  OK, at 7 on one hanging plant.  They are green and black and eating themselves huge and should soon, according to Eric Carle, in The Very Hungry Caterpillar, turn into 7 fabulous cut-paper collage butterflies.   Do owls eat caterpillars?  I know miniature owls don't.  They would gag on these.  That, or get squirted, as I did, with neon green caterpillar innards.  I was just trying to rescue the poor thing. It had fallen on the patio after eating the thing it was hanging on.And that is life.I will be out of Internet access for a while, but still asking people what they are reading and writing it down in my little black book.  I will tell you about it later."},
{"title": "Of Boobies and Baseball", "date": "Friday, July 23, 2010", "text": "Day 165 of the \"What are you reading, and why?\" project, and Ruthie is reading Fifty-Nine in '84, by Edward Achorn, about Old Hoss Radbourn, Barehanded Baseball, and the Greatest Season a Pitcher Ever Had, because of the coincidence that Old Hoss Radbourn lived in her town, she likes baseball history more than baseball itself, and a nephew happened to be a producer of the documentary We Believe, about Cubs fans.I am not yet reading The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest, by Stieg Larsson, because I do not have it, in English or Swedish, but I fear Nora Ephron has read at least one book of the trilogy, as she nails it in this spoof (with a few spoilers, so be warned), \"The Girl Who Fixed the Umlaut,\" in The New Yorker online.  I love Ephron, her sense of humor, and her own tiny boobies, which she has written about in an essay that appears in some college readers.  It is really about bras, not boobies, but boobies go in bras.  If they want to.Speaking of feminism, I am reading In the Next Galaxy, by Ruth Stone, and Level Green, by Judith Vollmer--that is, I am reading two books of poems at the same time, along with The Death of Adam, a book of essays by Marilynne Robinson, as all of these things are intense, and I need to space them out a bit, by alternating--and both poets are steeped in feminism of the late-20th-century sort, its wild waters swirling around us if we grew up in it, its definitions and factions ever-changing.  This came home to me in a recent discussion over at poet Martha Silano's blog, Blue Positive, and I will ponder it for a while, and also how lucky I am to be living when I do, where I do, with something closer to equal rights for women than many women ever had the chance to see or enjoy.  I've lived through the backlash, too, but women have worked very hard to secure rights and freedoms, and to be considered equally human, of equal human value.  Thank you.  (And I don't think a girl in baseball lingerie is a threat to what we've achieved.)  I am lucky, for instance, to be able to read humor about boobies by Nora Ephron and shop for a baseball-stitch bra if I want to, and also to have women be called poets, not poetesses, with the old connotations of dismissal in that \"poetess,\" and have their work taken seriously.I am also pondering a few lines of poetry, from Vollmer, that state the opposite of yesterday's (pre-meme) entry concluding with Dickinson on the too-bright light.  Here is a quotation from \"Palomas Fountain\" by Judith Vollmer:He tells me poetry isn't sodifferent from welding:you shield your eyes too long from the blue flameyou can't shape the iron.The \"he\" is her father, evidently a welder.  This hit me at the right time, thinking I need to look directly at the blue flame these days, even if it does blind me, or I won't be able to shape the poem.This must be what happened to Ruth Stone, who is now blind.  (Speaking metaphorically about literal blindness, which has its own causes, unknown to me.)P.S. to Kim: A meme is something that gets repeated, particularly across the Internet, like those sets of questions you answer at Facebook, etc.  P.P.S. to random commercial services related to selling sex who might be attracted to the \"boobies\" in my title and image: I won't be posting your comments/ads for services.  This is something else.  I am not selling sex, nor using sex to sell the idea of reading.  Sigh....  As if that would work or could happen.  I am just mixing things together in a humorous, serious, in-constant-awe-of-the-world way.  Everything is out there."},

{"title": "Not Really Cooking with Pooh", "date": "Thursday, July 22, 2010", "text": "Day 164 of the \"What are you reading, and why?\" project, and my book group is going to be reading The Cookbook Collector, by Allegra Goodman, because Kim and Suzie heard about it on the radio coming to the meeting where we discussed The Wishbones, by Tom Perrotta.I have read Intuition by Allegra Goodman, and enjoyed it, and so has Kim, who borrowed it from me, but she doesn't remember that right now, because she has been drinking red wine.  Intuition is about science, what goes on during research projects, and the male/female competitive aspect.  And the different ways men and women may approach science.  I found it fascinating and made little marginal notes that I forgot about when I lent her the book, but she enjoyed them, even if they were personal.Cookbook Collector is about sisters!  AND antiquarian book collecting.  Oh, gosh, this is going to be one of those books I wish I'd written.  AND about business, so I hope to learn a lot about a world I do not understand, just as I did with Jane Smiley's book about real estate and greed in the 80s, Good Faith.The discussion of The Wishbones was fun.  We had:--wedding cake--Cheetos (for cheating)--wine (including Red Guitar and one with a cock on the label)--almonds (like Jordan almonds but not; instead Almond Joy almonds and York Peppermint almonds)We mused on whether Dave had done the right thing (at various times, no spoilers here), and the patterns of panic and cold feet before weddings, and whether guys can really grow up in time to marry, or at all.  We are a mixed bunch--gay, straight, married, not, etc.--but all women, so we have a fine bunch of experiences and perspectives and appreciated seeing how men think in this novel.  Perrotta was compared to Nick Hornby, called an American Hornby, and there was talk of The Wedding Singer, with Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore.And then we watched this, made for and shown by the daughter and son-in-law of one of our members:The Road to the Reception (8 minutes of fun that the wedding guests watched while waiting for the new couple to enter the reception)You will know which one she is when you get there."},
{"title": "The Never-Ending Coincidii", "date": "Wednesday, July 21, 2010", "text": "Day 163 of the \"What are you reading, and why?\" project, and I am going to go ahead and tell you what I am reading because of the never-ending coincidii that I love...and because a week is coming of no Internet access, when I will be interviewing people and writing the daily blog entries in a simple black journal and transferring them here later...and because it is poetry, and I am still addicted to poetry.I am reading The Never-Ending, by Andrew Hudgins, because it fell into my hands at Babbitt's, and I snapped it up, having read individual poems by Hudgins all over the place in journals and at important poetry websites, and having heard him read at an AWP Conference in Chicago one year.  There was something so humble and yet elevated and intense about him when he read his few poems--it was a group reading--and I had this feeling I get that is like (mentioned here before) Joan Didion's daughter saying, \"I need to talk to her,\" about Georgia O'Keeffe.  The cover is a gorgeous painting called \"Bultman's Garden\" by Michael Mazur, and I have not reproduced it here in case there's a copyright thing, as for some reason the cover does not appear readily at Amazon or Goodreads, but it's there if you click the link to Amazon Marketplace sellers.  And the book is not much mentioned at the important poetry websites, so was it shunned, or something?  It deals with Christ, civil rights in the South, and gardens, among many other things.  Click on \"Praying Drunk\" for a fine, wild ride!Anyway, one coincidence I love is that Hudgins teaches at Ohio State University, in Columbus, where I have friends and family, so if I am ever brave enough maybe I can call him up sometime when I am visiting.  Or maybe my niece will meet him at Writing Camp.  My dad got his masters at OSU.  My sister teaches at Otterbein, where she loves the English department and likes to talk to poetry people.  It could happen.  Maybe someday I will have red wine with Andrew Hudgins and can ask him about praying drunk.A poem called \"The Garden Changes\" ends with the line \"and red, red, red, red, red,\" something I understand perfectly from the changes in my own being and my own garden and from my summer of red, red, red, red, red, reading Rumi and keeping a red-beaded journal with a gold-beaded heart on it.  (I have a poem called \"Red Nasturtium\" from this summer, that tries to compress the intensity of Rumi's spiritual red in 3 1/2 lines, for a reason.)So I was pondering the difficulty of being \"a religious poet,\" whether indeed that causes some people to step aside, to shy away.  Hudgins is a serious, professional poet, just as Flannery O'Connor was a serious writer of fiction, her work fully informed by her Catholicism but also functioning as fiction on fiction's own terms, rippling out in meaning in the minds of readers thanks to what is provided in the story itself.There is nothing easy, sentimental, or one-sided about Hudgins's poems.  They are as intellectually challenging and humanly gripping as any other powerful poems I've read that don't dwell on a religion-specific set of images and topics.  The only time I felt perhaps directly admonished to be his kind of Christian, was, appropriately, in  \"Crucifixion,\" about a cross burning in Montgomery, Alabama.  The poem ends with a challenge issued as a question, to keep it open: \"Or does God simply choose us all?\"  Certainly the poem made me feel that I ought to do more for social justice, but I guess, open as I am, I returned to my own questions and open definitions of \"God.\"  The poem didn't let me off the hook, in terms of human choice and human action, but it did leave things open, ultimately.  In fact, in the center of the poem, the speaker confesses his own doubt:I would have said he died for us, our sins,but I no longer know who Jesus is.He's someone walking through his life--or hers--until God whispers, It's you.  And God's ignored.In the context of the poem, the one who \"died for us\" is not only Jesus, but a boy in the previous stanza who \"shotgunned himself.\"  So the It's you just keeps resonating.And now I should mention the coincidence of a painting I love called Now You of a naked Jesus pointing his long, long arm to his left, my right, at someone outside the frame, who was of course, also me.  I saw it years ago at the Aldo Castillo Gallery, where my husband was also showing his work, so I send you there, even though I don't find that painting there.... Maybe it has found its home!And I love how The Never-Ending opens with Socrates, who never wrote anything down, saying, \"If anyone asks you 'what that is, of which the inherence makes the body hot,' you will reply not heat (this is what I call the safe and stupid answer), but fire, a far superior answer.\"  What translation is that?  I don't recall Plato/Socrates using the word \"stupid,\" but it's fun to stumble on it in Hudgins.And I love the poem \"Bewilderments of the Eye\" and its epigraph by Plato:The bewilderments of the eye are of two kinds and arise from two causes, either from coming out of the light or going into the light.And how this, and the poem itself, remind me of Emily Dickinson:Tell all the Truth but tell it slant--Success in Circuit liesToo bright for our infirm DelightThe Truth's superb surpriseAs Lightning to the Children easedWith explanation kindThe Truth must dazzle graduallyOr every man be blind--And now this never-ending blog entry is....."},

It wasn't one either of us had heard of before, but the young man has loved other Verne--the well-known, popular stuff like A Journey to the Center of the Earth and Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea, so he was glad to have discovered this one.I had forgotten that Jules Verne (1828-1905) worked in the theatre early on, doing librettos for operettas.  When his dad found out, he disowned him, so Verne had to become a stockbroker to pay the bills.  Heh.  Maybe the dad is eating his shoe in some version of the afterlife now!According to Wikipedia, Verne's dad was punishing him early on for his non-business minded adventures.  At 12, Verne snuck onto a ship called the Coralie, hoping to sail to India, but his dad caught him and whipped him.  \"I shall from now on travel only in my imagination,\" said Verne, and that's exactly what he did. (Actually I did remember the Coralie, probably from one of those blue hardcover biographies I read as a kid, from the library!!)Verne traveled anywhere he wanted in his imagination--under the sea, around the world in 80 days, and to Paris in the 20th century!  Master of the World was a late work, published in 1904.  The 20th-century Paris book was not published till 1993, tucked away as ahead of its time.And the sci fi discoveries just continued today at Babbitt's.  A regular customer found several things he wanted, \"some in the scifi aisle, and some in the bathroom.\"  Regular customers know we keep our excess sci fi paperbacks on the shelves in the bathroom, right under the extra paper towels."},

{"title": "The History of Men's Wishes", "date": "Friday, July 16, 2010", "text": "Day 158 of the \"What are you reading, and why?\" project and the local men's history book club is reading Hoboes: Bindlestiffs, Fruit Tramps, and the Harvesting of the West, by Mark Wyman, because they are history buffs, and this is great history!  I've mentioned the book here before, because Wyman is a local historian and author, but I mention it again because one of the book club members came into Babbitt's yesterday, hoping for it.  Hoping perhaps the boss, who is in the local men's history book club, might have ordered in bulk, at a discount, but no.....  We don't really do that.This fellow can't make this month's meeting, but he wants to read the book anyway.  \"Well, after the meeting, a few copies will probably come in,\" I suggested, knowing these guys are good about clearing their shelves, making room for more, sharing with the less affluent but just as avid readers.\"Then I've got to be reading the next book!\" he said.I've finished The Wishbones, by Tom Perrotta, and I loved it.  In fact, in addition to making me laugh, it made me cry, unexpectedly.  It is subtle and real.  I love books like that, especially if they are also hilarious.  It taught me a lot about men's wishes, and that tendency to hang back and be boys, man-boys, forever.  How, inside a man-boy, even a man-boy with a desire to be a rock star, there can be a sensitive, goofy, aware, mistake-making real man.  You know, I am easily pleased.  Sort of like the dead duchess in \"My Last Duchess.\"  Sigh....  I will read anything, and I am open to the unexpected.   I have set books aside...to read later...but the only book I never got back to that a bunch of people told me was wonderful was The Lost Father, by Mona Simpson.  I'm sorry, Mona.  Maybe I should give it another try.  But I don't want to.Other than that, though, I am able to set aside judgement, for the most part, even if what I am reading isn't grabbing me.  Oh, dear, Julie, I have set aside Three Men in a Boat, by Jerome K. Jerome.  I know I will pick it up again, on vacation.  I am taking it with me to water.  Along with Barbara Pym, just in case.Speaking of the duke who was speaking of his last duchess, while preparing to marry the next, in the mall today (where I had gone for Beer Nuts treats, including Insane Grain, to take to an upcoming poetry reading, coming up tomorrow, in fact, in a gallery in Arlington Heights, Illinois), and waiting for my daughter and her friend, who were looking for shorts and did not find any, I saw a man reading The Power Broker: Robert Moses and the Fall of New York, by Robert A. Caro. More men's history.  Not unexpectedly about power.  And the wish for it.I observed him, imagined him waiting for his wife to shop, as might a character in The Wishbones, got interrupted in my imaginary history of this stranger in a St. Louis Cardinals shirt by a call from my daughter in a dressing room, and suddenly noticed he was up and walking ahead of his pregnant wife, who had no shopping bags.  Where had she come from?  He was walking very fast, and ahead and away from her.  That was sad, until I realized she had nothing to do with him.  Her real husband appeared.  And the power broker was power walking the mall.And now, for some odd reason, I offer \"Opal Innocence,\" a poem that seems unlikely to be published anywhere else but here, and seems both pertinent and off topic.Opal Innocence   It keeps on blooming in the big green pot:pink bonnet, fat white lip, yellow eye.   An ugly babyif that’s what you pictured in the stroller   of line two.  I can’t pretendthis is not a poem.  We all know it is   unwise to hang on too longto innocence.  It’s a kind of arrested development   say fathers and psychologists(also a favorite TV show, cancelled—   too smart, too quirky—but we have it on DVD, because, yes!—   I grew up, my reproductive organs functioned,and I have a family that watches TV….   Remember the ugly babyepisode on Seinfeld, the show about nothing?  Now, be kind.  Consider the poem’s parenthetical emptinessand what it might possibly mean.)"},
{"title": "Before OnStar", "date": "Thursday, July 15, 2010", "text": "Day 157 of the \"What are you reading, and why?\" project, and I have been reading Before OnStar, a poetry chapbook by Sarah Carson, from Etched Press.  Sarah is an editor with RHINO and a communications specialist with Switchback Books. She answered some of my questions by email, and here they are:Sarah, your book just came out from Etched Press of Wilmington, North Carolina. Can you tell us a little about the press, and how you got involved with it?I found Etched Press in the Poet’s Market when I was looking for a publisher for the chapbook. The mission statement of the press is \"writing that remains.\" It actually goes against the nature of chapbooks, because chapbooks aren't meant to last forever, so the goal is to publish writing that remains in the reader's memory. The chapbooks come from open and solicited submissions, and both are completely free.Are all Etched Press chapbooks this handy 6 ½” by 4 ¾” size?  All of the chapbooks are supposed to be 5\" x 7\"  J  But, yes, they are all in that same, handy size.  J  [I guess I am ruler-challenged, as well as math-challenged in general.  5” x 7”—yes, that makes sense.  Sigh….]  The book is “for GG—who has been fictionalized in these poems.” Can you tell us a little about GG and your inspiration for the poems in the book?The poems are all semi-autobiographical about growing up in Flint, Michigan—a city that’s undergone a massive shift from prosperity to poverty in the past few decades.  GG is my grandmother, and she appears in one of the last poems in the collection: “In Buick City.”  In the poem I tell the story of her being robbed at gunpoint but then depict her as afraid to continue with her normal routine because of it.  I make a point to say she’s been “fictionalized” because the real story is that while she did get robbed three times at gunpoint at the same grocery store, she still goes and gets her groceries there every week.  The inspiration for these poems (and what I hope readers take away) is that same spirit—that unwillingness to give up on yourself even when it seems like everything that was once familiar is lost.  I think there’s something beautiful about that desperation to move forward.  They are all prose poems. What drew you to that form for this book, and what are your thoughts on prose poetry in general, its distinction (if/when there is one) from “flash fiction,” and the blurring of genres we often see these days in poetry?I’m not sure what ever drew me to prose poems.   I know I tend be drawn to them both as a reader and a writer more than traditional poetry, and for the types of stories I like to tell, the prose form seems to fit well.  My poems tend to be narrative, but I think they differ from flash fiction in that I pay a lot more attention to rhythm and density than I think a flash fiction writer is required to.  I always want the reader to understand the story, but I let the reader fill it in for themselves from one image to the next.  I also pay a lot of attention to the way my poems sound—which I think is biggest distinction between the two genres: a poem is about the music, and I hope there’s music in my work even if it’s written a paragraph.   I see in this book a lovely, tender, gritty truth about “lives of quiet desperation.” I care about the people, even as I cringe at some of the behaviors, and wish it would work out for them. So I see the book as expanding my compassion, which is one of the reasons I read. What are some of the reasons you write?   When I was writing the poems in this collection, I feel like I was probably writing out of an instinct towards self-preservation.  When I left Flint and went away to college, I often felt out-of-place and homesick for the kind of lifestyle and culture that I eventually began to write about.  I would read books about factory life or Midwest poets like Philip Levine, so when I began writing seriously I tried to imitate the spirit of those writers who I thought really wrote about the heart of living in the Midwest or in industrial/de-industrialized places.  Even now as my poems are becoming less autobiographical, I think the heart of the work is always to share something about my experience with a reader—which is the same reason I read, to share in the experiences of others.Do you think poetry has any special tasks in our world right now? Are you drawn to poetry, or prose poetry, over other forms—fiction, essays—for reasons you can identify?  I think I’ve always been drawn to poetry in general over other forms of writing because of its capacity to do so much with so little.  Both as a writer and a reader, poetry gives me the opportunity to find new ways of looking at the world.  People become so consumed with such stupid stuff; we need more people who are looking for beauty and meaning in unlikely places.  I think that’s what a good poet does—uses language to open a part of us up to something we’ve never thought of before.Your writing is very accessible, which I appreciate. Sometimes these days “accessible” is a bad word in poetry, as if only the hard-to-understand stuff is really worth reading. And some poems are clearly not meant to mean in the usual ways, or not meant to mean at all. This is a big topic, but what are your thoughts on this as they pertain to Before OnStar? I find each poem quite subtle and provocative, along with its accessibility! When I was writing these poems I meant for them to seem accessible—meaning that they contained a story that was easily understood, but that there would be more under the surface if you went looking for it.  I had some grouchy people in writing workshops tell me they were too accessible and that they didn’t get the point.    I wanted to tell a story with these poems, not try to make people solve a riddle.  Personally, I find poems that are intentionally confusing pretentious and annoying.  Each time I read it, I am moved by “Us at Fifty.” Did you observe an actual couple walking hand in hand, eating peanuts, or did this happen in your imagination as you wrote? How did you know the poem was finished? I think the ending is perfect: “something must happen in the future that changes everything.”  I did observe this couple.  I was pulling into this seedy little grocery store and this couple was passing through the parking lot.  This doesn’t come through in the poem, but they both looked incredibly weathered—sunburnt, as if they walked everywhere.  I was struck by how happy they seemed to be together.   When you’re young you often get distracted by things that end up not mattering very much.  I think the poem used to end “or maybe they were just having a good day,” but that seemed too snarky for that moment.   Likewise, I was moved (and gasped!) at finding the book’s title quietly hidden inside “In Buick City.” Was Before OnStar always the working title of this chapbook? Or did you discover it as you were writing “In Buick City”?  Before Onstar was always the title of the chapbook.  I named my master’s thesis (in which a lot of these poems appeared) “Before Onstar,” as well as my portfolio that I wrote as an undergraduate.  In the poem “In Buick City” the phrase is used to describe the time that preceded the current situation in “Buick City”—one where a woman who has lived her whole life in that town is now afraid to go get groceries because some people have become desperate.  I always thought the phrase worked well to set up the poems as a collection.  Probably “After OnStar” is a more fitting title since all of the poems take place in the aftermath.  I find that Sarah Carson's Before OnStar evokes that whole \"before\" period in both Flint, Michigan and American culture, even while presenting the stark aftermath.  You can hear Sarah slinging her words with Wordslingers on WLUW at 88.7 FM in the Chicago area Sunday night, July 18, 8:00 p.m., or stream live at www.wluw.org."},

A very fine, spare prose style here--people and their behaviors acutely rendered.  People and their vulnerabilities gently exposed.  And there's a poetry reading in it.I don't think it is a spoiler to tell you 1) that The Grassy Knoll is a musical or 2) that the Trigilio feature looks at people who died (suspiciously, even if it looked like natural causes) during the conspiracy investigations into the JFK assassination.As a lover of coincidii, I just looked in the New York Times for a grassy knoll musical, which I vaguely remembered, but I was probably vaguely remembering a play by Tennessee Williams, recently mounted on Broadway with Elizabeth Ashley in it, not a musical.  Has there been a grassy knoll musical?  Someone let me know!This is yesterday's balsam, from the My Girls entry on Austen and Alcott, the A-list girls. Remember Wella Balsam?  Shampoo that smelled pretty good, like a forest, so I always got it confused with balsa wood, and model airplanes.  Farah Fawcett sold it with her popular hair.Anyway, balsam is that flower I told you about yesterday, and pictured above, also known as Touch-Me-Not, as I learned from my favorite wildflower book, Wild Flowers of North America, by Pamela Forey, which pretty much has everything in it, meticulously drawn in color by Norman Barber, Angela Beard, Susanna Stuart-Smith, and David Thelwell, all of Bernard Thornton Artists, London.\"Touch-Me-Not\" is perhaps the opposite message if you want to sell a nice shampoo, but it's possible Farah's hair had a lot of hairspray on it.

Most recently Sense and Sensibility, a new edition in hardcover, was in the window, plucked out by a woman who walked by, and off it went with her.By coincidence, Julie is following Austen with A Follow Spot today, too! How you can read her in her own hand!Today a young woman was in the shop with maybe her grandpa, who was helping her look for Little Women, by Louisa May Alcott. Hard to keep hold of that, too. But, as she had already read Little Women, she was thrilled to find another Alcott, My Girls. I've found the exact red cover, but I'm not finding much about what this particular book is, unless it brings together things from Aunt Jo's Scrapbook, where there is also a title, My Boys. Grandpa gave her money for My Girls, because he had bought her brother comic books down the street. So everybody was happy.Yes, when it rained, it poured today. And afterward, out came the sun again. Sarah got blooming balsam, something from Emily Dickinson's garden, at the Farmers Market. I got mine there earlier this season, and it is thriving!! Balsam is a perennial by way of delicate seed pods that burst open at a touch. Hence, its familiar name in some circles, Touch-Me-Not!"},

In specific, Judy is about to finish Settlers, Book 3, of what used to be a trilogy, and today bought Last Letter Home, Book 4 of the \"quadrilogy,\" so it will be ready and waiting.Arlene got Judy hooked by calling her up and telling her something Moberg had written (and I quote Judy quoting Moberg) about the sisters' ancestors' actual home area in Sweden, \"where the men are hot, and the women are hot under the skirt!\" (Judy's exclamation point!) Books 1 and 2 are called Emigrants and Unto a Good Land.So, you know, now I want to read about these Swedes!!And, in one of those freaky-deaky coincidii, today at work I handled a lovely book of poems by the Snell sisters, Cheryl Snell and Janet Snell, a poet and artist team. The book, Memento Mori, has beautiful color reproductions of Janet Snell's paintings. A few minutes later, taking a little work break, I visited Sherry O'Keefe's blog (clickable on the blog roll!), where she had just interviewed...Cheryl Snell of the Snell Sisters!!And now I am seeing Bing Crosby and Danny Kaye singing \"Sisters, Sisters\" in my head.

Here are some coincidii (and extrapolations) pertaining to To Kill a Mockingbird:1) A young woman in Babbitt's recently fondled and bought the lavender paperback edition of it, as reported in Nostalgic Potpourri.2) Kim recently pointed out the very same lavender edition in Border's, where we had gone for iced coffee.3) Seana just wrote about To Kill a Mockingbird in her blog!4) It is the 50th anniversary of To Kill a Mockingbird, with a new edition out echoing the cover of the first (pictured here).5) Harper Lee has been almost as silent as J. D. Salinger....(also a topic in this blog and an author in the women's book group I'm in).6) To Kill a Mockingbird was recently the book chosen by Chicago (and probably other cities) as the book for everyong to read that year.7) Calpurnia, a crucial character in To Kill a Mockingbird, is also the name of Julius Caesar's wife, which I know from playing Portia, who is Brutus's wife, in Shakespeare's Julius Caesar. Sigh... It's always all about me, isn't it?Anyhoo, I notice that the brief Amazon review of the book of essays by Mary McDonough Murphy, called Scout, Atticus, & Boo: A Celebration of Fifty Years of To Kill a Mockingbird, advises people to go back to the book itself, which is exactly what Ginny did, but it was the book of essays that inspired her to re-read the original!The essays are by Oprah Winfrey (who has done a heck of a lot for books with her book club), Alan Gurganus, Wally Lamb, Richard Russo, Tom Brokaw, and Roseanne Cash, among others.Further coincidii:8) Ginny was just in Babbitt's, making a fabulous literary collage from Things Found in Books,9) and so was Kim,which is how I got my information...I have to say it was amazing to watch adults get wrapped up in (go into a trance involving glue sticks) making bookmarks. Ginny said she was just encouraging someone else to make one, and then she got hooked. Kim came with kids, one of whom made 4 bookmarks in 5 minutes and then went back outside in search of free frisbees (me following as temporary shepherd), one of whom ignored her, getting wrapped up in the sports books aisle, while Kim herself rummaged through the box of things found in books.Ultimately, Kim and kids left...and Kim came back, alone, having safely deposited the children elsewhere, to work on her bookmark collage.I love people! I love books! I love bookmarks! I love collage!My mom made one, too. A poem collage. My mom rocks."},

Likewise, Marilynne Robinson, I will read Home, which we didn't pick because Kim has already read it. You too, Carol Shields, and Unless, which Kim and Janet had both already read. Most of us want to read something we haven't read before, unless 1) we tend to fall asleep reading at night, and find it hard to finish a book in the time allotted and/or 2) we are a very, very busy pastor off at a big wheely-deal, telling the Presbyterians to ordain gays and allow clergy to perform gay marriages. (The pastor is reading my old, used copy, which was at hand, and I am reading her new, orange copy, which arrived miraculously quickly from Amazon, in a small bulk order, and was left, by Kim, at my front door, between the glass and wood doors, on the 4th of July! So I am reading it now, cringing and laughing.) Hmm, I wonder if I will think of us now as the \"small bulk\" book group, the way I think of the local men's book group as the SOBs, because that's what they call themselves. One of the SOBs, conveniently named Dick, came into the bookshop yesterday, but he was not looking for dick lit. He was not looking for anything. He was waiting for his Polish sausages to cook down the street. But he bought a cool book on symbols.Anyway, Dick asked if I had read Olive Kitteridge yet because he wanted to discuss it with me, having just read it with the SOBs. I said I'd been waiting for a copy to come in, and he said a bunch would come in now, now that the SOBs are done with it. He's right!And Mary tells us, in a comment here (on perimenopause), that she has \"just started reading Jim Harrison's new collection of novellas called The Farmer's Daughter and it's wonderful. I read a review that described his protagonists as 'lusty' and that's exactly right! They are smart and capable and sexually charged. And the rural western landscape is lovely to imagine. Great summer read.\" (The SOBs also recently read some Harrison.)As I was telling Kim the other day, I like the idea of short stories or novellas for book group summer reading. People can read what pulls them, turn away from what doesn't, and we can discuss the one(s) we all have in common! Maybe in August!And now, since you are all waiting, my lantana is blooming and making its tiny blue-black poisonous berries, and re-blooming, thanks to the early rain, the long, hot week without rain, and its own life cycle. Don't worry, I am not going to make any tiny poisonous lantana berry pies.These are not my lantanas, by the way, but mine look a lot like them. So do the lantana along Linden Street, which used to have a lot of linden trees, including the one I grew up climbing, out on Linden Street Road, the rural extension of Linden Street, now, unromantically given an impossible-to-remember number, for emergency-services reasons. Linden trees are called lime trees in Isak Dinesen....No links today. I am cranky and lazy, thanks to terminal perimenopause."},
{"title": "Terminal Perimenopause", "date": "Thursday, July 8, 2010", "text": "Day 150 of the “What are you reading, and why?” project, and I am still reading Literary Feuds, by Anthony Arthur, where I have most recently completed the “cranky women” chapter on Lillian Hellman and Mary McCarthy, followed by the “cranky men” chapter on Truman Capote and Gore Vidal. Oh, my.Meanwhile, while I hope I don’t actually die from it, I am suffering from “terminal perimenopause,” a phrase I made up. It is based on “terminal adolescence,” a phrase I grew up on, uttered by my dad*, and “perimenopause,” an awkward term made up by medical professionals to describe that ongoing terrible transition to the real end of menses.Oh, I should have put up a TMI warning.Why did they call it “pause” in the first place? When we are in it, we want it not to pause, but to end.Peri-menopause. “Peri” as a prefix meaning “around” or “about” or “near.” “Menopause” meaning “the period of natural and permanent cessation of menstruation, usually occurring between ages 45 and 55”—who knew it would be all 10 years?!—and “pause” being a confusing word meaning “temporary cessation,” which is of course probably why they called it “menopause” in the first place and there is no need for the word “perimenopause.” Menopause already means the menses will stop and start, erratically, for a decade and drive the woman and anyone near her crazy.Pertinent here: Freya Manfred’s poems “The Husband Speaks of Menopause” and “The Wife Speaks of Menopause” from her book My Only Home, which I am also reading.Anyway, Lillian Hellman (1905-1984) was 75, sick, almost blind, and surely past menopause, when she got pissed off by something Mary McCarthy said in a television interview and sued her. McCarthy (1912-1989) was younger and terminally sarcastic when she said the mean things, and both of them had their reasons. I am amazed and admiring of author Anthony Arthur’s compassion and evenhandedness as he writes about these feuding literary types, but this is a case (literally, a legal case) in which, despite his respectful presentation of Hellman’s career and performance during the era of McCarthyism (interesting that two McCarthies—made-up plural—plagued Hellman), he comes down firmly on the side of McCarthy, who accused Hellman of lying.Apparently, she did lie. Or misrepresent the truth. I have read Pentimento, Hellman’s memoir, and seen the movie Julia, but it seems probable that Hellman took someone else’s story as her own in the “Julia” case, namely that of Muriel Gardiner. It’s all over now, the court case, the quibbling. Muriel Gardiner has told her own story. But why do people do this kind of thing? Insecurity, literary ambition, the yearning for some kind of power?The fiddling-with-truth seems always to have been an aspect of memoir, but also of history. Arthur points out that even the New Journalism, and Capote’s invented form, the “non-fiction novel,” were not really new, after all, just ways to label and market things. In Cold Blood.Anyway, Capote and Vidal were not suffering from perimenopause, just from spurts of mean-spiritedness, which could afflict any of us, perhaps, for various circumstantial, hormonal, and personality-based reasons. And both suffered from literary ambition, which seems the basis of most literary feuds. Sigh…Anyway, I have read The Group, by Mary McCarthy--happen to have a first Avon printing, I see, now that I work in a bookstore and notice such things—and Arthur’s book tells me it was based on a real group of women, her own “liberal intellectual set” (quoting Michiko Kakutani), the kind of thing that ultimately got Truman Capote in trouble, commenting on his own glamorous celebrity set. And not to call any of these writers lightweights (that’s the kind of thing they do), but I am glad I have paperback copies, due to my terminal lower back pain.Since I admit I never really grew up, but did get boobs and a period, it occurs to me that I have indeed gone from one painfully awkward long transition stage, terminal adolescence, to another awkwardly painful long transition stage, terminal perimenopause, and may well die of the two combined.*The phrase “terminal adolescence” was uttered by my dad, who attributed it to a friend, well before Kevin Leman wrote the book Adolescence Isn’t Terminal—It Just Feels Like It and long before Cheaper Than Therapy turned “Terminal Adolescence” into a song. Where did that phrase originate? Was it my dad’s buddy, as he claims?!But I’m pretty sure I just originated the phrase “terminal perimenopause.” Let’s see if it sticks. Meanwhile, I am happy to direct you to this blog on perimenopause, which turned up when I searched for the phrase and does seem pertinent. Oooh, and here's another! The Scandalous Women blog has an account of the quarrel!"},

Meanwhile, his kids were vocal about their own non-Seuss finds, and he eventually gave in and got 3 books, one for each child, including his \"inner child.\"And a young man bought 100 Years of Solitude, by Gabriel Garcia Marquez, a nostalgic favorite of mine, because people keep telling him to read it, so now he will. I love that book. I'm holding (well, now I'm typing, but I was holding) my mildly dampstained Avon Books paperback copy, 16th printing, in my cupped hands, as the lovers caress in their intense red and green jungle on the cover. Ah, 100 Years of Solitude. When I least expect it, the beautiful bald girl ascends to heaven in my mind.And last night, I grew nostalgic for books I don't even have yet!--a paradoxical emotion. Just arrived from Amazon, where it waited on my wishlist till I had saved up, is What Feeds Us, by Diane Lockward, a poet I enjoy every time I find her work in the journals. Finally, I have this book. But her latest, Temptation by Water, is just out, and now I lust after that one. I say \"lust\" appropriately, I think, as this book seems to be about desire! And water, where I feel at home. And I still desire another Lockward book, Eve's Red DressLikewise, I yearn for The Alchemist's Kitchen, by Susan Rich, which sits in my cart till I save up again for poetry! But these two wonderful poets have given us all a treat. Diane interviewed Susan in her own blog, Blogalicious, which you can click on my bloglist, and you can read the interview, a poem, a meditation on the poem, and hear Susan read another poem via a link to youtube! (Or you can click Susan's blog, The Alchemist's Kitchen, on the bloglist, and find her link to the interview. Ah, the wonders of technology. Which reminds me, I signed up for Goodreads but haven't done anything there since. Sigh....)Bloglists, aka blogrolls, are great. You see the latest entry, and they're so adorably clickable. Blogrolls sound edible."},

So far he is impressed by the bombardment of facts, including one he didn't know: some of our elected representatives used to be appointed. \"Think of the corruption!\" he said, pulling on his socks this morning. Then, revising his cynicism a tad, \"Think of the potential for corruption!\" (These were clean socks, but they will be sweaty later, as Tony was on his way to volleyball camp. Tomorrow is laundry day, which happens to coincide with garbage day in my household. Speaking of which, I cleaned up my office, and rearranged the book stacks, to impress my daughter, who has not yet noticed.) If he doesn't finish it in time, and can't renew it, maybe he will watch the upcoming Ken Burns documentary on prohibition. But I think he is really enjoying the reading, despite the tendency to fall asleep. (He's a hardworking, physical labor, volleyball coach of a man. Who likes a good Cuba libre at the end of the day.)But reading, to return to our main subject, is a pleasure all its own. To hold the book in hand, to concentrate, to look up and ponder, to re-read that last paragraph....to....zzzz.OK, but I, too, am interested in how the do-gooders and temperance ladies, together with the activists for women's suffrage (sometimes the same people), coincided with the powers that be (not, then, the women, but they were clearly gaining power) to produce legislation and an era, bound to be revoked, and residual good & ill. The dustjacket flap promises rich detail and the truth about Joseph P. Kennedy! And The Great Gatsby! And Dorothy Parker. Who is reading Dorothy Parker? Who is drinking bathtub gin?"},
{"title": "On the Media & On Math", "date": "Monday, July 5, 2010", "text": "Day 147 of the \"What are you reading, and why?\" project, and I'm glad to report that National Public Radio is rebroadcasting its \"Book It\" Series on On the Media. You can hear stories on the publishing industry, the future of reading, comparative reading, and innovations in reading. For all you aural learners and audioreaders, NPR is a wonderful thing.When I was teaching, we'd do essays on early reading experiences to make that connection between reading and writing, and, in some cases, try to figure out where it all went hooey, when they stopped loving reading. Main answer: when they had to read for school and write papers. So many students told me about their joyful library \"Book It\" programs--a different \"book it\"--with prizes including personal pizzas. I was always a happy youngster at the library, with no incentives but the reading itself. I would sometimes agonize over the choices, though, not wanting to be disappointed. Sometimes I yearned for something magical, fantastic, or scary. I was in second grade when I read a book of Alfred Hitchcock (was he the editor? did he write the intro?) stories when my parents went out and we had a babysitter. My mom warned me not to, but I did it anyway, and scared myself silly--then had to wait for them to get home to be comforted. Meanwhile, I was scared and, as the oldest, embarrassed.Today, continuing in the Anthony Arthur book Literary Feuds, I read about C. P. Snow and F. R. Leavis and the \"two cultures\" (science and literature) debate. Snow was a scientist and a novelist, and mainly a generalist. Leavis was an academic and literary critic, and a specialist. Snow was wildly popular and successful. Leavis was not, comparatively speaking, and was known for his sharp, witty, and pretty mean reviews.I had been pondering the \"two cultures\" thing--from the early 1960s--pretty recently--that is, in the 2000s--because a buddy in the Great Books biz had brought it up again, noticing that indeed many scientists he knows are rather well read in literature while the literary bunch is not very well read in the sciences. The science journalists and generalists and literary science types have done a lot to change that in recent decades, making many scientific concepts clear to lay people. Why can't we all get along? (Boy, would Leavis make fun of me!) It is so nice to be unimportant. No one will feud with me!Anyhoo, the science vs. humanities debate brings me to Taye, who is reading math. A big 3-volume set of mathematics essays, covering the history of mathematical thought and also special kinds of math. He told me that books 6 and 7 were intentionally left out of this fantastic set of writings when it was translated from Russian to English, and these are the books that make sense of everything. Why?! Why were these books left out?!Fortunately, they were later published in English in a journal, harder to find than the books. Taye says that you open most math books and see lots of numbers. Not these. These have words. He hated math as a kid in school. He says you have to force yourself to think in math ways, and once he did, he understood things better, everything. He saw connections. He teaches political science and thinking with math logic has changed his life and his teaching.Sigh.... But I do possess and have read around in Poetry of the Universe: A Mathematical Exploration of the Cosmos, by Robert Osserman. At Taye's urging, I will read around in it some more."},
{"title": "I Forgot a Title for This One", "date": "Sunday, July 4, 2010", "text": "Days 145 & 146 of the \"What are you reading, and why?\" project, and this is a two-for-one as it was not convenient to connect to the Internet yesterday (pool party, fireworks, Missouri). But it was convenient to chat with people about what they were reading, as I am wont to do.Morgan is reading the Temperance Brennan mystery series by Kathy Reichs, and is on book 5, which, thanks to Stop, You're Killing Me! I know to be Bare Bones. Yes, this is the character of the same name, but a completely different personality, according to Morgan, in the television series Bones. Morgan said most of the books have \"bones\" or \"dead\" in the title, the first book being Deja Dead, a catchy title, indeed. This is true, though one is called Fatal Voyage, another Monday Mourning, and another the particularly fun Grave Secrets. Morgan is reading these books \"for fun\" because during the school year she has 3 academic books going at a time as she pursues her masters degree in theology.Phileta is also reading a mystery this summer, one with gambling and baseball thrown in: The Mercy Rule, by John Lescroart. I link you to the hardcover because that's what Phileta found on top of her dresser when she cleaned it off for the first time in, and I quote, ten years, and that's why she is reading it now. It was indeed first published in 1998 and she got a stack of hardcovers for sale 10 years ago, put them on the dresser, and is just now getting to them. She read the first few pages of some of these books and if they didn't grab her, she set them aside. The Mercy Rule grabbed her.Her husband is doggedly making his way through the other hardcovers so it won't have been a waste of money."},
{"title": "Inside the Criminal Brain...for Life + 99", "date": "Friday, July 2, 2010", "text": "Day 144 of the \"What are you reading, and why?\" project, and I have a feeling some satisfied Babbitt's customer is reading Life Plus 99 Years, by Nathan F. Leopold, Jr, and introduced by Erle Stanley Gardner, author of the Perry Mason crime stories, because I can't find our Babbitt's copy on the search page....and it was a real deal compared to the ones I can find online.It was a 1974 reprint edition of the 1958 book by the convicted murder of Bobby Franks in the famous Leopold and Loeb case, where lawyer Clarence Darrow had them plead guilty, since they were, and made a famous speech that saved them from the death penalty. The judge sentenced them to \"life plus 99 years,\" which might have meant forever, but Richard Loeb was knifed in the shower and died in prison, and Nathan Leopold was paroled and evidently really did try to do some good things after the really bad thing of cold-blooded kidnapping and murder. Which he did after reading Nietzsche.It's the cold-blooded part I'm interested in here, and the structure of his brain, after hearing a fascinating story on NPR's Morning Edition, coming back from my morning swim. It's a special series called Inside the Criminal Brain, and in it researcher Jim Fallon discovers true crime in his own heritage and a black hole of remorselessness in his own brain.It's pretty freaky, but he's not disturbed, and neither is his wife, and neither is his mother, who is the one who suggested he look into his family history, on his father's side, in the first place! There are 3 main ingredients that lead to criminal behavior, says Fallon. One is brain structure, and one is genes, so he also looked at his immediate family's DNA. Again, he's got the freaky genes, the possible psychopath or sociopath genes.But, fortunately, he had a happy childhood. The 3rd ingredient is abuse or exposure to violence in childhood. The abused child who has icky brain patterns and icky DNA has a tough time ahead.One thing that confused me is that Fallon called this a \"young science\" when I know from handling other books that doctors and criminologists and people in law enforcement have been looking at the brain for years to discover tendencies of the criminal mind. Not to mention phrenologists! Anyhoo, new knowledge and new measurement techniques have no doubt produced new (young) theories, yet to be fully tested...but people have known from observation for a long time that some people tend toward criminality. It's interesting how what we know and what we assume and what we are allowed to study or to say...keep changing.And will continue to change, probably for life plus 99 years."},

Mysteries out the wazoo! She likes to collect a whole series before she starts reading, so she can read them in order without interruption or anxiety about finding the next one. She might read the first book from the library, but then she collects them at used bookstores, garage sales, and, as a last resort, new bookstores.Christine is very organized, with a big 3-ring notebook, color thumbtabs, labels, and checkmarks. She is helped in her process by the fabulous mystery book website, Stop, You're Killing Me!--\"a website to die for...if you love mysteries!\" You can click the alphabet to find an author or a main character, and find the series listed in order, etc. So go to that link for any authors or series I mention here! (Well, I will provide a few links for clarity.)Like Jo, who labeled these \"cozy mysteries,\" Christine prefers \"light, fun\" mysteries, where everything works out in the end and nothing is too dark. She read all of Patricia Cornwall, but ultimately Cornwall \"got too serious\" for her. She is not reading Stieg Larsson's Millennium Triology!She also does not like the Magoddy series by Joan Hess, though she has all 20 books, collected because she liked the first series, with Claire Molloy as a bookstore owner! When she's done with a series, she sells it or trades it for another, or, if she likes it, sends it on to her mom, also a mystery reader.One of Christine's favorite authors is Nancy Martin, who writes about the Blackbird Sisters, starting with How to Murder a Millionaire.I have to say I am very impressed with Christine's organizational system, including book storage. She has an armoire with the rod taken out, stuffed with books, in bags, labeled.This is the opposite of me. I have bookshelves, yes, but also stacks on the floor that prompted my daughter to say, \"Why is it a mess?!\" when she walked into my otherwise neat office last night. At least my poetry bookcase is alphabetical, now with chapbooks removed and stored in baskets so they don't get squeezed by bigger books, or slip behind them when books are moved. And also to protect the ribbons on the spines of some of them! We don't want any poetry chapbooks to cry, \"Stop, you're killing me!\"Be careful out there. Don't get stuffed in an armoire."},
{"title": "Emily, Ender, and Xenocide Coincide", "date": "Wednesday, June 30, 2010", "text": "Day 142 of the “What are you reading, and why?” project, and Emily is reading Xenocide, the third book in the Enders Quartet by Orson Scott Card, after getting hooked on the series when her mom listened to the first book, Enders Game, on audiobook. Emily then found the book at a bookstore in California.You know I love coincidii, and today a young woman at Babbitt’s bought Enders Game, and we chatted about it, and tonight Emily sent her reply to my “Why?” question at Facebook....and now it is tomorrow and I am posting this, via time travel.The woman in the store was buying a copy because she didn’t have one, although she had already read and loved the book. “It’s a cool story for middle school boys!” she said. “And then, when you read it again when you are a little older, you see that it is a commentary on life.” She called it a combination of science fiction and religion.Emily concurs. Here is her summary, in her own words (condensed so I don’t give too much away!):Orson Scott Card is most noted for his science fiction work, but also writes in other genres, and is an advocate and activist for the Mormon Church (I'm far from being Mormon philosophically, by the way). This is according to his Wikipedia entry. I haven't read anything outside of the Ender Quartet.In the first book, Andrew, who goes by Ender, after attending and being indoctrinated in battle school, blows up a whole alien species (the \"buggers\") with several of his former classmates and proteges, thinking he is playing a game. When Ender travels to another planet, he has a revelation that what he did was wrong, and the buggers were no longer a threat to human life when he blew them up. He writes a story about it, and signs it \"Speaker for the dead\", which then turns into a whole religion and philosophy.In the second book, Speaker for the Dead, it's 3000 years later, and due to side effects from space travel, Ender and his sister, Valentine, have only aged into their 30's. We find out here that Ender has go to by Andrew, since everybody hates Ender now. They call what he did a \"xenocide\", since he killed off an entire alien species, or so they think.A new alien species has been discovered, called, by lay people, \"piggies\". Piggies live on a planet chronically [besieged] by a microbe called the descolada. It's fatal to humans, but… piggies don't understand that, for humans, death is permanent. Toward the end, a revolt happens, where two xenologists (somebody who studies alien life) end up interfering too much with the piggies,… and Andrew starts coming out as both the original speaker for the dead and Ender.I'm on the third book now, Xenocide. Ender and Valentine are now in their sixties. The starways congress, an intergalactic version of the United Nations, has decided to blow up the planet the piggies live on, and a taoist teenager named Gloriously Bright, along with Ender/Andrew and his crew, are struggling to find out what to do separately. Gloriously doesn't know Ender and his friends personally (and vice versa) yet.Gosh, I hope what I said was clear.Emily was quite clear and I hope my edits don’t mess that up! I am now a little scared of buggers and piggies, and the frightening pun of “xenocide.” And, as I told the young woman yesterday/today (time travel challenged here) in the bookstore, I think you would like The Sparrow, by Mary Doria Russell, Emily, and its sequel, Children of God—science fiction, comparative religion, cultural anthropology!And, by further coincidence, I was just listening to the Beatles song with \"piggies\" in it, who sound like \"biggies\" in some of the refrain. Clearly, the Beatles were time travelers, too.Futuristically, the Ender series has gone beyond 4 books now...."},

The same group also discussed sections of the Fagles translation of The Odyssey, too, or we were going to, as I have a copy of it, as well as a copy of the Robert Fitzgerald translation...or they did, and I didn't get to that meeting. Anyway, the great myths persist inside me.And inside my kids, too, thanks to re-tellings of all the great myths and Bible stories...on The Simpsons. Sigh.... The Simpsons also provides my kids' main contact with the great musical comedies of my youth. Double sigh....(for youth and musical comedy).Speaking of revisiting, I finally managed to create a \"blog roll,\" or blog list, in my case, since I am using an older editor at Blogger, as I learned through trial and repeated error. (A funny thing happened on the way to the blog list.....Triple sigh... Anyhoo!)Under the Blog Archive list of past entries is a list of Blogs I Love to Visit, which will appear in the order of the most recent posting. There are other blogs I love to visit, and others I follow, but some are highly specialized, some are more private or family-oriented, and some I just haven't added yet.You can click the latest entry in a blog on this list and get a new window! Different from clicking the links here, which take you away and you have to click the back button to...get back. (Beatles song!)

This is the book that so many people are reading that it stays in hardcover. (Or large print paperback, kindle, and audiobook. The trade paperback will be out in January, 2011.)Yes, we had chocolate pie. Plus Cool Whip and berries. Green chips and salsa. Biscuits and home made strawberry jam.  And Beer Nuts Party Mix (\"a party in your mouth\"), leftover from the Saturday night party.What a beautiful evening on the patio. Breezy and warm, clear skies, puffy clouds, it gradually got dark around us as we talked about the book and the natural other things that arose from it. It was the perfect blend of book talk and related-to-the-book talk that was free to go anywhere. It felt like everybody got to say what she wanted to say about the book, and we got to hear about personal experiences or ethical or moral dilemmas similar to those faced by characters in the book. Interpretive discussion and a connected personally-resonant discussion.I know that many, many book groups are mere excuses for social gatherings, and people sometimes 1) don't talk about the book and/or 2) don't even read the book. But we are a lucky bunch. Susan, our fearless leader, formed the group because 1) she wants to read fiction (or, OK, occasionally memoir!) and 2) her other book group was not actually reading the book.Tonight we had a new member, Suzie, who had come to us as a haven because her previous book group was...well, it was Susan's previous book group! (I hope I am not exposing anybody! Uh...I think we are safe.) Anyway, we discussed the book, which, I hear, is remarkably rare in book groups these days!Any comments about book groups welcome here.The images today are collage bookmarks made by me from things found in books, glued to the backings for Swedish cooking utensils. On the left is a collage poem made from lines from other poems cut from pages of an anthology cut out from an old (but abundant, not rare) book, so the inside could be used to put something else (not a gun) in. On the left is an art collage, with ironic content, to be used as a large bookmark. Bookmarks are things found in books! So are newspaper clippings, brochures, playing cards, seed packets, greeting cards, CTA (Chicago Transit Authority) courtesy/complaint cards, etc.I love bookmarks, I love crafty doo-dads, and I love collage poems."},

I saw the Dragon Tattoo film Friday night, and really liked how it cut out extraneous information (and love affairs) and focused on the central characters. It also brought in a bit of plot from the other books, a sort of foreshadowing.It really is a kind of wildfire, this series. I heard about it first from people in the bookstore looking for it maybe before Christmas, then from a friend in January. Then at a party in February, the hosts were reading it, and about every week since, I've run into someone who is reading it, which is why I finally did, to see what all the hoopla is about. I wonder if the hoopla is partly because of the untimely death of the author.Judy is reading Mohawk, by Richard Russo, because she loved Bridge of Sighs. I love Russo, and so do my parents, who were the ones who told me about Nobody's Fool. I gave Straight Man to my chair when I left an English Department! Party girl Lynn also enjoyed Straight Man. I am way behind on my Richard Russo and must head to the library! The last Russo I experienced was The Whore's Child and Other Stories, on audiobook in my parents' car on a road trip to Ohio, and it made me check out the book from the library to read them all, after hearing a few. On Judy's to-read stack is the E. L. Doctorow book Homer & Langley, a novel based on the real-life Collyer brothers, famous for hoarding stuff in their brownstone on 5th Avenue in New York, living there, and dying there, having retreated from the world into their own world. Why?! Kristi is reading The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society, by Mary Ann Shaffer and Annie Barrows, because it was a Christmas gift. On her to-read stack is John Irving's Last Night in Twisted River, because she loves Irving, as do so many people I talk to, including me (yes, I talk to myself!). Kristi also recently enjoyed reading the Nanny Diaries, by Emma Mclaughlin and Nicola Kraus, recommended by party girl Judy, who had witnessed the kind of thing in the novel when she managed a building of fancy condominiums.Kristi also enjoyed, if that's the right word for a surreal novel about a vague crime, Invitation to a Beheading, by Vladimir Nabokov, which she got for $1 on a library sale book cart!! When Kristi described it to me, it sounded like Kafka, and I see that the mini-reviews at Amazon do refer to The Castle. Yay for library book sales! And yay for libraries and interlibrary loan, which Lynn thanks for the chance to read The Avengers, by Rich Cohen, and The Looming Tower, by Lawrence Wright. Lynn said Cohen was someone who grew up hearing that Jewish people did not fight back during World War II, but then met and interviewed a number of Jewish resistance fighters, the \"avengers,\" for this book. She hopes everyone will read The Looming Tower: Al Quaida and the Road to 9/11, a Pulitzer Prize winner, so we can better understand what is really going on with Islamic terrorism, and Osama bin Laden in particular.In thanking the Chicago Public Library for the opportunity to read these books, Lynn also shared the news that there's a tiny CPL branch now in the actual downtown Water Tower, along with a tiny Hot Tix booth, and a tiny, but very, very good coffeeshop!"},

Under the dome at the Temple de Pentemont 106 rue de Grenelle 75007 Paris, some kind of numerical alchemy/performance art. Today, Saturday, June 26.Somehow this is related to the official opening of the Shanghai World’s Fair, even though it officially opened in May. If you understand it, please explain it to me.Mallarme is connected to Jean Verlaine as a Symbolist poet, and to Charles Baudelaire, who gave us prose poetry. Verlaine and Arthur Rimbaud are passionate and brutal in the film Total Eclipse, very hard to watch, but watch it I did, putting together stuff for a Literature and Film class on how writers are depicted in feature film.*And they are linked in this Bob Dylan lyric from “You’re Gonna Make Me Lonesome When You Go”:Situations have ended sadRelationships have all been badMine’ve been like Verlaine’s and RimbaudBut there’s no way I’d compareAll those scenes to this affairYou’re gonna make me lonesome when you goI am hearing it sung by Madeleine Peyroux, though, not Bob Dylan.And that’s all I’ve got for you today, because I am off to 1) a poetry reading and 2) a slumber party.

{"title": "Caliban as a Fiddler Crab, Moral Beauty", "date": "Friday, June 25, 2010", "text": "Day 137 of the “What are you reading, and why?” project, and today is a hodge-podge, potlatch, tie-up-the-loose-ends-of-random-coincidii-collage entry that I thought of entitling “Caliban as a Fiddler Crab, Moral Beauty, and a Boob Job,” but it would have made an awkward, unwieldy header and might have attracted unwelcome email messages.Recently I blogged on Oscar Wilde who mentioned Caliban in the preface to The Picture of Dorian Gray, and Walter Pater, who spoke of moral beauty in a preface to Dorian Gray. Suddenly last night I got to see Caliban under the stars in The Tempest at the Illinois Shakespeare Festival!Babbitt’s Books staff were invited to opening night, as we created a bookcase of Shakespeare books for their gift shop, and we offer a discount to actors, crew, and staff who visit the store! I saw one of our customers, who had just been in, and who said he, too, had just suddenly been invited, and wished he’d had a chance to read it first. “You can read it now,” I suggested, “and have this production fresh in your mind!” We both loved the circle of blue sky with clouds on the floor, on the back of the set, and on Ariel’s back, that blue-bodied spirit!Each time I see a production of Shakespeare, I love to see what will come through most vividly to help me understand a particular element of the play I’ve not understood with my whole body and soul before, even if I “understood” it intellectually or had it explained to me in a class or by a critic. That is, what does the particular production make available to me and to everybody else in the audience, whether or not we all respond to it, or interpret it exactly the same way?I’ve mentioned the blue sky with clouds aspect of the set (which corresponded to the actual weather yesterday: blue sky, puffy white clouds, transforming gradually into gorgeous clear night, nearly full moon, scatter of stars and lightning bugs) and I’d like to mention that two stairways moved from brown below to blue above as they approached the actor balcony and the ethereal realm. But there was also that circle of sky mirrored on the floor!Caliban—half human, half monster—was marvelous, blotched, and fishy, with a golden fiddler crab-like claw on one hand. He touched me deeply when he spoke to the human visitors about the music of the spheres, the celestial music of the spirits—Ariel and his blue band—that he hears all around him as a matter of course, and which stuns and frightens and delights the humans hearing it for the first time. This Caliban also moved me in his pleas to Prospero. “I loved you,” recounting the early attentiveness Prospero gave him. Then, human monster that he was, Caliban lusted after Miranda, or that is Prospero’s excuse, anyway, for the withdrawal of love from Caliban…gave me pause!I was moved, too, by Ariel, in service to the magical Prospero, enslaved, enthralled…. Ariel does everything he is asked, in return for his freedom. (I am reminded of the blue genie in Disney’s Aladdin.) And Ariel teaches Prospero a deeper compassion. Ariel would feel something for these dreadful suffering humans “if I were human,” he says! Gives Prospero pause, and helps him access his own empathy and forgiveness.Then, deeply touching, Ariel is free. The actor’s body takes in the reality of that, the loss of Prospero as master, friend, and companion on the island, and then, deeply satisfied, runs off, free! There is no sentimental, out-of-character hugging. He’s just gone!And Prospero, now truly humbled, even wiser than before, with only his human powers, asks for our hands in the traditional epilogue. And we applaud.So what came through for me this time was that compassion and forgiveness are sweeter than revenge, that we ought to love our monstrous flawed selves, that we ought to behave responsibly and with love (both Caliban and Prospero learn this lesson!), and that our human selves are enough on this earth. We can let our spirits run free.So, some coincidii:The Babbitt’s bookcase in the ISF gift shop now displays my first poetry chapbook, Selected Roles (Moon Journal Press, 2006), which contains poems in the voices of several Shakespearean characters, including Miranda! I was in the Illinois Shakespeare Festival way back in 1981! (Selected Roles is also on the local authors shelf, and online, at Babbitt’s—always only $5!)Caliban as a fiddler crab reminds me of Fiddler Crab Review, a marvelous online blogazine dedicated to reviewing chapbooks, old and new!I have a chapbook by Susan Slaviero, who tells you what she is reading frequently in her blog, Mythology and Milk.Likewise, Sarah Sloat in the rain in my purse. People keep telling me they loved what she said in the little interview I posted here, to time with a review of her chapbook, In the Voice of a Minor Saint (Tilt Press, 2009), at Prick of the Spindle, and they want more interviews with poets! So I will try to accommodate.On that, I am thinking I might review/interview here in the blog if you to send me your poetry book or chapbook c/o Babbitt’s, so let me check with my boss about that. I would like to receive the book at the bookstore, have the option of reviewing it here or at the bookstore blog, and also have the option of keeping it, passing it on to a poet friend, or selling it gently used at the bookstore so a poet who can’t afford it new can afford it used, so it gets another reader, and so the boss can receive a bit of economic return for housing it, and for listing it online at the store database. Your thoughts on this?Likewise, that would carry on the spirit and tradition of my reviews at RHINO, and I am waiting to hear whether they want me to do something similar again for them!And what about the boob job? OK, I am now reading The Girl Who Played With Fire, by Stieg Larsson, having finished The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo in time to see it tonight at the local theatre, and somebody gets a boob job. Why?! There is a reason, but I am dubious about it, and don’t want to be a spoiler, etc., but it is making me think hard about how much of the trilogy is truly devoted to feminism, and how much is sex-sells-and-makes-for-a-blockbuster-movie-version. So I send you to Seana’s blog entry on another book, using the Steig Larsson phenomenon as a contrast. Much to ponder!And, finally, one of our Babbitt’s customers yesterday was the woman who ran the spotlight for The Tempest last night! And Julie Kistler was in the opening-night audience, too, to review the production for her blog, A Follow Spot! (Don't know if her review is up yet, but it will be, and there's plenty of fun stuff to read in her blog!)"},
{"title": "Courage, Redemption, and Pee", "date": "Thursday, June 24, 2010", "text": "Day 136 of the \"What are you reading, and why?\" project, and Mary is reading The Bedwetter by Sarah Silverman, who is very, very funny. The subtitle is Stories of Courage, Redemption, and Pee, and I am a little afraid to read it...in case I laugh so hard I pee.A couple days ago, Nene commented that I was \"erudite and cerebral.\" I bet he doesn't think so now.Here is an example of Silverman's book marketing, at Amazon:Dear Reader: My name is Sarah Silverman. I was once primarily known for saying the word \"poop\" and getting paid above market rates for it. But those days are over, because I am now going to be known for having written a book. Why did I write a book, you might wonder? Because it just seemed like the right time to be getting into the publishing industry. I'm kidding. Publishing is rotting like an abandoned possum carcass on the shoulder of I-95. I know that for a fact, because shortly after my book deal was announced, I kept hearing people lament the imminent demise of literature. These days there is only one reason to write a book: to be taken seriously. And that is exactly what is about to happen to me. I'm an author now! Like Ernest Hemingway and Fyodor Dostoevsky! When I was asked to provide text for an author page, I decided to approach it in a scholarly manner, because that's what authors do. I looked to other author pages for inspiration, and I learned so much. For example, while Hemingway and Dostoevsky do not have their own author pages on Amazon.com, Paris Hilton does.See, doesn't that want to make you read the book?  And Sarah Silverman does have her own Author Page.  Interesting to learn that she struggled with depression, in addition to the bedwetting thing.  Funny people are so often funny with sadness in the background.As the summer reading catalogue continues, I'll mention some books people are reading now that other people were reading earlier:Ron--Contested Will: Who Wrote Shakespeare? by James S. ShapiroDavid--Olive Kitteridge by Elizabeth StroutJudy--The Anthologist by Nicholson BakerMelissa--A Widow for One Year by John IrvingLisa--Last Night in Twisted River, also by John IrvingI'm pretty sure those books have some courage, redemption, and pee in them, too."},
{"title": "The Picture of Dorian Gray", "date": "Wednesday, June 23, 2010", "text": "Day 135 of the \"What are you reading, and why?\" project, and Kim K* is reading The Picture of Dorian Gray, by Oscar Wilde, because Ivan Albright made her do it!\"First I should explain,\" said Kim K, \"that in this case I'm 'reading' it via audiobook.\"\"Aauugghh,\" I replied, since I am focusing on reading books in print in this blog, curious about the concentration and thought processes involved in reading from the page, rather than through the ear....Interestingly, Kim K's experience applies!\"I have to say that being nearly through it now, I'm likely to go follow up by reading it in print soon. It's compelling, and I'm really enjoying a lot, but I inevitably feel that I miss some things in audiobooks, and I think I want to take it at my own pace as well. (That said, I also think audio makes some parts easier, especially when it's well read, as this one is.)\"So, there are probably 3 reasons why I picked it:\"(1) Circumstance: I need audiobooks for my auto commute, which is why I was looking in the first place. I'm backed up a mile and a half with print books** waiting to be read, but that 35-90-minute commute demands audiobooks.\"(2) It's a classic, and I don't believe I've actually read any Oscar Wilde before.\"(3 - and I really think this is the main reason) I have loved Ivan Albright's painting by the same name in the Art Institute for years and years and years. It's probably one of the first things I ever fell in love with there, right along with the Monets. I could sit for hours and look at it, and never tire of it. I love Albright's painting in general, and this is absolutely one of my favorites. An utterly astonishing painting. If the book could inspire that, then it had to be worth reading.\"In the Wonderful Land of CoincidOz that is my mind and this book blog, I handled a copy of The Picture of Dorian Gray at the bookstore yesterday, a volume in the Connoisseur's Edition of Wilde's Collected Works, introduced by Coulson Kernahan with a preface by Walter Pater.  Both Kernahan and Pater praise Wilde for his geniality and generosity as a person, and wit and beauty as a writer.Pater also says Wilde carries on \"the brilliant critical work of Matthew Arnold,\" referring I think to pursuing \"sweetness and light\" as the aim of a culture, beauty over function, intangible values over utilitarianism.  This also fits with Bertrand Russell's sound bite (who knew Russell and \"sound bite\" would ever be in the same sentence?) at the end of that youttube clip (previous ungodly entry) saying we should value what is true, not just what is useful.  (Hmmm.  Pay no attention to the man behind that curtain.  Arf, arf!  What is it, Toto?)  In his own aphorism collage preface to Dorian Gray, Wilde says, \"All art is quite useless.\"  And, coincidOzally, in another volume of that same Collected Works, Wilde comments on Pater's Imaginary Portraits.Anyhoo!  The Picture of Dorian Gray is a compelling \"horror\" story, adapted for film a jillion times, about a man who sells his soul to retain his youth and beauty, but, as literature, cliche, and Bertrand Russell might tell him, the truth will out.  Ivan Albright \"outs\" it wonderfully.  Albright's portrait is used in the 1945 film version.The horror is not just supernatural but also psychological, and, as Pater argues, moral.  Pater says that Wilde's heroes tend \"to lose the moral sense\" and thus \"to become less complex, to pass from a higher to a lower degree of development.\"  So, even in the world of art-for-art's-sake, beauty is not merely aesthetic.  There is moral beauty.  Sigh.  My brain hurts.Oh, I know!  Wilde can help me out.  Here are some of the aphoristic claims in his preface:Those who find beautiful meanings in beautiful things are the cultivated. For these there is hope.  They are the elect to whom beautiful things mean only beauty. There is no such thing as a moral or an immoral book. Books are well written, or badly written. That is all.The nineteenth century dislike of realism is the rage of Caliban seeing his own face in a glass.The nineteenth century dislike of romanticism is the rage of Caliban not seeing his own face in a glass. The moral life of man forms part of the subject-matter of the artist, but the morality of art consists in the perfect use of an imperfect medium. Here, in the 21st century, in my little town, and my Wonderful Land of CoincidOz, I can go see Caliban rage in The Tempest at the Illinois Shakespeare Festival this summer.  Under the stars.OK.  *Kim K is not the Kim addicted to hummus, at Hummus Anonymous.  **I hope Kim K will tell us what's in her stack of print books, maybe giving us a list like Doug's List!

E. Hinton book, Hawkes Harbor. We have a signed first edition at Babbitt's, and I think she just wanted to sit in the sun somewhere and read it, and it's often best not to spill beverages and sunscreen on signed first editions. I didn't even know Hinton had written this horror novel for adults--I see we have it in general fiction at Babbitt's, not in horror, but hey. And I see that Elizabeth Hand, who reviewed it for the Washington Post, did not like it much and compares it to an Ed Wood movie.But Hand admired Hinton's young adult novels, and I did love The Outsiders, Rumblefish, Tex, etc., which would all be good poolside reading.And there is a mass of 5 or 6 handsome young men--hard to tell how many as they move, well, en masse--that come into the bookstore regularly, and chat in various aisles--lots of time in the literary fiction aisle, lots of time in the science aisle. Yesterday I noticed tans, black shorts, red shirts; they smiled, etc. I was not the one at the register when they bought their summer reading selections, so I can't tell you what they are reading, but it always quietly thrills me how much these guys like books.I promise that reading is the source of the quiet thrill."},
{"title": "Godly & Ungodly & the Summer Solstice", "date": "Monday, June 21, 2010", "text": "Day 133 of the \"What are you reading, and why?\" project, and Sarah is reading Why I Am Not a Christian, by Bertrand Russell. Meanwhile, Bob is reading The Case for God, by Karen Armstrong. They can strongarm,* or arm wrestle, each other!Sarah says, \"Unlike many vociferously off-putting secularists or atheists, he's gentle in his critiques. I like his calmness and rationality in addressing arguments and tenets of the Christian faith. He's also quite honest about the fact that Jesus said and did good things, but at the same time, he doesn't acknowledge that Jesus was the wisest man who ever lived. I find it a refreshing and enjoyable read.\"She also provides this interesting youtube clip from an interview with Russell that shows his gentleness as well as his firm dismissal of \"nonsense\" and what is merely useful, but not true:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrxSkc68Ci0*The \"strongarm\" humor above is not meant to make light of a terribly serious situation--when advocates of one religion strongarm believers in other religions, or nonbelievers. Russell even suggests at the end of this little video that some believers would lie--strongarm the truth--about some nonbelievers' supposed deathbed conversions. That gave me some pause.Meanwhile, Bob appreciates Armstrong for being such \"an excellent scholar and writer.\" I was fascinated by her accounts of life in the convent, and her decision to renounce her vows and do her search-for-God work in the secular world in her books Through the Narrow Gate and The Spiral Staircase: My Climb Out of Darkness. The latter uses T. S. Eliot's spiral staircase image from Ash Wednesday. She has a bunch of thick books on a number of religions that I yearn to read!And today is the Summer Solstice, celebrated by pagans! No, really, it is a \"pre-Christian\" fertility holiday, honored and celebrated in various ways, as well as an astronomical event! Some of us love the longest day of the year, the stretching out of sunlight, and some of us welcome the shift back from sunlight to gradual darkness, as we move toward the Winter Soltice.But right now, some of us are still deeply engrossed in our summer reading, some of it godly, some of it ungodly. Krystal is reading The Time Traveler's Wife, by Audrey Niffenegger. Maria is reading Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde by Robert Louis Stevenson, and Brave New World, by Aldous Huxley, with her son, joining him in his summer reading assignments. Susan is reading The Sparrow, by Maria Doria Russell, having discovered it here! (And I know she will want to read the sequel, Children of God, as soon as she's done!) And Rebecca is reading The Little Stranger, by Sarah Waters, a ghost story.So, whether you enjoy the natural or the supernatural, and whether you are godly or ungodly, happy summer solstice, and happy summer reading."},
{"title": "Last Child in the Woods (on Father's Day)", "date": "Sunday, June 20, 2010", "text": "Day 132 of the \"What are you reading, and why?\" project, and Lisa is reading The Last Child in the Woods, by Richard Louv, about nature-deficit disorder.  I've linked you to his website, where you can learn more about him, the book, and the Children and Nature Network, which helps get kids back outside. I'm so glad the book has got people thinking and talking about this, about how kids would be healthier and happier with more outdoor play, and truly immersed in nature.  I understand parents' fears these days about letting kids run loose--our American society seems much less safe than when I grew up--but I had not considered an aspect mentioned in the Scientific American review of the book: kids have less access to some land due to landowners' fear of lawsuits.  Sigh...We moved from a big city to a small town in part so our kids could be freer and more independent, and get out there on their bikes and play in the park with their friends, and they do, or did, for a time, age appropriately, but my kids, like a lot of kids, are also wrapped up in electronic media, and find it more exciting that the slower pace of how things grow.  They tolerate my little tours of the yard to point out what's blooming now.  But they do still like walking or biking on the trail, and things are growing and blooming there, birds are nesting, etc.But here's a strange development: my son prefers produce from the grocery store to something straight from the ground because 1) it has dirt and 2) bugs were on it.  Egad!  If I explain that the grocery store food was also in the ground and probably bugs were on it, he just won't eat any fruit or vegetables at all.  \"This stuff is picked ripe,\" I can say about food from the Farmers Market or the grandparents' garden, and \"We have mint growing in our own back yard!\" but there is still resistance.  When I stress how we don't use herbicides and pesticides in our yard, so the mint is really clean, he'll just say, \"Yeah, no pesticides, so bugs were on it.\"  Sigh...Just last night at a Father's Day dinner out, my husband and the kids were talking about camping.  (They've been talking about it for years, not actually doing it.  I haven't been camping since the Appalachian Trail, before kids.  Have I sighed lately?  Anyhoo!)  I've got news for my kids: there will be bugs!My neighbor's kids love bugs and recently hatched and released a zillion praying mantises into the yard.  I took one (or a few, they were crawling on me) home to our yard, too, and I remember how awed my kids were each time we'd find a praying mantis or walking stick in the back yard here, in our postage stamp yard in Chicago, or visiting friends in Michigan, with hummingbirds!  Yes, there is still wonder and delight in nature, and I hope my kids will stay open to it.And now, because it's Father Day, I'll tell a little story my dad tells about searching for my brother Jeff in the woods in Florida.  We had the run of the neighborhood in Gainesville, but we weren't supposed to go into the woods alone, as there were various dangers.  Quicksand, for one.  Barbed wire (at the edge of privately-owned land, I realize as a grown up, but we were climbing through it as kids.)  We had gone on family hikes, though, so Jeff and his friend knew where they were headed on that shared tricycle.  To the woods, the creek, an adventure! But Jeff and Kenny did not return when called, so off the dads went on a search.  And then, high up on a ridge, my dad looked down on a tricycle submerged in the creek, no sign of two little boys, and came the awful way home, heart pounding, to start the next stage of the search.And there they were, safe, afraid to speak of the lost tricycle, but not sucked down by quicksand."},
{"title": "Sarah J. Sloat--Minor Saint, Major Talent", "date": "Saturday, June 19, 2010", "text": "Day 131 of the \"What are you reading, and why?\" project, and I have been reading and re-reading In the Voice of a Minor Saint, by Sarah J. Sloat, because I have loved her poems when I read them individually in print and online magazines and in order to review it for Prick of the Spindle, an online literary and art magazine. The new issue is just out, Sloat has new poems in it, and it's all around wonderful.In the Voice of a Minor Saint was published by Tilt Press, and you can see other reviews of it and their other chapbooks at the Tilt blog. The fabulous cover art is by Emmanuel Polanco. Sarah posts poems or links, neat images, and fascinating observations in her blog, the rain in my purse.Because Sarah lives in Germany, I have never met her, but I asked her some questions and she kindly answered them. (I'm bold, she's saintly!)The title of the book makes me ask, “Are you the minor saint?” Do you speak as a saint in some way—someone quietly going about her humble business in service of something mysterious and huge? Likewise, the title poem, “In the Voice of a Minor Saint,” makes me wonder if the speaker is a real or imagined “minor saint” from Catholicism, or someone similar to you? Or both.I’m not Catholic but I think the saints are adorable. They all start out small, and then inflate. The minor saint is probably a projection, and I am him/her insofar as I’m called on every day to remember my insignificance. It’s a good thought - it staves off despair and generally makes life a lot easier.I love the lines, “My heart is small, like a love/ of buttons or black pepper.” That couplet has a perfection to it, and I identify with it. How did you find that couplet?I was under the impression that that couplet had been part of the first draft of the poem, but I went looking through my notebooks and it wasn’t. It crept in gradually. In the first instance black pepper was ground pepper, which is obviously wrong. Along with the saints I like their inventories: hailstones, teeth, horses, boats, the peanut crop. I decided on a couple things small and manageable, but important in their particular ways.Tell me about how you handle speakers in general. And specifically, in “Europa.”I wish I could do speakers better. I rarely set out to put words in someone’s mouth. In most of my poems in some way it is “me” talking. In “Europa,” the speaker gives voice to the frustration I’ve often felt having to listen to how great Old Europe is, and how it’s the root of anything good in America. Ideas like New York is European. Woody Allen is European. Tom Waits is European. Oh, come ON!Tell me about the construction of “Naked, Come Shivering.” I see all the notes at the end, references to other poets, so I assume it’s a collage poem.“Naked, Come Shivering” is a cento, or collage poem. I am a huge lover of modern French poetry. The Random House anthology 20th Century French Poetry is my plastic Jesus. Pierre Reverdy, Robert Desnos, Guillaume Apollinaire, etc., etc. My cento is a love letter to them. I had another cento published in DMQ called “Quite At Home” that also took its lines from the French. You pretty much can’t go wrong with them.Tell me, too, how you came to write ghazals and why you like that form.My first interest in ghazals came from reading Lorca’s gacelas, which are ghazals, if not in the strict form most people are familiar with. His “Gacela of the Dark Death” is one of my favorite poems. It has a rich, dark strangeness to it, and a weariness. I think of it often.I’ve written a number of ghazals. It looks like an easy form and in a way it is, but it’s hard to write a good ghazal because there’s a certain monotony built in – the reader knows how every couplet is going to end. It’s a challenge to keep it surprising and engaging and have it hang together. What I find most appealing is how each couplet can be its own poem – that gives the poet focus.I was at RHINO when we took the poem “The Silent Treatment,” but I loved your whole submission, wanted to take others as well, and have recognized other poems from it, I’m pretty sure, when I see them in other journals—for instance, “Tinder Box,”* the crayon poem in Apparatus. Tell me about your submission process—how you decide to send what where, if/when you revise after rejection or keep sending, and whether you are surprised at what a particular magazine decides to take. I like to think I do my homework. I don’t submit if I’ve no idea what the editors are publishing. I was thrilled when RHINO took “The Silent Treatment,” and I submitted again the following year with poems I thought would fit, but was turned down. I have two poems in the new issue of RHINO 2010, “Steam” and “sPonge,” the latter being an homage to Francis Ponge. French again!I often let a poem sit. Just as often I go on a campaign, sending out multiple subs. I never submitted “Tinder Box” again after RHINO turned it down. When Apparatus started up about five years later, I went through some older poems to decide if I just wanted them to die, and gave “Tinder Box” a second chance. They took it, and even nominated it for a Pushcart, so you never know. Still, it’s most important the poet like the poem. You can hear it praised to heaven and if you don’t like it, it’s going to sit poorly in your gut.Because you are in Germany, do you seek out online magazines? Or print magazines that now have online submissions? And has your life as a poet gotten easier with online submission managers? (Any horror stories? Never hearing back, etc. You don’t have to name names.)When I started submitting I went with online because it was easier. It’s still easier, but I submit to print sometimes, too, although it really is a postal hassle. I’m lucky now that many do take online submissions because it costs me six euros in postage to submit by snail mail if every poem is on a separate page, which it is. If I have to withdraw a poem, I have to send another letter. And then, yes, after all that time, trouble and money, you get journals that never answer. I’d like to think something went wrong with the post but mostly I suspect they couldn’t be bothered despite all the postage I slapped on the SASE.I appreciate the editors’ conundrum, though – it’s way easier for everyone to use online submissions, but suddenly the journal has poems out the wazoo. I’m sure it blisters.I love “Opportunity,” the opening poem. How did you come to write that one?Someone was telling me about a call they missed because their cell phone was turned off. It’s just a poem about missing the cue, or being too wound up in something that seems more important, like making yourself marvelous.Is “Folk Art” about a relationship as well as art?Yes. I love naïve and folk art and the imperfections they breed. I made quilts myself for a while, very badly. I always find it sad and funny to see a painting of someone whose head is way too big or whose arms are too short. I get a great comic rush of empathy. There’s something truthful about it. In the poem, that typical image is the jumping-off point for a failed relationship, the speaker having been painted by a handicapped mechanic, her lost lover more a product of John Singer Sargent.Many hot poems here—lots of heat and humidity. Were several indeed written in a hot and humid spell?I’ve never liked hot weather. It stems from my teenage reluctance to be seen in shorts. I just enjoy being fully clothed! “Summer’s End” was inspired by heat, or rather the ebb of heat, and the comfort that brings. We had a very hot summer in 2004 and again in 2006 and you know the Europeans don’t do air conditioning, which I’m kind of glad about.“Humidity” is more about misunderstanding and incomprehension, but found a good metaphor in the weather. “Humidity” was one poem I wasn’t sure would fly, but I was lucky it was taken by the first journal I sent it to. Other poems in the book – “Folk Art” for example – almost died in the no-go file. I submitted “Folk Art” about 12 places before a print journal took it, then Verse Daily ran it, which made me really happy.I love the ugly sunglasses in “Shady” and the “idiot mittens” of cell phones. We are in contemporary time, then suddenly there’s Jesus, shoeless, by way of comparison. I love the helplessness in the center of the poem, the stripping away. How did you get this poem?\"Shady” is a happy accident poem. I’d lost my sunglasses and my mother gave me hers, which were incredibly awful, but did the trick, sunwise. On one of the days I resorted to wearing them, my sandal fell apart while I was going the short distance to the sandwich shop across from my office. A distance in which I was completely destroyed – my ego, my attire. There I stood persecuted by life, humble and victimized. It was hard to believe, as shady as the story of Jesus.“Idiot mittens” is a steal from Bill Cosby, who talks about them in a skit on his 1960s record “Why is There Air?,” referring to those mittens kids wear that are connected by a string. He joked about pulling on one hand and the kid smacking himself in the face with the other hand. Which brings me to the cell phone.Then, from barefoot to “High Heeled” on the next page. Is this a persona poem, or are you a constant striver? Comfortable with/troubled by your own amibitons?That’s definitely a persona poem, and more about vulnerability than ambition. Weirdly enough, it started out as a Sept. 11 twin towers poem. I know all that is erased. Still, it goes to show, start writing and you never know what you’ll end up with.I ask because the voice, and problem, sounds so different in “The Problem with Everything,” where there is a kind of wide, ongoing, indiscriminate empathy with things & people.I’m a great believer in things, like the child who believes her doll is real, or the grown man who talks to his gun. The speaker in the poem doesn’t want to care but she can’t help caring. Even the gum stuck to her shoe is symbolic of something horribly sad, and everything that goes wrong goes wrong with her specifically in mind.Tell me anything you want me to know about the book. And ignore any question that troubles you, or rewrite it to answer as you wish. I am asking the naïve questions, because I am like that.I found it a bit difficult to choose poems for the chapbook. I didn’t have a bunch of poems that seemed to naturally belong together. So I chose by feeling rather than topic or theme or form or anything. With all but one of the poems in the first person, I think it ended up well, but it’s still not that cohesive mass of glue that some chap publishers seem to favor.I do have a number of poems now that use household items as a springboard (toaster, kettle, faucet, etc), which I hope someday to publish. “Steam” and “sPonge” are among them.[Now I can’t wait for Sarah’s household item chapbook!! ]*”Tinder Box.” Did you have a house fire? I ask because we did.Yes, years ago when I was 23 or 24. But no one died, and the house wasn’t destroyed, just badly damaged. With the insurance money, I was able to pay off a chunk of my student loans, and I used the opportunity to switch from cassette tape and LP vinyl to CDs, which is where we were in technological history at the time. As much as a house fire can be a terrible thing, and it was for my parents (I was in grad school and living with them), for me it was a very freeing experience to lose everything but whatever I had in the trunk of my car."},

I hope he will tell us why! (I owe Dustin a letter, snail mail (!), but I hope he will forgive me for writing not to him but about him...for the moment.)The Innocents Abroad is sort of a travel book, one famous for a version of \"the ugly American\" and for spoofing just about everything, including religion, as the tourists are headed to the Holy Land.  So keep that in mind as you embark on summer travel.Mark Twain is famous for his humor, of course, and for his sadness later in life, for being the father of American literature as the author of The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (sometimes banned these days, for using the language of its time), and for coming in and going out with Halley's Comet.I am just now reading about Mark Twain's feud with Bret Harte!  They were friends early on, and I'm not sure yet what happened, but I will find out in the Literary Feuds book, by Anthony Arthur, which I did pick up off the floor in the bookstore above. So far I know that Harte was successful first, and that some think he veers toward the sentimental in pleasing readers with the good side of the West, keeping silent about the bad.  And that Samuel Clemens was very ambitious, and had to get the heck out of Nevada for insulting a lady...and having her husband come after him with a gun.  And, as in The Innocents Abroad, Clemens (Twain) was not very tolerant of anything sentimental.  So, we'll see....(Some people think I am sentimental, maybe because I cry at Hallmark commercials.  But I promise you that, while I can be jerked around, I will not jerk you around.)Now I am 1) very hungry for breakfast, but 2) off to swim, as I was advised to try the later time, to avoid the crowds.  Yes, there are crowded lap-swim lanes at 6:30 in the morning. More books, and more feuds, to come!"},

I just finished The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, by Stieg Larsson, and a character in it reads a lot of mysteries, including Dorothy Sayers. My kids are on a Friends kick, and Ross has just been going on and on about paleontology, and Joey somehow did not realize chickens were highly-edible-Kentucky-fried birds, and Unearthing the Dragon is about how dinosaurs are more like birds than lizards, and the research that supports this relatively new discovery.Childhood--I remember all those books about dinosaurs as the \"great lizards.\" And, yes, dragons. They were always reptiles in my mind. To think of them also as birds is really neat! I love revision, and revision of knowledge. That's all for now.

I heard it on NPR! Morning Edition. Twice! Once very early, on the way to the pool for lap swimming, and once not too much later on the way back from the hospital for a fasting blood test. (Yes, doughnuts and highlander grog coffee on the way home.) Our local radio station repeats Morning Edition twice...in the morning, or it wouldn't make much sense.Anyway, The Icarus Syndrome is about flying too close to the sun in terms of hubris, or getting too big for our britches...and their waxed-on feathers. In fact the subtitle is A History of American Hubris, which suggests we just keep doing it, that neither myth nor experience has taught us how to avoid it.Tina Brown, in her Morning Edition interview, was noting that \"learning the lessons of Vietnam\" is hard to do, as warnings not to get involved in recent wars were not heeded and proved unfounded...but then, as Beinert explains, America got in a \"cycle of hubris\" and did try to do too much, namely Iraq and Afghanistan at the same time. To use yet another cliche, America bit off more than it could chew.Which brings me to chocolate pie. My friend Kim has offered to bring some to our book group discussion of The Help, by Kathryn Stockett. If you have read it, you know why I am thinking, \"Ick-R-Us.\""},
{"title": "Ayn Very Randy", "date": "Tuesday, June 15, 2010", "text": "Day 127 of the \"What are you reading, and why?\" project and Fred is reading The Fountainhead by Ayn Rand because his daughter made him. He is reacting as some of the first reviewers did, finding it very long--heh heh, \"a whale of a book,\" to tie in with all those baleens in earlier entries--with not very pleasant characters.It is, however, a very popular book, especially among young people seeking a heroic philosophy of life and/or older people seeking to justify a life of rational self-interest. I remember when my uncle insisted that I read The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged, which I did find intriguing in my 20s, and which I did see entwining with the philosophies of Aristotle and Nietzsche, having just read them in college. However, my uncle was also a follower of L. Ron Hubbard, the science fiction writer who created a religion.I asked Fred if The Fountainhead was the one with the excellent roll-your-own cigarettes, but it isn't. That's Atlas Shrugged, where the really smart people, the best people, who know how to make good things, retreat to a mountain and make the rest of the country's economy fall apart since they are no longer contributing to it. Oops! I think this plot spoiler is OK, as Rand's Objectivist philosophy is well known, and laid out nicely in Wikipedia. (I love Wikipedia, even though college students are not allowed to use it as source. It's a great place to go and have things all together, listed and summarized, and then you can go to the other sources to track things down and verify them.) Anyway, although smoking is bad for us, and we shouldn't do it, I remember intensely how good those roll-your-owns sounded in...Atlas Shrugged. (Plus, the title itself is a spoiler!)  She's smoking one in her portrait above.I had forgotten, till Wikipedia reminded me, that Rand was a Hollywood screenwriter, and even an actress--an extra, anyway.  But she did not like the film adaptations of her novels.  Sounds like she was a hard person to please, and had a falling out with her libertarian friend Isabel Paterson, of The God of the Machine.  Which reminds me of that book about literary feuds that I saw lying on the floor at Babbitt's.  I wonder if these two are in it!  (I'll let you know.  I am getting paid in books for labor & display of two poetry/art collages I made as samples for an upcoming workshop at the store in July, so maybe I will pay myself with the feud book.  I have already paid myself with The Life and Mind of Emily Dickinson, by Genevieve Taggard, which I have already read but didn't previously own a copy of; I read it back in college, as research for The Belle of Amherst.  And I would have paid myself with Sylvia Beach's book on her Shakespeare and Co. bookshop, which I held for myself for a couple days, but which I then released and of course somebody bought it.)I would just like to say, parenthetically, but outside the parentheses, that I forgive everybody for their love lives, Rand included.  Speaking of feuds, she was not very forgiving, even if she was randy enough to marry a fine-looking actor and later have a romance with Nathaniel Branden, also married, with the OK of the respective spouses (if we are to believe Wikipedia), because later, when Branden fell in love with somebody else, he and his wife (again trusting to Wikipedia) thought it best not to inform Rand, which turned out to be right, as when she found out she blasted him in print for his personal life.  Sigh...In the words of my friend Tom, who was defending a guy a bunch of other people were ridiculing, \"He's just a guy trying to get by,\" which might also be said of Rand, ridiculed as much as she is revered.  Alas, my kids know of her in glancing references in The Simpsons and South Park.  (Yes, I let my kids watch these things.  They are 20 and 15.  The 15-year-old doesn't watch South Park.)And now a whimsical discussion of the pronunciation of her first name.  In my 20s, when I was reading her books, I always heard it in my head as AYn, long \"a\" sound, as in Ayn Misbehavin'.  Later, one of my college students insisted it was just a quirky spelling of Ann.  And Wikipedia tells me it should be pronounced EYEn, long \"I\" sound, putting the \"I\" of her \"rational egoism\" and the \"eye\" of her visionary status right there in the sound of her name. Wikipedia also says this about another of her books:  \"Her novella Anthem was published in England in 1938 and in America seven years later. It presents a vision of a dystopian future world in which collectivism has triumphed to such an extent that even the word \"I\" has vanished from the language and from humanity's memory.\"And now, late for work, I must vanish."},

Meyer, presumably because she enjoyed this author's book A World Undone: The Story of the Great War, mentioned at Facebook in connection with this one.So many people have been fascinated by the Tudors, and so many books and films have told us the Tudor stories. Meyer suggests that legend has entwined with reality in the various accounts of Henry VIII and his wives and the reign of Elizabeth I, so he wanted to present a truer picture:\"The true shape of the Tudor story has been long obscured, even for leading historians, by religious controversy and differences of political ideology. It is only in the past couple of generations, as ancient passions have cooled, that the story has come into clear focus, and too often it has done so only for the historians themselves. For the public at large, the truth has continued to be overwhelmed by old legends with too little basis in fact. My hope for The Tudors, as it goes to press, is that it will help to bring popular understanding of one of history’s most deservedly famous dynasties into closer alignment with reality.\"Hence the subtitle The Complete Story of England's Most Notorious Dynasty.And I am blogging this morning thanks to the thunderstorms rumbling all around me. I drove to the pool as usual early this morning, but now it's not just lightning seen but thunder heard that delays, in 15 minute increments, our ability to get into the pool for early bird lap swimming. So this early bird caught no swim.And the daisies, just opened, have taken quite a pummeling lately, as have the fragile golden columbine. But it's great not to have to water everything, and to see how everything is thriving and green!

It wasn't that much of a delay, the usual pause to let freight trains go by, and traffic had been terrible, so Lizabeth was relieved to stop at a Barnes & Noble, pick up a paperback of a book she'd always wanted to read, continue on to Clinton Street near the station, and sit with the window open, a cool breeze having followed the drenching rain at 11:00 a.m., clearing off the awful heat and humidity of the day before.Then we headed off to Printers Row Lit Fest (previously known as Book Fair) on a beautiful, cool, breezy afternoon.  Of course the 11:00 rain could not have been fun for the all the booksellers, but it was gorgeous later in the day. We arrived to hear a sweet folksy voice singing \"Puff, the Magic Dragon.\"  It was indeed Peter Yarrow, of Peter, Paul, and Mary, there to sing and to sign copies of his children's book.  It was so moving to hear him sing, ad lib lyrics/verses, and speak of the memorial service for Mary Travers.  He will be at Ravinia this summer, on July 20, singing with Paul (Noel Paul Stookey).I picked up my contributor's copy of After Hours, their 10th anniversary issue, a double issue, and the new RHINO, to sell at Babbitt's.  Actually I will buy a copy, because it has Sarah J. Sloat in it!  And Lynn Pattison!  And Steven Schroeder.  Oh, and so many other fine poets!OK, but I am here to tell you what Lizabeth will be reading on the road, after The Moonstone.  She has a stack of paperback books and an excellent plan.  She has to do some extensive traveling for work, and will leave the book behind once she has read it, to make room in her luggage for souvenirs!

The church. Of Horines!This is a plastic ring binding of photocopied typescript, published for an interested audience. We have lots of this kind of thing--family history, church history, church ladies cookbooks, memoirs, etc. at Babbitt's and it was wonderful to hear from Karen what is in one of these, and a bit of what is left out. There is a lot about Miss Mabel, a bit of a rival perhaps to Mrs. Norma? Great anecdotes. Brief accounts of all the preachers over the years, church dinners and picnics (Dinner on the Ground), descriptions of the stained windows, and how each came about.  Sadness, the loss of a child. Even murder in the small town.The Horines of Missouri are one branch of the family, pronounced horEYN, and another branch lives in this area, pronounced horEEN, the piano people. The church in the area dates back to 1829, in the itinerant preacher days....which reminds me of that Eudora Welty story, where the preacher meets the bandit and they both meet Audubon.  This church history also reminds me of Gilead, by Marilynne Robinson, which I've read, and Home, which awaits me.The baleen whale has nothing to do with Horines.

Others included Ruth Plumly Thompson and Jack Snow, with various illustrators other than Denslow and Neill, including Jack Kramer and Dirk.Coincidentally, I also handled books by Gregory Maguire in the Wicked Years series, that re-see Oz from the witches' perspective.And, by further coincidence, I pondered all this in the context of the upcoming cemetery walk in our town--upcoming in October, but auditions are in June--that takes place in the cemetery where Dorothy is buried, the real Dorothy, who died young.And I got to experience my own joyful good fortune by way of the arrival, on roller skates, of my children on the sidewalk outside...come to borrow the car and receive some baklava.

{"title": "Save the Scrimshanders", "date": "Wednesday, June 9, 2010", "text": "Day 121 of the \"What are you reading, and why?\" project, and this is one of those entries following up on previous entries, including random coincidii (made up plural of coincidence, which has its own perfectly good plural) and other whimsy.Like Emily Dickinson, I love words. And, like myself, I love coincidii. Yesterday I told you about Late Wife, a book of poems by Claudia Emerson. Early in the book, in the \"Divorce Epistles\" section, is a stunning poem called \"Photograph: Farm Auction\" that focuses on a hayfork that resembles \"a plate of baleen / from the mouth of a whale.\" So today it is the word \"baleen\" that I love, a synonym for \"whalebone\" in one of its dictionary meanings, but specifically the plates in the mouth of the \"right whale,\" the kind of whale it was \"right\" for whalers to catch because of its abundance (and therefore profit potential), baleen being the whalebone of whalebone stays in women's corsets (for which there is a less of a market these days. Save the whales!) They are also called baleen whales, or just whalebone whales.Also yesterday, in the bookstore, I handled a book called The Yankee Scrimshanders, by Fredericka Alexander Burrows, about the art of scrimshaw, or carving on whalebone, with images of the carvings on whalebone stays for women's corsets! (Save the scrimshanders!)The coincidii just continue. We got another copy of The Technology of Orgasm, by Rachel P. Maines, a paperback for $5, shelved in Women's Studies, and it sold immediately, as I knew it would, so I didn't even try to talk about it here, or provide a link to our search page.I had bought the hardcover a while back...then couldn't find it in my house and wondered if I'd hidden it or loaned it out, but it is just that the lettering on the spine is squeezed in such a way as to make it not immediately readable, sort of like camouflage, I think. Anyhoo! I found my home copy. This ties in because the technology of orgasm, those machines doctors could use to relieve the \"hysteria\" of women, so they didn't have to do it, er, manually, or keep hiring midwives and other female assistants to do it for them, was big in the age of women's corsets!  As explored in Sarah Ruhl's new play on Broadway, In the Next Room, or The Vibrator Play.  (Save the orgasm!)Speaking of hayforks, my little Poetry at Babbitt's workshop will be reading poems about farming implements and the Farmer's Market and statues of Abraham Lincoln, at \"Fresh From the Farm,\" an event Saturday morning, June 26, 10:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m., during the Bloomington Farmers Market on the square, in the McLean County Museum of History.

Sigh...but I will.This won the Pulitzer Prize, and those Pulitzer prizewinners are good! The Wild Iris, a favorite of mine by Louise Gluck, also won the Pulitzer Prize.I am about to start the last section, the actual \"Late Wife\" section, which 1) is subtitled \"Letters to Kent,\" so it is epistolary, as was the first section, addressed to an ex-husband and 2) begins, I see, with sonnets. Googling, I found plenty of info on Emerson, and blurbs that tell me Kent is the new husband--first section was \"Divorce Epistles,\" second was \"Breaking Up the House\"--and that Kent is the one with a \"late wife,\" as in dead wife, though the first two sections of the book make the speaker into a \"late wife\" of her first marriage, too, dead and resurrected, in a way.You can read \"Artifact,\" the first sonnet in the \"Late Wife\" section, or book the author to speak, here at Blue Flower Arts. This is one of those lovely random things for me, as I am working on a poem with a quilt in it, too!You can also read \"Biology Lesson,\" about the link between the turtle and the bird, a poem from her next book, Figure Studies, which will now call to me as I love science as well as poetry, and here I get two, two, two mints in one! But I am a bit astonished at the number of typos in the poem on the Blue Flower Arts website--hope they fix that! Of course, I see how it can happen, as my pinky often does the same....Here, at her own website, are Emerson's other books. Look at the gorgeous cover on Pinion. Oh, there is so much poetry I want to read. I have friends' books yet to order, and now these. How will I ever keep up?  Many thanks for these borrowed books!Holy cow!  Her new husband is a musician, and she also writes songs with him and performs!  Yay!  Folk, bluegrass, jazz, blues, and more.

I will have to get a new summer routine now that I swim in the morning when I used to be blogging. Maybe I will write the blog entries in my head, while swimming, and then come home and write them down.

Are these more books that followed her home?Strength in What Remains, by Tracy Kidder, is the amazing story of Deogratius of Burundi and his persistent hope in the face of terrible experiences and haunting memories.The Little Stranger, a novel, by Sarah Waters, might seem to be lighter reading after Deo's story, but it is haunting, too, a ghost story, set in England in the aftermath of World War II.But at least there should be some relief from humorist Bill Bryson as he recounts of the horrors of sharks, gigantic earthworms, and being baked alive in Australia in In a Sunburned Country.And Kim is supposed to be reading The Help, by Kathryn Stockett, for a book group. She can read my copy, if she takes very, very good care of it, because I have finished it. Really good story. Revisited my childhood in a way, since I even spent 5 years of it in the South, with a woman helping with children and housework in our home, a woman I loved. She had come highly recommended by the county welfare agency, where my mom worked.But wait a minute, Ladder of Years is about a middle-aged woman who runs away from home, husband, and kids. I've felt like that at times. I've actually 1) walked out the door and around the block when really miffed or 2) driven down the road and had a glass of wine with my mom, instead of moving to from Baltimore to Delaware, as Delia does in this novel, which now seems like something I had better read.

Here's her website.Richard is reading Vibrant Matter: A Political Ecology of Things, by Jane Bennett and his written about it in his own blog, where he mentions a \"blog-chain reading group.\" Wow, what a great idea! The Bennett book looks really important, presenting a philosophy of \"vital materialism.\" (I don't want to apply my weird punnish humor, but I do want to say \"vital.\") Looks like Bennett, like Sandra Steingraber, handles all the complexities in environmental issues, their science, their politics.

I assume she's reading it because 1) she lives in Chicago and 2) she's read others in the series, as this is #3.In Harvey's mysteries, Michael Kelly, a former police officer turned private investigator solves crimes in Chicago, with a great feel for the city because the author, a former journalist, still lives and owns a bar there.  I wonder if all my Chicago police officer friends are reading this series?!This one is pursuing murders on the CTA, so maybe I should avoid it, as I take a lot of public transportation in Chicago.  There is a particularly chilling murder on an el platform, here excerpted via the Washington Post review by Gerald Bartell:Kelly has his own nasty brush with the sniper...one snowy morning when a man named Robles approaches a woman standing on a mass-transit train platform. He points a gun at her left temple and fires. She drops \"like a puppet with the strings cut all here and there, arms, legs, and a smear of lipstick across her lips and down her chin.\" Ew, ew, ew.  Both the Chicago Tribune and the Chicago Sun Times think I should be reading it, though.  Plus, there's the Archdiocese connection, and I used to live in St. Gertrude's parish.  Hmm, might have to take up the reading of mysteries, after all.But my Barbara Pym awaits, and it's her birthday.  I like her because she's subtle and funny and acutely observant, a sort of 1950s Jane Austen.  But nobody read her for 20 years because she went out of fashion!  Pooey on them.  Then her friend and pen pal, poet Philip Larkin, brought her back into style by nominating her as \"the most underrated writer of the century.\"  Someday I hope to be the most underrated writer of the century, too.  (Oh.  Wait.)Thank you, Writer's Almanac, which also reminds me that it's also Thomas Hardy's birthday.  Happy birthday, dead writers.  Thanks for being born."},

Amazingly, in this book, the humor and cheerfulness abound in a novel really about grief.  The main character is a widow at 36.And I have no trouble believing in the rebounding joy here, as I met, this spring, a woman who had also lost her husband, young, to cancer, and was juggling grief, joy, and children like a pro in the circus of life.  People are so amazing, so resilient, so beautiful.  Oh, people, I wish you, too, boundless joy and some way through your inevitable griefs.Recently I borrowed and read Donald Hall's book of poems, The Painted Bed, because a poet friend wanted me to read it.  She warned me that it would be dark and raw, and it was.  These are poems of grief at the loss of his wife, the poet Jane Kenyon, also to cancer.  Though written over a period of years, the poems are fresh in sorrow and rage.  In fact, I could not make it through all of them, but it was time to return the book, so I did.  If I need more woe, I can turn to Kenyon's own Collected Poems, here in my office, sitting atop Robert Burton's Anatomy of Melancholy.And now the sun is shining, and I will go gaze at the Ohio blue spiderwort blooming on the north side of the house."},
{"title": "Stumbling Blocks", "date": "Monday, May 31, 2010", "text": "Day 111 of the “What are you reading, and why?” project. Little did I know, when I left for church yesterday, that I was headed for an amazing reflection (we don’t have sermons) by historian Mark Wyman, entitled “How Should We Remember Horrible Events?” which, indeed, reminded us that the Holocaust was very, very real.It was the perfect thing for the Sunday before Memorial Day, when we remember our fallen soldiers, and thus also the horrors of war, and our ongoing human conflicts.Mark spoke movingly of how to remember any of our troubling actions of the past, how to honor victims, how to listen to the apologies and accept the restorative actions of descendants of perpetrators. He spoke of avoiding cliché memorials and gestures that lose their meaning. He asked us to consider new and meaningful memorials and gestures.Examples: Classes in Duluth, Minnesota that teach young people about a horrible lynching in the past, so those 3 innocent men, circus workers, who died June 15, 1920, are not forgotten, and neither is our human capacity for folly and for evil. An empty library in Berlin, to commemorate the books burned by the Nazis, underground, seen through a glass pane in the street.And the stumbling blocks, or stolpersteine, on streets in Germany, where artist Gunter Demnig has placed plaques on raised stones to remind us who lived where, who was taken, who died, and when, and what small privileges were taken away from Gypsies and Jews in the 1940s. No pets, no buying of pastries or cakes. It starts small, ends in Holocaust.As I understand it, the stolpersteine make us confront the stumbling blocks of the past, the things we’d rather forget, but can’t, shouldn’t. In a way, we stumble, so we do not fall, again.In the comments afterward, Becca spoke of a film, The White Ribbon, that has made her think about such things, and a book, a memoir by Christa Wolf called Patterns of Childhood, formerly A Model Childhood, mentioned here earlier because Susan was reading it. (We have Model Childhood at Babbitt’s, along with some of Wolf’s books in German.) There are all kinds of ways to remember.Mark is the author himself of several books on American history. The most recent is Hoboes: Bindlestiffs, Fruit Tramps, and the Harvesting of the West. And check out Wyman’s author page at Amazon for the rest!Mark’s wife, Eva Goldschmidt Wyman, is the editor of Los Poetas y la General (The Poets and the General): Chile’s Voices of Dissent Under August Pinochet, 1973-1989, a bilingual edition, poems in Spanish and facing page translations in English. She is also the author of Huyendo del Infierno Nazi: La Immigracion Judio-Alemana Hacia Chile en los Anos Treinte, in Spanish, about Germans who went to live in Chile during and after World War II. Her work is available at Babbitt’s, Dan Wyman Books in Brooklyn, and various places online, including Google books.Let us remember our fallen, those who died in military service for our country, today, Memorial Day. Let us remember the harm we can do when we are not doing good. Let us remember to do what good we can. Let us remember it is not always easy to know what to do.Thank you for remembering."},

Great ideas, great suggestions, great brain food for thought.Charles was about halfway through The Greatest Show on Earth, by Richard Dawkins, not a circus book, when I asked the \"What are you reading?\" question at Facebook a week or so ago, so he must be 3/4 of the way through or perhaps finished by now! Here's exactly what he said:I'm about halfway through Richard Dawkins's new book The Greatest Show on Earth, the best assessment I've seen of the evidence for evolution. Although evolution is accepted as scientific fact by all reputable scientists, a recent Gallup poll reveals that 44 percent of Americans believe that God created the earth and all living creatures within the last 10,000 years. With ignorance like that, who needs the Texas school board! Anyway, if you have any lingering doubts about evolution or if you're looking for ammunition to argue with those who do, pick up this marvelous new book. It'll fill you with wonder and awe.It does amaze me that there are people who don't believe in evolution at all, or who mix religion and science, but hey! Seems to me the evidence for evolution is all around for the looking, as well as in this and other books.I gather that Dawkins annoys several people by comparing creationists to Holocaust-deniers. I can't comment on that, not having read the book, except to say 1) the Holocaust was real and 2) evolution is real. We can debate and further quibble about how exactly evolution works, and whether Charles Darwin, an early describer and proponent, was correct in everything he thought, and no doubt he wasn't, as science has been wrong before, and then corrected itself, etc., etc., but surely evolution is going on out there in the natural world via genetics and mutations and adaptations.Dawkins also wrote The God Delusion, and even the title of that troubles a number of people.I guess I am someone who can live with ambiguity, uncertainty, and paradox. And I guess I must define God differently than the people who can't believe in evolution.Speaking of God, and perhaps delusions, and also \"ammunition,\" today is the day that, in 1431, Joan of Arc was burned at the stake. If not delusions, then visions. I have no trouble believing that Joan had visions, that she inspired an army, and that she shouldn't have been burned at the stake (Wikipedia says she was burned at the stake thanks to a biblical clothing law), but that, since she did, and since she was, she has had a huge and lasting effect on generations since, since she acted on her beliefs, and died for them. (That's a lot of \"since.\")Woops! Look at the time. More coffee, le toast, then off to church!"},

Karl rocks, too. We also have a fancy hardback copy of it at Babbitt's, but I think the link might just take you to the general search page (for some unknown reason), but you can just type in Dave Eggers.  (I think this link to the tote bag will work, though.)Because I don't rock and am not hip or cool, and was in that no-books-no-movies zone of raising young children when he first hit the publishing scene, I did not know very much about Dave Eggers, just the title of that first amazing book, A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius, a fictionalized account of raising his little brother after their parents died. There has been lots of trouble in the Eggers family. Dealing with it via genius and humor is the way to go.Then I saw McSweeney's Quarterly at Babbitt's and went, \"Whoa!\" Each one is different. Some look like a conventional paperback quarterly journal, some like hardback books, one like a newspaper, one like something that would come in your mailbox, one like a cigar box, etc. We got some in at Babbitt's (some still shrinkwrapped), and I see some are on sale at The McSweeney's Store.I think it's wonderful that McSweeney's began as a journal that would publish only stuff rejected by other journals! Now it is sought out by writers who love it, major pagers (made-up term), and writers with that peculiar ingenuity in mind. It really makes me wish I were hip or cool.I could, of course, become more hip by reading the Believer, the McSweeney's magazine (samples online), separate from McSweeney's Quarterly Concern, and from Believer Books (which does books, book club, used books via garage sale, etc., and McSweeney's also publishes its own Books, separate from the Quarterly and the Believer Book offerings), and maybe I will. But it might be too discouraging, as in litost, that sudden realization of one's own miserable existence, since Nick Hornby (famous, funny) writes a column called \"Stuff I've Been Reading\" that of course is hipper and cooler than mine.I realize we have a stack of Believers on a shelf at Babbitt's. I am going to have to look at those when I get back to work, and maybe become a weensy bit hipper. Sunday afternoon. We are closed Monday, for Memorial Day. I will be picnicking and asking my parents what they are reading. We are taking dessert--blueberries, strawberries, Cool Whip & angel food cake torn up together in a red, white, and blue trifle like thing I will make up as I go along. I am so not hip.I have hips.Happy Birthday, Karl. Have a wonderful life, Dave. It's time for breakfast, coffee and le toast."},

Laura has just finished reading Dark Life, a young adult science fiction \"western\" by Kat Falls, and is moving on to some Ursula Leguin Earthsea sequels, because science fiction rocks! (I think that's why. Laura, you can tell us more about why.) Is that a jellyfish, or are you just happy to see me?Young adulthood is when I fell in love with science fiction, and I haven't read very much since, though Leguin has been recommended to me frequently. But I did read and love The Sparrow and Children of God, by Maria Doria Russell, after frequent recommendations, and those recommenders were definitely right. The Russell novels are a wonderful combination of science fiction, cultural anthropology, and comparative religion. I learned a heck of a lot about Earth before we went off it.I loved talking to Curt (of a past entry), who had read a lot of classic science fiction with his mother growing up, because she was in a science fiction book club. I could talk to Curt about Zenna Henderson and The People books! I have Henderson paperbacks on a bookshelf upstairs and may bring them to the beach this summer to entice the kids. (Me, I'm bringing Barbara Pym. And Three Men in a Boat.)Laura is also reading The Book Thief, by Markus Zusak, which is marketed as young adult fiction in the U.S. but was written as general adult fiction in Australia. I think an Australian first told me about it. Narrated by Death, it takes place during World War II and has a child heroine. Dark as that sounds, it looks to be a charming, moving, and even uplifting book, maybe the way The Diary of Anne Frank is uplifting and heartbreaking at once.Or, since Death is called wry and sardonic by readers and reviewers of The Book Thief, maybe it is more like Dead Like Me, a television series my son found on Hulu, with the amazing Mandy Patinkin in it. Markus Zusak is pretty darn cute, too."},

Many of them also wrote poetry and literature.” A lovable bunch of \"lunaticks,\" these fellows were, as the subtitle says, Five Friends Whose Curiosity Changed the World. Indeed, one was James Watt of the famous steam engine, and one was Joseph Priestley, who figured out what oxygen was! One was Josiah Wedgwood, of Wedgwood china, and one was Erasmus Darwin, who gave us...Charles Darwin, his grandson, and evolutionary awareness. And one was a toymaker, Matthew Boulton. What a powerful bunch of inventive brains!Wow! And tonight is the full moon, giving plenty of light to travel home by (if it doesn’t storm) or poetic inspiration. I am very touched that many people have been writing, calling, and emailing to say they are reading my new poetry chapbook, Living on the Earth, just out from Finishing Line Press and also available at Babbitt’s Books, which has a little almost full moon on the cover. (See, I told you I would tell you more here in the blog when it came out. Sigh, once again, all about me! But, never fear, I’ll be linking you to plenty of Un-Me.)The working title for this book was Living on the Moon, and was building itself around what would have been the title poem, first published in Fifth Wednesday. (Thanks to editor Vern Miller for that, and guest poetry editor Nina Corwin of the inaugural issue!) Here is the poem, partly inspired by a news story on National Public Radio and partly by a feeling of alienation, as business and politics “as usual” carried on in our country and my personal life was squeezing the air out of me.Living on the MoonWhen they finally come, they’ll find mehere already. I won’t have disturbedthe flag on its pole,only a photograph, anyway,only a memory now.I’ve received the radio transmissionon Neil Armstrong’s sound glitch, his intended grammar.They will all want to say the right thingbut there’s not enough oxygen.I’ve watched the ice caps melt. I know whythey are coming.They’ll discover on their own how cliché devolvesinto truth: you really can’t go home again.But I can show them how to live here step by step,small by giant.I’ve learned how to breathewith my helmet off.I’ve learned how to climb out of all the craters.Then we had another election, people started to go “green,” the local food movement took off, I quit my job and left everything but my husband, and I began to feel more like Living on the Earth. But that’s another title poem, for another day. (Thank you, dears, for reading my book!)Meanwhile, the cold Martian winter has, as scientists expected, caused the Phoenix to bite the mythically red Martian dust.

Toll. Todd was in the U.S. Navy. What a good book to be reading and pondering as we come up on Memorial Day, the holiday created to honor those who died in military service.We had only an ad hoc navy during the American Revolution, and it took time and debate to create an official navy in the 1790s, but it was firmly in place for the War of 1812. Looks like this book lays out the issues and isn't just about the battles, and reviewers praise the first book of Toll, a financial analyst before he was a writer. I love the names of the six frigates that formed our early Navy: Constitution, Constellation, Congress, President, United States, and Chesapeake.One of the Navy websites (linked above) is America's Navy: a Global Force for Good, which brings up something Quentin has encountered. He is reading No Simple Victory, by Norman Davies, about World War II. I'll let Quentin give you his summary:I've 10 pages left in No Simple Victory, Norman Davies' effort to capture the whole of WW II in Europe Short version: This was essentially a conflict between two horrific totalitarian states. We ended up aiding one of them, which ensured defeat of the Nazis and incidentally established us as a premier economic power. America's sacrifices and strategic efforts were modest, relative to what others did and went through. In hindsight, particularly with the public awareness of the death camps and the repression of information about the gulag, we found a WW II narrative of \"a battle against evil\" that we still believe. Every other country has a strange and particular narrative of the conflict. Not a ton of laffs, but a very healthy corrective to Stephen Ambrose, etc. And tonight my book group will be discussing Hotel at the Corner of Bitter and Sweet, by Jamie Ford, reminding us that nothing was simple on the homefront, either, even in the United States, distant from so much of that war, but dramatically involved by way of Pearl Harbor. This novel handles gently the rude fact of our concentration camps for Japanese-Americans during WW II. Here is another debate, of course, but the novel shows amazing patience and loyalty in the face of that terrible dislocation of American citizens."},

Mary is an amazing reader, and of course now I want to read her stack. At the moment, I mostly want to read See What I’m Saying because it sounds so fascinating! (And it ties right in with something Quentin is reading, which I’ll tell you about tomorrow.)See What I’m Saying is about the amazing information our senses give us, and how our other senses compensate when we lose one, etc. If I read this book, I can learn to echolocate like a bat! It reminds me of synesthesia, both a medical condition and a literary technique of blending the senses. Some people literally do see what someone is saying, or see colors associated with certain words, or smell things. Because it happens in real life, it can happen in a poem, too, to liven things up or make us “see” in new ways!And, too tempting, I think we actually have a copy of Distant Land at Babbitt’s, because it is fiction. It is very, very hard to hold on to his nonfiction, which walks out the door as soon as it comes in, if it comes in at all.

(I asked again at Facebook, and got tons of answers, so you will be hearing about that for a while!) The authorship of Shakespeare's plays continues to be contested, and this should be a particularly interesting account, as it's written by the same guy who wrote A Year in the Life of William Shakespeare, 1599, \"an intimate history of Shakespeare,\" according to the front flap. In this book, Shakespeare wrote his own plays. So, in Contested Will, what is explored will be the controversies themselves, and why anyone would suppose otherwise. Looks fascinating, as some of the doubters were Sigmund Freud, Mark Twain, and Helen Keller!Robert reported that he was going to see (not read) Burn Your Bookes, a play (meant to be seen & heard, not read) by Richard Byrne, about Edward Kelley, an alchemist, and John Dee, a dabbler, both famous in Czechoslovakian culture. They went to Bohemia (where Perdita is sent in Shakespeare's play A Winter's Tale, as I recall, though that might have been a dream...) and looked into crystal balls, as alchemy and the occult seem inextricably linked.(I know this rather too well, having handled a lot of occult books recently at Babbitt's. I started to feel queasy and dusty, so there might be something to it.)I learned from the Washington Post article (linked above) that, according to playwright Byrne, \"that whole alchemical tradition of Prague was one of those things Czech scholars could go to England and talk about and not worry about being too political.\" And here is where I want to hear from Doug (of Doug's List, not Julie, sorry, mistyped in previous-but-alas-published draft), who said that Tom Stoppard plays are usually not political. I always thought that was because he came from a repressive culture, affected by Communism, and had to write in \"code,\" so to speak, as if about other things, in order to comment on society at all.

If you are trying to make an important decision:1) ask yourself to think about it right before falling asleep, and/or2) write a poem about itSo, anyway, Gayla was reading this ex-library book I was handling at the bookstore, getting ready to describe into the database.

An olive green copy sprinkled with little offwhite flowers passed through my hands yesterday at Babbitt's, and I was intrigued. Though it is called a novel, Anderson's short preface identified it as a hybrid form of poetry and prose, sort of an essay/essai (as in \"try something\"), and his concern in the book is \"the machine,\" or man and the machine, and how, perhaps, women might be men's salvation at this turning point in American life.I will not comment on how women as men's salvation sometimes just means picking up after them. Sigh... But I do notice (in his Wikipedia bio) that Anderson also has a book called Many Marriages and had them (4), so perhaps women were not his personal salvation. I also notice that Ernest Hemingway seems to have skewered him in at least two novels, but what goes around comes around and poor Ernie Kabob has been skewered, too. Hence, The Old Man and the Sea, or so they say. Marlin Kabob.Speaking of unfortunate skewerings, Anderson is the author who died on a cruise after swallowing the toothpick in his martini. No wonder F. Scott Fitzgerald loved him.Anderson has been mentioned previously, and recently, in this blog--in Doug's List and follow-up comments, and in the context of a past Great Books Chicago event, but that was his best-known work, Winesburg, Ohio, a set of interconnected short stories.A first edition of Olive Kitteridge, also a set of interconnected short stories, also passed through my hands this week, long enough for me to note that the stories were written and separately published over quite a long span of time, a comfort to me, as I've had to set aside the writing of short fiction during the hardworking/childrearing years, and a bit of time for it is just now coming back.And this week in vintage sales, a young man headed east bought a copy of The Great Gatsby, which returns to the values of the Midwest; a land surveyor came in search of another hardcover Catcher in the Rye, a book he collects and reads frequently, sharing my love of perennials; and a third random stranger bought a just arrived $2 paperback of Franny and Zooey.

Cover art is a painting by my husband! (Let me know, and we'll figure out how to send you one!)  Image for today is the poster from a past event, the poetry reading at the arts center, during Illinois Arts Week.Mainly I will celebrate with some bookish news culled from the Internet and National Public Radio.For example, NPR told me this morning that this day in 1609 brought the first publication of Shakespeare's sonnets! Yay! Oh, that reminds me that I have another thing to celebrate: a nice review of my chapbook Broken Sonnets in Fiddler Crab Review, an online magazine that celebrates the chapbook, or the very slim volume of verse.NPR also shared the news that George Washington never returned the book Law of Nations to the library, but, lest he be thought a deadbeat, a society has donated a new copy of the book to the library, which has waived the $300,000 fine.And, as I told you in an earlier entry, the Lost Man Booker Prize was indeed awarded yesterday. And the winner is....Troubles, by J G Farrell. Here's some info about the book from the Man Booker website:Troubles is the first in Farrell's Empire Trilogy, which was followed by The Siege of Krishnapur (1973) and The Singapore Grip (1978). The Siege of Krishnapur won the Booker Prize in 1973 and was shortlisted for the Best of the Booker, a special award created to mark the 40th anniversary of the prize in 2008. Farrell died in 1979.So Farrell was a big Booker winner, it appears. I could not find The Bay of Noon, by Shirley Hazzard, also nominated, at work, but I will keep an eye out for it.Ah! And we will be celebrating at work, too! Not the 100th day of my book-blog project, but a little gathering of current and former co-workers. We were going to go to lunch together, but the boss is headed to Chicago, so, while the cat's away, the mice will play. That is, we will clean off the counter and have a picnic while we mind the store!I doubt there will be cake, but there might be cookies. And hummus. And my famous pasta salad, with tuna and green olives!Ah, and my other cause for celebration is that my new poetry chapbook, Living on the Earth (Finishing Line Press, New Women's Voices Series No. 74), is indeed out there in the world, and people are receiving their single pre-ordered copies. I have not yet received my big box of author copies, but you can be sure I'll let you know when I do, in another \"all about me\" kind of blog entry. Because, you know, it's always all about me."},
{"title": "Blue Carbuncle", "date": "Wednesday, May 19, 2010", "text": "Day 99 of the \"What are you reading, and why?\" project. Sarah, newly graduated from college, is reading \"The Adventure of the Blue Carbuncle\" and other Sherlock Holmes stories, by Arthur Conan Doyle, after getting hooked on them in a class.This is the story in which the rare garnet turns up in a Christmas goose.Based on the black and white Sherlock Holmes movies she'd seen on TV, Sarah thought Doyle might be sort of a stuffy writer. She was delighted to find that the stories are lighthearted and accessible, which helps her understand the mass appeal in their own time and the liveliness of the most recent movie version. She didn't like the movie much, but she understands it better now, having read the original stories. And they are a fun read, right after college and starting a fulltime job, each one very satisfying but not taking too much of her time.We chatted about the word \"carbuncle\" which always calls up an icky hard callous dripping pus, far cry from a garnet but not so far, really, as the root word means \"coal\" and both the red (or deep purple or blue) gemstone and the bacterial wound are hard, compact.Carbuncles appear elsewhere in literature, mostly in their gemstone sense, but not always! Wikipedia conveniently tells us there are carbunckles in The Picture of Dorian Gray, by Oscar Wilde, \"The Great Carbuncle,\" by Nathaniel Hawthorne, and the Bible.Art by Herbert Zohl! I think he is making this available as a print you can buy."},
{"title": "Everything Must Change", "date": "Tuesday, May 18, 2010", "text": "Day 98 of the \"What are you reading, and why?\" project, and some small groups in my town are reading Everything Must Change by Brian D. McLaren, because they are socially-minded progressive Christians who plan to discuss it. And probably, then, do something, as I gather the oomph of the book is to put beliefs in practice, and help effect change.It's the title, and the idea of change, that moves me today.Everything must change--I know that, I watch it, I live it daily--but I am also in tune with cycles of change, so I see how things persist and return. I plant perennials, so they'll come back. They come back differently, responding to the weather that year, what's sprung up near them. I let the cinquefoil, a volunteer wildflower, stand between the bleeding heart and the pinks, because it wants to be there, and it will be there next year, too.My boss and I enjoy certain Pandora stations at work that play old standards. I love to hear the familiar melodies in all these variations--voices themselves familiar from other songs, new in this one, this one made new.I love reading new books, and I love re-reading old books, new again in the light of experience. I love reading books about familiar places, re-seen. I love reading books that connect to other books, bringing things together.When I studied political philosophy in college, a persistent frustration was that, to change anything, really, and deeply, one would have to 1) change human nature (if one had been able even to define it...) and/or 2) raze everything and start anew. But if the human nature thing had been imperfectly handled or understood, starting anew was doomed. And razing everything was violent and devastating, the risk of all revolutions.And \"revolution\"--the word itself--contains its own undoing."},
{"title": "*Rampant Abuse of the Asterisk*", "date": "Monday, May 17, 2010", "text": "Day 97 of the “What are you reading, and why?” project. A regular Babbitt’s customer is now reading The Penguin Book of Irish Fiction, edited by Colm Toibin, and was thrilled to discover it on our shelves. Where it no longer resides.Published in 2000, this anthology covers a great span of time, and range of writers, including Jonathan Swift, James Joyce, Maeve Binchy (may I just say that my cousin’s baby is named Maeve?!), Roddy Doyle, William Trevor (ah!), Emma Donahue, and Colum McCann. And another decade of Irish writing has gone on since.Our happy customer had read The Master and The Heather Blazing by Toibin and various works by several of the authors represented in the anthology and was eager to discover more authors and more samples* of those she likes.Toibin’s newest novel is Brooklyn, which won Britain’s Costa** (previously Whitbread) Book Award in Fiction and was on the Man Booker Prize*** long list in 2009, along with William Trevor’s Love and Summer. (Sheldon is reading the 2009 winner, Wolf Hall, by Hilary Mantel, and so was Mary, in a previous blog entry!)**Costa Coffee! (This should please Coffee Lovin’ Mom and a number of other addicts. And this, of course, makes perfect sense. If you drink enough coffee, you will not fall asleep reading.)From reading The Master myself, recommended by Lizabeth, and the reviews of some of his other works, I know that Toibin is a subtle writer, trusting the quiet build in fiction, and knowing the rich complexity of life will present itself if we, the readers, pay attention. So I’m thinking his Irish fiction selections must be attentive, too.***And now I shall be attentive to the winner of the Lost Man Booker Prize, to be awarded 40 years after the publication of the nominees, due to a shift-in-rules glitch back then, because Shirley Hazzard, one of my favorites, is on the list, although I have not read the nominated book, The Bay of Noon. She is on the short list, winner to be announced May 19, coming right up!!*Our “regular” (nothing to do with coffee) customer likes the idea of the Irish fiction anthology so she gets a preview of various authors before she spends time and/or money on longer works by someone she won’t like. She pointed to one of the authors listed on the cover and said he was “weird.”Names have been omitted to protect the unknown. The asterisk has been abused because I am linear-time challenged. I like coffee."},
{"title": "Doug's List", "date": "Sunday, May 16, 2010", "text": "Day 96 of the \"What are you reading, and why?\" project, and Douglas Post, a playwright, is, naturally, reading a lot of plays! Also nonfiction, literary classics, and personal ads.Doug spent 5 weeks in England this winter for the world premiere of Bloodshot, his one-man mystery play, commissioned and performed by Simon Slater, and well received at the Nuffield Theatre at Southampton. Doug’s play will now go on a British tour.While he was there Doug read the plays Enron by Lucy Prebble, The Line by Timberlake Wertenbaker, and The Pitman Painters by Lee Hall. “The first,” Doug reports, “is about the rise and fall of the American energy conglomerate. The second and third are about painters and their wares. I also read About Stoppard: the Playwright & the Work by Jim Hunter, which is exactly as it sounds, and National Service by Richard Eyre, which is Mr. Eyre’s diary of the ten years he spent as Artistic Director of the National Theatre.” Doug continued his theatre reading when he got back to the States: “I reread Stoppard’s Every Good Boy Deserves Favor, which I had seen performed with actors, dancers, and a large orchestra at the National, and Professional Foul, which is a teleplay and highly political. Actually, both scripts are political, which is unusual for this writer. I then found myself rereading Arthur Miller’s After the Fall and Tennessee Williams’s Camino Real. Both works were condemned in their time, but are now largely considered to be classics.”Now he’s reading some fiction—The Ghost Writer, by Robert Harris. When I first saw the title, I flashed on Philip Roth’s The Ghost Writer, which I have read, but it’s a different Ghost Writer, and I see that’s a popular title indeed, and titles can’t be copyrighted. A guy with a great CD collection, Doug is also reading some music history, The House That Trane Built: The Story of Impulse Records by Ashley Kahn. “I haven’t read anything else by Mr. Harris, but have read two other works by Mr. Kahn. One was about the making of Miles Davis's Kind of Blue and the other was about John Coltrane’s A Love Supreme. For the record, pun intended, Mr. Kahn is a wonderful writer. As is Mr. Harris.”For those of you who are too young, a record is a round thing. You put a needle on it, spin it around, and music comes out. Trust me, Doug is funnier than I am. I just think I’m funny. For instance, “For fun, I’ve been reading They Call Me Naughty Lola aloud to my wife and family,\" says Doug. \"This is a collection of personal ads from the London Review of Books. Hysterical stuff.” But he’s not kidding. He really is reading that book aloud to his family!Doug has also “started putting together this summer’s list of ‘Ten Books That I Should Have Read In School.’ Last summer, I got through seven. Wish me luck.”Here’s Doug’s List:Winesburg, Ohio by Sherwood AndersonThe Stranger by Albert CamusThe Big Money by John Dos PassosCrime and Punishment by Fyodor DostoevskyAs I Lay Dying by William FaulknerA Pair of Blue Eyes by Thomas HardyLady Chatterley’s Lover by D. H. LawrenceBabbitt by Sinclair LewisLove in the Time of Cholera by Gabriel Garcia MarquezThe Fountainhead by Ayn RandDoug says, “I only got through D.H. Lawrence and so will start with Sinclair Lewis this summer. However, I did read Robert Fagles's translation of The Iliad this winter, so I think that counts for something.”That does count for something! Let’s wish him luck.And what are 10 Books YOU Should Have Read in School?"},
{"title": "After Many a Book", "date": "Saturday, May 15, 2010", "text": "Day 95 of the \"What are you reading, and why?\" project, and it's possible that I should not try to do this for 365 days because 1) readership has declined and/or 2) commentship has declined (where is Mike Peterson?!), but mainly because 3) I might be going a little crazy:I have started to notice what fictional characters are reading!! Of course Franny was reading The Way of the Pilgrim, and this was crucial to the plot of Franny and Zooey, and maybe part of the hermit-style madness of J.D. Salinger (I resemble that remark), but this is something else.I noticed that Monica Geller was reading Practical Intuition in Love by Laura Day in an old episode of Friends, as my teenage kids have discovered this series. She had the big red-orange-with-a-rose hardcover, dark yellow lettering, but I have linked you to a handy paperback copy if you, too, want to have Monica's frequently-between-boyfriends love life and then end up with the boy next door.And George, in A Single Man, is course reading After Many a Summer, by Aldous Huxley, a kind of Hollywood fantasy satire. In the film, he is reading an elegant hardcover, evidently the very first edition of 1939, before the title changed to After Many a Summer Dies the Swan, in the very next printing later that year. I can't even find a picture of that one, except at Wikipedia, which appears to have fewer stripes than the one in the film, but there are many copies out there, ranging from $21 to over $200, and many affordable copies in later hardback and softcover editions. Even the first American edition includes this addition to the title, a quotation from a Tennyson poem, so George must have brought his copy from London!See, it can't be a good thing that I am this wrapped up in books and their editions, so that I am speculating on the lives of fictional characters, what they are reading, and why.But George is reading a book about a man who is afraid of death and obsessed with youth, and it's a bitterly comic novel, showing the folly of it all. And he has read it closely, which is interesting to ponder, after having seen the film. Now I am going to have to read this book. Believe me, I already checked Babbitt's for the pulp fiction cover."},

Jennifer, who is writing a novel of her own, has been reading Stephen King novels ever since she read On Writing in 2008 and liked his writing advice. I liked his writing advice, too, and I see an anniversary edition coming out in July.Jennifer has read 20 novels during this King binge, but she did not like all of them. She threw Desperation at the wall. She made an actual dent in the wall where she threw it, so that is where she throws other books she doesn't like.Like the last book in the Dark Tower series. She threw that. No spoilers, as I haven't read any of them, and she carefully refrained from saying why. But that other guy I talked to said you either love it or hate it. (I think he threw his copy, too!)Jennifer has also been reading Jack Kerouac and likes him a lot, even though \"he never met a comma.\"And yesterday a young woman came in looking for The Catcher in the Rye.

{"title": "Post Mother's Dayism, To Say Something of the Son", "date": "Wednesday, May 12, 2010", "text": "Day 92 of the \"What are you reading, and why?\" project. Oh, the sweetest thing happened!--a mother-son story. I will tell you about it, and about what Curt is reading.Curt is reading a lot of science fiction, because he grew up on it. His mother was in the science-fiction-book-of-the-month-club, so he grew up on the classics--Burroughs, Verne, Asimov, Bradbury, etc.. After he had read a book, his mother would make a pot of tea, and they'd sit down and talk about it.\"What was it about?\" his mother would ask. At first, he would start in on the plot, but she'd say, \"No, what was it really about?\" and they'd talk about ideas, and character motivations, and the real stuff of life, as handled in science fiction, which can go anywhere. Go anywhere they did, in these conversations! So he understood science fiction and fantasy not as escape-from-life reading, not as diversion or entertainment, but as deep immersion in the true stuff of life. \"She got me through my master's degree,\" said Curt. \"I never took a formal course in literary analysis in college. Because of these conversations, I just knew how to read literature.\"Yay! (This reminds me of the Great Books Chicago event I told you about in here, with regular people from all walks of life gathering to talk about readings in common, and, indeed, the Great Books Foundation's Great Conversations series of anthologies.)So now Curt enjoys the \"alternative histories\" and \"future histories\" of writers like Bruce Sterling and Connie Willis. (And I know Rebecca will agree about Connie Willis, whose books keep \"following [Rebecca] home\" from the library!)Curt recently enjoyed To Say Nothing of the Dog by Connie Willis, its title taking a phrase from Three Men in a Boat, by Jerome K. Jerome (a book that Julie keeps telling me about). So much to read, so much to read! According to Curt, Willis writes regularly about \"serious time travel as an academic pursuit\" and this book involves rebuilding Coventry Cathedral, and therefore time-travel visits to Victorian England, medieval times, and World War II, to say nothing of the future."},
{"title": "Peculiar Crimes of the (Cross Out Fart) Heart", "date": "Tuesday, May 11, 2010", "text": "Day 91 of the \"What are you reading, and why?\" project. Gus has been reading The Victoria Vanishes: a Peculiar Crimes Unit Mystery in the series by Christopher Fowler, because someone in Babbitt's, probably Jo, recommended it. \"It's a scream!\" said Gus, who also really enjoyed \"the smarmy look on the author's face\" in his photo on the book jacket. I don't know if it's the same photo as on Fowler's author page at Amazon, and I probably don't fully know what \"smarmy\" means, but the guy looks really satisfied with his success.These books sound hilarious, just the thing if you love mystery and comedy. The only mystery I have read since my Nancy Drew days was The Daughter of Time, by Josephine Tey, also recommended by someone formerly at Babbitt's, Julie--about the mystery of Richard III--so maybe I should try some Christopher Fowler. (And, of course, the Stieg Larsson, waiting on the shelf.)Almost all of us at Babbitt's are soon to be formerly, as it's a tough time for independent bookstores, as we all know. We were noticing, though, that people are buying $4 hardbacks out the wazoo, as that is still a great deal. (I don't really know what a \"wazoo\" is, either, but I vaguely recall an actual conversation about its likely offensive connotations--sorry!--and its inoffensive resemblance to a kazoo.) Hmm, a comedy/mystery occurs to me: The Personnel Vanishes, set in a bookstore. Employees keep mysteriously dying, so the boss doesn't have to fire them. Or set fire to them. The plot quickens. Subtitle: Up in Smoke, or Out the Wazoo.I have too much fun in life.Gus also loved Just Kids, Patti Smith's memoir, just out in January. I should read it to find out how to transform myself, as one review says, \"from a poet to a rock star,\" or at least to the girl singer in my imaginary band, Midlife Crisis.I have too much fun in my head.Really, I should read this, as I have always wanted to know more about Patti Smith's romance with playwright Sam Shepard, and I have seen the astonishing and controversial photography of her first lover and dear friend Robert Mapplethorpe. The book is also a tribute to him.So maybe if it comes in to Babbitt's, before I go out (the wazoo), I will!"},
{"title": "What's Cricket in Netherland?", "date": "Monday, May 10, 2010", "text": "Day 90 of the \"What are you reading, and why?\" project. Willemina, who is from The Netherlands, is reading Netherland, by Joseph O'Neill, because it was a Christmas gift and because it won the PEN/Faulkner Award for Fiction.Not because Joseph O'Neill is really handsome. I am the one mentioning that. I have my reasons....When I asked Willemina about the meaning of \"Netherland\" in the title, she said it has multiple meanings, relating indeed to The Netherlands (as the narrator is Dutch), going \"down below\" as into deep stuff under the surface of life and into the psyche, and to a place between two worlds. There is cultural displacement in this novel--a character from Holland and his wife from England displaced to New York and then from their current home, due to 9/11. There is a character from the Underworld of crime, who goes to the underworld of death. This is not a spoiler, as it happens up front in a novel of flashblacks, and even the reviews tell us of this character's death. They also mention the similarities to The Great Gatsby in this regard!And there's a lot of cricket. Maybe too much cricket for Willemina, who says she doesn't know the game well enough to get all the sybolism of cricket in the novel, but maybe that won't matter as she continues to read. The narrator plays cricket with other immigrants to the U.S. but in a less \"polite\" version of the famously gentlemanly game.Speaking of international sports and famous gentlemen, I lent my current issue of Vanity Fair, the one with handsome shirtless World Cup soccer players on the cover, to my friend Kim. No further comment. From me. On World Cup quality men. I only mention it because Vanity Fair is a print magazine to which I currently subscribe...because of the great articles, yeah. No, really. And I always want to know what print magazines people are reading. Or drooling over."},
{"title": "Not So Random Strangers", "date": "Sunday, May 9, 2010", "text": "Day 89 of the \"What are you reading, and why?\" project. A not-so-random stranger--that is, a young man who is familiar to me, because he comes in the store often--is reading some Daniel Quinn. I'm pretty sure the book he chose this time was The Story of B, sort of a sequel to Ishmael, because I remember the snail cover and the subtitle, An Adventure of the Mind and Spirit, but I might be mistaken, as I have been looking at the Daniel Quinn page at Amazon, and now all the covers are vaguely familiar.Like all the people in my town! It's nice to live in a place long enough that all the people look familiar and not like strangers. Oddly, this happens when I return to Chicago for a visit, too. Everybody looks familiar, as do the houses, neighborhoods, and flowers in the median strips, and it's like I never left. Then, say, at the zoo, I will see somebody who looks super familiar, and it will turn out to be somebody from the small town I live in now.I have not yet read Ishmael, borrowed from my dad because he is modeling a novel structure on it--that is, the kind of novel that is a way to present the author's philosophical ideas. I think it is OK to say that, as I think that is exactly what the both of them are doing, or want to do, and I think my dad is up front about that.Me, I am 1) not a novelist, though 2) I have the usual novel-in-progress that many writers keep in a drawer/computer file, and 3) every time I look it over, I think, \"Hey, I want to know what happens next!\" which is 4) probably a good thing, and might mean I actually finish it someday, but 5) probably not, because 6) I no longer believe in linear time, and most people do, and 7) poetry uses a different part of the brain. 7 seems a good place to stop this paragraph.But I have been musing on that novel as thinly-disguised-autobiography thing again. I hate that! I mean, it's OK, and I am always interested to learn the \"where I got that novel\" story behind a novel, from the novelist, but thinly disguising one's autobiography, especially when used to snipe at people, just annoys me and seems to lack imagination. Plus, it confuses people, especially aspiring writers, who then think that \"Write what you know\" just means write a story or novel that is thinly-disguised autobiography. It also confuses readers, some of whom think that every single novel ever written is actually real life with the names changed.Tony keeps calling In Cold Blood a novel, and Truman Capote is surely a self-absorbed author who did that sniping kind of thing, but he openly sniped, in other works, and In Cold Blood is \"a non-fiction novel,\" a new thing in journalism at the time, about things that really happened, in places and with names that are not fictionalized. That this kind of thing exists, a hybrid form, surely led the way to the recent confusions involving \"fictionalized memoirs,\" or whatever we should call them--fictions presented in the form of memoirs, because the sensationalism of real life...sells. Sigh.That said, I notice that Salinger has a persistent dead brother in the background in his fictions, and John Irving, likewise, has motifs of loss and wrestling, and plot patterns, etc. that probably relate in some way 1) to his real life and 2) to bestseller status (repeat what sells), and both of them had to find a way to 1) make a living and 2) live with themselves (or not) while doing it.I was even reminded at the recent discussion of The Scarlet Letter in Chicago that Nathaniel Hawthorne may have had a dalliance with a woman stikingly like Hester Prynne...which makes him, what, as measly and weak and eloquent and angelic and hypocritical as the Reverend Arthur Dimmesdale? But I can prefer to think that while feminist Margaret Fuller may indeed have been a model for Hester's character, there didn't have to be a dalliance for that to be so.I can also prefer to believe, about \"The Custom-House,\" the essay that precedes The Scarlet Letter, that Hawthorne really did find a folded-up fabric letter \"A,\" and that this really was the inspiration for the novel! I can prefer to believe almost anything."},
{"title": "Girl in Translation", "date": "Saturday, May 8, 2010", "text": "Day 88 of the \"What are you reading, and why?\" project. I don't know anyone who is reading this book right now. If you are, let me know.I just love the cover and the title, and I use it as an example of the ongoing hope, despite the expression to the contrary, that you could judge a book by its cover!You can learn more about Girl in Translation, by Jean Kwok, at Amazon, where you can even click a link to hear the author talk about it. And here's where I'd like to clarify something. This is not a \"monetized\" blog. Every now and then, I get a message from this site telling me that if I link to Amazon, as I often do, I can monetize my blog and take a cut whenever someone clicks the link here and buys the book there. Aauugghh!I link to Amazon because it is easy for you to get info there, you can choose various formats and prices, and because they offer Marketplace options for used copies, etc. If I link to a used bookstore's copy of the book, and it sells, the link will no longer be useful, but Amazon will usually have other options. So that's that, housekeeping and full disclosure.I will soon be reading, for my book group, Hotel on the Corner of Bitter and Sweet, by Jamie Ford, another book with the idea of \"translation\" from one culture to another in the background. In Girl in Translation, a girl from China has to adapt to her new life in the United States. In Hotel on the Corner of Bitter and Sweet, a Chinese-American man recalls young love in recent history, with a Japanese-American girl. Both contain coming-of-age themes, which can be, of course, bitter and sweet.And that is certainly true of The Catcher in the Rye, by J. D. Salinger, one of the great almost-ready-to-come-of-age novels of all time! It makes me feel like I am almost ready to come of age, too, and reminds me why I am still childlike at heart and can't really grow up. Sorry! Anyway, I did just finish re-reading that, because it was time. I had loved re-reading Franny and Zooey, so I thought I should return to Catcher in the Rye, recently read by the SOB book group, as noted earlier here.Holden Caulfield is a kind of \"boy in translation\" to adulthood, having some trouble confronting the crap of real life, with its constant \"phoniness\" and lying (of which he partakes) and the awful truth that the strong beat up on the weak, and can't help themselves. None of them can. The strong can't help but beat up on the weak, and the weak can't help themselvees against the strong. Plus, stuff happens, life has cliffs, and that's why we need catchers in the rye.But, of course, the novel also suggests that we can help ourselves, and each other, and should. So, daily, I am going to re-dedicate myself to that idea, which, again, is why I read: to learn how to live in this world, and to be as decent a human being as I can be.I will try not to judge a book by its cover, if that \"book\" is a human being, but only gently open it and turn the pages, by asking questions and listening. Sometimes it turns out to be heavy reading, indeed, and sometimes the content remains mysterious; sometimes I can't read the language nor find a good translation, and sometimes I have to walk away. But mostly people are wonderful to get to know.And books are wonderful to read!"},
{"title": "The Christ Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest", "date": "Friday, May 7, 2010", "text": "Day 87 of the \"What are you reading, and why?\" project. Kim is reading Saving Jesus from the Church, by Robin R. Meyers, because she is interested in Jesus the man.\"Zooey would like it,\" says Kim, referring to Franny and Zooey, by J. D. Salinger, which we recently read together in our book group. (And, yes, this is yesterday's Kim, the same Kim of Hummus Anonymous, the blog.) \"I'm not sure about Willie B.\"The \"Willie B.\" Kim is referring to is William B. Irvine, author of A Guide to the Good Life: The Ancient Art of Stoic Joy, reviewed recently by James Fulcher in The Common Review. I was telling her about the book in the context of classical Stoicism as a way of making the best of life's suffering, and finding peace and equanimity with whatever is at hand.For Jesus, of course, the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand. In my view, it is at hand in the present moment. (But, as I've mentioned, I don't believe in linear time...so all we have is the present moment, and that's not so far from existentialism, either. Topic for another day.)According to Kim, in reference to Saving Jesus from the Church, \"The premise of the book seems to be that followers of Jesus the man are getting it right, whereas 'believers' in Christ the Savior are not.\" I'm thinking followers of Jesus the man are in touch with their Stoic joy, their Buddhist suffering, and also that they understand the value and risk of practicing what you preach. But I will have to read the book to find out.Or ask the man himself. Kim also reports that \"the author Robin Meyers will likely be here in the fall to speak, sign books (a new one coming out) and lead workshops. \"Meanwhile, Amazon tells me you can now pre-order The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest, by Stieg Larsson, in hardcover, and/or get it in various formats (Kindle, Large Print, or imported). The movie of the first book in the series is coming to our town, before Robin Meyers comes to town, and is already playing in a nearby town, and has freaked out an area blogger, Julie, due to its violence. Here is her review of The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo.And I think Zooey would also like the Irvine book, and understand the Stoic joy thing, because Epictetus is in it, and he was a big Stoic. But Zooey is a fictional character, and so is Biff, Jesus's childhood friend, a fellow I rely on to tell me most of what I know about Jesus the man. I'm pretty sure my research has something to be desired.But watch out. According to some, desire is the cause of all suffering. (I think they might have it a little wrong... Desire is fine. The problem is thinking you can attain/obtain everything you desire. Ah, another topic for another day! Heh heh, leave 'em wanting more.)"},

Robert has finished Supreme Power, by Jeff Shesol, and moved on to Empire of Liberty, by Gordon S. Wood. Whew! Robert reads a lot! And he reads an amazing variety of books--these are history, but, if you read this blog fairly regularly, and also his comments, you see is also a connoisseur of mystery!The Shesol book, as the subtitle tells us, is about Franklin Roosevelt vs. the Supreme Court, and the interactions of the President, the Senate, the judiciary, and the New Deal. It's complicated. Whoa. Oddly, the current Amazon page for Supreme Power also has a pictorial ad for It's Complicated (on blu-ray & DVD), showing Meryl Streep in bed with Alec Baldwin. Politics: who's in bed with whom, eh?Speaking of legal tangles and past Presidents, I just learned from the blog Hummus Anonymous that today is the National Day of Prayer, thanks to Harry S Truman. (If you click the link you may 1) drool over the list of Cinco de Mayo party foods, and 2) be reminded of the ironies of U.S. citizens celebrating a minor Mexican holiday with margaritas...in the Midwest and, of course, Arizona. (These links may also 1) make you a fan of Kim, blogger, and 2) addict you to hummus.)Empire of Liberty is about (its subtitle:) A History of the Early Republic, 1789-1815, by a scholar of the American Revolution, and is Volume 8 in the Oxford History of the United States. I have a feeling Robert will read the entire series! It looks closely at that crucial and confusing time after the astounding American political revolution toward personal liberty to see if the new Constitution and its republic can indeed survive. The year 1789 reminds us of the French Revolution and the danger of excess, chaos, and confusion when people throw off the powers that oppress them. Wood documents a more peaceful enactment of a political system founded on respect for personal liberty.Again, it's complicated, and, again, the movie ad appears, a movie I saw with blogger Kim, as a matter of fact, in the wild world of wacky coincidence and random hummus!"},
{"title": "Poems and Plays", "date": "Wednesday, May 5, 2010", "text": "Day 85 of the \"What are you reading, and why?\" project. I am reading Poems & Plays, because I'm in it! I do love to have poems in a literary journal, because then, when the contributor copy arrives, I get to read poems and stories and essays by all the other writers in it, too, or, in this case, poems and plays!Yesterday's entry included a gushing of lush spring beauty, and this one must include a gushing of praise for both the contents and the cover of this issue. You see the gorgeous roses, but this is full summer's lush beauty, fading and wilting, after being cut and enjoyed indoors in glass. Oh, the gorgeous dripping of the helpless petals. Ah, vanitas!In fact, vanitas seems to be shedding the only light on the subject of roses, by way of a pull chain! This cover is a painting by Barry Buxkamper called Vanitas: Flora (2009, watercolor on paper), and I hope it is OK to reproduce it here! (I guess he or the Poems & Plays editor, Gaylord Brewer, will let me know if it isn't, but generally people want to get magazine covers out there to entice people to buy the magazine! And/or the painting! Which, if I could afford it, I would buy! Hmm...it is possible to buy paintings over time. I remember a young woman bought one of my husband's paintings over 5 years, in faithful random installments! And I bought one of Lauren Levato's paintings that way, thanks to an arrangement with Woman Made Gallery in Chicago, where it was exhibited. All is not vanitas! One can enjoy beauty, and find meaning in it! And have I mentioned how much I love watercolor?--the perfect medium for these fading petals, this blurry light...sigh....)Anyhow, now to gush on the book inside the cover. I was delighted to find one of my poems, \"Excursion into Poetry,\" across the way from James Doyle, \"Meeting Under the Streetlight,\" a sly, sexy poem that ends in a delightful faithfulness. We took some James Doyle poems for RHINO, back when I was an editor there, and I also got to review his book, Einstein Considers a Sand Dune (Steel Toe Books, 2004). His wife, Sharon Doyle, is also a wonderful poet!Poems by Albert Haley--\"The Bottom Line Is\" and \"Reduction in Force\"--work not only as poems but also as social criticism, and the man fired (\"crucified\") in \"Reduction in Force\" reminds me of all those people who lost their jobs in the U.S. recently, and on the big screen in Up in the Air. Likewise, Suzanne Roberts let us imagine \"Apocalypse at the Safeway,\" with its looting of exotic vegetables.As the title tells us, this journal also carries short plays, so we have The Crucifixion of Moe and Ira, a 10-minute play by Lynn-Steven Johanson, and Geek, by Crystal Skillman, which takes place at a comic book convention.And Poems & Plays publishes within it the winner of the annual Tennessee Chapbook Prize, this year, The Hard Grammar of Gratitude, by Judith Sornberger, which indeed finds many hard things to be grateful for, because life isn't easy.I had picked up my mail as I headed to work the other day when this issue arrived, so I showed it to my boss, who said, \"Oh, William Trowbridge! I know him,\" about one of the contributors. I leave you with a couplet, the opening image, from his poem, \"A Small Bouquet of Poets\":Here's Roethke: big pinkpeony bouncing in the breeze.Because peonies are in bud and will be bouncing in the breeze very soon!"},

Karen is reading Prodigal Summer, by Barbara Kingsolver, after reading The Poisonwood Bible with her book group. I hope she will comment here on what her book group thought of Poisonwood Bible, as they were also looking into another book mysteriously similar in construction, as I recall!Karen is my neighbor, so I know we are both experiencing the spring-as-herald-of-summer- coming-on in its full Midwestern lushness. The grass is tall, violets are spreading, dandelions are rampant. Karen and I both like dandelions; they are pretty, and you can eat them. Our other neighbors are not so fond of dandelions, so it's best to dig them out or mow before they get to the wish-puff seed stage.Of course, most of the other neighbors use pesticides and lawn services. We do not. Rabbits love it here. (And I expect a return of praying mantis, Karen!) The lawn service guy for the neighbor on the north now scoots some of his little pesticide balls into our side yard, but it's OK, and he hasn't killed any lily-of-the-valley, oh so sweetly blooming right now, along with the mountain bluets.Blue hosta and two-toned hosta are thriving, their leaves jubilant, raucous. Clematis is opening on the fence, while the bleeding heart is dripping to earth. On Mother's Day weekend I'll choose a few more blooming plants for the garden beds--from a Kiwanis fundraiser garden event that will send kids to camp--and then just try to keep up with the weeding and gentle maintenance of perennials. Next, if they are as astonishingly accommodating-to-the-printed-human-calendar as last year, day lilies will start opening, right on time, starting June 21, the first day of summer. Wasn't there going to be some talk of a book? Yes! Prodigal Summer is set in Appalachia, with plants and bugs and coyotes. I fondly recall a big fallen hollow tree. The neighbor/pesticide issue weaves into the plot. Here's a book you can judge by its cover (pictured above) and its beautful endpapers, illustrated with moths, including the lovely green Luna."},
{"title": "The Underground Grammarian", "date": "Monday, May 3, 2010", "text": "Day 83 of the \"What are you reading, and why?\" project. Gary, a perpetual reader, is perennially reading The Gift of Fire, a book of essays by Richard Mitchell. He read aloud from his paperback copy of it Sunday morning, over coffee, to delight some houseguests.Richard Mitchell is the beloved founder of The Underground Grammarian, \"an unauthorized journal devoted to the protection of the Mother Tongue,\" and is the Underground Grammarian himself (rest in peace). You can read (and freely plagiarize from) all of The Underground Grammarian online, but I am crediting him here, using quotation marks (or italics in the extended quotation below), and encouraging you to read the various books available in print format, as well, because that's what I do here.I think Mitchell would forgive me for my curling of the Mother Tongue here in my goofy blog, but heaven forbid I should commit some of my grammatical errors in formal writing or in print! He would, if alive, stick out his tongue at me.Because permission is given at the Underground Grammarian website, I will quote a hefty hunk of his practical advice on what, beyond sticking out your tongue, literally or figuratively, you, too, can do when you witness abuse of the English language:What Can We Do?The Underground Grammarian does not advocate violence; it advocates ridicule. Abusers of English are often pompous, and ridicule hurts them more than violence. In every edition we will bring you practical advice for ridiculing abusers of English. This month's target is any barbarian who says advisement. We can advise, or give advice, or even do some advising. Advisement permits nothing beyond what we can already mean with the words we have. Perhaps, by analogy to confinement, it might name a condition in which we suffer the consequence of having been advised; or, like government, it might indicate some cloud of loosely related abstractions and institutions. Those who say it to us must simply mean advising, but they fear that a clear naming of what they do will reveal how little it needs doing, and they will find themselves in the streets selling wind-up toys. Such people feel degraded unless what they do ends with -ment or some other official sound such as -ation or -ivity. Work that ends with -ing makes them nervous.Do not boo and stamp your feet when some barbarian says advisement; it will bring reprisal, for barbarians are vindictive. Simply mutter, just loud enough to be heard, \"Clickety-click-click.\" This requires no lip movement and suggests a wind-up toy. With a female barbarian, an equally good response is \"Ding-dong,\" familiar to all television-addicted barbarians and suggesting some more appropriate career in cosmetics.When advisement appears in a document sent by campus mail, smear it with something foul and return it to the sender.Do NOT take this under advisement. As ever, happy reading!"},
{"title": "Brainage a Trois", "date": "Sunday, May 2, 2010", "text": "Days 80, 81, and 82 of the \"What are you reading, and why?\" project. I promised you a three-in-one blog entry to make up for the 3 days I was off to Chicago with the brainy set. Here is a sampling of what people who like to get together and talk about books are reading and talking about:Ann is reading Crime & Punishment, by Fyodor Dostoyevsky, with her Toronto book group and having 4 dicussions of it. As it's written in 6 sections, they are reading 2 at a time, then discussing what they've read, and then meeting a final time to discuss the work as a whole. Gary remembers this one fondly as the first great Russian novel he ever read.Gary & Pat went to Chile, shortly after the earthquake, with other readers to read and discuss works by Isabel Allende, Pablo Neruda, and other writers, and to reflect on Chile's troubled history, torture in specific. They read poems, Nobel Prize acceptance speeches, various essays, excerpts from Freud's Civilization and its Discontents, and Allende's novel The House of the Spirits. Lindsay is reading Aliens in the Prime of Their Lives, by Brad Watson, a book of short stories, because she is a short story writer herself and reads all the stories she can. She got her copy at the recent AWP (Association of Writers & Writing Programs) conference in Denver, and it is signed by the author! It is realistic literary fiction, not science fiction, despite the \"aliens\" in the title.Wendy and her poetry reading group in Texas are reading Milton's Paradise Lost, the great poem. Like Ann's group, they are reading and discussing it in parts. Usually they read shorter poems, several at a time by a single poet, working their way through various time periods. Recently they read works by Thomas Campion, an English poet of the Renaissance, who also wrote songs and composed music.And Lorel and her book group in Oak Park recently read John Steinbeck's Cannery Row, to see how that generation got through its Depression. Now they are reading Cider with Rosie, recommended by a British woman in the group who assures them this is \"a beloved British book.\" It is a memoir by Laurie Lee, first published in 1959. Laurie Lee is a man, raised by women, and evidently beloved by women as well.They also recently read Crossing to Safety by Wallace Stegner, which Lorel appreciated for its beautiful writing, even though the plot frustrated her because it was dominated by a domineering woman.And that brings us back to Angle of Repose, Stegner's famous novel of the American West, and my desire to go there, to New Mexico in specific, and to discuss it, the New Mexican landscape, and paintings by Georgia O'Keeffe in a wonderful program called The American Southwest: The Power of Place, offered by Classical Pursuits, a company specializing in travel and literature, based in Toronto. Sigh...But, just back from visiting Chicago with this brainy set, I am too tired to plan any more travel or to say much more. I'm off to my own angle of repose."},
{"title": "Farewell to The Lost Sisterhood", "date": "Thursday, April 29, 2010", "text": "Day 79 of the \"What are you reading, and why?\" project. By the way, I will be gone for Days 80-82, discussing books with Great Books Chicago (pictured), but you can be sure I will ask people what they are reading, write it down, and post a three-for-one when I return.Previously on \"Wait! I Have a Blog!\": Kathleen accidentally signs up on blogger.com to comment on someone's blog. Wait! She has a blog! Months later, attempting to follow another blog, she accidentally follows herself. Meanwhile, in her day job in a bookstore, she spends her wages buying books. True, they're used, cheap,...and, wait! she has an employee discount! The point being, Kathleen sets aside for herself a book called The Lost Sisterhood: Prostitution in America, 1900-1918, by Ruth Rosen, mentions this in her blog, but has not yet completed the transaction, so it is still on the shelf behind her, when...in walks Kyle.OK, don't worry, I'm not going to do TV dialogue.Kyle is reading Panders and Their White Slaves, by Clifford Griffith Roe, which she was very pleased to find at Babbitt's, as it helps her with continuing research in this area. It's a book from 1910, and has been reprinted, as have other of his books, including The Girl Who Disappeared. Roe's work is also available free online, but, like me, Kyle likes to have the book in hand and on hand. Which is why I handed her my set-aside copy of The Lost Sisterhood. She was delighted. She has read it before but keeps getting it from the library to do her research. Now she has her very own paperback copy.Kyle is also reading Sundown Towns: A Hidden Dimension of American Racism, by James W. Loewen, which ties in to her women's studies/prostitution topic, but is primarily about the systematic exclusion of blacks from small towns, sometimes using the law and signage, and often using violence and ostracism. African Americans might visit or even work in a \"sundown town,\" but they'd better not still be there after dark.Back in 1909, the small town of Anna, Illinois ran all its black residents out of town virtually overnight after a crime in a town nearby. Loewen's books tracks the trend from the 1890s through the 1960s, when civil rights and fair housing activism helped change things, but, sadly, it lingers today in some areas.After we'd chatted a while, I asked Kyle if she'd read Sin in the Second City, by Karen Abbott, about brothels in Chicago and their demise in the late 19th and early-to-mid 20th centuries. (Oops, I think I called in Sex in the Second City....sigh. Anyway, I got Karen Abbott right.) \"He's probably in it,\" I said. Indeed, he is. (I had just forgotten his name!) He's one of the major crusaders against white slavery and brothels in Chicago. He was assistant state's attorney when he heard the account of Mona Marshall, who told him she was seduced, drugged, raped, forced into prostitution, and held against her will, without streetclothes, until one day she threw a note out a window and was rescued. The crusade began. Roe is a key figure in Abbott's book and Panders and other works are heavily cited.White slavery aside, Kyle and I both appreciate the complexities of prostitution as a profession. The brothels in Chicago were often run by women as successful businesses, a kind of women's empowerment. Women engaged in such entrepreneurship usually after circumstances that left them stranded and alone, needing to make a living. It's not an easy thing to sort out, and I wish Kyle well in her research project. OK, wish me well in the Second City, where I will try not to sin while discussing The Scarlet Letter, Endgame, and \"Sorrow-Acre.\" I'll tell you what else people are reading when I get back."},
{"title": "What Do Men Read?", "date": "Wednesday, April 28, 2010", "text": "Day 78 of the “What are you reading, and why?” project. Brian has been reading The History of White People, by Nell Irvin Painter. Why? For a men’s book group.Not the SOBs, another men’s book group you have read about earlier in this blog. It’s a different men’s book group altogether, though perhaps similarly made up of both academics and non-academics, men interested in history, sociology, politics, and big ideas.The History of White People is one author’s close look at issues of race and definition, bringing together philosophical, cultural, and historical takes on what race is and what it means to be “white.” Apparently, it is hard to say what race is; it’s a blurry thing.This book was published in March, 2010, and I notice it coincided with television documentaries & entertainments on race and heritage and of course with the United States Census, and its insistence on racial categories.I had trouble figuring out how to answer the Census questions, which did not, in the first place, seem clear on who I was to count as members of my household. Ultimately, I counted everyone in my nuclear family, even though my son is off at college, because he did happen to be home on April 1…and then we went to Ohio. Should we have been counted as part of my sister’s family? Have I mentioned that I am math-challenged? Anyway, my son was blurry on how his college would count him, so I counted him.And I did not know what race to call my children. My husband, though Hispanic, is officially white on the Census form, but descends from Spaniards and indigenous Cuban people, who are, what? to begin with, and who may have mixed with African black slaves, as well as Spaniards, like his grandfather, since they survived all the diseases that tended to kill off the natives with vulnerable immune systems.Likewise, what am I? Why does it matter?Well, it matters when those in power need it to matter. In The History of White People, Painter points out that Jews and Hispanics were considered “white” in time to fight in the front lines in World War II, afterwards enjoying more of their civil rights and less of the previously routine discrimination and prejudice, as Joseph Heller noticed, among other ironies (such as those found in Catch 22). Political equality happened later, and still not without struggle, for American blacks, as the army wasn’t fully integrated till the Korean War. The Vietnam War and the civil rights movement in the United States are naturally linked in this philosophy of the history of white people.All this and more came out in the men’s book group discussion, as summarized by Brian the second time I interviewed him, at work. (He’s my boss.) The men found Painter’s ancient history a little sparse, but accepted that this is an overview directed at a general audience, not a scholarly one, and that more information is readily available to interested readers. She spent some time discounting dubious race studies but left more valid explorations untouched, and thus open to further research and interpretation.Brian says she viewed earlier human divisions as tribalism instead of racism and suggests that the Enlightenment created racism. Essentially, the people in power, who were white, set up categories based on differences in appearance, and somehow arranged it so they themselves were on top. Not a big surprise. As Brian put it, summarizing her thesis, “There’s no such thing as race. It’s a cultural construction.”Brian gets to choose a book when his turn comes around again and might choose Black: The History of a Color, by Michel Pastoureau, who has also written about Blue, Heraldry, and the Devil’s Cloth in other art history books. Black: The History of a Color focuses specifically on Western art, exploring the nature of the color black, its symbolism and, as Brian explained it, its two main kinds, early on: shiny black and matte black. Shiny black, a reflective color, has positive qualities and connotations, and matte black, non-reflective, sucks up all the light and is connected to death and evil and other troubling things. People get them mixed up, different cultures use black in different ways, and color trends change, but maybe Black: The History of a Color can make a few things clearer, at least in terms of uses and perceptions of the color black in Western culture and art."},
{"title": "What Do Women Read?", "date": "Tuesday, April 27, 2010", "text": "Day 77 of the “What are you reading, and why?” project. Regular readers of this blog know that:1) Women read the same things men read…2) ...except there is “chick lit” and “dick lit” (or, if you are British or more polite, “lad lit”);3) I ask this question in the context of just having attended a women’s retreat and asked various women what they are reading, and…4) I will surely give equal time to men and ask, “What Do Men Read?” tomorrow…or the next day, in this same rhetorical, for-the-sake-of-a-blog-title way.To return to Mary Beth and Pam, who do a lot of reading:Mary Beth, who loves politics and current events, recently read Game Change, by John Heilemann and Mark Halperin, both journalists, about, as the subtitle states, Obama and the Clintons, McCain and Palin, and the Race of a Lifetime, from the insiders’ point of view. The authors revealed the gritty truth about all the candidates, and, according to Mary Beth, the only one who came out smelling like a rose was Michelle Obama. Mary Beth said the reasoned, objective, and humorous approach did not prepare her for the emotional ending, and she found herself in tears on the last page.Pam had recently read The Cellist of Sarajevo, by Steven Galloway, a novel based on the real cellist, Vedron Smailovic, who risked his life in wartime to play an adagio day after day in memory of the dead. Art as quiet heroism, and more cause for tears.Pam is now reading a gentle memoir called Growing Up in Holmen [Wisconsin], by Arlan Helgeson, a local retired dean and history professor, because:1) he is the age of her parents, and it’s like learning about them;2) he is local and handy, and she wants her book group to read the book and then go over and talk to him;3) she was able to borrow a friend’s copy of a hard-to-find book…!And Mary Beth is now reading a novel recommended by a friend. The Whistling Season, by Ivan Doig, is set in Montana toward the end of its one-room schoolhouse era. Mary Beth says it was slow going at first, but now she is really into it and likes its simplicity and authenticity.So, as always, what are you reading?"},
{"title": "Hungers, Spoken and Unspoken", "date": "Monday, April 26, 2010", "text": "Day 76 of the \"What are you reading, and why?\" project. Ruth is reading An Unpoken Hunger, by Terry Tempest Williams, because she shares this author's love of the earth.At the women's retreat I attended this weekend, Ruth called me over to read aloud from the book, \"Home is the range of one's instincts,\" a sort of roving definition that expanded the territory of my mind for the rest of the day. I pondered the instincts, first, of our rescued stray cat in Chicago, whose nocturnal territory was wide but who came home every morning for food and love; when we moved, and as he aged, he made his territory smaller, staying indoors more and more, finally preferring to sleep in my hair.I pondered the instinct to return home, followed by so many writers and artists, sometimes occasioned by damages in the wider world, or the recognition of various and real internal fragilities and radical uncertainities. Even yesterday's Mennonite in a Little Black Dress has this theme, this circumstance, announced in its subtitle: A Memoir of Going Home.The Williams quotation echoes that song I loved as a child, so the phrase, \"Home, home on the range\" sang inside me for a while, and its evocation of a wilderness home, a roaming home, and a paradox of no-home-but-longing, or no-home-but-movement.An unspoken hunger gnaws at our bellies, many of us.But not Marie, who is reading Everything Tastes Better with Bacon, by Sara Perry. Its cover, a fabulous 3-decker BLT, made a lot of us drool, though not the vegetarians.Marie confessed that, as of the time her husband got the results of his cholesterol tests, she is also reading Low-Fat, Low-Cholesterol Cooking, 4th Edition, Delicious Recipes to Help You Lower Your Cholesterol, offered by the American Heart Association.Marie really does read cookbooks the way some of us read novels--voraciously! And reading does not have cholesterol or calories. Cooking is Marie's creative outlet, and the books give her inspiration as well as practical knowledge and advice."},
{"title": "Two for One", "date": "Sunday, April 25, 2010", "text": "Days 74 & 75 of the \"What are you reading, and why?\" project. I've been off at a women's retreat, asking women what they are reading.Peg is reading Too Much Happiness by Alice Munro. Why?1) She loves Alice Munro, and has read her stories over the years in books and journals and has given them to her daughters. I know because I am one of her daughters!2) She was in Barnes & Noble and saw it on the shelf, realized she still had $ on her gift card from her son and daughter-in-law from Christmas, and thought, \"Oh! I'll get a hardback!\"Right after I had this little discussion with Peg aka Mom, Susan sat down near us, the same Susan who has decided to pronounce Zooey as ZO-ee, and who was a little put out that I had not yet put her in this blog as being someone who was reading The Help by Kathryn Stockett.\"I will now,\" I said.\"Well, I'm not reading it now,\" she said. (I almost said \"she pouted\" but you are only supposed to say \"said\" when rendering dialogue.) \"I'm done.\" \"Well, I hadn't really had a chance to ask you why you were reading it,\" I said. \"Why were you?\"\"I was in Barnes & Noble,\" she said, \"and I had a gift card, so I went ahead and got it in hardback.\"Twilight Zone music.Susan had been waiting for The Help to come out in paperback, and had even asked the bookseller about the likely date, but there isn't one, not as long as it selling so well in hardback. That's how the industry works, causing a lot of hardbacks to be remaindered, as people hold out for the paperbacks, due to cost and convenience (easier/lighter to carry around). But then there's a hardback like The Help that everybody wants to read now. It's out in Kindle and audio formats, and available to pre-order in large-print paperback...but no regular trade paperback yet.Next morning I learned that Mary Beth and Pam had also recently read The Help and really enjoyed and learned a lot from it. The \"help\" are the black maids raising white children in homes and communities where they are subjected to routine disrespect and indignities. Mary Beth, interested from a young age in politics and current events, vividly remembered the civil rights issues so crucial to this novel, and, of course, the assassinations of Medgar Evars and Martin Luther King, Jr. Pam felt she led a more sheltered young life and realized she was as unaware as some of the white women depicted in the novel of the important events going on all around her. I'll tell you more about what Pam and Mary Beth are reading tomorrow...or the next day.For now, I want to say that Susan is currently reading Mennonite in a Little Black Dress, by Rhoda Janzen, a memoir, because her mom picked it up at Borders with a sale coupon and because Elizabeth Gilbert, of Eat, Pray, Love liked it.So mothers and daughters are reading and sharing books about women here, not the chick lit sort, but the coping with real life sort. The Lives of Girls and Women sort. My book group read that novel by Alice Munro, and my mom says the stories in Too Much Happiness (which I can now borrow from her, in hardback!) are rich and complicated indeed.\"There's one I've read through twice already, and I'm still not sure I got it,\" she said.And I'm not sure I get what happened when I passed through the room and found a woman dangling a pendulum over another woman flat on the floor at the retreat. She explained it was part of her work with energy and healing touch. In some spots the pendulum was still, in some spinning in gentle circles, and in others moving side to side. After the woman on the floor got up, I said, \"Can I try it?\" and she dangled the pendulum over me. It went crazy, spinning everywhere in wild dancing circles and apparently I have wide open chakras! That, or I read too much."},
{"title": "Shakespeare in Love, and a Vibrator", "date": "Friday, April 23, 2010", "text": "Day 73 of the \"What are you reading, and why?\" project. It's Shakespeare's birthday! Is anybody reading some Shakespeare to celebrate? I put Shakespeare in Love into the machine last night to celebrate, seeing the opening, her audition, the Queen reminding her to bow as Kent, and the shipwreck, sort of a sleep montage.It's also Vladimir Nabokov's birthday! Is anybody reading Lolita to celebrate? Is anybody Reading Lolita in Tehran?And it's Kingsley Amis's birthday. (Thank you, Garrison Keillor, Writer's Almanac!) Is anybody reading Lucky Jim? I don't think I ever have read that one, an early campus novel (according to Keillor...'s staff). But I bet it's on my parents' bookshelf, if I want to. I say that to help me resist buying any more used books with my employee discount at Babbitt's. The Girl Who Played with Fire, by Stieg Larsson, came into the store yesterday, and, yes, by now you know what happened. And I haven't even read the other one yet! But I figure these will be great books to take on vacation to the beach this summer. And share! But, speaking of campus novels, who has read Straight Man, by Richard Russo? It's hilarious. I gave it to my department chair when I left a teaching job I loved (had to move) and as he was leaving the chairpersonship, a rotating position. (See him twirling?!) Anyhoo...As you can see, this is another of my whimsical, hodge-podge entries, and I will also let you know now that I am going on a 2-day retreat, with women, so I will ask them what they are reading, and will post two entries in one someday on Sunday, instead of one on Saturday. Today's Friday, right?  This is turning into a sort of 2-in-one, too, or 3-in-one, etc.  Anyhoo...!The theme of the women's retreat is passion. Passion as enthusiasm, passion as love (various kinds: romantic, sexual, or strong feeling, compassion, etc.), and passion as suffering (that kind of strong feeling, as in religious passion). Perhaps I will learn about books on passion, or books with passion in the title. Shakespeare in Love had passion, but I was asleep through most of it.Franny and Zooey had passion. Of the various sorts.Also set aside for purchase with employee discount at a future date is The Lost Sisterhood. Not the one by Julia Ingram, about The Return of Mary Magdalene, Mother Mary, and Other Holy Women, which does look like something I'd want to read and will snag if it comes into Babbitt's, but The Lost Sisterhood: Prostitution in America, 1900-1918, by Ruth Rosen. It's about the profession of prostitution, about women who chose and developed that line of work, and about it being rooted out as society's major ill at the time, without, of course, rooting out the cause/need of it, as usual. I look forward to reading that, as I enjoyed Sex in the Second City, by Karen Abbott, focusing on brothels in Chicago, and the businesswomen who ran them, the men who frequented them, and the police who protected and/or raided & closed down their establishments.This is on my mind a bit after a little discussion in the blog of poet Martha Silano about women being able to choose their work and their pleasures, and the complicated history and values attached to this. (Read her book Blue Positive, pictured & available to click at her blog of the same name! After all, it is National Poetry Month!)And, along those lines, where is my copy of The Technology of Orgasm, by Rachel P. Maines, another great Babbitt's find, subtitled \"Hysteria,\" the Vibrator, and Women's Sexual Satisfaction (Johns Hopkins Studies in the History of Technology)? I know I bought it, read it, and did not reshelve it in either Women's Studies or Technology at work, so it's here at home somewhere. Unless I loaned to my mom.  Or dad.Also, I suspect Sarah Ruhl may have read it researching her play In the Next Room, aka The Vibrator Play, and that's what those women are doing in the picture, figuring out what the heck this 19th century medical device is.Sarah Ruhl is one of my favorite playwrights. And that brings us back to Shakespeare!"},
{"title": "Was Salinger an SOB? (RIP)", "date": "Thursday, April 22, 2010", "text": "Day 72 of the \"What are you reading, and why?\" project. Janet, Kim, Pam, Phyllis, Susan, and I just finished reading Franny and Zooey, by J. D. Salinger, and all but one of us met last night to discuss it. At the same time, the SOBs, a self-named men's book group, met to discuss The English Major, by Jim Harrison. No doubt there was griping, moaning, and complaining, mixed with drinking, laughing, distraction, and hilarity at both gatherings.And maybe some discussion of the actual book.In our group, I feared we would go off track when one of us said, \"Salinger was a despicable person,\" but another of us said she got so intrigued again by Salinger that she started to do Internet research and then respected his impulse to withdraw from the public eye and let his work be the focus, not his life. (Maybe he knew someone was bound to say he was a despicable person.)To quote Salinger having Zooey read Marcus Aurelius, as quoted on white beaverboard on the back of his big brothers' bedroom door: \"It loved to happen.\" Sigh...Here are my interpretive questions about Franny and Zooey:Why does Zooey pretend to be Buddy on the phone?(Is it primarily for Franny’s, Bessie’s, or his own sake?)Why is Buddy the actual narrator of “Zooey”? (Doesn’t “Franny” have an invisible narrator?)Why does Zooey treat Bessie, his mother, the way he does?--Why does he tease, mock, insult, etc.?--And why does Bessie not mind, and sometimes not even notice?--Why does Bessie converse with him in the bathroom?Why is it important that both Franny & Zooey are actors?Why is it important that they both had a sort of religious education from their big brothers?Why is it important that Seymour Glass has committed suicide?I have some ideas about and numerous possible answers for these questions, which is why they are interpretive questions. I always like to hear what other readers think, based on the book itself, not stuff about the author's biography. Generally I find there is plenty of exciting truth and paradox in good and great fiction. Curious as I am about authors' lives, I generally leave them to their privacy when interpreting the work. I interpret the work according to the work.Likewise, I don't go read what the critics say. I read the book. Or the poem, or the short story, treatise, essay, etc. What is this particular writer showing me, teaching me? After that, I love to converse with people who have read the actual book, closely and with care. And then I do sometimes read what experts say, scholars or deep readers--yes, some are critics!--who have spent many hours reading the works themselves, and, yes, about the authors' lives. I just don't read received opinion/interpretation before I do my own work. Nor do I substitute biography for interpretation. I work hard when I write a story or poem. I want somebody to read it, not me! I'm in there, just invisible. Trust me.Never mind. And I've decided to pronounce Zooey to rhyme with \"Phooey!\""},

Diane will soon be reading Swimming with a Hundred Year Old Snapping Turtle, poems by Freya Manfred, thanks to me and Garrison Keillor.That is, I discovered Freya Manfred thanks to Garrison Keillor's Writer's Almanac, and Diane discovered her thanks to me reading one of her poems on Poetry Sunday at my church, in our annual celebration of National Poetry Month.Oh! Or shall I say, \"Eau!\" This is not to suggest any badness in reference to Freya, though there is plenty of eau! She is swimming, after all, with a 100-year-old snapping turtle, and she is even swimming, with scuba apparatus, in her author photo in the back of the book, in the edition I have with an About the Author page added in August, 2009, by Red Dragonfly Press of Red Wing, Minnesota. (Have I mentioned I'm a Pisces? Have I mentioned my dream of swimming with dolphins? Have I mentioned my admiration for cephalopods? Including that playful octopus that stole the guy's video camera on my MSN homepage this morning! With song lyrics that include Jacques Cousteau, swimming with dolphins, and \"I love you.\")I love Freya Manfred. I love her with the excruciating tenderness her poems generate in me.As I told the congregation on Poetry Sunday, I feel about Freya the way Joan Didion's daughter felt about Georgia O'Keeffe when she saw the painting of clouds in the Art Insitute in Chicago. She said, \"I need to talk to her.\" But, for now, I will listen to Freya, to her poems.No, really, for now, I would like to discuss bad poetry. I am putting B is for Bad Poetry, by Pamela August Russell, on my Wish List at Amazon, awaiting that next coupon I get when I pay off my credit card bill. (I confess, that's how I got Freya Manfred, but now I will save up and actually buy her other books from Red Dragonfly Press!)And this is the follow-up from yesterday, about Susan being troubled by finding only books by popular male poets, like Billy Collins (Ballistics), or immortal female poets (like Emily Dickinson), on the display endcap at Barnes & Noble during National Poetry Month. And, by the way, I handled one of the early printings of Final Harvest at work yesterday, right before the power went out and I went home, which is Thomas H. Johnson's edition of 575 of her 1775 poems.Which does circle us back round to \"bad poetry.\" That is, all of us poets have to write at least 1775 poems to get 575 good ones, or that's what it feels like, anyway. Surely even the great poets write plenty of bad and mediocre poems on the way to the good and great ones.But what Russell has done is to celebrate the \"bad\" and \"mediocre\" impulse in all of us, humans or poets, in what must be actually very good poems, full of cleverness, craft, and probably downright genius. It takes a really good poet to write bad poetry, the kind that makes the reader cringe at the truth and laugh out loud, and that's what people are saying about B for Bad Poetry. Which is on the endcap at my local Barnes & Noble, for National Poetry Month!And here is a bad poem I have written in honor of it, of her, and of bad poetry everywhere:Today in Barnes & NobleI saw a book of bad poetryon the endcap.I could have been making $$at this all along.I coulda beena contenda!InsteadI Beano fartenda! And now you know the horrible, embarrassing truth about me. (Although I was vaguely hoping you'd stopped reading this entry a little earlier....)"},

This link sends you to a page where you can order it and also click around in the beautiful Black Ocean to read more about the press and find the editor's blog. The book blurb under the cover at the first link tells us Adams is the Chicago editor for Black Ocean.The editor, Janaka Stucky, won Best Poet in Best of Boston's annual poll this year, partly, he explains, because he suggested himself as a write-in candidate, and plenty of people wrote him in! Like Susan herself, who was troubled by the same old, same old set of poets displayed in the big bookstores for National Poetry Month, Janaka was troubled by the list of Boston poets offered in the vote: Frank Bidart, Sam Cornish, Louise Gluck, Margo Lockwood, Robert Pinsky, and Rosanna Warren. I have read some but not all of these, admired much, and The Wild Iris by Louise Gluck is a favorite of mine. Stucky has read and admired the work of some of these poets, too, but it was the principle of the thing for him--not enough variety in the list. (I may return to this poetry-in-display theme tomorrow....) Stucky also edits a magazine called Handsome that sounds intriguing indeed.I am hoping Susan will tell us more about A Useless Window here or in her own blog, Mythology and Milk. I love the title and the cover!Meanwhile, please let me know if you are reading any poetry for National Poetry Month. If so, what and why. If not, why not?"},
{"title": "Local History", "date": "Monday, April 19, 2010", "text": "Day 69 of the \"What are you reading, and why?\" project. A guy from Goodfield is reading The American Years by Harold Sinclair, part of a three-volume fictional history of Bloomington, Illinois.I love asking random people what they are reading! It led me to the discovery, yesterday, of Harold Sinclair, who lived and died mostly in Bloomington. He was born in Chicago and once had a dance band in Florida, but spent most of his life in Bloomington, worked at Sears, wrote fiction and non-fiction, and was fascinated by history, especially the Civil War. The Bloomington Public Library article on him reveals that he judged a short story contest they sponsored in 1950!He died in 1966, around the time I moved to the area. Ah, if only he were buried in Evergreen Cemetery. Then the annual local cemetery walk could bring him back to life, as with Charles \"Old Hoss\" Radbourn! But he's not too far off, in Park Hill Cemetery, if you want to visit him.The American Years, and its companion volumes, The Years of Growth and The Years of Illusion, create a fictional town, Everton, based on Bloomington, and follow it through all those title years. Everton is sort of a contraction of \"Everytown.\"But Sinclair is most famous for his fictional account of the Civil War in The Horse Soldiers, which was made into a film starring John Wayne and William Holden, directed by John Ford.Harold Sinclair also wrote Journey Home, Mrs. Ives of Illinois, Music Out of Dixie, The Port of New Orleans, Westward the Tide, and other works of fiction and non-fiction, including book reviews. Some of these can be found at Babbitt's, but not now the particular copy bought by the guy from Goodfield."},
{"title": "Bullpen Gospels", "date": "Sunday, April 18, 2010", "text": "Day 68 of the \"What are you reading, and why?\" project. It's Sunday, so we have some gospels.That is, Richard is reading Bullpen Gospels by Dirk Hayhurst because it is baseball season! The subtitle is Major League Dreams of a Minor League Veteran, and surely many players have shared these dreams. The book is just out, and is apparently very frank and very funny!And it already has fans and followers because it originated as a blog called The Non-Prospect Diaries, as Dirk was a minor leaguer who didn't feel he had the prospect of becoming a major leaguer. But he did! For the San Diego Padres and the Toronto Blue Jays. (You can learn more about his baseball career on the player page of his website, where, if you are that kind of baseball fan, you can even click on his stats! Or you can click here and float around cyberspace.)And, of course, you will want to see pictures of and learn about the Garfoose.People liked his blog, so it turned into a newspaper column called \"The Bullpen Gospels\" in his hometown paper and others. Dirk Hayhurst seems like a born writer and a baseball player who worked hard to get where he is. What a great story.Reading about him reminded me of what fun I had, and how much I learned about the inside of baseball, reading Ball Four, by Jim Bouton, back in the 1970s. There have been updated editions of that, and a new one is out right now. In fact, Ball Four: The Final Pitch was released on the exact same day as Bullpen Gospels, maybe so people could read and compare breakthrough baseball autobiographies as they welcome in the new season.We have a new minor league team in my town, starting this summer! The Cornbelters!"},

Sigh....Laura is reading Body Surfing because Anita Shreve is one of her favorite writers, strong on storytelling and subtle truths of human behavior. Looks like this one returns to a favorite beach house setting for parts of it, and is more disjointed in the telling, perhaps matching a darker set of human interactions than in some of her novels.I read The Pilot's Wife because many friends had recommended it (and so had Oprah, I learned) and Light on Snow, which I finished in the car, coming back from a winter holiday trip, with light on snow out the window. Perhaps I will read Body Surfing at the beach this summer, when I do plan 1) to try body surfing and 2) to ask random strangers what they are reading!Likewise, Rebecca is reading more Connie Willis, one of her newly discovered favorite authors. Rebecca works at a library and claims that these books keep following her home.I have mentioned that we cannot keep The Catcher in the Rye on the shelf at Babbitt's, but I did snatch up the little red cheap paperback copy that came in the other day, leaving the hardback for some lucky reader. This is a later printing of the same Bantam edition I read in high school. I will read it again soon, after we discuss Franny and Zooey at book group Wednesday night.I was late to work two days in a row, by ten minutes, because I stopped to talk with my neighbor, Dick. Another day, I stopped to talk to him on the way home, when I can linger without being late for anything except making dinner, which I wish could just be carrot sticks, pita triangles, and spicy hummus. But that's another story, with loose shoelaces. And wine.Anyway, Dick was telling me that he was unable to finish a painting he's been working on. He's a retired art professor, finally has time to paint, and can't get this particular painting to work and keeps painting over it. Hey, so did Picasso! To comfort him, I brought up the famous comment about works of writing never being finished, only abandoned. He said he was just reading in a magazine about a guy who only wrote one book and nothing else because nothing after that ever satisfied him. \"He kept writing,\" said Dick, \"but he never sent anything else out to be published. And he just died.\"\"J. D. Salinger?\" I asked.\"Yes, that's the guy.\"I believe I was breaking in my new red high-tops on these recent walks to and from work and these chats with my neighbor. The red high-tops were a big hit last night in the lobby of Heartland Theatre, where I went to see a sweet & funny & charming production of The Trip to Bountiful by Horton Foote, who also recently died.My dad is the sheriff in the production, a good guy! My dad is a retired theatre professor, a great director, and a playwright. Here's a question for you: Are you able to read plays and get a good sense of them on the page?I confess I am usually not able to get everything I need from the page. I get a lot more from seeing a production. This does not hold true with George Bernard Shaw--fabulous \"stage directions\" which are philosophical and/or humorous riffs--and Sarah Ruhl--over all poetic construction & stage directions--two playwrights I do love to read!Soon I will reread Endgame, by Samuel Beckett, and soon also see the Steppenwolf production in Chicago.And now I have untied many more shoelaces than I have tied up, and must now...fall over."},

A bunch of people in northern Illinois...and beyond...are reading the new issue of Willow Review, and I am in it. There, I hope the title of this blog entry and that opening line have sufficiently warned you if you don't want to read all about me. (I am still having Internet access problems, but I will solve them! And do more single-book, or random-entwining-of-books, blog entries soon.)You really can read all about me in Willow Review, as I am the \"Illinois Featured Author\" in this issue, with bio and interview, plus 6 poems, and I am thrilled and honored. I got to read my poems at the release party last night in Grayslake, and hear wonderful poetry and prose by other contributors, and see the support of the college community--deans and other faculty and editors reading the work of absent contributors--and feel the warmth of the poetry class and members of the community who attended.At the front of the issue, in memoriam, are two poems by John Dickson, wise and funny Illinois poet, who was beloved and who advised RHINO Magazine for some years, wrote zillions of poems, and read at many Illinois venues. His book is Lake Michigan Scrolls. (I see that somebody has it for sale for $170 at Amazon Marketplace, so it is hard to find. If you have a copy, hold on to it.)It was great to get to hear Donna Pucciani read, as our paths have crossed in several journals, and I have read lots of her poems. To match a real person to poems on a page is lovely.I got to have dinner with editor Michael Latza, associate editor Larry Starzec, and contributor Susan Kadera. Got to meet and hear lots of contributors, eat cookies, and drink Jo in a Box! Yet another thing out there I didn't know about. Dunkin' Donuts now has coffee in a box.Like wine in a box! And my husband, who knows a lot of things from the Internet, told us at dinner that the original wine-in-a-box guy just died...like John Dickson. Oh, dear.It was great to have Tony come with me, as he had an art exhibit at the gallery at College of Lake County, home of Willow Review, back in 1987. The college has doubled in size and student population since then, but is still lovely. A little lake with an island in it, willow trees, geese.Goose poop. (Which comes with geese.) I was wearing sensible black shoes, I will mention, not the red high-tops, but they avoided the goose poop.The Willow Review cover this time shows \"Humming Dreams,\" by Nikki Renee Anderson, gorgeous, scary, compelling white and red sculptural art from her solo show at Elmhurst Art Museum. You can find her work at her website!"},

Today, due to an Internet connection problem, which somehow miraculously \"fixed itself\" last time, I will be tedious and brief.  (I am rude and unmechanical.)Ed is reading I Told Me So, by Gregg A. Ten Elshof, subtitled Self-Deception and the Christian Life.  He says he is reading it to hone his critical thinking skills, for a course in critical thinking that he teaches at the local community college.  \"I want to know how my students think, or why they don't.\"To this end, he is also reading Teaching With Your Mouth Shut, by Donald L. Finkel, about teaching as leading rather than telling.  Ed says just about everything he reads these days is \"to help me do what I do...better.\"So, in addition to these teaching-specific books that help him do his job better, he is, in the ongoing simultaneous reading habit of many people I have talked to during this project, also reading Wendell Berry and James Herriot books that he has handy at home, and hoping to read The Omnivore's Dilemma by Michael Pollan. He has been waiting for The Omnivore's Dilemma to come into Babbitt's, but it doesn't.  So he located it at the local cancer center, which has an excellent library of nutrition books, including all of Michael Pollan's recent books on food.Where have I put my copy of The Botany of Desire?  (And I have not forgotten that I promised to tell you about the spate of books I read with \"desire\" in the title...during a period of my life that was, well, tedious and brief.)"},
{"title": "When I'm 64: A Study in Red High-Tops", "date": "Wednesday, April 14, 2010", "text": "Day 64 of the \"What are you reading, and why?\" project. Today I am tying up some loose ends, because if I don't, I might forget, trip over them, and fall over.Tony is still reading In Cold Blood and is not very far into the book as life keeps him pretty busy. He is in fact on page 19, if we are to respect the evidence of the bookmark, a former grocery list.The loose end I am tying up here is that, yes, he is reading it because he recently viewed the film Capote, not the film In Cold Blood, which he has never seen. I fear that Robert Blake, who played murderer Perry Smith in that film, is still a loose end, or a loose cannon. Life has creepy little ironies, in that Blake was tried and acquitted for the murder of his wife, in real life, in still mysterious circumstances, and called \"a miserable human being\" by the district attorney. Blake certainly played Perry Smith as a miserable human being, one inspiring pity as well as revulsion, in In Cold Blood.Speaking of bookmarks, Andrew Hudgins recommends their use in a funny little essay, \"Dummies Book for Dummies,\" in the current issue of River Styx, the 35th anniversary issue. It also has \"killer\" poems in it by Loren Graham, Jennifer Perrine, and Mather Schneider, to list just the first 3 writers. Mather Schneider is my favorite taxi driver/poet ever, and I was in Tucson once, waiting for a van at the airport, half wishing he'd come along and I'd get to meet him, half scared to get into the cab, but that isn't what happened, anyway. Every poem I read by him punches me in the heart.Speaking of Tony, I have acquired his birthday present! It is a signed copy of Outcasts United, about the Fugees soccer team and resettling refugees in a small southern community, by Warren St. John, briefly discussed twice before in this blog, as the Tale for Two Cities in this area, and also being read by several communities across the country in the \"big read\" and \"one book, one city\" programs going on to encourage reading, thinking, and conversation.I got to hear the author speak on Monday night, and my blue ticket won me a door prize! I shouted \"Yay!\" (much to the author's delight) as I had returned my copy to the library but really, really wanted Tony to read it, as he is both a coach and a refugee! (Don't worry. Tony, though my husband, does not read my blog, not even, I trust, if I post it at Facebook, so his birthday present is still a surprise! It is hidden in my closet. I am telling you where I have put it, so you can tell me when I forget this little loose end....)Now to the high-tops. My daughter has outgrown her everyday shoes (retired volleyball shoes, as she has a new pair of those, only for the gym floor), and needed some new ones: Converse All Stars, gray. I needed some new ones, too, as I walk a lot, and had worn holes through the soles of all my tennis shoes. She was horrified that I might choose the same style and color as hers, so I said, \"What about red high-tops?\" which I have always wanted.There was eye-rolling and dismay. I was viewed lovingly as a miserable human being.But now I have some."},
{"title": "I Love Myself", "date": "Tuesday, April 13, 2010", "text": "Day 63 of the \"What are you reading, and why?\" project. Jerry, who used to run a baseball card shop down the street from the vintage bookstore where I work, is reading Zora Neale Hurston, because he saw a television documentary on her.He probably knows all about Charles \"Old Hoss\" Radbourn (featured in a previous entry), pitcher for the Providence (RI) Grays, and his fabulous 59 (or 60)-win season, who is buried here in town. Or maybe not. Maybe Jerry's had enough of professional baseball. Maybe now he is always reading literature by women.After all, he came in the door looking for poetry by Louise Erdrich. We didn't have any at the moment. And we'd sold all her fiction when she came to town recently. \"She came to town?\" said Jerry, mingled excitement and loss in his voice. She came in a university library reading series.I scanned the Select New Arrivals shelf, in case anybody had recently brought something back after stocking up for her visit, and the boss took Jerry down the fiction aisle, just in case we had anything left. Jerry then browsed on his happy own, coming back with 2 books by Hurston.\"I grew up in Georgia,\" he said, and told us about the program he'd seen and Hurston's upbringing in Florida. It reminded me of an essay in a college reader my students had read and discussed, preparatory to their own essays on neighborhood, culture, identity, sense of self, sense of self in contrast to others: \"How it Feels to Be Colored Me.\" Hurston lived in all-black Eatonville, Florida, before she went off to school in Jacksonville, where \"I was not Zora of Orange County any more. I was now a little colored girl.\" I grew up in Gainesville. Hearing Jerry talk about Zora made Spanish moss hang down greenish gray from the trees of memory.Hurston died poor and neglected, after work as an anthropologist and folklorist, as well as a writer and actress, but out of sync with her friends and fellow writers in the Harlem Renaissance. Then Alice Walker revived interest in her with an essay in Ms Magazine and the book I Love Myself When I am Laughing...and Then Again When I am Looking Mean and Impressive. (I love the whole long title!)I wanted to ask Jerry if he'd read Marjorie Rawlings of Cross Creek and The Yearling. Another time..."},
{"title": "Scarlet Threads", "date": "Monday, April 12, 2010", "text": "Day 62 of the \"What are you reading, and why?\" project.Emily is reading The Bell Jar because Sylvia Plath never goes out of style.  Countless young women come into the store asking for her poetry, and we seldom have it, because it goes back out as soon as it comes in.  Oddly, yesterday we had two copies of The Bell Jar, one a sturdy hardback, and one a pretty new paperback in the window.  Emily bought the sturdy hardback.  Julia, my co-worker who completed the transaction at the cash register, then asked me about the book.  She is a young woman who has not read it.  \"Is it good?\" she asked.\"Yes,\" I said, searching for the words to describe it.  \"It is compelling and excruciating,\" I said, and she winced at \"excruciating,\" intuiting something.  It is a novel, but an autobiographical one, so I had read it, even as a young woman, aware that much of it was wrenched from the author's own life, and sensing that the author wanted both to hide and to reveal her own suffering.  I had forgotten that Plath first published it under a pseudonym.I spoke then of A. Alvarez, The Savage God, a study of suicide, which I had sought out after reading The Bell Jar and Plath's poetry.  I spoke briefly to Julia of theories that Plath's suicide, set up as it was, may have been another cry-for-help attempt, not the yearning for this utter conclusion. It is delicate to discuss these things with a young woman.  I want to stress Plath's passion for life as well as death, I want to steer any impressionable young woman away from an obsession with death.  Julia was troubled that Plath ended her life with her children in the house, and that is troubling, but I can't help but think she did not want to abandon her children.  She wanted something else, and she didn't know how to get it.In college classrooms over the years, I saw young women drawn again and again to Plath when they picked poems to pursue in papers.  They want something, too, these women, or to escape something, perhaps. There is undeniable power in Plath's poems, for them to speak so intimately and so enduringly.I have The Collected Poems, in paperback, and my mother gave me for Christmas, 2004, the year it came out, Ariel, The Restored Edition: A Facsimile of Plath's Manuscript, Reinstating Her Original Selection and Arrangement, with a foreword by Frieda Hughes, the poet's daughter.  My mother's gift inscription is wise: \"For some insight into someone else's process.\"  She knows, in this case, to stress the art, not the life.Julia knew something I didn't know, or knew and had forgotten, or blocked--that Plath's son Nicholas committed suicide last year.  Like his mother, he had struggled with depression.I had also blocked another fact, or scarlet thread--that Assia Wevill, the woman Ted Hughes left Sylvia for, had killed herself in the same way Sylvia had (head in the gas oven), but also taking their 4-year-old daughter with her.  Maybe this was just too much for me to bear, maybe I rejected the gossip/legend aspects of the troubled lives of these people, maybe I thought that to know too much was to invade their privacy.I remember gossip in the reaction to Birthday Letters, the poems of Ted Hughes that finally handled his reactions to his life with and the loss of Sylvia Plath.  I have read some of those poems.  I have read excerpts from letters in which Hughes spoke of the relief in publishing these, in which he reminded his son that love is the key, and to hold back love is a prison.  All I can feel is sympathy, no blame, for all these people.  Their lives were tied up in terrible knots.What I have by Ted Hughes is Tales from Ovid, his renderings of Ovid's Metamorphoses, those great myths of transformation.  And a myth is a way of speaking a truth."},
{"title": "Daily Reading, Daily Practice", "date": "Sunday, April 11, 2010", "text": "Day 61 of the \"What are you reading, and why?\" project.Several people I know are reading scripture, because it is Sunday.  One poet friend regularly posts of bit of her daily scripture reading at Facebook.  Her scripture is the Bible, generally the New Testament.Another friend today posted her Zen reading for the day.Yet another, a Catholic poet friend, reads from a book of daily meditations--daily--and truly reflects upon it at breakfast with her husband.  It has become a kind of daily practice of their religion that also honors their marriage.I have before me a sweet book called Daily Meditations for Busy Dads, by Patrick T. Reardon.  That is the spine title, and the cover and title page specify Daily Meditations (with Scripture) for Busy Dads, as some meditation books do not provide scripture, just the thoughts of the writer.  Reardon's book has family vignettes, followed by a bit of pertinent scripture at the bottom of the page.  I also have Daily Meditations (with Scripture) for Busy Moms, by Patricia Robertson.  They are published by ACTA Publications in Chicago, and I acquired them when I wrote a little column on neighborhood news for the Lerner papers there.  Patrick T. Reardon was a reporter and columnist for the Chicago Tribune, and lived in my neighborhood, so he was \"neighborhood news\" for the Lerner paper as well as big news.  Last year he wrote the Burnham Blog in celebration of the Burnham Plan Centennial in Chicago.Another writer, Larry Heinemann, of Paco's Story and Cooler by the Lake, also lived in our neighborhood, and I remember chatting with him while we all painted an underpass with our children in a lovely beautification project involving Chicago's \"city in a garden\" slogan.  It's still there, I think, or was the last time I visited, chipped and fading, but cheerful and sweet.  I am especially fond of it because at the center of it was my son's design, carrots and other vegetables and flowers radiating out kaleidoscopically, surrounded then by other greenery and our hand prints in many colors.On Friday, an old friend came to town, the town we both grew up in, and the one I have returned to, and we went walking and talking.  He had forgotten that he once took me to a Transcendental Meditation event, or I am mistaken in my own memory, but he had also forgotten I lived in his apartment in Chicago for the month of September 1981, in a spare room vacated by pianist who had just gone on tour with Mel Torme, while I was waiting for my own place.   Lots of Chicago leases start on October 1.  And that is the way daily meditations, or daily writing practice, like this book blog, can spiral wildly in time and topic.Because it is National Poetry Month, many poets are writing a poem a day in celebration.  I am one of them.  Some of the poems are very, very bad, but some will survive.  I'll let them sit, look again, revise, and send them out.  It's a kind of daily practice.Sometimes I do it instead of church, in my own back yard, like Emily Dickinson:In the name of the Bee--And of the Butterfly--And of the Breeze--Amen!"},
{"title": "A Study in Cozy", "date": "Saturday, April 10, 2010", "text": "Day 60 of the \"What are you reading, and why?\" project.Jo is still reading mystery after mystery, and I have just been re-reading the opening chapter of Reasonable Doubt, by Steve Vogel, a true crime book.Today I want to share with you Jo's categorization system for mystery, and also ponder that \"scarlet thread\" as it winds through real life.Jo says there are two main kinds of mystery: cozy and not cozy.  Within these are a number of subcategories and degrees.  A cozy murder mystery is often set in a small town or other non-metropolitan setting.  The reader will not be exposed to a lot of blood and gore, and good will prevail in the end.  That is, the murderer will be found out, caught, and punished or sent off into the legal system, or meet his/her own bad end.A subcategory of cozy is fluffy, where the detective or investigator is often unconventional, maybe even more of a busybody than a professional.  Fluffy mysteries are cute and often come in series.  There can be lots of sidetracking and silliness, but justice will prevail in a happy ending.My parents were listening to another in the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency series by Alexander McCall Smith in the car on our recent road trip to Ohio.  A delightful, cozy mystery.  I got interested in the people.Not cozy mysteries are gritty, often set in big cities, and don't shy away from tough language and the hard realities of life.  In a gritty mystery, the reader may well see the murder take place, in all its blood and gore, in present action, or in imagined re-enactment during the autopsy or a court proceeding flashback.  The violence may be gross and extreme.A subcategory of either cozy or gritty mysteries is the police procedural, where we learn what happened during the investigation, which has its own intrigues.Those Swedish mysteries by Stieg Larsson sound pretty gritty to me.  But I haven't cracked open my Girl With the Dragon Tattoo yet.  Eww.Reasonable Doubt, by Steve Vogel, opens as a police procedural.  We discover the bodies with police officer Mike Hibbens.  And we see lots of blood, eventually, when flashlights give way to room illumination, and a horrific scene of a mother and children murdered in their home.  The horror is in the idea.  Vogel spares us what he can, and does not manipulate or exaggerate.  He wasn't there; he is re-enacting the scene from the point of view of Hibbens and is giving us the realizations as they come.  But the axe and the butcher knife are right there in the middle of the bed.This is a true crime story, by a radio news director who was troubled by discrepancies in the case.  David Hendricks, a traveling salesman, was accused and convicted of the crime of killing his family.  He sold prosthetic limbs, designed & sold a medical back-brace, perhaps dallied with the models for his catalogues, and belonged to an evangelical Christian sect, so there was an icky factor as the police investigation and trial progressed.  Icky after the horrible fact of the deaths.An important book, raising, well, reasonable doubts, Vogel's own investigation as a writer caused the case to be re-opened, and Hendricks was retried and got out of jail.  What really happened remains a mystery, and telling you the readily available reported facts of the case is not really a spoiler for this book.  It grips you and makes you want the real killer, whoever it is, to be found out, caught, and punished.  Especially, in my case, because it happened in my small, cozy town."},
{"title": "A Study in Scarlet", "date": "Friday, April 9, 2010", "text": "Day 59 of the “What are you reading, and why?” project.Tim is reading volume one of a paperback edition of the Sherlock Holmes stories by Arthur Conan Doyle. He is reading the stories because he liked the new (2009) Sherlock Holmes film with Robert Downey, Jr. and Jude Law, directed by Guy Ritchie. (This, I hear, is the edgy, cynical, martial arts version of Sherlock Holmes, and great fun.)Tim read “The Hound of the Baskervilles” in high school and didn’t like it so much. At that age, he preferred Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg. But he is loving reading the Conan Doyle stories now, starting at the beginning with A Study in Scarlet, which first appeared in Beeton’s Christmas Annual, a popular magazine, in 1887. Not too many copies of this very, very valuable issue remain. (Hmm, a mystery plot has popped into my head, involving the theft and attempted sale of one of the remaining copies!)Tim was surprised to recall that we meet Holmes through Dr. Watson, who has been in Afghanistan during the British military occupation and returns “thin as a lath and brown as a nut.” What a coincidence, said Tim, to find Afghanistan in this novel as well as the news, but, indeed, history repeats itself, with variations. (Wait till Tim gets to the part about Mormons in Utah; that may seem surreal.)Like Charles Dickens, Arthur Conan Doyle first published in the magazines. Some of the Sherlock Holmes stories are truly short stories, and some are full novels, published serially. “The Hound of the Baskervilles” was first published in The Strand Magazine, August, 1901 through April, 1902. The Strand went out of publication in 1950—the usual budgetary woes—but, delightfully, as of 1998, is back! How many of you mystery fans read it?I’m struck by a sentence from A Study in Scarlet, related to its title: “There’s the scarlet thread of murder running through the colourless skein of life, and our duty is to unravel it, and isolate it, and expose every inch of it.”This is intriguing in several ways:A working title for A Study in Scarlet was A Tangled Skein.The skein is “colourless” without the thread of murder, as if life is boring without the threat of its loss at the hands of another, or the thrill of this happening to someone else…which may help account for the avid reading of murder mysteries if not, perhaps, the persistence of murder itself…which seems to have other sources & motives than relief from boredom or the need for a shudder while safe in an armchair.The duty to unravel and expose the scarlet thread was Conan Doyle’s own passion, as he exposed injustice in some real life cases as well as his fictions. This, too--a longing for justice--helps explains why many people prefer murder mysteries, where the killer is usually caught and justice can prevail, to true crime, or the news, where the truth does not always come out, and injustice sometimes goes unpunished. Not all murder mysteries tie up neatly and let goodness prevail...but \"cozy\" ones do. (More on that another time.)I return to “the colourless skein of life” and imagine as well an invisible strand of melancholy in Conan Doyle, saddened by the loss of various loved ones and interested in spiritualism as well as justice and detective fiction.More on true crime, In Cold Blood (previous entry), and categories of murder mystery…to come."},
{"title": "In Cold Blood", "date": "Thursday, April 8, 2010", "text": "Day 58 of the \"What are you reading, and why?\" project. Tony, aged 58, is reading In Cold Blood, by Truman Capote, for the first time.He is reading it because he recently saw the film Capote. (I think that's the film he was referring to--maybe he saw the film In Cold Blood somewhere. I will follow up on this. In Cold Blood was filmed at the site of the murder, and I remember it as chilling indeed.) Since today I have to be off and about early and for much of the day, I will pose a question, write a little here, and get back to you.What I want to know is this: When did you first read In Cold Blood, if you've read it, and did it scare you?And, of course, why did you read it? (And why and how did it scare you?)All the accounts, and the film Capote, inform us that Truman Capote wrote the book because he saw a brief news account of a family murdered in their home in Kansas. Since there was no robbery and no clear motive, the article suggested \"a pychopathic killer,\" a phrase attributed to the sheriff. Capote went to Holcomb, Kansas to learn more about the event, the town, the people there, and, of course, the murderers. The novelist Harper Lee went to Kansas with him and helped him communicate with the townspeople and gather the necessary information.He wrote his famous \"non-fiction novel,\" blending memory, imagination, and \"participant observer\" reporting. He and it became a sensation.I was 10 when the film In Cold Blood came out, so I'm pretty sure I didn't see it then. I think I saw it several years later, on television.But I remember reading the book in my teens when living with my family in a farmhouse out in the country, surrounded by corn and bean fields. I tried not to read it at night, instead taking it out in the yard, in the sunshine, the wind blowing, my dog nearby."},
{"title": "Take Me Out to the Old Hoss Game", "date": "Wednesday, April 7, 2010", "text": "Day 57 of the \"What are you reading, and why?\" project, and baseball season has begun, so a man from out of town, a perfect stranger to me--he has a name, but I don't know it--is reading a stack of baseball books.One of them is Old Hoss, by James W. Bennett, a fictionalized account of the life of baseball legend Charles Radbourn. I always think his name is spelled Radbourne, with an \"e,\" and now I know why! It is spelled that way, on his tombstone and a plaque in Evergreen Cemetery, which is how I know him best. Every year in October, actors stand up and speak as the dead buried in this beautiful cemetery in Bloomington, Illinois, and I got to see and hear Rhys Lovell speak and spit tobacco (stage secret: Tootsie Rolls) as Charles Radbourn.For a more factual account of this undeniably fantastic pitcher, you can read Fifty-Nine in '84: Old Hoss Radbourn, Barehanded Baseball, and the Greatest Season a Pitcher Ever Had by Edward Achorn. The 59 here refers to Radbourn's wins in his thrilling 1884 season pitching for the Providence Grays. The official scorekeeper that day actually credited the win to Radbourn, giving him 60 wins that season, instead of to Joe \"Cyclone\" Miller, the starting pitcher (who pitched 5 innings), but, according to Wikipedia, modern rules would give the win to Miller, leaving the statistic in dispute.As the Achorn subtitle says, Radbourn played in the days of barehanded baseball, when even catchers caught the ball without a glove. Radbourn was called \"Old Hoss\" for his horselike stamina and strength, in pitching almost non-stop in that crucial Grays season after fellow pitcher Charlie Sweeney was first suspended and then kicked off the team for bad behavior (came to practice drunk, refused to leave the mound for a relief pitcher, etc.).In his cemetery performance, Lovell incorporated this bit of Radbourn bragging, here quoted from an article about 19th-century baseball by Eric Miklich, who reminds us that Radbourn was a butcher:\"Once asked if he ever tired of pitching so often, [Radbourn] replied, 'Tired out tossing a little five-ounce baseball for two hours? I used to be a butcher. From four in the morning until eight at night I knocked down steers with a 25-pound sledge. Tired from playing 2-hours a day for 10 times the money I used to get for 16 hours a day?'” When he retired from baseball, Old Hoss Radbourn ran a tavern and billiard room in Bloomington. As bold as he sounds above, he was apparently too shy (or too vain) to come out in public after losing an eye in a hunting accident. He entered the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1939.Edward Achorn, who wrote the 59 in '84 book, and won a Pulitzer as a historian, was an editor for the Providence Journal, in Providence, Rhode Island, home of the Grays. James W. Bennett, who wrote Old Hoss, lived and wrote for a time in Bloomington, where Radbourn died."},
{"title": "Lost and Found in Translation", "date": "Tuesday, April 6, 2010", "text": "Day 56 of the “What are you reading, and why?” project.Two charming and serious young men, and perfect strangers to me, are reading books I helped them find yesterday at Babbitt’s.One was interested in Russian poetry, so we came up with the Collected Poems of Boris Pasternak, the Doctor Zhivago guy.  In fact, one of the books we found was of all the poems included in that novel, but the other book, of course, has everything.We also looked for the poems of Anna Akhmatova, who has a poem called “Boris Pasternak,” but we didn’t have her at the store.  I have a copy of the Poems of Akhmatova, selected, translated, and introduced by Stanley Kunitz with Max Hayward, with facing-page Russian originals.  I don’t read or speak Russian, but there is something nice about seeing the shapes there, the letters, the lines, the stanzas, the resemblances.I also have Jane Kenyon’s Collected Poems, which contains her Akhmatova translations, also published separately as Twenty Poems.  It is fascinating to compare translations, and to mull over the act itself.  I have read Jane Hirshfield’s comments on translation in The Ink Dark Moon and Nine Gates, and heard several theories on it over the years.  Ezra Pound did loose translations of Chinese poets, and Robert Bly also favored the freer style of translation.  “The poet as translator lives with a paradox,” says Stanley Kunitz, a poet and a translator of poetry.  “His work must not read like a translation; conversely, it is not an exercise of the free imagination.”Here is the opening paragraph of Kunitz’s Note on the Translations of the Akhmatova poems:“Pasternak was once rebuked by a pedant who came to his door bearing a long list of the poet’s mistakes in translating Hamlet.  The complaint was greeted with laughter and a shrug: ‘What difference does it make?  Shakespeare and I—we’re both geniuses, aren’t we?’  As if to justify his arrogance, Pasternak’s Hamlet is today considered one of the glories of Russian literature.”The other young man found The Magic Mountain by Thomas Mann on his own (I did not note the translator) but also wanted some Barthes, so I located for him a book of interviews in our general literary criticism section.  We had The Grain of the Voice: Interviews 1962-1980, Roland Barthes, translated by Linda Coverdale.  (It was a darn good deal I see from checking prices, used and new, at Amazon Marketplace!)I try not to press charming young men about the reasons for what they do, especially in spring, and especially as a shopgirl old enough to be their mother, but they had that studious look about them that suggested this was important stuff to be reading while studying comparative literature or being an English major in college.  That is a pretty pedestrian exercise of the free imagination (on my part) in our two-university town.  To get a little wilder, I can imagine they are going to write poems between the lines of Pasternak, or re-enact the Barthes interviews in a gallery installation, or read and chain-smoke on the quad while the tulips continue to open up, or that they are both geniuses along the lines of Shakespeare and Pasternak, but that is as far as I am going to go today, this 6th day of National Poetry Month and 56th day of the book blog project, Musings on What We Read and Why."},
{"title": "Sucked into the Vortex", "date": "Monday, April 5, 2010", "text": "Day 55 of the \"What are you reading, and why?\" project.Several of us were traveling over the weekend, and Bob reports that he was sucked into the vortex of a used bookstore:\"The weather in Washington was beautiful on Thursday, so I went for a walk at lunchtime--and was sucked into the vortex of a used book store. My eye was caught by a two-volume biography of Lytton Strachey by Michael Holroyd. Having always been interested in Strachey as a critical writer, and having been intrigued by Emma Thompson's portrayal of Dora Carrington, I picked it up. And, when I saw Gielgud: A Theatrical Life right next to it, I couldn't resist that either. Then, I saw Jack Germond's and Jules Witcover's Blue Smoke & Mirrors--their account of the 1980 presidential campaign, and had to pick it up. (I've long been a fan of both of them, since Jules Witcover's 85 Days: The Last Campaign of Robert Kennedy, and since the first column I read by Jack Germond back in the Washington Star), Seymour Hersch's Dark Side of Camelot and lastly Don DeLillo's Falling Man. I only stopped at six volumes because of how far I had to walk back to the office.\"Because I work in one, I am very familiar with the hazards of being sucked into the vortex of used books, and I wish Bob well with his heavy lifting as well as his heavy reading. I am hoping he reports here again when he has time, as his comments are always enlightening. Anna was reading Falling Man earlier in this blog, and I think my dad would like the Gielgud book, as he was reading one Alec Guinness's memoirs, Blessings in Disguise, this summer, so I borrowed and read it, too. Ah, in fact we traded memoirs, as I recall, so, as I had wished recently, he has already read The Tender Bar! And, yes, my mother had found the Guinness book in the vortex of Babbitt's Books.I will rummage in the vortex to see if we have My Name Escapes Me, another Guinness memoir, built from diary entries, just because I love the title! This seems like one I could dip into on breaks and leave in the store for someone else, which I should, of course, do more often!Ah! And all this reminds me that I will indeed get to pack books for a week-long vacation in Michigan in July. There is no Internet access in the house but there is in a little cafe down the street, so if my son allows it, I will borrow his laptop to keep up with this blog. If not, I will again hand write the entries and post them later, as I did with this little Easter weekend trip.And I loved Susan's comment about asking perfect strangers what they are reading, which I do regularly in the vortex of the bookstore, or sometimes when I follow people outside and talk to them on the sidewalk. (Julie, I am not a stalker.) I promise I will ask perfect strangers on the beach this summer what they are reading, especially if they have actual sandy books visible on the towel or sticking up out of the swim bag. And in the Internet cafe. If I am not too shy.And it's possible that we will get to Virginia sometime this summer, too, Bob! I have an aunt there fixing up a house in Charlottesville, and a handyman artist husband with a volleyball pal in Northern Virginia (a separate country, as I now understand it, the rest of Virginia being a part of The South, which was brought home to me when I handled a Richmond, VA newspaper from the Civil War period listing Jefferson Davis as The President of the United States), and another aunt in Alexandria. If events collide, we might wander the vortex together!"},
{"title": "Scarlet Letters", "date": "Sunday, April 4, 2010", "text": "Days 53 & 54 of the \"What are you reading, and why?\" project. While I was in Ohio this weekend, I did discover what 4 people are reading, some of them family members, one my actual daughter, who has inherited my ability to read in a moving car.Jeff*, who came on a plane from California to the Midwest for perfect 80 degree spring weather (leaving 40 degrees and a cold rain behind him), was reading The Wordy Shipmates by Sarah Vowell and in fact finished it on this trip. He reads widely, likes to read used or borrowed books, and a tiny yellow post-it on the front cover tells him to return these Wordy Shipmates to \"BAD,\" someone's initials, not someone's nickname. So I hope he will! Sarah Vowell mixes humor and historical anecdote on public radio as a contributor to \"This American Life\" and in books like this one, where the topic is the fine distinctions and conflicts between feisty Massachusetts Puritans, as well as other conflicts in the world at large.By coincidence, my niece Maggie has just been reading The Scarlet Letter, by Nathaniel Hawthorne, also about the Puritans, or at least using them in emblematic, fantastic, and romantic ways to tell the story of Hester Prynne and the courage of someone valuing the inner life against the conventions of the community...and eventually revealing her value to the community and to so many readers ever since.(Also by coincidence, I am just now starting a re-reading of The Scarlet Letter--one of the readings for Great Books Chicago in early May--and still reading the essays, one by one, in The Death of Adam, by Marilynne Robinson, an expert on those same Puritans.)Alas, for Maggie's Honors English class, forced to read some truncated version of the American classic! Maggie read the original, purchased on her own, and her class read the \"dumbed down\" version as she referred to it, \"with different words.\" Why is an Honors English class reading a \"dumbed down\" version, I have to ask. It seems an irony, no doubt related to the teaching-to-the-standardized-test conventions of education in our times.Family had gathered in Ohio to see a dance concert, with commissioned new music, choreographed by my brother-in-law, based on a series of my husband's paintings of hands. By continuing coincidence, the theme of the dance was that marvelous tension between individual and community, Hester's lifelong dance. (Though none of the dance creators had been reading The Scarlet Letter!)In the lobby on opening night, I found Mary, mentioned here earlier in a simultaneous reading context, who, like Toni in an earlier blog entry, was reading The Anthologist by Nicholson Baker, in which the main character, unable to write the introduction to a contemporary anthology, rails a bit against the popular poet Billy Collins, whom, again, it seems important to defend, not that he needs me to defend him! His poems certainly speak for themselves and are heard by many.I confess that I don't really understand how the same people who celebrate the breaking of any barriers between \"high culture\" and \"low culture\" are also sometimes the ones who can't abide a poet of the people, a popular and successful poet like Billy Collins or Garrison Keillor. All I can think is they want to be able to use popular culture in their own poems without having to connect to people as Collins, Keillor, or, for that matter, Walt Whitman can. But that might be 1) cynical or 2) not it at all. There is a lot I don't get, and I have never been hip or cool.It's not that every single poem by Billy Collins is a \"great\" one. Not every single poem by Emily Dickinson is a great one, either. Some are surely clunkers. Why wouldn't they be? She wrote a jillion poems, most often without benefit of helpful feedback from readers/poets who could match her in innovation and intelligence. Billy Collins could have helped her! And did, in his poem \"Taking Off Emily Dickinson's Clothes,\" which takes my breath away, and hers. Seek it out in his book Picnic, Lightning, or reprinted in Sailing Alone Around the Room.Come to think of it, my poem \"Making Love to General Robert E. Lee,\" published last year in Poems & Plays, is similar to the Collins poem in bringing people together despite the barrier of history (but I have already mentioned here my nonbelief in linear time!). Because of its unusual subject matter, this is one of those poems I have published but not shared with my daughter, who is reading Honey, Baby, Sweetheart by Deb Caletti, checked out from her school library.While the title is disconcerting, I gather from the flaps that it will have an ultimately wholesome message of female empowerment, independence, and self-realization...and that the heroine will have learned from her experience of her irresponsible father not to get too wrapped up in the \"bad boy\" boyfriend, but we'll see. I think this because the librarian mom drags her daughter to a senior citizen book group, so I think there will be some learning from the wise and some learning to be compassionate mixed in here!The heroine's name is Ruby McQueen, which the flap tells me she thinks of as her \"rodeo cowgirl porn star\" name, also a bit disconcerting, as it means my daughter might be learning (or asking me) what a porn star is, and also a bit comforting, as it might mean I can show her my poem coming out soon in the new issue of Poems & Plays...called \"My Porn Name.\" (Don't ask. But the answer is: one of those quizzes on Facebook.)Happy Egg Hunt, if that's something you do. (If you are Kim, Happy Hummus.)*Jeff, my brother, is the one who first introduced me to Living Downstream by Sandra Steingraber, about toxins in the area in which we grew up, and, before he flew back to California early this morning, and before we drove back beside the possibly toxic cornfields, I was able to alert him to a second edition, with updated science, recently out in paperback and Kindle."},
{"title": "Franny and Zooey", "date": "Friday, April 2, 2010", "text": "Day 52 of the “What are you reading, and why?” project. A full deck of cards.Kim, Susan, Phyllis, Janet, and Pam are reading Franny and Zooey, by J. D. Salinger, for a book group. Generally they read books by women authors with women as main characters, because they are all women and connect to women’s experiences, but sometimes they read books by men with main characters who are women, such as How to be Good by Nick Hornby.They are a group of women who know each other from church, a progressive Christian church that embraces everyone, and a title like How to Be Good is of course appealing to them, even though the book itself was both hilarious and ambiguous on that particular subject, and not any kind of instruction manual.Neither is Franny and Zooey…which I am reading, too, for the above-mentioned book group. And re-reading. I read the Franny part twice in a row at the picnic table in the sun on Wednesday, amazed, almost as if I were praying incessantly.Now that I have finished the Zooey part, I am still amazed. I kept smiling at spots in this book—for instance, the ending. I got so excited while finishing it up at the kitchen table, that I grabbed the nearest bit of paper, an envelope, and the nearest pencil, the stub of a blue one, and began to write odd little notes on it, with page numbers:p. 168—stonemasonp. 167—Emily Dickinson/egop. 170—silent when Pilate…and down from that an arrow pointing to The Master and Margarita, a book in which I hung on the conversations of Jesus and Pontius Pilate in the intertwining novel plot, and wept and smiled at once.My notes continue: Easter/Jesus (I am amazed at the coincidence of when I am reading this particular book, and did anyone know when we picked it that it was so much about Jesus and god-related things? Did anyone remember that? I know I didn’t! I didn’t even remember that Franny and Zooey are actors! But I did want to meet Franny again, as we had encountered her in Eileen Favorite’s book, The Heroines, when she came to stay at a bed and breakfast to think things over a bit.)Desire. The phrase “none of your business.”Yesterday I was complaining a little bit. And I have complained quite a bit in my longish life, stupidly and sometimes perhaps justifiably, except that what anybody else does or doesn’t do, as Zooey bluntly reminds me, is none of my business.Anyhoo…I found this book to be a joy and a comfort. I kept laughing and wincing and almost crying, but in a silent, focused, inward way.I got just as upset as Franny at all the people who tear down other people (literary & academic types) in the Franny part. And Zooey is the same way, judging and tearing down people in his own profession—television acting—and the both of them not able to accept someone who is talented and good but not a genius, and thus maybe not brave enough to attempt to be a genius, even if they are born for that…until, yes, they surrender to this possibility and just, uh, do it, but not in a Nike slogan way…really.I had read Franny and Zooey when younger and completely forgotten it, but it came back with startling clarity. I remembered the patch of sunlight Franny stares at on the table in the restaurant, Zooey’s razor, the girl playing hide and seek with her dog down in the courtyard below.Anyway, I connected with this book and with The Way of the Pilgrim book, and its “sequel,” referenced inside it. And so did David, off in North Carolina, reading this same book for reasons of his own, and in part to honor and grieve Salinger.I will be traveling for a couple days, but I will be asking people what they are reading, and why, writing it down longhand in a notebook, and reporting back to you when I return."},

(Huge issues of privacy, marketing, and cultural values shall be set aside for the moment.)But why does Amazon classify The English Major by Jim Harrison as a mystery/thriller? Is it because it has a stalker in it? Or the word \"stalker\" in the plot summary? Anyhoo.... Dave, one of the SOBs who is reading The English Major for his book group (they call themselves the SOBs--I wouldn't ever call him one!) is also reading 2 other books by Jim Harrison, the ones we had handy at Babbitt's!April is not necessarily the cruelest month. But it is supposed to be 80 degrees here today, and I do remember a blizzard on April 4 here in a past year. Anyhoo... April is also National Poetry Month, and there will be all sorts of poetry events going on, so 1) attend some and 2) read a book of poetry this month, even if you think you don't like it!You can hear me read my very short poem \"Coyote\" on WGLT Poetry Radio today, if you want. You can stream it live today at 10 a.m. or 10 p.m., or hear it as a podcast at WGLT, iTunes, or various other websites that cull radio readings from other sites and gather them for general listeners and special populations.Anyhoo...A reading group down the road in Lincoln, Illinois is just starting up, using as its first selection Uncle Tom's Cabin by Harriet Beecher Stowe. I attempted a conversational mini-interview with the leader of this group, to find out why they were interested in reading this particular book at this particular time...but could not get a word in edgewise. The man preferred to have a long conversation with my boss, right in front of me as I worked, so I quietly typed away, listening for the answer, should it creep into the conversation, which was about business and power, not about books at all. After Uncle Tom's Cabin, his book group will read Mansfield Park and Jane Eyre. Had I been able to engage the fellow in conversation, I might have asked why they were reading classics by women authors.\"Who's that by?\" called the book group leader from the fiction aisle when he went to look for Uncle Tom's Cabin. I let the boss help him.Do I sound bitter? Snarky? Neglected? Petty? Human? Foolish? Anyhoo...Perhaps I will retitle this entry \"Anyhoo.\"And speaking of Jane Austen and Jane Eyre, a nice young woman came in the store last week confusing the two, as I did as a teenager, thinking one was the author of the other, etc. Well, it is hard to keep them straight. So I felt vaguely comforted for embarrassment in the past, and was happy to help her find some Austen and some Bronte! And, speaking of Bronte, there are more then one of them, those writing sisters, and a young woman was pleased to find a nice old hardback copy of Wuthering Heights on Tuesday.And another young woman was delighted to find, in the window, where we had placed it as soon as it came in, Sense and Sensibility and Sea Monsters, one of those wacky intertextual classics & monsters books, this one by Ben H. Winters (and Jane Austen), like Pride and Prejudice and Zombies, by Seth Grahame-Smith (and Jane Austen), or Mansfield Park and Mummies by Vera Nazarian (and Jane Austen). Actually, I see there are two P&P and Zombies books--including Pride and Prejudice and Zombies: Dawn of the Dreadfuls, by Steve Hockensmith--nay, a whole series of these \"Quirk Classics.\"And now Amazon will think I want to buy them.Maybe, when he returns today to have lunch with the boss, I should recommend Mansfield Park and Mummies to the book group leader....And that's enough human April folly for today."},
{"title": "Outcasts United Again", "date": "Wednesday, March 31, 2010", "text": "Day 50 of the \"What are you reading, and why?\" project.First, a short knotted string of coincidences: Sarah Jane reports in a comment that she is reading a collection of essays, edited by Harold Bloom, on Jude the Obscure, the last novel by Thomas Hardy.  After that, and the reception of scandalized critics, he wrote only poetry and drama, much of which I just riffled through when a Library of America edition of his works passed through my hands at Babbitt's Books. Co-worker Jo, a Hardy scholar, and a reader of mysteries, just finished \"a police procedural\" (a term I wasn't aware of till she spoke it, apparently a kind of mystery focused on what the police do to solve it) by Peter Turnbull and is taking up The Man from Beijing, by Henning Mankell, a mystery set in Sweden and Beijing, among other places.And Bill, poetry editor for The Hardy Review, and Jo's former professor, just emailed to have me update my bio to publish with 4 poems in the spring issue.  The poems touch on Hardy themes of tragic accident, erotic love, intense weather, and biography.Jude was a social outcast with thwarted dreams of being a scholar,working as a mason instead.  (I am tempted to mention the tomes of \"secret\" Masonic literature we continue to receive at Babbitt's.  Which reminds me, inevitably, of Peggy Sue Got Married, immediately lifting the mood to silliness.)  And very soon, I will embark on another close reading of The Scarlet Letter, and spend some time Hester the seamstress, another social outcast.But for now, I'll say that I have finished the \"Tale for Two Cities\" selection for my twin cities: Outcasts United: An American Town, a Refugee Team, and One Woman's Quest to Make a Difference, by Warren St. John, and look forward to hearing the author speak on April 12 at the fabulous new hotel and conference center in our little town.   (This hotel will allow more academic conferences to take place here, where we have two universities.)The young soccer players in this book are \"social outcasts\" in America only because they are outwardly different from their neighbors in small-town Georgia, having been cast out from various homelands for various reasons, often experiencing terrible trauma and violence.  But soccer gives them a home and a team and a way to bond with others and, eventually, with the larger community. This is more than a \"feel good\" story, even if the eventual movie might make it into that, and one certainly does not feel good reading about what has happened to these families before they got to Georgia, nor what they often encountered here.  It is a fine and balanced account, resulting from \"immersion\" journalism (like the \"participant observer\" journalism of Truman Capote for In Cold Blood, but producing true non-fiction, not Capote's hybrid novel, which my husband is reading right now.) Having mentioned Rick Bragg and his plagiarism woes earlier in this blog, I was struck by St. John's meticulous and abundant acknowledgements at the back of this paperback edition of the book, and this sentence in particular: \"Times bylines usually carry only one or two names, a convention that hardly does justice to the true tally of people who contribute to each story.\"  St. John's true tally is impressive, and he credits all those who helped with articles on The Fugees soccer team published in the New York Times as well as all those who helped with the book emerging from his immersion reporting.\"Reporters, it might be said, scour for facts in the hope of uncovering truths, and while the former may make the page, the latter take root in the mind and heart.\"  St. John then deeply and sweetly thanks the players and families who have clearly taken root in his mind and heart.  I was also thinking here of how his objective reporting of the facts allowed me uncover possible truths between the lines, and also to accept a number of complexities and ambiguities that simply can't be easily reported or resolved.  They exist."},
{"title": "Projectile Synchronicity", "date": "Tuesday, March 30, 2010", "text": "Day 49 of the \"What are you reading, and why?\" project. Paulette is reading Break of Day by Colette, and it is just now, as I compose, the break of day.  There was a full moon last night, and life is beautiful.A young man on spring break, soon to graduate with a wildlife biologist degree and a poetry habit, is now reading Charles Olson, who believed that poetry was a \"high energy construct,\" poets taking energy from various sources and projecting it onto the page via thought, breath, heart, words....\"projective verse.\"(My hidden stand-up self cannot help but imagine projectile versifying.) (That's why it's a hidden self.)But now I must confess to some 1) impulse buying based on 2) synchronicity.  Susan commented here earlier on synchronicity, cool coincidences, Carl Jung.I was reading Midwest Eclogue by David Baker (see earlier entry), the poem \"Melancholy Man,\" and the note on it at the back of the book referring to Anatomy of Melancholy by Robert Burton.  Having written recently on melancholy, I was struck by that coincidence and then further stricken by the desire to read the Burton book.  Fortunately 1) I was home and thus nowhere near a bookstore and 2) when I accessed the Babbitt's search page, we didn't have it.But I came into work yesterday, to do my lovely how-the-heck-am-I-going-to-make-a-living-as-a-poet job of typing books into the store database, and there it was, newly discarded by a library, The Anatomy of Melancholy by Robert Burton, in the All-English translation (no more Latin) edited by Floyd Dell and Paul Jordan-Smith.   You know what happened next.One of my jobs during how-the-heck-am-I-going-to-make-a-living-as-an-actress stage of my life was to work in Special Collections at the Newberry Library in Chicago.  They have a fabulous Floyd Dell collection, so I learned a lot about him there.  That's when I realized Edna St. Vincent Millay had also worked as an actress in Chicago, before heading off to Greenwich Village.  And, yes, behind me on the bookshelf is the huge biography of Millay, Savage Beauty, by Nancy Milford, Christmas gift from my mom and dad back in 2001, deeply enjoyed.  My mother introduced me to \"Renascence,\" Millay's long passionate poem about coming back to life, as a verse reader on the high school speech team, and I've been in love with her ever since.  Likewise, Emily Dickinson.  Their fat biographies sit side by side, in fact, a fine coincidence in my random organizational system based on love."},
{"title": "Stone Soup", "date": "Monday, March 29, 2010", "text": "Day 48 of the \"What are you reading, and why?\" project. This will be another hodgepodge, random potluck of what people are reading.  Michelle is reading John Grisham.  Judy is reading Inklings by Jeffrey Koterba, a memoir by a cartoonist with Tourette's, about his challenges with that and with his father, compared (by Amazon) to The Tender Bar, by J. R. Moehringer, a memoir about a boy sort of raised by a \"bar\" of kind, drinking men.  I would like my father, who had a similarly challenging father, to read that one.Kevin said he was reading The Amazing Life of Oscar Wao, but I have a feeling is really reading The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao by Junot Diaz, a novel about a scifi/fantasy nerd from the Dominican Republic.  That boils it down rather too much, around a sinking stone, so to speak (of soup), as the novel sounds very funny, poignant, and probably oddly informative as well, spelling out the significance of the fuku curse on people who tangled with dictator Rafael Trujillo.In fact, descriptions of the style of this book remind me of the mixed hilarity & poignancy of Everything is Illuminated by Jonathan Safran Foer, not to mention some other \"dick lit\" guys.Which leads me to Zachary Mason and The Lost Books of the Odyssey, a novel that is \"intertextual\" with Homer's Odyssey, without requiring that you know the epic to appreciate the novel (just as you don't have to have read all the Gospels or the entire New Testament plus some Buddhism to appreciate Lamb by Christopher Moore).  I'm not calling this dick lit; I'm just noting that some might, based on the incorporation of humor, a male main character, and one (female) reader's reference to Odysseus as a \"real man\" (in the way Jesus was in Moore's novel) with flaws.  Another reader compares Diaz to both Neil Gaiman and Jorge Luis Borges, which prepares us for a real treat--good storytelling and metafictional labyrinthrian twists and turns.Bob is reading The Lost Books (now or soon), so perhaps he will tell us more about it.  He was, at last report, just finishing up The Diviners, by Rick Moody, which more than one reader compares to The Corrections by Jonathan Franzen as being a novel with edgy humor and the oomph of social criticism.  In The Diviners, Hollywood takes the criticism.Which makes one long for simpler pleasures, sweeter entertainments.  Fortunately, Beth is reading Spread a Little Happiness: The First 100 Years of the British Musical, by Sheridan Morley, the son of comic actor Robert Morley.And that's enough for this pot of stone soup."},
{"title": "Tesla, Pigeons, Slice...of Houdini Pie", "date": "Sunday, March 28, 2010", "text": "Day 47 of the \"What are you reading, and why?\" project.  Paul is reading The Invention of Everything Else, by Samantha Hunt, who talks about her book in an interview in Slice Magazine.It's historical fiction about Nikola Tesla, an eccentric Serbian inventor famous for his work with electromagnetism and the alternating current. Even though some people consider Tesla to be a prime example of the \"mad scientist,\" Wikipedia reminds us that Thomas Edison wished he himself had recognized the true value of the alternating current.But wasn't there a film about what can go terribly wrong with the alternating current? Yes, the film is The Prestige. But, whoa, thank you again, Wikipedia! There is a whole article there, separate from the biographical and scientific info on Tesla, reminding us about his importance in popular culture, from Superman comics to Disney to video games.Not to mention how the alternating current can be used, or imagined, as a death ray!Tesla was celibate and loved pigeons. (I've linked you to the paperback at Amazon, but Slice shows pigeon cover.)Paul Auster in Moon Palace and Thomas Pynchon in Against the Day also used Tesla as a character in novels. And Lynn Pattison has a book of poems called Tesla's Daughter. (Although--see celibacy above--this is an imagined, figurative daughter.) (Just as I am Emily Dickinson's great-great-great-great-granddaughter.)Paul Michel, the reader above, has his own novel coming out soon, mentioned here earlier but now available for pre-order at Amazon, ready to ship around April 10, and available at the AWP Conference, which Paul will be attending. It's Houdini Pie, and is about buried treasure, among other things!And I just read Paul's sweet story \"Not the King of Prussia\" in the current issue of Glimmer Train."},
{"title": "Mystery Meat, Fisher, Bones", "date": "Saturday, March 27, 2010", "text": "Day 46 of the \"What are you reading, and why?\" project.The books arrived from Sweden! I refer to the 3 very-popular-now-in-English mysteries by Stieg Larsson, mentioned in earlier blog entries, including The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.They came in a green padded envelope from Lund with cool Swedish stamps on them from a friend of mine (though we've never met in person) who is a cook, and the books are in Swedish. I have delivered them to another friend (definitely in person), whose husband is of Swedish descent and who can actually read Swedish, and who just had 2 Swedish houseguests who came into the store and found one of those big Swedish-language books published in Chicago for the early immigrant population there.My Swedish cook friend got these paperback editions in a used bookstore walking distance from her house (or biking distance, as everyone rides bikes there--I've seen videos of her town on Youtube!), and she also sent me a tour book, in English, on Lund, trying to get me to visit, I'm sure. I gave the cool Swedish stamps to my stamp-collector boss.We sent Anna-Lisa (the Swedish cook) 2 books from Babbitt's and 2 books from the annual library sale, 3 of them related to food and cooking. While she didn't want fiction, I did send her what looked like a charming book, with some \"mystery meat\" in it, in a plastic bag in the freezer, by Bill Richardson, Bachelors Brothers' Bed & Breakfast, which had poems & recipes & book comments all tossed in saladwise to journal entries. I have stayed in some B&Bs and vacation homes where you get to sign a guestbook, at length if you want, telling about your experience there. Sweet idea for a book.The other two food-related books were by or about M.F. K. Fisher, fabulous essayist and foodwriter! We sent As They Were, essays that capture travel, history, personal experience, and food, and the link at Fisher's name also sends you to other books at Amazon, and we have Fisher books still at Babbitt's. My cook friend will also receive M.F.K. Fisher and Me: A Memoir of Food and Friendship by Jeanette Ferrary. It looks like some readers question the motives of the writer in befriending Fisher late in life, and others see this as a tender rendering of a feisty honest woman who might sometimes be as annoying as that masterful guy on Hell's Kitchen and Kitchen Nightmares, but Anna-Lisa tells me that, as infuriated as he gets and as infuriating as he can be, he knows what he is talking about when it comes to kitchens and food.I do not. If I ever write a cookbook, it will be about the various ways to burn things, or melt the outside of the microwave. But I do like to eat, and I am getting pretty good with vegetables.Meanwhile, my friend with the Swedish husband, Julie, is reading 3 mysteries somehow related to books and bookstores, in preparation for writing some mysteries of her own!And, to top it all off, Anna-Lisa's uncle plays the creepy psychiatrist in the Swedish film versions of the Larsson books!Bon appetit!

{"title": "Hybrid Vine", "date": "Friday, March 26, 2010", "text": "Day 45 of the \"What are you reading, and why?\" project.People keep telling me what they are reading in various places, and I keep trying to gather the slips of paper (literal and floating-in-my-brain slips) in one place, here, on this hybrid, ever-growing vine of a book blog.On the street outside Babbitt's on Tuesday, a fellow told me he was reading The Devils by Fyodor Dostoyevsky (aka The Possessed) and the stack he'd just bought included Letters from the Earth by Mark Twain, which a fellow had come in looking for (and found--we had 2 copies, shelved in different places, like the slips in my brain and in my giant purse....) the previous week. Why are people reading Letters from the Earth this March?! (It's a miscellany, like this blog entry and the hybrid vine in the picture!)Street guy is the one who looked for but couldn't find Habit of Being, the letters of Flannery O'Connor, whose phrase \"a habit of being\" helped me understand myself and why I write, and whose birthday was yesterday!In my inbox at Facebook, Tim told me he is reading Black Sabbatical, by Brett Eugene Ralph, a book of poems, in preparation for writing a review of it. Tim himself is the author of Fault Lines, a book of poems from Backwaters Press, which also published Even Now, by Susanna Lang, who is up next, with Virginia Bell, in the RHINO Reads poetry series at Brothers K coffeeshop in Evanston, Illinois. And Tim has written a book about Jack Kerouac, whose book On the Road we cannot keep in Babbitt's for more than half a day, as it walks right on out the door again.Joy, who reported this at an online writing workshop, is reading Shadow Tag by Louise Erdrich and The Humbling by Philip Roth (whom some of you will remember from the \"dick lit\" entries.) Joe is reading Rama II by Arthur C. Clarke, and Rebecca is reading Blackout by Connie Willis, both readers alerting me of this in Facebook comments. Likewise, Carolyn commented that she is reading The Year of the Flood, by Margaret Atwood. Bringing all these titles together on a hybrid vine, like an anthologist of unlikely blooms, I mention that Toni is reading The Anthologist, by Nicholson Baker, and that Lorel created the vine, which you can view in more detail at flickr.Baker's novel is about a poet who cannot write a promised introduction to an anthology of poems, and this, too, will now have to go into my Wish List at Amazon, along with several actual books of poetry, thanks to its plot and main character, a struggling free verse poet, and its discussion, within a fiction, of many other poets. Sigh.... (Or maybe I can find it at Babbitt's!)And, now, before I disappear into the whirling slips of paper in my brain and the duties of the daily routine, I will say that Lizabeth is reading The Lost Girl by D. H. Lawrence and Connie is reading John Amen's book of poems, More of Me Disappears...."},
{"title": "Midwest Eclogue", "date": "Thursday, March 25, 2010", "text": "Day 44 of the \"What are you reading, and why?\" project.I am now reading Midwest Eclogue by David Baker, because I went to hear him read last night and marveled at his poems. An eclogue is a pastoral or bucolic poem or set of poems, and I had encountered the eclogue in poetic tradition in works by Virgil and Spenser, and in music in works by Lizst and Stravinsky, so while the word doesn't come up that often, the form persists.My mother will be reading his newest book, Never-Ending Birds, and then we will trade! The title of this one came from his daughter, Kate, he told us, and we learned other things about this delightful girl, now a young woman, in his poems and patter. What a wonderful reader he is, and what a joy and relief to attend a reading where the poet reads his poems well, reads them as they are written, with thought and restrained emotion, punctuation and line breaks that help convey both natural speech and artful selection and arrangement. These are poems that say something and can be uttered!Baker is a gardener, so I look forward to poems of fine observation of nature and flowers, and other information. Already, in \"Hyper,\" I have learned more about ADHD and, in \"Cardiognosis,\" more about the structure of the heart and the history of knowledge about it. I am doing the thing I do with poetry books--skip around and read individual poems--and then I will go back and read the book straight through as a whole. I will do this in the summer, in the back yard, when I am not reading other things simultaneously, and when various wildflowers and perennials are blooming all around me.The cover of this book attracted me and looked very familiar. Some of us had lingered in the gallery to chat after the reading, and David said the cover came from an illustration he found in The Gardens of Emily Dickinson by Judith Farr. \"I have that book!\" I said. And I have it now in front of me, so I can tell you that the flower and insect painting is by Maria Sibylla Merian, and is from Dissertation in Insect Generations and Metamorphosis in Surinam, a set of hand-colored engravings. David said it appealed to him in presenting, as if from nature, things that could not really happen in nature--different colored blooms on this same plant, and this particular gathering of insects in time. (Are those the caterpillar stages of the butterflies hovering?! For someone who does not believe in linear time anymore, this makes perfect sense to me!)This book, The Gardens of Emily Dickinson, also shows us paintings of flowers by Martin Johnson Heade, who traveled to Brazil to see hummingbirds, and paintings of women and flowers by Winslow Homer, one of my favorites. Of course I had to ask the poet if he'd read A Summer of Hummingbirds by Christopher Benfey, and he hadn't yet, but had the book and would be assigning it as a special project for his students.So here's a guy whose work I want to know better. I had read many individual poems in journals, and the brief teaching essay in the current issue of Spoon River Poetry Review, but I do so look forward to reading all his books. Another little intersection is Jane Hirshfield, whose blurb, \"Beautiful, inventive, learned, musical, and wise\" appears on the front cover of Midwest Eclogue, hovering there like a tiny italicized moth. I have several of her books, too.A few more connections to mention here:Also in the audience was Kathryn, who will have a poetry chapbook, Turtles All the Way Down, coming out from Finishing Line Press sometime soon. She has degrees in biology and English, and pointed out that some plants do have different-colored blooms in nature. I am hoping Lorel will comment on her back yard experiments with art and flowers, and maybe some of you have seen the nature sculptures of Andy Goldsworthy?And maybe Mary will comment on the insects in the painting? And/or Lauren, a poet and a painter of insects, who was reading This Nest, Swift Passerine by Dan Beachy-Quick in an earlier entry here, and was also reading Journal of Jules Renard and The Red Book by Carl Jung when I first asked the \"What are you reading?\" question at Facebook."},
{"title": "Melancholy Baby", "date": "Wednesday, March 24, 2010", "text": "Day 43 of the \"What are you reading, and why?\" project.Today, and since last night, I am feeling a little melancholy.  The spring itself is joyous--the sunshine, temps in the 60s, birds and animals out, dogs barking at the new smells, etc.--but perhaps the shift to the new season, or the energy it takes to shift, creates this other, poignant mood.So I'll tell you that Beth is reading \"Ode on Melancholy\" by John Keats, and two other poems with a strain of melancholy in them, for a poetry discussion tonight.  Her discussion group is also reading T. S. Eliot's \"Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock,\" and that's melancholy with its yellow fog and whispering women, doubts and regrets, mermaids singing.  So is Walt Whitman's \"Facing West from California's Shores,\" even with its \"very pleased and joyous moment,\" as it's about traveling the world and not finding, or quite remembering, what one set out to discover. And melancholy is one of those mixed emotions, isn't it?  The sadness is dominant, but the sweetness is underlying.  I think of Abraham Lincoln's melancholy.  2009 was a big Lincoln year, especially here in Illinois, and I am still halfway through Team of Rivals, which I want to finish 1) before the movie comes out and 2) before I start The Lincolns: Portrait of a Marriage, by the poet Daniel Mark Epstein, whose book Lincoln and Whitman: Parallel Lives in Civil War Washington I very much enjoyed.  I'm also a loyal reader of Epstein's poetry because he's a Kenyon College alum, like me! Some years ago, I had my Lincoln College students read an excerpt from Lincoln's Melancholy: How Depression Challenged a President and Fueled his Greatness by Joshua Wolf Shenk.  I heard Doris Kearns Goodwin speak, and she does like that more open term, melancholy, to describe Lincoln's famous sadness.  She prefers it to the clinical-sounding \"depression.\"  The discussion of the medications of the time in the Shenk book and Atlantic excerpt fascinated my college students, as several of them were also medicated on our more modern drugs; in Lincoln's day getting treated for ailments might add lead poisoning to the list of troubles! Biographies and memoirs are particularly good at exploring strains of sadness in our lives.  Paulette is now reading Hermione Lee's thick biography of Edith Wharton.  I have been reading it, too, slowly, and my bookmark in it is in roughly the same spot as my bookmark in A Tragic Honesty: The Life and Work of Richard Yates, by Blake Bailey--that is, about a quarter of the way through each.  I can report that one summer, reading a number of things at the same time, I made it all the way through Cynthia Griffin Wolff's thick biography of Emily Dickinson.  I think what happens is that I encounter a rough spot in someone else's life...and just can't get past it...but I must, as I am reading to learn how to be human.And Michael and Kay, who sometimes read the same book at the same time, took up Half Broke Horses, a \"true-life novel,\" by Jeanette Walls, after reading her memoir The Glass Castle.Tonight I'll be attending a poetry reading by David Baker, who is poetry editor of The Kenyon Review.  It's poetry, so I imagine I'll encounter a bit of melancholy there...but perhaps in the way that blues music relieves by giving voice to the blues..."},
{"title": "French Hedgehog and American Hodgepodge", "date": "Tuesday, March 23, 2010", "text": "Day 42 of the \"What are you reading, and why?\" project.Karen is reading The Elegance of the Hedgehog, by Muriel Barbery, along with Decoding the Human Body Field by Peter H. Fraser and Harry Massey. Ooh, French fiction with philosophy in it + new ideas in health about how body & mind work together. If I were reading these two at the same time, my brain might explode! The Hedgehog book sounds like something I should read next year, when I am 54, to match the 54-year-old residential concierge narrator. And now you know my age. But my college-student son thinks I look about 34, which is sweet. (I've linked you to a paperback of this, but it also includes the description of an audio version.)Christina was recently reading An American Childhood by Annie Dillard and Bob has no doubt finished by now Barbara Jordan: American Hero, by Mary Beth Rogers. America and change in America are definitely on my mind today, as we watch the unfolding miracle of health care reform. Wooee! Speaking of France, remember when French fries had to be called American fries? And speaking of childhood and American icons, may Holden Caulfield and J. D. Salinger both rest in peace. And speaking of French fries, I want some.My random, partially exploded, curlicued brain does connect something here--the 12-year-old French girl in Hedgehog, one of the narrators via her journal, is compared to Holden Caulfield in wry innocence. My own local book group is reading Franny & Zooey next, and we can never keep copies of that or Catcher in the Rye on the shelf at Babbitt's. If they come into the store, they go immediately onto the Select New Arrivals shelf by the door and soon walk back out. Those, and books by Ayn Rand. Sigh....And speaking of Franny, she is a character in The Heroines, the novel by Eileen Favorite in which heroines from other books come to stay at a bed and breakfast run by Anne-Marie and her 13-year-old daughter Penny. See, things do connect in my hodgepodge brain! Sarah is reading The Heroines because she went to hear the author speak recently at her college. Sarah is also reading Vanity Fair by William Makepeace Thackeray, who has the best middle name ever! And I am definitely linking you to the edition with the sexiest cover, and the one that most resembles Vanity Fair, the magazine, my guilty pleasure.And that's enough of a hodgepodge for today."},
{"title": "Dark Towers", "date": "Monday, March 22, 2010", "text": "Day 41 of the \"What are you reading, and why?\" series. Today I put together two completely different kinds of writers, as one aspect of American literature these days is to have battered on any barrier between \"high\" and \"low\" culture. I know people still do categorize and label--there is \"serious fiction\" or \"literary fiction,\" and there is \"genre fiction,\" and these things are still organized in bookstores in various ways that keep them apart from each other. But college classrooms put things together, study everything, and have \"elevated\" certain kinds of writing that were dismissed before. The \"comic book\" is now the \"graphic novel\"--or \"Graphic Illustration\" in Babbitt's--and people are respecting each other's art in new ways that are less hierarchical than when I was growing up.So I'll tell you that Kim has been reading The Gunslinger, the first in the Dark Tower series by Stephen King, and that Charlie is embarking on Point Omega, the new novel just out in hardcover from Don DeLillo. (Earlier in this blog we heard a bit about Falling Man, a DeLillo novel about the man falling from the dark towers of 9/11..., and the cover pictured here is from Libra, different towers altogether in DeLillo's book about the Kennedy assassination.)A guy who runs a business down the street came in for another stack of the books he likes to read and was saying the last book in the Dark Tower series was a huge disappointment, and made him feel he had wasted his time reading everything building up to it. But the series was recommended to Kim by Bob, who said the last book made the whole reading adventure worth it, and to definitely start at the beginning! The link above is to a revised edition of The Gunslinger, as King was writing other works simultaneously (the way we read books simultaneously, or the way painters works on numerous paintings simultaneously, etc.) and realized by the end that the beginning needed some adjustment. So Kim might want to figure out which edition she has, and perhaps that's why the guy from down the street was so disappointed. He read the original work, and things didn't add up?!I'm pretty sure the only thing I've read by Stephen King is On Writing, and, to my mind, he was right on about writing.Don DeLillo is a writer I've not yet read. I have read excerpts and essays by him, but not a whole novel. I almost took home White Noise the other day, but instead got The Wishbones by Tom Perotta. I'm pretty sure this is \"dick lit.\""},

I think she also said she was reading Orange Crush (also poetry) by Simone Muench, and if it wasn't Susan, then somebody is reading Orange Crush and thinks it is \"a beautiful, beautiful book.\" And we will watch for Susan's own book about Cyborgs (poetry!) to come out this summer from Mayapple Press.And this brings me to Mike's nice comment about liking the blog because people who say anything about the books here have actually read them! This was in response to the previous entry about book clubs (Great Conversations), where sometimes people haven't actually read the book they have gathered to discuss! I want to make sure Mike and any of you know that often I am simply reporting what other people say about the books they are reading! I could not possibly read this many books in a week or a day!! But I do read a lot, and read books simultaneously, as many of you do, an interesting thing to learn. I connect the simultaneous reading to our generally fragmented and interrupted lifestyles these days, and to the deep cyberspace click and go somewhere knowledge cloud of the Internet and how it is changing the ways we read, think, and gather information. I am alternately worried about what is happening to our thinking (sustained, contemplative thought and the making of certain kinds of logical connections perhaps going by the wayside) and very excited about us using more of our brain folds! We can think in different ways and make new kinds of connections! Maybe we can even recover some intuitive ways of thinking that we've lost!I carry books around with me so I always have something to read, and this is part of my fragmented, simultaneous reading. Between volleyball matches at a tournment, I might be reading a poetry chapbook! Odd place to read poetry, but, on the other hand, the loud music, buzzers, and yelling of warmups makes me focus, and the poems also grab my intense focus. Reading in a peaceful place, like my own back yard, might encourage me to look around at the birds, clover, etc., remember an old boyfriend, and the next thing I know, I am writing my own poem!I finished the book of Letters to a Young Fiction Writer, which had a wonderful thread at the end: a letter from Caroline Gordon to Flannery O'Connor about Wiseblood, a letter from O'Connor to another writer, and so on. I continue to read essay after essay in The Death of Adam by Marilynne Robinson with utter amazement. Now she has a deeply contemplative thought process and style, and I am learning so much from her. One of her complaints--uttered with both patience and subtle peeve--is that historians and literary critics will repeat blanket statements and dismissive cliches about books they have not even read--examples: The New England Primer and The McGuffey Readers--which ties right back in to Mike's comment and concern. Those who dismiss the books without reading them reveal their ignorance...but only to those who actually know something!"},
{"title": "Great Conversations", "date": "Saturday, March 20, 2010", "text": "Day 39 of the \"What are you reading, and why?\" project. And Happy First Day of Spring!Christina has finished Olive Kitteridge and moved on to The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society, a novel by Mary Ann Shaffer, completed by her niece Annie Barrows. The real story of its composition is heartbreaking and heartwarming, as is its fictional plot, but with everything coming out on the cheerful side despite the dark, relentless realities. And it's an epistolary novel, which we don't see many of these days.This book follows on yesterday's entry, in that the paperback carries an endorsement from Elizabeth Gilbert, the Eat, Pray, Love and Committed author. Likewise, coincidentally, a new book by Laura Munsen has appeared in my email this morning, a pre-order announcement from Amazon for a diary-style relationship agony book, leaning toward the cheerful, that promises in its title not to be what we expect: This is Not the Story You Think It Is: A Season of Unlikely Happiness. So if you are in relationship angst, limbo, or are committed to happiness, this might be the book for you.These are all potential \"book club\" books, where people gather after reading and discuss them. Or, in many cases, where people get together and eat & drink and talk about other things. I hear all sorts of book club stories--clubs where the food is the main event, clubs where no one ever actually finishes the book (and a few don't even start it), clubs that meet in friendly bookstores, clubs that meet in bookstores that have cooled off and stopped ordering the books, and clubs that got kicked out of bookstores and moved to coffeeshops.The contemporary \"book club\" appears to have been a marketing event that has and hasn't worked. Editions are published with reader questions at the back. Authors have websites where the questions can continue, or people can become fans, etc. Facebook. So people are buying and reading these books, but 1) the publishing industry is still struggling and 2) if bookstores are kicking book groups out, they seem to be committed to the sales but not the actual conversations.And now, back the the Great Book Foundation, which also publishes editions and anthologies and series with questions included. One of the series is even titled Great Conversations. And there are Great Books discussion groups in libraries and homes all over the place, for people who really do want to talk about the books, essays, stories, or poems they are reading together. But I think these conversations are a little different. Not that they are always about what someone has decided is \"great literature,\" but that there is an actual method of discussion that encourages listening, interpretation, and focus on the text, rather than opinion, personal experience, and general rambling. The newest Great Books anthologies include a lot of contemporary literature, but the \"shared inquiry\" discussion method is the same.So we can find each other out there, people who really want to read and talk to each other about what we read! And/or we can \"talk\" (which includes rambling and opining) here."},
{"title": "Committed", "date": "Friday, March 19, 2010", "text": "Day 38 of the \"What are you reading, and why?\" project. Mary is reading Committed, the new book by Elizabeth Gilbert, who wrote Eat, Pray, Love.I just met Mary recently, over dinner, and learned she brought 3 books with her on vacation--this one, a book on Stoic philosophy, and something called Wolf Hall. She can't remember why she picked up that last one. (Maybe because it won the Man Booker Prize, Mary! It's historical fiction, by Hilary Mantel, about Henry VIII and the behind-the-scenes religious and class conflicts of the times.)And she has Too Much Happiness, the new book of short stories by Alice Munro, waiting on the bedstand for her when she gets home.I'm so glad I met Mary! (Yes, there's something about her!) She reads books simultaneously, as do several of us here. She reads books in hardback! (Though I just realized Too Much Happiness is indeed out in paperback! Making it fair game as book-group material! Yay!)Like me, she gets a little embarrassed when she reads a bestseller \"self help\" or trendy book like Committed or Eat, Pray, Love, but, hey, I loved the latter. It was funny, revealed the author's vulnerabilities, and had great pizza. Plus, it reassured me. My current house number happens to be a really cool number of meditation beads. And Mary keeps an Excel spreadsheet on the books she reads. I hope my local book group will also read Committed: A Skeptic Makes Peace with Marriage. Some of us are married, some of us are not, and some of us are skeptical about the institution of marriage, even if we are in it. And even if we are committed to the ones we love."},
{"title": "Great Books Chicago", "date": "Thursday, March 18, 2010", "text": "Day 37 of the \"What are you reading, and why?\" project. A bunch of people, all over the United States, and some in Canada, are right now reading these 3 works, for Great Books Chicago, an annual spring event in Chicago:1) The Scarlet Letter by Nathaniel Hawthorne (Penguin Classics edition) 2) Endgame by Samuel Beckett (published with Act Without Words 1 in a Grove Press edition)3) Sorrow-Acre by Isak Dinesen (pen name of Karen Blixen, the Out of Africa woman; published within Introduction to Great Books 2, Second Series, by the Great Books Foundation) The people reading these works will gather in Chicago April 30-May 2 to discuss them, \"shared inquiry\" style, and attend various cultural events in the city, including the Steppenwolf production of Endgame, and I will be with them! Leading 2 of the discussions. Yay!!I love this annual gathering in spring. It actually started before I left Chicago, during my last spring of teaching at DePaul, but I was too busy teaching and preparing to move to attend, alas. Instead, I have been able to come back as a discussion leader/participant since 2005 (I think?), having wonderful conversations with lovely people and seeing all kinds of things in the city, including the botanical gardens, theatre and ballet, and special programs at the Art Institute.This year we are going to the Museum of Science and Industry, one of my favorite museums ever! Gadgets! Science! And, as the Great Books Chicago info & registration page reminds us, this museum was the Palace of Fine Arts in the World Colombian Exposition of 1893. That page also reminds us that we can learn more about that world's fair, and the icky murders going on at the same time, in the book The Devil in the White City by Erik Larson, also mentioned earlier in this \"What are you reading?\" project in this blog! Previous years have taken readers on tours of the architecture of Chicago, the city's music, all sorts of wonderful adventures. I look forward to this year's adventure and its theme, \"Difficult Gifts.\" Sigh....When you sign up, the books and all tickets to event are covered by the fee; hotel & food are extra. If you are a reader who loves to talk about books with other book lovers, this is a marvelous spring-in-Chicago (a flowery place!) thing to do!"},
{"title": "A Tale of Two Cities", "date": "Wednesday, March 17, 2010", "text": "Day 36 of the \"What are you reading, and why?\" project.Candace is reading a book about corn.And I think I know why. There is a permanent Agriculture exhibit at the museum where she works, and a new exhibit on food & music in the planning, and the Farmers Market will be coming in the summer, and, eventually, lots of corn. And local poets will read poems about corn and farming and food and folk music at the museum sometime this summer. I will announce it here, no doubt. And I have corn earrings.Late in the summer we have the annual Corn Festival, which used to be in one of our twin cities and is now in the other. A corny transition.......to a Tale for Two Cities, a local event like The Big Read in towns and cities all over the USA, in which people in our particular twin cities read the same book, and the two public libraries offer multiple copies of it and a series of book-related events. This year's mutual read in our two cities is: Outcasts United: An American Town, a Refugee Team, and One Woman's Quest to Make a Difference by Warren St. John. We will meet the author, hear experts speak on a variety of topics, meet some Lost Boys of Sudan, and see the movies Bend It Like Beckham, The Cup, God Grew Tired of Us, Kicking It, and War Dance.Yes, this is a book about soccer! And people! And the world! Ongoing wars and conflicts, the plight of refugees. And small-town America. I started loving it from the introduction, which contrasts the coaching styles of a silent coach who respects her players and lets them play and a \"screamer,\" and I hope my husband will read it, too, as he's a coach and not a screamer.Meanwhile, Chicago is reading Brooklyn by Colm Toibin for the One Book, One Chicago program, and this is something I'll hope to read in the future. I enjoyed his novel The Master, in the style of Henry James. (But whenever I hear \"the Master,\" I think of The Master and Margarita by Mikhail Bulgakov, one of my favorite books ever, but one my mom could not finish....She gets impatient with fantasy, so she was probably annoyed when the Devil came to Moscow.)So now I have mentioned more than two cities: Chicago, Moscow, and our twin cities of Bloomington-Normal (via the library & museum links).And lest Charles Dickens feel neglected for no real reference to A Tale of Two Cities, I will link for him here to Amazon, add an image because I like the lilies of the valley on this particular cover, and remind us that this whole daily book blog thing began with everybody reading Dickens. And, hey, young man came into Babbitt's yesterday in search of Dickens and found some, leaving happy!  And if you too are addicted to books, you will be happy to greet spring at the Normal Public Library book sale this weekend!"},
{"title": "Still Random", "date": "Tuesday, March 16, 2010", "text": "Day 35 of the \"What are you reading, and why?\" project, and if you survived the Ides of March, here we all are again!First, whoa!  Mike Peterson, this is for you!  Did you know there was an opera based on Sophie's Choice, the novel by William Styron and the movie you love?  There was, and there is!  It's by Nicolas Maw, this adaptation into opera, and the film is directed by Trevor Nunn.  And now you can pre-order the DVD at Amazon.Second, Douglas, who was reading The Lovely Bones, is now reading Lucky, the memoir by Alice Sebold, about the real-life violence she experienced.  The damage that is done when we do violence to one another has lasting consequences, as this book demonstrates.  It is awful to contemplate, but if we don't contemplate it, how will we ever stop doing it? This resonates with me daily, and very recently after a kitchen conversation last night with my husband, who was disappointed to learn that violence against women is happening even now in Haiti, during the earthquake aftermath, with girls and women made all the more vulnerable by the disruption and homelessness and nitty gritty realities like outside toilets, etc.  I tried to remind him that it happens during every war...but \"that's war,\" he said, almost excusing it, in the boys-will-be-boys way that gets me and Catharine A. MacKinnon all riled up...and so I did not, at that time, try to remind him that it is also happening daily in our towns, schools, cities, private homes, etc.  We were cooking, and it is dangerous for us all if I get riled up while cooking.  Or have to walk away for any reason.  (Evidence: mildly melted microwave exterior on microwave mounted over stovetop.)  And by setting us in the kitchen and offering parenthetical comedy, I do not mean to trivialize this.  I mean to say it is with us daily.  Daily.  Every single day.For a crash course in the legal complexities of it all, take a look at Sex Equality, a set of case studies.  There are no reader reviews of this at Amazon, because this is for law students.  But it gives you a sense of the relentlessness of it all, and the difficulties of combatting it legally.  So I try to combat it in my own heart, and with well-timed conversations, and even in poetry.  Sigh....  And by standing up to it when I see it.  Woman naked in snow, man beating her with branch.  Offer her help, call the police, and tell him \"No!\"Whew!  So this is when I will say that Douglas is also reading The Violent Bear it Away, by Flannery O'Connor, herself capable of getting riled up and using ironic humor at the same time.  Thank you, Flannery O'Connor.  Douglas is reading this for the umpteenth time because he is writing about the \"holy children\" in Flannery O'Connor.  Not that O'Connor is saying at all the same thing that I am here, or that Catharine MacKinnon is.  I would like to read your chapter, Douglas, on the holy children.And Sonja is reading And the Shofar Blew, by Francine Rivers, about a young minister who has to confront the evil at hand on the way to the kingdom of Heaven, also at hand.  A shofar is a ram's horn that calls us to action.And so this is not so random after all."},
{"title": "Random Post-Pi-Day Fiction & Non-Fiction", "date": "Monday, March 15, 2010", "text": "Day 34 of the \"What are you reading, and why?\" project.Well, yesterday was Pi Day, and I hope you all had some pie.I didn't, but I would have been happy for some hot blueberry pie and a scoop of vanilla ice cream! Which reminds me, I have heard twice recently about the gag reflex in response to blueberries! Who else suffers from this? What a shame! Blueberries are so good, and so good for you!!Speaking of π, Fred is reading The Lost Symbol by Dan Brown, another of the Robert Langdon thrillers involving decoding of symbols, mysteries, and secrets to lead on to new wisdom.And speaking of math, Diana was reading Algebra when I first asked this question! I don't know which book, exactly, and I've got to admire anyone reading algebra for any reason when not in school! (Sigh....I am math-challenged, but I can count M&Ms.)She was also reading Nutrition and You by Joan Salge Blake, which has a yummy-looking sandwich on the cover (I would like a side of blueberries with that!), and Grab a Broom Lord, There's Dust Everywhere by Karon Phillips Goodman, which is widely available online for less than a penny, plus shipping.Carolyn is reading The Progressive Patriot: A Search for Belonging, by Billy Bragg, a politically active musician. It's a response to a very troubling event in his home town, violence erupting in the \"immigrant community\" there, and an inquiry into his own British identity and roots.I have friends who are politically active artists, musicians, actors, writers, etc., and other friends who pooh-pooh politically active artists when they speak up at public events (like the Academy Awards). What a dilemma. If you are very good at something but you also want to do good in the world, or use your own visibility to make a good cause more visible, you are always going to have people telling you to shut up and just act, or shut up and just sing, play the guitar, paint, etc.Of course, we do have the special problem of actors turned politicians here in the United States... I like Glenda Jackson, who seems to have done a good job both at acting and being a politician in Britain, but I don't know much about the latter.Did I mention earlier that Bob Jude was reading Lords of Finance--the Bankers Who Broke the World by Liaquat Ahamed? If so, I didn't say much about it, and won't now. (See above. I will shut up and write poetry.) Anyway, anything any of us can read to better understand economics and economic collapse may indeed be a good idea. I will mention that when I watched The Way We Live Now, mini-series based on the book by Anthony Trollope, I thought, \"Hey, that is the way we live...now,\" alas, caught up in money-making schemes that have little to do with a good product or service, and a lot to do with making money for nothing.And now that I've offended people who make money, study economics, know algebra, hate blueberries or Dan Brown, and are or aren't politically active artists, I will depart for the bookstore...!"},
{"title": "Poetry + Spring Forward", "date": "Sunday, March 14, 2010", "text": "Day 33 of the \"What are you reading, and why?\" project.Lauren, like several other people, was reading more than one book at a time when I first asked this question, and one of them was This Nest, Swift Passerine by Dan Beachy-Quick, which is poetry. I think this is because she is a poet herself, as well as a visual artist.We poets read lots of poetry, or we should, anyway. How else are we going to know 1) what's been written and 2) how it's done!But, like the non-poets out there who also love poetry, I also read it for pleasure, comfort, wisdom, and delight. Poetry, which seems to have few readers during a poet's lifetime, can acquire generations of readers, as soon as we die.But some poets are very popular during their lifetimes. Robert Frost, Edna St. Vincent Millay, Billy Collins.I am reading Ballistics by Billy Collins, former Poet Laureate of the United States, because my dad accidentally bought a second copy of it while buying a book about cars. He needs to replace his Avalon...brake issues...probably with another Avalon...overall customer satisfaction. (It'll all work out.) He loves Billy Collins. He just forgot he already had this book, in hardcover.So I got the paperback, just out this February!Now, if poetry is so memorable as to become immortal, you might ask how my dad had forgotten that he already had Ballistics...and I will just say 1) my dad is sometimes an impulse buyer and that this sometimes involves gigantic flat-screen televisions and 2) people do this with mysteries all the time, and 3) my mom bought the earlier hardcover of Ballistics. She loves Billy Collins, too. Both my parents appreciate a poet who is clear, often funny, and has something to say.So do I. I have all his other books, too, including a first edition, first printing hardcover of The Trouble with Poetry, which I found on the sale table ($4) of Border's still in the first year of its publication, which shows you 1) the fate of poetry during a poet's lifetime, even a popular one, and 2) that not even all poets like him, sometimes dismissing him as glib and lightweight because of his humor, but I always find his humor going deeper than glibness, in a book as a whole, and the humor lightening a heavy truth just long enough to carry it into mind or heart, where it lodges like a bullet the surgeons can't remove.Not like the bullet that passes through the Queen of Hearts on the cover of both the hardcover and softcover Ballistics.I am also reading Stepping Through Moons, by Toni L. Wilkes, and Looking for Montrose Street, by Carol Frith, two poetry chapbooks from Finishing Line Press. I will return to these in a future blog, I'm sure, because now I am reading them too quickly in voracious delight, as the poets are people I've met through print or electronic correspondence and now want to meet through their poems.I can already say that the little boy I've met in Toni's poems \"The Birthday Party-1952\" and \"Coming Down\" just breaks my heart.And what delight to see that Carol Frith is exploring formal poetry in Montrose Street. And I have learned that \"viburnum\" means \"wayfaring tree.\"A poetry chapbook is a slim book, often, these days, saddle-stapled, and, in the case of Finishing Line Press, tied along the spine with ribbon. The history of chapbooks links them with peddlers as they were light enough to carry in a pack or on his person with other objects for sale. They might be compared in length to chapters of a longer book, or to pamphlets carrying current news, treatises, or ephemeral information. The form survives for poetry, and, for example, with journal reprints or museum exhibit catalogs, where a single article often appears between card covers or stapled wrappers.This is the last week to order my new chapbook, Living on the Earth, from Finishing Line Press, in its crucial advance sales period, so here's the link to the New Releases page, where you can find it if you want it. I don't think it will ever appear at Borders on the sale table, due to that saddle stapling, but it will eventually turn up at Amazon, where the link will take you back to Finishing Line. Like a little ribbon looped around the spine.And now it's time to spring forward into your day.... Did you change your clocks?"},
{"title": "Girl, Please!  (A return to chick & dick lit)", "date": "Saturday, March 13, 2010", "text": "Day 32 of the \"What are you reading, and why?\" project.Tom, who was reading Misfortune, the Wesley Stace book about a boy raised as a girl in the 19th century, tried to comment on this blog earlier, sent his thoughts to me another way, and I saved his comments on chick lit and dick lit for later.Later is now:\"Hmmm, here's one gay male perspective. I would have thought Chick Lit would have fallen in the same general category as Chick Flicks, which by my definition are not necessarily by or even about women, but of a certain genre deemed too 'feminine' to appeal to men. My partner and I are always at odds when it comes to films because he tends to like gore and slasher/suspense films (guy flicks), while I am more drawn to more serious, 'thoughty' films, along with romantic comedies and romance in general (chick flicks).\"It tends to be the same with books, he likes true crime and I like books, mostly by women authors (including mysteries by women authors with female detectives), that have a more thoughtful bent to them and are more language oriented. I'd have referred to my taste as more chick lit oriented, but that wouldn't fall under your definition. I hadn't thought of either chick lit or chick flicks as having been necessarily lighter or funnier, but literature that would by a stereotypically male definition, would appeal more to women.\"By the same token, I'd refer to Hemingway and even Stephen King as dick lit because both authors are so prodigiously 'male' in their attitudes that I don't connect to them at all. Which is not to say I'm not male or relate to male authors or subjects, just that I don't relate in any way to that kind of machismo.\"And where do strongly gay male visions like Augusten Burroughs or David Sedaris fall? Chick or dick? Or somewhere in between. This has been a very enlightening discussion. Thanks for sharing. \"I've got to say that Burroughs and Sedaris are very popular on the Selected New Arrivals shelf by the door at Babbitt's, and all the recent buyers have been women!Rupaul offers a way to look at being human in this Woman Made Gallery Call for Art: \"We are all born naked, the rest is just drag.\" Woman Made, as its name will tell you, is a gallery dedicated to exhibiting and promoting work by women artists to help correct a historical imbalance in their representation in the world, but for some theme-based group shows it calls for art from men as well.  This is an all gender call, and defines gender this way:\"Gender is a performance, an act that is perpetuated and maintained by societal norms and expectations, but how, and to what extent does it define us? 'Girl, Please!' seeks to push and transcend the definition of gender while also exploring its relation to individual character amongst collective expectations. Bearing in mind Rupaul's statement, drag in this case is not disco, but rather an illustration of feminity and masculinity in shades of grey.\"If you are an artist interested in this theme and in submitting work to this show, click the Woman Made link above to learn more about how.If you want to return to the chick lit/dick lit dicussion or pursue these other ideas on what we mean by \"gender,\" feel free to comment.Interesting that Tom mentions Hemingway, one of those boys dressed as a girl for a time in childhood, which was fairly common practice, I understand, as one of those 'male' writers."},
{"title": "Synchronicity", "date": "Friday, March 12, 2010", "text": "Day 31 of the \"What are you reading, and why?\" project.When I first asked this question, 31 days ago, Sally was reading a couple of books (and I've learned since asking that lots of people read more than one book at a time, in various spots in the house, etc.), and one of them was Blink by Malcolm Gladwell. Its full title is Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking, and it's about making snap judgements--how we do it, and how that's often better than thinking too much, and how it might be possible to train us to do it better--and about trusting those first impressions & instincts.I've talked to people in law enforcement who say, \"If your first impression is that the guy is scary, stay away, because he probably is\" and so on. The \"blink\" phenomenon may account for \"love at first sight,\" when it all works out, and you don't fool yourself into loving the scary guy by misreading that little frisson.As a poet, my own impulse (& message) is \"Pay attention.\"  If we stay attentive and alert, we do see more.  (What we do with what we see, though, may take a lifetime of reflection...and trial & error, and....never mind.)In sports, etc., acting on first impulses seems similar to \"flow\"--that attentive, \"non-thinking\" energy & resourcefulness that allows us to function at the top of our ability as if by magic.  For more about that, read Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience,\" by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi.So, a few days ago, a fellow came bouncing by on the sidewalk outside the picture window of Babbitt's, and bounced right into the store full of enthusiasm.  \"Can I look at that book in the window?\" he said.  I nodded in a yes-of-course way as he bounced over to the picture-window display shelves to pick up The Tipping Point by Malcolm Gladwell.\"I can't believe this!\" he said.  \"I was just thinking about this.  Everybody's been telling me to read it, and everything in my life at this moment makes me want to read it now.  And here it is!\"So, yes, everything converged for this bouncy fellow, and he tipped into Babbitt's and bought the book."},

It is an Inspector Anders Knutas mystery, and, as it is the third in a series, I have to assume she is reading it because she read the first two!!  And also, as she told me, because she is interested in the location, the research, the history--it's about an archaeological dig.Julie, who discovered she liked A. S. Byatt by reading Possession, is now reading Byatt's The Game, a book about sisters.  She found it at Babbitt's, where we also found some of the books in Byatt's trilogy that begins with The Virgin in the Garden.  Still Life is my favorite in that trilogy, also, at first, about sisters....  The trilogy \"ended\" with Babel Tower...but then resumed with a fourth book, A Whistling Woman, which I mentioned here earlier as I'd passed it on to my dad, who is writing a novel, and he has now passed on to me the novel Ishmael, by Daniel Quinn, which, I take it, is his preferred novel \"model.\"I've heard lots of stories about writers not being able to let go of certain characters, coming back to them in later books.  Likewise, I've heard about readers not being able to let go of certain characters, and demanding that writers bring them back....sometimes back from the dead!Where do you stand on reviving characters for later works?"},

Susan was a bit worried about the author's death, lest he leave her hanging.She is reading the second book now, in hardcover, because she got hooked by the first, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, which she listened to, lounging on the beach on a recent vacation, when she ran out of all her other books.  She was lucky enough to find Clay's Quilt, by Silas House, in a small-town bookstore in South Carolina, so she is ready for tonight's book group discussion of it!I would like now to pause and praise firefighters.  Thank you, firefighters!  Susan and Kim may be laughing at me now, thinking I am praising the muscular male firefighters who appear on calendars, in romantic comedies and sitcoms, and who answered a 911 call a few years back at a women's spirituality retreat, but I refer to all firefighters everywhere, men and women, and to this fine memoir by a volunteer firefighter, Population: 485: Meeting Your Neighbors One Siren at a Time, by Michael Perry.Don't play with fire."},

It's possible, from the descriptions/reviews I read at Amazon, that Jim Harrison writes \"dick lit,\" but I'm hoping we'll drop that line of conversation pretty soon! Just couldn't resist it here.Nor can I resist another mention of Philip K. Dick, thanks to Douglas Robillard's most recent comment (to previous blog entry) about the new Library of America editions of his work, and the fact that he wrote the book on which the movie Bladerunner was based. \"Ohhhhh!\" I said to myself, \"that's right! I'd heard that.\"In fact, one of our recent customers who was buying some Dick, in paperback, was telling me that most of the films based on his work have not been nearly as good as the books themselves. So I will get around to reading him someday.And yes, Doug, I join your wife in recommending that you read the Sparrow and then its sequel, Children of God, by Mary Doria Russell. Powerful stuff that puts human history in context by looking at misunderstandings with devastating consequences on another planet! Our twin cities also read her book Thread of Grace, historical fiction, for our Tale for Two Cities program a couple years ago.So...The English Major seems to be a middle-aged On the Road sort of thing, or exiting middle age, as the main character is 60. And a former English major.Susan and aka Simone have pursued intended audience (and less incendiary labels, like \"women's fiction\" and \"men's fiction\" to help identify book by its intended audience, although the other categories also remain, primarily as marketing tools, as Julie notes) as a guide to reading experience, and The English Major may be intended for a male readership, and an exiting-middle-age male readership at that.But I find I am willing to read just about anything to find out more about the various ways of being human. As my reading impulse is mostly that--not to be entertained, but to learn about being human, and how to handle it--I do find that I learn stuff from just about anything I read.Of course, I have set books aside.... In some cases, I come back to them, as it was just not the right time to read that book. In some cases, I never come back to them."},

SHELDON.  Under the Tiptree pen-name Sheldon wrote some brilliant, award-winning science fiction with a feminist slant. (See \"Houston, Houston Do You Read,\" \"The Women Men Don't See\"; under the pseudonym Raccoon Sheldon, she published the absolutely horrifying short story \"The Screwfly Solution\"; and other noteworthy stories--one of my favorite SF authors). She maintained the pretense of being male until 1976 when she was \"unmasked.\" Her insistence on a male identity created some awkward and poignant situations in her correspondence with Ursula K. LeGuin and Joanna Russ on feminist issues.\"Sheldon had an amazing career before turning to writing. She served in the military during WWII; interrogated Nazi scientists after the war; and worked in the nascent CIA in the 1950s. In the 60s, she completed a Ph.D. in experimental psychology (see her story \"The Psychologist Who Wouldn't Do Awful Things to Rats\") and, almost incidentally, started writing SF when heart problems forced her to abandon her academic career. There is also a dark side to her story: she and her aged husband had a suicide pact, which she carried out when life became unendurable.\"Most of her work, alas, appears to be out of print, though her best stories continue to be reprinted in SF anthologies.The connection between an author's name and writing identity is fascinating, don't you think? The Tiptree nom de plume apparently gave Sheldon license to speak with what she perceived as male authority.\"On the subject of women's bylines:  Consider how Mary F. O'Connor dropped her first name and used her middle name to become Flannery O'Connor. Or how another Georgian, Lula Carson Smith McCullers, combined her middle name and married name to arrive at Carson McCullers. While not strictly 'male,' the names Flannery and Carson are sufficiently ambiguous.\"Thanks to Doug for discussing two fascinating topics here--the science fiction writer herself and the choice of some women to use \"male\" pen names.  There are many examples of this, and I know women writing today who prefer to use their initials rather than announce themselves with a female-sounding first name, saying that it's because they want to be taken seriously.  So the fear of being dismissed simply because one is a woman still exists.I don't think the problems are all solved yet, but it seems to me that anyone with a voice has a place to sing these days, and I am glad of it.Yesterday afternoon a man came into the store looking for particular science fiction authors.  He writes science fiction, general fiction, and poetry under three different names, and only the poetry under his own given name.Discussion?"},
{"title": "Lovely Bones", "date": "Sunday, March 7, 2010", "text": "Day 26 of the \"What are you reading, and why?\" project.Doug is reading The Lovely Bones by Alice Sebold.  (He read it concurrently with another book, which I hope to tell you about tomorrow.)It's not surprising that people are reading The Lovely Bones again, with the movie out, and it went through surges of popularity when it first came out.  That's when my college students told me to read it, so I did, to better understand them and what they found appealing.I didn't realize Sebold had another novel out, The Almost Moon, which one of the Amazon blurbs actually tells people to skip because of its dark subject matter!  So it's OK to write about a sicko man killing an innocent girl, but not OK to write about a worn-out emotionally-abused caregiver acting out her pain by killing her mother.  They are both fiction!!  Sigh....I read Alice Sebold's Lucky: A Memoir, about her own experience of violence and its lasting effects, after hearing an interview with her on NPR.  One thing I really appreciated about that book was that she didn't try to make the experience redemptive in any way, nor herself look like any kind of great suffering heroine made better by what she went through.  She was made worse, and said so, showed it, and showed how hard it is to recover from such a thing, if one can recover it all.(I saw the movie Brothers yesterday, also open-ended on whether one can fully recover from some experiences of violence.   Whether we do them, witness them, or have them done to us.)I appreciate writing that goes to this dark place and doesn't make it turn out OK.   But I know some people will avoid such subject matter, not wishing to face what violence really does in the world--whether in war or in peace.  I have seen men get terribly upset over the writing, legal work, and reporting of Catherine MacKinnon--for instance, telling it like it is about soldiers raping women in Bosnia.It suddenly occurs to me that perhaps I heard MacKinnon speak at Kenyon, when Linda Boreman, aka \"Linda Lovelace,\" of Deep Throat, came to Gambier to speak about her experience of making that film and others with her then husband.  Maybe Doug remembers this.  The film star was certainly accompanied by a feminist speaker, and MacKinnon was someone who was interested in Boreman's situation and in opposing pornography as a civil rights issue, due to the complexities of women's involvement in such films and sex-work professions.And now we come to choice.  I have no problem with people avoiding a film like The Lovely Bones because they don't want to have that kind of mental/emotional experience in the theatre.  It's understandable that we might not want to witness violence or emotional trauma of that sort.Likewise, people can easily avoid pornography!  We have a choice of what to read or what to see in a theatre. But people do not always have the choice to avoid or escape violence, or sexual harrassment or abuse.  Even, as in Linda Boreman's case, if they work in a field they seem to have chosen.  In many cases, people who work in those fields have not had a plain and simple \"chosen\" career path at all.  Early abuse, often mixed with economic and emotional deprivations, have led many that way.  So I am troubled by easy judgements and dismissals in these areas. And I am troubled by anyone taking away somebody else's choice.  Puts me in a sort of spiderweb, sticky and icky, vulnerable whether I'm the spider or the fly.It's true, I would like us to look harder at the things hard to look at.  So would my husband, who paints agony.  Down to the lovely bones."},

But Twisted River will remain with me forever.  A wonderful read.\"(Rebecca was reading this one, too!)What is it about John Irving books?!  This has happened to so many people I know.  They have read one, and that leads them to another, and they find a favorite, and that becomes a favorite for all times, among all authors, for them.  Irving takes us on a wild ride.I remember the roller coaster of The World According to Garp, how it made me laugh out loud, how shocked tears sprang to my eyes when bad things happened to characters I loved, how he could let terrible things happen to people in the book as in the world, but also defend them and do something to protect them and write bitterly against the ones doing the harm, all while still making me laugh.A Prayer for Owen Meany, which I've mentioned here that I finally read recently, took me back through history I'd lived without knowing it was history...and through a fictional experience that is now like life lived.  I met people I care about, admire, and am sorry to have lost.Phyllis, I think you'd like Cider House Rules, yes, and also Owen Meany.

{"title": "Killer Bees", "date": "Friday, March 5, 2010", "text": "Day 24 of the \"What are you reading, and why?\" project.Jo is reading Murder on the Eiffel Tower by Claude Izner, the first in a series of Victor Legris mysteries. It’s a historical mystery, taking place in Paris in 1889, during the World Exposition.Reminds me of Devil in the White City, by Erik Larson, taking place in 1893 at the World Columbian Exposition in Chicago. This one is not a novel but speculative non-fiction based on historical facts, looking closely at the architecture.Bees play a key part in Murder on the Eiffel Tower as the victims appear to die from bee stings.I loved the book Bee Season by Myla Goldberg! It is not about actual bees. Instead, spelling bees. Since I love words and word origins, this was a great book for me, as letters and roots and languages and meanings whirl around in the main character’s head…Which reminds me of Woman in Mind (December Bee), a play by Alan Ayckbourn. I just told you I can’t read plays, but I am reading this one because Julie wants me to. (Perhaps she wants me to be in it, as she is on the play reading committee for a local theatre.) Which reminds me of Trouble in Mind, a movie, and a Johnny Cash song. It’s used a lot as a title, in fact, for music, books, even a book of poems by Lucie Brock-Boido, whose name sort of bounces off the walls like words and letters in Bee Season.Which was also made into a movie, not to be confused with Spellbound, a documentary about spelling bees, which I watched at the home of Lizabeth, from whom I have borrowed many excellent books! And isn't there also a play, maybe even a musical comedy, about spelling bees?Of course, Spellbound is also a Hitchcock movie with Ingrid Bergman and Gregory Peck (my heart throb, Atticus Finch), a psychological thriller murder mystery. I don’t think there are bees in it. But there are bees in The Secret Life of Bees by Sue Monk Kidd, and of course there is also a movie of that. I am not even going to attempt free association with killer bee movies and Attack of the Killer Tomatoes.But I will say that Secret Life of Bees and Bee Season are books that came out close enough together that people got confused…as I am now…and that I sometimes find them near each other on the floor at Babbitt’s, waiting to be shelved, or to be picked up by people browsing. I don’t dare walk down the fiction aisle at Babbitt’s, or I will, as I did Tuesday, pick something up and put a yellow post-it on it, “Hold for Kathleen,” and then buy it, when I can rummage up the $6-8. Post-it-ed at the moment: The Wishbones by Tom Perotta and White Noise by Don DeLillo. These, though by men, and contemporary, and no doubt containing some humor and/or irony, are probably not “dick lit,” as defined earlier (via Internet searches), just as the bee books by women are not “chick lit.”And now I should reveal that Victor Legris of the historical mystery series is a bookseller. So far people have told me they like mysteries for the suspense, the puzzle, the psychological insights, the great research into place and time period, the escapes into a world evil confronted by justice, etc., but if anything would draw me in to a mystery series, it would be this! The bookstore connection!Keep those comments and book insights & recommendations coming!"},
{"title": "Twists of the Screws", "date": "Thursday, March 4, 2010", "text": "Day 23 of the “What are you reading, and why?” project.Mike is reading L. P. Hartley’s novel The Go-Between, written in the 1950s and set in 1900, before the two world wars. It is a romance and a coming-of-age novel, with mystery and trouble, innocence and awareness. Might remind some readers or filmgoers of Atonement by Ian McEwan.I first encountered The Go-Between as a film with Julie Christie and probably missed much of what was going on. Same thing happened when I saw The Innocents, the truly scariest film I ever saw as a child, with Deborah Kerr, in black and white, based on Henry James’s short story “The Turn of the Screw,” which I then read to try to figure out what the heck was going on. It’s actually a long short story, a novella. The children are go-betweens in this tale, too. Reading it did not help me understand it any better, but it wasn’t as scary.Same thing happened when I read Lolita, the wonderful, icky book by Vladimir Nabokov. I saw the black-and-white film with Shelley Winters and couldn’t see what all the fuss was about, read the book and was even more confused. Sometimes I think I am an idiot. (I can’t read plays, either. I have to see them. Or be in them.)Then one of my college students had the same kind of reaction to Lolita, the book. What was all the fuss about? Meaning, where was the sex? She also watched the film, the newer version. This was part of a research paper assignment on banned books. Tell us why it was banned, what was the outcome of the attempt to ban it, whether you agree or disagree, etc. People really got into it, I am glad to say. In her presentation, my student stressed the lollipop on the cover of the film box.I should pause here to mention that Rebecca, who is reading Her Fearful Symmetry AND Last Night in Twisted River, is also listening to Reading Lolita in Tehran on CD, or she was when I first asked the question, “What are you reading?” She’s had a couple sick kids and a sick self since then, so I hope she has been resting and pushing fluids, as they say.Her Fearful Symmetry is by Audrey Niffenegger, who wrote The Time Traveler’s Wife, the first book we read in my local book group. I had met Audrey briefly one summer at Printers Row Book Fair in Chicago, but in her other capacity as a paper maker and paper artist. I enjoyed that book, have not seen the movie version, and hope to read this latest eventually. It appears to be a ghost story, which takes us back to James.Both Henry James and Edith Wharton spent some time with ghost stories, an ever popular genre, rich with psychological possibility and money-making potential! James had kept ambiguity in the story on purpose, and Truman Capote added another layer of psychological ambiguity as one of the screenwriters for The Innocents. (By the way, a screenwriter for The Go-Between was the notoriously subtle, twisty, rich, and confusing Harold Pinter.) “The Turn of the Screw” was then remade into a completely different film, The Others, with Nicole Kidman, now a sort of psychological thriller ghost story horror film with a war context.Ah, literature and film, the twists and turns.Ah, this blog, the twists and turns and screwiness."},
{"title": "\"Enlightenment is a Bitch\"", "date": "Wednesday, March 3, 2010", "text": "Day 22 of the \"What are you reading, and why?\" project.Kim is reading The Sun, issue 411, March 2010, as am I, because it arrived in the mail this past week.The Sun is a wonderful print magazine published by Sy Safransky in Chapel Hill, NC, that has no advertisements* and relies entirely on your subscriptions for its survival, so please consider reading and subscribing! I got hooked on The Sun when Kim sent me a gift subscription one year for Christmas. (Plus, I should say I am also now hooked on Kim's blog, Hummus Anonymous!)She drew my attention to the first poem in this month's issue, \"Enlightenment is a Bitch,\" by Dane Cervine, a writer, guitar player, and Tarot reader in Santa Cruz County, CA, by saying she wished she had written it!! It is indeed a delightful, wise, and funny poem. It resonates for me alongside Molly Peacock's poem, \"Why I Am Not a Buddhist,\" and a moment in Clay's Quilt by Silas House, when the drunken Anneth insists that everybody wake up and look at the moon!I know Kim was just reading Clay's Quilt because we are in the same book group, and because she just turned it back in at the library on Saturday (via the Jewel book drop-off), and I was able to check it out on Monday, thanks to the nice woman at the circulation desk who went down to the carts in the basement to retrieve it for me. I love living in a small town! So now, finally, I am reading Clay's Quilt, a week before we discuss it. (Note to self: remember the hush puppies!)Rumi had his friend Shams. I have my friend Kim, having parallel reading experiences with me and enlightening me to the joys of hummus! Ah, life is good.I should pause to say that Kim and I don't have exactly the same kind of relationship as Rumi and Shams may have had, and that I will be back soon with a blog entry on gay lit, about which I know next to nothing, but, fortunately, I have the comments of a friend to share with you.In the same issue of The Sun is the poem \"Turning Fifty,\" by Paul Hostovsky, one of my favorite poets from my days as a poetry editor! This poem, too, is wise and delightful. Seek it out. How can you resist a man whose contributor bio reads, \"On his daily commute he reads Braille with his right hand while steering with his left.\" Although I am a little scared about this...preferring hands-free devices, no texting or cell phones while driving, etc. Plus, is the right hand supposed to know what the left hand is doing? At any rate, I love the poems of Paul Hostovsky.And while we are at this enlightenment business, Douglas is reading Be Here Now by Ram Dass.The Ram Dass book no doubt connects to some aspects of the interview with Tim Farrington in this same issue of The Sun. D. Patrick Miller has conducted the interview in the article \"Till Morning Comes: Tim Farrington on Creativity, Depression, and The Dark Night of the Soul,\" and, if you are a regular follower of my blog since its inception--that is, if you are Kim--you may recall my recent mention of The Dark Night of the Soul, by St. John of the Cross, who wrote it in prison. It is a poem, and a love poem at that, followed by the saint's own explication, pertinent to nuns, monks, and all spiritual seekers. I read it in the excellent translation by Mirabai Starr. (Amazon calls her Mirabel, but she's Mirabai.)St. John of the Cross, Tim Farrington, and Dane Cervine all seem to agree that \"enlightenment is a bitch\" in its \"dark night\" or depression stage, which is, as Farrington says, a sort of fever that heats the body to heal it. Farrington also notes, as might Ram Dass, that the \"stages\" are not really progressive or linear but simultaneous.Have I mentioned that I don't really believe in linear time? If you are Kim, you know I have!*But The Sun is advertising a Job Opening for a digital-media director on p. 3 and at their website!   So if you are digital and in need of a job, hey, go there!So, what print magazines do you read regularly? News magazines, literary magazines, general interest magazines, special interest magazines...and why?!"},

Kim points out that these are a combination of mystery and chick lit, and maybe she will tell us more about why she enjoys this series!We get a lot of requests for Evanovich at the bookstore. We don't carry romances, but we do have mysteries, lots of them, contemporary and vintage, hardback and paperback, and Evanovich is now at Babbitt's, or in and out quickly, in the mystery section, or sometimes on the little New Arrivals in Fiction shelf right by the front door.Or, for something completely different, you can read Thomas Hardy. Will it be Return of the Native or Jude the Obscure? A man was asking for our recommendations yesterday, but our sales manager who is also a Hardy scholar is not there on Mondays, so I said I thought Jane Smiley recommended Jude the Obscure, but I was wrong. What I was misremembering, from 13 Ways of Looking at the Novel, was indeed crucial, but it was this: \"When critics greeted Jude the Obscure with scathing rejection, Thomas Hardy shut down his novelist persona completely and went on as a poet, but in a different and more robust vein than he had written in as a novelist.\" So, in search of excitement in reading, we might turn to robust poetry.I read a lot of Hardy when I was younger, so young that I cannot remember much, except for Tess of the d'Urbervilles, also read in school, and made into movies. Oddly, this brings me back to chick lit and its robust women of self-determination, sort of the opposite of the Tess plot and the fate of loving and generous women who dared to have sex when Hardy was writing novels.

{"title": "Falling Man", "date": "Monday, March 1, 2010", "text": "Day 20 of the “What are you reading, and why?” project. March 1. I am hoping March will come in and go out like a lamb.Anna is reading Falling Man by Don DeLillo because she recently watched 10 straight hours of video on the 9/11 event. She was doing this in part because she was ready to learn about it, after being overwhelmed when it first happened, and in part because she was writing poems with political/historical themes. She will read her own poem about a falling man at the McLean County Museum of History tomorrow, Tuesday, March 2, at 7:30 p.m. Because the whole thing chokes her up, she will take a short break from Falling Man until the poetry reading is over, so she is not overcome by emotion during the event.In the last two blog entries, I got a little worried about Jonathan Safran Foer, but he can probably take care of himself. He has also written about the 9/11 event, in Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close. I don’t know whether to recommend it to Anna, so I will read it myself first, but I have some trepidation about reading it and/or the DeLillo book...When I worked as a poetry editor, we got a slew of poems, almost immediately, about 9/11, and there was a lot of stuff zinging across the Internet, too. W.H. Auden’s poem \"September 1, 1939,\" from a different era, went around, but also plenty of raw stuff, email exchanges, collage poetry. I had the icky feeling a lot of it was exploitation poetry, not really that person’s story to tell, a roiling of rage and grief, mixed with self-importance about what, now, was the only thing worth writing about, or worth reading, and which would, incidentally, get that poet her/his brief fiery 15 minutes of fame.So I am hoping the DeLillo and Foer books are not exploiting that terrible event, but exploring it. Telling the truth about it in ways that don’t…what?—do further damage.Bruce Weigl, a poet who managed the impossible in a poem called \"The Impossible\" (which I leave you to seek out on your own, as it is too shocking for many readers--it is in his book What Saves Us)--that is, to tenderly transform something horrific into something...impossibly beautiful, closes the poem with his ars poetica: “Say it clearly and you make it beautiful, no matter what.” Some critic told Weigl he ought to have said it the other way around: \"Say it beautifully and you make it clear...,\" but it was not beautiful, what had happened to him, then, and what he witnessed, later, during the Vietnam War, which ruined him and made him a writer. “When one is traumatized,” says Weigl, “the world recedes, and when the trauma stops, the world gradually returns, only things are different.”Things are different. It would be awful to pretend they are not.I hope Foer and DeLillo are saying it clearly. Without pretense, without exploitation. Revealing the beautiful, horrific, deep, ugly, tender truths."},
{"title": "Lad Lit & Traveling Pants", "date": "Sunday, February 28, 2010", "text": "Day 19 of the \"What are you reading, and why?\" project.Julie, who tried to comment yesterday, informs me that the Brits have a more polite term than \"dick lit,\" and one it might be easier to click on at Google--\"lad lit.\" (Julie, I checked email and junk mail, and, alas, your comment is lost in cyberspace.) She also sends us to Jennifer Weiner, a writer of this so-called \"chick lit\" for illumination on that topic. (I am sending you to the Wikipedia article on her, which summarizes the debate, and offers links to various follow-up articles. Weiner has a blog, where you can seek out more of her opinions on the \"chick lit\" debate. I am fascinated by the \"pecking order\" issues here, and also think of Mean Girls and Tina Fey and comic justice, etc.)NobleSavage sends us to a wonderful article by Katie Roiphe in the New York Times, \"The Naked and the Conflicted.\" And this reminded me why I was reading all that Updike, Bellow, Roth, and then Irving, etc.--because my parents were. Updike was their man, their generation, and I was reading to learn how to live in their world, how to grow up, etc., and there was a heck of a lot I didn't understand in life and, of course, in those books!This relates to aka Simone's comment, too, about having a better reading experience with writers or main characters of her own generation. My niece enjoyed the Traveling Pants books, but I, no doubt, would not read very far into one of those books...at my age.Roife quotes Philip Roth in a scene from The Counterlife that came all too vividly back to me: “The sight of the Zipper King’s daughter sitting on the edge of the bathtub with her legs flung apart, wantonly surrendering all 5 feet 9 inches of herself to a vegetable, was as mysterious and compelling a vision as any Zuckerman had ever seen.” Whatever I thought at the time, I am old enough now to find this hilarious, and to connect it to all sorts of things I have seen or read since--which includes the \"scary\" bathtub scene from the movie The 40-Year-Old Virgin* and, oddly enough, that completely woman-centered book, Our Bodies, Ourselves, which I confess to owning in two editions, the first (in paperback) and the recently re-issued (purchased via my phone bill from Working Assets Long Distance a few years back). That also advocates vegetables as a route to female pleasure. Sigh... Is there such a thing as zucchini lit yet?*And while we are at it, I may as well confess to having been a virgin till my wedding night, thanks to reading way too much \"literary\" fiction in which young girls were \"ruined\" by having sex before marriage. (Perhaps there were other reasons as well. But I'm 53 and looking back, and this seems likely to me. I find it both poignant and funny. And it was not sex but marriage that \"ruined\" me. I'm OK now.) I confess to this because this is the kind of personal writing that makes it so easy for women who say such things to be dismissed! And yet if male writers say such things or have their characters confess to such things, or act from odd inner compulsions, it's still OK. (Or maybe it isn't. See the death of lad lit below.)And here I will further pause and say that please understand I am not dismissing any writers or readers in exploring these or other labels that turn up in the world of reading. People read a variety of things for a variety of reasons, and I want to hear more about what these reasons are. If SarahJane chooses, as she says in her comment, not to read Jonathan Safran Foer because some guy at Amazon put him on a \"dick lit\" list, and I repeated it here, that's her choice, and OK by me, but also a shame, and I'm sorry. I don't want to lose a reader for Foer, and I loved Everything Is Illuminated. It's funny around a heartbroken core, and you've got to do something with that kind of heartbreak. Foer makes history live again in ways that break my own heart, as I read, and teach me how to live with greater compassion and greater conviction to do no harm, moment by moment.And that, I continue to find, is why I read. It helps me live, it gives me the courage to be as kind as I can possibly be, and I am not always kind, and not always thoughtful, so I keep reading, and, sometimes, it gives me the courage to say no to some things that must not happen in this world because they do terrible harm, and to do what I can about that. My life is small, my reading is larger than I am. Maybe I will grow large enough to do a little kindness in the world.(That's my annoying confession. I have friends who, dismissively, call me Pollyanna. And others who, kindly, see me as a sort of Amelie! Dix-cinq!)OK, but it turns out that Lad Lit, the politer name for Dick Lit, actually refers to a more confessional sort of literature written by men, about men, but probably for readers of any kind. Nick Hornby is indeed on the \"lad lit\" list, and is also credited, in the link above, as its \"daddy.\" (By the way, the only Hornby I've read is How to be Good, which has a female main character. And I'm not sure I learned how to be good from it! I learned that the phrase is laden, and our human motives complicated, etc., which rings true to me.) So Lad Lit may well be different from Dick Lit, and, getting back to the Roiphe article, which I recommend, it explores issues of male identity. Roiphe's selected quotations emphasize the ambivalence men may feel these days about \"male identity,\" if there is such a thing, and about sex. Roiphe quotes a Benjamin Kunkel character saying, “Feeling extremely uncouth, I put my penis away. I might have thrown it away if I could.”Roiphe is contrasting this with the vigor and joy of the penis in novels by a previous generation of men writers, men that some feminists have tossed away, and there is a pertinent trashcan in her essay, and I am saddened to think than some men have to feel this way about that body part or about what they might write. I don't want the writers of dick lit or lad lit dismissed, or to dismiss themselves, just as I don't want women writers, of \"chick lit,\" or \"literary\" fiction, or \"confessional\" lit, or whatever we happen to call any of it, to be dismissed, simply because they are female or write about women and their personal matters. Where did I recently read a woman writer saying, \"Women know that the personal is the political,\" as if that argument was long done, and this was fully accepted? I'm not sure it is, and I don't think this chick lit vs. lad lit conversation is done, either.Even though some articles tell me that \"lad lit\" is dead, that it died in 2004, etc.Lad lit might not be dead, if people are still writing it and reading it. But David Foster Wallace is dead. People are still reading him. And to acknowledge the icky marketing aspect of all this--that \"chick lit\" and \"dick lit\" and \"lad lit\" are labels for the convenience of book marketing, book reviewing, and bookstore organization. etc.--I will confess that our first editions of Wallace suddenly became hot commodities upon his death.But our weekend manager, Tim, put a notice on the door as soon as he got the news. A passerby took a picture of it with his phone, and within the hour a reporter from Chicago called the store to interview Tim, who had been one of Wallace's students at ISU. Babbitt's was Wallace's favorite bookstore, which he apparently said somewhere once in print, according to my boss, the owner. My niece (a different niece, not the Traveling Pants niece) was saddened both by Wallace's death, in itself, but also because she was registered for his course the following semester at her college in California, and now she wouldn't learn what he had to say about writing. And that's my little Amelie moment of rest-in-peace."},

Is it a mostly a marketing tag, identifying its hoped-for and most likely audience, etc.?  Is it feminist or anti-feminist?  Or is it detached from the idea of labels as suggestive of any kind of evaluative determination, and primarily, instead, about fun? As in, “Girls just want to have fun!”  (Cyndi Lauper in your head now?)  (By coincidence, I saw Baby Mama again last night, so she's in my head.)Does chick lit have to contain shopping in general and shoes in specific?Of course, the answers to all my questions of definition can easily be found in Wikipedia, or, with further research, in numerous articles by teachers, critics, and scholars of chick lit:Chick lit has a self-determining female protagonist who is able to solve her problems with gumption and humor.  Chick lit is indeed marketed to female readers, etc.  Early chick lit writers, before the term was a term, are among the greats—Jane Austen, for example, herself ever popular among female readers.  Bridget Jones’s Diary by Helen Fielding descends quite consciously and comically from Pride and Prejudice.  Et cetera.I ask partly because the other day I was pondering that thing that happens when a man is intimate or personal or sensitive in his writing, and the world goes, “Oh, he’s so brave!” etc., and a woman is intimate, etc. in her writing, and the world goes, “Poo, she’s so confessional!”He talks about masturbation.  “Bold!” She talks about her period.  “Yuck.”He talks about his penis. “What else is there to talk about?” She mentions her vagina.  “Guffaw.”And so on.   And I think this is still happening. So I wondered, “If there is such a thing as ‘chick lit,’ why isn’t there ‘dick lit’?” And, of course, there is.  Turns out I have read plenty of it: Everything is Illuminated by Jonathan Safran Foer, various books by Nick Hornby.  Probably Lamb and so on by Christopher Moore.  That’s, by extrapolation, according to some men who have posted lists at Amazon or thereabouts.I have to tell you I was afraid to Google “dick lit” and then afraid to click anything with a dick in it.  At Wikipedia, I only got an article about Moby Dick, which is not funny enough to be dick lit, and I didn’t click very far among lists and blogs, but I got the gist of it.Dick lit is essentially chick lit for men.(And you can check this out at Urban Dictionary.  Where the younger male audience is specified, but the examples point to the older male audience for virile adventure fiction.  Of course, I realize now, from handling a lot of pulp fiction and men's romance at Babbitt's, that there was plenty of dick lit before there was this term, as with chick lit.)So if it has a sense of humor and is written by a man, it’s dick lit, and if it has a sense of humor and is written by a woman, it’s chick lit, as long as it has a self-determining protagonist who is male or female.  (Next, we may get Pat lit.)  At least there is indeed equal time for reproductive parts out there in popular literature.So I ask you, is there anything you’ve read that you’d like to label chick lit or dick lit?Who has read some “chick lit,” and why?  For fun, for book groups, for a college class.  And what are we/you looking for in that kind of book?  Fun?  A good story?  Romance?  Someone to identify with?  Self-determination?Have any men among us read anything that someone else calls “chick lit”?  And would you be embarrassed to be caught reading it?  If so, why?I was embarrassed to click dick lit, but I was not embarrassed to read Hornby, Foer, or Moore.  Is John Irving dick lit?  Is Saul Bellow intellectual dick lit?  What about Philip Roth?  I’m pretty sure Portnoy’s Complaint is dick lit."},
{"title": "Happy Birthday, Elizabeth George", "date": "Friday, February 26, 2010", "text": "Day 17 of the \"What are you reading, and why?\" project, and the topic of mysteries has provoked the most discussion so far!So, Happy Birthday, Elizabeth George, creator of the Inspector Lynley series of mysteries, as I learn from today's Writer's Almanac, to which I have linked you, thank Garrison Keillor very much! I love her daily writing schedule: lift weights, Today Show, read 15 minutes of great lit, write in a journal...all great warm-up activities...and then launch into the long writing workday!This coincides with so much of the advice in Letters to a Fiction Writer, the book edited by Frederick Busch that gathers lots of advice and encouragement from many writers, many of whom say, in various ways, \"write every day.\" (And I've been reading a letter a day in it, along with writing this daily blog!) A woman at the birthday party poetry reading event on Feb. 20 asked me, \"Do you write every day?\" and I was able to answer yes!--because I changed my life, as Rilke advised poets to do, and so did Elizabeth George!Of course she writes the kind of book that lots of people like to read. I write the kind of book that lots of people like to avoid! You can, I am sure, pre-order George's newest book, This Body of Death, due out in April, now. (Yes, you can, so that's the link.)Who is reading this series? Let me know in the comments!And be sure to check out the fabulous comments on that previous mystery entry, as people are saying powerful, profound, and provocative things! Me, I'm saying goofy things, like, \"Neatorino!\"And while we are at it, let's also celebrate crime writer Patricia Highsmith.  (That's a link to Gretta Barclay's review of a biography, posted in Escape into Life, an online journal.)Oh, but wait a minute! I did once write a murder-mystery sort of poem, and it is online in the archives of Oklahoma Review, so I will link you to that. Poetry usually makes people run screaming away, and this may do so for other reasons! I wrote it in response to a writing-prompt question, \"How would you dispose of a dead body?\" Of course, as I was writing, it turned into something else, but it's still creepy. You are well warned: \"How to Dispose of a Dead Body.\"But I also wanted to tell you that the train-to-Texas-guy came back! He bought 3 train books, and he will return! (He is the guy I was afraid I scared off in one of my suddenly intimate conversations somehow totally appropriate to the moment...unless I am wrong, and they are not. Appropriate. Anyway, he is indeed the nice guy I thought he was, and there were all these other people around, so I could not set him up with my ready-to-date friend. How's that for a sweet little comic mystery romance?!)Oooh, but don't let him read my poem."},
{"title": "Sonneteers, Rattle", "date": "Thursday, February 25, 2010", "text": "Day 16 of the \"What are you reading, and why?\" project.I think Dick must be reading Rattle, a literary magazine that publishes Poetry for the 21st Century, because he gave me the Winter 2009 \"Tribute to the Sonnet\" issue as a birthday present at a party that was also a release reading for my little chapbook Broken Sonnets. (I told you I might tell you more about that, and here we go!)Dick is a close friend of the party host, Michael, and both are great readers of Robert Frost, a favorite poet of many. I got to hear them read Frost and talk about him at some events many years ago, and Michael read some Frost for WGLT's Poetry Radio!This issue of Rattle also has conversations with Alice Fulton and Molly Peacock, two poets I admire and got to hear when they read in the Chicago area. I have Molly Peacock's Original Love, Take Heart, and Cornucopia, and she taught me a lot about form, since she works with very tight rhyming forms in order to handle otherwise out-of-control emotion. This is something I have been able to recommend to other poets who are working with volatile personal material, and my little poetry workshop at Babbitt's requested to learn more about formal poems in a recent session.Alice Fulton came to town (Chicago) to read, I think, at North Park College, or Northeastern (?), and also at DePaul, when I was at DePaul (but I attended the small college reading, conflict at the other time or something, or maybe she was reading to a particular class). We got to meet her artist husband, and I have an artist husband, so we had a very nice conversation with him. So I have her books Palladium and Dance Script with Electric Ballerina. Palladium is organized in sections that begin with different definitions of the word \"palladium,\" and I loved learning all this, as well as reading her poems. As Emily Dickinson said, \"There are words to which I tip my hat when I see them sitting on a page...\" and \"palladium\" is one of them!Back to Rattle, which has skeletons on the cover, so we can rattle them bones, and sonnets, etc. I was delighted to find a sonnet by Ernest Hilbert in this issue. (Hilbert's recent book of sonnets is on my wishlist at Amazon!) His Rattle sonnet is called \"Cover to Cover\" and describes towers of books in \"shoddy columns\" that \"slide onto the stove, under the fridge, / Into the tub,\" etc. (For non-poetry readers, that slash mark indicates a line break, which is also why \"Into\" is capitalized, as it begins a new line, though not all poets these days capitalize the first letter of every line!) So, essentially, in this poem about \"the collector's passion\" (in an opening quotation by Walter Benjamin), we see huge amounts of books, reminding me of my own home and my workplace!!On the facing page is a sonnet by Carol Frith, who, with her husband, the poet Laverne Frith, is an editor of Ekphrasis, which has taken several of my poems in response to paintings! So that was a delightful surprise. Carol's poem, \"Black Tights, Halter Top,\" looks closely at a woman who might be a prostitute, might be a runaway, waiting on a street corner \"near a ragged sign that reads: / For sale.\" This is so evocative for me, as well as being a vivid and empathetic picture in itself. My husband once gave a ride to a streetwalker stuck out in the Chicago rain on a dreary corner, moved by her circumstance. And he has a gorgeous collage painting of a woman \"On Sale,\" using strips of newspaper sale pages, a painting that now hangs in our bedroom, over my dresser, because I was lucky enough to receive it as a gift. (Other paintings I have loved are long gone, sold to those who admired them!)I love these personal connections we make to poems, which are fine if we also look closely enough at the poem to see how we connect to what's really there, a sort of compare/contrast adventure. This poem looks closely at the woman, and makes me look outside myself into her situation, as well as inside to our connection as women together on this earth. And then as humans. But she's in a tough spot, on a corner there, possibly for sale, because that is a shared experience of women in history. The poem makes me love her and feel her vulnerability. It ends: \"Persimmons, firm to the touch, and sweet.\"So I have not told you about the party at all. That will have to wait, because now I want to tell you about Garrison Keillor, mentioned at the end of the previous entry, and his book of sonnets! 77 Love Sonnets came out this summer when I was proofreading my own little book, and I waited till the fall, when my book was safely out, to get it and read it. What a dear book, and what a fine variety of sonnets, both tight to the form, and looser, matching the subject matter. It tracks a love affair and praises the beloved in swift, sensual poems that bring us right into a fine intimacy. We care about this couple, and this man loving her so much! And there are fine delicate drawings. And there is a 12-sonnet cycle of the months!Which reminds me!--back in Rattle there is a sonnet crown by Patricia Smith. A sonnet crown is a set of sonnets in which the next sonnet starts with the last line of the previous sonnet, and eventually circles back around to the first sonnet, creating a \"crown,\" although poets do variations on this circling back. Smith's is called \"Motown Crown\" and weaves in lots of the music from her growing-up years. It's amazing!I've read other sonnet crowns, heard some read aloud, and have written one myself, though mine breaks, the way my \"broken sonnets\" break...oh, someday I'll tell you more about that."},
{"title": "Gender Studies & Faking It", "date": "Wednesday, February 24, 2010", "text": "Day 15 of the \"What are you reading, and why?\" project. (Don't forget to comment on the \"why\" part, here and in any previous entry!!)Tom is reading Misfortune, by Wesley Stace, about a boy raised as a girl in the 19th century. A man finds a baby in a trash heap (where, alas, we know babies to be left even today) and brings it home. I say \"it\" because the baby boy is presented to the world as a baby girl...for as long as that deception can hold.Turns out the novelist Wesley Stace is actually the musician John Wesley Harding, which is not so much a deception as a pseudonym, something writers are known sometimes to choose. At the above link to an Amazon page, you can listen to 3 of the songs he connects to the book, which winds music into the plot.Deception and gender-bending identity are, however, crucial to the book Girl Boy Girl: How I Became JT LeRoy by Savannah Knoop. Knoop, a woman, pretended to be JT LeRoy, a transgendered man, enjoying six years of glamor and celebrity as a hip novelist before being exposed. The novels attributed to LeRoy were really written by Laura Albert, Knoop's sister-in-law, and it's not hard to imagine why two people looking for a way to survive as writers in our celebrity-driven fast-food culture might come up with a scam like this one. Sigh... And, indeed, \"faking it\" doesn't seem to have hurt Knoop too much. She has her own author page at Amazon, where we learn she is now designing clothes in San Francisco.I learned about JT and company in the current issue of The Common Review, the magazine of the Great Books Foundation, where the Knoop book is reviewed by Krista Eastman, so I know what she's been reading! In the same article she reviewed Fakers, Hoaxers, Con Artists, Counterfeiters, and Other Great Pretenders by Paul Maliszewski, and her review mentions Stephen Glass, who fabricated articles for The New Republic and about whom a movie was made, Shattered Glass, a great title, featuring Hayden Christensen, Peter Sarsgaard, Chloe Sevigny, Rosario Dawson, Steve Zahn, Melanie Lynskey, and Hank Azaria.I actually own this film, and several others about writers, acquired for teaching a course on writers and their lives, and another on famous plagiarism/fabrication cases. I mentioned this plagiarism course in an earlier blog entry about Rick Bragg, whom commenter NobleSavage called \"a known fake.\" I think it is indeed well known that Bragg left the New York Times because he did what he did, which was use the eye-witness reporting of a stringer as if it were his own eye-witnessing, without crediting the stringer. In reading further about that case, I discovered, however icky this is, that it was common practice then at the NYT not to credit interns and stringers for their contributions, and that Bragg wasn't the only one who did this. He was the one who did this and got called on it, so he resigned. After the Jayson Blair scandal, which did involve \"faking it,\" or fabricating his supposed journalism, the New York Times changed its practices. But by then Blair had brought down his higher-ups, and Bragg had brought himself down.To learn more about the Bragg scandal, check out this article by Howard Kurtz in the Washington Post, one of the early reports, and, of course, Wikipedia!Or, to have more fun than that, read Misfortune or Girl Boy Girl, or another book about \"faking it.\"But back to gender studies! Like Garrison Keillor in today's Writer's Almanac, I say Happy Birthday to Judith Butler, who writes about gender and identity and, sometimes, the inherent comedy of sexual positions!"},

I was delighted and honored, let me tell you!!What I did not know until recently is that they are a bunch of SOBs.  That's what they call themselves!  SOB = Society of Books.  Here's what the SOBs are reading as the year continues:March:  Maud Martha by Gwendolyn BrooksApril: The English Major by Jim HarrisonMay:  Mayflower by Nathaniel PhilbrickI notice at Amazon that Maud Martha is only available from the Marketplace sellers, so it appears to be out of print and harder to find, though I will look for it at Babbitt's, as some of these SOBs will no doubt come in hoping to find it there!  Gwendolyn Brooks was a great poet, and I think this is her only novel!  Reader reviews suggest it is written poetically, and I'm sure it will be wonderful experience.   I hope the SOBs will come back and tell me about it!My life intersected with Gwendolyn's only glancingly, though we both lived in Chicago.  Once I was a finalist and got to read on the Chopin Theatre stage in the Guild Complex annual Gwendolyn Brooks Open Mic competition.  What a thrill, made even scarier by the fact that, by lottery, I was the very first reader of the evening.  The marvelous poet Lucy Anderton won my set and went on to win the event!!And once I was asked to contribute poems and play myself, a poet, in an educational television series called Simply Poetry, produced by the media relations department at Illinois State University...because they couldn't afford Gwendolyn Brooks, their first choice!  That series would turn up at odd times in random cities on cable television, and I would hear from relatives or friends, \"Hey, I saw you on TV.\"  (I never saw it, as I never had cable!)  My mom was in all the episodes as the English teacher.  I was in just the one, as a guest poet who comes to class.This past weekend, I got to read again from Broken Sonnets at a house concert event, with poetry, guitar, and dance!  I told them what Garrett, one of the SOBs, said about the book when he read and discussed it with his group: \"Oh, yes, we found all sorts of things in the poems that you didn't know were there!\"I hope the SOBs will eventually enlighten me!And be sure to read the enlightening comments from mystery readers after that post, below!"},
{"title": "Why do we read mysteries?", "date": "Monday, February 22, 2010", "text": "Day 13 of the \"What are you reading, and why?\" project. Why do we read mysteries?! I don't actually read very many mysteries, but I notice that lots of people do, and that I eventually see some very popular mysteries after they are made into movies!People come into Babbitt's Books and go straight to the mystery aisle and walk out with stacks of books. Sometimes they bring lists, so they won't buy the same book again, and sometimes they don't bring lists and do buy the same book twice. Which leads me back to the why question above. If the mystery was so forgettable, why the urge to repeat the experience? But maybe that is the answer in itself, and relates to my earlier comment about eating short stories. Do some of us read mysteries because it is like eating something we enjoy eating? We could then extend the metapor to nutritious food vs. comfort food that is not always nutritious and literary vs genre fiction, but I am not an elitist like that, I see the wonderful blurrings and blendings of such categories, and I mostly see categories as a way of organizing knowledge and bookshelves/bookstore aisles--that is, I see categories as practical, not definitive nor evaluative. Even in science, the categories (species, planets, etc.) do not hold exactly--there are new definitions, changes, blurrings. So, feh.Specifically, why do we read murder mysteries? Is it to expose human evil, human motives?Earlier this morning, about 5ish, I mused on Shakespeare. Macbeth seems clearly designed to show us the inadvisability of committing a murder to 1) impress the wife or 2) get ahead in life. Likewise, Hamlet invites us to question the urge for revenge played out as murder. Is the urge to avenge someone else's death just our own evil, similarly exposed, or really a messenger from God or the return of the Furies? Is revenge really about justice at all? Hamlet has a hard time deciding on this re: his father's ghost. Further, he has a hard time deciding whether it is a human's place at all to exact revenge, to take another human life. Shakespeare shows us it is probably not our place, as look at all this senseless violence, waste of life, etc. Something is rotten.... Fortinbras, please set things right!Also, why, in some murder mysteries, is murder the solution to the murderer's problem (money, sex, ambition, revenge) in the first place? Why is human life so disposable to him/her? How are we to understand this?So here are some of the mysteries people are reading:Laura is about to read The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo by Stieg Larsson, the first in a trilogy by a Swedish writer who died in 2004 from a heart attack. A guy came into Babbitt's the other day looking for the Swedish mysteries. I didn't realize at the time that the book I'd tucked onto my own hold shelf, Laura's book, was probably what he wanted! Robert is also reading the Larsson trilogy, which includes The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest and The Girl Who Played with Fire. These are described by readers and reviewers as page-turners that are very literary. They seem less like the \"forgettable\" titles one might swallow too quickly.Phyllis is about to read Whose Body by Dorothy Sayers, and Robert, Julie, and Tom all raved about Sayers's Gaudy Night, as well. (We have lots of Sayers fans at Babbitt's, too!) I would like to hear more about the appeal of these books, and why these particular mysteries are so compelling. Phyllis is reading Sayers in the context of her Mystery Book Club.To pursue genre blurring and human motive a bit more, I'll mention that Susan is reading The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle by Haruki Murakami, which seems to be an intricate look at evil as well as a detective story and a bunch of other things.So, tell me, why do you read murder mysteries?(And P.S., speaking of Hamlet, here is a different ending for Ophelia, thanks to her sassy gay friend, Second City Network, and Kevin Loomis!!)"},
{"title": "Barbara Kingsolver", "date": "Sunday, February 21, 2010", "text": "Day 12 of the \"What are you reading, and why?\" project, and I am back, via fabulous Amtrak, from birthday reading event in Chicago area.In a comment here, Etta said she is reading The Lacuna by Barbara Kingsolver, and I hope she will come back and tell us why, and more about her experience of the book.Kingsolver is our topic today (and I have linked to the Amazon Barbara Kingsolver page, so you can see the whole book array!) partly because she was in demand today at the bookstore!  People come in intermittently reading Kingsolver for book groups, and so we run out of Poisonwood Bible, but today we happened to have two copies, one hardback and one paperback, which made this woman very happy.  Poisonwood Bible is a favorite of my pastor, and several friends recommended it, so I read and enjoyed it, too. Also Prodigal Summer, which I loved, green dustjacket to moth-illustrated endpapers, and all.  (Turns out I have a first edition of this, too.  Who knew I was sort of a \"collector\"?)  I've got to say I loved learning about moths in this book.  I'm interested in how I do love this book as object, with its illustrations, as well as reading experience, which helps me understand why some people prefer the hardback first edition to the easy, light paperback reading copy.But usually, I don't care what edition or condition a book is in.  I just love the reading.  I'd love to here more about this aspect of reading, too.  There's a fellow I know who is waiting to read Flannery O'Connor till a nice hardback comes in to the store.  \"Nobody will give up their Flannery O'Connor,\" I keep telling him, but there are plenty of paperbacks if he just wants to read the stories....

S. 51 to her volleyball tournament and before I board the train north to Chicago for a birthday party poetry reading event there, a sort of house concert, with discussion, dance, and guitar!(Happy Birthday to me! Yippee. I love my birthday. Since time is not linear for me, I don’t even mind growing old! I like it! It makes me younger, in a Merlinesque kind of way. Ah, who is reading The Once and Future King? Anybody?!)Today I devote myself to books on reading (and some books on writing, which always include plenty about the importance of reading if you want to be a good writer). Behind me on my bookshelf is the wonderful book (another Babbitt’s find!), A History of Reading by Alberto Manguel. I love this book for its solid historical information, its pictures of the brain and the physiology of reading comprehension, and its wonderful contemplative tone. I used it to reference things I advocated to poets recently, in a little workshop on reading their poems aloud. Different parts of the brain are stimulated by reading and by hearing, so when we read aloud a poem that is also in the hands of our listeners, their brains are being stimulated in multiple ways. If they are just listening, we might want to read a poem twice, or slow it down, or give a little context, etc., to help the reader listen more attentively. When we read our work aloud, we are both seeing it and hearing it, so we are stimulated in the multiple ways, and can share some of that energy with our audience!You can read and hear an interview with Alberto Manguel about his newest book at PBS! The Artsbeat on the Newshour!Also on the shelf behind me is Reading Like a Writer, by Francine Prose, A Guide for People Who Love Books and For Those Who Want to Write Them. Oh, I do so enjoy reading about other people’s reading experiences, doing a bit of compare/contrast, getting inspired to read something new, just heard about, or to re-read something in light of what a writer like Prose has told me about a book. She provides a wonderful list of “Books to be Read Immediately” at the end, and it’s like that list of books that went around on Facebook, to be copied and pasted as a “Note,” checking off the ones you’d read, to compared with the lists of the friends you’d “tagged” or who had “tagged” you. (I remember when tag was a game we played in the park!)A favorite book of mine is Eudora Welty’s One Writer’s Beginnings, which recounts her voracious and indiscriminate reading as a child, and how, gradually, eventually, she became the kind of reader Prose is talking about, “reading like a writer.”One of the first things I did upon leaving my fulltime college teaching job was to read Jane Smiley’s book 13 Ways of Looking at the Novel, which is in large part a grand account of reading novels, with wonderful summaries provided at the end. I read this to get myself ready to return to writing my novel-in-progress (a novel in progress since before the birth of my second child, who is now 15), and I read everything but the chapter you are not supposed to read until you have completed the first draft of your novel. (Have I sighed lately? Sigh….) Of course I read Smiley’s novel Good Faith, because she uses it as a “case study” in this book. And I made mental notes to read many of the novels she writes about, and I see, looking back at my first edition, that I also made numerous pencil notes all over the text.(Instead of finishing my novel, by the way, I sat in my back yard for 4 years and did a lot of reading and wrote hundreds and hundreds of poems. I am math-challenged and have not been able actually to count them, but I suspect it is indeed hundreds and hundreds. They are collected into 3 chapbooks, already out, 4 more chapbook-length sections of a longer manuscript in progress, and might sort of count as a novel-in-poems, which has been done by other writers, except that there is narrative arc only in one of the sections…and, sigh, who reads poetry?! Or, to be more apt, who actually buys poetry? Which is why I work part time in a used bookstore. Anyway, I am very happy. Reading and writing is good for my soul.)So, as always, what are you reading? I’m talking books, here, in or out of print, but books you can hold in your hand and write notes on, or magazines and literary journals, etc. Print media. I am looking at the state of it. And, pertinent to today’s entry, what are you reading about reading?I will be back, on the train, tomorrow, and will, at some point, tell you what people I saw at the birthday party are reading."},
{"title": "Circus, Circus", "date": "Friday, February 19, 2010", "text": "Day 10 of the “What are you reading, and why?” project, and last night I had plenty of Internet, so I came down to my home office this morning full of energy at 5:45 a.m., still had it, and then, during the major-yet-routine virus scan of my machine, Internet went out. So, it’s something, and it’s something to do with stress and strain, and I am typing onto a regular document page to copy & paste into this blog later, and try to edit/adjust to avoid wacky spacing and add links.Have I sighed lately? Sigh….Anyhoo, back when I first asked my little question on Facebook, 10 days ago, “What are you reading?” Richard answered that he was reading Water for Elephants by Sara Gruen. I knew the answer to the “Why?” question this time was “for book group” because somebody else from his book group had come in looking for it. (I must pause to praise this particular book group, a courageous men’s book group that, back in December, read my little poetry chapbook Broken Sonnets, and discussed it. I was not there but heard, in summary, that they found all sorts of things I didn’t even know were in there, etc. I am honored. They also brought in their own favorite poems to share. And I think they did some drinking of beer.)So, book group. I told Richard, 10 days ago, that we have an actual circus elephant guy in our town, which, coincidentally used to be a big circus town, a “winter home” though one wonders why winter here if you could winter in Sarasota, Florida? But the answer is: big barns. The big barns were practice spaces for the fliers, the trapeze artists. Or maybe I misheard, and it was the \"summer home.\"Our local circus elephant guy started out with horses, tending to them in all kinds of ways but specifically their hooves, and the elephant care grew out of that. Just as in the novel, he saw some poor care of elephants by the circus, but he insisted on tending them properly, making sure they got enough food, water, rest. He had some run-ins with bosses, but he took care of his animals in the circus on Navy Pier, in Chicago.I used to meet him at the train station, this elephant man, as the ticket agent, now retired, was a circus buff. He writes about the circus and curates the circus collection at our university. Once at a fundraiser I bid on and won a painting of an Australian circus and donated that to the university circus collection. I’ve attended local art exhibits of paintings of the circus and its clowns. And recently, last May, I learned that my good friend Gary, who went to graduate school in theatre in this town, had done a thesis project on the circus and its local connections, gathering a group of…old….clowns together, putting a tape recorder in the middle of the table, and letting them talk over old times. So, if you visit Milner Library at Illinois State University in Normal, Illinois, and want to listen to clowns talk about the circus, listen to that!And my friend Susan used to teach voice and movement to clowns, yes, at Clown College in Sarasota, before it closed. What is the world coming to, that it has to close down its Clown College?Ah, but we still have the Actors Gymnasium!--which is receiving an award this month from the mayor of Evanston.By coincidence, when I first started at Babbitt’s, we got in a big bunch of circus books and ephemera. There were little circuses all over the country, and I have catalogued books and souvenir programs and documents from some of the places cited in Gruen’s acknowledgements on the copyright page of Water for Elephants: the collection of the Ringling Circus Museum, Sarasota, Florida; the Pfening Archives, Columbus, Ohio (I did not know of this when I lived for a year in Columbus, writing for an encyclopedia!); Tegge Circus Archives, Baraboo, Wisconsin. We have several circus books by a guy with an ax to grind, and several nostalgic reminiscences.And I think there is an actual literary magazine and press dedicated to circus writings, particularly the fliers, and/or to that particular kind of risk and thrill: Hanging Loose. (Is that right? Hanging Loose Press? Yes, this is a famous press, but it has nothing to do with the circus. It has to do with \"hanging loose\" pages, the poetry of the now. However, I think there is a press dedicated to circus-like risks and books, and that I have seen one of these.... Help?)But, book group. Are you in a book group? And, if so, what are you reading for it? And how do those discussions go? I am reading, soon, as soon as I purchase it, Clay’s Quilt, by Silas House. Last year, or the year before, as time sort of gets away from me and is circular, spiraling, or emanating from one moment, as in ripple on a pond, for me (have I mentioned that I can’t quite any more believe in linear time?) I read his book The Coal Tattoo because he was coming to town to speak about in our Tale for Two Cities thing (twin cities here, and Bloomington was actually the big circus town, I gather), our version of The Big Read before it was called The Big Read…I think, but arising from the same impulse to get people reading again, and talking to each about what they read. Anyway, Silas House is one charming, sweet, funny guy. And I am eager to read Clay’s Quilt and discuss it with my book group. The Coal Tattoo follows two sisters and a whole community through the ravages of coal mining, and it and Clay's Quilt are part of a trilogy. Silas House has a website/blog. (It is in fact here at blogspot!)What are you reading, or your own, or for a book group, and why?(And P.S., here's a link to an article from the Vidette at ISU about the circus collection in Milner Library and a book event there.)"},
{"title": "The mystery of defining things", "date": "Thursday, February 18, 2010", "text": "Day 9 of the \"What are you reading, and why?\" project, and I appear to have Internet, however briefly, this morning.  Why I have it sometimes and why I don't is a mystery to me.And that is why Jo was recently reading The Professor and the Madman by Simon Winchester.  She and some friends enjoy reading mysteries, and one of them recommended to her this real-life mystery about the writing of the Oxford English Dictionary.  This won't be a spoiler, as the book opens with the revelation that James Murray, the OED editor, has gone to meet Dr. W. C. Minor, one of his major contributors of definitions, and discovers that the writer lives in an asylum for the criminally insane.  And the book then lays out how this came to be!I remember first hearing about this book from my friend Gary, who is always asking people \"What are you reading?\" and it is always fun to find out what he is reading.  I discovered E. O. Wilson, and Consilience, through Gary, checking it out from the library to read it and then later finding it for $1 on the summer sale cart at Babbitt's and snatching it up to keep and re-read.  I have acquired more Wilson since, and went to hear him speak when he came to Illinois Wesleyan University a couple years ago.This must have been in 1998, when The Professor and the Madman first came out, as I couldn't read it right then.  So many books I've written about recently came out in 1998, when I had a fulltime teaching job, an 8-year-old and a 4-year-old.  Egad, how did I get any reading done?  Oh, yeah, I didn't.  I read what my students were reading and what they were writing, and I read to my kids.  Anyway, Jo gave me her used paperback copy, and now I remember that it opens each chapter with a pertinent definition, an organizing principle I loved the first time around.  It will be fun to re-read this one, in snippets, focussing on the words.A few years back, a family friend was dying who told us to take anything we wanted, and he had books, many, many books, and I inherited his OED, the two-volume mini-print set that requires a magnifying class.  (We get these at Babbitt's, too, glass and all, and sell them regularly.)  Somehow I failed to take, or find (his apartment was very, very crowded), the magnifying glass, so now I squint at the mini-definitions through my bifocals. I love definitions.  Definitions, multiple and layered, and word origins help me write poems.  They help me choose the precise word, and sometimes the word with a \"secret\" (like the kind actors sometimes carry around, developing a character) or, yes, a mystery.  Some of my poems thus contain words with very precise meanings that then keep unfolding if you learn that this word also means....or that the root of this word actually means....or that the irony here is that, over time, the word has come to mean the opposite of itself, etc.  I have retained an alternate and archaic spelling of a particular word in one poem because it then has its first meaning--to measure--and also its second meaning--to challenge.  Like Emily Dickinson, I love words!!So!  Words can contain mystery and history.  Winchester's is a book of nonfiction that reads with the delight and suspense of fiction, and particularly mystery. Meanwhile, Peg is reading Elizabeth Goudge, The Dean's Watch, which she identifies as \"sweet little historical fictional stories.\"  And that is indeed how I love to learn history, through fiction!Some even argue that a lot of history is fiction, in a sense--that historians have used their imaginations to piece all the clues together.  What do you think about that?"},
{"title": "Random acts of poetry", "date": "Wednesday, February 17, 2010", "text": "Day 8 of the \"What are you reading, and why?\" project. I am stressing the \"Why?\" in hopes that more of you will explain yourselves in comments! (Easier to do now, I promise! Anybody can comment, but there is a type-in-these-words filter, and an \"approval\" process. If you are not mean or swearing, I will approve you.)Yesterday I got a phone call at work from my friend Lorel, who was halfway through my book of poems and just had to call to tell me they were beautiful. Can you imagine how touched, moved, delighted I was? Wow! (Also, Michael and Kay, who answered the original \"What are you reading?\" question back on Facebook, are reading this same book, Broken Sonnets. They are hosting a birthday party, house concert, poetry reading, dance and guitar thing for me this Saturday. I am thrilled. I am going to see lots of old friends there, including Lorel, and meet some new ones, too! So I think we have an answer to the \"Why?\" question in this case.)Two young women were in Babbitt's at the time, looking specifically for poetry, love poetry, and Lorel said it would be OK to hand them my book, and I did, and one of them bought it! Hilarious, and also moving. The other bought Vita Nova, by Louise Gluck, at my recommendation, a Robert Creeley book, and others. We have great stuff tucked away on our poetry shelves at Babbitt's. No Robert Burns handy at that moment, as I had snatched up one copy and handed another to a man seeking poetry to read through his wife's belly to the baby in her womb! How's that for a random act of poetry?Lorel is also reading Olive Kitteridge by Elizabeth Strout, a set of linked stories about a retired teacher. (By chance, I am today revising a story that is taking me years to write about a retiring woman!) I love linked stories, but it seemed like a trend in fiction that came and went...but maybe is back?Let me know what you all think about linked stories, sort of a blur between a novel and a short story collection. What are the advantages and disadvantages, both of reading them and of writing them? I heard that agents/publishers are not so hot on them, but I don't know why. Might be one of those money-driven opinions, but short stories can be made into movies just as easily as novels can, in fact, more easily sometimes, yes?"},
{"title": "Glimmer Train", "date": "Tuesday, February 16, 2010", "text": "Day 7 of the \"What are you reading?\" project. (And still being kicked off the Internet at home...)Suzie is reading What the World will Look Like When All the Water Leaves Us, a collection of short stories by Laura van den Berg. That is one scary title! But it sounds like the stories mix big trouble with gentle insight in magical ways each time.I am also reading some short stories, interspersed with my other reading, which works because I am still reading a book of essays and a book of letters. I paused to read two stories by Paul Michel in back issues of Glimmer Train, a wonderful literary magazine edited by two sisters and published in Portland, Oregon. I was an early subscriber to this magazine, delighted by the policy of publishing pictures of the authors as children and having them comment on their work in \"The Last Pages.\" My mom also liked it from the start and has been a faithful subscriber ever after, so now I borrow her copies!So I read Michel's stories \"Say to the Waves\" in the Summer 2004 issue and \"Green\" in the Spring 2006 issue, and he will also have a story in the forthcoming Spring 2010 issue. Paul and I were at Kenyon College at the same time, and we recently reconnected at Facebook, which is why I love Facebook. Loved these short stories. \"Green\" gets the tornado sky of the Midwest, and the icky fear of it, just right, and then there is all this subtle family stuff going on, too. \"Say to the Waves\" is a story that grabs me and makes me care about these people I am just now meeting, and puts me right there on a bench with them.Paul has a new book coming out in April, Houdini Pie, and will be at the AWP conference in Denver this year to help promote it.What I always love about short stories is you can sit down and eat them. What I mean by this is what Richard Bausch says in his essay/letter \"Dear Writer,\" collected in the Letters to a Fiction Writer book edited by Frederick Busch. Bausch is first reissuing Fitzgerald's advice to his daughter Scottie that \"you must try to absorb...six good authors a year\" and goes on to say that \"you swallow them. You ingest them, and move on.\"I do look at reading this way. It sustains me. It keeps me alive, it helps me write. It is nutritious, good reading!"},
{"title": "Presidents Day", "date": "Monday, February 15, 2010", "text": "Day 6 of the \"What are you reading?\" project, and I have Internet this morning, but who knows for how long.Not long at all, as it happened.  I was thrown off the Internet in the middle of this draft, so I have come to work to complete it, and am not yet \"on the clock\" as they say.  (My boss gets Google alerts every time I mention Babbitt's here.  He is beside me at the moment, on the other computer.  He knows exactly what I am doing, never you worry!)So I'll tell you some of the interesting non-fiction/history/economics books people are reading this February.Linda, who is in England, is reading The Yorkshire Gentry from the Reformation to the Time of the Civil War.  Judith, who is on her way to India, is reading William Dalrymple's The Last Mughal.  It's always wonderful to imagine the scholars or journalists and professionally curious writers who grasp eras of history for us in these books.  The Mughals were the ruler descendants of Genghis Khan and company, and the power that came down from that first empire gradually dissipated....And Jude is reading Lords of Finance--the Bankers Who Broke the World by Liaquat Ahamed about other kinds of dissipation of power, etc.Julia is lusting after Bloomington-Normal Lost: An Account of Our Vanishing Architectural Heritage, published by the Old House Society of McLean County, which shows gorgeous houses and buildings of the past, and what's become of them now...some are of course gone altogether, replaced by charmless modern buildings or encased by odd additions.  She says her parents have a copy, lost somewhere in their house of antiques and collectables.  I think she'll be back today, at Babbitt's, to pick it up!And, on the history and Presidents Day theme, I am still reading Team of Rivals by Doris Kearns Goodwin.  I am still halfway through it because I lent it to my dad who was doing Lincoln-related research for the McLean County Museum of History, Illinois Voices, Evergreen Cemetery annual Discovery Walk, and I have not retrieved it.  I just want to finish it before the movie comes out, with Liam Neeson as Lincoln.  Poor guy.  Now he has that melancholy and terrible grief in common with Lincoln."},
{"title": "Valentine's Day", "date": "Sunday, February 14, 2010", "text": "Day 5...and no Internet access at home.  There's always something...So I wanted to tell you that Douglas is reading a biography of Jack Kerouac, who is always popular, so popular that we keep him on a little shelf right by the front door.  Well, Dharma Bums, etc. stay there a while, but On the Road always disappears immediately.And, likewise, forget finding a copy of Catcher in the Rye, especially the red paperback that used to be so readily available and in all high school classrooms!And to wish you a Happy Valentine's Day.  I hope to resume the project on this daily basis, but the Internet problem seems bound to foil me.A woman was reading a book at the terribly crowded breakfast place this morning, full of Valentine's parties...and shortly thereafter church parties.  I resisted the urge to go over and ask her what she was reading!"},
{"title": "Possession", "date": "Saturday, February 13, 2010", "text": "Day 4 of the \"What are you reading?\" project.I don't know how long I have here before I am disconnected again from the Internet. Not even sure if I am connected now, so I will be brief. (You are perhaps laughing, sighing, shaking your head, rolling your eyes. Or you are not here....Just like me.)1) I am math challenged, so I may lose count of the days here.2) I am traveling a bit soon, so I may miss some days, but I will still ask people what they are reading and report back later, still attempting to count days.3) I am technology challenged, so I don't know when I will really get this Internet connection thing figured out and fixed.4) Despite my technology challenge, I think I have now rigged it so you can comment here more easily. You'll have to enter those wacky letters. And I'll have to approve comment...but, hey, you're not spam!Julie is reading Possession, a wildfire bestseller some years back that did the impossible: made scholarly research sexy! And had poet characters! The new Keats movie* makes poets sexy, and I remember a West Wing with a sexy, flaky poet (who doesn't understand how things get done in the political process), and Richard Russo has some hilarity with poets--people actually scared of going to a poetry reading, because of the sex--in one of his novels. I would tell you, but it's very early, and I'm memory challenged this morning, and I can't remember the title.  Ah, Nobody's Fool!  And Straight Man was hilarious.  I gave it to the chairman of the English department as a sort of going-away present when he got to stop being chairman for a while, which I'm sure was a bit of a relief.  Rotating chairpersonship.  It skewers academia.  He was not a straight man, so I have a feeling he liked it a lot.In Possession two researchers try to get to the bottom of a possible romance between poets in the past--a sort of a breakthrough discovery if they can find proof. (One thinks of scientific discoveries this way, new planet, cure for a disease, international competition and cooperation, childbed fever.)Byatt is marvelous. She puts all sorts of things in her novels and intelligent complicated people. I read her trilogy that follows characters through years of cultural changes--The Virgin in the Garden, Still Life, Babel Tower. Then she added a fourth book! A Whistling Woman takes the characters up again. That's what my dad was just reading, as I had taken it to him saying, \"I know you want to write a novel and put all your ideas in it. Well, here a great example of how to do that!\" As in Chekhov, people have conversations in Byatt in which they can pour out grand ideas. Chekhov! Who's reading some Chekhov?!***Post-volleyball tournament note (with temporary restored Internet capabilities):...And I just learned that Mary is also reading Dickens! (Along with all the people in the \"What the Dickens...? entry.)  David Copperfield.  Dickens is in!  I think we can thank PBS for that!  Little Dorrit was sure fun to watch on PBS.  Talk about a wild, very, very hard-to-understand fabulously contrived happy ending!  But it was great to see in a movie how debtors' prison worked, as I always had a bit of a hard time picturing/understanding it when I read Dickens when younger.  David Copperfield was a wonderful read, as I recall. Read it twice, I think--once younger, once older.*Bright Star."},
{"title": "Court and Spark", "date": "Friday, February 12, 2010", "text": "Day 3 of the \"What are you reading?\" project.Yesterday a physicist came into the bookstore looking for St. Thomas Aquinas. I love my job. He wanted to know where the science section was, too. \"I'll take you!\" I said. \"Oddly enough, they are near each other, science and religion.\" It is not really that odd.My boss, a self-declared atheist, may have done this on purpose, arranging the store.... No, I think not.I paused during the ellipses to muse on \"Darwinism,\" an essay by Marilynne Robinson in The Death of Adam. I had just finished reading The Barbaric Heart by Curtis White and somehow knew, based on things I'd read about it in the past, that it was time to read The Death of Adam, so I asked my boss, \"Do we ever get The Death of Adam in here?\" I knew we never got Mother Country, which is way too expensive for me, new.He tilted his head. \"I just brought in my copy from home yesterday,\" he said. \"I realized I wasn't going to get around to reading it.\" So I got it for $5, plus my 20% discount. I love my job. Whenever we have a copy of Housekeeping, my boss presses it on the next sweet young woman who comes in asking for recommendations. (He does this with Gilead, too, his atheism not getting in the way of that recommendation.) This happens! People come in to browse, and who want to read a good book! Often, as with the physicist, this is when they are waiting for the train, as the Amtrak station is just across the tracks from us.Back to the physicist. We chatted a bit about Richard Feynman, and then I left him to his happy browsing. Somewhere in the middle of the conversation, I'd had the sudden insight of a sort rare to me that my interest in his reading habits might be misconstrued as...well, \"court and spark.\" So I skedaddled out of there.I will not go on and on about how stupid I am romantically, but I will say that I have engaged in many a conversation with a man, myself completely clueless about the possibilities sparking in him. Until too late. I will also say that back before Christmas a man came in to browse while waiting for the train to Texas, although he would be back after visiting his grown-up daughter, and I inquired as to his availability to date my recently divorced friend who was now ready to date. Courting and sparking on someone else's behalf! He handled it rather well. But he has not come back, and I may have scared him off used books forever.OK, so the physicist did not find any Aquinas (just as I did not find St. John of the Cross, Dark Night of the Soul, when I was looking for it a few years back; you can expect an entry about this interlude of my life sometime later; in additon to Dark Night of the Soul, I voraciously read any book I could find with the word \"desire\" in the title, plus a lot of Rumi), but he found two other books he wanted. I was not at the register at the time, and did not pry into his purchases, busy myself describing to a database a souvenir program of Walt Disney's Fantasia, published in 1945, but the conversation continued over the top of my computer, and I learned he was re-reading Crime and Punishment. RE-reading! Have I mentioned that I love my job?But I stray. All this is to get around to what Sally is reading: Girls Like Us--Carole King, Joni Mitchell, Carly Simon--and the Journey of a Generation by Sheila Weller. Sheila Weller is a writer for Vanity Fair, my guilty pleasure magazine. Sally says that those were the singers and the songs that got her through those crucial growing-up years! I have to confess that I came to them late, as I come to so many things, and that they are getting me through my midlife years! (Along with other great singer/songwriters, old and new. From Leonard Cohen to Eddi Reader to Lucinda Williams to The Weepies!) I remember when my high school English teacher said how much he loved the album Tapestry, by Carole King, and I had not heard of it, though I realize now I had heard all of the songs on the radio, and remembered most of the lyrics. How can I explain that somehow I grew up listening to showtunes and the Beatles? What journey was I taking? Why was I so out of sync with my own generation?Is it because, as I realized later, I do not actually believe in linear time? Ah, but that is a question to pursue with the physicist."},
{"title": "Blessings in Disguise", "date": "Thursday, February 11, 2010", "text": "Day 2 in the \"What are people reading?\" project, and I am glad I made a list on Day 1, because lots of people responded to the question over on Facebook!  Glad to see people commenting and following up here, to say more about why they are reading what they are reading!  And our focus here is print, hard copy!  What are people reading while holding the actual book in their hands?--though really I am happy about all reading, as it seems to encourage reflection.  I am just interested in how print is doing these days, and why some people still read it, want it, etc.  As well as our general choices, tastes, peferences, and the variety in them.So today I will riff on biography, autobiography, and memoir, as several people are reading those!  At Babbitt's Books, where I work, people often come and ask for the Biography section, and we don't have one.  The biographies are interspersed in the various other categories of history (by era), science, literary criticism, etc.  We do have a Belles Lettres section, a catch-all for actual letters, memoir, essays, and, yes, \"beautiful letters\" of all sorts.  (The Frederick Busch book, Letters to a Fiction Writer, would have gone in Belles Lettres, but I snatched it before it could go either online or on the shelf.  Sorry!  Sorry for you and for me, job hazard: very deep, very empty pockets.  Not sorry about the reading.  Lovely book.  I'll try to read a letter a day.)In our sports section, which has categories for different sports + miscellaneous, Fred might have found the biography of Vince Lombardi that he's reading now.  Bob would have looked for the biography of Raymond Carver in our lit crit section, although we might not have it yet, as it is still new, Raymond Carver: A Writer's Life, by Carol Sklenicka, and we are a used bookstore.  But we do get some very recent biographies right after people read them, and I found Personal History, Katharine Graham's autobiography at Babbitt's, along with A Tragic Honesty: the Life and Work of Richard Yates, by Blake Bailey, hardcover, first edition, first printing, signed!--published in 2003, before the release of the film Revolutionary Road, based on Yates's novel.  Poor Yates--it is a life so bleak I cannot yet get through it...and thus, poor Bailey!  But I will return to this one, to learn all I can about how to live in this world.And I want to know that, too:  Why are you reading a memoir, biography, or autobiography?  (And what is the difference between memoir and autobiography?  And--that Oprah show incident, and other cases, too!--what is the difference between memoir and fiction?!) I know I read everything, but especially accounts of real lives, to learn how to live in the world.Beth is reading Christopher Plummer's memoir In Spite of Myself, and I imagine it is because she admires him as an actor and is herself immersed in a life in the theatre.  This summer my dad, also a theatre person, was reading one of Alec Guinness's memoirs--he wrote more than one--and I picked it up when he was done.  Blessings in Disguise--a charming, gentlemanly memoir, told in vignettes.  I was delighted by Guinness's balance of honesty and discretion in talking about the people he had trained and worked with.  This was the out-of-print paperback, by the way, and my mom had picked it up for him at Babbitt's, but there is a new softcover printing out now, too.  Celebrity memoirs can be those kiss-and-tell books, or otherwise sensationalized, but they can also be honest and sweet accounts, pithy, funny, full of quiet revelations.Babbitt's also has a Star Bio section for those celebrity books, but in it you might find A Star Danced by Gertrude Lawrence, a book I first read as a teen, published in 1945, so my mother had recommended it to me.  It was on our shelf at Babbitt's the last time I looked, but things come and go...  My parents gave or recommended to me several books about writers and actors when I was growing up...and entering adulthood...hoping to help me make decisions about how to live in the world, what career to pursue, whether to be an actor or a writer.  My \"ambition\" (and I rather lack ambition, as outrageous as the coming confession will sound) was to be like Shakespeare--write, and play small parts on the stage.  Hmm...In crucial years, they gave me Respect for Acting, by Uta Hagen; The Bright Lights: A Theatre Life, by Marian Seldes; and Notes, by Eleanor Coppola, about her husband's making of the film Apocalypse Now.  This along with the advice about a life in the theatre: \"If you can do anything else, do it.\"  And, all along, they encouraged me in a writing life...  Hmm...Recently, I found this quotation by writer Paul Auster:Becoming a writer is not a 'career decision' like becoming a doctor or a policeman.  You don't choose it so much as get chosen, and once you accept the fact that you're not fit for anything else, you have to be prepared to walk a long, hard road for the rest of your days.I love this long, hard road, and it feels joyful, in a peaceful way. In college, I played Emily Dickinson in The Belle of Amherst by William Luce.  There is a poignant moment when she says, \"It seems I am going to be famous!\" when Thomas Wentworth Higginson is coming to visit her.  It seems she was not.  But that, too, was a blessing in disguise."},
{"title": "What the Dickens are you reading?", "date": "Wednesday, February 10, 2010", "text": "So today I am starting my \"What are you reading?\" project in earnest. Two people are reading Charles Dickens: Sarah is reading Oliver Twist and Ron is reading Pickwick Papers.  I am hoping they will come here eventually and comment on why they are reading these particular books at this particular time, but for now I will just riff a little on all this.First off, I will probably do informal research on the authors and books in that wonderful place we tell students not to use in their research papers: Wikipedia.  I love Wikipedia as a first place to look for info, because it gathers it all up in a lively way.  For real research, Iwould follow it all up in other sources, but for this blog...well, we'll see.  I'd like to think of the book itself and the people who are reading it as my main sources.  I want to know what you are reading, and why.Secondly, I want to write about what people are reading as hard copy, in print sources, to track how that's going.  I love all the info available on the Internet and I read both print and online literary journals, newspapers, magazine articles, etc., and links people send me.  But I work in a bookstore, and I like to see what people want to hold in their hands to read!  What they want to keep forever, or bring back and trade in, etc.  I am interested in the state of reading, in a general way, to better understand those scary statistics about the decline of reading, and in the specific way of who is still reading hard copy/print media, and why.  And, more specifically, books, hardcover or softcover.Thirdly, I work in a used bookstore.  I love books, and I buy some new, at the big bookstores, and at Amazon.com when I have a coupon and/or a desperate need.  Otherwise, I buy my books cheap, used, where I work, with my employee discount of 20%.  (Yesterday I bought Unless by Carol Shields, paperback, and Letters to a Fiction Writer, edited by Frederick Busch, hardcover, first edition, first printing.  I am a book addict.)  (I have read Busch's introduction so far, about a crappy rejection letter he got, and about more generous letters since, and the first letter, by Lee K. Abbott to his son, who also wants to be a writer.  The thrilling thing there is that Abbott tells his son what I have heard from other writers, too: you have to go deep, and tell them everything you think, feel, and know about life.  Permission to tell!)On the one hand, I am troubled by this (buying used, not the book addict thing; I accept my book addiction): the author is not getting a royalty.  On the other hand, I know authors want to be read.  Many authors are generous and want their books to be passed from hand to hand, resold so the less affluent can afford to read/keep a book, donated to the library book sale, so both the reader and the library benefit, etc.  A used bookstore is also a form of recycling.  (And, literally, a too-damaged book is one we do recycle locally; for hardcovers, we remove the cover and recycle the textblock.  And then I look for an artistic use of the hardcover, as well.)  So there are my confessions, disclosures, hopes.Pickwick Papers was, according to Wikipedia, Dickens's first complete novel.  I don't think I've read it.  Dickens is the guy who often composed/published his work serially, with readers waiting eagerly for the next installment.  I miss that!  But Harper's Magazine serialized Happyland by J. Robert Lennon a short while back.  (He has a website, a literary blog, etc.  You can start here to learn more about him: http://www.jrobertlennon.com/)  (Oops, straying wildly from the hard copy/print media focus already, but, hey Harper's a a print magazine, and that's where I read Happyland.)  I have read other Dickens novels, and recently watched Little Dorrit on PBS, online.  (Ditto.  Sigh.)  Anyway, my life has been entwined with Dickens.  I have fond memories of sitting in the theatre for the marathon performance of Nicholas Nickleby in Chicago and having muffins thrown at me!  I read David Copperfield in my teens, and likewise Oliver Twist.My first experience of Oliver Twist, however, was Oliver, the musical.  The film.  I was young enough to have been shocked by the darkness in it, that a character we come to know and love actually dies.  Even though it was a musical, not everything worked out.  And Fagin in the book is much darker than he is in the musical, or than he is, of course, in the Disney adaption, Oliver and Company, which I viewed with my children.  The character Fagin was based on a real man named Fagin.  It's no surprise that Dickens based many characters on people he'd seen, known, worked with, or was related to in life. Dickens is one of those writers who delves deep into family--exploring good relationships, troubled ones, various kinds of love and loyalty.  By coincidence--or is it synchronicity?--I am reading the essay \"Family\" in The Death of Adam right now.  And here's something I want to mention about my little \"What are you reading?\" project.  I have noticed that I read just the right thing at just the right time, which is coincidental, not supernatural, but everything else I read/notice at the time connects.  I think this is because I am attentive and see the connections, and because they are there.  We read and write our shared human experience.Sometimes I put a book down.  Usually this is not the writer's fault.  If I take up a book that someone has recommended to me, and I can't get into, it may be a matter of taste and preference, yes, and I may not take up that book again, but mostly likely, in my case, it is simply not the right time for me to be attentive to that particular book.  Two close reader friends, with whom I am in a book group, have recommended to me A Prayer for Owen Meany, by John Irving, as one of their favorite books of all time.  Three times I tried to read it.  My husband, not as avid a reader as I am, read it before I did.  But I did complete it last year, and, indeed, it is a wonderful book, a book that lives in me now, that taught me about the Vietnam War, and that spead my compassion wide and deepened my awe at the mystery of life.So tell me what you are reading, and why.  And let me know if you, too, experience that right-book-at-the-right-time phenomenon."},
{"title": "Up in the Air & \"What are you reading?\"", "date": "Tuesday, February 9, 2010", "text": "Here's what I wrote to a friend in email....about Up in the Air, seen recently with another friend:I have been thinking about the movie since I saw it. At the end, he stares at the infinity of choices of where to go with his remaining 9 million miles and lets go of the handle of his last bit of luggage. This makes me think he has let go of everything, job included, and is truly up in the air at the end, in the final narration, when he says that's him, that blinking light up there, when you look up into the night sky.I think he was as changed by the young woman as she was changed by him and by going around on the job and seeing the effect of being fired on all those people. The suicide was the last straw for her. The loss of his last chance to connect/commit to someone was the last straw for him. I think when he drops the letter of recommendation off at work and heads out the door, it is his last time in that workplace, really, even if he doesn't realize that till he gets to the airport and lets go of his luggage handle. As his love interest closes the door on him, she says to her husband, \"It's just some guy who's lost,\" and she's right. He's lost now, not knowing where he can land. So he might stay up in the air for quite some time, 9 million miles of time. And he was lost long ago, and now he knows it. When his sister says, \"You are non-existent to us,\" and gives him a chance to exist/connect, he learns about that.To me, there's a nice little paradox here. He is both lost and found, both homeless and better off. Ironically, what he says to the people he fires about now being able to follow their dreams sort of comes true for him. Now, detached from everything, he can follow his dream of being up in the air forever.All the good he did came from human connection--he convinced the fiance to marry his sister, gave them honeymoon miles, helped young woman get better job, brought joy to a lover. His lover, who was already connected to her family, also brought him joy, on what she thought were his terms--no attachment whatsoever, no worries. Having a little freedom & joy with him allowed her to stay connected to her family without treating them as things to stuff in a backpack and leave behind in an airport; whatever we think of her for doing that, it was consistent with what he was doing and what he was advocating in his public talks. I don't think she misled him; she just didn't burden him with the \"luggage\" of her own life, which is what she thought it would be to him.If I think of my human connections as \"luggage\" or burdens, I, too might be lost or might be careless of the feelings of others, might become the kind of person who can fire people for a living. If I think of my human connections, to you or anybody else I care about, as joyful and good, I feel light and free, but still attached.But I wrote this to a friend, and saw the movie, without having read the book. Must read book. Heard partial interview with author, who sees the book and the movie as separate things, so I will, too.Saw Julie & Julia again, and fell asleep, but that wasn't the movie's fault. And I was awake through the blog project genesis, and have been thinking further about this. I want to know what people are reading. By reading, I think I mean books. Printed books. I read magazines and journals, too, and both print and online media, but I want to find out who is still reading books. Which ones, and why.Today a fellow came into the bookstore--on this snowy, windy day, a \"snow day\" off school, in fact--and bought 4 books. Used bookstore, so a great deal--4 books for $16! He was from out of town and had to drive back in the wind and snow on the icy road...and had he driven all that way just to come to our used bookstore? No, I think he was in town for something else but couldn't leave without coming to our store. He was looking for Michael Pollan. So I know what he wants to be reading. We had a first edition of Pollan's gardening book for $35, not so affordable. But he found a nice range of other books, including Louise Erdrich.So what I want to know, from somebody, daily, is, \"What are you reading?\""},

Off soon to see Up in the Air, and finally just rented Julie & Julia, when it came back in at my local library, which makes me want to:1)  Cook.  Not really, but I do need to make a banana bread with those ripe bananas!2)  Start a fun project like that.  In my case, probably a poem a day.This means:1) I will add those blueberries to the banana bread.2) Even more people won't read my blog.Some people hated the whining, self-absorbed Julie.  I liked her just fine.  But, ah, Julia!"},

Here is the link to that:http://afollowspot.blogspot.com/2010/01/living-on-earth.htmlThe book is in that crucial advance sales period, when early sales help determine print run and keep publication on schedule. You can order here:http://www.finishinglinepress.com/NewReleasesandForthcomingTitles.htmwhere my current book, Broken Sonnets, is also still available to order easily in this way! That is very nice of Finishing Line to have the 2 books side by side with both International and PayPal ordering buttons!I am tickled to have 3 \"slim volumes of verse,\" as they say, sort of out there in the world. (The other is Selected Roles, a chapbook of theatre and persona poems based on my years as a professional actor, and it's available at Babbitt's Books.)http://www.babbittsbooks.com/I was listening to Piano Jazz on WGLT last night, our local NPR affiliate, about practicing music. People who get really good at what they do are practicing all the time, playing all the time, or, in Michael Jordan's case, playing basketball in the driveway all the time. Some of us are writing all the time, various forms, various ways. I write or revise a poem almost every day for great stretches of time (with some natural interruptions or periods of rest), so this is comforting and encouraging. If I keep doing this--daily, joyful, diligent practice--maybe I will be one of those people!I am still reading and re-reading The Barbaric Heart by Curtis White. I really like it. The narrative voice in this one is still passionate and funny but not as curmudgeonly as in The Middle Mind. He's just as much a social critic, primarily of the groups of which he is a member, thus practicing what he preaches about self-examination and self-criticism, but there's a stronger sense in this one of compassion, wide and deep.White gives voice to an impulse I felt way, way back in college (Kenyon College!), reading political philosophy for the first time, to raze everything. Not literally blow anything up, of course, just go back to the start, the heart of it all, the place in mind that allows for clarity of vision, courage, etc. First, see clearly, and then find the path."},
{"title": "To Haiti and Back", "date": "Thursday, January 21, 2010", "text": "Still reading All Over but the Shoutin' by Rick Bragg and still experiencing synchronicity in reading, waking, and dreaming life, now including my husband's dreams.Notes: My husband seldom dreams, he claims, or seldom remembers his dreams, but he remembered a dream pertinent to my opening sentence. And I have become a fan of Rick Bragg on Facebook. Sigh....I still can't believe I am on Facebook, and I still can't believe I have a blog.Rick Bragg went to Haiti to report on phenomenal violence and suffering there. While he certainly described a hell on earth there, I don't think it was from a pact with the Devil, to discount Pat Robertson here. So while I was hearing and seeing news about the devastation caused by Haiti's earthquake, I was also reading about an earlier period of suffering in this book.Then my husband woke up yesterday morning recalling a weird dream. He saw two old men with long beards who looked very familiar to him, as if he knew them from life or other dreams. They looked wise and calm, expectant. He spoke to them, and they said they were waiting to get into the asylum. They looked hopeful about this. As he told me about it, he was realizing that this was how they would be taken care of in their old age--live somewhere warm, be fed. They were perhaps hoping to appear crazy enough to be accepted into the asylum. Perhaps the aspiration to end there would be sufficient proof!At the end of his telling, he considered that maybe the two old men were us! This was how we could be tended in our old age and not be a burden on our children. We are certainly a little crazy. And I am certainly just as much the man in our family as he is! I sure hope my beard doesn't grow that long, though.Anyway, to get on with the synchronicity of this, then I read in the Bragg book about the serial diner, a fellow who would order fine dinners in Manhattan and then not pay the bill so he could be arrested and sent to jail, where he could be sheltered and fed.Now, in Bragg, I am about to begin a chapter in which he returns to Haiti. Hence, To Haiti and Back."},
{"title": "All Over but the Shoutin'", "date": "Saturday, January 16, 2010", "text": "I am reading All Over but the Shoutin' by Rick Bragg, published in 1997. Again, I read things when I get around to it, when they are chosen by my book group, when something compels me to read a particular book at a particular time. Or to re-read it. Right now I am struck by this passage about the Korean War:The dead waved from the ditches in Korea. The arms of the soldiers reached out from bodies half in, half out of the frozen mud, as if begging for help even after their hearts had cooled and the ice had glazed their eyes. They had been shot to rags by machine guns and frozen by a subzero wind, leaving olive-drab statues in the killing, numbing cold in the mountains in the north.I read this to my husband while he was shaving, before he set off for volleyball practice (he's the coach), because it relates to his paintings. He paints bodies or portions of bodies in agony (sometimes indistinguishable from ecstasy) and often emerging from water or mud. He understood immediately and said he'd read about the terrible conditions and cold of Korea during that war.This, like The Tender Bar, which we also read for my book group, is a memoir by a man with a strong and admirable mother and a troubled and troubling father. Again, writers coping with their fathers, something I've been told I have to do if I'm a writer, and something I just keep avoiding. I notice that both these memoirists are honoring their mothers as they cope with their fathers, a pattern I might of course repeat.We read The Great Gatsby, at my suggestion, after The Tender Bar by J. R. Moehringer, because the locale is the same, and the consequences of \"careless people.\" I love the intersections of fiction and nonfiction, past and present.So this passage grapples with that vision, that experience of war. My husband's paintings tend to grapple with his sense of loss, alienation, the violence of being ripped from the mother country. He is painting hands right now, and music is being composed and a dance choreographed in response to his hand paintings, to be performed in early April at Columbus Dance Theatre in Columbus, Ohio. More about that as it comes up."},
{"title": "The Road", "date": "Friday, January 8, 2010", "text": "This morning I finished The Road by Cormac McCarthy.  My husband and son had read it and handed it over to me.  It is indeed a bleak and yet beautiful book, as people had told me.  The prose style is so compelling!  It is not ostentatious in any way, but it makes use of both rare and precise words, something I love to see.  And it is not as honey-heavy as Marilynne Robinson's prose style in Housekeeping or Gilead (Home is upcoming reading for me, too!), but it demands that same close attention.  I like that in a prose style!This year I will keep a list of books read in 2010, as a friend does, whose list I always enjoy.  Also keeping a list of movies viewed, as the family loves to watch movies together and sometimes discuss them....sometimes just ponder and feel together but on our own.  But if we have the movie in common, we can refer to it later in a conversation about human things.  \"It's like that scene in...,\" we can say.My most recent Wow! film of the year is Synecdoche, New York.  As with books, which I read eventually, I see movies when I can--often when they are available at the local library!These two connect in an odd, bleak, and loving way.  The devastation of the set at the end of SNY is like the devastation of the world in The Road.  There is fear, rage, hatred--people are capable of doing appalling things to one another.  And there is undeniable love, human connection.  But SNY is also about making art.  There, it seems like such a waste to harm or neglect one another for the sake of making art.  I suppose whatever we are making, or doing, there is terrible waste in harming or neglecting one another.  In The Road, everything we made or did turned out to harm us, or to waste our lives and damage our world.Seems like we are in a turnaround now.  We are paying close attention to the prose style of our lives."},
{"title": "Musing a Bit on Prostitution", "date": "Monday, December 21, 2009", "text": "So, in John Irving's novel A Widow for One Year, there is quite bit of time spent in the Red Light District of Amsterdam, which I happened to walk through when I was 14 or 15.  I was a little bit shocked then, mostly amazed.  I think having been there probably enhanced my tolerance and compassion for this kind of work later, as a grown up, having read a lot more about a lot of things.Notably, the connection between sexuality and spirituality and some things about sex workers and the sex trade.  I don't want anyone to be forced into sex work, or kidnapped, or offered some legitimate job as a waittress or seamstress, only to be trapped into prostitution.  But I liked the idea that young women could observe in order to find out if this was work they wanted to do.  I doubt that very many women or men with other options do want to do this work, but some surely do.  So I don't want the work to be looked down on, nor the workers to be in terrible danger, especially since this is known as \"the oldest profession\" and the demand never stops.  I am glad there are spots--in Amsterdam or Nevada--where the work is legal, regulated, and somewhat safe.Nor do I believe all the people who dismiss prostitutes or porn actors as having fully chosen their line of work.  Many haven't.  Choice was absent, minimal, or compromised in complicated ways.And I sure came to love or care about the prostitutes in Irving's novel, yet another testament to his storytelling skills.  I care about all the people in his books, even the assholes, as I can hope they will change...for instance, if they read his novels.  (Snake eating its own tail a bit there, I know.)To all the sex workers who chose their work and like it and want it, happy holidays.  To all who don't, I hope you find a safe way out."},
{"title": "A Widow for One Year", "date": "Sunday, December 20, 2009", "text": "This was one of those odd days, full of coincidences.  It is Maud Gonne's birthday, and this bit of Yeats was posted at the Writer's Almanac today, in celebration of it:Had I the heavens' embroidered cloths,Enwrought with golden and silver light,The blue and the dim and the dark clothsOf night and light and the half light,I would spread the cloths under your feet:But I, being poor, have only my dreams;I have spread my dreams under your feet;Tread softly because you tread on my dreams.This is also on p. 513 of John Irving's novel A Widow for One Year, which I finished up today, reading the Yeats verse shortly after seeing it at the Writer's Almanac.  Since Yeats is quoted earlier in the book, too, I was having this folding-over deja vu feeling....and all of this happened shortly after watching Stranger Than Fiction again with my daughter, who woke up wanting to watch that movie with her breakfast today.  I cried at the end, at the lovely narration.Then I told her that I do think fiction can save our lives.  I alluded again to the \"news of the world\" that can be found in poems, something I'd told her about earlier this year.  Some of us can only do art; it is our thing to do in the world.  \"Whatever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might.\"  My hand writes.  My mind reads and writes, all the time.  It is what I have found to do.  I get so tired of people who tell us to do something else, or think there is only one thing to do and we should all be doing it.  \"Make money\" or \"Social justice\" or whatever it is.  If you want to make money, go make it!  If you are capable of enacting social justice, enact some!  I will, in my quiet ways, do what I can do best.  Which is not, evidently, those two things!  But please don't judge or terrorize me for that.This is a nice novel from 1998, which I am just getting around to reading now.  I was busy in 1998.  But I tend to read things at the right time.  I mentioned here that I had started A Prayer for Owen Meany several times before reading it straight through, and I read it, not knowing its full subject matter, after revisiting the Vietnam War through a museum exhibit.  Everything came together.  So now I am in another John Irving phase, it appears.  I read one bad review of his newest novel, the kind of review that reminds me why I don't like to read reviews.  Leave him alone!  Let him write.  He cares about people and their happiness.   He knows crap happens, and he writes about that, too.  This is his form of social justice.  And it's how he makes money.  Let him.  It's what the world keeps indicating that it wants.  Then, when somebody does it, you get jealous and kick him.  Or call him sentimental or predictable.  Sigh...Anyway, I like Billy Collins, too.  Sue me."},
{"title": "The Seamstress", "date": "Thursday, November 26, 2009", "text": "I am reading The Seamstress by Frances De Pontes Peebles for a book group I'm in.\"As seamstresses, both she [Emilia] and Luzia knew how to cut, how to mend, and how to conceal.\"  This of course reads as metaphor for things we might do in life, or things we might do as writers or poets, as well as things we would do as seamstresses.  Good and great seamstresses also have to know how to be meticulous in taking measurements, and the really great ones can envision the garment on the body and in pieces, cut and laid flat on the table.  Umm, Dexter flash there.  The cloth, not the body, are cut up in pieces in that last passage...though there are some decapitations in the novel, as it turns out.\"Any seamstress could be meticulous.  Novice and expert alike could fuss over measurements and pattern drawings, but precision didn't guarantee success.  An unskilled seamstress delivered poorly sewn clothes without trying to hide the mistakes.  Good seamstresses felt an attachment to their projects and spent days trying to fix them.  Great ones didn't do this.  They were brave enough to start over.  To admit they'd been wrong, throw away the doomed attempts, and begin again.\"Now this last was both inspiration and comfort.  I have indeed thrown away sections of my life and whole poems, or major parts of poems, starting all over again!  There are times when this can make me, or anybody, feel like \"a quitter,\" and aspects of our American culture that certainly reinforce that.  But now that the American \"career\" is switching over to perhaps 10 years per job before a major change, and 1-3 year stints before a 10-year commitment even begins, this attitude may change.  I always love the excitement of change and new beginnings, keeping the edge, not being bored, etc. in work life.  As a writer, I can indeed let something go, however much I love it, if the needs of story or poem itself are other than my needs.I was talking to my daughter yesterday about this, showing her two poems I'd been working on and had let sit long enough to drastically reduce and alter so they could breathe and speak.   When I was younger, I didn't know to do this...then I learned it could be done, but it was hard...and now it is a way of being for me.I hope this means I am capable of becoming a great \"seamstress\"!"},
{"title": "Reading my own poems....", "date": "Saturday, October 24, 2009", "text": "Aauugghh!  I just wrote about self-absorption, and for the past few days, I have been reading little packets of my own poems over and over!  Well, it's actually the responsible and generous thing to do, and I know that, but it's making me feel self-absorbed!  Did I say, \"Aauugghh!\"There are several readings coming up, and I need to gather, practice, and time my work so I don't exceed the time limit!  And so I feel prepared and comfortable reading!  And know what I'm going to say in the little preparatory remarks!The first is our Living History poetry reading at the McLean County Museum of History.  Seven of us will be reading, the 7 current participants in my Poetry at Babbitt's drop-in workshop at Babbitt's Books.  It's an hour-long program, 7:30 to 8:30, and the museum closes at 9:00 p.m., and it is courteous to stick to the publicized time, let people go after an hour of poetry (potty break, etc.), and leave time to chat with poets and each other and exit the museum, and leave time for us to chat and also help clean up!  So I've told everyone 3-5 poems, 5-7 minutes, and keep rehearsing my own poems, down to 4 very pertinent and appropriate ones, but one is long and so I keep timing out at 10 minutes.  This is annoying!  Ultimately, I may cut yet another poem even though it went out on some of the PR!I am also doing an hour program for the Mornings with the Professors program at Illinois State University on November 6.  I'll be talking about inspiration, composition, and revision of particular poems and need to give them a packet of them to look at while I read aloud.  So I keep refining the packet--it was a dozen poems, then I added 3, thinking it was too short, so I had 15.  Then I read aloud, adding the explanatory material extempore, and it was too long, so I took 3 out, not exactly the same 3....still too long, and now I'm down to ten.  I think this is the right number!Meanwhile Broken Sonnets should be mailed out on Monday, to me and to those who pre-ordered it from Finishing Line Press, and those two readings are coming up in November and December, so I will be rehearsing, and timing, and self-absorbed all over again all too soon!"},
{"title": "Plainsong", "date": "Friday, October 16, 2009", "text": "I have been re-reading Plainsong by Kent Haruf in preparation for a meeting of the book group I'm in. I understand this was on our President's summer reading list, too. It's a lovely book that shows people being both mean and decent to each other, which is the way life really is, in a way that encourages us to choose and admire decency. Nice thing to read in an age where much of the culture seems to choose and admire mockery and meanness!I've been pondering the self-absorption of writers and artists a bit, too. I am one, so it seems OK, possibly even decent, to ponder it--the risks, the strategies to avoid too much self-absorption, the evidence. Recently I joined Facebook, on the recommendation of friends, and it's a good way to stay connected and re-connect with old friends, I agree. And for several years I've belonged to an Internet writing site, where people can share and \"workshop\" their stories and poems, but also, more recently, keep up with each other's personal as well as professional lives in online journals and blogs.   I have about a dozen people at one site with whom I stay pretty connected, and many friends at Facebook, of course, but a smaller number who regularly post a comment or a \"Like.\"  I scatter myself around and post little comments and \"Likes\" pretty frequently, as human connection is good!  It seems decent to let my pals know I see what they are saying!At both places, I notice the phenomenon of people who post pretty constantly, but seldom comment on the postings of others. It's the old Read me, read me, engage with me, but don't expect me to read you or engage with you thing. I should not be surpised, but somehow I am still irked. Of course, some of them are lurkers...reading but too shy or insecure or jealous or...well, what? what is it?...too something to let another person know they are there. The only catchall word I can find is \"self-absorbed,\" so that's the way I think of it.At work, I read a fabulous fun introduction by Ray Bradbury to a collection of 13 tales by Theodore Sturgeon, a writer he admired and that's why he was gathering the material and editing the book. The introduction was generous, very funny, and very admiring but also boiled down to the wonderfully honest admission I can summarize (and nearly directly quote) as this: You are such a good writer, I hate you. I am jealous of your talent and success, and I hate you. I have read your work all these years, and I love it, and now I am doing this. And I still hate you.It gets at the jealousy/rivalry thing, and of course we know Bradbury doesn't really hate Sturgeon. He loves him. But that little irksome kernel of hatred is still there!Nonetheless, Bradbury behaves decently--connects with the man, does him a service, promotes his work, writes to and about him. And really, deep inside and blazoned on the outside, and spiced with humor, loves him.OK, let me go a teensy bit further here. I read the work of my poet friends. If they tell me about a journal they are in, I order that issue or go to that website. If they write a book, I buy it. (A few times, I've received the book as a gift, or in trade, or as a review copy, by chance, but mostly I buy it. Often, I have to save up to do so and can't buy it right away.  I have mouths to feed at home.) Then I let the friend know I have read the book, or received the book, or read the individual poem.  I try to convey my thanks and delight and support earnestly, honestly, and without too much gush, which might embarrass them.I have to say I seldom receive the same courtesy or encouragement back.  It sort of astonishes me.  Mainly because often these same people DO respond to my communication of support with great thanks--\"I'm so glad you enjoyed the book,\" they'll say. \"It's nice to know someone is reading it.\" As if no other friends have let them know! Or, \"You are the first one to really get what I was trying to say,\" which indicates that friends have commented, but not specifically or intelligently, probably not reading closely enough...or maybe at all?So why don't these same people ever say something friendly, or encouraging, or specific back to me?!OK, that's my moaning self-absorbed, self-pitying moment of the day. Now I'm off to make some roasted red pepper soup!"},
{"title": "The Sun", "date": "Wednesday, October 14, 2009", "text": "I've been reading The Sun, October, 2009.  I love The Sun.  I first received it as a gift subscription and have maintained it ever since, except for maybe a 6-month period when life was disrupted....  I like pretty much everything about it, down to the letters to the editor, which have the same excruciating honesty as the Readers Write section.  I love the poems, I love the stories, I love the essays, and I love the general outlook--which contains generosity, liberalism, optimism, and realism in just the right mix.I have based poem assignments for my little class on poems found in the pages of the The Sun!  I have found and contacted some of its writers by email, to thank them for their work, and I have shared particular pieces with my mom, my son, my daughter, and a friend recently.  Stuff in The Sun makes us think of our individual relationships, and our own lives, and do particular things about them.My friend who gave me the original subscription just borrowed the August issue, which has an article/interview on deep breathing exercises that can do the same thing LSD can do to the brain, but safely.  She had misplaced or loaned out her copy, and needed to share the article with a friend; likewise, I want to share the article with my sister, an expert on deep breathing, yoga, theatre, body/mind.  I had already discussed this particular article with my daughter, recently a Beatles fan, and alerted to altered states, thanks to the film Across the Universe with all those great Beatles covers.  Same friend also loaned me all those issues from the subscription lapse, but she wants them back! So The Sun inspires a lot of sharing, but also some \"keeping,\" some treasuring.I recommend reading it, then subscribing.  One thing I love about it is that it has no ads.  We subscribers keep it alive.  That, too, is a direct relationship, and a kind of deep sharing. And it keeps the editor, Sy Safransky, free.  Independent and free."},
{"title": "A Walk in the Cemetery", "date": "Monday, October 12, 2009", "text": "It's been a long time since I wrote in this particular blog...alas.  I blog elsewhere as a version of myself, a funny version, and I write in a regular journal with a pen, and I write poems, etc., etc., but lately I've been very busy and not writing about what I'm reading, which is what I mostly intended to do here.I've been in the cemetery, in fact.  As Sarah W. Davis, the wife of David Davis and a contemporary of Abraham Lincoln.  Lincoln and Davis rode the circuit together in Illinois--remember those stories about books in Lincoln's saddlebags?--and one season Sarah and her son went along, literally, for the ride!  She had 7 children, but only 2 lived to adulthood, and after the loss of one child she took her son George with her to join her husband and Lincoln and spend what today we'd call \"quality time\" together.  When Davis was a judge in Washington, she wrote him many letters.  When she and her husband were in Chicago on business in April, 1865, she wrote a letter to her surviving children, telling them that their father would start that night, Easter Sunday, April 16, for Washington to attend to the affairs of the assassinated president.  I just performed that letter in Evergreen Cemetery in Bloomington, Illinois, where Sarah is buried.It was a pretty intense experience--the grief and anger at the loss of our President! Recreated sometimes 16, sometimes 24 times a day, for schoolchildren on field trips or for the general public on weekends.  Some days it rained.  The last day it was 38 degrees!  But audiences came and loved it, as they do every year.  This year, all the characters--who are real people buried in the cemetery--had some connection to Lincoln, as it's his 200th birthday.  What an honor to work with fellow actors, writers, and museum volunteers who put this event together.So I've been busy, scattered, and focussed for the past several weeks--preparing for this, finishing up other tasks, and carrying on a normal family and work life. I've kept reading, I've had thoughts, whole paragraphs have spun out in my head, but....sigh....More to come."},

(Fortunately, I get an employee discount, most are quite cheap to begin with, I can trade for books I bring in from home, and some are even free, donations that would otherwise go to library or sometimes even recycling!) So when I saw The Garden of Reading: An Anthology of Twentieth-Century Short Fiction About Gardens and Gardeners, edited by Michele Slung, and containing \"Grape Harvest\" by Colette, I snapped it right up. (I brought in 3 trade paperbacks from home to trade for this hardback, first edition, second printing.)This short story is what I meant about Colette in my previous entry, my similarity to her. She talks about the grapes, other fruits, food in general, the landscape, the sunshine, sweat, blushing--all human and sensual or sensory and natural things.The book contains quite an array! \"The Tree\" by Rosamunde Pilcher, \"How the Crab Apple Grew\" by Garrison Keillor, \"Earth to Earth\" by Robert Graves, \"The Lawnmower Man\" by Stephen King, \"A Curtain of Green\" by Eudora Welty, and even \"See No Weevil\" by James Thurber. I can't wait to read more! Even Barbara Pym is here with \"So, Some Tempestuous Morn.\" She's another I've been compared to, as a writer, oddly enough, as she seems the opposite of Colette. Pym is subtle and restrained where Colette is lush and free. And Pym is also very funny, as I recall.***pause to read story, to ponder comparisons***This is indeed a first edition, the kind with numerous little typographical errors--missing punctuation and capitalization, letters misread (scanned?) leading to things like \"lie\" instead of \"he\" and \"lip\" instead of \"up,\" but I have been able to decipher what was meant in the Pym story. It is a first U.S. edition, so the corrections were not made from the first UK edition, and if there is never a second edition, no corrections will ever be made. Still, a pleasant reading experience--just of the thought of this gathering is a delight. As is reading Pym again. And Colette.So, this comparison thing. People like to pigeon-hole, to categorize. I understand categories as a way to arrange and remember thoughts--a classical rhetoric kind of thing, memory enhancer, logic inducer. And then applied to science, as a way to arrange our discoveries and definitions of species. But the categories do not always fit, or hold. Likewise, with comparisons.People compare me to other writers because they don't know what to do with me. Perhaps I am an original, and they want to figure me out by comparing me to Pym or Colette, such different writers. Or perhaps I am not original enough, not yet creating my own category. On the other hand, as it sometimes takes years and years for a poem or a set of my poems to find a home, perhaps I am original indeed, more like--yes, a comparison!--Emily Dickinson!I do retreat into the chapel of my own back yard, the wild Edenic garden there, the gradual prairie restoration via wildflowers and perennials, many from seed (various daisies, purple coneflower, pinks, love-in-a-mist, sweet alyssum, golden columbine, nasturtium) but also clippings and transplants (hosta, spiderwort, bleeding heart, mountain bluet, coral bells, Sweet William, pink yarrow). The nasturtium are annuals, but they grow so well here. I planted them late, after the wild violets bloomed, thinning them out to make room, so we will have bright red, orange, and yellow blooms a little later in the season.I write at our picnic table (husband's 50th birthday present from Chicago and Michigan friends a few years back) in morning or evening.Also blooming: red clover, which has somehow survived the rabbits, daylilies. The golden columbine are dropping seed, and I am gathering some, too, and also the seed of wild purplish red columbine from along the fence, to plant in the fall for next season. The bleeding heart dropped seed, too, so I hope it will spread where it is, coming up after the red tulips. And this was a good year for deep purple iris, too, which I had dug and moved around last fall to encourage growth.Comparisons. If I write a \"nature poem,\" some compare me to Mary Oliver when I am more like Louise Gluck, if like anyone, in The Wild Iris, my favorite book of poetry. Edgy, and all about God, whatever God is, and the gritty small truths, side by side with the majestic ones, about Nature. And beauty."},
{"title": "The Fog of War", "date": "Monday, July 6, 2009", "text": "Tonight I had \"a driveway moment\" or rather \"a garage moment\" with NPR, Terry Gross playing her interview with Robert McNamara shortly after he published his memoir, In Retrospect: The Tragedy and Lessons of Vietnam, followed by her interview with filmmaker Errol Morris of The Fog of War: 11 Lessons from the Life of Robert S. McNamara.  That was a fabulous documentary, very brave and complicated, paradoxical, yes, somehow evoking a fog.I ran in from the garage and turned on the radio on the kitchen counter, moving from my daughter's pop station back to WGLT, the local NPR affiliate, to hear the rest.  Fresh in my mind is the Vietnam exhibit at the local history museum, a very thorough explanation and depiction of the larger context of the war and of its very real and personal effects on local people--soldiers, family, protesters, journalists--as well as the country and the world.  I grew up during that time but was too young to understand it, or to protest it, though I knew something was wrong about it.  I have spoken since to veterans, seen the documentary, read some of the literature that emerged from that difficult time, seen some of the feature films.McNamara's agony impressed me, as did his loyalty to the president who asked him to serve, Kennedy, and then the president who took over, Johnson, and to our country.  He really believed, as I did, growing up, that a nuclear war would be the end of the world as we know it, and that the Cold War was a troubling thing, and I see better now, \"in retrospect,\" how this must have factored into his difficult decisions to support a war that troubled him.  I was moved in the interview when he spoke of the Quaker who burned himself under McNamara's window to protest the war.  Here was an action like that of the Tibetan monk who burned himself to draw attention to the war.  Before that, so many Americans went blithely on, not realizing the trouble.Poor McNamara.  What a dilemma, seeing the war as \"unwinnable\" and still sending soldiers to it, knowing about Agent Orange, and still exposing soldiers and civilians to it.  What a weight of trouble and evil.  But he must have felt the alternative was even worse.  Hard to know what he thought--that fog again.Anyway, now he'll rest in peace."},
{"title": "Wait!  I'm on Facebook?!", "date": "Wednesday, July 1, 2009", "text": "Yes, it has happened.  Numerous people, including my sister, my friend Kim, and my dad, suggested Facebook as a nice place to post photos and reconnect with old friends, so I've done it.  I'm there.  (And I've linked from there to here, in my dubiously vague technological way.)And indeed it is nice.  I found my friend Dan, who had just gotten married, and old friends from high school, college, graduate school, City News Bureau, and theatre and poetry strands of my life.  When I say I've done a lot, I mean it.  There are whole sections of my life that I've sort of lost track of...truly forgotten...but then a little tidbit of information will set the memories tumbling out.Also, I would like to put people in touch with each other.  I am a bit like Amelie from the film Amelie in that regard.  People who saw that film have actually pointed this out to me, and the corollary aspect: that I need to get my own life together and/or figure out what I want, not just help other people fall into happiness.  (I think I have fallen into happiness lately, by just falling, free-falling, letting go...into a deeper kind of acceptance.  I will never figure out \"what I want\" as I seem to live quietly inside what is, and all the trouble I've ever had was from wanting something, or thinking I did.  Does this mean I'm finally a Buddhist?!  Probably not.  See Molly Peacock's poem, \"Why I Am Not a Buddhist\" for further illumination.)  When I began this paragraph, I mean to offer, as a specific example, that, on Facebook, I told my friend Dan about my friend Curt's gig on Thursday night at a bar in Brookfield, Illinois, as he is much closer than I am and might actually be able to go!  They don't know each other.  But they might enjoy each other, and they have people and geography and some experiences in common.  That's the Amelie-on-Facebook aspect of all this.My sister and niece sent me a Which Tarot Card Are You? test thingy, and I took it, and I am the Queen of Wands.  (This is either phallic or magical.  Or both.)  Here's the little description:The essence of fire behaving as water, such as a rainbow: The natural embodiment of passion and sensuality, who is always the center of attention. One who reflects the desires and ambitions of others, and ignites them. A radiantly vital person, cocky and charismatic, who sees what she wants and goes after it.So, some of this fits, and some exactly contradicts what I just said about never knowing what I want.  Maybe it means I know what I want in that particular moment--a spontaneity, trust-the-universe kind of thing--or maybe it means I have always wanted the same thing: a quiet happy life loving family and making art.  And I only ever do that.  If I try something else, I fail (which is always good, as it teaches me something, even if I don't interpret it correctly at the time and have to keep re-learning it, a kind of reincarnation) or walk away, and go back to the thing I really want (which remains mostly unknown to me except in the moment I articulate it and in this ongoing elemental way).  Long, rambling, complex, self-absorbed sentences!  That's also me.Somehow, yes, I reflect the desires and ambitions of others, and ignite them.  Sigh....And somehow, yes, people perceive me as passionate and sensual, and I probably am...but they take it to mean something else about me.  I am these things in a Colette kind of way--enjoying the natural world, the company of women as well as men, in a kind of sustained innocence.  Hard to explain, but I'm it....pause for pseudo-research....Except for most of the facts and details of Colette's life!  Um, I just read the Wikipedia article on her, and she was, well, firmly bisexual, for instance.  I am not.  I am, er, firmly heterosexual.  But I can kiss a woman professionally onstage, and have.  Me, Colette, Madonna. I was/am an actor and writer, but not like Colette: not enslaved by a philandering charlatan husband, and not ever wildly (financially) successful!  But I have read her short pieces about the natural world and they are touching and beautiful, and that's what I mean!Fire behaving as water, eh?  I connect with water, and am a Pisces, and like to swim and, if there were another animal life for me, I'd like to be a dolpin.  Maybe I was!  Fire, eh?  Rainbow, eh?  Radiant, eh?  Well, people do call me radiant.   What do they mean?"},
{"title": "Deep red-orange daylilies", "date": "Thursday, June 25, 2009", "text": "Deep red-orange daylilies suddenly appeared in my garden, below the tall spotted orange ones. Over in the daisy area, orange instead of yellow daisies opened, too. Is this a response to the heat, the recent rain? I love the wonders of nature, slight variations, etc. I see why Loren Eiseley and Charles Darwin and other naturalists and scientists get excited by all the little changes!It also feels, in a purely coincidental way, like a quiet little commemmoration of the deaths of Michael Jackson and Farah Fawcett, themselves suddenly joined by coincidence. They were part of my childhood; their deaths bring change of a non-garden variety very close.Tomorrow I will walk in the heat to the local university campus to teach a little poetry workshop to a group of writing fellows, with the Illinois State Writing Project. Then over to the bookstore to work a bit, if there's something appropriate to do, then lunch with a co-worker and former co-worker. Later, there's a visitation for a friend's mother. Then a \"date\" with my husband at an art opening. Busy day indeed.But each morning starts these days with lap swimming at the local outdoor pool. I love being in the water."},
{"title": "I Googled myself...", "date": "Wednesday, June 24, 2009", "text": "...I Googled myself, which is good to do now and then to find out what anyone might be saying about me (sigh...usually nothing...) and discovered myself to have won an Honorable Mention in the New Women's Voices competition at Finishing Line Press!http://www.finishinglinepress.com/newwomensvoices.htmThis is delightful news.  The same thing happened to me last year, with the same press!  I was a finalist in last year's open chapbook competition, and, since they offer publication to all 10 finalists, I have book coming out this fall, called Broken Sonnets. You will soon (around July 16) be able to order it at their New Releases page, same link as above, just seach for link at top of page. The new book is called Living on the Earth, and that publication process will start in a while, and take a while.  But I will post links to advance sales, etc.....as soon as I figure out how!I signed up here in order to leave a comment at someone else's blog, and here I am!  Apparently I was here before, as I already had an account I had forgotten about and had to reset my password, something that will no doubt come back to haunt me...but I'll cross that little technological bridge when I come to it.  Sigh...I do a guest column called \"The Poetry Cart\" at the Web Log for Babbitt's Books, where I work, so I have added that to the blogs I follow here.  Please feel free to add comments there, to visit the store in person, and/or to order books online.  It has a great selection of poetry, rare books, ephemera, lots of cool stuff.I am a poet, in various print and online publications, and I fear things like Facebook and MySpace.  I am so...technologically challenged and old-fashioned.  But I read a lot of poetry and will perhaps comment on it here!I love reading in general, so I may comment on books in general here, too.  I don't have much of a web presence, or my own web page yet, though everything around me says I must, sooner or later...but in the meantime, you can find me here!"}
